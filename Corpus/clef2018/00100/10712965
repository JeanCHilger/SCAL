Balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty in the neonatal period. The clinical and echocardiographic effects. To analyze the efficacy of balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty (BPV) as the elective treatment for neonatal critical pulmonary valvar stenosis (PVS).The results of clinical and echocardiographic features before and after the BPV were reviewed in 29 neonates (18+/-12 days of life). Different hemodynamic and 2-D color Doppler echocardiographic were evaluated. The BPV result was classified as favourable if no other balloon or surgical therapy was required to normalise pulmonary flow and achieve a sustained right ventricle-pulmonary artery (RV-PA) Doppler gradient below 40 mmHg. It was considered unfavourable if the neonate died, needed surgery or redilation and/or the RV-PA Doppler gradient was > or =40 mm Hg. The study developed in three phases: pre BPV immediate post BPV until the hospital discharge (14+/-11 days), and in the mid-term follow-up of between 8 and 96 months (51+/-31 months).Mortality was not registered with BPV. The RV/left ventricular systolic pressure decreased from 1.4+/-0.3 to 0.8+/-0.3 (p<0.01) as a consequence of the dilation, and the the systemic oxygen saturation increased from 85 +/-12 to 92+/-6% (p<0.01). The RV-PA Doppler gradient diminished from 86+/-18 to 28+/-16 mm Hg immediately after BPV (p<0.01) and was registered at 13+/-6 mm Hg in the follow-up (n = 24). The RV-PA junction Z value grew from -1.25+/-0.9 before valvuloplasty to -0.51 +/-0.7 at the final echocardiogram (p<0.01). No changes in the tricuspid diameter were detected between both periods of time. Five neonates obtained unsatisfactory results: 4 in the immediate post BPV (systemic-pulmonary artery shunt 2, transannular patch 2), and 1 in the mid-term follow-up (valvectomy + transannular patch). The actuarial curve reflects that 82,7% of the patients were free form reinterventions at 8 years.BPV is safe and effective to relief PVS in the neonate. The balloon promotes advantageous changes in both, pulmonary annulus and the right ventricle. In addition, the RV-PA Doppler gradient observations in the follow-up, support the expectation that the BPV is a "curative" therapy.
