Stent implantation in a central aorto-pulmonary shunt. A 5.5-week-old infant with tricuspid atresia presented with severe hypoxemia not responding to the placement of a central shunt (4 mm polytetrafluorethylene). The infant was taken to the catheterization laboratory, where an AVE stent was successfully implanted in a severe postoperative stenosis, at the pulmonary end of the anastomosis. The oxygen saturation improved significantly, however, the infant died due to renal failure. The post-mortem anatomical findings are shown.
