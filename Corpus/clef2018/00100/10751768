Diagnosis and catheter treatment of innominate artery stenosis following stage I Norwood procedure. Four infants aged 20-115 days (mean, 57.8 days) who had undergone stage I Norwood procedure for hypoplastic left heart syndrome came to early cardiac catheterization (6-112 mean, 47.3 days) following surgery because of significant arterial desaturation (pulse oximetry indicating oxygen saturations consistently in the 40%-70% range). Cardiac catheterization demonstrated a significant systolic pressure gradient between the ascending aorta and innominate artery (30-65
