Device closure of an atrial septal defect following successful balloon valvuloplasty in a neonate with critical pulmonary valve stenosis and persistent cyanosis. Persistent cyanosis after successful balloon valvuloplasty for neonatal critical pulmonary valve stenosis is often related to poor right ventricular compliance and right-to-left shunting at the atrial level. A successful catheter closure of an atrial septal defect was performed with a dramatic increase in systemic oxygen saturation alleviating the need for a surgical systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunt.
