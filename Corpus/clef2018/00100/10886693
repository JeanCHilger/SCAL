High frequency oscillatory ventilation during repair of neonatal congenital diaphragmatic hernia. We evaluated the use of high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) during congenital diaphragmatic hernia repair. After preoperative stabilization, 22 newborn infants were ventilated with HFOV during surgery. Ventilatory settings, blood gas values and oxygenation index were recorded before, during and after surgical repair. No differences were noted for these variables. No complications related to ventilation were recorded. According to the surgeon, diaphragmatic repair during HFOV is facilitated. This study confirms that CDH can be safely repaired using HFOV during anaesthesia.
