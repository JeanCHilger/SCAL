Surgical closure of patent ductus arteriosus in the premature infant with respiratory distress. During the period from February, 1971 to February, 1973, 30 premature infants underwent surgical ligation of patent ductus arteriosus. The gestational ages ranged from 25 to 36 wk (mean 30), and the birth weights ranged from 760 to 2010 g (mean 1274). The patients were divided into two groups on the basis of the indications for assisted ventilation. Group I consisted of 21 patients with severe hylanine membrane disease who required assisted ventilation during the first 2 days of life and could not be weaned off the respiratory by 10 days of age. Group II was composed of nine infants who required intermittent positive-pressure breathing after a mean age of 8 days because of repeated apneic spells secondary to uncontrollable heart failure. All infants in Group II survived the operation and left the hospital well. Fourteen of the 21 patients in Group I survived the seven deaths were all due to underlying severe pulmonary disease (bronchopulmonary dysplasia). The value of PDA ligation in premature infants with uncontrollable heart failure is demonstrated in this study
