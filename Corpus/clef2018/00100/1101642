IV. Evaluation of dichromatic earpiece densitometry in children with left-to-right shunts. Earpiece densitometry was performed in 60 infants and children with left-to-right cardiovascular shunts. The method was found to possess a high diagnostic sensitivity with respect to identification of the left-to-right shunt. Earpiece densitometry was in this respect clearly superior to conventional method using oxygen saturation figures. Quantitation of pulmonary blood flow by both densitiometric and oxygen content technique in a small number of patients indicates that the dye dilution technique gives values somewhat in excess of the Fick method. It is concluded that quantitation of the magnitude of the left-to-right shunt and pulmonary blood flow is disturbed by the fact that indicator material is recirculated before the ascending limb of the primary curve is fully inscribed.
