A case of central nervous system anomalies (agenesis of corpus callosum, colpocephaly, hydrocephalus, congenital dermal sinus) associated with congenital heart disease(double-outlet right ventricle, complete endocardial cushion defect, atrial septal defect, pulmonary arterial stenosis, patent ductus arteriosus). A case of central nervous system anomalies(agenesis of corpus callosum, colpocephaly, hydrocephalus, congenital dermal sinus) associated with congenital heart disease(double-outlet right ventricle, complete endocardial cushion defect, atrial septal defect, pulmonary arterial stenosis, patent ductus arteriosus) is reported. Female patient had been already diagnosed as hydrocephalus during pregnancy and ventricular drainage was performed soon after the delivery. Prostaglandin E 1 was also applied for heart disease, but saturation of O2 decreased to 80% on arterial blood gas analysis. Blalock-Taussig operation and ligation of ductus arteriosus was done 41 days after the delivery and ventricle-peritoneal shunt was also made for the progressive hydrocephalus on the same day. Chromosome analysis showed no abnormality. The genesis of this complicated brain and heart anomaly is discussed from the viewpoint of neural crest cell abnormality.
