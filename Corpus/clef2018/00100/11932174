Antegrade palliation for diminutive pulmonary arteries in Tetralogy of Fallot. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcome following palliative reconstruction of right ventricular outflow tract in Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) with diminutive pulmonary arteries with central and peripheral stenosis.Between 1986 and 1999 in 15 children with the diagnosis of TOF palliative reconstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract without closure of the ventricular septal defect (VSD) was performed. All patients were not suitable for an AP-Shunt because of a diminutive pulmonary vascular bed. Six patients were younger than 1 year at operation.There was one hospital death (6.7%) in a child with additional aortic valve insufficiency in multi-organ failure. Although the postoperative course was prolonged (median duration on ICU: 8 days) and complicated by congestive heart failure, clinically the 14 patients discharged improved significantly. The arterial oxygen saturation increased from 67 to 93% (P<0.001), the hemoglobin decreased from 16.1 to 13.3g/l (P=0.02) and hematocrit from 0.52 to 0.40 (P=0.06). In control angiography, the McGoon Index increased in the average from 1.01 to 1.95 (P<0.001). VSD closure was performed in 12 patients (median: 2.5 years after initial operation) with one perioperative death. A homograft had to be implanted in seven patients and a mechanical prosthesis in the right ventricular outflow tract in one. One late death occurred due to ventricular arrhythmia 12 years after antegrade palliation (11 years after corrective operation).The antegrade palliation seems to be an adequate strategy for the treatment of selected children with diminutive pulmonary arteries in TOF, who were not candidates for primary correction or an AP-Shunt.
