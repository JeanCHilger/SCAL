Assessing oxygen requirement after discharge in chronic lung disease: a survey of current practice. In order to survey current management of oxygen in children with chronic lung disease (CLD) of prematurity in the United Kingdom and Ireland, 260 questionnaires asking about criteria that were considered important when removing supplemental oxygen from a child with CLD were sent to consultant paediatricians identified as being likely to be involved in the follow-up of children with CLD. A total of 120 questionnaires were returned from 114 centres. The factors that were considered important when removal of the patient's supplemental oxygen was being considered were: the oxygen saturation level in 100% responders the respiratory rate in 62%there is an enormous variety of practice with regard to the management of supplemental oxygen for children with chronic lung disease suggesting an urgent need for research and evidence-based guidelines.
