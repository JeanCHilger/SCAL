Right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery shunt versus modified Blalock-Taussig shunt in the Norwood procedure for hypoplastic left heart syndrome - influence on early and late haemodynamic status. The aim of this study was to assess changes in early and late haemodynamic status after the Norwood procedure (NP), caused by the implementation of right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery shunt (RV-PA).A consecutive series of 68 children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome underwent NP: Group 1 (n=31) with the application of a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt and Group 2 (n=37) with RV-PA. Haemodynamic data from the early postoperative period (72 h after the operation) and cardiac catheterisation data, as well as blood tests before the hemi-Fontan procedure (HF) were analysed. Univariate (chi(2) test, Mann-Whitney's and Student's t-tests) and multiple regression analysis were carried out.In Group 1, circulatory collapse requiring resuscitation occurred in 15 (48.4%) children, within 72 h after the procedure. The resuscitation was unsuccessful in nine (29%) cases. The operative mortality (30 days) was 35%. In Group 2, two (5%) children died within the early and two (5%) within the late postoperative period. The postoperative course in the remaining children from Group 2 was uneventful. In Group 2 there was a significantly higher mean diastolic pressure after NP (P<0.05). The arterial pulse pressure after NP was significantly lower in Group 2 (P<0.05). Before HF, the application of RV-PA was associated with a lower Qp:Qs ratio (P=0.020), lower aortic pulse pressure (P=0.004) and lower aortic oxygen saturation (P=0.039).A stable haemodynamic status due to independent coronary perfusion, higher diastolic and lower pulse pressure is the most advantageous effect of RV-PA, resulting in a lower mortality and morbidity after NP. A lower Qp:Qs ratio eliminates the danger of the ventricular volume overload and ensures good conditions for the development of the pulmonary circulation before HF.
