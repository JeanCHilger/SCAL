The treatment of critical valvular stenosis of the pulmonary artery by the balloon valvuloplasty method in patients in the first 3 years of life. The work generalizes the experience of the Bakulev Institute of Cardiovascular Surgery in balloon valvuloplasty of valvular pulmonary stenosis in 58 children of the first 3 years of life: 8 were 1 to 6 months of age, 10 were 7 to 12 months of age, 18 were 13 to 24 months old, and 22 were 25 to 36 months old. Cyanosis was found in 27 of them. As the result of balloon valvuloplasty, the systolic pressure gradient between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery reduced from 114.7 +/- 12.6 to 31.4 +/- 7.2 mm Hg in children under 1 year of age, from 143 +/- 12.6 to 40.1 +/- 8.3 mm Hg in children aged from 1 to 3 years. In patients with cyanosis, saturation of arterial blood with oxygen increased to 92%. The late-term results were studied in follow-up periods of 6 to 36 months in 35 patients, by means of catheterization and angiocardiography in 15 of them. Analysis showed balloon valvuloplasty to be effective. Balloon valvuloplasty was repeated in 5 patients with critical stenosis because a hemodynamic effect was not achieved by the first dilatation.
