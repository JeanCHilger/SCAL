Auditory brainstem responses in congenital heart disease. To evaluate the effect of chronic hypoxemia on brainstem maturation, auditory brainstem responses were examined in 70 children (32 with and 38 without cyanosis) who had congenital heart disease. Ninety-one age-matched normal children served as controls. At 1-3 months of age, the I-V interpeak latencies of cyanotic infants (mean +/- S.D. 5.17 +/- 0.17 ms) were more prolonged than were those of controls (4.95 +/- 0.11 ms) and those without cyanosis (4.84 +/- 0.22 ms
