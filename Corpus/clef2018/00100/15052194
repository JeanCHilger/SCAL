Early cavopulmonary anastomosis in very young infants after the Norwood procedure: impact on oxygenation, resource utilization, and mortality. The optimal timing of second-stage palliation after Norwood operations remains undefined. Advantages of early cavopulmonary anastomosis are early elimination of volume load and shortening the high-risk interstage period. Potential disadvantages include severe cyanosis, prolonged pleural drainage and hospitalization, and excess mortality. We reviewed our recent experience to evaluate the safety of early cavopulmonary anastomosis.Eighty-five consecutive patients undergoing post-Norwood operation cavopulmonary anastomosis were divided into group I (cavopulmonary anastomosis at <4 months n = 33) and group II (cavopulmonary anastomosis at >4 monthsGroup I patients were younger than group II patients (94 +/- 21 days vs 165 +/- 44 days, respectively P <.001) and smaller (4.8 +/- 0.8 kg vs 5.8 +/- 0.9 kgEarly cavopulmonary anastomosis after the Norwood operation is safe. Younger patients are more cyanotic initially after surgery and have a longer duration of mechanical ventilation, pleural drainage, intensive care unit stay, and hospitalization.
