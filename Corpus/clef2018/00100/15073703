The value of end-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring during systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunt insertion in cyanotic children. To investigate the relationship between end-tidal carbon dioxide levels and augmentation of pulmonary blood flow achieved by insertion of systemic-pulmonary shunts.Prospective clinical study.University hospital.Nineteen cyanotic children with tetralogy of Fallot.Modified Blalock-Taussig shunt operations were performed on the left side in 14 patients and on the right side in 5 patients.End-tidal carbon dioxide tension was recorded, and an arterial blood gas sample was obtained simultaneously after thoracotomy (T0) and after completion of systemic-pulmonary shunt (T1). End-tidal carbon dioxide tension was significantly higher ( p < 0.01), and arterial to end-tidal carbon dioxide tension difference was significantly lower (p < 0.01) at T1 when compared with T0. The increase in end-tidal carbon dioxide showed a statistically significant correlation with the response of arterial oxygen saturation (r = 0.61, p < 0.01). The fall in arterial to end-tidal carbon dioxide tension difference correlated inversely with the change of oxygen saturation (r = -0.81, p < 0.0001).It is concluded that end-tidal carbon dioxide tension alterations offer an alternative intraoperative tool to monitor pulmonary blood flow during modified Blalock-Taussig shunt procedures.
