The effect of bloodless pump prime on cerebral oxygenation in paediatric patients. In paediatric patients, crystalloid prime for cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) causes further haemodilution in comparison with blood-containing prime. Thus it may affect the cerebral oxygen supply/demand balance. The purpose of the study was to compare the effect of bloodless pump prime with that of blood-containing prime on cerebral oxygenation in children.Thirty-six paediatric patients scheduled for elective repair of atrial or ventricular septal defect were enrolled. In Group C (n = 18), the CPB circuit was primed only with crystalloid. In Group B (n = 18), red blood cells were added to achieve a haematocrit (Hct) of 20% during CPB. The regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO(2)) value measured by near-infrared spectroscopy was compared between the two groups.In both groups, rSO(2) decreased below baseline at the start of CPB and during rewarming (P < 0.001, for both groups during each period). At the start of CPB, haemodilution was greater in Group C than in Group B (Hct 16.1 +/- 0.7% vs. 20.7 +/- 0.5% P < 0.01), and there was a greater reduction in rSO(2) in Group C (49.0 +/- 5.4% vs. 59.2 +/- 7.0%In paediatric patients, the haemodilution associated with crystalloid priming causes a greater reduction in rSO(2) than with blood-containing prime at the starting period of CPB and the rewarming period.
