Anaesthesia considerations for cardiac MRI in infants and small children. General anaesthesia is frequently necessary in infants and small children undergoing cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), because of the imaging techniques, MRI environment and potential need for breath-holding to facilitate imaging. Anaesthetizing paediatric patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) for cardiac MRI poses many challenges for the anaesthetist and this report reviews our experience.We retrospectively reviewed the anaesthesia and MRI records of all patients who had undergone cardiac MRI between January 2000 and October 2002.A total of 250 children with cardiac disease underwent general anaesthesia for cardiac MRI. ASA classification included class I, 2% class IIOur experience demonstrates that general anaesthesia for cardiac MRI can be provided safely in infants and small children with CHD, despite the complexity and pathophysiology of many defects, the frequent breath-holding for image acquisitions and the MRI environment.
