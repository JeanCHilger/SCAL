Pulse oximetry in children with congenital heart disease: effects of cardiopulmonary bypass and cyanosis. The objective of this prospective, observational study with consecutive sampling was to assess the reliability, bias, and precision of Nellcor N-395 (N) and Masimo SET Radical (M) pulse oximeters in children with cyanotic congenital heart disease and children with congenital heart disease recovering from cardiopulmonary bypass-assisted surgery admitted to a cardiovascular operating suite and pediatric intensive care unit at a tertiary care community hospital. Forty-six children with congenital heart disease were studied in 1 of 2 groups: (1) those recovering from cardiopulmonary bypass with a serum lactic acid > 2 mmol/L, and (2) those with co-oximetry measured saturations (SaO(2)) < 90% and no evidence of shock. Measurements of SaO(2) of whole blood were compared to simultaneous pulse oximetry saturations (SpO(2)). Data were analyzed to detect significant differences in SpO(2) readout failures between oximeters and average SpO(2) - SaO(2) +/- 1 SD for each oximeter. A total of 122 SaO(2) measurements were recorded the median SaO(2) was 83% (57 - 100%). SpO(2) failures after cardiopulmonary bypass were 41% (25/61) for N versus 10% (6/61) for M (P < .001). There was a significant difference in bias (ie, average SpO(2) - SaO(2)) and precision (+/- 1 SD) between oximeters (N, 1.1 +/- 3.3 vs M, -0.2 +/- 4.1
