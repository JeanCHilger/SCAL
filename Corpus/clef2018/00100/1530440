Rashkind atrio-septostomy in incubators and neonatal intensive care units. In 7 neonates with cyanotic heart disease, balloon atrial septostomy was performed in the neonatal intensive care unit under two-dimensional echocardiographic control. Trans-umbilical route was used with success in 6 neonates and percutaneous femoral vein in 1 neonate after failure of the trans-umbilical route. The mean transcutaneous oxygen saturation increase was 22%. No complications were observed. The average duration of the procedure was 25 minutes. Thus this technique is efficient, quick and easy to perform, allowing the procedure to be done under optimal environmental conditions in critically ill neonates.
