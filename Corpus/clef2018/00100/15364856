Early clinical results of the telemetric adjustable pulmonary artery banding FloWatch-PAB. Adjustment of pulmonary artery banding (PAB) may be a challenging procedure in complex congenital heart defects. Whatever the technique used, subsequent re-operations are frequently needed to control the pulmonary blood flow or pressures.To report the efficacy of a new telemetric adjustable PAB (FloWatch-PAB) operated with the help of an external control unit that transmits to the implant energy and commands to further narrow or release the pulmonary artery using radiofrequency waves.In a multicenter, prospective, nonrandomized, single-arm clinical investigation, 13 children (median age, 4.5 months range, 6 days to 11 yearsThis new device is safe and allows optimal adjustment of PAB in complex heart defects. In children requiring PAB, the use of this technology can obviate the need for early re-operations and appears to be a valuable option in the panel of surgical alternatives for selected infants.
