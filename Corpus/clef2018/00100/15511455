Ventricular resynchronization by multisite pacing improves myocardial performance in the postoperative single-ventricle patient. Ventricular resynchronization with multisite pacing in heart failure patients results in acute improvement of myocardial performance, but the mechanism is unknown. Our goals were to determine whether multisite pacing results in acute improvement of myocardial performance in postoperative single-ventricle patients, and to elucidate the mechanism by assessing the synchronization of regional ventricular contraction during multisite pacing using real-time three-dimensional echocardiographic imaging.Multisite pacing studies were performed in 26 single-ventricle patients (mean age, 28 months range, 7 days to 11 years) undergoing some form of single-ventricle palliation (stage I Norwood, 4With multisite pacing performed at a median postoperative day 2 (range, 0 to 9), QRS duration decreased in 24 of 26 patients (93.9 +/- 17.5 versus 71.7 +/- 10.8 ms p < 0.001)Multisite pacing improves cardiac performance after single-ventricle palliation. Real-time three-dimensional echocardiography demonstrated that multisite pacing improved the synchrony of ventricular contraction.
