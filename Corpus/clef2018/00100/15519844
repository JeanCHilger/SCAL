Use of palivizumab for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus infections in children with congenital heart disease. Recommendations from the French Paediatric Cardiac Society. Palivizumab is now authorized in France for prophylaxis of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in infants with haemodynamically significant congenital cardiac disease. A multicentre randomised trial was shown that treatment was safe and effective for such children. The therapeutic protocol is similar to that used in preterm infants and consists of five, monthly, intramuscular injections of palivizumab, at a dose of 15 mg/kg, started 2 months before the onset of epidemic season. To guide clinicians to identify children most likely to benefit from prophylaxis, the Pediatric Cardiac Group of French Cardiac Society has proposed recommendations. Prophylaxis with palivizumab is recommended in high-risk infants for respiratory complications after RSV infection: infants under I year old left to right shunt with cardiac failure, failure to thrive, pulmonary hypertension or bronchial compression
