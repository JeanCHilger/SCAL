Central cyanosis and clubbing in an 18-year-old postpartum woman presenting with a stroke. An 18-year-old woman without previously documented medical history delivered a healthy 32-week-old preterm infant. Severe bleeding occurred during week 1 postpartum secondary to ruptured vaginal condylomas. The consequent anemia was accompanied by complaints of exercise intolerance that resolved with blood transfusion. Six weeks later, the patient was brought to the emergency department of the regional medical center, where she was found to be unresponsive, with a left-sided hemiparesis and with hypoxemia that failed to correct with assisted ventilation and 100% oxygen. A cardiology consultation was obtained, which identified the patient as having central cyanosis and heretofore unappreciated marked clubbing of fingers and toes. This suggested a diagnosis of right-to-left shunting, likely at the cardiac level, together with presumptive embolic stroke, which was documented by magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography as a left pontine infarct. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography identified anomalous drainage of the inferior vena cava into the left atrium, which was confirmed by a three-dimensional computed tomographic angiogram. Corrective surgery in the form of atrial septostomy and redirection of the inferior vena cava to the right atrium was performed. The patient was subsequently discharged and is in stable condition 3 months later without effort intolerance and with normal arterial oxygen saturation on room air.
