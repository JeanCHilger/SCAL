Saturation with oxygen for ductal dependent congenital heart diseases before and after the prostaglandin therapy. Ductal dependent congenital heart diseases represent 14-20% of all congenital heart diseases. A primary goal of the treatment of these diseases is to retain ductus open until the final cardiosurgical treatment. Prostaglandins are presently the only medicaments, which have a capability to keep ductus open. By means of a retrospective study in a period from January, 2000 until December, 2002 at the Paediatric clinic of the Clinical centre of the University in Sarajevo, 14 patients (treated with prostaglandins) diagnosed with ductal dependent congenital heart diseases were analyzed. In our sample, there are 9/14 male patients (64.3%), 11/14 (78.6%) were full-term newborns, while 10/14 (71.4%) were eutrophic at birth. An average saturation increase, after the prostaglandin therapy, measured in blood from the capillaries is 29, and measured transcutanlly is 32 units. Duration of prostaglandin therapy in our study was on average 17.2 days. The most common cause of death was insufficientia cardiorespiratoria (4 out of 11), but sepsis/infection (3 out of 11) and insufficientia renalis were also common. 78.6% (11 out of 14) patients died partly because of the complexity of these diseases, but also because a cardiosurgical treatment is delayed. A goal of this study is evaluation of saturation with oxygen before and after the prostaglandin therapy.
