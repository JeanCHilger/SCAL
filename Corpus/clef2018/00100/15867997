Initial analysis of the use of the L-D-Hydro (Eato L-D-Hydro) organic tubular graft for performing the modified Blalock-Taussig procedure in congenital heart diseases with decreased pulmonary blood flow. To analyze the initial results of the use of an organic tubular graft for systemic-pulmonary anastomoses.From March 2002 to April 2003, 10 patients underwent systemic-pulmonary shunt of the modified Blalock-Taussig type, using a new type of biological graft originating from the bovine mesenteric artery treated with polyglycol, the so-called L-D-Hydro. The patients' ages ranged from 3 days to 7 years, and 60% of them were of the male sex. The diagnoses of heart disease were determined on echocardiography. All patients had clinical signs of severe hypoxia (cyanosis). The heart diseases were as follows: tetralogy of Fallot (40%), tricuspid atresia (50%), and atrioventricular septal defect (10%).One patient died due to sepsis and 9 had an immediate improvement in O2 saturation on pulse oximetry and in the partial oxygen pressure on arterial blood gas analysis. The intensive care unit length of stay ranged from 2 to 6 days. No patient had obstruction of the shunt on the immediate postoperative period or any other complication. All patients had a patent shunt on the echocardiographic studies performed in the immediate postoperative period and later, in the third postoperative month. No bleeding occurred during surgery or in the postoperative period.The tubular L-D-Hydro graft proved to be promising for performing systemic-pulmonary shunt as an alternative for the inorganic products available in the market, however, we need a greater number of implantations and late follow-up for definitive assessment.
