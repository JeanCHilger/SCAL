High flow rates during modified ultrafiltration decrease cerebral blood flow velocity and venous oxygen saturation in infants. The intracranial hemodynamic effects of modified ultrafiltration in children are unknown. We investigated the effects of different blood flow rates during modified ultrafiltration on the cerebral hemodynamics of children with weights above and below 10 kg.Thirty-one children (weights: < or = 10 kg, n = 21 > 10 kg, n = 10) undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass were studied. Middle-cerebral artery blood flow velocities and cerebral mixed venous oxygen saturations were measured before, five minutes from the beginning, and at the end of ultrafiltration. Patients were classified according to their blood flow rates during ultrafiltration in three groups: high (> or = 20 mL/kg/min), moderate (10-19 mL/kg/min), and low flow rates (< 10 mL/kg/min).During modified ultrafiltration, blood pressures and hematocrit increased (p < 0.001), but cerebral blood flow velocities and mixed venous oxygen saturations decreased (p < 0.001). A significant correlation was found between blood flow rates of ultrafiltration and the decline in mean cerebral blood flow velocity (r = - 0.48 p = 0.005) and cerebral oxygen saturation (r = - 0.49High blood flow rates through the ultrafilter during modified ultrafiltration transiently decrease the cerebral circulation in young infants compared with lower blood flow rates. These effects may be related to an increased diastolic runoff from the aorta into the ultrafiltration circuit that leads to a "stealing" effect from the intracranial circulation, which may be important in infants with dysfunctional cerebral autoregulation.
