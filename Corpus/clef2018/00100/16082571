Regression of cardiac enzyme and ventriculocoronary communication in an infant with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum after radiofrequency valvulotomy and valvuloplasty. I report on a 3-month-old infant with pulmonary atresia-intact ventricular septum and ventriculocoronary communication (VCC) who underwent percutaneous radiofrequency valvulotomy and valvuloplasty (RFVV). The patient's cardiac troponin-I, creatine kinase (CK), and myocardial fraction of (CK-MB) were elevated before RFVV and were gradually regressed to normal levels 12 days after RFVV. The VCC disappeared after RFVV. The transvalvular pressure gradients across the pulmonary valve were less than 30 mmHg in the follow-up echocardiography at 4-12 months of age. Oxygen saturation was approximately 90% in room air. Dipyridamole-thallium myocardial scintigraphy showed positive reperfusion over the apex and interventricular septum.
