Successful thoracoscopic repair of esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula in a newborn with single ventricle physiology. A neonate with VACTERL association including tricuspid atresia was scheduled for thoracoscopic esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula (EA/TEF) repair and laparoscopic gastrostomy tube placement. In addition to standard noninvasive monitoring, arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure, and cerebral oxygen saturation were monitored. Gastric distension resulting from positive pressure ventilation prevented laparoscopic gastrostomy tube placement. Thoracoscopy with a CO2 insufflation pressure of 6 mm Hg at low flow (1 L/min) was well tolerated hemodynamically despite hypercarbia and cerebral oxygen saturation was maintained. Careful monitoring and good communication were critical to the safe management of this single ventricle patient during thoracoscopic EA/TEF repair.Esophageal and tracheoesophageal fistula in conjunction with single ventricle physiology carries a significant risk of mortality. We present the anesthetic management of a neonate with unpalliated tricuspid atresia who underwent thoracoscopic tracheoesophageal fistula repair.
