Protein oxidation injury occurs during pediatric cardiopulmonary bypass. Proteins are the major effectors of biological structure and function. Oxidation-induced changes to protein structure can critically impair protein function, with important pathologic consequences. This study was undertaken to examine whether oxidation-induced changes to protein structure occur during pediatric cardiopulmonary bypass and to examine the association with postoperative outcome.Elevation of the 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine content of a protein relative to its native tyrosine content indicates structural damage due to oxidation. Protein 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine/native tyrosine ratios were measured before surgery and up to 6 hours after institution of cardiopulmonary bypass in 24 children undergoing repair of congenital heart disease, who were prospectively selected to form a cyanotic and comparable acyanotic control group. Results were correlated with perioperative variables and postoperative outcomes.Elevation of protein 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine/tyrosine ratios above baseline (0.48 mmol/mol [SD, 0.11 mmol/mol] vs 0.36 mmol/mol [SD, 0.13 mmol/mol] P = .001) occurred within 30 minutes of initiating cardiopulmonary bypass in cyanotic but not in acyanotic children and correlated inversely with preoperative arterial oxygen saturation (R = -0.52Oxidative injury to proteins occurs during pediatric cardiopulmonary bypass. Cyanotic children are most at risk, particularly those undergoing prolonged procedures, in whom elevation of the protein 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine/tyrosine ratio is associated with increased postoperative morbidity.
