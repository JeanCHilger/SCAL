Reliable atrial septostomy by stenting of the atrial septum. The aim of this report was to describe our experience with creating an interatrial communication by stenting the interatrial septum. In many forms of congenital heart disease, the presence of an appropriate interatrial shunt is critical. After the first several weeks of life, balloon atrial septostomy is not effective, and success with other methods is limited. Clinical records, echocardiograms, and catheterization data in patients who had an atrial septal stent placed between 2001 and 2004 at UCLA were reviewed. Changes in atrial pressures and systemic saturations were analyzed. Follow-up data and explant pathology were reviewed as available. Thirteen patients had stenting of the atrial septum (four restrictive, nine nonrestrictive). In patients with elevated right and left atrial pressures, there was a mean reduction of 2.4 and 7.4 mm Hg in right atrial and left atrial pressures, respectively. In patients with transposition physiology, there was a mean increase in oxygen saturation of 11.3%. Follow-up echocardiograms revealed patent stents with excellent position relative to the atrial septum. In six cases, the stents were removed during subsequent surgery and appeared endothelialized and patent. Stenting of the atrial septum is safe and effective in selected cases, allowing for a reliable, long-lasting, restrictive or nonrestrictive interatrial communication.
