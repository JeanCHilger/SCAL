Screening for duct-dependant congenital heart disease with pulse oximetry: a critical evaluation of strategies to maximize sensitivity. To evaluate the feasibility of detecting duct-dependent congenital heart disease before hospital discharge by using pulse oximetry.Case-control study.A supra-regional referral centre for paediatric cardiac surgery in Sweden.200 normal term newborns with echocardiographically normal hearts (median age 1.0 d) and 66 infants with critical congenital heart disease (CCHD median age 3 d).Pulse oximetry was performed in the right hand and one foot using a new-generation pulse oximeter (NGoxi) and a conventional-technology oximeter (CToxi).With the NGoxi, normal newborns showed a median postductal saturation of 99% (range 94-100%) intra-observer variability showed a mean difference of 0% (SD 1.3%), and inter-observer variability was 0% (SD 1.5%). The CToxi recorded a significantly greater proportion of postductal values below 95% (41% vs 1%) in the normal newborns compared with NGoxi (p<0.0001). The CCHD group showed a median postductal saturation of 90% (45-99%) with the NGoxi. Analysis of distributions suggested a screening cut-off of <95%Systematic screening for CCHD with high accuracy requires a new-generation oximeter, and comparison of saturation values from the right hand and one foot substantially improves the detection of CCHD.
