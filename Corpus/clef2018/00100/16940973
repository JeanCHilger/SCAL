Mesenteric oxyhemoglobin desaturation improves with patent ductus arteriosus ligation. Near-infrared spectroscopy was used to monitor cerebral and mesenteric regional oximetry in a preterm neonate undergoing surgical ligation of a patent ductus arteriosus. This patient initially demonstrated severe mesenteric oxyhemoglobin desaturation, which improved immediately following ductal ligation.
