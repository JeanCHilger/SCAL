Failed detection of complex congenital heart disease (including double outlet right ventricle and total anomalous pulmonary venous return) by neonatal pulse oximetry screening. We report on a newborn infant with complex congenital heart disease (CHD) featuring double outlet right ventricle and hypoplastic left ventricle who had postductal oxygen saturation well above 95% and thus eluded pulse oximetry screening for CHD.
