Percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty of stenotic standard Blalock-Taussig shunts: effect on choice of initial palliation in cyanotic congenital heart disease. To date, attempted balloon dilation of stenotic standard Blalock-Taussig shunts has been largely disappointing. It has been suggested that this may be due to the use of balloons of insufficient diameter. Balloon dilation of stenotic Blalock-Taussig shunts was attempted with use of relatively large balloons in five patients (11 to 67 months old) with cyanotic heart disease who were becoming progressively cyanotic and polycythemic (hemoglobin 17.9 +/- 1.1 g/dl) because of discrete shunt stenosis at the site of pulmonary anastomosis. Balloon diameters selected were equal to or within 1 mm of the unobstructed proximal shunt diameter. Before balloon dilation the diameter at the site of the stenosis was 2.8 +/- 0.8 mm (range 1.7 to 4) after balloon dilation it was 5.7 +/- 1.1 mm (range 4.5 to 7.5). The diameter increased in all patients (range 2.0 to 3.5 mm)
