The effect of halothane/nitrous oxide/oxygen mask induction on arterial hemoglobin saturation in cyanotic heart disease. The effect of a halothane/nitrous oxide/oxygen mask induction on arterial hemoglobin saturation (SaO2) was studied in 25 patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease. During this induction the SaO2 increased from 80% +/- 2 (mean +/- SEM) in awake patients breathing room air to 86% +/- 1 after induction of anesthesia, with an average increase of 6.8% +/- 2 (absolute) (N = 25 P < .005). Patients were retrospectively divided into two groups, A and B. Group A patients had pulmonic infundibular stenosis (PIS) (N = 13) with the potential for variable pulmonary outflow tract obstruction. These patients had awake SaO, values of 76% +/- 3 that increased significantly after induction to 86% +/- 1, with an average increase of 10% +/- 4 (absolute) (P < .01). Group B patients did not have PIS
