Diminished Blalock-Taussig shunt flow detected by cerebral oximetry. Near-infrared spectroscopy is a noninvasive optical technique used to monitor brain tissue oxygenation. Measurement of cerebral oxygenation is a more sensitive monitor of oxygen delivery to the brain than other available monitors. Prolonged cerebral desaturation is correlated with poor neurological outcomes. We report a case where the cerebral oximeter alerted us to diminished blood flow in a preexisting Blalock-Taussig (subclavian artery to pulmonary artery) shunt.
