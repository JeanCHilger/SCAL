Cerebral perfusion and oxygenation after the Norwood procedure: comparison of right ventricle-pulmonary artery conduit with modified Blalock-Taussig shunt. The proposed physiologic advantage of the modified Norwood procedure using a right ventricle-pulmonary artery conduit to supply pulmonary blood flow, compared with a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt, is reduced runoff from the systemic-to-pulmonary circulation during diastole, resulting in a higher diastolic blood pressure and improved systemic perfusion. We hypothesized that the modified Norwood procedure is associated with improved cerebral perfusion and oxygenation.Transcranial Doppler sonography and near-infrared spectroscopy were performed in neonates undergoing the Norwood procedure with either a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt (n = 14) or right ventricle-pulmonary artery conduit (n = 13).Diastolic blood pressure was significantly higher in the right ventricle-pulmonary artery group at 6 hours after bypass (46 +/- 7 vs 40 +/- 4 mm Hg P = .03), on postoperative day 1 (45 +/- 6 vs 37 +/- 5 mm HgThe higher diastolic blood pressure after the modified Norwood procedure is not associated with higher cerebral blood flow velocities or regional cerebral oxygen saturation. This may imply an equal vulnerability to the cerebral injury associated with hemodynamic instability in the early postoperative period.
