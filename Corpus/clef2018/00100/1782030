Evaluation of peripheral circulation in infants with aortic coarctation by transcutaneous pO2 measurement. Fourteen patients 6 weeks to 8 months of age with coarctation of the aorta (CA) were examined before and after correction of the anomaly. In inspiration of increasing concentrations of O2 the TavO2 was progressively delayed below CA as compared to the region above CA, which reflected latent tissue oxygen deficiency. After CA correction the TavO2 values were practically the same in both regions. Measurement of TavO2 at two points during inspiration of increased O2 concentrations (0.65) may be an objective method for confirming the existence of CA in infants.
