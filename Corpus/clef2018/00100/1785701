Anesthesia for heart catheterization in children. Comparison of 3 techniques. A study was carried out to compare the haemodynamic and respiratory effects, as well as the quality of recovery, of anaesthesia with ketamine, sodium gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GOH) and etomidate in children undergoing cardiac catheterization. Thirty children, mean age 48 +/- 35 months, ranked ASA 2 or 3 on account of congenital heart disease, were assigned to one of three groups (n = 10). They were given: in group E1, a 0.3 mg.kg-1 bolus of etomidate, followed by 0.1 mg.kg-1.min-1 for 10 minutes, and 0.026 mg.kg-1.min-1 thereafter in group G2, a 50 mg.kg-1 bolus of GOH, and in group K3, a 4 mg.kg-1 bolus of ketamine followed by a continuous infusion of 0.083 mg.kg-1.min-1. The patients breathed spontaneously. Monitoring included heart rate, systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure, pulse oximetry, and capnography. Femoral venous or arterial catheterization was performed after local anaesthesia (with no more than 2 mg.kg-1 of lidocaine). Measurements were performed before induction, and then 1, 10, 30 and 60 minutes afterwards. The quality of anaesthesia was assessed according to Steward's scale. The investigation lasted between 50 and 100 min in all three groups. There were no significant differences in haemodynamic and respiratory parameters during the investigation between the groups. Recovery was shorter and of better quality in group E1. On the opposite, 30 minutes after the end of the catheterization, all the patients in group K3 were stuporous, with 5 of them displaying involuntary movements. The patients of the other two groups reacted correctly to stimuli, but those in group G2 went back to sleep very rapidly. There were no complications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
