Neonatal patent ductus arteriosus recanalization and stenting in critical Ebstein's anomaly. A critically ill 3-day-old neonate with severe tricuspid valve Ebstein's anomaly, functional pulmonary atresia, and closed ductus arteriosus, unresponsive to prostaglandin infusion, underwent percutaneous ductal recanalization and stenting as an alternative to a surgical shunt. After local prostaglandin infusion through an end-hole catheter, the ductus was passed using a hydrophilic, high-support coronary guidewire. It was then stabilized by coronary stent implantation, after which the arterial oxygen saturation showed a sudden rise. In conclusion, ductus arteriosus recanalization and stenting can be successfully achieved within a few days after spontaneous closure as a cost-effective alternative to a surgical shunt for critical neonatal, duct-dependent Ebstein's anomaly.
