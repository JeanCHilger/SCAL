Influences on heart rate variability in spontaneously breathing preterm infants. To investigate the influence of maturational and physiological factors on heart rate variability in spontaneously breathing very preterm infants (n = 29) a multiparametric study was performed during the first 3 days of life in infants born at a gestational age below 33 weeks. Four times a day, RR-intervals, respiration curve and rate, transcutaneously measured blood gases and observed body movements were recorded while the infants were asleep. All data were stored simultaneously in a micro-computer. Non-invasively measured blood pressure and patency of the ductus arteriosus were documented as well. Four sets of short- (STV) and long term variability (LTV) indices were calculated. Both STV and LTV appeared to be significantly influenced by conceptional and postnatal age in the appropriate for gestational age infants. LTV was influenced by the behavioural state and body movements. During state coincidence 2 ('active sleep') LTV was influenced by respiratory rate and the variations in transcutaneous PO2. An effect of blood pressure or ductus patency could not be demonstrated.
