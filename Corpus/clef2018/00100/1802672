The influence of respiratory distress syndrome on heart rate variability in very preterm infants. In a multi-parametric study the influence of pathological neonatal conditions on heart rate variability was investigated in 60 preterm infants born at a gestational age below 33 weeks. Measurements were performed during the first 3 days of life. Four times a day, RR-intervals, respiration curve and rate, transcutaneously measured blood gases and observed body movements were recorded while the infants were asleep. All data were stored simultaneously in a micro-computer. Severity of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), patency of ductus arteriosus and periventricular haemorrhage were documented as well. Four sets of short- (STV) and long-term variability (LTV) indices were calculated. Severe RDS was associated with a significant decrease in LTV. The influence of RDS on LTV persisted after correction for conceptional age, postnatal age, behavioural state and variations in respiratory rate and in transcutaneous PO2. Infants with a symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus had lower LTV than controls with the same severity of RDS. STV was predominantly influenced by postnatal and conceptional age, and tended to be lower in infants with periventricular haemorrhage.
