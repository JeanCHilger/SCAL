Anatomic and hemodynamic comparisons in patients with aorta and pulmonary artery arising from the right ventricle. The anatomy and hemodynamics were compared in 59 patients with aorta and pulmonary artery origin from the right ventricle. The patients' age was from 3 months to 23.5 years. The pathophysiology of the patients' circulation was determined by many factors, the most important factors were the following: the anatomic type of the malformation, the presence or absence of pulmonary and aortic stenoses and other concurrent congenital heart malformations. The oxygen saturation of the arterial blood was associated with the direction of physiological blood flows in the right ventricle. The most "successful" anatomic and hemodynamic variants of the malformation were types A and B, in which there was no higher blood oxygen saturation in the pulmonary artery as compared to the level of blood oxygenation in the aorta despite the presence or absence of pulmonary stenosis and the site of great vessels. Type C with the inverse site of great arteries is the less "successful" anatomic and hemodynamic variant.
