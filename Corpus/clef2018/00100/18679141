Arginine vasopressin to manage hypoxemic infants after stage I palliation of single ventricle lesions. Management of patients with single ventricle physiology following stage I palliation procedures is often challenging, with optimization of the ratio of pulmonary-to-systemic blood flow as an important goal. Persistent hypoxemia may be a manifestation of elevated pulmonary vascular resistance and therefore decreased blood flow to the lungs. In such situations, the use of arginine vasopressin to increase systemic vascular resistance may be an effective strategy to improve pulmonary blood flow and maintain adequate pulmonary-to-systemic blood flow ratio. We describe three infants in whom persistent hypoxemia improved after institution of arginine vasopressin.Retrospective chart review.Twenty-four bed medical-surgical pediatric intensive care unit at a large tertiary care academic hospital.Three neonates with single ventricle physiology who received arginine vasopressin in the setting of hypoxemia following stage I palliation.Arginine vasopressin was initiated in all three patients for hypoxemia with a goal to increase systemic vascular resistance and generate a higher driving pressure for pulmonary blood flow. Twelve hours after arginine vasopressin initiation, systemic arterial saturation as determined by pulse oximetry and blood pressure increased, whereas heart rate, inotrope score, and Fio2 decreased in all three patients. Urine output was maintained and arterial lactate decreased during this time. Pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio increased in one patient in whom it could be determined.In patients with single ventricle physiology and persistent hypoxemia following stage I palliation, administration of arginine vasopressin could improve oxygenation possibly by increasing systemic vascular resistance and therefore the pulmonary blood flow.
