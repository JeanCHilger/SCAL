Interventions complementing surgery as part of multistage treatment for hypoplastic left heart syndrome: one center's experience. Interventional procedures often are used as part of multistage treatment for hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of interventions in multistage treatment of HLHS.Between 1999 and 2007, 78 interventions were performed for 58 children with HLHS at different stages of surgical treatment. Group 1, involving 30 interventions for 22 patients with postoperative pulmonary arterial stenosis, showed reduced pulmonary artery pressure and increased vessel diameter. Group 2, involving 15 interventions after the Norwood operation for 12 patients with aortic arch obstruction, showed success for 11 patients. Group 3, involving eight balloon angioplasties of narrowed Glenn anastomosis for seven patients, showed abolition of the pressure gradient between the superior vena cava and the right pulmonary artery. Group 4, involving eight interventional closures of a fenestration for eight patients after a Fontan operation, showed increased oxygen saturation for all eight patients. Group 5, involving seven interventions for six patients in whom venovenous collaterals were closed percutaneously, showed improved oxygen saturation. For Group 6, uncommon miscellaneous interventions were used to stabilize the patients' condition before the next surgical treatment.Interventional procedures play an important role during multistage treatment of HLHS. They allow for a reduction in the number of operations or stabilization of the patients' condition before the next surgical treatment.
