Prostaglandin E2 after septostomy for simple transposition. In simple transposition of the great arteries (sTGA), balloon atrial septostomy is performed prior to arterial switch to improve mixing of systemic and pulmonary circulations. Following septostomy, some patients are also given prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) until surgical repair. The aims of our study were to identify how often PGE2 is given after septostomy, the indications for starting PGE2, and the effect this has on postoperative outcome. The study was a retrospective review of infants born with sTGA between 2000 and 2005, who underwent arterial switch at Yorkhill Children's Hospital, Glasgow. Over a 5-year period, 26 infants (16 male) with sTGA underwent septostomy. There was a significant rise in mean oxygen saturation following septostomy (mean, 61.4 +/- 11.5% before, 81.5 +/- 9.4% after p < 0.05). Four of 26 (15%) did not receive PGE2 at all (group 1) and 8 of 26 (30%) received PGE2 before but not after septostomy (group 2). A total of 14 of 26 infants (54%) were given PGE2 following septostomy. This comprised 11 who received PGE2 before and after septostomy (group 3) and 3 who did not receive PGE2 prior to septostomy but did after (group 4). Groups 2 and 3 were compared directly, as they both received PGE2 before septostomy. In group 3, oxygen saturations were lower when PGE2 was started compared with saturations immediately after septostomy (45 +/- 23.6% vs. 80 +/- 10.3%
