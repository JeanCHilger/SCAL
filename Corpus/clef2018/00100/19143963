Increased serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein is related to hypoxia and brain natriuretic peptide in congenital heart disease. Studies of adults have shown a direct association between increased serum concentrations of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and chronic heart failure. Some studies have documented elevated hs-CRP in obese children and adolescents, and in patients with a history of Kawasaki disease, but there are few data on its clinical significance in congenital heart disease.Measurements of hs-CRP, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), hemoglobin, and percutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2) were done in the following 70 patients: 18 controls 11 with hypoxia (SpO2 </= 85% and BNP < 40 pg/mL)Hs-CRP in the hypoxia-BNP group was higher than in the other three groups, while in the hypoxia and the BNP groups it tended to be higher than in the controls. Although single regression analysis showed significant correlations between hs-CRP and, age, BNP, hemoglobin, and SpO2, multiple regression analysis showed that only BNP and SpO2 had a significant correlation with hs-CRP.In preoperative or postoperative congenital heart disease, patients who had hypoxia or increased BNP had a higher hs-CRP level than controls. Serum concentration of hs-CRP significantly correlated with SpO2 and plasma BNP levels, but not with age or BMI.
