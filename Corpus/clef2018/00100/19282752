Near-infrared spectroscopy as a guide for an intermittent cerebral perfusion strategy during neonatal circulatory arrest. In view of the existing controversy concerning the best perfusion technique during deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) for neonatal heart operations, we examined intraoperative rSO2 to help define an optimal interval for an intermittent antegrade cerebral perfusion (IACP) strategy. Records of patients undergoing stage 1 palliation (S1P) and repair of total anomalous pulmonary venous return (rTAPVR) from 1996 to 2004 were reviewed. A total of 16 patients were identified (11 S1P, 5 rTAPVR) with complete data and long periods of DHCA. A decline in rSO2 of either 20% or below a value of 50 was considered significant. The rSO2 for all patients was evaluated after 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes of DHCA for significant cerebral desaturation. The average rSO2 at the start of DHCA ranged from 45 to 89 for S1P and 35-86 for rTAPVR. Significant cerebral desaturation was observed in 25%-31% of patients after 5 minutes 42%-44% of patients after 10 minutes
