Value of balloon atrial septostomy in hybrid procedure for patients with complex congenital heart disease. To access the value of balloon atrial septostomy (BAS) in hybrid procedure for patients with complex congenital heart disease.From September 2000 to February 2008, ten patients with complex congenital heart disease underwent BAS before surgical radical therapy with the guidance of X-ray or transthoracic echocardiography. Eight patients (ages from 2 days to 50 days) were complete transposition of great arteries (TGA), and two patients (age was 60 days, 39 years respectively) were total anomalous of pulmonary venous connexion (TAPVC) with restrictive atrial septal defect.All procedure achieved successfully, no severe complications occurred. The average oxygen saturation of femoral arteries of patients increased from 68.3% (pre-procedure) to 81.8% (post-procedure) significantly. the status in short of oxygen of all patients improved immediately. All patients survived until a surgical radical therapy. After successful operations, nine patients discharged, only one patient died of disorder of electrolyte.BAS was a ideal palliate therapy for some cyanotic complex congenital heart disease, and can play a important role in hybrid procedure for patients with complex congenital heart disease.
