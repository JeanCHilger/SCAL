Can the Kawashima procedure be performed in younger patients? The prudence of performing early palliative cavopulmonary connection that includes superior vena cava in association with azygous-hemiazygous continuation of the inferior vena cava, Kawashima procedure (KP), has been questioned. We document our experience with KP performed at a relatively younger age than usually reported.A retrospective review of patients undergoing KP (October 2000 to April 2008) was done.Initial palliation was carried out in 13 of 15 patients. Age and weight at KP was 8.4 months (5.1 to 15.1) and 6.8 kg (4.6 to 11.0). The pre-KP catheterization showed the following: pulmonary artery pressure = 14.5 mm Hg (9 to 17) end-diastolic pressure of systemic ventricle = 8 (2 to 14)The Kawashima procedure can be safely performed at an earlier age than previously reported. The incidence of PAVMs after the KP appears to be similar to other reports where KP was performed at a later age.
