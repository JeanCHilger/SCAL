Standardized management improves outcomes after the Norwood procedure. In the past decade, many advances in the care of patients undergoing the Norwood procedure (NP) have been reported, but management remains nonstandardized at many institutions. We studied the impact of a standardized management protocol for neonates undergoing NP.Care of NP patients has been protocol-driven at our institution since 2005, with routine use of regional low flow perfusion near infrared spectroscopyHospital survival (95% vs. 70%, P= .003) and survival to S2P (85% vs. 58%, P= .006) was better in group 2. By univariate analysis, regional low flow perfusion, gastrostomy usage, and near infrared spectroscopy were associated with improved hospital and survival to S2P. In multivariable analysis, gastrostomy usage was associated with improved hospital survival (P= .027) and survival to S2P (P= .049), while our home surveillance program was a predictor of survival to S2P (P= .016).Protocol-driven management of NP patients was associated with better hospital survival and survival to S2P. Among protocol elements, gastrostomy usage was linked to both improved hospital survival and survival to S2P. Home surveillance was associated with increased survival to S2P.
