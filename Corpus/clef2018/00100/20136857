Rehabilitation program in adult congenital heart disease patients with pulmonary hypertension. It is commonly believed that physical activity may have a negative impact on pulmonary hypertension patients. The object of this study is to determine the tolerability of a directed exercise program in congenital heart disease patients with pulmonary hypertension.Eight congenital heart disease patients with pulmonary hypertension were studied and followed up during a 1-year period. Four of them were enrolled in a 3-month rehabilitation program.No significant changes in analytical data, hand and leg strength, or quality of life were seen at the end of the training program in rehabilitation and nonrehabilitation patients. However, patients in the rehabilitation group improved 6 minutes' walk test minimum hemoglobin oxygen saturation and functional class after ending the training program without having adverse events such as progression of symptoms or heart failure.Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation appears to be a safe intervention in patients with congenital heart disease and pulmonary hypertension.
