Pulmonary valvuloplasty in children with cyanotic cardiopathy. We present 5 patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease in whom a pulmonary valvuloplasty was performed as palliative therapy. The patients symptoms were hypoxemic spells, very low oxygen saturation and no weight gain. The oxygenation improved and symptoms disappeared. We believe that in properly selected patients this technique represents a good therapeutic modality.
