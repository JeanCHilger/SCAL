Venoatrial shunt-assisted cavopulmonary anastomosis. The bidirectional Glenn shunt operation is conventionally performed under cardiopulmonary bypass. Between June 2007 and September 2009, 218 consecutive patients underwent off-pump bidirectional Glenn shunt institution for single ventricle with pulmonary stenosis complex. Their mean age was 4.72 ± 1.80 years (range, 4 months to 6 years) and median weight was 10.12 kg (range, 4.1-19 kg). A temporary shunt was created between the innominate vein and the right atrium, with a 3-way connector for de-airing. Fifty-five patients had bilateral cavae. The mean internal jugular venous pressure on clamping the superior vena cava was 24.69 ± 1.81 mm Hg. Continuous end-tidal CO₂ and O₂ saturation were monitored. Adequate oxygen saturation and blood pressure were maintained by optimizing inotropics, volume, and inspired oxygen. The mean duration of ventilation was 10.17 ± 8.96 h (range, 1-73 h). There were no gross neurological complications. Postoperative pleural effusion developed in 6 (2.75%) patients, and 4 (1.83%) had nodal rhythm. Four (1.83%) patients died in the immediate postoperative period due to low cardiac output syndrome. Venoatrial shunt-assisted bidirectional Glenn shunt surgery can be performed safely by optimizing intraoperative management strategies. It is economical and avoids the deleterious effects cardiopulmonary bypass.
