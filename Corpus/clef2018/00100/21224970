Pulse oximeter accuracy and precision at five different sensor locations in infants and children with cyanotic heart disease. Since the invention of pulse oximetry by Takuo Aoyagi in the early 1970s, its use has expanded beyond the perioperative care into neonatal, paediatric and adult intensive care units (ICUs). Pulse oximetry is one of the most important advances in respiratory monitoring as its readings (SpO(2)) are used clinically as an indirect estimation of arterial oxygen saturation (SaO(2)). Sensors were placed frequently on the sole, palm, ear lobe or toes in addition to finger. On performing an extensive Medline search using the terms "accuracy of pulse oximetry" and "precision of pulse oximetry", limited data were found in congenital heart disease patients in the immediate post-corrective stage. Also, there are no reports and comparative data of the reliability and precision of pulse oximetry when readings from five different sensor locations (viz. finger, palm, toe, sole and ear) are analysed simultaneously. To fill these lacunae of knowledge, we undertook the present study in 50 infants and children with cyanotic heart disease in the immediate post-corrective stage.
