Prevalence of early postoperative arrhythmias in children with delayed open-heart surgery for severe congenital heart disease. BACKGROUND Our aim was to determine the incidence, risk factors and outcome of early postoperative arrhythmias in children with delayed treatment of severe congenital heart disease.A prospective study was conducted in 141 consecutive children with delayed referral from emerging countries, who underwent open-heart surgery.Sinus node dysfunction was noted in 5 cases. Preoperative moderate extrasystoly was common and its incidence significantly increased in the postoperative phase. Overall, 9 patients required specific antiarrhythmic therapy: 6 for sustained atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia, and 3 respectively for atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation and junctional ectopic tachycardia. Non-sustained atrioventricular and ventricular tachycardia required no therapy in respectively 6 and 1 case. Postoperative complete atrioventricular block was observed in 6 patients and remained permanent in 3. No major complications resulted from those arrhythmias. Preoperative low oxygen saturation, preoperative arrhythmias, as well as long cardiopulmonary bypass time and aortic cross-clamp time, were risk factors for early postoperative arrhythmias.Children with delayed surgery for congenital heart disease are at risk of developing early postoperative arrhythmias depending on the complexity of their disease and of its treatment. However, their prevalence (14%) is not higher than in the general population of cardiac children.
