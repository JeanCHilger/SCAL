Objective assessment of cardiac output in infants after cardiac surgery. An accurate measurement of cardiac performance in infants after cardiopulmonary bypass has long been considered to be an important part of postoperative management. To be useful in clinical decision making, such measurements should ideally be reproducible, non invasive and accurately reflect tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery. Historically, we have relied on intermittent measurements of cardiac output using indicator dilution methods and more recently, technologies that use pulse contour analysis, bio-impedance, or Doppler methodology. These all have the same shortcoming, that they provide a number that the information as to whether it provides adequate tissue perfusion. There is increasing emphasis being placed on the measurement of oxygen delivery either by mixed venous oxygen saturation and serum lactate, which are important markers of the adequacy of organ perfusion
