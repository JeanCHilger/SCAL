The use of newborn screening pulse oximetry to detect cyanotic congenital heart disease: a survey of current practice at Army, Navy, and Air Force hospitals. To determine the prevalence of newborn screening pulse oximetry (+POx) among military hospitals, including barriers to instituting protocols.An internet-based questionnaire was forwarded to the senior pediatricians at military hospitals worldwide supporting newborn deliveries.Forty seven of 53 hospitals (88%) supporting deliveries responded to the survey. Thirty percent of hospitals utilize a +POx protocol. Eight centers cited no problems with implementation. All hospitals screened at > or = 24 hours of life. The site of recording, positive values, and follow-up for positive screens varied. Cardiology consult and echocardiogram were not mandated. Most hospitals (34/47) are unable to obtain a pediatric cardiology consult without transfer. Few hospitals (9/47) utilize a telemedicine system. Seventy-five percent (24/32) of hospitals not utilizing a protocol are interested in instituting one.Though slightly less than one-third of military hospitals use a +POx, there is a greater interest in its use. More reliable consultative services and a robust telemedicine system may aid its implementation.
