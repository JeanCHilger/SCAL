New technique of off-pump atrial septostomy for complex congenital cardiac anomalies. Atrial septostomy is essential for palliation of some complex congenital cardiac anomalies, such as transposition of the great arteries and left-/right-sided atrioventricular valve stenosis or atresia. Conventionally, balloon atrial septostomy is done in neonates. Beyond the neonatal period, surgical septostomy is done using cardiopulmonary bypass and can lead to increased morbidity and mortality. We report a new technique of atrial septostomy without cardiopulmonary bypass and its follow-up.Eleven cases underwent atrial septostomy without using cardiopulmonary bypass from January 2009 to June 2010. Median age of patients was 7 months (2-12 months) and median weight was 6.3 kg (range 4.5-10 kg). Surgical septostomy was performed through the right atrial appendage with a Tubb's dilator, aided by intra-operative transesophageal echocardiography. Atrial septal defect (ASD) less than 5mm was enlarged with a Kerrison bone punch and then dilated with a Tubb's dilator. Associate procedures performed were off-pump Glenn in seven cases, pulmonary artery (PA) banding in three cases, and shunt with PA band in one case.All the restricted ASDs were successfully enlarged with adequate interatrial shunting without any gradient. Echocardiography revealed no evidence of introduction of air or particulate emboli, and no tricuspid valve injury or heart block. There was no postoperative mortality. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 18 months (median 11 months). Echocardiography showed good PA band gradient/well-functioning Glenn shunt and unobstructed ASD with good oxygen saturation.This technique demonstrates the surgical feasibility of a beating-heart atrial septostomy. It avoids the adverse effects of cardiopulmonary bypass, reduces morbidity, and has no mortality. It is safe, economical, and easily reproducible. To our knowledge, this technique has not been reported in literature so far.
