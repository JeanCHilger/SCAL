The anatomy features and surgical significance of the pulmonary circuits of pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries. To analyze the anatomy features of the pulmonary circuits in the patients with pulmonary atresia (PA) with ventricular septal defect (VSD) and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (MAPCA), and discuss the clinical significance.From April 2002 to June 2010, the anatomy features of pulmonary circuits in 33 patients with PA/VSD/MAPCA were examined and analyzed. There were 21 male and 12 female patients. The age ranged from 11 months to 29 years. The anatomic types of PA/VSD included group B for 22 cases, group C for 11 cases. Thirty-one patients of them underwent 33 operative procedures. The operations included aorta-pulmonary shunt in 8 cases, one stage unifocalization with VSD open in 2 cases, complete repair in 23 cases.Twenty-nine (87.9%) patients had native pulmonary arteries, 6 of them were normal size and 23 were hypoplastic size. Four patients (12.1%) had no native pulmonary arteries. The postoperative oxygen saturation of the patients undergone shunt and one stage unifocalization was increased to 83% to 90%. There was one early death after complete repair because of multiorgan function failure. There were 4 cases of severe low cardiac output and 3 cases of respiratory function failure. Sixteen patients after complete repair were followed up more than one year. The postoperative right ventricular pressure was 41 to 99 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa). The ejection fraction value was more than 50% in 14 patients and less than 50% in 2 patients. Two patients had medium pulmonary insufficiency.An individualized approach based on the anatomy of the pulmonary circuits permits achievement in the patients with PA/VSD/MAPCA. The surgical strategy for PA/VSD/MAPCA mainly depends on the anatomy features of native pulmonary arteries, confluent pulmonary arteries and MAPCA.
