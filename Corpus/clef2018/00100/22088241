Efficacy of arterial duct stenting in neonatal pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum. To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of arterial duct stenting in neonates with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum.Eleven neonatal pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum patients received arterial duct stenting in our hospital from December 2007 to September 2010 were involved in this study. The average age was (8.20 +/- 2.90) days (ranged from 3 to 13 days). The average weight was (3.41 +/- 0.29) kg (ranged from 3.00 to 3.88 kg). The stents were selected according to digital subtracted angiography measurements. After checking for correct position by angiography, the balloon was inflated to expand the stent to desired diameter. Oxygen saturation was monitored, echocardiography was measured and stent diameter and location were observed by chest Xray. Patients were followed up at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months post procedure.Stents were successfully implanted in all 11 patients. The preoperative peripheral oxygen saturation was (63.27 +/- 8.47)%, while increased to (82.73 +/- 5.59)% after alprostadil application and to (86.18 +/- 3.19)% after operation (all P < 0.01). After the operation, the peripheral oxygen saturation was higher than alprostadil application (P < 0.05). The intraoperative narrowest diameter of patent ductus arteriosus was (1.69 +/- 0.37) mm, the length was (16.72 +/- 2.37) mm. The internal diameter of implant stents was 4 mm, the length was (20.18 +/- 3.40) mm. After the operation, surgical B-T shunt operation was performed in one patient due to stent shift and pulse oxygen saturation decrease. One patient died post operation with unknown reason, another patient received stent balloon dilatation due to pulse oxygen saturation decrease at 4 months after the surgery. Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum surgeries were performed in 2 patients at 5 and 7 months after stent implantation.The neonatal pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum arterial stent implantation was a feasible and effective procedure and this method could be used as preferred treatment in pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum for neonates.
