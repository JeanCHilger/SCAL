Effect of balloon atrial septostomy on cerebral oxygenation in neonates with transposition of the great arteries. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of balloon atrial septostomy (BAS) on cerebral oxygenation in neonates with transposition of the great arteries (TGA).In term neonates with TGA, regional cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (r(c)SO(2)) was measured using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) for a period of 2 h, before BAS, after BAS, and 24 h after BAS. In neonates who did not require BAS on clinical grounds, r(c)SO(2) was measured within 24 h of admission and 24 h later.BAS was performed in 12 of 21 neonates. r(c)SO(2) increased from a median of 42% (before) to 48% at 2 h after BAS (P < 0.05), as did transcutaneous arterial oxygen saturation (spO(2)) (from 72% to 85%, P < 0.01). r(c)SO(2) increased further during the next 24 h (from 48% to 64%, P < 0.05), whereas spO(2) remained stable. Although beginning from a lower baseline (42 vs. 51%, P < 0.01), r(c)SO(2) was higher in neonates treated with BAS, as compared with neonates not treated with BAS, 24 h after the procedure (64 vs. 58%, P < 0.05) spO(2) was, however, similar between the two groups.BAS improves cerebral oxygen saturation in neonates with TGA. Complete recovery of cerebral oxygen saturation occurred only 24 h after BAS.
