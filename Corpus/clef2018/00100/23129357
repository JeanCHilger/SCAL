Monitoring of regional tissue oxygenation with near-infrared spectroscopy during the early postoperative course after superior cavopulmonary anastomosis. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) offers continuous non-invasive monitoring of regional tissue oxygenation. We evaluated NIRS monitoring during the postoperative course after superior cavopulmonary anastomosis in patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome and anatomically related malformations.Cerebral (cSO(2)) and somatic (sSO(2)) tissue oxygenations were recorded for 48 h and compared with routine measures of intensive care monitoring. Changes in parameters in the case of postoperative complications were evaluated.Data were obtained from 32 patients. Median age at operation was 2.9 (1.5-10.0) months and weight was 5.3 ± 1.0 kg. Postoperative complications occurred in 7 patients (pulmonary artery thrombus n = 4, pneumothorax n = 1, cardiopulmonary resuscitation n = 1 and low-cardiac output n = 1). cSO(2) was 44 ± 14% at the end of the operation and reached its minimum of 40 ± 11% 2 h later (P = 0.018). Overall, cSO(2) was depressed early after surgery and increased from a mean of 42 ± 11% during the first 4 postoperative hours to 57 ± 8% in the last 4 h of the study period (P < 0.001). The sSO(2) decreased from 77 ± 11% during the early postoperative course to 68 ± 9% within the later course (P < 0.001). The cSO(2) correlated with the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (pO(2), r = 0.364, P < 0.001), with the arterial oxygen saturation (SaO(2), r = 0.547, P < 0.001) and with the central venous oxygen saturation providing the strongest correlation (SvO(2), r = 0.686, P < 0.001). Analysis of agreement between cSO(2) and SvO(2) measurements revealed a mean bias of 0.97 with limits of agreement between 19.8 and -17.9%. Inclusion of both cSO(2) and sSO(2) into a linear regression model slightly improved the prediction of SvO(2) from NIRS values (r = 0.706, P < 0.001). The mean values of cSO(2), sSO(2), SaO(2) and SvO(2) during the early postoperative period were lower in patients with complications (cSO(2): 45 ± 9 vs 29 ± 5%, P < 0.001 sSO(2): 80 ± 11 vs 70 ± 6%, P = 0.004NIRS technology allows inferring the global oxygenation from continuous non-invasive measurements of regional tissue oxygenation. The cSO(2) is lowered in the early postoperative course. Lower cSO(2) values in the early postoperative course may be predictive of postoperative complications.
