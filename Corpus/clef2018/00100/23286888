Cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in paediatric anaesthesia. Cerebral oximetry allows continuous real-time and non-invasive monitoring of cerebral oxygen saturation (cSO(2)), by measuring oxyhaemoglobin and deoxyhaemoglobin near infrared light absorption, similarly to pulse oximetry. cSO(2) measurement predominantly reflects brain venous compartment, and is correlated with jugular venous saturation. As jugular venous saturation, cSO(2) must therefore be interpreted as a measure of balance between transport and consumption of O(2) in the brain. Cerebral oximetry should be used as a trend monitoring, because its accuracy is insufficient to be considered as reliable measure of absolute value of ScO(2). In adult, correction of intraoperative cerebral desaturation reduces hospital stay, heavy morbidity and mortality, and serious postoperative neurocognitive impairment after cardiac and major abdominal surgery. In children, the occurrence of intra- and postoperative cerebral desaturations during congenital heart surgery is associated with increased neurological morbi-mortality. Cerebral oximetry could be a useful monitoring during anaesthesia of (ex) preterm neonates, due to the risk of impaired cerebral blood flow autoregulation in these patients.
