Transcatheter right ventricular outflow tract stent implantation in a child with pentalogy of Cantrell, double outlet right ventricle, and severe pulmonary stenosis. We described a 5-week-old boy with dextrocardia, double outlet right ventricle, and severe pulmonary stenosis with pentalogy of Cantrell. There was a defect within the sternum, diaphragm, and a prominent left ventricular diverticulum. Hypercyanotic spells developed with desaturation to 50%. Two Vision coronary stents were implanted in the right ventricular outflow tract with a significant improvement in oxygen saturation to 85%. This represents the first report of transcatheter pulmonary stent implantation as a form of palliation in a child with pentalogy of Cantrell.
