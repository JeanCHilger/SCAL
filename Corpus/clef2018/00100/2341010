Continuous transcutaneous PCO2 measurement and laser spectroscopy for fetal monitoring in 3d degree atrioventricular block. Obstetrical management in case of foetal third-degree AV block has been to date mainly via primary abdominal section, the indication being partly the foetal condition and partly also unsatisfactory childbirth monitoring. The article describes a childbirth associated with AV block, monitoring being effected by continuous measurement of the transcutaneous partial carbon dioxide pressure (tcpCO2) and via laser spectroscopy. Prenatal diagnostics and indications for vaginal delivery are also described. Updated knowledge on the pathogenesis of foetal AV block is presented.
