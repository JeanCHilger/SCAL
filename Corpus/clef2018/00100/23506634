Balloon valvuloplasty through the right ventricle: another treatment of pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum. This was a study to evaluate the safety and feasibility of balloon valvuloplasty of the pulmonary valve through the right ventricle (RV) for the treatment of pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PA-IVS).Ten neonates with PA-IVS, who underwent balloon valvuloplasty of the pulmonary valve through the RV at our institution from January 2008 to May 2010, were enrolled in this study. The oxygen saturation range was 60% to 83% (median 76%). The Z-value range of the tricuspid valve annulus was -2 to 2 (median 0.15), the diameter range of the pulmonary valve annulus was 4.6 to 8.6 mm (median 7.3), and the RV systolic pressure range was 88 to 124 mm Hg (median 106.5). A guidewire was used to perforate the pulmonary valve through the RV, followed by balloon dilation of the valve. The procedure was guided by transesophageal echocardiography.The procedure was carried out successfully in all patients. The procedure time ranged from 64 to 110 minutes (median 82.5). Mechanical ventilation time ranged from 8 to 36 hours (median 11), and hospital stay ranged from 7 to 13 days (median 9). After the procedure, the median oxygen saturation increased to 89.5%, the median RV systolic pressure decreased to 45 mm Hg, and the gradient across the pulmonary valve ranged from 20 to 45 mm Hg (median 27.5). Minor complications included transient supraventricular tachycardia (n = 1), blood loss requiring transfusion (n = 2), moderate pulmonary regurgitation (n = 1), and mild pulmonary regurgitation (n = 3). There were no cases of cardiac perforation, main pulmonary artery aneurysm, or low output syndrome. Follow-up of patients ranged from 8 to 15 months (median 12.3). All patients remained clinically well.Balloon valvuloplasty of the pulmonary valve through the RV is a safe and feasible alternative to surgical valvotomy or percutaneous balloon dilation. Early results are encouraging.
