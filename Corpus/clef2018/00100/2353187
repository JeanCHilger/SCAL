Brain type creatine kinase in relation to oxygen desaturation in the blood of children with congenital heart disease. The concentration of brain type creatine kinase (CK-BB) was measured in blood from the internal jugular vein in 32 children (less than 1 year old) with congenital heart disease. In transposition of the great arteries the CK-BB levels were significantly higher than in children without cyanosis (10.1 +/- 4.1 vs. 3.0 +/- 0.5 ng/ml). A negative correlation was found for CK-BB concentration and arterial oxygen saturation (r = -0.41, p less than 0.02 for all children and r = -0.62, p less than 0.05 for those with tetralogy of Fallot). It is suggested that the increased CK-BB levels in the blood of cyanotic children reflect chronic cerebral hypoxia, which may explain other reports of reduced psycho-intellectual function in patients with cyanotic heart disease.
