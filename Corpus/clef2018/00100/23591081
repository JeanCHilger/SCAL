The influence of perinatal asphyxia on peripheral oxygenation and perfusion in neonates. Perinatal asphyxia influences peripheral oxygenation and perfusion in neonates.The aim was to investigate the influence of perinatal asphyxia on peripheral oxygenation and perfusion in neonates by using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).Prospective observational study. Neonates with gestational age >34 weeks and birth weight >2000 g without infection or congenital malformations were included. Peripheral muscle NIRS measurements in combination with venous occlusion were performed once in the first 48 h of life. Tissue oxygenation index (TOI), mixed venous oxygenation (SvO2), fractional oxygen extraction (FOE), haemoglobin flow (Hbflow), oxygen delivery (DO2) and oxygen consumption (VO2) were assessed. Furthermore arterial oxygen saturation, heart rate, blood pressure and temperatures were measured. Neonates with a UapH≤7.15 and an Apgar 5≤6 were compared to neonates with a UapH≥7.15, an Apgar 5≥7 (control group) and a UapH was correlated to NIRS parameters.8 asphyxiated neonates were compared to 30 neonates in the control group. TOI (67.7±5.5%) and DO2 (29.0±14.2 μmol/100 mL/min) were significantly lower in asphyxiated neonates compared to the controls (TOI 71.8±4.9%, p=0.045 DO2 43.9±16.9 μmol/100 mL/min, p=0.028) and FOE was significantly higher (0.33±0.05) compared to the controls (0.28±0.06, p=0.028). Furthermore significant correlations between UapH and DO2 (r=0.78, p=0.022), VO2 (r=0.80, p=0.018) and FOE (r=-0.75, p=0.034) in the asphyxiated group were found.Peripheral oxygenation and perfusion measured with NIRS are compromised in neonates with perinatal asphyxia with worsening of parameters and degree of acidosis in the umbilical cord blood.
