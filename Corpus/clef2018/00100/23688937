Diagnosis and management of life-threatening cardiac malformations in the newborn. Approximately 1-2 per 1000 newborn babies have a cardiac defect that is potentially life-threatening usually because either the systemic or the pulmonary blood flow is dependent on a patent ductus arteriosus. A significant proportion of newborns with such cardiac defects are being discharged from well-baby nurseries without a diagnosis and therefore risk circulatory collapse and death. This risk is greatest for defects with duct-dependent systemic circulation, notably aortic arch obstruction, but is also significant in transposition of the great arteries, for example. The solution to this problem, apart from improving prenatal detection rates, is to introduce effective neonatal screening including routine pulse oximetry.
