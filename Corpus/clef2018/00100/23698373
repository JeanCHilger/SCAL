Coarctation of the aorta with infracardiac total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage: a rare combination. A 7-day-old female neonate was referred to the pediatric emergency department due to cyanosis and respiratory distress. Her arterial oxygen saturation was 65%. The Coarctation of the aorta, infracardiac total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage without obstruction and pulmonary artery hypertension were diagnosed by echocardiography. Emergency corrective surgery was done without confirming the diagnosis with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or cardiac catheterization due to her poor clinical status. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was extubated after the sixth day of surgery and discharged after 14 days.
