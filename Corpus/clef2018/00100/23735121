Renal and mesenteric tissue oxygenation in preterm infants treated with oral ibuprofen. Hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a common problem in preterm infants which often causes significant morbidities. Although PDA induces alterations in various tissue perfusion, there is scarce information about the effect of oral ibuprofen on hemodynamics of regional tissues.To investigate, using near-infrared spectroscopy, the effect of oral ibuprofen on renal and mesenteric tissue oxygenation and oxygen extraction in preterm infants with a diagnosis of hemodynamically significant PDA.Fifteen infants (gestational age <32 weeks) with the diagnosis of hemodynamically significant PDA treated with oral ibuprofen were monitored for near-infrared spectroscopy - determined renal and mesenteric oxygenation. The infants with PDA were matched for gestational age, postnatal age with infants without PDA, who served as control subjects.In infants with PDA, mean arterial blood pressure was significantly lower compared with the control infants [39.3 (range:36-54) versus 51 (range:43-66) mmHg, respectively p < 0.001)]. There were no significant differences in regional oxygen saturation and fractional oxygen extraction of renal and mesenteric tissues in PDA and control infants (p > 0.05). And ibuprofen treatment did not negatively influence renal and mesenteric oxygenation and extraction in infants with PDA (p > 0.05).Renal and mesenteric tissue oxygenation and oxygen extraction were preserved in preterm infants with a diagnosis of hemodynamically significant PDA treated with oral ibuprofen.
