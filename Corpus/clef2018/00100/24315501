Newborn pulse oximetry screening to detect critical congenital heart disease. To describe current practice and clarify provider opinion in the US with regard to newborn pulse oximetry screening (NPOx) for critical congenital heart disease.An internet-based questionnaire was forwarded to general pediatricians, neonatologists, and family medicine physicians. Physicians were surveyed regarding involvement in newborn medicine, knowledge of NPOx recommendations, and opinions regarding screening. NPOx protocol specifics were also queried.Survey responses (n = 481) were received with 349 respondents involved in newborn medicine. Forty-nine percent (95% CI 44%-54%) of those involved in newborn medicine practice at a hospital with a NPOx protocol. Sixty-six percent of providers endorsed it as an effective tool, 20% required more education, 11% questioned its sensitivity, and 3% had no opinion. Sixty-five percent of providers were aware of recent state legislation mandating its use and 46% reported awareness of the addition of NPOx to the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel. Eighty-four percent of providers who practice at a hospital without a NPOx protocol were interested in its implementation. NPOx protocols varied and were not uniform with differences in time of test, location of probe, and values considered positive.NPOx has grown in its prevalence and acceptance in clinical practice, yet is far from universal in its application and design despite the recent American Academy of Pediatrics endorsement and its addition to the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel. The majority of physicians involved in newborn medicine deemed it an effective tool.
