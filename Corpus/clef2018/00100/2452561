Balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty for congenital cyanotic heart defects. Eight infants with congenital cyanotic heart defects, aged 7 days to 10 months, weighing 2.9 to 10.0 kg, underwent percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty as a palliative procedure to improve pulmonary oligemia. The indication for valvuloplasty was cyanotic heart defect not amenable to total surgical correction at the age and size at presentation but at the same time requiring palliation of pulmonary oligemia. After balloon valvuloplasty, there was an increase in the pulmonary blood flow index (1.83 +/- 0.55 to 3.14 +/- 1.38 L/min/m2 p less than 0.05), pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio (0.55 +/- 0.35 to 1.19 +/- 0.63
