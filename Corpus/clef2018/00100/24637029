Intraoperative tranexamic acid in pediatric bloodless cardiac surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical effects of intraoperative tranexamic acid administration in cardiac surgery without blood transfusion (bloodless cardiac surgery) in children.Seventy-one consecutive patients weighing less than 20 kg, who underwent bloodless cardiac surgery for simple atrial or ventricular septal defects at Kobe Children's Hospital from January 2011 to June 2013, were enrolled in this retrospective study. Tranexamic acid was administered during surgery from January 2012 (TXA group n = 31), whereas it was not administered before January 2012 (control groupThere were no significant differences in patient characteristics or preoperative data between the 2 groups. Serial changes in perioperative hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, mixed venous oxygen saturation, and regional cerebral oxygenation during cardiopulmonary bypass were significantly higher in the TXA group compared to the control group. There were significant reductions in operative time, dopamine dose, peak serum lactate level, intubation time, chest tube drainage and duration, and hospital stay in the TXA group.Intraoperative tranexamic acid administration was effective for blood conservation, and improved postoperative clinical outcomes in pediatric bloodless cardiac surgery.
