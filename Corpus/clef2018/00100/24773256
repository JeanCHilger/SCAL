Novel curved balloon catheter for dilating postoperative angled lesions associated with congenital heart disease. This study aimed to analyze the surface stress generated by a novel curved balloon and assess its efficacy for treating angular lesions associated with congenital heart disease.Obstructions at the anastomosis of aortopulmonary shunts and cavopulmonary connections may occur postoperatively. Catheter interventions are often performed for such lesions however, acute angulation may cause balloon slippage or inappropriate stress on the vessel wall.We dilated the curved balloon in a curved vessel model and measured the resultant wall stress and its distribution. Clinical evaluations were performed using this balloon in angled lesions.In the curved vessel model, curved balloons generated uniform stress on the lesser and greater curvatures (curved type, lesser/greater = 0.343 MPa/0.327 MPa P = 0.61), whereas straight balloons caused disproportionate stress (straight type, lesser/greater = 0.358 MPa/0.254 MPaAlthough further clinical evaluation is necessary, this novel curved balloon may be a reasonable alternative in angled lesions, providing better conformability and preventing excessive stress to the vessel wall adjacent to the stenosis.
