Cavopulmonary anastomosis as long-term palliation for patients with tricuspid atresia. Prior to 1970, most patients with tricuspid atresia (TA) and reduced pulmonary blood flow were palliated by means of a systemic to pulmonary artery shunt (SPAS). In Birmingham between 1967 and 1988, 19 patients with TA (aged 16 days to 23 years, mean 3.8 years) have undergone side-to-side cavopulmonary anastomosis (CPA) with preservation of pulmonary artery continuity. One had undergone a previous right Blalock-Taussig shunt and in 1 patient with left and right SVCs, bilateral CPAs were performed. Nine patients were less than 1 year old at the time of operation. There were no operative deaths. One late death occurred due to pneumonia. Immediate clinical improvement occurred in all cases. Six symptomatic patients subsequently required further surgery (mean interval between operations 8.9 years, range 4.6-14.2 years). The remaining 12 patients have recently been reviewed. Mean follow-up was 9.5 years (range 5 weeks to 21 years). Exercise tolerance remains good (9 in NY-HA Class 1 or 2) and resting transcutaneous oxygen saturations are higher (mean 85%, range 70%-89%) compared with preoperative values (P less than 0.01). In small children, CPA avoids the complications of SPAS and, in some patients, may itself achieve adequate long-term definitive palliation.
