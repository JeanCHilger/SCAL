Reevaluating reference ranges of oxygen saturation for healthy full-term neonates using pulse oximetry. We compared our clinical experience with currently available reference oxygen saturation level (SpO(2)) values from the American Academy of Pediatrics/American Heart Association (AAP/AHA) neonatal resuscitation program guidelines.We enrolled 145 healthy full-term neonates infants showing respiratory distress and those with serious congenital anomalies were excluded. SpO(2) values at every 1 minute until 10 minutes after birth were measured and recorded. Infants were classified into the cesarean section (CS) and normal spontaneous delivery (NSD) groups for evaluating differences. The 10(th) percentiles of SpO(2) at each minute were used as the lower limits of normal oxygen saturation, and these were compared with the lowest target values recommended in the AAP/AHA guidelines.Overall, 130 vigorous full-term neonates (median gestational age: 38 5/7 weeks body weight at birth: 2405-3960 g) were analyzed. The median SpO(2) were 67% and 89% at the 1(st) and 4(th) minute, respectively. On average, SpO(2) values reached >90% at the 5(th) minute. No statistical differences were noted in the SpO(2) values between the CS and NSD groups after 5 minutesThe delivery modes did not affect the SpO(2) values of full-term healthy neonates. Discrepancies in SpO(2) changes in full-term neonates not requiring resuscitation between this study and the AAP/AHA guidelines were significant. SpO(2) ranges for each time point within the first 10 minutes after birth should therefore be reevaluated locally.
