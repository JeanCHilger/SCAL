Proteinuria and clinical outcome in CHD patients. CHD patients, especially those with associated hypoxaemia, usually have some level of renal function impairment, even though they are relatively young. The aim of the study was to evaluate those clinical and analytical factors that may contribute to microalbuminuria and determine the association of 24-hour proteinuria with thrombotic events and mortality.A total of 251 CHD patients were studied and demographic characteristics, blood test, and 24-hour urinalysis were analysed.Of the patients, 221 were non-hypoxaemic, and 30 were hypoxaemic (oxygen saturation of 84.3Â±5.9%). Of the non-hypoxaemic patients, 30 (13.6%), and of the hypoxaemic patients 9 (30%), showed proteinuria (>0.15 g/24 hours) (p=0.028). Hypoxaemic CHD patients also showed higher haematocrit (%) (50.7 (34.6 72.1) versus 42.8 (34.6CHD patients with proteinuria have significantly more thrombosis and more hypoxaemia than those patients without proteinuria.
