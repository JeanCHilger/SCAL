Preterm infants who later require duct ligation show different vital signs and pH in early postnatal life. The study investigated early postnatal vital signs in very low birthweight (VLBW) infants who later developed patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). We hypothesised that the early postnatal course of vital signs and blood gas variables might differ between infants whose PDA closed spontaneously, those who responded to ibuprofen and those who later required PDA ligation.We analysed computerised records of VLBW infants born <28 weeks of gestational age, including vital signs, arterial pH values and echocardiographic data from the first postnatal days.In total, 104 infants were included in the study. In the group of infants born <26 weeks of gestational age and requiring ibuprofen for PDA (n = 34), 12 infants ultimately required surgical ligation. Infants requiring ligation showed significantly lower oxygen saturation (p = 0.019), mean blood pressure (p = 0.034) and higher heart rate fluctuation ranges (p = 0.040) in the first five postnatal days than those who responded to ibuprofen. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, lower pH values in the first 48 h predicted the subsequent requirement for ligation independent of gestational age (p = 0.004).Patients <26 weeks of gestational age requiring PDA ligation showed significant differences in the course of vital signs and pH during the first days of life.
