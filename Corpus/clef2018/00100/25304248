A comparison of retesting rates using alternative testing algorithms in the pilot implementation of critical congenital heart disease screening in Minnesota. Prior to state-wide implementation of newborn screening for critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) in Minnesota, a pilot program was completed using the protocol recommended by the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children (SACHDNC). This report compares the retesting rates for newborn screening for CCHDs using the SACHDNC protocol and four alternative algorithms used in large published CCHD screening studies. Data from the original Minnesota study were reanalyzed using the passing values from these four alternative protocols. The retesting rate for the first pulse oximeter measurement ranged from 1.1 % in the SACHDNC protocol to 9.6 % in the Ewer protocol. The SACHDNC protocol generated the lowest rate of retesting among all tested algorithms. Our data suggest that even minor modifications of CCHD screening protocol would significantly impact screening retesting rate. In addition, we provide support for including lower extremity oxygen saturations in the screening algorithm.
