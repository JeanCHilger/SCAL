Palliative Potts shunt for the treatment of children with drug-refractory pulmonary arterial hypertension: updated data from the first 24 patients. Palliative Potts shunt has been proposed in children with suprasystemic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).A retrospective multicentre study was performed to assess short- and long-term outcomes after Potts shunt.From 2003 to 2014, 24 children underwent a Potts shunt [19 surgical, median age: 7.7 years (1.5-17 years), median weight: 19.5 kg (10.2-47 kg) and 5 transcatheter, median age: 8.1 years (2.3-9.7 years), median weight: 22 kg (12.5-31 kg)] for drug-refractory PAH. For the first time in humans, we performed an unidirectional valved Potts anastomosis in a child with infrasystemic PAH on intravenous epoprostenol who experienced repeated central line infections. Severe postoperative complications occurred in 6 patients (25.0%, all from the surgical group) including 3 early deaths (12.5%) related to low cardiac output. After a median follow-up (FU) of 2.1 years (range, 3 months to 14.3 years, â‰¥8 years in 7 patients), World Health Organization (WHO) functional class was dramatically improved in the 21 survivors, all being in WHO-functional class 1 or 2 (P < 0.05) none experienced syncope during the FUPalliative Potts shunt allows prolonged survival and dramatic, long-lasting improvement in functional capacities in children with severe, drug-refractory PAH. The Potts shunt might be considered as a first surgical or interventional step in the management of children with severe, drug-refractory PAH, leaving the door open for further lung transplantation, if needed.
