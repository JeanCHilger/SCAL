Percutaneous suprasternal puncture (Radner technique) of the pulmonary artery in transposition of the great vessels. Introduction of a cardiac catheter into the pulmonary artery from the right heart is not possible in a substantial proportion of patients with transposition of the great vessels. It is necessary to obtain the pulmonary artery pressure and oxygen saturation value to evaluate the degree of pulmonary stenosis and the pulmonary vascular resistance. Twenty-three patients are described in whom this was accomplished by percutaneous suprasternal puncture. There was no mortality and there were no significant complications. The technique appears to be safe and reliable.
