Ductal closure and near-infrared spectroscopy for regional oxygenation monitoring in ductus-dependent congenital heart disease. In ductus-dependent congenital heart disease, preserving the blood flow through the ductus arteriosus (DA) is vital before surgery. We present the cases of three full-term neonates with ductus-dependent congenital heart disease for whom near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) monitoring was performed. We recorded cyclical drops in regional oxygen saturation, both cerebral and renal, that corresponded to constrictions of the DA. These findings appeared either simultaneously or previous to SpO2 drops and were corrected by prostaglandin infusion. Through these cases, we assume that cyclical constrictions of ductal cells participate in the DA closure process in its early phase.
