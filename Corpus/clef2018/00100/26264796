Implications of Using Pulse Oximetry to Screen for Critical Congenital Heart Disease in Newborns. In recent years, pulse oximetry screening for critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) in newborns has been added to the list of recommended uniform screening panels and recommended by several health care organizations. Most states use pulse oximetry to screen for CCHD. Studies have identified problems with compliance and higher failure rate at moderate altitudes than at sea level, suggesting the need for alternate algorithms. Altitude, time, health status of newborns and type of cardiac defect appear to affect results. Early detection of CCHD improves health outcomes and reduces morbidity and mortality. Barriers to screening include out-of-hospital births, cost and knowledge deficits among health care professionals.
