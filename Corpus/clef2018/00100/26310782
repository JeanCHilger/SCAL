Impact of novel balloon catheter on static balloon atrial septostomy with double balloon technique in infants with congenital heart disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of static balloon atrial septostomy (BAS) with the double balloon technique for infants. TMP PED balloon catheter, newly designed for static BAS in small children, was used in 3 infants. The balloon catheter has a low profile, short and round shoulder, and smooth deflation without slippage.Three infants (transposition of the great arteries, n=2 pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum, n=1) underwent static BAS with double balloon for restrictive interatrial communication between December 2014 and March 2015. Hemodynamic and echocardiographic assessment was done before and after the procedure. Pressure gradient between left and right atrium decreased from 6, 7 and 9 mmHg to 2, 2 and 1 mmHg, respectively. Oxygen saturation in systemic artery increased from 72, 68 and 73% to 78, 70 and 79%, respectively. Maximum defect diameter increased from 3.5, 3.0 and 3.3 mm to 6.6×5.2, 9.0×6.2 and 8.1×5.1 mm, respectively. No complication was recorded.Static BAS with double balloon technique using the novel TMP PED balloon catheter was safe and effective in producing sufficient interatrial communication for 8-20 weeks in infants. Static BAS is a promising procedure to create interatrial communication in infants.
