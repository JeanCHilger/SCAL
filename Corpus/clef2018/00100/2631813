Calculation of the pulmonary to systemic flow ratio using echo-Doppler in septal defects--correlation with oximetry. 1. local validation of a protocol of measurement of pulmonary to systemic flow ratio (QP/QS) by echo-Doppler in children with septal defects 2. to assess continuous wave Doppler efficacy mainly in those patients where peak pulmonary flow velocity was beyond the Nyquist limit of pulsed Doppler.To correlate QP/QS ratio determined by echo-Doppler with that obtained by cardiac catheterization (oximetric method) performed within 48 hours, in children with isolated septal defects.The QP/QS ratio was evaluated by pulsed and or continuous wave echo-Doppler in 50 children who were submitted within 48 hours to cardiac catheterization. All children had an intracardiac shunt (12 atrial septal defects--ASD 26 ventricular septal defects--VSD and 12 atrio ventricular septal defects--AVDS). Identical measurements were performed in a group of 20 children without cardiac malformation--control group. To test inter-observer variability, all the measurement in 31 patients were repeated by a second observer. Pulmonary and aortic flow was calculated as: Q = A x V x ET x CF where, A is the valvular orifice area (cm2), V the mean flow velocity (cm/sec), ET the ejection time (sec) and CF the cardiac frequency (cycles/min). The Doppler beam-flow direction angle in the pulmonary (P) artery and ascending aorta (Ao) was less than 20 degrees. Results were correlated with those obtained by catheterization (oximetric method).We obtained a fairly good correlation with both pulsed wave Doppler (n = 43 r = 0.88Pulsed and/or continuous wave echo-Doppler measurements are a reliable noninvasive method in evaluating QP/QS ratio in children with isolated septal defects.
