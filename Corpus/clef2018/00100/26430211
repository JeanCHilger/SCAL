Visual Diagnosis: A 7-Month-Old Girl With Cyanotic Spells. Infants can develop acquired methemoglobinemia due to intake of well water high in nitrate concentrations. Although methemoglobinemia usually presents with more severe symptoms, this diagnosis should be considered in an infant with intermittent cyanosis in the absence of underlying heart or lung disease. Well water should be avoided in infancy unless properly tested.
