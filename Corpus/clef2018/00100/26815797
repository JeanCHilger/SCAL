Timing of Newborn Pulse Oximetry Screenings for Critical Congenital Heart Defects Before Discharge. To determine if there would be positive results from a second pulse oximetry screening (POS) completed for newborns at discharge at 28 to 48 hours of age in addition to the newborn POS completed at 24 to 25 hours of age.Prospective descriptive research study.Rural, mid-Atlantic, 13-bed, level I hospital.Newborns (N = 1,002) at 35 weeks' gestation or older discharged from the newborn nursery.Registered nurses (RNs) performed POS at 24 to 25 hours of age (POS 1) and at discharge but less than 48 hours of age (POS 2). Data related to critical congenital heart defects were collected.There were no positive POS results (O2 saturation â‰¤ 90%) at POS 1 or POS 2, and no additional diagnostic tests were ordered as a result of POS. Although one full-term newborn had negative results at POS 1 and POS 2, the RN identified a murmur, and a subsequent echocardiogram was used to detect tetralogy of Fallot and pulmonary atresia. The RNs detected concerning conditions in 14 newborns that resulted in 28 additional tests, including echocardiograms (9), chest x-ray imaging (8), laboratory testing (7), electrocardiograms (3), and ultrasound imaging (1).The POS-positive result rate was 0 for newborns at POS 1 and POS 2. Therefore, our study findings supported Maryland's mandate of one POS completed within 24 to 48 hours of birth. Nurses must continue to be vigilant about assessing newborns, including screening for critical congenital heart defects and congenital heart defects.
