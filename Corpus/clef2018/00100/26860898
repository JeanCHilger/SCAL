Modification of hemi-Fontan operation for patients with functional single ventricle and anomalous pulmonary venous connection to the superior vena cava: mid-term results. Fontan candidates with mixed totally anomalous pulmonary venous connection often have postoperative pulmonary venous obstruction after cavopulmonary anastomosis. Because some pulmonary venous obstructions have no intimal hypertrophy at reoperation, we considered such pulmonary venous obstructions to be caused by 3D deformities arising from dissection or mobilization of the vessels, and hypothesized that keeping the pulmonary venous branches in a natural position could avoid such obstruction. Here, we evaluated a modified hemi-Fontan strategy consisting of minimal dissection with no division of vessels and patch separation between systemic and pulmonary venous flow.We retrospectively reviewed clinical records of infants with a functional single ventricle and supracardiac anomalous pulmonary venous connection who had undergone this procedure between 2002 and 2012.Nine infants underwent this procedure (median age, 5.6 months range 3.2-30), all with right atrial isomerism and several pulmonary venous branches directly and separately connecting to the superior vena cava. In 5 patients, all pulmonary veins drained into the superior vena cavaFor patients with functional single ventricle and anomalous pulmonary venous connections to the superior vena cava, our novel strategy of second-stage palliation could avoid postoperative pulmonary venous obstruction caused by 3D deformities, but may not eliminate pulmonary venous obstruction caused by intimal hypertrophy.
