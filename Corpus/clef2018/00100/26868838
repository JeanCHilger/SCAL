The Role of Regional Oxygen Saturation Using Near-Infrared Spectroscopy and Blood Lactate Levels as Early Predictors of Outcome After Pediatric Cardiac Surgery. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the association between regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) desaturation score (calculated by multiplying the rSO2 < 50% by time in seconds the preoperative baseline value) measured with near-infrared spectroscopy and the peak of lactate with postoperative major morbidities in pediatric patients who undergo cardiac surgery.We retrospectively analyzed the postoperative course of 152 patients between January 2012 and December 2013, for whom we continuously monitored cerebral rSO2 using near-infrared spectroscopy and serial arterial blood lactate levels for at least 48 hours.The median age at surgery was 128 days (interquartile range [IQR], 17-537 days). Thirty-nine patients had a single ventricle physiology (26%) and 135 patients (89%) required the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (median time of 130 minutes IQR, 93-172 minutes). Median postoperative peak lactate level was 3 mmol/L (IQR, 2-5.3Â mmol/L)The postoperative rSO2 desaturation score has a stronger association with major postoperative morbidities than lactate and it also provides an earlier warning sign of hemodynamic or metabolic compromise.
