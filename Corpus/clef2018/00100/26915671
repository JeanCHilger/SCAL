Feasibility of pulse oximetry screening for critical congenital heart defects in homebirths. Pulse oximetry has been shown to be a valuable additional screening test for detecting critical congenital heart defects in newborns. The feasibility of homebirth screening by the attending midwife has not been reported previously.Routine pulse oximetry screening of homebirths at 2 h of age was introduced in a UK tertiary maternity service in January 2014. The process and outcomes were evaluated.Retrospective review of the clinical record of all babies undergoing pulse oximetry screening performed following homebirths over a 16-month period was undertaken. The acceptability of screening among the home care team (n=11) was also evaluated.Ninety babies underwent routine pulse oximetry screening within 2 h following homebirth two had a positive result and were admitted to the neonatal unit with significant respiratory illness. Screening was acceptable and reassuring to midwives enabling prompt postnatal decision making and confirming normal transition without significantly increasing workload.Early pulse oximetry screening for homebirths is both feasible and acceptable.
