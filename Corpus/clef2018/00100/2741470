Pulse oximetry during shunt surgery in pediatric patients with tetralogy of fallot. Pulse oximetry is a noninvasive technique for measuring O2 saturation (SpO2) continuously. We applied pulse oximetry to 9 pediatric patients with tetralogy of Fallot during shunt surgery. Arterial oxygen tensions (PaO2) and saturations (SaO2) were also measured at the time of postinduction, just before the shunt, after the shunt and at the end of the operation. The SpO2 and SaO2 levels were identically changed in all 4 periods. The PaO2 was increased a little without statistical significance after the shunt procedure and at the end of the operation compared with the values before the shunt. However, SaO2 values increased with statistical significance after the shunt procedure and SpO2 values also showed similar increases with significance. In conclusion, continuous monitoring of SpO2 by pulse oximetry, instead of PaO2, is a very useful and reliable method to assess the improvement of perfusion after shunt, particularly in cyanotic cases.
