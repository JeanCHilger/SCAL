Pulse oximetry screening for critical congenital heart disease in planned out of hospital births and the incidence of critical congenital heart disease in the Plain community. This study evaluated pulse oximetry screening (POS) for critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) in planned out of hospital births with special attention to births in Plain communities (Amish, Mennonite and similar).Wisconsin out of hospital births in 2013 and 2014 were evaluated. Care providers were supplied with and trained in the use of pulse oximeters for CCHD screening. State records were reviewed to identify deaths and hospital admissions due to CCHD in this population.Detailed information on POS was available in 1616 planned out of hospital births. Seven hundred and ninety-nine were from the Plain community. In total, 1584 babies (98%) passed their POS, 16 infants (1%) failed and 16 (1%) were not screened. Five infants from the Plain community had CCHD and three were detected by POS.POS for CCHD can be successfully implemented outside the hospital setting and plays a particularly important role in communities with high rates of CCHD and where formal prenatal screening is uncommon.
