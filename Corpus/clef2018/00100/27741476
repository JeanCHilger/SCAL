Cerebral oxygen saturation during the first 72h after birth in infants diagnosed prenatally with congenital heart disease. Evidence suggests that hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in infants with congenital heart disease already occurs during early life. The aim of our study was, therefore, to assess the course of regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rWe included 56 infants with duct-dependent congenital heart disease. We measured arterial oxygen saturation (SpOWe observed median rWe demonstrated that, during the first three days after birth, cerebral oxygen saturation is low in infants with duct-dependent congenital heart disease. Furthermore, this study provides preoperative reference values of r
