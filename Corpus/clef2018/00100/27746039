Ductus arteriosus stenting: A promising percutaneous palliation in patients with duct-dependent pulmonary circulation. We aimed to study the feasibility and outcomes of ductal stenting in patients with duct-dependent pulmonary blood flow (PBF).Duct-dependent hypoxic patients with confluent pulmonary artery (PA) branches were enrolled for ductal stenting and followed regularly.Sixty patients, with a median age of 12 (1-1095) days and weight of 2.8 (2.2-8.9) kg, were enrolled. Median right PA (RPA) and left PA (LPA) Z-scores were -1.23 (-10.54 to 2.81) and -0.96 (-8.03 to 3.0), respectively. Mean narrowest ductal diameter was 1.73±0.57 mm and length was 12.78±3.32 mm. Sixty-four stents with mean diameter of 4.21±0.32 mm and length of 14.34±3.44 mm were deployed in 59 patients. The procedure was unsuccessful in one. Post-stenting mean oxygen saturation (SODuctal stenting is an effective palliation in patients with duct-dependent PBF. It maintains adequate SO
