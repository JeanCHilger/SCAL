The Accuracy of Noninvasive Peripheral Pulse Oximetry After Palliative Cardiac Surgery in Patients With Cyanotic Congenital Heart Disease. Children with cyanotic congenital heart disease (CCHD) live with oxyhemoglobin saturations that are typically expressed as percentages in the range of 70s and 80s. Peripheral pulse oximetry (measurement of SpOIn this study, 515 paired measurements of SpOSpOThe results raise a concern that critical hypoxemia may go undetected and untreated if pulse oximetry is relied upon as the primary means of assessing oxyhemoglobin saturation in children with CCHD. Strong preference must be given to co-oximetry of arterial samples.
