Central Venous to Arterial CO2 Difference After Cardiac Surgery in Infants and Neonates. Venous to arterial CO2 difference correlates with cardiac output in critically ill adults, but its utility in pediatric patients is unclear. We sought to correlate venous to arterial CO2 difference with other cardiac output surrogates (arteriovenous oxygen saturation difference, central venous oxygen saturation, and lactate) and investigate its capacity to predict poor outcomes associated with low cardiac output (low cardiac output syndrome) in infants after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.Retrospective chart review. Poor outcome was defined as any inotrope score greater than 15 death, cardiac arrest, extracorporeal membrane oxygenationPediatric cardiovascular ICU.One hundred thirty-nine infants less than 90 days who underwent cardiopulmonary bypass, from October 2012 to May 2015.None.Two hundred ninety-six arterial and venous blood gas pairs from admission (n = 139), 6 (n = 62), 12 (n = 73), and 24 hours (n = 22) were included in analysis. For all pairs, venous to arterial CO2 difference was moderately correlated with arteriovenous oxygen saturation difference (R = 0.53 p < 0.01) and central venous oxygen saturation (R = -0.43Venous to arterial CO2 difference is correlated with important surrogates of cardiac output, and is associated with poor outcome and mortality related to low cardiac output syndrome after cardiac surgery in infants. Prospective validation of these findings, including confirmation that venous to arterial CO2 difference can identify low cardiac output syndrome in real time, is warranted.
