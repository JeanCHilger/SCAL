Relation of Cytokine Profile to Clinical and Hemodynamic Features in Young Patients With Congenital Heart Disease and Pulmonary Hypertension. In congenital heart disease, severity of pulmonary hypertension and operability is defined by noninvasive parameters (clinical history, physical examination, and echocardiography) and sometimes, cardiac catheterization. We investigated how circulating levels of inflammatory mediators correlate with such parameters in a young pediatric population (age, 2.0 months to 3.1 years) and the effects of preoperative pulmonary vasodilator therapy with sildenafil. Cytokines were analyzed in serum using chemiluminescence signals. In the whole patient group (n = 47), interleukin 17E, a Th2 immune response mediator increased with increasing age, considered as a parameter of disease severity (R
