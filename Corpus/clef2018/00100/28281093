Maternal acceptability of pulse oximetry screening at home after home birth or very early discharge. The Netherlands has a unique perinatal healthcare system with a high rate of home births and very early discharge after delivery in hospital. Although we demonstrated that pulse oximetry (PO) screening for critical congenital heart disease is feasible in the Netherlands, it is unknown whether parents find the screening acceptable when performed in home birth setting. We assessed the acceptability of PO screening to mothers after screening in home setting. A questionnaire was sent electronically to mothers who gave birth and/or had postnatal care under supervision of a community midwife participating in the Pulse Oximetry Leiden Screening (POLS) study, a feasibility study of PO screening in the Dutch care system, performed in the Leiden region, the Netherlands. The questionnaire included questions based on satisfaction, general feelings, and perceptions of PO screening. A total of 1172/1521 (77%) mothers completed the questionnaire. Overall, mothers were happy with the performance of the test (95%), thought their baby was comfortable during the screening (90%) and did not feel stressed while the screening was performed (92%). Most mothers would recommend the test to others (93%) and considered the test important for all babies (93%).Mothers of newborns participating in the study found the PO screening acceptable when performed at home. What is Known: • Pulse oximetry screening for critical congenital heart defects is (cost)effective and acceptable to mothers when performed in hospital. What is New: • Pulse oximetry screening for critical congenital heart defects is also acceptable for mothers when the screening is performed at home.
