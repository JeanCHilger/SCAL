Public Views on Pulse Oximetry Screening for Critical Congenital Heart Disease. To understand public views on pulse oximetry screening for critical congenital heart disease.Two hundred thirteen adults read a brief vignette describing the importance of early detection of critical congenital heart disease and then answered five questions on a five-point scale of how likely or unlikely they were to support pulse oximetry screening. Responses were tabulated and analyzed using a Fisher exact test, and logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios for adjusted associations using generalized estimating equations.Almost 90% of all participants expressed support for routine pulse oximetry screening. The possibility of false positives leading to a delay in discharge, and the potential need for transfer to another facility lowered support but did not reach a statistical significance. The overall support for pulse oximetry screening was strong and consistent between different participant demographics.A large majority of participants in this study support pulse oximetry screening for the early detection of critical congenital heart disease.
