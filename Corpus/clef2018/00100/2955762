Blade auricular septostomy. We describe the first case of BAS in our country in a three months old child with transposition of the great arteries, restrictive atrial septal defect (RASD) and intact interventricular septum. When he was 15 days old, we performed a balloon atrial septostomy. He had temporal improvement and six weeks later his cyanosis increased, and a new catheterization showed systemic arterial oxygen saturation of 30%, RASD and an interatrial pressure gradient of 2.1 mmHg (left atrium LA: 3.9 and right atrium RA: 1.8). We decided to perform a new septostomy with Park's blade atrial septostomy catheter. After the procedure the interatrial pressure gradient decreased to 0.2 mmHg (RA: 4.3 and LA: 4.5), the angiography shunt and atrial pressures increased. Five months later the child is alive and the systemic arterial oxygen saturation is 51.3%. The technique, advantages and complications are described.
