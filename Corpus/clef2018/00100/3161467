Atrio-septostomy using a Rashkind catheter in complete transposition of the great arteries. Immediate and late results. Seventy one patients with complete transposition of the great arteries (TGA) who underwent balloon atrial septostomy (BAS) were studied, with the purpose to evaluate its early and late results within the first year of life. Fifty four patients were male (76,1%) and 17 female (23,9%), aged 2 days to 11 months (mean = 2,3 +/- 0,3%), being 46,5% less than 1 month old. Increase in mean aortic oxygen saturation (Ox. Sat.) after BAS was highly significant (p less than 0,001), irrespective of age and morphological features of TGA. Analysis of the group of 55 patients who underwent only BAS during the first year of life showed: mean age in the 13 non-survivors was 3,3 +/- 0,2 months increase in Ox.Sat. was highly significant in the 42 survivors and not significant in the 13 patients who died
