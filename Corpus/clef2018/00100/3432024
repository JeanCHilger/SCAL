Pulse oximetry and peroperative monitoring of low birth weight infants. In 2 very low birth weight infants, a Nelcor 100 pulse oximeter was used during surgery. These 2 babies were anesthetized during the first 3 weeks of life, one for patent ductus arteriosus ligation and the other for ventriculo-peritoneal derivation. SaO2 was maintained between 85-95% in the straight portion of hemoglobin dissociation curves, where PaO2 values are from 7 to 10 KPal. During anesthesia, FiO2 was kept between 21 and 30%. Oximeters which have a fast response time seem to be a useful tool for monitoring blood oxygenation when it is difficult to estimate normoxia but very important to avoid hypoxia or over-oxygenation.
