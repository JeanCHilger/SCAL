Hemodynamic and electrophysiologic results of the Senning procedure for transposition of the great arteries. Of 24 patients, aged 6 days to 24 months, undergoing the Senning procedure for transposition of the great arteries, 2 patients died perioperatively (8% operative mortality): 1 patient, a neonate, from sepsis and 1 patient, born prematurely and with multiple anomalies, from congestive heart failure. One patient died late postoperatively from noncardiac causes. The 21 survivors are clinically well, and in 20 complete hemodynamic and electrophysiologic data were obtained by cardiac catheterization a mean of 13 months after repair. All patients have normal systemic arterial oxygen saturation. Left ventricular function and pulmonary artery pressures are normal in all. None had pulmonary venous obstruction. Narrowing at the junction of the superior vena cava and systemic venous atrium with mean pressure differences of 5 mm Hg or more was found in 4 of the 20 patients, but was clinically manifest in only 1 patient. No abnormality of atrioventricular conduction was seen in response to programmed electrical stimulation. Sinus node dysfunction was present in 6 patients, with abnormalities of both automaticity and sinoatrial conduction. Among these 6 patients were the 5 who were younger than 5 months at operation. The Senning procedure generally results in excellent hemodynamic and electrophysiologic status in patients who undergo operation after the newborn period. Identification of sinus node dysfunction, seen in patients in whom the procedure is performed in the first few months of life, is of concern and identifies a need for close follow-up of sinus node function in this cohort of patients.
