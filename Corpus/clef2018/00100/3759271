Ventricular development and function in complete transposition: angiocardiographic evaluation. We studied 50 left ventricular cineangiograms and 41 right ventricular cineangiograms of 40 patients with usual atrial arrangement (situs solitus) together with concordant atrioventricular and discordant ventriculo-arterial connexions (complete transposition), catheterized between 1 day and 12 months of age. Our purpose was to evaluate ventricular development and function. The patients were subdivided on the basis of associated lesions into groups with intact ventricular septum with ventricular septal defect
