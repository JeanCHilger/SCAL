Combined prostaglandin therapy and ductal formalin infiltration in neonatal pulmonary oligemia. Prostaglandins and ductal formalin infiltration, singly and together, have been used in efforts to improve pulmonary flow in very ill newborn infants with right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. To evaluate the efficacy of concurrent use of prostaglandins and ductal formalin infiltration, we have reviewed our experience with 25 infants with right ventricular outflow tract obstruction and prostaglandin-ductal formalin infiltration therapy. Prostaglandin therapy was begun 22 +/- 21 hours (range 20 to 93 hours) before and was continued 20 +/- 18 hours (range 0 to 62 hours) following ductal formalin infiltration prostaglandin administration was initiated at a dose of 0.05 to 0.1 microgram/kg/min and tapered postoperatively. Clinical cyanosis was diminished in 20 of 25 infants (80%) postoperatively. Systemic arterial pH and oxygen saturation both improved following prostaglandin-ductal formalin infiltration therapy from 7.35 to 7.41 (p less than 0.001) and from 35.7 to 50.3 (p less than 0.001), respectively. Persistent ductal patency (mean 219 +/- 191 days) was observed in 17 survivors of the early postoperative period (more than 14 days). Two of five infants who died within 14 days of operation had a widely patent ductus with resultant progressive congestive heart failure. The other three infants died as a result of operative technical problems, dysrhythmias, and thrombotic ductal closure, respectively. No correlation was observed between duration of ductus patency and operatively determined size of ductus, total prostaglandin dose, or duration of prostaglandin infusion. Secondary operative intervention was delayed by 92 +/- 74 days with prostaglandin-ductal formalin infiltration therapy
