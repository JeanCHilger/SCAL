Medical manipulation of the ductus arteriosus. Prostaglandin E-1 was infused into two children with cyanotic congenital heart-disease where patency of the ductus arteriosus was necessary to maintain arterial oxygen  saturation. With each infusion oxygen saturation rose, probably as a result of dilatation of the ductus. Administration of the non-specific antagonist of prostaglandin synthesis, indomethacin, to one patient was associated with a fall in arterial saturation. The prevention of ductus closure by p.g.E-1 infusions over the first few weeks of life is a possiblility.
