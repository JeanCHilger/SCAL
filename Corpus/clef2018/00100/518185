The prosthetic (Teflon) central aortopulmonary shunt for cyanotic infants less than three weeks old: results and long-term follow-up. The expanded microporous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) 4 mm vascular prosthesis has been used to create a central aortopulmonary shunt in 20 critically ill infants less than 3 weeks old. The infants ranged from 1 to 18 days old (5.25 days), and from 1.5 to 4.0 kg (2.9 kg). Conduit length ranged from 2 to 6 cm (4 cm). Sixteen patients had atresia of the tricuspid or pulmonary valve. There were 6 early deaths (30%), only 1 of which was shunt related. The mean preoperative arterial oxygen saturation was 62% (range, 33 to 80%), and mean postoperative saturation was 87% (range, 78 to 90%). There were 5 late deaths, 1 probably caused by shunt failure. Nine long-term survivors have done well. Follow-up ranges from 1 to 36 months (18 months). Factors influencing conduit function are length, technical considerations, and pulmonary vascular resistance. Late restudy in 5 of 9 survivors confirms patency and demonstrates bidirectional pulmonary blood flow. Since PTFE shunt flow capability is fixed, the infant may require repair or a second shunt within 24 months of the initial procedure.
