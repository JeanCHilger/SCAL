Right atrial partition and right ventricular exclusion: another surgical approach for complex cyanotic congenital heart disease. A 5-year-old child with asplenia, situs inversus, single ventricle, common atrium, severe subvalvular pulmonary stenosis, 1-transposition of the great arteries, and absent inferior vena cava presented with severe limitation (resting arterial saturation 74 per cent). At operation, the systemic venous atrium was partitioned with a Dacron baffle, so that hepatic venous and coronary sinus blood was enabled to drain with the pulmonary venous blood into the single ventricle and aorta. The superior portion of this atrium was anastomosed to the divided main pulmonary artery, so that most of the systemic venous blood was allowed to flow directly to the lungs. Intraoperative hemodynamic studies revealed a pulmonary artery pressure of 12/9 mm. Hg and a superior vena caval flow that was 88 per cent of the ascending aortic blood flow. Follow-up catheterization studies revealed an intact partition, no anastomotic gradient, superior vena cava pressure of 20 mm. Hg, arterial saturation of 84 per cent, and excellent flow of contrast from superior vena cava to atrium to pulmonary artery. Exercise tolerance was markedly improved, and chronic fluid retention was not observed. This operation offers a new alternative for long-term palliation of complex lesions amenable to exclusion of the right ventricle, such as single or common ventricle with unreconstructable anomalies of the atrioventricular valves.
