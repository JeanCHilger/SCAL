E-type prostaglandins: a new emergency therapy for certain cyanotic congenital heart malformations. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) has been used to maintain patency of the ductus arteriosus in four neonates with cyanotic congenital heart disease due to obstructive right heart malformations. PGE2 was infused prior to surgery, and in three patients, during surgery until a satisfactory aorto-pulmonary shunt was established. PGE2 produced consistently an immediate and persistent rise in arterial oxygen saturation, which could be ascribed to dilation of the ductus arteriosus. No major side effects occurred, except for pyrexia in two infants. All patients recovered well from surgery. We propose this treatment as preparation for surgery in any infant with congenital heart defects and ductus-dependent pulmonary blood flow. The same treatment may be useful preoperatively in patients with aortic interruption who also depend on continued patency of the ductus for blood supply to the lower half of the body.
