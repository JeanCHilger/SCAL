Clinical manifestations of dynamic left ventricular outflow tract stenosis in infants with d-transposition of the great arteries with intact ventricular septum. Four infants with d-transposition of the great arteries and intact ventricular septum who manifested early clinical symptoms and deterioration due to dynamic left ventricular outflow stenosis are presented. All four had an anatomically adequate atrial septal defect, made at the initial balloon atrial septostomy, that was later confirmed intraoperatively. Two infants continued to have a low arterial oxygen saturation level because of inadequate interatrial mixing, and one of these had severe persistent cyanosis and was treated with the Mustard operation at age 4 days. The other two infants subsequently presented with hypercyanotic spells at age 3 months. All four infants had features of dynamic left ventricular outflow stenosis on hemodynamic, angiocardiographic and echocardiographic studies. The left ventricular outflow pressure gradient was shown to increase after administration of isoproterenol in one infant, and relief of a cyanotic spell with reduction of left ventricular systolic pressure was achieved in another after intravenous administration of propranolol. The Mustard operation relieved symptoms in all infants. The effect of left ventricular outflow tract stenosis on the mechanisms responsible for interatrial mixing in d-transposition of the great arteries with intact ventricular septum is discussed.
