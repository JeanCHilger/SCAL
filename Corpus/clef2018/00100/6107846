Neurological complications in children with congenital cyanotic heart disease (author's transl). Figures of incidence and risk factors of neurological complications (NC) endangering children with cyanotic congenital heart disease (CCHD) are very different. We examined 308 children with CCHD over an 8 years' period finding 39 cases (= 12,7) of NC. There were 5 hypoxic attacks and 3 brain abscesses. In 31 patients a cerebro-vascular accident was proven or probable. 56% of NC occured during the first year of life, most frequently in children with simple TGA. Mortality was not influenced by NC. Children without NC, surviving the first year of life represent the control group for comparison of the following hematologic parameters: erythrocytes, hematocrit, MCHC, hemoglobin, O2-saturation, platelets count. Only the last two were significantly lower in patients with NC, but no parameter allows to predict NC. The hypothesis of hypochromic, microcytic anemia as essential pathogenetic factor for cerebro-vascular accidents has no base in our material.
