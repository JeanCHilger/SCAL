Palliation of cyanotic congenital heart disease in infancy with E-type prostaglandins. Prostaglandin-E (PGE) infusions have been used in an attempt to increase ductal patency in 11 infants aged one to 99 days with cyanotic heart disease. PGE1 was used in nine infants and PGE2 in two. Five patients had pulmonary atresia, four extreme pulmonary stenosis, one Ebstein's anomaly and one simple transposition of the great arteries. All but the oldest infant showed a satisfactory increase in oxygen saturation (average 36%) attributed to dilatation of the ductus. The failure in one infant may have been due largely to hypoplasia of the left pulmonary artery. The only important side effect was apnea in one infant receiving PGE2. The efficacy of this form of treatment is confirmed in infants dependent on ductal patency for survival. PGE is an important asset in saving the lives of neonates requiring an aorticopulmonary shunt operation. The recommended starting dose is 0.1 mug/kg/min of PGE1 given by constant infusion.
