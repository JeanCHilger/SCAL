Importance of mixed venous oxygen saturation in the care of critically ill patients. The relation between mixed venous oxygen saturation and cardiac index was determined in 11 children who underwent surgical treatment for congenital heart disease. The correlation between these two variables was found to be reliable (r = 0.78, P = 0.001). The simple determination of mixed venous oxygen saturation performance, particularly when sophisticated equipment for measuring cardiac output is not available.
