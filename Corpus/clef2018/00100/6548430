An automated algorithm for radionuclide angiocardiographic quantitation of circulatory shunting. Circulatory shunting may be quantitated by analysis of time-activity curves obtained from radionuclide angiocardiography. A new automated algorithm for performing this analysis is proposed. The algorithm uses mathematical deconvolution techniques to increase the temporal separation of the components of this curve and thereby improves the accuracy of the analysis. The stability of the algorithm to random data errors was assessed by experiments on simulated time-activity curves degraded with pseudorandom noise. Excellent performance was obtained on a set of test problems previously used in the literature. The algorithm was used to quantitate left-to-right shunting in patients undergoing radionuclide angiocardiography during cardiac catheterization. A strong correlation (r = 0.96) was found between pulmonary to systemic flow ratios (Qp:Qs) obtained using the algorithm on radionuclide angiocardiographic data and Qp:Qs values obtained by oximetry at cardiac catheterization.
