Duration of circulatory arrest does influence the psychological development of children after cardiac operation in early life. Published works on intelligence quotient (IQ) and development following the use of profound hypothermia and circulatory arrest (TCA) to repair congenital heart defects in infants and young children suggest that little or no psychomotor impairment results. IQ scores derived from cognitive, memory, perceptual, quantitative, and verbal tests (McCarthy scale of the children's abilities, mean score 100, SD 16) were measured in 31 patients 5 years following operations performed with TCA between 1972 and 1976. These patients were compared with three control groups: (1) 19 patients with similar defects but operated upon using moderate hypothermia and continuous cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) (2) 16 children who were the siblings of the TCA patients
