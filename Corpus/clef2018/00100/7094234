Long-term results after atrial repair of transposition of the great arteries in early infancy. Fifty-two patients younger than age 100 days who had an intact interventricular septum or a small ventricular septal defect underwent atrial repair of d-transposition of the great arteries (d-TGA). No patient died. To assess long-term results, we evaluated all 36 patients who had been followed for at least 1.5 years (mean 2.7 years) after surgery. The physical findings, chest roentgenograms, ECGs and echocardiograms were reviewed. Catheterization was done 6-60 months (mean 15 months) after surgery in 28 patients. Growth was normal in all but three patients. Neurologic development was abnormal in six patients (delayed speech in one patient, learning disability in three patients and preoperative cerebral infarction in two patients). The ECG showed sinus rhythm in 24 patients, minor abnormalities in nine and major dysrhythmias in three. Catheterization showed a normal cardiac index in all 28 patients. No intracardiac shunt was detected in 19 of 24 patients in whom complete oximetry data were available. One patient required reoperation for persistent atrial shunt and subsequent pacemaker placement. Two patients required baffle revision for symptoms related to superior vena caval obstruction. Right ventricular end-diastolic pressure was less than 15 mm Hg in all of 18 patients evaluated. We conclude that atrial repair of d-TGA in early infancy can be performed with a low mortality rate and a low incidence of late complications.
