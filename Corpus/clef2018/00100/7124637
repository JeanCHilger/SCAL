Early assessment of hemodynamic status after repair of tetralogy of Fallot: a comparison of 24 hour (intensive care unit) and 1 year postoperative data in 98 patients. Hemodynamic data obtained in the intensive care unit, immediately after repair of tetralogy of Fallot, were compared with measurements obtained at 1 year postoperative catheterization in 98 infants and children. Eight of 12 patients who had pulmonary artery oxygen saturation of 80% or greater in the intensive care unit had a pulmonary to systemic flow ratio greater than 1.5 at catheterization all 79 patients who had a pulmonary artery oxygen saturation of ess than 80% in the intensive care unit had a pulmonary to systemic flow ratio of 1.5 or less at catheterization. Five of six patients who had a right ventricular outflow tract pressure gradient greater than 40 mm Hg in the intensive care unit had a gradient greater than 40 mm Hg at catheterization
