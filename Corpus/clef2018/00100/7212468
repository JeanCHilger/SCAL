Total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage. Nine case reports (author's transl). Total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage is one of the cardiac malformations requiring early surgical correction. In our series of nine cases, 89% were under three months of age and none above six months. Clinically, two types were present: without obstruction and with obstruction to the pulmonary venous flow. In the non obstructive group, all had mild cyanosis, heart failure, cardiomegaly and systolic murmur. In the obstructive group, they had severe cyanosis, heart failure, small heart and pulmonary fields with a "ground glass" or mottled appearance on chest X-ray due to hypertension and edema. The second heart found was split in both groups. An increased right sided O2 saturation and pulmonary hypertension are due to the total anomalous pulmonary venous connection to the right atrium. Right atrium pressures were superior than left atrium pressures in two patients, requiring atrioseptostomy in one patient. Total surgical correction was performed in three patients, with one patient surviving this patient is well one year after operation. It is noteworthy in our series the early symptomatology. Symptoms begun at birth in 77% of the cases. It was striking as well the absence of cases with drainage to the right atrium or the coronary sinus.
