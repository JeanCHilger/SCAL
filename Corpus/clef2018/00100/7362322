Long-term results of shunt procedures for tricuspid atresia. One hundred forty-eight infants and children with tricuspid atresia treated by one or more operations during a 31-year period were reviewed to indicate the long-term results of shunt procedures. In general, the Potts shunt was used most frequently in small infants while the Blalock anastomosis was preferred for children older than 3 to 6 months. The Glenn anastomosis appears to be a good secondary shunt but its use depends on specific anatomical features and the possibility of doing a Fontan procedure in the future. The duration of effective palliation for each shunt has been examined actuarilly by life-table analysis. It is essential that shunts not only maintain adequate oxygen saturation but also preserve the patency, size, and shape of the pulmonary arteries and normal pulmonary vascular resistance.
