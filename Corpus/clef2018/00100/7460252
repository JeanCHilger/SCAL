Oral prostaglandin E2 in ductus-dependent pulmonary circulation. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was administered orally, in doses of 12-65 microgram/kg at intervals of 1-4 hours, to 12 neonates in whom the pulmonary circulation depended on patency of the ductus arteriosus. After an oral dose, both oxygen saturation (SaO2) and plasma PGE2 concentration increased consistently within 15-30 minutes, reaching values comparable to those during i.v. infusions. Treatment continued for 5 days to 4 months. In eight infants, PGE2 withdrawal resulted in a decrease of SaO2, from a mean of 75 +/- 7% to 57 +/- 10% (+/- SD). The ductus remained responsive for long periods--in four infants, for over 3 months. Consequently, surgery could be delayed until the infants and their pulmonary arteries had grown. Side effects during oral therapy were similar to those during i.v. infusion but were less severe in this series. The effectiveness and simplicity of oral PGE2 administration have advantages over i.v. administration, especially for long-term treatment.
