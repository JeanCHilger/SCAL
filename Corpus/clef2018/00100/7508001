Balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty for infants with severe tetralogy of Fallot. Balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty was performed in 3 infants with severe tetralogy of Fallot at days 24, 54 and 86 because of progressive hypoxemia. In two patients, the balloon catheter (4 cm long, 5-8 mm diameter) could not pass through the pulmonary valve. This necessitated a smaller balloon and required a two-step procedure. Initially, a coronary artery balloon (2 cm long, 3.5 mm diameter) was used. Following balloon valvuloplasty, arterial oxygen saturation increased from 63 to 83% in case 1, from 69 to 85% in case 2 and 63 to 86% in case 3. Immediate postvalvuloplasty right ventricular cineangiography revealed that the maximal opening diameter of the pulmonary valve leaflets increased from 1-2 mm to 3-4 mm in cases 1 and 3, and from 2-3 mm to 4-5 mm in case 2. No significant complications occurred. Echocardiographic follow-up data showed that the diameter of the right ventricular outflow tract and pulmonary arteries increased with age. The present results show that the pulmonary valvuloplasty is an effective procedure for relief of pulmonary valve stenosis in tetralogy of Fallot and to improve oxygenation and growth of the pulmonary arteries and right ventricular outflow tract without the need of an immediate aortopulmonary shunt.
