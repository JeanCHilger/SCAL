Usefulness of intermittent monitoring of mixed venous oxygen saturation after stage I palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Most deaths after stage I palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome have occurred within the first 24 hours after surgery. Efforts to improve 1-day survival should therefore have significant impact on improving overall survival. Early death has most often been attributed to low cardiac output and abnormalities of pulmonary to systemic flow ratio (Qp/Qs). Thirteen infants underwent stage I palliation and had a catheter inserted in the high superior vena cava (SVC) for intermittent measurement of SVC oxygen saturation. Calculation of Qp/Qs was achieved using SVC saturation as a mixed venous oxygen saturation, and estimating pulmonary venous oxygen saturation. Eleven patients survived, and 2 patients died within the first 24 hours. Abnormalities in Qp/Qs were noted in 12 of 13 patients after operation. In 10 of these 12 patients, there was a high Qp/Qs, which has been associated with poor outcome. High Qp/Qs was noted even in patients with acceptable arterial oxygen saturations (< 85%). SVC saturation increased in all survivors during the first 24 hours, and was associated with a decrease in Qp/Qs. Measurement of SVC oxygen saturation appears to be a valuable adjuvant in the postoperative management of infants after stage I palliation of hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Major abnormalities in Qp/Qs can be detected even with acceptable arterial saturations. With this information, early ventilator/pharmaceutical adjustments can be made which may improve stage I survival.
