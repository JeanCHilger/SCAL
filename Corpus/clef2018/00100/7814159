Clinical profile and natural history of Ebstein's anomaly of tricuspid valve. There were 63 patients of Ebstein's anomaly of tricuspid valve encountered from 1976 to 1991 28 (44.4%) were male and 35 (55.6%) female. Their age at presentation ranged from 3 months to 51 years. Five (7.9%) patients were asymptomatic, 48 (76.2%) had class II-III exertional dyspnoea, palpitation or both. Thirty patients (47.6%) had cyanosis. Electrocardiogram showed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in two, chronic atrial fibrillation in four (6.3%), paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia in seven, atrial or ventricular ectopic beats in five (7.9%), 2:1 atrioventricular block in one (1.6%), complete atrioventricular block in two (3.2%) and type B WPW syndrome in nine patients (14.3%). Chest X-ray showed diminished vascularity in 22 (34.9%). Diagnosis was established by cardiac catheterization and or echocardiography. Atrialized right ventricular chamber was demonstrated in 51 (80.9%) by angiography and in 40 (63.5%) by electrophysiology. Patients were followed up for 1-172 months. Seventeen patients (26.9%) required surgery. Three patients (4.8%) died during medical follow-up, and five (7.9%) died following surgery. Survival probability for 46 medical patients was 88.9% at 172 months. Factors affecting survival were pulmonary blood flow, cyanosis, clubbing and systemic arterial oxygen saturation.
