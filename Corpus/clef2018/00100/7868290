Doppler imaging of an inadvertent anastomosis of modified Blalock-Taussig shunt to the right upper pulmonary vein. In a newborn infant with a complex congenital heart disease, a right modified Blalock-Taussig anastomosis was created because of the pulmonary atresia. A 4-mm Gore-Tex tube was inadvertently connected to the upper right pulmonary vein. Clinical signs of an arteriovenous fistula with no improvement in oxygen saturation were noticed immediately after surgery. This complication was confirmed by colour Doppler examination and angiography. Reanastomosis of the tube to the right pulmonary artery was then performed.
