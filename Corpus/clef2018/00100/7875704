Blade and balloon atrial septostomy for creation of an adequate interatrial communication. During a 7 year period from 1984 to 1991, 100 infants underwent either balloon atrial septostomy (BAS) (n = 92) or blade septostomy (BLS) (n = 8). The indication was complete transposition of the great arteries in all the patients. The mean age in the BAS group was 1.8 +/- 1.5 months while that in the infants requiring BLS due to a thick septum was 3.03 +/- 2.29 months. The degree of improvement in arterial oxygen saturation in both groups was satisfactory -27.16 +/- 14.06% in the BAS group vs 23.5 +/- 12.18% in the BLS group. There were no procedure related deaths in the BLS group, through only monoplane fluoroscopy was used in 6/8 patients. Three patients however died following balloon septostomy. We conclude that BLS is a safe and effective alternative to surgical septostomy when performed with due care. Two dimensional echocardiography during BAS enhances the speed and safety of the procedure and helps to identify patients who may require BLS due to a thick interatrial septum.
