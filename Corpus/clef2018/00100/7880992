Oxygen consumption following pediatric cardiac surgery. Metabolic responses during recovery from cardiac operations for various congenital heart defects were studied in 30 mechanically ventilated pediatric patients in two groups: infants 1 year or less (group I) and children more than 1 year old (group II). Oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide production (VCO2) were measured using a pediatric metabolic monitor intermittently after induction of anesthesia, after skin closure, 2 to 4 hours postoperatively, and on the first postoperative morning in the pediatric intensive care unit. Energy expenditure and respiratory quotient were determined from respiratory gas measurements. Rectal and skin temperatures and hemodynamic variables were recorded at the same time. VO2 increased during rewarming 2 to 4 hours after the operation by 12 +/- 15% in group I and by 24 +/- 19% in group II, while rectal temperature increased by 2.0 +/- 1.2 degrees C and 1.8 +/- 1.4 degrees C, respectively. No further increase in VO2 occurred until the first postoperative morning. A hypermetabolic response was not seen in all cases despite marked thermal changes. High-dose fentanyl anesthesia partly explains the low responses. On the other hand, low cardiac output may also compromise oxygen supply. Sixty-three percent of infants were treated for cardiac failure before surgery and 75% needed inotropic support immediately after the operation. Low central venous oxyhemoglobin saturation values (ScvO2 < 60%) were observed during rewarming, indicating an increase in oxygen extraction secondary to an increased oxygen demand in the brain during recovery from anesthesia, and a low cardiac output or delayed restoration of cerebral blood flow after CPB and deep hypothermia.
