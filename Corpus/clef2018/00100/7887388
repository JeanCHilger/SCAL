Comparison of four Doppler echocardiographic methods for calculating pulmonary-to-systemic shunt flow ratios in patients with ventricular septal defect. Several methods currently exist for quantifying pulmonary (Qp) and systemic (Qs) shunt flow using Doppler echocardiography, although none is widely utilized. In this study, 39 patients (age 2 months to 12 years, mean 2.1 years) underwent an echocardiographic examination within 1 month of Qp:Qs shunt flow determination by oximetry at catheterization. Qp:Qs was determined by 4 methods that utilized: (1) velocity time integrals and luminal areas to estimate volume flow of the pulmonary artery and aorta (2) the square of the ratios of pulmonary artery to aorta, multiplied by the ratio of pulmonary to aortic peak flow velocities
