The effect of different types of anesthetic respirators on oxygenation and ventilation in infants during short-term anesthesia. A study using transcutaneous PO2 and PCO2 monitoring. Monitoring of ventilation in infants is difficult and often not very reliable. In this study, transcutaneous measurement of blood gas tensions was used to investigate the influence of four different modes of ventilation on oxygenation and ventilation in anaesthetized infants. METHODS. In a randomised study, transcutaneously measured PO2 (tc-PO2) and PCO2 (tcPCO2) tensions were continuously registered in 42 ASA class I and II infants between 3 and 24 weeks of age undergoing minor surgical procedures (inguinal hernia repair). Two breathing systems combined with different modes of ventilation were evaluated: manual ventilation with Kuhn's T-piece system and face mask (group A n = 11) or endotracheal tube (group B
