Doppler echocardiography assessment of hemodynamic values and additional heart defects in atrial septal defects. Due to the rapid progress in (Doppler-) echocardiography "one must question whether cardiac catheterisation remains a necessary prelude to cardiac surgery in atrial septal defects" (8). Although the estimation of the magnitude of the intracardiac shunt and the anatomical size of the defect ist possible by (Doppler-) echocardiography there remains the problem of associated disorders (e.g. anomalies of the pulmonary venous connection) which may not be detected by transthoracic echocardiography. In 25 children submitted to cardiac catheterisation studies in the period between 1990 and 1992, the anatomical size of an atrial septal defect was measured echocardiographically. The haemodynamic parameters Qp/Qs and Rp/Rs were employed to calculate the so-called effective resistance of the defect (Rd/Rs), which was derived from an electrical analogue and represents the ratio of the resistance of the defect (Rd) to the systemic vascular resistance (Rs). The echocardiographically measured anatomical size (expressed as the ratio of the area of the defect to the cross-sectional area of the ascending aorta) was related to the effective resistance of the defect. A significant (non-linear) correlation was found between Rd/Rs and the anatomical size of defect. Based on these data we developed a nomogram describing the relationship of the size of the defect to the haemodynamic parameters (Qp/Qs and Rp/Rs). If the data of a patient do not comply with this nomogram there is strong evidence of an additional cardiovascular malformation, necessitating further evaluation. A second cohort of four patients with associated defects (partial and total anomalous pulmonary venous connection and a corresponding sinus venosus defect) was clearly identified by the nomogram method.
