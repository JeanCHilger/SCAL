Balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty for double outlet right ventricle with valvular pulmonary stenosis. A male neonate presented with cyanosis. Echocardiograms showed a double outlet right ventricle, an absent outlet septum, a subaortic ventricular septal defect and valvular pulmonary stenosis. Balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty was performed at 19 days of age, resulting in an immediate increase of the systemic arterial oxygen saturation from 67 to 87%. As far as could be found, this is the first report of a patient with a double outlet right ventricle without the outlet septum who was clinically observed and underwent balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty.
