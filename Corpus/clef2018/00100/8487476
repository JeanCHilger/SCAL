Accuracy of measurements of Kontrol 7840, Nellcor N200 and Radiometer OX13 pulse oximeters in infants and young children. Comparative validation studies of pulse oximeters from different manufacturers have predominantly been performed in adult patients. However, due to differences in the patient-sensor interface, the results from those studies may not be transferable to the paediatric population. We therefore performed 123 simultaneous measurements (37 patients) of transcutaneous O2-saturation (StcO2) from 3 pulse oximeters and compared these with the arterial O2-saturation (SaO2) from a co-oximeter (Radiometer OSM 3). The median age of the 37 patients at the time of study was 2.0 months (range 1 day-5 years), their weight 4.7 kg (0.8-15.0 kg). The mean difference between StcO2 and SaO2 was -0.6% (SD 5.2%) for the Kontron 7840 pulse oximeter, -0.9% (SD 2.3%) for the Nellcor N200, and -1.2% (SD 3.5%) for the Radiometer OXI3 pulse oximeter. The corresponding 95% intervals were -7.4(-) + 9.6%, -5.7(-) + 4.3% and -7.0(-) + 6.3% for the Kontron, Nellcor and Radiometer instrument, respectively. These results demonstrate that neither of the 3 instruments systematically under- or overestimated SaO2. However, there were differences in precision, particularly in the low range of SaO2.
