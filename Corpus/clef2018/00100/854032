Propranolol in Fallot's tetralogy: hemodynamic investigations and their clinical use (author's transl). During heart catheization in 32 non-selected patients with Fallot's Tetralogy the reaction of O2-saturation, right-to-left-shunt and of cineangiocardiography to 0.2 mg/kg propranolol i.v. was tested. Nine of 32 patients reacted favourably to propranolol. Of these 6 were put on a long term-medication of 2 to 3 mg/kg propranolol orally. Only 1 patient did not respond satisfatorily. The effect of propranolol and hemodynamic results are compared with the literature and discussed. In Fallot's Tetralogy propranolol medication without previous testing ist not recommended: without previously established exact diagnosis it can be dangerous even.
