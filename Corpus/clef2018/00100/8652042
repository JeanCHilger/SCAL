Nitric oxide in therapy of pulmonary hypertension after correction of congenital single atrium. We report on a 19-month-old boy with congenital single atrium. Cardiac catheterization preceding the surgical repair revealed an elevated pulmonary artery pressure of 60/15 mmHg (mean pressure 40 mmHg). Pulmonary flow was 8.4 l/min.m2 and systemic flow was 5.5 l/min.m2. Pulmonary arteriolar resistance was elevated to 4.2 U.m2 with 64% left-right shunt and 25% right-left shunt. Arterial O2-saturation varied around 90%. After surgical repair (insertion of a Goretex patch), the patient required mechanical ventilation with 100% oxygen for adequate oxygenation. Cardiac catheterization was repeated on the first postoperative day. No residual shunts were found. The pulmonary artery pressure was 66/40 mmHg (mean pressure 50 mmHg), systemic arterial pressure was 85/62 mmHg (mean pressure 68 mmHg). Cardiac index was 2.8 l/min.m2, pulmonary vascular resistance was 12 U.m2. After administration of prostacyclin a significant decrease of pulmonary artery pressure was observed, but without changing the ratio between pulmonary and systemic pressure. The AaDO2 varied between 400 and 580 mmHg and the oxygenation-index (PaO2/FiO2) was less than 1.0. In this situation, an attempt with inhaled nitric oxide (NO) was performed. After adding 20 ppm NO to the inspired gas, the AaDO2 decreased significantly from 580 to 270 mmHg and the oxygenation-index (OI) rose from 0.9 to 1.5. The inspired fraction of oxygen could be reduced quickly to 60%. During the next days, the concentration of NO was reduced stepwise to 1 ppm. Finally, the AaDO2 was within the normal range (25-65 mmHg) and the OI rose to a level about 4.0. The FiO2 could be reduced to 30% and nitric oxide therapy could be stopped and the child could be extubated.
