Neurological and electroencephalographic changes in newborns treated with prostaglandins E1 and E2. Six newborns with obstructive right heart lesions were examined neurologically and electroencephalographically during treatment with prostaglandin (PG) E1 or E2 given to maintain patency of the ductus arteriosus and to increase pulmonary blood flow. PG was administered intravenously or intraarterially in the aortic isthmus proximal to the ductus arteriosus. Besides a rise in arterial oxygen saturation, all patients had some sign of central nervous system involvement. The electroencephalogram showed minor changes suggestive of sedation. In addition, three patients in whom PG  was given intravenously presented various combinations of neurological abnormalities ("myoclonic jerks", apnoeic spells, hiccup) of subcortical origin. Side-effects subsided after stopping the treatment and posed no problem in the management of the patients. These findings confirm the usefulness and safety of the PG therapy and indicate that the intraaortic route of administration is preferable.
