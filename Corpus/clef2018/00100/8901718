Pharmacological control of pulmonary blood flow with inhaled nitric oxide after the fenestrated Fontan operation. A transient increase in pulmonary vascular resistance can result in hemodynamic compromise after a Fontan operation. An interatrial fenestration is designed to maintain cardiac output in these circumstances but may result in severe hypoxemia and a vicious circle due to hypoxemia induced pulmonary vasoconstriction. Our aim was to determine whether inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), a selective pulmonary vasodilator, could be used to reduce pulmonary vascular resistance in desaturated patients (SaO2 < or = 85%) after a fenestrated Fontan operation.Responses to iNO (20 ppm for 15 min) were assessed in 10 consecutive children with SaO2 < or = 85% and compared with 5 with SaO2 > 85% after a fenestrated Fontan operation. Exposure to iNO resulted in a significant increase in SaO2 (from 64 +/- 5% to 82 +/- 2%, P < .01) and reduction in transpulmonary gradient (TPG) (from 12.2 +/- 1 [SEM] to 9.6 +/- 1.1, P < .01) in patients with baseline SaO2 < or = 85%. Baseline saturation was a predictor of response to iNO, with a greater response in those with lower saturations (r = -.86, P < .01). In contrast, no significant effects were noted in PaO2 or TPG (from 122 +/- 46 mm Hg and 8 +/- 1.8 to 123 +/- 43 mm Hg and 7 +/- 1.2, respectively) in patients with baseline SaO2 > 85%.iNO improved both oxygenation and TPG in desaturated patients after the fenestrated Fontan operation, possibly by counteracting hypoxemia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction. A trial of iNO should be considered in clinically unstable desaturated patients after the fenestrated Fontan operation.
