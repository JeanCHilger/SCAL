Bidirectional Glenn shunt: a step in the right direction. Bidirectional Glenn (BDG) shunt was carried out in 14 patients (age range 1.5-22 years mean 9.3 years) for a variety of congenital cyanotic heart diseases with decreased pulmonary blood flow. Postoperative cardiac catheterisation was carried out in 10 patients including successful balloon angioplasty of the shunt and LPA in one patient. There was a significant improvement in oxygen saturation and a drop in haematocrit level at follow-up. Doppler echocardiography studies in 13 patients revealed functioning shunts in all cases with low velocity continuous flow. Thus BDG is a useful palliative procedure and could be undertaken as the first stage of total cavopulmonary connection in high-risk Fontan groups where biventricular repair is not feasible.
