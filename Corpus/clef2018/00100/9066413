Monitoring systemic venous oxygen saturations in the hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Although progress has been made in treating hypoplastic left heart syndrome, improvements in perioperative care may further decrease mortality. We present a case in which continuous monitoring of systemic venous oxygen saturation allowed stabilization and successful management of a critically ill infant. Systemic venous oxygen saturation may provide a more accurate representation of a child's clinical status, allowing more rapid intervention and better outcomes.
