Surgical relief of airway obstruction from a double aortic arch associated with corrected transposition of the great arteries, pulmonary atresia and bilateral patent ductus arteriosus in a neonate. A rare 20-day-old male with double aortic arch, corrected transposition of the great arteries (cTGA), pulmonary atresia and bilateral patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) was transported to our institute because of severe respiratory dysfunction and cyanosis. The patient had been already intubated and ventilated on respirator. A echocardiography and cine-angiography demonstrated that the both sides aortic arch had almost identical sizes, originating common carotid arteries and subclavian arteries and PDAs respectively, and the descending aorta located on the left side of the mid-line. At the first surgery, the distal of the right aortic arch was divided just proximal to the descending aorta after complete tissue dissection around the arch. The divided right sided aortic arch was mobilized from posterior to anterior aspect of the bronchus. Then the right subclavian artery was divided and an original Blalock-Taussig shunt was employed. The right sided PDA was ligated. After the first surgery, respiratory dysfunction lasted for weeks mainly because of the PGE1 dependent left sided PDA. At the second surgery, left sided modified Blalock-Taussig shunt was constructed and the left sided PDA was divided. These procedures resulted in stable respiratory status and oxygen saturation. The patient was extubated three days later and now in satisfactory clinical condition.
