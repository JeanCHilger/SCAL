Percutaneous treatment of stenosed major aortopulmonary collaterals with balloon dilatation and stenting: what can be achieved? The natural history of major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (MAPCAs) in patients with pulmonary atresia and ventricular septal defect (PA-VSD) is frequently complicated by progressive stenosis, leading to pulmonary hypoperfusion and debilitating hypoxaemia.To evaluate balloon dilatation and stenting for relief of stenoses and improvement of pulmonary flow in patients with PA-VSD.Retrospective analysis of all patients where dilatation of MAPCA stenoses was attempted.Twelve patients with stenotic MAPCAs.Dilatation was attempted in 25 stenoses. Vessels were stented if elastic recoil was noticed (n = 3), in the presence of long segment stenosis (n = 4) or marked tortuosity (n = 1).Diameter of stenoses before and after dilatation as well as arterial oxygen saturation data. Patients proceeding to surgical therapy.Two stenosed MAPCAs could not be crossed by a catheter. Four lesions were non-dilatable despite the use of high inflation pressures (18 atm). Six stenoses could be completely dilatated using angioplasty only in five, only partial dilatation was obtainedPulmonary blood flow can be improved using balloon angioplasty or stents in patients with stenotic MAPCA however, 17% of the lesions were not dilatable. Procedures are generally safe, but carry a small risk of vasospasm, dissection, occlusion or aneurysm formation.
