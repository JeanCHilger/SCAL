Closed Brock operation for an infant case of double outlet right ventricle with pulmonary atresia. One-month-old boy with double outlet right ventricle and pulmonary atresia was referred to us for surgical treatment. As he had a membranous obstruction of the pulmonary artery we chose closed Brock operation as an initial procedure. A 6.5 mm in diameter of Trocar was used to open the atretic valve. Postoperative course was uneventful and his oxygen saturation was maintained satisfactory. At the age of one year and nine months he underwent corrective surgery. The pulmonary valve was widely opened enough to perform the right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction with valvotomy and outflow patch. The boy got well and was followed in the outpatient clinic. Double outlet right ventricle with membranous pulmonary atresia is a rare combination and closed Brock operation is shown to be one of the most effective procedure for this type of anomaly.
