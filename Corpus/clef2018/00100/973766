Cardiac performance and oxygen consumption during intracardiac operations in children. Cardiac performance and oxygen consumption in 30 patients undergoing surgical treatment for congenital cardiac disease were determined from intraoperative measurements. Arterial pressure, cardiac index, mean left ventricular hydraulic output power, pulmonary artery oxygen saturation were obtained at average mean left atrial pressures of 8.1 and 15.2 cm H2O after cardiopulmonary bypass in 20 patients. These same variables were measured at an average pulmonary artery saturation of 65 and 75% in 30 patients. A composite of measurements of cardiac performance was desirable to guide precise patient care intraoperatively, especially if myocardial function was compromised. It is suggested that left atrial pressure be maintained at a level that results in a pulmonary artery saturation greater than 65%.
