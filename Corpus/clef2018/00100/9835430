Stepwise interventional approach in a neonate with pulmonary valve atresia and intact ventricular septum. In neonates with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum the aims of therapy are maintenance of pulmonary blood flow and right ventricular decompression in order to achieve right ventricular support of the pulmonary circulation. Recent developments in interventional heart catheterization with pulmonary radiofrequency-assisted balloon valvuloplasty and ductal stent implantation offer an alternative to the classical surgical approach. We report on a neonate with membranous pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum, in whom a large interatrial right-to-left shunt via the foramen ovale persisted after radiofrequency-assisted pulmonary balloon valvuloplasty on the 2nd day of life. The interatrial shunt prevented adequate right ventricular filling and antegrade pulmonary perfusion leading to severe cyanosis (transcutaneous oxygen saturation 40%). In order to increase pulmonary blood flow and raise left atrial pressure, the arterial duct was stented. After ductal stenting, prostaglandin was discontinued and the transcutaneous oxygen saturation remained stable around 89%. At follow up after 7 weeks the foramen ovale had decreased in size and only a small left-to-right shunt was present, documenting the effectiveness of this approach.Based on the present case we propose a stepwise interventional approach for the neonate with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum. If cyanosis persists after isolated pulmonary valvuloplasty despite adequate right ventricular function, ductal stent implantation can reduce interatrial shunting and thus improve oxygen saturation.
