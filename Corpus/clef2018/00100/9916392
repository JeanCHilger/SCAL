Transcatheter laser-assisted balloon valvulotomy as primary treatment in newborn with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum. We report our initial experience and the first case in Thailand in successfully performing transcatheter laser perforation of membranous pulmonary valve and subsequent balloon dilations of the valve in a 14-day-old baby with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum. After the procedure, right ventricular angiograms revealed anterograde flow across the pulmonary valve. There was no major complication. Doppler echocardiography one week later demonstrated a pressure gradient across the pulmonary valve of 30 mmHg and right ventricular systolic pressure of 60 mmHg. Her peripheral oxygen saturation improved from 70's immediately after the procedure to 92-97 per cent at one-month after the procedure.
