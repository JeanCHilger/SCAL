Pancreatic function and the danger of the occurrence of acute pancreatitis during the use of early enteral tube feeding after an operation on the bile ducts. The amylase and lipase activity dynamics was studied in experiment on 43 dogs using the method of loading with polysubstrate eatable mixtures while the jaundice simulation after a bile passage restoration. The amylase and lipase amplitude and yield increase as an answer to food introduction in the animals with the obturating jaundice simulation and after a bile diversion operation conduction was established. The fact that such possible dangerous complication as an acute pancreatitis did not occur witnesses the security of enteral probe nutrition.
