Hepatic lesion in experimental acute pancreatitis. Influence of pancreatic enzyme storage reduction. Acute Pancreatitis (AP) is known to produce morphologic and functional changes in liver. Administration of low doses of caerulein significant decreases the content of pancreatic enzymes, leading to reduced mortality of animals submitted to AP. The present study was designed to assess the effect of acute reduction of pancreatic enzymatic content in the hepatic mitochondrial function. Wistar male rats, submitted to AP by injection of Na thaurocholate into the pancreatic duct, with and without previous i.v. injection of 0.133 microgram Kg-1h-1 of caerulein for three hours, were divided in four groups: Group I: No caerulein infusion and AP Group II: Previous caerulein infusion and with AP
