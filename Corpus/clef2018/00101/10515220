Immunoreactive trypsinogen levels in pediatric patients with intestinal failure awaiting intestinal transplantation. The aim of this study was to evaluate pancreatic function in total parenteral nutrition (TPN)-dependent children with permanent intestinal failure by measuring immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) levels. Between 1992 and 1996, 105 pediatric patients with permanent intestinal failure were referred to the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh for small intestinal transplant evaluation. Serum samples were available from 55 of them. Ten suffered from intestinal pseudo-obstruction or microvillus inclusion disease, while 45 had short bowel syndrome (SBS). IRT levels were significantly higher (p < 0.001) in SBS patients (89.4 +/- 9.2 ng mL) compared to controls (43.4 +/- 5.6 ng/ nL) without liver, gastrointestinal, or kidney disease. IRT levels did not correlate with liver injury, length of bowel, or the cause of SBS. Five of 20 patients who underwent intestinal transplantation developed pancreatitis during a median post-operative follow up 15.4 months later. IRT levels failed to predict who would develop pancreatitis post-transplant. The data suggest that elevated plasma IRT levels are common among children with intestinal failure, but fail to identify patients at risk for pancreatitis post-transplant.
