Reliable screening for acute pancreatitis with rapid urine trypsinogen-2 test strip. This study was designed to evaluate the validity of a new rapid urinary trypsinogen-2 test strip (Actim Pancreatitis) for detection of acute pancreatitis in patients with acute abdominal pain.A total of 525 consecutive patients presenting with abdominal pain at two emergency units was included prospectively and tested with the Actim Pancreatitis test strip. Urine trypsinogen-2 concentrations were also determined by a quantitative method. The diagnosis and assessment of severity of acute pancreatitis was based on raised serum and urinary amylase levels, clinical features and findings on dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography.In 45 patients the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis could be established. The Actim Pancreatitis test strip result was positive in 43 of them resulting in a sensitivity of 96 per cent. Thirty-seven false-positive Actim Pancreatitis test strips were obtained in patients with non-pancreatic abdominal pain resulting in a specificity of 92 per cent. Nine patients with severe acute pancreatitis were all detected by the dipstick.A negative Actim Pancreatitis strip result excludes acute pancreatitis with high probability. Positive results indicate the need for further evaluation, i.e. other enzyme measurements and/or radiological examinations. The test is easy and rapid to perform, unequivocal in its interpretation and can be used in healthcare units lacking laboratory facilities.
