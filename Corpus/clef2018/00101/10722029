Contrast-enhanced dynamic computed tomography does not aggravate the clinical severity of patients with severe acute pancreatitis: reevaluation of the effect of intravenous contrast medium on the severity of acute pancreatitis. Contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) is useful in demonstrating pancreatitis necrosis, but the administration of contrast medium in animal models with acute pancreatitis may worsen the severity.The use of contrast-enhanced CT in clinical patients with acute pancreatitis may actually aggravate the severity of the disease.A randomized prospective study.Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.Twenty patients with severe acute pancreatitis were randomly divided into 2 groups. Those in group A (n = 10) underwent a CT examination with a contrast-enhanced medium, and those in group B (n = 10) underwent a CT examination without a contrast-enhanced medium.The patients' serum amylase, lipase, C-reactive protein, leukocyte, glutamicoxaloacetic transaminase, creatinine, calcium, and phosphate levels were serially checked before the CT examination and at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours after the examination was performed. The biochemical data between the 2 groups were compared. The morbidity, length of stay, and mortality were also compared.There were no significant changes in the level of pancreatic enzymes, C-reactive proteins, and leukocytes and in the biochemical data of either group before or after the CT examination. The difference in the previously examined values between the 2 groups was also not significant. There was also no difference in the morbidity, length of hospital stay, and mortality between the 2 groups.Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT does not aggravate the severity of clinical patients with severe acute pancreatitis.
