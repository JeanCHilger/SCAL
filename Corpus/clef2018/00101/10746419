Acute pancreatitis associated with temporal lobectomy and intractable seizure. We present a rare case of acute pancreatitis associated with temporal lobectomy due to intractable seizure in a 23-year-old man. The patient underwent elective right temporal lobectomy and hippocampectomy. Severe upper abdominal pain occurred just 10 hours after surgery. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was based on the elevation of serum amylase and lipase levels, and the findings of abdominal computerized tomography. Other possible causative factors of acute pancreatitis including alcohol, biliary tract stone, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercalcemia, hyperparathyroidism, biliary dysmotility and autoimmune disease were excluded by a series of examinations. The possibility of drug-induced pancreatitis was very low in this patient. The patient was discharged after supportive treatment. No recurrence of seizure or abdominal pain was noted in the three months after discharge. Acute abdominal pain after brain surgery deserves clinical evaluation for acute pancreatitis.
