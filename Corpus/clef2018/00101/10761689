Recovery of exocrine pancreas six months following pancreatitis induction with L-arginine in streptozotocin-diabetic rats. The aim of the present work was to investigate the laboratory and morphologic alterations in the pancreas 6 months after pancreatitis induction with L-arginine (Arg) in normal and streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic rats. The amylase content of the pancreas was significantly decreased in the Arg-treated groups vs. the control group. No significant changes were observed in the DNA, soluble protein and lipase contents of the pancreas. In the STZ-treated groups, the serum glucose level was significantly elevated, whereas the serum immunoreactive insulin (IRI) level was significantly decreased vs. the control group. In these treated groups, the amylase content of the pancreas was also significantly decreased, but that of trypsinogen was significantly elevated vs. the control group. Histologic sections revealed periductal fibroses, adipose tissue and tubular complexes in the Arg-treated rats, but centroacinar hyperplasia was not observed in these groups. No alterations were observed on histological examination in the diabetic rats vs. normal rats 6 months following pancreatitis induction. In conclusion, a major restitution of the pancreatic enzyme content, but moderate histologic alterations were detected 6 months following pancreatitis induction with Arg. The diabetic state appeared to shift the normal pancreatic enzyme content (decreased amylase and increased trypsinogen) in this long-term study, but not to modify the recovery of the exocrine pancreas 6 months following Arg-induced pancreatitis.
