Role of hyaluronan in acute pancreatitis. The connective tissue component hyaluronan is accumulated locally in the damaged tissue during various inflammatory conditions. Owing to the strong water-binding capacity of this glycosaminoglycan, increased tissue content of hyaluronan is paralleled by the development of interstitial edema. The aim with the current experiment was to investigate whether hyaluronan is accumulated in acute pancreatitis and if increased levels of hyaluronan can be correlated to the inflammation of the pancreatic tissue.Acute pancreatitis was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by the administration of supramaximal doses of the cholecystokinin analogue caerulein. The animals were followed for 5 hours (n = 4), 24 hours (n = 6), or 48 hours (n = 5), and the pancreata were then investigated for hyaluronan and water content, hyaluronan distribution, general morphology and the presence of CD44-positive cells, macrophages, and T lymphocytes.Hyaluronan accumulated in the edematous interstitium during acute pancreatitis. Twenty-four hours after the induction of pancreatitis, the hyaluronan content of the pancreata had increased by more than 100%. Simultaneously, CD44-positive cells infiltrated the tissue. However, no correlation between hyaluronan and water was seen at any time point.This study shows that acute pancreatitis is associated with a strong but transient increase in interstitial hyaluronan and an infiltration of CD44-positive cells located mainly in the same region as the accumulated hyaluronan.
