The role of cysteine proteases in intracellular pancreatic serine protease activation. Autodigestion by proteolytic enzymes is thought to represent the critical mechanism by which acute pancreatitis is initiated. Where and why pancreatic proteases, which are physiologically stored and secreted as inactive precursor zymogens, are activated within the pancreas has remained controversial. Here we present data which indicate that: the lysosomal protease cathepsin B can activate trypsinogen in vitro in a manner that is similar to trypsinogen activation by enterokinase that cathepsin B colocalizes with trypsinogen in the secretory compartment of the rat pancreas and of the human pancreas
