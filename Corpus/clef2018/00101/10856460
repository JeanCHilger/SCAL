Epidermal growth factor accelerates pancreatic recovery after caerulein-induced pancreatitis. We examined the influence of endogenous and exogenous epidermal growth factor (EGF) on pancreatic repair after acute pancreatitis. Caerulein-induced pancreatitis was evoked in rats with intact or removed salivary glands and EGF (10 microg/kg) was administered starting 24 h after cessation of caerulein infusion. The dose of EGF 10 microg/kg was chosen because it was the most effective in preliminary experiments when 1, 10 or 50 microg/kg of EGF was used. Caerulein administration caused acute edematous pancreatitis with biochemical and histological manifestation of pancreatic damage, followed by spontaneous regeneration. The effect of salivectomy on the course of acute pancreatitis was slight, resulting in additional reduction in pancreatic blood flow, DNA synthesis and in an increase in plasma interleukin 1beta level. Treatment with EGF accelerated the healing of pancreatic damage, causing an increase in pancreatic blood flow and DNA synthesis. EGF caused faster normalization of plasma amylase and lipase activity and plasma interleukin 1beta concentration, as well as, this peptide accelerated the restoration of pancreatic amylase activity. On histological examination, EGF caused reduction of pancreatic damage and acceleration of tissue repair. We conclude that EGF reduces the severity of pancreatic damage evoked by caerulein-induced pancreatitis-related pancreatic damage and accelerates tissue repair. The beneficial effects of EGF appear to depend, at least in part, on the improvement of pancreatic blood flow, as well as on an increase of pancreatic cell growth and limitation of the activation cytokine release.
