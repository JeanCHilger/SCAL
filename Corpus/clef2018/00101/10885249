A case of acute pancreatitis that occurred after an operation of the lumbar spine. A 56-year-old female, who had been suffering from heart failure and diabetes mellitus, underwent posterior instrumentation in the prone position and anterior interbody fusion in the right lateral decubitus position for pyogenic spondylitis between the fourth and fifth lumbar spine under general and epidural anesthesia. We induced hypotensive anesthesia by using continuous infusion of dopamine, prostaglandin E1 and nitroglycerin in order to prevent heart failure and reduce the blood loss. After the operation, the patient complained of upper abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. We found high levels of serum amylase and other pancreatic enzymes. The massive gas of small intestine was pooled in abdominal X-P, and the pancreatic head was slightly swollen in abdominal CT and US. Therefore we came to the diagnosis of postoperative acute pancreatitis. We administered a single bolus intravenous infusion of ulinastatine and continuous venous infusion of gabexate mesilate. As the serum amylase level gradually decreased, the patient improved. We suspect that postoperative pancreatitis was due to invasive anesthetic and surgical stress on the patient who had had pancreatitis in the preoperative period.
