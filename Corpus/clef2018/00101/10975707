Relationship between plasma cytokine concentration and multiple organ failure in patients with acute pancreatitis. The dynamic aspects of circulating cytokines and cytokine modulators and their relationship with development of multiple organ failure (MOF) in patients with acute pancreatitis were analyzed. All cytokine and C-reactive protein levels in the circulation were higher than those in the MOF group. In particular, plasma concentrations of soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors (sTNF-RI and sTNF-RII) were significantly higher in patients with MOF than in those without even at admission. Furthermore, plasma concentrations of sTNF-Rs and interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) were much higher than those of their counterparts, TNFalpha and IL-beta, respectively. These results suggest that the plasma concentrations of sTNF-Rs are useful predictors for the development of MOF, and actions of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta could be regulated by their modulators (soluble receptor and receptor antagonist, respectively) in the pathologic condition of severe acute pancreatitis.
