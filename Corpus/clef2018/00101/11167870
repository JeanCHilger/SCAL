Activation peptide of carboxypeptidase B and anionic trypsinogen as early predictors of the severity of acute pancreatitis. Early prediction of severity is important in the management of patients with acute pancreatitis. The presence of activation peptides and certain pancreatic proenzymes in plasma and urine has been shown to correlate with severity. This study was designed to assess the value of measuring levels of the activation peptide of carboxypeptidase B (CAPAP) and of anionic trypsinogen.Concentrations of CAPAP and anionic trypsinogen were measured in the urine and serum in 60 patients with acute pancreatitis. Preset cut-off levels were used to analyse the accuracy of the tests. Severity was classified retrospectively according to the Atlanta classification.Concentrations of CAPAP in urine and serum and of anionic trypsinogen in urine correlated with the severity of the pancreatitis. CAPAP in urine showed the highest accuracy. The overall accuracy was 90 per cent, with a positive predictive value of 69 per cent and a negative predictive value of 98 per cent.In this study, measurement of CAPAP in urine was an accurate way to predict the severity of acute pancreatitis, and was superior to assay of anionic trypsinogen in urine and serum. Measurement of CAPAP in urine may be of value in the management of individual patients with pancreatitis and in the selection of patients for therapeutic trials.
