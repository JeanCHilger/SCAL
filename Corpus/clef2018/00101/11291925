Endothelin mediates local and systemic disease sequelae in severe experimental pancreatitis. Endothelin-1 has been shown to reduce pancreatic blood flow and cause focal acinar cell necrosis similar to those seen in acute pancreatitis (AP), whereas therapy with endothelin receptor antagonists enhanced pancreatic capillary blood flow (PCBF) and decreased mortality rates. The current study evaluated the role of endothelin in the development of severe AP. Trypsinogen activation peptides, acinar cell necrosis, and PCBF were used as local indicators of disease severity, fluid sequestration, cardiorespiratory and renal parameters, and colonic capillary blood flow as systemic disease indicators. The following groups of animals were examined: 1) rats with mild edematous AP and 2) severe necrotizing AP treated with and without endothelin, 3) transgenic rats overexpressing endothelin with severe AP, and 4) rats with severe AP prophylactically treated with endothelin receptor antagonists. The following observations were made: endothelin superimposed on mild AP caused hemoconcentration, a decrease in PCBF, and necrosis and ascites not seen in this model without endothelin exposure. Endothelin superimposed on severe AP had no significant effects. After induction of severe AP, less PCBF and more acinar cell necrosis were observed in transgenic rats than in their normal littermates. Prophylactic endothelin receptor antagonists improved local (acinar necrosis, PCBF) and systemic parameters (ascites, urine production, colonic capillary blood flow) of disease severity in animals with severe AP. These observations underscore the role of endothelin as a mediator of disease severity in AP and suggest that endothelin receptor blockade may become a promising therapeutic tool in this disease.
