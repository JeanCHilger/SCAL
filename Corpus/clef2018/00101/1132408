Hemodynamic and angiographic changes after Mustard operation for transposition of the great arteries. After Mustard operation for transposition of the great arteries, hemodynamic and angiocardiographic changes were evaluated in 25 patients. In 19 patients, postoperative studies were done electively and, in 6 patients, they were required to investigate symptoms of heart failure, these symptoms were temporary in 4 patients and progressive in 2. Both of the latter had pulmonary venous obstruction which was later relieved successfully by reoperation. After operation, systemic arterial oxygen saturation and blood pressure increased and polycythemia disappeared in every patient. However, several complications-some of them unsuspected clinically-were identified by cardiac catheterization: (a) patch detachment in 5 patients (b) obstruction of superior vena caval return in 10 patients
