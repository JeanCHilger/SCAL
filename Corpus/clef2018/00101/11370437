Chloralhydrate in children undergoing echocardiography. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is a painless, noninvasive and risk-free diagnostic method in children with known or suspected congenital heart disease. Sedation is frequently required for an optimal achievement of this procedure. The purpose of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of chloral hydrate (CH) sedation in undergoing TTE. The study population included 360 patients with a median age of 19 months. (2 weeks to 8 years). The median dosage of CH given was 75 mg/kg (ranging 50 and 100 mg), with either oral or rectal administration.

Prior to CH administration and until discharge respiratory rate
