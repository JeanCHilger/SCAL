The effects of cefephim, G-CSF, and sucralfate on bacterial translocation in experimentally induced acute pancreatitis. The preventive effects of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, cefephim, and sucralfate on bacterial translocation in experimentally induced acute pancreatitis were investigated. Forty male Wistar albino rats were used in this study. For each rat, the pancreatobiliary ductus was ligated and hence acute pancreatitis was induced. In the control group, no further procedure was performed. Meanwhile, cefephim as an antibiotic, filgrastim, which is a colony-stimulating factor, and sucralfate were given to the other groups at the specified doses. To inhibit bacterial translocation by preserving the bowel barrier, sucralfate, which is known to have a cytoprotective effect on the gastrointestinal system, was used in high doses. Cefephim 30 mg/kg per day (intramuscularly) in group II, filgrastim 10 mg/kg per day (subcutaneously) in group III, and sucralfate 50 mg/kg per day by 8-F feeding tube gavage into the stomach in group IV were given. The number of bacteria translocated into the mesenteric lymph nodes, pancreas, liver, and spleen in the control group significantly increased in comparison with the other groups (P < 0.05). The average number of leukocytes (per mm3) in the control group was significantly higher than that of other groups (P < 0.0001). Regarding the average serum amylase levels, the values of all groups clearly decreased in comparison with the control group (P < 0.0001). Although in the cefephim, filgrastim, and sucralfate groups, (+) pancreatitis was generally seen, in the control group (+++) pancreatitis was detected. Bacterial translocation to the mesenteric lymph nodes and pancreas was partially prevented by filgrastim and sucralfate, and was completely prevented by cefephim. We conclude that in the management of acute pancreatitis, the use of the prophylactic antibiotics, sucralfate and filgrastim, may be advantageous.
