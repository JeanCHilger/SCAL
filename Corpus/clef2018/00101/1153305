Pancreatic biologic reactions after Wirsung opacification under duodenoscopy. Preventive action of Frey's inhibitor (67 cases). After retrograde opacification of be pancreatic ducts by duodenoscopy, pancreatic biologic reactions have been studied, especially by amylasemia and lipasemia measures. These biologic reactions have been all the more frequent and intense as Wirsung's duct and its tributaries filling have been important. Frey's inhibitor had a proptious action on these biologic reactions therefore, it may be used as a preventive treatment.
