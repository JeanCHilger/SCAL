Early jejunal nutrition and changes in the immunological parameters of patients with acute pancreatitis. We have compared the effects of glutamine-rich Stresson Multi Fibre and of Nutrison Fibre nutrients on the changes of some immunological parameters of 16 patients with acute pancreatitis. Laboratory parameters included: total protein, albumin, prealbumin, retinol binding protein, IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE, complement components: C3, C4, acute phase proteins: C-reactive protein, transferrin, CD-markers of peripheral lymphocytes and activity of peripheral phagocytes.Nine patients were supplied with Stresson Multi Fibre and 7 patients with Nutrison Fibre, using a nasojejunal tube. The levels of serum proteins were measured with laser nephelometry, the CD markers of lymphocytes with flow cytometry and the phagocytic activity with chemiluminescence.The treatment with glutamine-rich Stresson resulted in significant elevations in the serum levels of IgG, retinol binding protein, compared to the effects of Nutrison Fibre. In addition, the recovery of treated patients was significantly shorter in the Stresson Multi Fibre group than in the Nutrison Fibre group.The Stresson Multi Fibre nutrient treatment of patients treated for acute pancreatitis seems to have clinical benefit based upon the fast recovery of IgG, IgM proteins which take part in the immunological defense mechanisms.
