Pathogenetic concepts of chronic pancreatitis. Summary. The understanding of the pathogenesis of chronic pancreatitis is limited. Several theories (i. e. obstruction hypothesis) were suggested in the past but could not be confirmed by experimental data. As a formal description of the course of the disease, the necrosis-fibrosis concept seems to be very attractive. According to this theory, there is no significant difference in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic pancreatitis. A major step was the identification of mutations of the cationic trypsinogen, the secretory trypsin inhibitor (SPINK 1) and the cystic-fibrosis protein (CFTR) in some patients. Investigation of these mutations may significantly contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of chronic pancreatitis.
