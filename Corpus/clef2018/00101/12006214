New laboratory tests in acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a common disease with wide variation of severity. The diagnosis of AP is usually based on high serum amylase or lipase values but the accuracy of these methods is considered unsatisfactory. One in five of the patients develops a severe disease and carries a considerable risk of development of organ failure and high mortality. Early detection of patients with severe AP and especially those with increased risk of organ failure is importance since such patients seem to benefit from treatment in an intensive care unit started as soon as possible after presentation. In addition to enzymological methods, increasing interest has been focused on laboratory markers reflecting the level of inflammatory response in AP. At present, in routine clinical work the most commonly used severity marker is serum C-reactive protein, the concentration of which rises too slowly to be used for early prediction of severity. New therapies aiming at modifying the course of systemic inflammation in AP are being developed and therefore monitoring the patient's immune inflammatory status is needed. In this review article we present the current knowledge of laboratory tests, which has been evaluated for diagnostic and prognostic purposes in AP.
