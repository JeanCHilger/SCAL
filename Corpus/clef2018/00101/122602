Cholecystokinin and secretin prevent the intestinal mucosal hypoplasia of total parenteral nutrition in the dog. Because the pancreas undergoes involutional changes during total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and because pancreatico-biliary secretions are trophic to the intestine, we studied jejunal and ileal structure and function and exocrine pancreatic function before and after 6 weeks of TPN in two groups of beagle dogs, one of which had TPN alone, the other having TPN plus daily stimulation of pancreatico-biliary secretions with intravenous infusions of cholecystokinin (CCK) and secretin. The injections of 1 U each per kg of body weight per day of CCK and secretin completely prevented the proximal and distal small bowel mucosal hypoplasia which developed in the TPN alone group. They also resulted in significant increases in in vivo galactose absorption (64 mM) per unit length of jejunum and ileum. However, there was no significant change in mucosal alpha-glucosidase and catalase activity or in in vitro mucosal uptake of 1 mM [14C]leucine when expressed per unit weight of intestinal mucosa. The capacity of the pancreas to respond to CCK and secretin was unaffected by excluding food from the intestine with 6 weeks of TPN in terms of pH, volume, and peak secretion rates of bicarbonate and protein, but maximum amylase output (units per 15 min per kg of body weight) fell significantly (P less than 0.05) from a mean of 1022 +/- 155 to 874 +/- 426 in TPN alone group and to 472 +/- 79 in the TPN dogs given CCK and secretin. These results show that daily CCK and secretin is trophic to the intestine of dogs nourished by TPN but do not indicate whether this trophic effect is attributable to CCK alone, secretin alone, the combination of the two hormones, or to the resultant stimulation of pancreatico-biliary secretions.
