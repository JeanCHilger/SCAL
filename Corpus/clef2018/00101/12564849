Hyperamylasaemia and multiple myeloma. This case report describes a 42-year-old Caucasian woman who presented with persistent hyperamylasaemia and no evidence of pancreatic pathology. Further investigations resulted in a diagnosis of light-chain multiple myeloma. Amylase production by epithelial tumours has been well documented but the association with multiple myeloma has only been described in a small number of cases. The link does not appear to be immunoglobulin class-specific but the association with Bence Jones myeloma is unusual. The common features in this group of patients have been extensive extramedullary spread with a high tumour mass and a poor prognosis. This case was similar in that the patient showed very rapid disease activity developing extensive metastatic lesions and treatment ultimately proved unsuccessful. The amylase concentrations have been shown to decrease in response to treatment and increase at times of relapse and it has been proposed that it may be useful as a tumour marker in these patients. This case study adds to the pool of patents with this unusual association.
