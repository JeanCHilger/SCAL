The clinicopathological studies on patients with pancreaticobiliary maljunction that was detected by intraoperative cholangiography under laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinicopathological features of patients with pancreaticobiliary maljunction, which was detected by intraoperative cholangiography in laparoscopic cholecystectomy.Among 78 patients who underwent intraoperative cholangiography in laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 8 patients had the radiological findings of pancreaticobiliary maljunction. The clinicopathological factors were analyzed in them.They consisted of 2 males and 6 females with a mean age of 57.8 years (range: 36-76 years). Preoperatively, 7 patients were diagnosed as cholelithiasis and one was diagnosed as polypoid lesions of the gallbladder. None of them had dilated choledochus. All of them underwent cholecystectomy alone extrahepatic bile duct resection was omitted, and was performed. Histopathologic examinations of the resected gallbladder revealed epithelial hyperplasia in one patient, in whom amylase level of the gallbladder bile was also highly elevated. Postoperatively, none of them had acute pancreatitis, cholangitis, or biliary cancer.Further prolonged careful follow-up is warranted in our series of patients.
