Effects of sulfhydryl compounds on pancreatic cytoprotection in acute necrotic pancreatitis. To observe sulfhydryl compound variation in the injury of pancreatic cells and the effects of external sulfhydryl compounds on cytoprotection.Male Wistar mice were divided randomly into three groups: groups A and B served as animal models (retrograde duct infusion with 5% sodium taurocholate), in group A, 45 animals were treated with normal saline therapy, in group B, 45 animals were treated with Tiopronin therapy and group C, 15 animals, were designated as normal control. Animals were killed at 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 h, and pancreatic tissue was analyzed for total sulfhydryl (TSH), nonprotein sulfhydryl (NPSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA). Histopathology, serum amylase (Sam) and C reactive protein (CRP) were assessed as well.Levels of Sam and CRP increased in both group A and group B, with corresponding pathological changes of acute nerotic pancreatitis (ANP). Levels of TSH, NPSH and protein sulfhydryl (PSH) in group A decreased markedly during pancreatitis (P < 0.01), but MDA increased significantly (P < 0.01). The depletion of NPSH in group B was markedly ameliorated at 4 h or 6 h, when Tiopronin was prophylactically administered (P < 0.05), after which the level of MDA showed very little increase when compared to group A (P < 0.01). Histopathological damage was attenuated to a certain extent, in regards to serum amylase and CRP.All sulfhydryl compounds decreased significantly during ANP external sulfhydryl compound could protect the pancreatic cells most likely as a type of scavengers of oxygen free radicals, which are critically involved in the pathophysiology of ANP. Sulfhydryl plays an important role in the action of pancreatic cytoprotection.
