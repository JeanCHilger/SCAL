Fatal brain stem event complicating acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis, developing in a patient with chronic renal failure, was complicated by a fatal neurological illness during which MRI showed pontine and extrapontine changes consistent with pontine and extrapontine myelinolysis. At post mortem, acute pancreatitis was confirmed but the neuropathological findings were more in keeping with an unusual presentation of acute haemorrhagic leucoencephalitis, perhaps even representing a form of 'pancreatic encephalopathy'. Although the development of CT and MRI scanning has greatly increased the resolution of neuroimaging and facilitated diagnosis during life, the value of autopsy examination is confirmed in cases such as this. Sometimes the findings may raise more questions than may have been answered - this too is an important function!
