Duodenum-preserving resection of the pancreatic head with the ultrasonic coagulating shears. Duodenum-preserving resection of the pancreatic head is a risk factor for pancreatic fistula because of the wide surface of the transected pancreas. We report on a 72-year-old woman undergoing this procedure for cystadenoma in the pancreatic head using the ultrasonic coagulating shears. The soft pancreatic parenchyma was extensively transected around the cyst with the coagulating shears. Suture of the cut stump was not necessary due to absence of bleeding. The distal pancreatic duct was well preserved for pancreatojejunostomy. We oversewed the possible opening of the main pancreatic duct on the remaining pancreas attached to the duodenum after confirming the location by intrabiliary dye injection. The postoperative course was uneventful. The draining fluid amylase level was low and there were no viscous materials from the drains. We compared histologic changes of a porcine pancreas transected with the coagulating shears or electrocautery to evaluate the sealing effect of the transected surface. The cut stump was covered by a continuing layer of thick protein coagulum in cases of coagulating shears, but by a disrupted layer of coagulating necrosis with charring in cases of electrocautery. The coagulating shears are useful for pancreatic transection in duodenum-preserving resection of the pancreatic head to prevent bleeding and pancreatic fistula from the cut surface.
