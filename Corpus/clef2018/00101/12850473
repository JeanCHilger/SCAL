Trypsinogen-2 and trypsinogen activation peptide (TAP) in urine of patients with acute pancreatitis. There is an obvious clinical need for a simple test that can identify patients at risk of developing severe acute pancreatitis. In this work we compared urinary trypsinogen-2 with urinary trypsinogen activation peptide (TAP) and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) for early differentiation between mild and severe acute pancreatitis.The study population consisted of 127 consecutive patients with acute pancreatitis of whom 29 had severe disease. Urinary trypsinogen-2 was measured by a quantitative immunofluorometric assay and TAP by a competitive immunoassay. Serum CRP was determined by immunoturbidimetry.The sensitivity and specificity to identify severe acute pancreatitis on admission was 72% and 81% for urinary trypsinogen-2, 64% and 82% for urinary TAP, and 29% and 93% for serum CRP, respectively. At 24 h after admission, the values were 82% and 78% for urinary trypsinogen-2, 52% and 92% for urinary TAP, and 84% and 72% for serum CRP, respectively. Receiver-operating characteristics curve analysis showed that the area under the curve was larger for urinary trypsinogen-2 than for urinary TAP and serum CRP on admission and 24 h after admission. On admission the positive likelihood ration for urinary trypsiongen-2 was 3.7, for urinary TAP 3.6, and 4.3 for serum CRP, respectively. The corresponding negative likelihood ratios were 0.34, 0.43, and 0.76, respectively.Urinary trypsinogen-2 was superior to serum CRP and as god as or even better than urinary TAP and in the early prediction of disease severity in acute pancreatitis. These results suggest that it could be a valuable adjunct in the early assessment of the severity of acute pancreatitis.
