Effect of long-term CCK blockade on the pancreatic acinar cell renewal in rats with acute pancreatitis. This study determines the effect of 7-day pretreatment with L364,718 (a potent cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonist) on pancreatic cell turnover during the course of acute pancreatitis (AP) induced in the rat by bile-pancreatic duct obstruction (BPDO). Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry using propidium iodide (PI) and Annexin V staining. Besides altering the pancreatic redox status, long-term CCK blockade inhibited the normal proliferation of acinar cells as indicated by the significant increase in G(0)/G(1)-phase cells and the decrease in G(2)/M-cells found in control rats treated with L364,718 for 7 days. A progressive depletion in pancreatic GSH was found from 3 to 24h after BPDO with similar values in L364,718-pretreated and non-treated rats, which led to a maximum peak in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels 6h after BPDO. However, plasma amylase activity and ascites volume indicated higher severity of AP in L364,718-pretreated rats. CCK blockade enhanced the alterations that appear in cell cycle distribution of acinar cells during AP demonstrated by the significantly higher increase in G(0)/G(1)-cells and decrease in S-cells found in L364,718-treated rats 48h after BPDO. Our results indicate that the renewal of acinar cells deleted by apoptosis 48h after BPDO worsens if CCK is blocked before inducing AP.
