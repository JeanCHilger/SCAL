Platelet activating factor (PAF) inhibitor (TCV-309) reduces caerulein- and PAF-induced pancreatitis. A morphologic and functional study in the rat. Caerulein-induced acute pancreatitis was studied in rats. Consistent with this type of acute pancreatitis morphological (edema, leukocytic infiltration and acinar cell vaculization) and biochemical (increase in pancreatic protein content. PAF release and serum amylase) changes developed 5 hours after caerulein administration. In addition increase in pancreatic weight and decrease in pancreatic blood flow were noticed. PAF administration caused pancreatic damage similar in some parameters to caerulein-induced pancreatitis, along with reduction of pancreatic blood flow, increase in pancreatic protein content, and serum amylase. TCV-309, a selective PAF antagonist, administered prior to caerulein and/or PAF, reduced caerulein-induced pancreatitis and prevented PAF-induced pancreatitis. Results of our present studies indicate the crucial role of PAF in pathogenesis of experimental acute pancreatitis.
