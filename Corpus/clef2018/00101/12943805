Caerulein-induced pancreatitis and islet blood flow in anesthetized rats. Microcirculatory mechanisms have been suggested to be involved in the development of acute pancreatitis. Islet blood flow has not previously been studied in this disease. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of caerulein-induced pancreatitis on pancreatic blood perfusion, especially islet blood flow.Continuous 4 h caerulein-infusion was used to induce mild, edemateous pancreatitis in anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats. Some animals were then given an additional 2 h infusion of saline. Thus, at 4 or 6 h after initiating caerulein infusion the blood flow to the pancreas, pancreatic islets, and intestines was measured with a microsphere technique.All infused animals demonstrated an edemateous pancreatitis, without hemorrhages. Both total pancreatic and islet blood flow was increased after the 4-h infusion. However, the increase was less pronounced in the islets. After an additional 2 h with only saline infused, the blood flow values in rats initially infused with caerulein were lower than at 4 h, but total pancreatic blood was still higher than in control rats. No effects on intestinal blood flow values were seen.Pancreatic islet blood flow in rats with mild edematous pancreatitis is increased, but not to the same extent as that in the whole pancreas.
