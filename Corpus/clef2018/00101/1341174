The dilatation of the residual stenosis due to a Blalock-Taussig anastomosis by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. A ten-months-old white infant had undergone surgical modified Blalock-Taussig anastomosis at 2 months of age. An interposition of bovine mammary artery was anastomosed with the right subclavian artery. A satisfactory clinical follow-up after surgery was achieved, until the last three months when cyanotic spells were observed. A new angiographic study showed tricuspid and pulmonary atresia and severe stenosis (+/- 80%) at the anastomosis between the subclavian artery and the bovine mammary tissue. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was successfully performed. An immediate improvement of cyanosis and oxygen saturation were observed.
