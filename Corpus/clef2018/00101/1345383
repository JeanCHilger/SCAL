Influence of bile on the severity of acute experimental pancreatitis induced by closed duodenal loop in rat. The study was performed to assess the ethiological role of bile in acute pancreatitis provoked by closed duodenal loop in rat. In group I a closed duodenal loop was created by method of Nevalainen. A similar operation was performed in group II, but the common pancreatico-biliary duct was ligated just under the liver. In the control group (group C) only the mobilization of duodenum was performed. After 24 hours the mortality rate was 20% in group I, but 0% in group II and C. The amount of ascitic fluid showed significant elevation in group I versus II and group C, and in group II as compared to group C, too. The serum amylase was significantly higher in group I than group II and group C, and in group II was also higher as compared to group C. Serum total protein differed significantly between all groups, while albumin and total calcium were significantly lower in group I than group II, but group II was only slightly reduced versus group C. Histology showed no differences between groups I and II, but both differed significantly from group C. In conclusion bile seems to be an aggressive factor in pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis induced by closed duodenal loop in rat, but other factors may play more important roles.
