Lipase latex test for acute abdominal pain: comparison with serum lipase, trypsin, elastase and amylase. The diagnostic capacity of a semiquantitative latex test for lipase measurement was compared with the measurement of other pancreatic enzymes in 100 consecutive patients admitted to a general hospital for recent onset of severe abdominal pain. Positive results of the test were found in two patients with acute pancreatitis, and in one out of three chronic pancreatitis relapses. The test yielded false-positive results only in two patients who had no apparent pancreatic involvement. A marginal increase in other pancreatic enzymes was found in a few patients with acute biliary or appendicular problems. In conclusion, the lipase latex test can be suggested in an emergency setting as a quick and reliable alternative to serum amylase to rule out a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.
