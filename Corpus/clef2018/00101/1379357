Acute pancreatitis in children with anticholinesterase insecticide intoxication. Gastrointestinal symptoms are commonly seen in anticholinesterase insecticide intoxication. A few studies in adults have demonstrated some evidence for pancreatic damage in this poisoning. To see whether this association exists also in children, we conducted a prospective study in 17 consecutive children with typical organophosphate and carbamate poisoning. On admission and following recovery, serum amylase, immunoreactive trypsin, glucose, calcium, urea, creatinine, and arterial blood gas values were determined and compared with those of age-matched control subjects. Acute pancreatitis was diagnosed in 5 subjects. They demonstrated significantly elevated (greater than mean + 2 SD) serum levels of both immunoreactive trypsin (914.0 +/- 317.4 ng/mL, 159.9 +/- 36.4 ng/mL, and 169.7 +/- 41.2 ng/mL, respectively P less than .01) and amylase (448.0 +/- 264.4 U/L, 152.8 +/- 90.9 U/L, and 56.8 +/- 26.3 U/L, respectively
