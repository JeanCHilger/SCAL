Exocrine pancreatic function in obstructive jaundice rats: studies with isolated dispersed pancreatic acini. This study was conducted to investigate pancreatic exocrine function and pancreatic growth in rats with obstructive jaundice (OJ). OJ was produced in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats by bile duct ligation control rats underwent laparotomy only. Induction of OJ was associated with significant hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the pancreas in rats as shown by increased DNA and RNA contents of pancreatic tissue. Factors associated with pancreatic growth in OJ rats were further examined in isolated dispersed pancreatic acini from OJ rats and the data were compared with those for control rats. Studies with isolated dispersed acini from OJ rats showed that pancreatic growth was accompanied by significant increases in total cellular amylase content
