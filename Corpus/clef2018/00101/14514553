Comparison of different approaches for pediatric congenital heart diseases. To compare the clinical results of different surgical approaches for congenital heart disease in pediatric patients, 1669 cases of atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, or tetralogy of Fallot, which were corrected from January 1999 to December 2001, were classified according to approach (sternotomy, ministernotomy, or minithoracotomy). In cases of ventricular septal defect, the incidence of pulmonary complications was significantly higher in the minithoracotomy group than in the full sternotomy or ministernotomy groups. In patients with tetralogy of Fallot, hemoglobin concentration was higher, oxygen saturation was lower, and more patients required a transanular patch in the sternotomy group than in the other groups, but the clinical results were similar. Patients with complex defects or severe pulmonary hypertension should undergo a full sternotomy.
