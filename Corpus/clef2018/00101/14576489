Pathophysiology of alcohol-induced pancreatitis. Excessive ethanol consumption is a common risk factor for acute and chronic pancreatitis. Ethanol could lead to the onset of pancreatitis in a number of ways the most recently discovered is its effect on intrapancreatic digestive enzyme activation, by either sensitizing acinar cells to pathologic stimuli or stimulating the release of a secretagogue (cholecystokinin) from duodenal I cells. Recent advances in cell biologic and molecular techniques have permitted us to address the intracellular events involved in digestive enzyme activation in a manner that was previously considered impossible. Investigations that used these novel techniques found that (a) trypsin is, in contrast to its role in the small intestine, not necessarily involved in the premature intracellular activation of other digestive proteases such as proelastase
