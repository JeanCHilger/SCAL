Anesthetic management of an infant with a single ventricle (asplenia syndrome) for non-cardiac surgery. Ketamine and fentanyl were used for surgery of esophageal hiatus hernia in a 9 month old boy with single ventricle (asplenia syndrome). The patient was orally premedicated with diazepam 2.5 mg, and intravenously with atropine 0.04 mg. General anesthesia was induced with ketamine-fentanyl-pancuronium-100% oxygen, and maintained with fentanyl-pancuronium-100% oxygen. The total dose of ketamine or fentanyl was 0.8 mg.kg-1 or 15 micrograms.kg-1, respectively. Systolic blood pressure and heart rate of the patient were stable during ketamine-fentanyl anesthesia. Arterial oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry was over 90% and arterial oxygen tension was above 60 mmHg during the operation. Ketamine-fentanyl anesthesia might be useful for non-cardiac surgery of a child with cyanotic congenital heart disease.
