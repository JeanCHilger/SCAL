Effects of combined nutritional therapy on acute necrotizing pancreatitis in rats in the early phase of the disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of a small amount of enteral nutrition along with parenteral nutrition on acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP) induced by glycodeoxycholic acid in rats in the early phase of disease. The induction of ANP resulted in a significant increase in mortality rate, intestinal permeability, bacterial infection in the pancreas and extrapancreatic organs, pancreatic necrosis and serum activity of urea and amylase, and a significant decrease in concentrations of calcium, protein and albumin. But no difference was observed between the pancreatitis groups. Significant hyperglycemia and increased liver transaminase activity were observed in rats treated with combined nutritional therapy (CNT). CNT did not improve the course of acute pancreatitis, intestinal permeability, bacterial translocation, or reduce the extent of acinar cell injury in ANP and is therefore unlikely to be of benefit in patients with pancreatitis in the early period.
