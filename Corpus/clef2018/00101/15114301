Low-molecular-weight heparin does not prevent acute post-ERCP pancreatitis. Studies suggest that heparin has anti-inflammatory effects that could prevent acute post-ERCP pancreatitis. The aim of this investigator-initiated, prospective, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study was to determine whether low-molecular-weight heparin can prevent acute post-ERCP pancreatitis.Patients at increased risk for acute post-ERCP pancreatitis based on assessment of known risk factors were randomized to receive low-molecular-weight heparin (Certoparin 3000 IU subcutaneously) or placebo (saline solution 0.3 mL subcutaneously) the day before ERCP. The drug was given 2 hours before and 22 hours after ERCP. Documentation and follow-up included patient history, risk factors for acute post-ERCP pancreatitis, procedure-related data, assessment of pain (visual analogue scale, need for pain medication), laboratory findings before and after ERCP (0, 4, and 24 hours), as well as post-ERCP complications. The two-sided Fisher exact test was used for statistical comparison, and a p value < or =0.05 was considered significant.A total of 458 patients were enrolled in the study. Data from 10 patients could not be evaluated, leaving 221 patients in the low-molecular-weight heparin group and 227 in the placebo group (total 448 patients 135 men, 313 womenProphylactic subcutaneous administration of low-molecular-weight heparin does not prevent acute post-ERCP pancreatitis.
