The effects of verapamil in experimental acute pancreatitis in the rat. Experimental studies have shown that verapamil inhibits pancreatic exocrine secretion. In order to determine whether verapamil has any effect on acute pancreatitis (AP), we undertook an experimental study in Wistar rats. We used 72 animals divided into two groups. In all animals of both experimental groups, AP was induced by ligation of the biliary duct at its entrance in the duodenum. Animals were given saline (NaCl 0.9%), or 0.30 mgrs/hour verapamil. Subgroups of 9 animals, were treated for 6, 12, 18 and 24 hours 6 animals group were then sacrificed, for biochemical studies (serum amilase, lipase, and calcium
