The clinical value of the procalcitonin in prediction of severity and outcome in acute pancreatitis. Early identification of patients with severe forms of acute pancreatitis (AP) and subsequent management of these high risk patients are the most important aims in order to decrease mortality from AP. Procalcitonin (PCT) as a marker for systemic inflammation appears to be a useful marker for early identification of severe forms.101 patients with confirmed AP have been admitted to department of general surgery. PCT values were measured in each patient on admission and after 12 hours. PCT levels were correlated to the disease's course and prognosis. Results are given through PPV and NPV. Immunoluminometric assay (BRAHMS Diagnostica) was used for measurement.PPV and NPV for prediction of disease's course were better for PCT than for CRP PPV 64.7% versus 36% and NPV 82,6% versus 79.6% and for prediction of fatal outcome PCT reached 75% and 100% for cut off value 5 ng/ml.PCT seems to be a useful screening parameter for detecting severe AP and for identifying the patients who need ICU treatment, ATB covering and who can benefit from the novel therapies.
