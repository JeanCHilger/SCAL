Transcatheter palliation of congenital heart disease with reduced pulmonary blood flow. Although surgical shunt is still considered as the best palliation of congenital heart disease with reduced pulmonary blood flow, stent implantation may be technically simpler, safer and more cost-effective than surgery in high-risk patients. This study evaluated the feasibility and results of this option in patients with duct-dependent pulmonary blood flow or systemic-to-pulmonary shunt malfunction.Between April 2003 and July 2004, 9 patients (age 11 days-52 years, weight 2.1-52 kg) with complex congenital heart disease underwent stent implantation inside the patent ductus arteriosus (4 patients) or a stenotic surgical shunt (5 patients).The stenting procedure was successfully completed in all cases. The procedural time was 162 +/- 36 min (range 90-225 min). The fluoroscopy time was 33.8 +/- 6.8 min. No patient died. The morbidity rate was 22.2% (1 patient had local infection at the site of puncture and 1 had transient femoral artery pulse loss). After the procedure, the ductus/shunt diameter increased from 1.2 +/- 0.6 to 3.6 +/- 0.6 mm (p < 0.0001) and oxygen saturation improved from 74.0 +/- 6.5 to 85.2 +/- 3.3% (p < 0.01). Three patients underwent corrective surgery without technical problems after 8.0 +/- 1.0 months while oxygen saturation remained constantly >80% in patients still waiting for surgical repair (follow-up 5.3 +/- 3.1 months).Stent implantation is a technically feasible, safe and effective palliative option in high-risk surgical patients with congenital heart disease and reduced pulmonary blood flow. Although larger series are required to define the cost-effective clinical impact of this therapeutic option, it is reasonable to hypothesize a further extension of its indication even to elective and low-risk surgical patients.
