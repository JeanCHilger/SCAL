A case of recurrent pancreatitis due to hyperlipidemia misdiagnosed as familial Mediterranean fever. Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is prevalent among Arabic, Turkish, Armenian, and Jewish people and it must always be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients from these ethnic groups presenting with recurrent abdominal pain with fever. In cases of fever and recurrent abdominal pain, acute pancreatitis is an important clinical condition, which should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Serum amylase concentration in acute pancreatitis is usually more than three times the upper limit of normal. However, in recurrent pancreatitis secondary to hypertriglyceridemia, serum amylase levels, for reasons that are not well understood, may be normal or mildly elevated. Recurrent pancreatitis secondary to hypertriglyceridemia may thus pose a problem in the differential diagnosis and may lead to an erroneous diagnosis of FMF. Measurement of serum triglyceride along with amylase levels should be required for a suspected diagnosis. Computerized examination of the abdomen may need to be undertaken to exclude acute pancreatitis in the presence of hypertriglyceridemia since serum amylase levels may be normal or slightly elevated.
