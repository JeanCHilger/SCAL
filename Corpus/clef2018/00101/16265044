Mechanisms of disease: Advances in understanding the mechanisms leading to chronic pancreatitis. Chronic pancreatitis remains a challenging and frustrating clinical problem. In the past few years, however, advances in genetic and immunologic research have spawned new insights and approaches to chronic pancreatitis. Genetic and environmental risk assessment may help identify individuals who are likely to develop severe chronic pancreatitis early in the disease course, and allow targeted attention to reduce confounding risks and slow or prevent this problem in the future.
