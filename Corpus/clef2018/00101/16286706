Computed tomography severity index, APACHE II score, and serum CRP concentration for predicting the severity of acute pancreatitis. The assessment of the severity of pancreatitis is important for proper management of this challenging disease. A highly accurate system which could predict the severity and identify the local extent and complications of a serious inflammation, is beneficial for patient outcome.The aim was to establish the value of the computed tomography severity index in predicting the severity of acute pancreatitis and to compare it with the accuracy of the APACHE II score and serum CRP concentrations.Prospective clinical series.Fifty-five consecutive patients (37 women, 18 men mean age 57 years) with a clinical and laboratory diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.Clinical evaluation, biochemical analysis of blood and contrast-enhanced abdominal CT.Computed tomography severity index within the first 5 days, serum CRP level, and clinical APACHE II score at 48 hours after admission.Thirteen patients had severe pancreatitis according to the Atlanta classification. The mean values of predictive markers in the mild and the severe pancreatitis groups were: computed tomography severity index 1.26 and 6.30 (P<0.001) APACHE II 4.14 and 8.61 (P<0.001)The computed tomography severity index is a reliable method for staging the severity of acute pancreatitis moreover, CT has the ability of showing the local extent of the inflammation and the occurrence of local complications.
