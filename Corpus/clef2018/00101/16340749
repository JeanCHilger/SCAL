Applicability of disseminated intravascular coagulation parameters in the assessment of the severity of acute pancreatitis. To evaluate the clinical applicability of the determination of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) parameters in acute pancreatitis.The subjects for this study were 139 consecutive patients with acute pancreatitis. DIC parameters were assessed at the initial observation of these patients.The levels of the DIC parameters at admission were significantly associated with the severity and the prognosis of acute pancreatitis. Antithrombin III (AT-III), fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products-E, platelet count, D-dimer, and thrombin-AT-III complex at admission showed better area under the receiver operating characteristics curve values compared with C-reactive protein. An AT-III value of 69% at admission was the best cut-off value to predict fatal outcome (sensitivity, 81% specificity, 86%).The aggravated coagulation parameters predict a fatal outcome in patients with acute pancreatitis. AT-III level (<69%) was the most accurate marker for poor outcome of acute pancreatitis at admission.
