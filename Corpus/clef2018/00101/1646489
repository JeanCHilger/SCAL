Morphofunctional elements of the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis. Nineteen patients with acute pancreatitis were examined for the activity of LDH, NADH-tetrazolium oxidoreductase, acid phosphatase, the content of calcium salts, cAMP and cGMP in biopsy tissue of the pancreas pancreatic enzymes and bicarbonates in the duodenal contents and pancreatic juice. The activity of enzymes participating in oxidative metabolism in epithelial cells of the intact pancreas appeared elevated. During the development of destructive changes in the pancreatic parenchyma, the processes of intracellular oxidation get inhibited, the enzymes go out into the intercellular space, calcium transport gets impaired, and acid phosphatase is activated. It has been found that in acute destructive pancreatitis, primarily impaired are epithelial cells of the islets, followed by the impairment of the epithelium of the acini and at the last moment of that of the excretory ducts. The data obtained enable one to regard cyclonucleotides, calcium, pancreatic enzymes and lysosomal hydrolases as pathogenetic elements of acute pancreatitis.
