Rapid diagnosis of cannula migration by cerebral oximetry in neonatal arch repair. Although it has gained much interest in other surgical specialties, the application of near-infrared spectroscopy to assess cerebral perfusion during cardiac surgery is relatively new. Regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) is a function of cerebral oxygen supply and demand. Continuous monitoring of the rSO2 permits early detection of cerebral ischemia allowing for prompt intervention. The following is a description of a repair of truncus arteriosus with type A interrupted aortic arch during which continuous cerebral oximetry assisted with the positioning of the arterial cannula avoiding a prolonged episode of cerebral ischemia.
