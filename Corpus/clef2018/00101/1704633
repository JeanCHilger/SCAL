Fecal isoamylase activity in patients with pancreatic diseases. Fecal isoamylase activity was studied in 93 consecutive patients (26 in the recovery stage of acute pancreatitis, 24 with chronic pancreatitis, 13 with pancreatic cancer, and 30 with other gastrointestinal diseases) and compared with fecal chymotrypsin activity and the results of the secretin test. Seventy-six healthy subjects were studied as controls. Both pancreatic (p)-type and salivary (s)-type isoamylase activities in stool were determined by inhibitor assay as well as cellulose acetate electrophoresis. The mean fecal amylase activity in healthy subjects was 757 +/- 88 IU/g (p-type isoamylase: 77 +/- 2%, s-type isoamylase: 23 +/- 2%). There was a good correlation between fecal p-type isoamylase and chymotrypsin activities (r = 0.625, p less than 0.001). Fecal p-type isoamylase activity in patients with chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer was significantly lower than in healthy subjects (p less than 0.001). Patients with moderate and severe exocrine pancreatic insufficiency as determined by the secretin test had significantly lower fecal p-type isoamylase activity. Daily fat intake did not affect fecal amylase or isoamylase activities. Fecal s-type isoamylase activity in patients with hypoacidity was significantly higher than in patients with hyperacidity, but no difference in fecal p-type isoamylase activity was observed. It is concluded that analysis of fecal isoamylase activity is useful in the assessment of pancreatic function.
