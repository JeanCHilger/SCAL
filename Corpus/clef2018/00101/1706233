Lipase activity in serum measured with Ektachem is often increased in nonpancreatic disorders. For patients with symptoms of pancreatitis, measurement of amylase in serum reportedly is more sensitive than that of lipase in acute pancreatitis, whereas lipase reportedly is more specific. However, serum lipase activities exceeding the upper reference limit (URL) have been reported for many patients who did not have pancreatitis. I reviewed the serum lipase and amylase concentrations of 493 consecutive inpatients and emergency department patients for whom both tests were ordered. Serum lipase and amylase activities, determined with an Ektachem 700 analyzer, were less than or equal to URL for 390 patients (83%) and greater than URL for 103. Medical records of 101 of these 103 were reviewed 18 had acute or chronic relapsing pancreatitis. In this latter group, serum lipase values greater than URL had 100% sensitivity and 84% specificity
