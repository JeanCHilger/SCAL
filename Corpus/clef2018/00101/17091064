Acute pancreatitis following naproxen intake. Pancreatitis is a very rare complication of a few nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In this paper, we report a 20-year-old male as a case of acute pancreatitis following a suicidal attempt with naproxen sodium. We believe that, in this case, the pancreatitis was another example of a rare adverse reaction to the intake of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
