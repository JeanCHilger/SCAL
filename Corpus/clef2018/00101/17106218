Severe acute pancreatitis--outcome following a primarily non-surgical regime. Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) is associated with a high morbidity and mortality. The aim was to evaluate treatment, risk factors and outcome in SAP in a centre with a restrictive attitude to surgery.All cases of acute pancreatitis admitted 1994-2003 were analysed retrospectively. SAP was defined as organ failure and/or hospital stay >7 days together with one or more of: C-reactive protein >150 mg/l within 72 h after admission, necrosis on computed tomography and need for treatment in the intensive care unit.185 (22%) of patients with acute pancreatitis fulfilled the criteria for SAP. 175 patients were included, mean age 61 +/- 17 years. Hospital stay was in median 13 days. Forty-six patients had some surgical intervention, in 14 cases directed at the pancreas (8%). Hospital mortality was 9% (n = 16), in 88% (n = 14) associated with multiple organ dysfunction and 50% (n = 8) of the deaths occurred within the first week after admission. Of the parameters registered on admission, age and hypotension (systolic blood pressure <100 mm Hg) were identified as risk factors for death.The present treatment regime for SAP as defined above resulted in a 9% mortality rate, with age and hypotension at admission as predictive factors for death.
