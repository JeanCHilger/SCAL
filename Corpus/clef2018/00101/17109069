Role of enteral nutrition supplemented with ebselen and EHEC in pancreatitis-associated multiple organ dysfunction in rats. To investigate potential effects of ebselen and ethylhydroxyethyl cellulose (EHEC) on the acute phase responses and the severity of multiple organ dysfunction associated with acute pancreatitis.Acute pancreatitis was induced by intraductal infusion of 5% sodium taurodeoxycholate. The increase of total protein content in the BALF was used as an indication for acute lung injury, plasma amylase for pancreatic damage, plasma bilirubin for acute liver dysfunction, and plasma creatinine for acute kidney dysfunction. Levels of interleukin (IL)-6, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2 in the BALF were determined by ELISA.There was a dose-related tendency for ebselen or EHEC alone to prevent organ dysfunction and reduce elevated plasma levels of IL-6 and ICAM-1 expression on circulating leukocytes 12 h after AP induction. The combination of ebselen and EHEC significantly prevented pancreatitis-induced multiple organ injury, IL-6 production and ICAM-1 expression in rats and exhibited better effects than either monocompound alone.The combination of ebselen and EHEC may be a new potential for treatment of acute severe pancreatitis.
