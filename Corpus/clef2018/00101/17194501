PYY and the pancreas: inhibition of tumor growth and inflammation. Peptide YY (PYY) orchestrates function of the gut and pancreas by regulating growth, digestion and absorption. In addition to its physiological role, PYY exhibits immune and antitrophic properties in the pancreas by decreasing cytokine and amylase release. Although the exact mechanism(s) of action are still not fully understood, PYY interacts at the acinar level with numerous intracellular transcription factors. In addition to ameliorating pancreatic inflammation, novel synthetic analogs of PYY have been developed that are potent inhibitors in the proliferation of pancreatic cancer. The present paper reviews our current findings with PYY and examines the therapeutic implications of its utility in treating inflammation and cancer.
