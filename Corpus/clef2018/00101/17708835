Expression of substance P in intestinal tissue and the relation between substance P and mucosa permeability in acute necrotizing pancreatitis in rat. To investigate the expression of substance P in the intestinal tissue and the relation between expression of substance P and pathological change of intestinal mucosa or mucosal Permeability in acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP) in rat.One hundred and fifty adult Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into sham operation group (n=50) and ANP group (n=100). In sham operation group, the pancreatic was only flipped over. In ANP group, ANP was produced by administration of 5% sodium taurocholate into the pancreatic duct. Rats were sacrificed at 0, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours after reproduction of pancreatitis in both groups. The intestinal mucosal permeability was assessed with (99m)Technetium Diethylene Triamine Pentaacetic Acid method, and the expression of substance P was evaluated with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting analysis.In ANP group, level of serum amylase raised at different time points after reproduction, intestinal mucosal permeability and the expression of substance P were also significantly higher than those in the sham operation group (P<0.01, respectively). The expression of substance P was positively correlated with mucosal pathological score (r=0.67, P<0.01) and intestinal mucosal permeability index (r=0.78, P<0.01) in ANP.The expression of the substance P and the permeability in intestine of rats are enhanced significantly in ANP. The expression of substance P is positively correlated with intestinal mucosal permeability.
