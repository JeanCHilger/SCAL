Association of macroamylasemia and type I macro-creatine kinasemia. A case report. Macroenzymes are serum enzymes presenting a higher molecular mass than the corresponding enzymes normally found in physiologic conditions or specific diseases, causing falsely increased total serum enzyme levels. The occurrence of macroenzymes represents a rare event in clinical practice, leading to unnecessary and often invasive additional diagnostic procedures. Macroamylase and macro-creatine kinase belong to this category and may generate diagnostic confusion in the differential diagnosis between acute pancreatitis and acute myocardial infarction. Until now, the association of macroamylase and macro-creatine kinase in the same patient has never been described.A 68-year-old female patient presenting with increased serum levels of creatinine kinase and amylase at admission.This article reports the association of macroamylase and macro-creatine kinase in the same patient for the first time.
