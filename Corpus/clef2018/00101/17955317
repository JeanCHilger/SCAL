A soft pancreatic remnant is associated with increased drain fluid pancreatic amylase and serum CRP levels following pancreatoduodenectomy. The aim of this prospective study was to clarify differences in postoperative changes of serum or drainage fluid pancreatic amylase levels and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels between patients with a soft pancreatic texture and those with a hard pancreatic texture undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) with pancreaticogastrostomy. A total of 61 consecutive patients with resectable periampullary tumors undergoing PD were recruited. This population was divided into 27 patients with a hard pancreatic texture and 34 patients with a soft pancreatic texture. Drainage fluid total amylase or pancreatic amylase levels, serum total amylase or pancreatic amylase levels, and serum CRP levels were measured postoperatively. Clinicopathological data were also compared between two groups. Postoperative complications more frequently occurred in patients with a soft pancreatic texture compared with those with a hard pancreatic texture (P=0.029). Serum or drainage fluid pancreatic amylase levels and serum CRP levels of patients with a soft pancreatic texture were significantly higher than those of patients with a hard pancreatic texture after PD on postoperative days 1 and 2 (P<0.05). A soft pancreatic texture was identified as an only independent predictive factor of increased drainage fluid pancreatic amylase levels (P=0.006) and serum CRP levels (P=0.047). A soft pancreatic texture is closely associated with increased drainage fluid pancreatic amylase and serum CRP levels after PD. More careful post-PD management is needed for patients with a soft pancreatic texture.
