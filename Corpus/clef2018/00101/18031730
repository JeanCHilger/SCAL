Effects of resveratrol on calcium regulation in rats with severe acute pancreatitis. Intracellular calcium overload plays a key role in severe acute pancreatitis. Resveratrol can decrease the severity of pancreatitis however, the mechanism of action of resveratrol has not been determined. The aim of our study was to examine the relationship between calcium overload and the effects of resveratrol in severe acute pancreatitis. Animals were randomly divided into 3 groups: control group (sham operation), model group (0.1 ml/100 g of 3.5% sodium taurocholate used to induce severe acute pancreatitis), and treated group (treated with resveratrol, 10 mg/kg). In model group, the severity of pancreatitis was aggravated
