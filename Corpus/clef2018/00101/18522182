The article presents an analysis of results of examinations and treatment of 98 patients and an assessment of the clinical picture, laboratory and instrumental findings. The significance of USI as a method of screening diagnosis is stressed. The indications and possible endoscopic and videolaparoscopic interventions for the diagnosing and treatment of acute destructive biliary pancreatitis (ADP) are determined.
