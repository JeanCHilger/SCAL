Inhibition of Rac1 decreases the severity of pancreatitis and pancreatitis-associated lung injury in mice. Pancreatitis is a disease with high morbidity and mortality. In vitro experiments on pancreatic acini showed that supramaximal but not submaximal cholecystokinin (CCK) stimulation induces effects in the acinar cell that can be correlated with acinar morphological changes observed in the in vivo experimental model of cerulein-induced pancreatitis. The GTPase Rac1 was previously reported to be involved in CCK-evoked amylase release from pancreatic acinar cells. Here, we demonstrate that pretreatment with the Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766 (100 microM, 2 h) effectively blocked Rac1 translocation and activation in CCK-stimulated pancreatic acini, without affecting activation of its closely related GTPase, RhoA. This specific Rac1 inhibition decreased supramaximal (10 nM) CCK-stimulated acinar amylase release (27.% reduction), which seems to be connected to the reduction observed in serum amylase (46.6% reduction) and lipase levels (46.1% reduction) from cerulein-treated mice receiving NSC23766 (100 nmol h(-1)). The lack of Rac1 activation also reduced formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS 20.8% reduction) and lactate dehydrogenase release (LDH
