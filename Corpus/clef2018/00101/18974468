Acute pancreatitis in viral infections, with possible progression to chronic pancreatitis. Isolated cases and small series of acute pancreatitis complicating viral infections have been reported. However, data on the natural history of such patients are sparse. We report a series of five patients of acute pancreatitis complicating diverse viral infections. During follow-up ranging from 6 to 36 months, two of these five patients developed evidence of chronic pancreatitis.
