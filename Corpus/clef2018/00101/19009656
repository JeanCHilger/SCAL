Continuous regional arterial infusion therapy with gabexate mesilate for severe acute pancreatitis. To evaluate the efficacy of continuous regional arterial infusion therapy (CRAI) with gabexate mesilate and antibiotics for severe acute pancreatitis (SAP).We conducted a prospective study on patients who developed SAP with or without CRAI. Out of 18 patients fulfilled clinical diagnostic criteria for SAP in Japan, 9 patients underwent CRAI, while 9 patients underwent conventional systemic protease inhibitor and antibiotics therapy (non-CRAI). CRAI was initiated within 72 h of the onset of pancreatitis. Gabexate mesilate (2400 mg/d) was continuously administered for 3 to 5 d. The clinical outcome including serum inflammation-related parameters were examined.The duration of abdominal pain in the CRAI group was 1.9+/-0.26 d, whereas that in the non-CRAI group was 4.3+/-0.50. The duration of SIRS in the CRAI group was 2.2+/-0.22 d, whereas that in the non-CRAI group was 3.2+/-0.28. Abdominal pain and SIRS disappeared significantly in a short period of time after the initiation of CRAI using gabexate mesilate. The average length of hospitalization significantly differed between the CRAI and non-CRAI groups, 53.3+/-7.9 d and 87.4+/-13.9 d, respectively. During the first two weeks, levels of serum CRP and the IL6/IL10 ratio in the CRAI group tended to have a rapid decrease compared to those in the non-CRAI group.The present results suggest that CRAI using gabexate mesilate was effective against SAP.
