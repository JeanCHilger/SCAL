Effect of dachaihu decoction in treating acute mild pancreatitis of Gan-qi stagnant type. To observe the therapeutic effect of Dachaihu Decoction (DCHD) on acute mild pancreatitis of Gan-qi stagnant syndrome type.Thirty-six acute pancreatitis patients were randomized into three groups (Group A, B and C) equally, and they were treated with conventional Western medicine (WM), WM plus placebo and WM plus DCHD, respectively for 7 days. The time for pain relieving, fasting and total hospitalization were observed, and serum amylopsin and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were measured before treatment and at various time points after treatment.After treatment, amylopsin and CRP level significantly decreased in the 3 groups, comparing with those before treatment (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). In Group C, amylopsin level was obviously higher on dl, d3 and d5, CRP level was higher on dl, d3, d5 and d7, and the remission time of abdominal pain, the fasting time, as well as the hospitalization time were all significantly shorter than those in Group A and B (P < 0.05, P < 0.01).The accessory use of DCHD upon conventional Western medical treatment can strikingly shorten the course of disease and enhance the therapeutic effect on mild acute pancreatitis patients.
