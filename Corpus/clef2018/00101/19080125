Different cell death modes of pancreatic acinar cells on macrophage activation in rats. The pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis is complex and largely unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between modes of cell death in pancreatic acinar cells, the release of cell contents and the inflammatory response of macrophages.Our experiment included four groups: group A (the control group), group B (AR42J cells overstimulated by caerulein), group C (AR42J cells treated with lipopolysaccharide and caerulein), and group D (AR42J cells treated with octreotide and caerulein). Apoptosis and oncosis, and the release of amylase and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from AR42J cells were detected. Rat macrophages were stimulated by 1 ml supernatant of culture medium of AR42J cells. Finally, NF-kappaB activation and TNF-alpha and IL-1beta secretion by macrophages were detected.Oncotic cells in group C increased while apoptotic cells decreased (P < 0.05) cells in group D had the inverse reaction. The release of amylase and LDH changed directly with the occurrence of oncosis. The transcription factor NF-kappaB was activated and secretion of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta were significantly higher in group C than in group B (P < 0.05)There is a close relationship between modes of pancreatic acinar cell death, the release of cell contents and the inflammatory reaction of macrophages.
