Dose-related effect of propofol on pancreatic enzymes and triglyceride levels in patients undergoing non-abdominal surgery. Various case reports have indicated a possible relationship between propofol and pancreatitis. However, it is not clear whether this relationship (if any) is dose-related or idiosyncratic. Therefore, a prospective study was conducted to evaluate the effect of different doses of propofol on postoperative pancreatic enzymes and serum triglyceride levels. One hundred and fifty patients, aged 18 to 60 years, belonging to ASA physical status I and II, undergoing non-abdominal surgery were divided into three groups. Anaesthesia was induced with propofol 2 to 2.5 mg/kg in all groups. It was maintained with isoflurane in group I, propofol infusion < 5 mg/kg/h in group II and propofol infusion > or = 5 mg/kg/h in group III. All three groups also received nitrous oxide in oxygen for maintenance of anaesthesia. Serum amylase, lipase and triglyceride were estimated before propofol administration and at 24 and 72 hours postoperatively. The mean values of serum amylase, lipase and triglyceride remained within the normal range in the three groups. These values did not differ significantly in between the groups even despite the significantly different doses of propofol in the three groups (P < 0.001). None of the patients in the three groups developed any feature suggestive of acute pancreatitis in the postoperative period. These findings indicate that propofol administration at recommended doses does not produce dose-related increases in pancreatic enzyme and triglyceride levels in ASA physical status I and II patients.
