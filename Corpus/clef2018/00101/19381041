A case of drug induced interstitial pneumonitis after gemcitabine treatment for pancreatic carcinoma. A 67-year-old male with pancreatic cancer(cStage IVb)was given gemcitabine on days 1, 8 and 15, and this was repeated on 29 days at dose of 800 mg/m(2) in outpatient clinic. After 2 courses, he suffered from dyspnea and fever. Laboratory examination showed that the serum levels of white cell count, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase and KL-6 were elevated. Chest X-ray and CT revealed diffuse bilateral interstitial infiltrates. He was diagnosed with drug induced interstitial pneumonia due to gemcitabine. Corticosteroid therapy consisting of methylprednisolone(1,000 mg/day)for three days followed by prednisolone was effective and he was discharged on the 29th day after admission. Gemcitabine is an anti-cancer agent of first-line chemotherapy for patient with pancreatic carcinoma. Acute pulmonary toxicity induced by gemcitabine could lead to severe complication. We should consider the possibility of drug induced interstitial pneumonitis duringg emcitabine therapy.
