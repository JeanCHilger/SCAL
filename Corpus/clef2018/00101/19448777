Intrahepatic pancreatic pseudocyst. Intrahepatic pancreatic pseudocyst is an extremely rare complication of acute pancreatitis. Herein, we report the case of a 37-year old diabetic male who presented with mild pancreatitis as predicted by modified Glasgow criteria. Abdominal CT scan showed a left hepatic subcapsular cyst of 9x4 cm that progressively increased in size. CT guided aspiration of the cyst yielded 90 ml of yellow brown fluid with a high amylase concentration. Bacterial culture of the fluid was negative. The patient dramatically improved after aspiration 3 months later the patient was asymptomatic and follow-up abdominal ultrasound has shown complete resolution of the cyst.
