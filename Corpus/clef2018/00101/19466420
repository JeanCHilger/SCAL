Fatal acute pancreatitis complicated by pancreatic pseudocysts in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus. Pancreatitis is a relatively rare but severe manifestation in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. We report a case of a 39-year-old woman with previous SLE diagnose treated with prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil who developed an acute pancreatitis complicated by pancreatic pseudocysts within the context of a severe lupus flare. Elevated serum amylase and computerized tomography confirmed the diagnosis and mechanical obstruction or toxic-metabolic etiologies were ruled out. In the present case, we opted for the clinical surveillance of pancreatic pseudocyst and not perform invasive medical procedures to drainage. A steroid therapy was started in order to achieve SLE and pancreatitis remission, however, it was unable to avoid the development of multiorgan failure and patient died a few days after diagnosis was made.
