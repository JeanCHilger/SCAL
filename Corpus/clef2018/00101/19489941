Serum and 24-hour urine analysis in adult cyanotic and noncyanotic congenital heart disease patients. Glomerulopathy is a complication of congenital heart disease patients. The risk of developing renal impairment is particularly high in cyanotic patients.The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of renal dysfunction and microalbumiuria in adult cyanotic and non cyanotic congenital heart disease patients.Fourteen cyanotic and 22 noncyanotic congenital heart disease patients were studied in the Adult Congenital Heart Disease Unit at the Complejo Hospitalario Universitario Insular-Materno Infantil. Demographic characteristics, complete blood count, and 24-hour urianalysis were obtained, including abdominal ultrasound in those with cyanosis.No differences were seen between age (years) (27.4 +/- 8.2 26.4 +/- 8.3Renal impairment is frequently seen in congenital heart disease patients, being associated occasionally with proteinuria and microalbuminuria in cyanotic ones.
