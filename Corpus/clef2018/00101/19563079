The effect of rosiglitazone on the activity of STAT1 in rats with severe acute pancreatitis. To explore the effect of rosiglitazone on the activity of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 in rats with severe acute pancreatitis.Fifty-four male Wistar rats were randomly allocated into three groups (n = 18). SO group: sham-operated animals served as control, operation was executed and sodium chloride but not sodium taurocholate was injected. SAP group: SAP was induced by the retrograde injection of 5% sodium taurocholate into the biliopancreatic duct. ROSI group: same as SAP group, but rosiglitazone (6 mg/kg) was administered intravenously 30 min before operation. Rats in each group were sacrificed at 3,6 and 12 h after operation. The levels of serum amylase and histologic scores of pancreatic tissue were measured. The expression of TNF-alpha mRNA in pancreatic tissue were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The expression of phosphorylated STAT1 in pancreatic tissue was assayed by immunohistochemistry.Compared to SO group, the levels of serum amylase and phosphorylated STAT1, TNF-alpha mRNA and histologic scores of pancreatic tissue were significantly elevated at the same time points after SAP (P < 0.01). The levels of these detection in ROSI group were lower than those of the SAP group at the same time points (P < 0.05), but higher than SO group (P < 0.05).STAT1 was activated in severe acute pancreatitis. Rosiglitazone has a protective effects in rats with severe acute pancreatitis. The mechanism of its protective effects maybe that it inhibits the activation of JAK/STAT pathway, which can down-regulate the expression of TNF-alpha mRNA and block the the inflammatory cascade partially.
