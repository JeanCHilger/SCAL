Pancreatic enzyme elevation in chronic myeloid leukemia patients treated with nilotinib after imatinib failure. An increase in the serum concentration of pancreatic enzymes (amylase and lipase) was reported in a proportion of imatinib-resistant and/or intolerant Philadelphia-positive chronic myeloid leukemia patients treated with nilotinib. Acute pancreatitis was very rare, and the relevance of these laboratory alterations remains unknown. We report on 8 chronic myeloid leukemia patients who developed serum lipase/amylase elevation during treatment with nilotinib. After a median follow-up of 26 months, none of these patients developed an acute pancreatitis or clinical signs of pancreatic disease. Pancreatic hyperenzymemia never led to permanent drug discontinuation and required nilotinib temporary interruption in one case only. The median cumulative duration of dose interruptions and response to treatment were comparable in patients with or without pancreatic enzyme elevation. The mechanisms of action of nilotinib on pancreatic enzymes deserves to be investigated: however, in our experience, the relevance of pancreatic hyperenzymemia was clinically very limited.
