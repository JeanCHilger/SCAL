Elevation of resting fluid secretion precedes trophic responses in the rat pancreas following a single oral administration of Camostat. A single dose of the synthetic proteinase inhibitor, Camostat (FOY-305 100 mg/kg), was administered orally to rats. Pancreata were isolated and then perfused to examine the change in the level of resting fluid secretion. As early as 6 h after administration of the single dose of Camostat, the resting fluid secretion was significantly elevated. Twelve hours after administration, resting fluid secretion was maximally elevated, whereas contents of trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, and amylase per DNA in the pancreas were significantly decreased. After 12 h, the level of resting fluid secretion gradually decreased to the control resting level in contrast to significant increases in contents of the pancreatic enzyme and zymogens, and wet weight in acinar cells. We further examined the mechanism mediating the elevated resting fluid secretion. Our results are compatible with the view that the elevation of resting fluid secretion may be maintained by spontaneous activation of ion transporters: an ouabain-sensitive Na-K ATPase, an amiloride-sensitive Na-H antiporter, and a unique Cl transporter that is insensitive to furosemide, bumetanide, SITS, and DNDS.
