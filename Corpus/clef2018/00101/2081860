Acute pancreatitis and pregnancy. A recent case report. The authors report a case of acute pancreatitis occurring at the end of pregnancy. Pancreatitis and pregnancy in association with one another is a very serious condition. Research of the literature shows that the maternal mortality is 37% and the perinatal mortality 37.9%. These results mean that it is very important to make the diagnosis as early as possible and to work out the treatment to be given after the Caesarean operation so as to minimise the ill effects for the mother and the infant. The diagnosis is made by ultrasound of the abdomen and the levels of the amylase in the blood. It is possible to work out a correct management for these patients. The first priority is to deliver the fetus as soon as possible after the 34th week of amenorrhoea. The treatment should be multi-disciplinary and at the Caesarean there should be present an obstetrician, a surgeon who specialises in bowel conditions, a gastroenterologist and a neonatologist.
