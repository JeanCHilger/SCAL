Amylase and lipase detection in hemorrhaged animals treated with HBOC-201. HBOC-201 may alter lipase and amylase detection on chemistry analyzers using optical methods and affect pancreatic function after trauma. Amylase and lipase measurements were correlated against HBOC-201 to evaluate interference on samples spiked with 0-6g/dL HBOC-201. The detection threshold was 2.5g/dL or none when measured, respectively, on Vitros 250 or Advia 1650 instruments. Amylase and lipase from blood samples collected from 55% EBV hemorrhaged Yucatan min-pigs showed peaks around 24-48 hours. Amylase increase was not significant between treatments but lipase was higher in HBOC-201-treated animals. Animals particularly affected by the injury had elevated enzymes after hemorrhagic shock, without significant clinical consequences.
