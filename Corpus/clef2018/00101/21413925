Tyrosine kinase inhibitors, pancreatic hyperenzymemia and acute pancreatitis: a review. The advent of new drugs can rapidly increase the number of substances causing acute pancreatitis. This is the case of tyrosine kinase inhibitors these drugs are currently used for chronic myeloid leukemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, unresectable hepatocellular carcinomas and advanced renal cell carcinomas that and they have been reported to cause acute pancreatitis or asymptomatic elevations of serum pancreatic enzymes. Of the classes of drugs capable of inducing acute pancreatitis, we aimed to evaluate, in which class tyrosine kinase inhibitors can be allocated. A search was carried out using the MEDLINE database in order to select the data existing in the literature on pyrimidines and acute pancreatitis or serum lipase/amylase elevation covering the period from January 1966 to January 2010
