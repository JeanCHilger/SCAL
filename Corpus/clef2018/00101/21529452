Significance of trypsinogen activation peptides and interleukin-6 in experimental acute pancreatitis. To explore the feasibility of using plasma trypsinogen activation peptides (TAP) and serum interleukin-6(IL-6) as early markers for predicting the severity of experimental acute pancreatitis.Ninety male adult Sprague-Dawley rats were equally randomized into five groups: edema pancreatitis group, treated with retrograde ductal infusion of 3% sodium taurocholate solution necrosis pancreatitis group, treated with retrograde ductal infusion of 5% sodium taurocholate solutionAt 3 and 6 hours after infusion, plasma TAP concentration of necrosis pancreatitis group [(4.798±0.169) and (3.999±0.299)nmol/L, respectively]were significantly higher than those of edema pancreatitis group [(2.416±0.148) and (3.356±0.211)nmol/L, respectively] (P<0.01) at 6 hours after infusion, serum IL-6 level of necrosis pancreatitis group [(1339.51±56.43)pg/ml]was significantly higher than that of edema pancreatitis group [(619.07±42.25)pg/ml] (P<0.01).In this acute pancreatitis model, the peak levels of plasma TAP and serum IL-6 may appear earlier in rats with severer disease. Serum TAP level may be used as a marker for the accurate early prediction of the severity of acute pancreatitis.
