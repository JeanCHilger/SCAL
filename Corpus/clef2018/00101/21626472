Risk of hyperamylasemia and acute pancreatitis after double-balloon enteroscopy: a prospective study. There have been reports, mainly retrospective, of pancreatitis and hyperamylasemia after anterograde double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE). Our aim was to report the incidence of pancreatitis and hyperamylasemia after DBE and investigate possible risk factors associated with its occurrence.In this single-center prospective cohort study, serum samples were taken for amylase and lipase before and 3 hours after anterograde DBE in consecutive patients. Multiple variables were recorded, including total procedure time, insertion depth, and number of passes. Patients were evaluated to 24 hours later for signs of pancreatitis. The main outcome measures were the occurrence of hyperamylasemia and pancreatitis.92 patients were included in the analysis (58 women, 34 men mean age 54 years, range 18-89). The mean total procedure time was 62 minutes (range 30-120). The mean post-procedure amylase and lipase levels were significantly higher in comparison with the baseline levels (165 U/L vs. 69 U/L and 144 U/L vs. 28 U/L respectively, P<.05)The incidence of hyperamylasemia after anterograde DBE is common and particularly associated with longer procedure time and insertion depth. The cumulative incidence of pancreatitis was 3%. We recommend the avoidance of both unnecessarily lengthy procedures and deep insertion distances in patients who undergo anterograde DBE.
