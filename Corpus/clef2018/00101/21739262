Clinical study on the prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis by pancreatic duct stenting. Post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis (PEP) is one of the most common and serious complications of ERCP, which has become a major concern for digestive endoscopists. In the present study, we examine whether pancreatic duct stenting can reduce the incidence of PEP. Forty patients who underwent an ERCP in our hospital were selected according to their risk factors for PEP. They were randomly divided into two groups: (1) 20 subjects received a pancreatic duct stenting after ERCP to prevent pancreatitis (stent group, S) and (2) the other 20 subjects did not receive pancreatic duct stenting after ERCP (non-stent group, NS). Urine and serum amylase, and serum lipase were determined after the operation
