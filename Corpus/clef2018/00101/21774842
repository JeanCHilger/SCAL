Serum and pulmonary vascular endothelial growth factor/receptors and haemodynamic measurements in cyanotic congenital heart disease with decreased pulmonary blood flow. Tetralogy of Fallot is the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease with decreased pulmonary blood flow. Right-to-left shunt and infundibular pulmonary stenosis in this disease lead to a decrease in arterial O(2) saturation. Hypoxia is a strong stimulus for angiogenesis however, the reason for insufficiency in the pulmonary vascular growth in patients despite chronic arterial hypoxia is still not known. This study was planned considering that the impairment in vascular endothelial growth factor-receptor relationship or the vascular endothelial growth factor-receptor deficiency in the pulmonary vascular bed during development may cause insufficiency of pulmonary vascular growth. A total of 24 patients were grouped as cyanotic - including 13 patients with tetralogy of Fallot - and acyanotic - including 11 patients with left-to-right shunt lesions. During cardiac catheterisation, vascular endothelial growth factor measurements were performed
