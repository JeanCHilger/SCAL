Experimental studies of therapeutic effect of Rheum officinale on acute pancreatitis. To investigate the therapeutic effect of Rheum offÄ©cinale on acute pancreatitis.Buffered sodium taurocholate (3% m/V) was injected into the pancreatico-biliary duct to induce acute pancreatitis. Death rate,coefficient of pancreas, serum amylyse (AMY), hemocuprein (SOD), TNF-alpha and IL-1beta level were examined at 6, 12 and 24 hours after operations. Pathology analysis were also obtained.Compared with corresponding pancreatitis groups,death rate, coefficient of pancreas, serum TNF-alpha and IL-1beta level of drug groups decreased remarkably (P < 0.05), while serum SOD level significantly increased (P < 0.01). Serum AMY level of drug groups increased at 6 h (P < 0.01), decreased at 12 h (P < 0.01) and had no statistics disparity at 24 h (P > 0.05) compared with respective pancreatitis group. Although score points of all drug groups were lower than corresponding pancreatitis groups, the growth tendency of both were similar.Rheum officinale Baill has the effect of prevention to pancreas pathological changes in the animal pattern, but not able to reverse the tendency.
