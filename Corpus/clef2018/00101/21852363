Assessment of the protective effects of oral tocotrienols in arginine chronic-like pancreatitis. Tocotrienols exhibit anti-inflammatory properties over macrophages and promote cytotoxicity in activated pancreatic stellate cells, suggesting that they may limit chronic pancreatitis progression. We aimed to quantitate the effect of oral tocotrienols on a rat model of chronic pancreatic injury. Chronic-like pancreatitis was induced by repeated arginine pancreatitis. Palm oil tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) was given by gavage before and after pancreatitis inductions. Amylase and hydroxyproline were determined in pancreatic homogenates collagen, fibronectin, α-smooth muscle actin (SMA), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and phosphorylated Smad3 were assessed by Western blotting. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 was measured in plasma. Morphological assessment included light microscopy, fibrosis area fraction, and collagen network fractal analysis. Arginine pancreatitis induced pancreatic atrophy and increased hydroxyproline that ameliorated after TRF. Arginine increased TGF-β1 (185 ± 40 vs. 15 ± 2 ng/ml
