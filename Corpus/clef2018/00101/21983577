Prediction of acute biliary pancreatitis. Authors propose mathematical model for prediction of acute biliary pancreatitis in patients with strangulated concrements of papilla Vateri. Values of α-amylase and lipase in blood and bile are used as main prognostic signs. It is estimated that blood lipase, bile α-amylase and lipase are main prognostic signs for development of acute biliary pancreatitis.
