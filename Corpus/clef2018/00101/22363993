Chronic pancreatitis: microbe-intestinal tissue complex and systemic inflammatory response. Today in Russian Federation, we observe significant growth of the chronic pancreatitis incidence with the depression of its therapy efficiency (more than 20% of the patients) and complications rate growth. In many respects given tendency is associated with the inefficiency of traditional medications combination in the context of inflammation process reduction, gut dysbiosis correction and chronic inflammation reaction depression. Present-day studies indicates, that the grade and character of inflammation in the pancreas depends on the pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines balance, which is associated with the elevation of the pathogenic microbiota concentration and permeability of the gut. We estimate clinical efficacy of complex treatment regimen (PPI, spasmolytic, multienzyme and prebiotic therapy) in the patients with chronic pancreatitis and its effect on chronic system inflammation. We established that efficacy of modern complex treatment regimen depends on its influence on chronic system inflammation and that prebiotics addition potentiates correction of dysbiotic changes in the gut microbial-tissular complex and reduces grade of system inflammation.
