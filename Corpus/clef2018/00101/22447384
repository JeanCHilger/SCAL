Short-term result of ductus arteriosus stent implantation compared with surgically created shunts. This report aims to compare the researchers' early experience with the safety, efficacy, short-term outcomes, and complications of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) stents in neonates having duct-dependent pulmonary circulation with those of surgically created shunts. Between April 2009 and April 2011, 18 infants with duct-dependent pulmonary circulation underwent cardiac catheterization for PDA stenting as the first palliative procedure in a referral center. For comparison, 20 infants who underwent surgical aortopulmonary shunt placement in another center were used. Follow-up assessment included clinical examination, echocardiography, oxygen saturation, and cardiac catheterization studies. Access and stenting for the PDA were successful in 15 patients (83.3 %). The mean procedure time was 58.43 ± 41.25 min, and the mean fluoroscopy time was 18.81 ± 5.64 min. Three patients (20 %) in the stented group and 6 patients (30 %) in the surgical group died (P = 0.09). After a 6-month follow-up period, none of the patients had significant stent stenosis requiring reintervention. The oxygen saturation increase did not differ significantly between the two groups either immediately after the procedure or 6 months later (P > 0.5). The left pulmonary artery diameter, McGoon ratio, and Nakata index did not differ significantly between the two groups (P > 0.05), but the right pulmonary diameter was larger in the stented group (5.01 ± 0.45 vs 4.1 ± 0.49 mm P = 0.0001). Stenting for the PDA is an appropriate alternative to surgical shunt creation in many patients with duct-dependent circulation. In our sample, the two groups did not differ significantly in terms of outcome or mortality.
