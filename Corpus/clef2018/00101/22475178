Pulse oximetry home monitoring in infants with single-ventricle physiology and a surgical shunt as the only source of pulmonary blood flow. Shunt occlusion is a major cause of death in children with single ventricle. We evaluated whether one daily measurement of oxygen saturation at home could detect life-threatening shunt dysfunction.A total of 28 infants were included. Parents were instructed to measure saturation once daily and if less than or equal to 70% repeat the measurement. Home monitoring was defined as positive when a patient was admitted to Queen Silvia Children's Hospital because of saturation less than or equal to 70% on repeated measurement at home. A shunt complication was defined as arterial desaturation and a narrowing of the shunt that resulted in an intervention to relieve the obstruction or in death. Parents' attitude towards the method was investigated using a questionnaire.A shunt complication occurred out of hospital eight times in eight patients. Home monitoring was positive in five out of eight patients. In two patients, home monitoring was probably life saving in one of them, the shunt was replaced the same day and the other had an emergency balloon dilatation of the shunt. In three out of eight patients, home monitoring was negativeHome monitoring of oxygen saturation has the potential to detect some of the life-threatening shunt obstructions between stages I and II in infants with single-ventricle physiology.
