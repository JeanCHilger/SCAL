Early proteome analysis of rat pancreatic acinar AR42J cells treated with taurolithocholic acid 3-sulfate. Bile acids are the initiating factors of biliary acute pancreatitis. Bile acids can induce the activation of intracellular zymogen, thus leading injury in pancreatic acinar cells. Pathological zymogen activation in pancreatic acinar cells is a common feature of all types of acute pancreatitis. The proteins expressed in pancreatic acinar cells during the activation of zymogen may determine the severity of acute pancreatitis. The present study aims to determine the differentially expressed proteins in taurolithocholic acid 3-sulfate-stimulated pancreatic acinar cells as an in vitro model for acute pancreatitis.Rat pancreatic acinar AR42J cells were treated with taurolithocholic acid 3-sulfate for 20 min. Laser confocal scanning microscopy and flow cytometry were used to detect activated trypsinogen in pancreatic acinar AR42J cells. After the determination of trypsinogen activation, proteome analysis was performed to identify the proteins differentially expressed in taurolithocholic acid 3-sulfate-treated cells and non-treated cells.After treatment with taurolithocholic acid 3-sulfate for 20 min, the activation of trypsinogen in AR42J cells was concurrent with changes in the protein expression profile. Thirty-nine differentially expressed proteins were detected among these, 23 proteins were up-regulated and 16 proteins were down-regulated. KEGG analysis indicated that these proteins are involved in cellular metabolic pathways, cellular defensive mechanisms, intracellular calcium regulation and cytoskeletal changes.The expression of proteins in the pancreatic acinar cell changes at the early stage of biliary acute pancreatitis. These differentially expressed proteins will provide valuable information to understand the pathophysiologic mechanism biliary acute pancreatitis and may be useful for prognostic indices of acute pancreatitis.
