Prophylactic temporary 3F pancreatic duct stent to prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis in patients with a difficult biliary cannulation: a multicenter, prospective, randomized study. Post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP) is the most common and serious complication of ERCP. Difficult biliary cannulation can be a procedure-related risk factor for PEP. Recent studies reported that a prophylactic pancreatic stent (PS) can reduce the frequency and severity of PEP.To evaluate the efficacy and usefulness of a temporary 3F PS to prevent PEP in patients with difficult biliary cannulations.A multicenter, prospective, randomized study.Two tertiary-care academic medical centers.In total, 101 patients with a difficult biliary cannulation were randomly divided into the 3F PS placement group (PS group, n = 50) or the nonstent (NS) group (NS group, n = 51).Endoscopic placement of a 3F unflanged PS.The incidence and severity of PEP in the 2 groups, spontaneous dislodgment of stents, and procedure-related complications.The technical success rate of 3F PS placement was 96% (48/50). The lengths of the stents were 4 cm (n = 21), 6 cm (n = 15), and 8 cm (n = 12). Spontaneous stent dislodgment within 7 days occurred in 94% of patients (45/48). The mean duration until spontaneous dislodgment was 3.5 days. The incidence rate of PEP was 12% (6/50: mild, 5 moderate, 1) in the PS group and 29.4% (15/51: mild, 12No comparative results for stent size and diameter and a low-risk cohort group.Prophylactic temporary 3F PS placement in patients with a difficult biliary cannulation during ERCP seems to be a safe and effective method for reducing PEP and results in a high rate of spontaneous passage of stents without complications.
