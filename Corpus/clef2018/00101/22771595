Effects of infliximab on bacterial translocation in experimental acute necrotizing pancreatitis. Translocation of bacteria from the gut is an important factor in the development of septic complications and mortality in acute pancreatitis (AP). The present study was designed to assess the effects of infliximab treatment on bacterial translocation (BT) in experimental acute necrotizing pancreatitis.Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=45) were allocated into three groups. AP was induced in group II (positive control, n=15) and group III (Infliximab n=15) by retrograde injection of taurocholate into the common biliopancreatic duct. Group I rats (ShamOedema, acinar cell necrosis, inflammatory infiltration, haemorrhage, fat necrosis and perivascular inflammation in group III rats were decreased with infliximab treatment when compared with group II (P<0.001). BT to mesentery lymph node in groups I, II and III were 20, 100 and 46 per cent, respectively. BT to peritoneum and pancreas in group III was lower than group II (P<0.05).Infliximab administration resulted in beneficial effects on BT and histopathologic changes in the experimental necrotizing pancreatitis. Whether anti-TNF therapy has a role in prevention of complications of ANP needs to be established.
