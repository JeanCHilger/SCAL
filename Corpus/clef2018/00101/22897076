Tigecycline-induced acute pancreatitis: about two cases and review of the literature. Tigecycline (formerly CAR-936, Tygacyl) is the first glycylcycline antibiotic available for clinical use. It has an expanded broad-spectrum antibiotic activity. Phase III studies have identified gastrointestinal side-effects, especially nausea and vomiting, as the most common adverse events. Few cases of acute pancreatitis (AP) have been described in the literature. We report two new cases of mild tigecycline-induced pancreatitis. Tigecycline was given for soft-tissue infection in both cases. Symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and mostly abdominal pain occurred within 5 days after starting Tigecycline. Pancreatic enzymes elevation occurred five to six days after initiation of treatment, and resolved within a week after drug-discontinuation. Diagnosis of mild pancreatitis was confirmed after performing CT-Scan of the abdomen in both cases. We take this opportunity to review the literature about this potentially serious side-effect induced by tigecycline.
