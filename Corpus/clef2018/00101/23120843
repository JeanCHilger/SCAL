Acute childhood pancreatitis caused by valproate. Signs of pancreatitis in children are simmilar to those in adults: disturbed general condition, abdominal pain, vomitting, elevated amylase level. Mainstays in intensive therapy and indications for surgical interventions are also sim-milar. Contrary to adults, in childhood pancreatitis adverse effects of various drugs are common causes. Natrium valproate, antiepileptic drug in use for many years, can rarely induce pancreatitis. We report of such case in a girl treated with valproate for Rett's syndrome. Abdominal ultrasound can be unspecific in acute pancreatitis. If clinical signs and amylases elevated in a child on valproate therapy do not suffice, abdominal computer tomography should be done to confirm the grounded suspicion.
