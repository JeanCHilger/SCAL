Diagnosis of membrane disorders in acute pancreatitis. In 110 patients with acute pancreatitis the authors studied the activity of intracellular enzymes in the blood (LDH, CPC, ALaT, ASaT, transamidinase) in a complex with indices characterizing the condition of the membrane cell systems, in particular: activity of acid phosphatase, content of 17-ketosteroids, activity of plasma chemiluminescence, concentration of beta-lipoproteins in blood. Complex study of these indices makes it possible to make a sufficiently objective judgement of the severity of the membrane disorders in acute pancreatitis and verity the form and control the treatment of the disease.
