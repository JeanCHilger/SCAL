Preservation of the metabolic rate of oxygen in preterm infants during indomethacin therapy for closure of the ductus arteriosus. The aim of this study was to assess and quantify the effects of indomethacin on cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) in preterm infants undergoing treatment for a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA).CBF and CMRO2 were measured before and after the first dose of a 3-d course of indomethacin to close hemodynamically significant PDA in preterm neonates. Indocyanine-green (ICG) concentration curves were acquired before and after indomethacin injection to quantify CBF and CMRO2.Eight preterm neonates (gestational age, 27.6 ± 0.5 wk birth weight, 992 ± 109 gIndomethacin resulted in significant reduction in CBF but did not alter CMRO2 because of a compensatory increase in OEF.
