Time-resolved immunofluorometric assays for trypsinogen-1 and 2 in serum reveal preferential elevation of trypsinogen-2 in pancreatitis. We have developed sensitive time-resolved immunofluorometric assays for the two trypsinogen isoenzymes, trypsinogen-1 and trypsinogen-2, which also are called cationic and anionic trypsinogen, respectively. The assays use monoclonal antibodies produced by immunization with tumor-associated trypsinogen that is isolated from mucinous ovarian cyst fluid. In each assay, one antibody is immobilized onto the walls of polystyrene microtiter strip wells and the other is labeled with an europium(III) chelate. The cross-reaction of each trypsinogen isoenzyme in the assay for the other isoenzyme is less than 1%. The detection limits are 0.1 micrograms/L for trypsinogen-1 and 0.3 micrograms/L for trypsinogen-2. In sera of healthy subjects and patients with extrapancreatic disease the concentration of trypsinogen-1 is higher (median, 21 micrograms/L) than that of trypsinogen-2 (median, 17 micrograms/L), but in acute pancreatitis the ratio is reversed. In acute pancreatitis the concentration of trypsinogen-2 is 50-fold higher than in controls, whereas the difference in trypsinogen-1 concentrations is only 15-fold. The corresponding difference in immunoreactive trypsin measured by a commercially available radioimmunoassay was also only 10-fold.
