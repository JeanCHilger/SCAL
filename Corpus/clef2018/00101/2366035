Both ethanol consumption and protein deficiency increase the fragility of pancreatic lysosomes. Both ethanol abuse and protein deficiency result in pancreatic injury. Moreover, these two variables frequently coexist. As lysosomal enzymes may play a role in the initiation of pancreatic injury, the aim of this study was to determine the effects of ethanol consumption and protein deficiency on pancreatic lysosomal stability. For 3 weeks, male Sprague-Dawley rats were match-fed (in groups of four) isocaloric amounts of one of the following liquid diets: (1) protein-sufficient diet, (2) protein-sufficient diet containing ethanol as 36% of the total energy, (3) protein-deficient diet, and (4) protein-deficient diet containing ethanol as 36% of energy. Pancreatic lysosomal stability was assessed by determining (a) latency, as indicated by the percentage increase in lysosomal enzyme activity in pancreatic homogenate induced by Triton X-100, and (b) by the percentage of lysosomal enzyme remaining in the supernatant after sedimentation of the lysosomal pellet from the pancreatic homogenate. Protein deficiency was associated with a decrease in latency and an increase in supernatant enzyme. Ethanol administration was associated with a decreased latency. Both protein-deficient and ethanol-fed animals exhibited higher pancreatic activities of cathepsin B, a lysosomal protease capable of activating trypsinogen. In addition, protein-deficient animals exhibited higher pancreatic activities of acid phosphatase, N-acetyl-glucosaminidase, and beta-glucuronidase. As lysosomal enzymes are postulated to play a role in the initiation of pancreatitis, these results suggest that ethanol consumption and protein deficiency may at least partly exert their toxic effects on the pancreas by altering pancreatic lysosomal stability and increasing the glandular content of cathepsin B.
