Correlation of fibrinogen-like protein 2 with progression of acute pancreatitis in rats. To examine fibrinogen-like protein 2 (fgl2) expression during taurocholate-induced acute pancreatitis progression in rats and its correlation with pancreatic injury severity.Forty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into the severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) group (n = 24) and the sham operation (SO) group (n = 24). Sodium taurocholate (4% at doses of 1 mL/kg body weight) was retrogradely injected into the biliopancreatic ducts of the rats to induce SAP. Pancreatic tissues were prepared immediately after sacrifice. At the time of sacrifice, blood was obtained for determination of serum amylase activity and isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Pancreatic tissue specimens were obtained for routine light microscopy including hematoxylin and eosin staining, and the severity of pancreatic injury was evaluated 1, 4 and 8 h after induction. Expression of fgl2 mRNA was measured in the pancreas and PBMCs using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Expression of fgl2 protein was evaluated in pancreatic tissues using Western blotting and immunohistochemical staining. Masson staining was also performed to observe microthrombosis.At each time point, levels of fgl2 mRNAs in pancreatic tissues and PBMCs were higher (P < 0.05) in the SAP group than in the SO group. For pancreatic tissue in SAP vs SO, the levels were: after 1 h, 3.911 ± 1.277 vs 1.000 ± 0.673 after 4 h, 9.850 ± 3.095 vs 1.136 ± 0.609Microthrombosis due to fgl2 overexpression contributes to pancreatic impairment in rats with SAP, and fgl2 level may serve as a biomarker during early stages of disease.
