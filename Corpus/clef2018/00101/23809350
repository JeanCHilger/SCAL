Global perfusion assessment and tissue oxygen saturation in preterm infants: where are we? Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) monitoring is a new challenge for clinicians who deal with early detection of dangerous hypoperfusion in the brain, as well as in splanchnic and renal districts in critically ill preterm infants. Previous studies performed on infants and children with congenital heart disease, demonstrated the efficacy of this non-invasive method in managing hypoperfusive states pre, post and during cardiac surgery. Its use has improved post surgery outcome. NIRS monitoring has been used also to assess therapeutic intervention utility. Early identification of silent hypoperfusion has made NIRS use in preterm infants very interesting for neonatologists, especially where other techniques have failed. In this work, literature on this topic has been carefully examined, particularly the "two site NIRS" use in preterm infants, to evaluate how regional splanchnic oxygen saturation changes, both in physiological events, such as enteral feeding and in hemodynamic disorders, that occur in patients with significant patent ductus and in hypoperfusive states that lead to necrotizing enterocolitis.
