Obstructive ileus and acute pancreatitis. A 48-year-old patient presented with a 24 hour history of diffuse abdominal pain and diarrhea. Based on elevated serum amylase and lipase levels, a CT-scan, and a history of chronic alcohol intake, acute alcoholic pancreatitis was diagnosed. The patient clinically improved under conservative therapy, but after restarting enteral nutrition on the fourth day, he developed full blown mechanical ileus. Intraoperatively, an adhesive band and acute edematous pancreatitis and fat necrosis was found. Retrospectively, the initial clinical symptoms and plain abdominal x-ray findings suggest coincidence of obstructive ileus and acute pancreatitis. We hypothesize that obstructive ileus had triggered pancreatitis.
