Demonstration of pancreatic parenchyma by digital subtraction techniques during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. This paper reports the feasibility of using digital subtraction angiography techniques during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography to obtain greater detail of pancreatic structure. The pancreatic duct was filled in 23 of 27 cases attempted and in 17 cases parenchymal detail was obtained. Filling defects due to neoplasm were clearly defined and the changes of chronic pancreatitis visualised. The technique seems valuable for small lesions but may carry a higher risk of producing pancreatitis.
