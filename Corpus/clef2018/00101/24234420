Chemopreventive effects of resveratrol in a rat model of cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis. In the past decades, a greater understanding of acute pancreatitis has led to improvement in mortality rates. Nevertheless, this disease continues to be a health care system problem due to its economical costs. Future strategies such as antioxidant supplementation could be very promising, regarding to beginning and progression of the disease. For this reason, this study was aimed at assessing the effect of exogenous administration of resveratrol during the induction process of acute pancreatitis caused by the cholecystokinin analog cerulein in rats. Resveratrol pretreatment reduced histological damage induced by cerulein treatment, as well as hyperamylasemia and hyperlipidemia. Altered levels of corticosterone, total antioxidant status, and glutathione peroxidase were significantly reverted to control levels by the administration of resveratrol. Lipid peroxidation was also counteracted nevertheless, superoxide dismutase enzyme was overexpressed due to resveratrol pretreatment. Related to immune response, resveratrol pretreatment reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1Î² levels and increased anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 levels. In addition, pretreatment with resveratrol in cerulein-induced pancreatitis rats was able to reverse, at least partially, the abnormal calcium signal induced by treatment with cerulein. In conclusion, this study confirms antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties of resveratrol as chemopreventive in cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis.
