Near-infrared spectroscopy: exposing the dark (venous) side of the circulation. The safety of anesthesia has improved greatly in the past three decades. Standard perioperative monitoring, including pulse oximetry, has practically eliminated unrecognized arterial hypoxia as a cause for perioperative injury. However, most anesthesia-related cardiac arrests in children are now cardiovascular in origin, and standard monitoring is unable to detect many circulatory abnormalities. Near-infrared spectroscopy provides noninvasive continuous access to the venous side of regional circulations that can approximate organ-specific and global measures to facilitate the detection of circulatory abnormalities and drive goal-directed interventions to reduce end-organ ischemic injury.
