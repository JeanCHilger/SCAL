Early murine polymicrobial sepsis predominantly causes renal injury. Multiple organ failure in sepsis substantially increases mortality. This study examined if there was greater hepatic, pancreatic, splenic, or renal injury in mice that would die during sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) compared with that of those that would survive. Mice were stratified into groups predicted to die (Die-P) or predicted to live (Live-P) in the first 5 days after CLP based on plasma interleukin 6 levels. Groups were sacrificed to harvest organs for histology. Separate animals were followed for survival with daily blood sampling to examine renal function. No significant histological evidence of organ injury was observed in either the Live-P or Die-P mice. Minimal hepatic injury occurred as plasma aspartate transaminase demonstrated less than a 2-fold increase over normal in both groups. In addition, pancreatic injury was minimal as there was also less than a 2-fold increase in plasma amylase levels. In contrast, blood urea nitrogen levels were nearly five times higher within 24 h in Die-P mice compared with those of mice predicted to live. Mice with blood urea nitrogen levels higher than 44 mg/dL had a 17.6 higher relative risk of dying (95% confidence interval, 4.5-69.4). Cystatin C, a more specific kidney function biomarker, was also elevated at 24 h after CLP. When the cystatin C levels were analyzed relative to the hours before death, rather than hours after CLP, they were also significantly increased in mice Dead by day 5 compared with those Alive after day 5. We conclude that limited liver, pancreas, and spleen injury develops during murine CLP-induced sepsis while significant kidney injury is present. The renal injury becomes worse closer to death.
