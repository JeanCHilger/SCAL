The lung lysosomal hydrolases and phospholipase A in acute experimental pancreatitis with reference to heparin treatment. The pulmonary complications are severe sequeles of acute pancreatitis. The pathogenesis of these complications is unsolved. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the status of lung lysosomes and phospholipase A activity in acute experimental pancreatitis (AEP) and the effect of heparin as a potentially protective agent. Taurocholate-induced AEP in rats lasting 24 and 48 hours was treated with heparin intraperitoneally (2 mg/kg every 8 hours). The total activity of cathepsins and B-glucuronidase in lysosomal enriched subfraction increased markedly during 48 hours of AEP in untreated animals, but the relative free activity was maximal after 24 hours. Free activity of cathepsins and acid phosphatase in supernatant was maximal after 24 hours. The phospholipase A activity was maximally elevated (more than twofold) after 48 hours. Heparin prevented the increase of activity of B-glucuronidase, depressed the relative free activity of all investigated lysosomal hydrolases and inhibited the phospholipase A activity in the lung homogenate. Our results indicate the significance of labilization of lung lysosomes and increment of phospholipase A activity in the lungs in the damage of this organ during AEP in the rats, and suggest the beneficial effect of heparin on these factors.
