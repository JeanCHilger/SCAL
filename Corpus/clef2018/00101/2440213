The effect of fat-rich diet and chronic ethanol ingestion on ascitic fluid and plasma enzyme activities in acute pancreatitis in rats. The effect of fat-rich diet (F) and chronic ethanol ingestion in experimental acute pancreatitis (AP) on plasma enzyme activities and the composition of ascitic fluid were studied in rats. 96 male Wistar rats were randomized into four groups. Two groups, one of which drank 15% (v/v) ethanol as their drinking solution, received the F-diet for 12 weeks. The rest of the rats served as controls receiving standard laboratory food (S). Half of the control animals drank ethanol and the other rats had tap water. AP was induced by retrograde bile infusion into the pancreatic ducts and relaparotomy performed after 24 hours follow-up period. All animals surviving were exsanguinated and the ascitic fluid collected. Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) correlated with the mortality rate in the S-diet receiving groups but no changes could be seen after the F-diet. Ethanol in combination with the F-diet caused a significant increase in total protein content of ascitic fluids (p less than 0.001). Trypsin inhibiting capacity was significantly decreased in the same groups (p less than 0.01) and total proteolytic activity was highest in the ascitic fluids of the F-diet and ethanol receiving rats. No significant differences in the PLA2 activities in the ascitic fluids between the groups were observed. It is suggested, that the composition of ascitic fluid generated during experimental AP is of importance to the outcome of the disease.
