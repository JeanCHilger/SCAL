Digestive enzymes and protease inhibitors in plasma from patients with acute pancreatitis. The plasma levels of certain digestive enzymes and protease inhibitors were determined in 40 patients with severe acute pancreatitis diagnosed as gallstone-induced (GP), alcoholic (AP), or idiopathic (IP). On admission, plasma levels of amylase and immunoreactive cationic trypsin(ogen) (IRCT) and elastase 2 (IRE 2) were found to be 50 +/- 10 ng/ml, 340 +/- 64 ng/ml, and 190 +/- 15 ng/ml, respectively, in all groups of patients. These enzymes levels remained high for the first 2 days following hospitalization and then decreased, although amylase and IRCT levels remained elevated above normal values throughout the study period (2 weeks). In general amylase and IRCT were lower in patients with concomitant ascites, pancreatic pseudocysts, or abscesses, and higher in patients who died, as compared to the pancreatitis group as a whole. In these patients, levels of immunoreactive alpha 1-protease inhibitor (alpha 1-PI) and alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2-M) remained relatively constant at the lower end of the normal range throughout the study period. Inhibitor levels in plasma were unaffected by the etiology of pancreatitis or the occurrence of complications. A similar trend was seen with plasma levels of lysosomal hydrolases. The results indicate that in this group of patients, plasma levels of pancreatic digestive enzymes were reflective of the clinical features and severity of the disease, as well as the time following the acute attack that brought the patient to the hospital.
