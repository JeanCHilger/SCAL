Risk factors for acute pancreatitis in patients with severe motor and intellectual disabilities. Acute pancreatitis in patients with severe motor and intellectual disability (SMID) is a rare but life-threatening condition. Possible causes of acute pancreatitis in these patients including valproic acid therapy, hypothermia and nasoduodenal tube feeding, have not yet been investigated in detail. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the risk factors for acute pancreatitis in patients with SMID.Five SMID patients with acute pancreatitis and 15 SMID patients without acute pancreatitis were reviewed. Age serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, total protein, and albuminA statistically significant difference was observed in serum albumin level between the two groups (P = 0.026).The mechanism of acute pancreatitis in these patients was considered as pancreatic morphological change, acinar damage, and elevated serum trypsinogen level caused by malnutrition. It is likely that acute pancreatitis in patients with SMID occurs due to the same mechanism as in anorexia nervosa and malnourished patients. To prevent acute pancreatitis in these patients, it is important to maintain adequate nutritional status.
