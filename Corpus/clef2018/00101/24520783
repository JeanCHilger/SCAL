Effect of Qingyi Chengqi Decoction on severe acute pancreatitis patients: a clinical study. To observe the change of intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) patients, and to study the effect of Qingyi Chengqi Decoction (QCD) on it.Eighty-six SAP patients from Department of General Surgery and Department of Digestive Diseases, Qingyang People's Hospital, Gansu Province, who were in line with diagnosis standard of SAP, were assigned to the treatment group (44 cases) and the control group (42 cases) from March 2012 to May 2013. All patients received routine Western medicine. Those in the treatment group took QCD additionally. Main clinical symptoms and APACHE II were observed. The serum levels of amylase (AMY), C-reactive protein (CRP), and IAP were examined. The incidence of secondary infection rate (SIR), drainage rate (percutaneous catheter drainage and operation), mortality, and mean days in ward were also recorded.Main clinical symptoms were significantly improved in the treatment group. APACHE II score, serum levels of AMY, CRP, and IAP obviously decreased in the treatment group. The incidence of SIR, drainage rate, and the mortality were also significantly lower in the treatment group than in the control group. The mean days in ward were also markedly shortened (P < 0.01).QCD could relieve inflammatory response, lower IAP, SIR, and mortality, increase the curative rate and improve the prognosis of SAP.
