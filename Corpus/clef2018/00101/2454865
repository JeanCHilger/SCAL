Postoperative pancreatitis, hyperamylasemia and amylase isoenzymes after parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism. Recent studies have cast doubt on the concept of causative association between parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism and postoperative pancreatitis. The present study indicated that the relationship was real and that the development of acute pancreatitis after parathyroid surgery was not purely incidental. Acute pancreatitis was observed postoperatively in 3 p. 100 of cases after parathyroidectomy (6/196 cases), in 37 p. 100 after pancreatic surgery (19/51 cases), but never after thyroidectomy (100 cases) or other extra-abdominal operations (100 cases). During the first five postoperative days, the incidence of hyperamylasemia was 16 p. 100 after parathyroidectomy, 47 p. 100 after pancreatic surgery, 3 p. 100 after thyroidectomy, 2 p. 100 after other extra-abdominal operations. During the same period, the frequency of hyperlipasemia was similar: 20 p. 100 after parathyroidectomy, 54 p. 100 after pancreatic surgery, 1 p. 100 after thyroidectomy, 0 p. 100 after other extra-abdominal operations. In all cases with hyperamylasemia after parathyroidectomy, the pancreatic fractions of amylase isoenzymes were abnormally elevated.
