Deaths from acute pancreatitis: why do we miss the diagnosis so frequently? Review of acute pancreatitis deaths between 1974 and 1984 revealed 126 patients, 53 (42%) of whom were first diagnosed at autopsy. Pancreatitis was undiagnosed in life in 13 (33%) of the patients with a gallstone aetiology, 8 (40%) of those with an alcohol aetiology, 21 (42%) of those of unknown aetiology and 17 (74%) of those with pancreatitis due to other identified aetiological factors. These patients more commonly died within the first week of their illness, more often had significant underlying medical disease and tended to have less severe degrees of pancreatic parenchymal destruction. Only 7 (13%) of the 53 patients undiagnosed in life had presented with abdominal pain. The majority (68%) presented atypically with known or suspected medical conditions, often to internists, or post-operatively (19%). Failure to diagnose these patients in life was most often due to a lack of consideration of the diagnosis, usually because of the atypical presentation, and consequent omission of an amylase determination--made in only 5 (9%) of the patients.
