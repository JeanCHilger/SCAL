Lipid-associated total parenteral nutrition in patients with severe acute pancreatitis. Biochemical data were studied in 18 patients with severe acute pancreatitis receiving lipid associated with total parenteral nutrition. The mean nonprotein energy intake was 30 kcal/kg/day, with 34-70% of the nonprotein calories as lipid. These parameters were no different between patients who survived and those who died. The mean sum of Ranson criteria was significantly higher in patients who died as compared with those who survived. Plasma triglycerides, glucose, albumin, and the amount of insulin supplementation were related to the severity of the disease and to the outcome. Persistent hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia, hypoalbuminemia, and higher insulin requirements were observed in patients who died in comparison with those who survived and this appeared to be an index of fatal outcome. These abnormalities reflect in part an inability to utilize nonprotein energy, because the measured energy expenditure in relation to intake was lower in the patients who died, despite comparable intakes and expected energy expenditures.
