The ability of current scoring systems in differentiating transient and persistent organ failure in patients with acute pancreatitis. The purpose of this study is to investigate the accuracy of currently used scoring systems in differentiating transient and persistent organ failure in patients with acute pancreatitis (AP).In this retrospective study, 127 consecutive patients with AP and organ failure were included. Patients were divided into transient and persistent organ failure groups. The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Examination II score, bedside index of severity in acute pancreatitis, harmless acute pancreatitis score, and modified Marshall scores within the first 24 hours of organ failure were collected, and their accuracy in predicting transient organ failure was assessed.Transient organ failure occurred in 46 patients (36.2%). Fewer patients with transient organ failure initiated with multiple organ failure (13.0% vs 37.0%, P=.004) and renal failure (17.4% vs 44.4%, P=.002). In predicting transient organ failure, the area under the curves of the 4 scoring systems is from 0.66 to 0.71. The area under the curve of serum amylase was 0.78, which was slightly better than that of the modified Marshall and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Examination II score and was significantly better than that of the bedside index of severity in acute pancreatitis and harmless acute pancreatitis score (P<.05).Current scoring systems are not accurate enough in differentiating transient and persistent organ failure in patients with AP.
