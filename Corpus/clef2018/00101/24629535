Acute, severe pancreatitis in a 13-year-old girl. Acute pancreatitis is uncommon in children and the spectrum of etiologies is broader than in adults. Here we describe a case of acute, severe gallstone pancreatitis in an obese, 13-year-old girl presenting with upper abdominal pain and markedly elevated levels of amylase and transaminases. Abdominal ultrasound showed cholelithiasis and dilatation of the common bile duct and an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with papillotomy was performed. The girl was discharged for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
