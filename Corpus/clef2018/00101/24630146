Observational study of intra-abdominal pressure monitoring in acute pancreatitis. Intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) is predictive of adverse outcome in critically ill patients however, its role in acute pancreatitis is unclear, and prospective studies are lacking. We aimed to determine the overall incidence and predictive value of IAH on mortality in acute pancreatitis.Transvesical IAP was measured on admission and every 4 hours within high-dependency unit/intensive care unit. Serum biochemistry and physiologic parameters permitted calculation of Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, Imrie, and Ranson scores. The primary end point was 30-day mortality.A total of 218 patients with acute pancreatitis were recruited 30-day mortality was greater in patients with IAH (IAP â‰¥12 mmHgIAP is a good predictor of mortality and organ failure in acute pancreatitis and compares favorably with other validated prognostic scores. Whether IAH is a phenomenon causative of organ failure or an epiphenomenon, occurring in conjunction with other organ dysfunction, remains unclear.
