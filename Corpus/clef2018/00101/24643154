Double outlet right ventricle with intact ventricular septum. Double outlet right ventricle is a cardiac malformation in which both the aorta and pulmonary artery arise from the right ventricle. A double outlet right ventricle with intact ventricular septum is extremely rare. A nine-day-old boy born at 38 weeks with a birth weight of 3200 g was referred due to cyanosis and murmur. The history of the patient was nonsignificant. On the physical examination, oxygen saturation of the patient on room air was 84%, and cardiac activity and a 2/6 systolic murmur at the right sternal border were found. On electrocardiography, deep q's were determined in D2, D3, and aVF. On echocardiography, left atrial isomerism, dextrocardia, wide, high venosum atrial septal defect, double outlet right ventricle with intact ventricular septum, malposition of the great arteries, and moderate pulmonary stenosis were observed. Catheter angiography was performed for diagnostic confirmation. Herein, a newborn with cyanosis and murmur diagnosed as double outlet right ventricle with intact ventricular septum is reported.
