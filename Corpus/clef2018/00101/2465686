Prevention of the spread of experimental acute pancreatitis by intraductal administration of a synthetic protease inhibitor in dogs. The effect of a synthetic protease inhibitor, gabexate mesilate (GM), which was administered directly into the pancreatic duct, on acute pancreatitis induced by sodium taurocholate in dogs was investigated. Intraductal administration of GM significantly inhibited intrapancreatic trypsin activity at 24 h, compared with the control. The survival rate 10 days after initiation of pancreatitis for the group in which GM was administered intraductally was 100%, whereas that for the control group was 25%. Serial blood biochemical analysis and histopathological findings suggested that the progress of pancreatitis was favorably influenced by intraductal administration of GM.
