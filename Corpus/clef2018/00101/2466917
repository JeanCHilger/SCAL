Failure of somatostatin or an analog to promote closure of end pancreatic fistulae. Somatostatin has been reported to promote closure of pancreatic fistulae, but use of the analog SMS 201-995 (Sandoz, Inc.) has not previously been published. We used this analog to treat two patients with end pancreatic fistulae refractory to conventional therapy. One patient had disruption of a pancreaticojejunostomy after pancreaticoduodenectomy and the other had acute necrotizing gallstone pancreatitis and disruption of the pancreatic duct in the tail. SMS 201-995 (100-150 micrograms/d) abruptly decreased fistula output by 50% in both patients but further increases in dosage had no further effect on output. Neither fistula healed after 3-4 wk of therapy. Treatment with somatostatin or its analogs alone will not lead to closure of a pancreatic fistula complicated by factors such as distal obstruction, infection, or foreign body. Somatostatin may promote closure of lateral fistulae and may simplify the management of patients with high output fistulae.
