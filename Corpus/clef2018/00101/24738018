The protective effects of Shen-Fu injection on experimental acute pancreatitis in a rat model. In the present study, we investigated the protective effects of Shen-Fu injection (SFI) on a caerulein-induced rat pancreatitis (AP) model.SFI was given to rats in the SFI treated group through intraperitoneal injection. Blood and pancreas samples were collected for serological and histopathological studies.Our results showed that AP caused significant decrease in tissue glutathione (GSH) and serum IL-4 and IL-10, while pancreatic malondialdehyde (MDA) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) were increased. Furthermore, TNF-α, IL-1β, amylase, and lipase levels were also significantly increased. On the other hand, SFI treatment reserved all these biochemical indices as well as histopathologic alterations that were induced by caerulein.Our findings suggest that the SFI protects against caerulein-induced AP in rats via modulation of cytokines, oxidative stress, and Nuclear Factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activity.
