Effect of secretin on pancreatic juice proteins in caerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in the rat. Nine hours after the start of treatment with caerulein in rats, an increase in the weight of the pancreas and an increase in serum amylase levels were observed. Likewise, a significant increase in endogenous secretin occurred in rats with acute pancreatitis. A dramatic reduction in the secretion of total protein and amylase was also observed. A partial recovery of this latter effect was achieved after an infusion of high doses of secretin. Under our experimental conditions, the volume of secretion did not vary in caerulein-treated rats wtih respect to controls, either in resting conditions or under secretin stimulation, which indicates that the ductular cells were not significantly affected. Isoelectrofocusing (IEF) and crossed-immunoelectrophoresis (CIE) studies revealed important alterations in the proteins of the pancreatic juice of rats with caerulein-induced acute pancreatitis. Trypsinogen appeared to be particularly affected, showing an increase in the T2 acidic form with an IEP of 4.4 and a decrease in the basic form T3 with an IEP of 8.0, which splits in other forms with a clear antigenic community. A hydrolase was also observed with an IEP of 6.2. In this sense, secretin administration may also be said to induce a significant improvement in established acute pancreatitis, since it tended to normalize the structure and proportion of the proteins secreted.
