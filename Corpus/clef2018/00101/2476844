Exocrine pancreatic function in patients with progressive systemic sclerosis. The exocrine pancreatic function was investigated in 16 patients with progressive systemic sclerosis by means of a meal test (Lundh test) and in 9 of the patients by the secretin-cholecystokinin test as well. Gastrointestinal involvement with progressive systemic sclerosis was evaluated by esophageal manometry and by routine roentgenographic series of the small bowel. Fecal fat excretion measurement, the D-xylose absorption test, and a small-intestinal biopsy procedure were carried out. Duodenal juice was cultured and bacterial counts were estimated. One-third of the patients had reduced exocrine pancreatic function, but only four patients had unequivocally a reduction that could be of clinical importance. The results obtained with the meal test were in accordance with the secretin-cholecystokinin test, indicating a preserved capacity for endogenous stimulation.
