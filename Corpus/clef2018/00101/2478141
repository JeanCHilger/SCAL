Preservation-induced pancreatitis in an isolated perfused pancreas model in the dog. In order to investigate pancreatitis caused by cold ischemic damage to pancreatic grafts, an isolated, normothermic, ex vivo perfusion model was employed. Canine pancreases were subjected to 24 and 48 h of cold ischemia and then reperfused. The results showed that cold ischemia results in pancreatitis as measured by weight gain (tissue edema) and elevated leakage of amylase into the perfusate. The addition of allopurinol to the perfusion system did not prevent the signs of pancreatitis. From the results it can be concluded that the isolated, perfused pancreas model in the dog is useful for studying preservation-induced pancreatitis. The absence of any effect of allopurinol treatment suggests that oxygen-free radicals mediated by the xanthine oxidase system is of minor importance for the pathogenesis of postischemic pancreatitis.
