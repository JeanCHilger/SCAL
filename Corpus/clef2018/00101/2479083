Self-administration of enzyme substitution in the treatment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. The effect of self-administration (ad lib) of pancreatic enzyme substitution (Pancrease) in comparison with the dosage recommended by the manufacturer on abdominal symptoms and nutritional variables was studied in 10 patients with chronic pancreatitis. Both dosages were started in randomized order and they were continued for 4 weeks. Before and after each period of administration the patients were studied physically and weighed, and laboratory tests were performed. In addition, the patients kept daily records of pain (score, 0-3), bowel movements, amount of medication needed for maximum relief of symptoms and other remarks, if any. During self-administration, the number of capsules taken increased (5 +/- 1.3 to 11.4 +/- 2.4 p less than 0.001), the frequency of bowel movements decreased (3.6 +/- 1.4 to 1.6 +/- 0.7
