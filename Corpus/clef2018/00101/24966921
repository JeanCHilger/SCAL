Diosmetin ameliorates the severity of cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in mice by inhibiting the activation of the nuclear factor-ÎºB. Diosmetin (3', 5, 7-trihydroxy-4'-methoxyflavone), the aglycone part of the flavonoid glycosides diosmin occurs naturally in citrus fruit, was considered to exhibit anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Our study aimed to investigate the effect of diosmetin in a murine model of cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis (AP). Experimental AP was induced in mice by seven intraperitoneal injection of cerulein (50 ug/kg) at hourly intervals. Diosmetin (100 mg/kg) or vehicle was pretreated 2 h before the first cerulein injection. After 6 h, 9 h, 12 h of the first cerulein injection, the severity of acute pancreatitis was evaluated biochemically and morphologically. Pretreatment with diosmetin significantly reduced serum levels of amylase and lipase the histological injury
