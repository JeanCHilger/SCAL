Pancreatitis in children. Although the incidence of acute pancreatitis among children is less than that in adults, the physical and psychosocial impact on children and their families can be overwhelming. Pancreatitis is manifested as pain accompanied by a host of other complex issues. These issues are manifested more markedly when the patient has additional concomitant diagnoses. Pain management, liver function tests, amylase and lipase levels, endocrine and exocrine functionality, and recognition of systemic inflammation are especially important. Management after discharge from the hospital is often an ongoing stress for these patients and families, and multiple admissions to the intensive care unit may be necessary for feeding and pain complications. Presented in the context of an actual clinical case at a 500-bed tertiary care pediatric hospital, this patient's scenario illustrates the importance of ensuring adequate nutrition, maintaining hydration, providing appropriate pain management, and preventing infection and thromboembolic events.
