Enteral nutrition within 72 h after onset of acute pancreatitis vs delayed initiation. To explore early (within 72 h) vs delayed enteral nutrition (EN) therapy for patients with acute pancreatitis (AP).A total of 93 patients were allocated to two groups: early enteral nutrition (EEN) group (started within 72 h after onset) and delayed enteral nutrition (DEN) group (started beyond 72 h but within 7 days after onset). Baseline parameters and scores were recorded on admission and on day 3 after the initiation of EN therapy, as were the clinical outcome variables.Hospital mortality, length of stay, number of patients requiring mechanical ventilation and incidence of pancreatic infection in the EEN group were significantly lower than those in the DEN group all six reported deaths were in the DEN group. In the DEN group, more patients suffered from sepsis, shock or acute kidney injury, and more patients required surgical intervention or continuous renal replacement therapy. On day 3 after EN therapy was initiated, the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II scores, sequential organ failure assessment scores, C-reactive protein levels and the incidence of bowel wall thickening were lower in the EEN group than in the DEN group. The time when EN therapy was initiated was a prognostic variable for pancreatic infection (odds ratio, 24.08Compared with the DEN therapy, EEN therapy can accelerate the recovery of disturbed homeostasis, reduce the incidence of pancreatic infection and improve the clinical outcomes of AP patients. For AP patients, EN therapy should be initiated within 72 h after onset.
