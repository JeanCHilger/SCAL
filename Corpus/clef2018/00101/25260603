Acute pancreatitis and pregnancy: Cases study and literature review. To describe issues associated with the diagnosis of acute pregnancy-associated pancreatitis.Retrospective study of cases presenting at our establishment from 2002 to 2012. These cases were defined on the basis of the association of abdominal pain, serum lipase levels three times normal values, or signs of pancreatitis on ultrasound scans carried out on women pregnant at the time of diagnosis. A retrospective analysis of the medical files of these patients was carried out, considering epidemiological and etiological criteria, the treatments administered and maternal/fetal fate.We identified 10 cases during the study period, corresponding to an incidence of 1/1942. In 70% of cases, the patient was in the last three months of pregnancy. The pain was atypical in 70% of cases and ultrasound revealed biliary lithiasis in 30% of cases. None of the women died. In terms of neonatal morbidity, there were five preterm births, including one of an infant that died at the age of seven days. We then carried out a literature review, from which we determined the most appropriate course of action in cases of acute pancreatitis during pregnancy.Pancreatitis should be considered in pregnant women with abdominal pains because this diagnosis is easy to confirm and maternal and fetal outcomes are essentially dependent on the early etiological management of this condition. Preterm birth is the predominant factor for neonatal morbidity.
