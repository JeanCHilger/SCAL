Direct spraying of shakuyakukanzoto onto the duodenal papilla: a novel method for preventing pancreatitis following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Topical epinephrine application to the duodenal papilla reduces spasm of the sphincter of Oddi and prevents acute pancreatitis following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Shakuyakukanzoto (TJ-68) has an inhibitory effect on muscle contraction. Therefore, TJ-68 potentially allows the relaxation of the sphincter of Oddi, which can aid in the prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis.Thirty-six patients planned for ERCP were divided into TJ-68 (n = 17) and control groups (n = 19). In the TJ-68 group, the TJ-68 solution was endoscopically sprayed directly onto the duodenal papilla of patients. To assess the effects of TJ-68, serum amylase levels were measured at 1 h and 1 day after ERCP and symptoms were evaluated.The serum amylase levels at 1 h after ERCP were 273.6 ± 212.0 IU/l in the TJ-68 group and 428.7 ± 281.6 IU/l in the control group, showing a statistically significant difference (p = 0.036). The serum amylase levels at 24 h after ERCP were 230.0 ± 182.7 IU/l in the TJ-68 group and 497.4 ± 514.0 IU/l in the control group (p = 0.011). Post-ERCP pancreatitis was observed in 0 and 4 patients (21.1%) in the TJ-68 and control groups, respectively, which was not statistically significant (p = 0.11).Direct TJ-68 solution application to the duodenal papilla significantly inhibited the elevation of serum amylase levels. However, the preventive effect regarding post-ERCP pancreatitis was not confirmed in this study.
