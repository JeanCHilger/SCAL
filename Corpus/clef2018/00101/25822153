Nafamostat mesilate for prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis: a meta-analysis of prospective, randomized, controlled trials. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of nafamostat on the prevention of post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis (PEP).Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science were searched until April 18, 2014.Seven randomized controlled trials and 2956 patients met the search criteria. When compared with nonnafamostat, the incidence of PEP was reduced to 53% in the patients who received nafamostat (risk ratio [RR], 0.47 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.34-0.63). Further analyses were conducted based on the different risk classifications (n = 641 in patients with high risks: RR, 0.54Pooled analyses from current randomized controlled trials support the effectiveness of nafamostat for prophylaxis of PEP.
