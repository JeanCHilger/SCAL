A Simple Technique for Closing Multiple Muscular and Apical Ventricular Septal Defects. Multiple ventricular septal defects (VSDs) are difficult to close. In this report, we describe a simple and safe technique of closing multiple muscular and apical VSDs.Between January 2010 and December 2013, 52 patients with a muscular VSD either in isolation or in association with other congenital heart disease underwent surgery using this technique in which a black silk thread was passed through the suspected VSD opening into the left ventricle and brought out through the mitral valve and the interatrial septum. Sutures were placed around the silk thread to close the VSD.Out of 52 patients, 34 were male age ranged from 45 days to 5.5 years. In addition to the large subaortic/lage muscular VSD, three additional VSDs were present in 34 patients, two additional VSDs were present in 13 patients, and five patients had "Swiss Cheese septum." The VSDs were mid-muscular in 35 patients and were apical in 17 patients. Eleven patients had associated complex lesions. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiograms did not reveal any significant residual shunt in any of these patients. There was no step-up on oximetry. There was one hospital death due to sepsis. Follow-up was available in 48 patientsThe biventricular approach through trans-right atrial, trans-interatrial septum using a thread through the hole method for closing multiple muscular VSD is effective with no persistent residual defects.
