Effect of hypoxaemia on enzymes supplying myocardial energy in children with congenital heart disease. The differences in energy metabolism of the myocardium in children with congenital cardiac malformations producing hypoxaemia (arterial oxygen saturation 77 +/- 2%) or normoxaemia (arterial oxygen saturation 94 +/- 2%) were analysed by measuring the activity of the representative energy-supplying enzymes. Right atrial and ventricular tissue samples were obtained during surgical interventions. We demonstrated that myocardial metabolism was significantly influenced by hypoxaemia: the aerobic capacity of the energetic metabolism was reduced both in the atriums and ventricles. Atrial myocardium was more affected: in addition to citrate synthase, the activity of enzymes connected with lactate uptake and carbohydrate catabolism was also significantly decreased. These results demonstrate that the human heart is able to adapt to hypoxaemia by changing its energetic metabolism.
