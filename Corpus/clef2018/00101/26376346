Effects of Tempol on Experimental Acute Necrotizing Pancreatitis Model in Rats. We aimed to investigate the effects of Tempol on local organ damage in an experimental acute pancreatitis model.This experimental study was conducted on 40 male Wistar- albino rats. The animals were randomly allocated into four groups: (i) Sham-operated group, laparotomies and cannulations of the pancreatic duct without acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP) (n=10) (ii) Sham + Tempol group, identical to group 1 except for intravenous tempol treatment for 4Â hours (n = 10)Serum amylase levels, pancreatic tissue malondialdehyde and myeloperoxidase levels, wet/dry weight ratio, pancreatic edema, acinar necrosis, fat necrosis and hemorrhage, inflammation and perivascular infiltration were significantly lower in the ANP + Tempol group compared with the ANP group.Tempol infusion reduced local organ damage due to acute necrotizing pancreatitis in this experimental study. These findings demonstrate that tempol has protective effects on local organ damage due to acute necrotizing pancreatitis in rats.
