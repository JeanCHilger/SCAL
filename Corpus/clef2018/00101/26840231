Clinical features of acute obstructive suppurative pancreatic ductitis: A retrospective review of 20 cases. The clinical features of acute obstructive suppurative pancreatic ductitis (AOSPD) have not been elucidated. We aimed to clarify the clinical features of AOSPD.We retrospectively reviewed the clinical features of 20 patients with AOSPD at two tertiary referral centers between 1993 and 2012. We compared 17 AOSPD patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP) and 42 patients with acute-on-CP in terms of clinical characteristics, presentation, and laboratory and imaging findings.The etiology of AOSPD involved CP in 17 (85%) patients, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in 2 (10%), and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm in 1 (5%). Endoscopic pancreatic drainage was effective in 19 (95%) patients. Body temperature was significantly higher in AOSPD with CP than acute-on-CP patients (median: 38.2 vs 36.9 °C P < 0.001). Serum amylase levels at onset were significantly lower (median: 133 vs 364.5 U/LThe major etiology of AOSPD involved CP, and endoscopic pancreatic drainage was effective. The clinical features differ between AOSPD with CP and acute-on-CP.
