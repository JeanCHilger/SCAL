Methylene blue attenuates mitochondrial dysfunction of rat kidney during experimental acute pancreatitis. The disturbance of mitochondrial functions has been considered as one of the mechanisms of pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis (AP) followed by kidney failure. This study was aimed to investigate the effects of methylene blue (MB) on pancreas and kidney mitochondrial respiratory functions during experimental acute pancreatitis in rats.AP was induced by administrating sodium taurocholate into the pancreatic duct of male Wistar rats. The rats were divided into three groups: the MB group, MB (5 mg/kg) was injected intravenously 10 min prior to AP induction the AP group, saline solution was injected intravenously 10 min prior to AP inductionIntravenous injection of MB did not prevent AP-induced inhibition of pancreatic mitochondrial respiration however, MB significantly improved kidney mitochondrial respiratory functions with complex I-dependent substrates glutamate and malate. The activity of complex I of mitochondria isolated from AP-damaged kidney was increased after pretreatment with MB. However, MB did not affect AP-inhibited kidney mitochondrial respiration with succinate. MB had no protective effects on amylase activity or on urea content in serum in AP.The disturbances of kidney mitochondrial energy metabolism in experimental model of severe AP can be ameliorated by MB administration.
