Routine Measurement of Serum Amylase in Acute Abdomen. Acute abdominal pain is a common condition presenting to both the emergency department (ED) and surgical admission unit. Increase in serum amylase levels are found in much gastrointestinal pathology. Serum amylase level is consistently high in acute pancreatitis though high values are not pathognomonic of pancreatitis .The aim of this study to assess the level of serum amylase in various diseases presenting with acute abdominal pain and to evaluate the role of routine measurement of serum amylase in the screening of patient with acute abdominal pain for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis in a prospective series.A prospective observational study was performed from 15th May 2014 - 15th Nov 2014 (6 months) at Department of Surgery of Kathmandu medical College Teaching Hospital Kathmandu. All consecutive patients presented at emergency department and required admissions in surgical ward were included. A multivariate analysis was performed to assess the level of serum amylase in various diseases presenting with acute abdominal pain including acute pancreatitis.Overall, 318 patients were included during a period of 6 months among them 48 patients were excluded. 34 cases (12.6 %) were diagnosed of acute pancreatitis. three cases (1.1%) of non pancreatic pathology with raised serum amylase level (> 1000 U\L).Routine assessment of serum amylase is helpful in excluding differential diagnosis of patient presenting with acute abdomen and this study identified serum amylase as a good screening tool if done in cases with clinical suspicion.
