Pediatric Resident Attitudes and Knowledge of Critical Congenital Heart Disease Screening. This study aimed to understand the knowledge, attitudes and confidence level related to critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) screening among pediatric residents. Pediatric residents were assessed via an anonymous survey related to CCHD guidelines and procedures as set out by the New York State Department of Health. The survey was emailed to pediatric residents at a large academic institution. A teaching intervention was performed after the initial survey, which was followed by an identical after-intervention survey. Forty-two residents responded to the pre-intervention survey (n = 42), and forty post-intervention (n = 40). The mean composite knowledge score was 76 % pre-intervention and 92 % post-intervention, p < .001. Pre-intervention only 12 % of the respondents could answer all the questions correctly which increased to 60 % post-intervention. Confidence among residents regarding guidelines increased from 38 to 95 % post-intervention, p < .001. There was a positive correlation between the residents who felt confident of the guidelines and who answered correctly, r = .514, p < .001, n = 82. There was no significant difference between knowledge, attitudes or confidence level scores by year of training or the gender of the residents. Our study demonstrated a significant gap of knowledge among residents related to CCHD screening mandated by New York State health law. There was also a corresponding lack of confidence demonstrated by the residents in the guidelines. These data suggest that residents would benefit from further education on the proper implementation of a CCHD screening program. Further multicenter studies are warranted to assess similar gaps in other residency training programs in New York and wherever these screenings guidelines have been adopted.
