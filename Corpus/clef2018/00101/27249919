APPLICATION OF PRESEPSIN IN DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF PURULENT-SEPTIC COMPLICATIONS OF ACUTE NECROTIC PANCREATITIS. In 70 patients, suffering an acute necrotic pancreatitis (ANP), and 10 practically healthy persons a content of presepsin in a blood plasm, using immunochemiluminescent method and conducted bacteriological investigations, were analyzed. The infection occurrence is accompanied by plausible upgrading of a presepsin level in a blood plasm, depending on activity and severity of a septic process: in local infection--up to (677 ± 30) pg/ml, sepsis--up to (988 ± 47) pg/ml, severe sepsis--up to 2668 pg/ml in an ANP without infection it have constituted (332 ± 38) pg/mI at average, in practically healthy persons--(184 ± 16) pg/mI. A presepsin level correlates with a state severity in accordance to APACHE I scale, what permits to estimate the patients state severity objectively, to prognosticate a favorable and unfavorable consequences of treatment, rapidly changing, depending on efficacy of treatment.
