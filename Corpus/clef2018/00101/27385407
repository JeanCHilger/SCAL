Effects of Balloon Pulmonary Valvuloplasty as Preoperative Palliation for Tetralogy of Fallot. We investigated the effect of balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty (BPV) as a palliative procedure for patients with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF).This was a retrospective single-center study conducted between 2008 and 2014. We classified patients into three groups according to palliation: treatment with BPV (group I), with a Blalock-Taussig shunt (group II), and with infundibulectomy (group III). The growth of the pulmonary valve (PV) annulus and need for transannular patching (TAP) during total correction were compared between groups.Forty-eight patients were enrolled: 31, 10, and 7 in groups I, II, and III, respectively. The mean ages at palliation were 26.3 ± 23.6, 21.5 ± 16.4, and 15.2 ± 4.2 days in groups I, II, and III, respectively (P = .867). The success rate of BPV was 90.3%. The initial PV z-score before palliation did not differ between groups I, II, and III (-3.14 ± 1.44, -3.84 ± 1.47, and -3.71 ± 1.68 P = .494)BPV was an effective and safe palliation that increased pulmonary blood flow and promoted growth of the PV annulus in selected symptomatic newborns with TOF.
