Effect of ulinastatin on serum inflammatory factors in Asian patients with acute pancreatitis before and after treatment: a meta-analysis . We applied a meta-analysis to explore the effect of ulinastatin (UTI) on the serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in Asian patients with acute pancreatitis (AP).Various databases were searched based on stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria to extract relevant cohort studies. Comprehensive Meta-analysis 2.0 (Biostat Inc., Englewood, NJ, USA) was applied for statistical analyses.A total of 113 relevant studies (67 in Chinese, 46 in English) were initially retrieved. Finally, 11 eligible studies were enrolled in our meta-analysis with 399 pancreatitis patients. Meta-analysis results showed that after being treated with UTI, the serum levels of CRP, IL-6, and TNF-α were evidently decreased (CRP: SMD = -2.697, 95% CI = -4.399 ~ -0.994, p = 0.002 IL-6: SMD = -5.268, 95% CI = -9.850 ~ -0.687, p = 0.024UTI can effectively reduce the serum levels of CRP, IL-6, and TNF-α in Asian patients with AP, suggesting that UTI has anti-inflammatory effect on Asian patients with AP. .
