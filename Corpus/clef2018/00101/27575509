Incidence of congenital heart disease in newborns after pulse oximetry screening introduction. Congenital heart defects are the most common congenital malformations in the newborn with an estimated incidence ranging between 6-9 ‰. In Tunisia, this incidence reaches 1.9 ‰. This can be explained by misdiagnosed cases. In fact, the diagnosis is based mainly on clinical examination which allows making the diagnosis only in 50 in 75 % of the cases. Several studies showed the interest of pulse oximetry oximeter in the screening of cyanogenic and duct dependent congenital heart diseases. The Objective of our work is to determine the incidence of congenital heart diseases screened by physical examination coupled with the measure of transcutaneous saturation Methods:  forward-looking and descriptive Study, concerning all the births of the central maternity of Sousse, during a period of 12 months. We have measured transcutaneous saturation of all the newborn children in association to routine physical, examination. This study aimed to screen congenital heart disease and then calculate their incidence.during the period of the study 10447 newborn children had been born in the central maternity of Sousse. Among whom, 26 had a congenital heart defect. The incidence of the neonatal cardiac malformations in our current study was found in 2.77 ‰ of alive births. It was about 1.1 ‰ of newborns in a similar study practised in 2009 (Chi2=76.2 et p<10-4). The heart disorder was diagnosed following the grip taking of the only percutaneous saturation in 5 newborn children and following the clinical examination in 21.the measure of the transcutaneous saturation in the first day of life is a little expensive and specific method for the early screening of the duct dependent cardiac malformations.
