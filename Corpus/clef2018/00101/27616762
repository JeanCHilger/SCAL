Icodextrin-induced acute pancreatitis in a peritoneal dialysis patient: a case report and literature review . The 7.5% icodextrin solution is widely used for long-dwell in peritoneal dialysis (PD) regimens as an alternative osmotic agent to glucose. It has been defined as a biocompatible agent because of its iso-osmolarity and is generally safe and well tolerated. Icodextrin and its hydrolyzed metabolites are found in systemic circulation. In serum, icodextrin interferes with amylase determination causing a significantly decreased plasma amylase level making it unreliable for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. Lipase measurement provides an alternative and accurate method for diagnosing acute pancreatitis (AP) in patients using icodextrin. Icodextrin-induced acute pancreatitis is not well described. The literature appears limited to two case reports. We describe a case of a man with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on PD who developed acute pancreatitis following icodextrin use. We also provide a novel possible mechanism for understanding how icodextrin causes AP. .
