Elucidating the role of oxidative stress in the therapeutic effect of rutin on experimental acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis (AP) may be severe and cause hospitalization or death, and the available treatment is insufficient to control pancreatic inflammation and pain. Rutin is a natural flavonoid with the potential to treat AP via anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive, and antioxidant activities.This study investigated the beneficial effects of rutin on experimental AP induced by l-arginine administration in mice.The l-arginine-induced AP model was used in Swiss mice (n = 6-8). Mice submitted to AP induction were treated with rutin (37.5, 75, or 150 mg kgMice submitted to l-arginine injections developed abdominal hyperalgesia and increased serum amylase, lipase, C-reactive protein and IL-6 concentrations and increased pancreatic myeloperoxidase activity, edema index, MDA, and 3-nitrotyrosine contents. A marked decrease in catalase activity was observed in the pancreas without alterations of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity compared with the control group. Rutin treatment significantly impaired all the parameters that were altered by AP induction, but increased catalase and SOD activities in the pancreas compared with the vehicle-treated group.Rutin treatment exerted a protective effect on l-arginine-induced AP by mechanisms involving the reduction of oxidative stress, which suggests that this flavonoid has a potential for future approaches designed for the management of AP.
