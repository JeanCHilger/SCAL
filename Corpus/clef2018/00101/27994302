Modern Strategy for Identification of Congenital Heart Defects in the Neonatal Period. Congenital heart defects are the most common congenital anomalies and occur with an incidence from 0.8 to 1% per 1000 live births. In recent years, the pulse oximetry has become a strong candidate for detecting cyanogen congenital heart defects and in combination with routine clinical exam can improve diagnostic of congenital heart diseases.To apply the modern algorithm for early detection of congenital heart defects in order to improve the diagnosis in the neonatal period.This was a prospective study that included children born in Bihac Cantonal Hospital during 2012. The diagnostic algorithm included a clinical examination of the newborn, measuring of transcutaneous oxygen saturation with the pulse oximeter between 24 and 48 hours of life, and, in some cases, additional tests (cardiac ultrasound).A total of 1,865 children were examined. The application of diagnostic protocol identified the existence of congenital heart defects in 29 children. In re-evaluating the auscultator and ultrasound findings, we identified congenital heart defects in 19 children.The application of the modern algorithm for early detection of congenital heart diseases in the neonatal period can significantly improve the making of diagnosis of these anomalies. The concept is simple, inexpensive and applicable in most maternity wards.
