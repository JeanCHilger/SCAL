Safety and efficacy of chloral hydrate for conscious sedation of infants in the pediatric cardiovascular intensive care unit. This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of chloral hydrate administration for the conscious sedation of infants in the pediatric cardiovascular intensive care unit (PCICU).We conducted a retrospective review of the charts of 165 infants with congenital heart disease who received chloral hydrate in our PCICU between January 2014 and December 2014. Chloral hydrate was administered orally or rectally to infants using doses of 50 mg/kg. We collected and analyzed relevant clinical parameters.The overall length of time to achieve sedation was ranged from 5 to 35 min (10.8 ± 6.2 min) the overall mean duration of sedation was ranged from 15 to 60 min (33.5 ± 11.3 min)
