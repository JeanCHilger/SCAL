Pathogenesis of non-traumatic fat embolism. Like the liposomes of certain intravenous fat emulsions associated with embolic effects in acutely ill patients, chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) show calcium-dependent agglutination by C-reactive protein (CRP). It is suggested that non-traumatic fat embolism may be caused by agglutination of chylomicrons and VLDL by high levels of plasma CRP. This mechanism may also cause acute pancreatitis in patients with types I, IV, and V hyperlipidaemia, and avascular necrosis of bone in patients with corticosteroid-induced hyperlipidaemia.
