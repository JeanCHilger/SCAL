Varicella pancreatitis complicated by pancreatic pseudocyst and duodenal obstruction. Several viral infections, including mumps, coxsackie B, and infectious mononucleosis, have been associated with acute pancreatitis however, varicella infection has not previously been associated with this complication. A 29-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with severe abdominal pain and hyperamylasemia several days following the onset of a characteristic varicella skin rash. His son had been diagnosed with varicella one week earlier. The hospital course was complicated by the development of pseudocysts in the head and tail of the pancreas which caused partial obstruction of the common bile duct and duodenum. The pancreatitis, pseudocysts, and duodenal obstruction resolved with conservative medical management. This is the first report of acute pancreatitis associated with varicella infection.
