Age-related alterations in immunoreactive pancreatic lipase and cationic trypsinogen in young children with cystic fibrosis. Serum immunoreactive pancreatic lipase and cationic trypsinogen are elevated in young infants with cystic fibrosis (CF) and may be useful neonatal screening tests for CF. We compared lipase measured by a recently developed ELISA immunoassay with trypsinogen measured by radioimmunoassay in 70 children (ages 0.1 to 9.9 years) with CF who had various degrees of pancreatic dysfunction and in 79 similarly aged children without CF (controls). In the control children, lipase activity increased with advancing age, whereas trypsinogen showed no age-related trend. Lipase and trypsinogen were significantly elevated in the infants with CF who were younger than 1 year, irrespective of pancreatic function (trypsinogen, P less than 0.001 lipase, P less than 0.05). Sensitivities in detecting CF were 76% and 90% for lipase and trypsinogen, respectively. After the first year of life, lipase and trypsinogen values declined toward normal, the rate of decline of lipase being greater than that of trypsinogen
