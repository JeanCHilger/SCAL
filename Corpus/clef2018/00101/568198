Prostaglandin E1 therapy in infants with cyanotic congenital heart malformations: hemodynamic and angiographic findings (author's transl). During emergency cardiac catheterization, the mechanism of action of prostaglandin E1 (PG-E1) was studied in 7 newborn infants with cyanotic congenital heart malformations and decreased pulmonary blood flow. The main effects upon hemodynamics were an increase of pulmonary blood flow and a decrease of systemic blood flow. At the same time systemic blood pressure decreased slightly and a rise in systemic vascular resistance was calculated. An aortogram before and 15--20 minutes after the infusion of Pg-E1 was started, demonstrated a marked increase of the pulmonary blood flow and a dilation of the ductus arteriosus. Together with these hemodynamic effects the arterial and central venous oxygen saturation rose. In one infant with severe Tetralogy of Fallot, the ductus had already closed and could not be reopened by PgE1. In this infant PG-E1-Infusion had no effect upon arterial oxygen saturation. From these observations it can be concluded that dilation of the ductus is responsible for the rise in arterial oxygen saturation. 3the different indications for therapy with PG-E1 in the neonate are discussed.
