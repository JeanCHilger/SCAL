Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: a pathology review. A retrospective analysis of 12 patients with the diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura was undertaken with a review of pathological material. The gingival biopsy was found to be a poor method of diagnosing thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Pathological review also verified chronicity of disease. The pancreas was found to be the most severely involved organ, although serum amylase values did not always reflect pancreatic disease.
