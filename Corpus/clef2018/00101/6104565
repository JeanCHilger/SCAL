Somatostatin in the treatment of acute experimental pancreatitis (author's transl). An acute pancreatitis was induced in 20 GÃ¶ttinger mini pigs by implantation of a T-tube and application of contrast medium. This process was demonstrated by laboratory and microscopic findings. Continuous infusion (n=11) of 2500 mcg somatostatin (GHIF) over 10 h showed a significant reduction of amylase and blood glucose level corresponding to the microscopic findings. The group of animals treated with somatostatin (GHIF) showed a ratio of 1:5 between necrotic and unaffected parenchymal tissues. By contrast, the histologic findings of the untreated group showed a ratio of 1:1. The investigations of blood glucose, gastrin and glucagon levels showed a rebound effect after ending the treatment with somatostatin.
