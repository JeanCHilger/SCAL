Neurologic disorders and cerebral lesion in children with TGA (transposition of the great arteries) (author's transl). 118 consecutive patients with TGA were examined for neurologic disorders (ND) and cerebral lesions (CL) between 1967--1979 of whom 43 are alive. 66 had simple TGA, 52 had VSD, PS and/or coarctation as additional lesion.--43 were corrected surgically of whom 32 are alive.--Neurologic examination was performed in all, EEG, CT, arteriography, scintigraphy and autopsy when necessary or possible. Patholog. findings (CL, ND) were detected in 66 47 had definite ND or CL, while 19 showed gross motor development delay. 52 of 118 children with TGA were without neurolog. or cerebral pathology. --Several factors were investigated for their etiologic influence: 1. Additional cardiac lesions played no significant role. 2. The lower O2 saturation in the ascending aorta of the fetal circulation in TGA may be of importance. 3. Red blood count, hemoglobin, hematocrit were higher in the group with ND or CL. 4. Early appearance of cerebral lesion should suggest earlier corrective surgery.
