The effect of intraductal duct occlusion with a fast hardening amino acid solution in acute animal experimental pancreatitis. The effect of the occlusion of the pancreatic duct system by Ethibloc was studied in cases of acute pancreatitis in animal experiments. Application of 4,5 ml Ethibloc leads to high significant reduction of amylase increase. The favourable effect is markedly reduced after application of 9 ml Ethibloc. A partial excretory function could be demonstrated also after disintegration of Ethibloc. Histological follow-up shows a progredient fibrotic atrophy of pancreas parenchyma.
