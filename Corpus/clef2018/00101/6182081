Influence of gastrointestinal hormones on the course of acute experimental pancreatitis. The influence of exogenous administration and endogenous release of certain g.i. hormones on the course of acute experimental pancreatitis was studied. Administration of 2 g of a pellet diet every eight hours decreased survival, as did repeated s.c. administration of the cholecystokinin-analogue caerulein. Also oral administration of a trypsin inhibitor--releasing intestinal factors or hormones stimulating pancreatic enzyme synthesis and secretion--decreased survival. On the other hand repeated s.c. administration of secretin or an anticholinergic drug (Pro-Banthine), or oral administration of 0.1 N HCl every eight hours did not influence survival. At blind macroscopic evaluation, caerulein was found to cause signs of more severe disease. All pancreatic rats had increased S-amylase levels, but there was no difference between any of the groups. In peritoneal fluid, however, caerulein caused an increase in the amylase activity. The results suggest that elevated S-levels of g.i. hormones, which primarily stimulate pancreatic enzyme synthesis and secretion, are harmful in acute experimental pancreatitis.
