Acute alcohol intoxication: significance of the amylase level. To evaluate the effects of acute alcohol intoxication on serum amylase and isoamylase levels, 58 clinically intoxicated patients with blood alcohol levels greater than 100 mg/dL were studied. Comparisons were made to normal control and a sober chronic alcoholic group. Admitting serum isoamylase levels were determined by cellulose acetate membrane electrophoresis and serum amylase levels measured by the Amylochrome technique. The average blood alcohol level in the intoxicated group was 301 +/- 99 mg/dL. Thirty of the 58 patients had hyperamylasemia (greater than 207 IU). Twenty-five of these 30 patients had hyperamylasemia from nonpancreatic sources (increased salivary isoamylase). Two of the 30 patients had pancreatic hyperamylasemia and three patients had elevated levels of both isoamylases. Neither of the patients with pancreatic hyperamylasemia had clinical evidence of acute pancreatitis. Although nine of the 58 patients had abdominal pain and clinical symptoms suggestive of acute pancreatitis, none of these patients had elevated pancreatic isoamylase. The finding of hyperamylasemia in acutely intoxicated patients is common. This is most frequently due to a rise in the salivary (nonpancreatic) isoamylase. The reliability of the total serum amylase as an indication of pancreatic disease in the intoxicated patient is questioned.
