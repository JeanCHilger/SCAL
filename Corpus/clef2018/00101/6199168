Early detection of biliary pancreatitis. Biochemical tests (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, gammaglutamyltranspeptidase, bilirubin, and serum amylase) were performed upon admission in 84 patients with suspected (36) or proven (48) acute pancreatitis at the time of the first episode of acute abdominal pain suspected clinically as acute pancreatitis. These parameters all increased significantly more in patients with gallstone pancreatitis. Among them, the SGPT was the most discriminant test between biliary and nonbiliary pancreatitis. The positive predictive value of SGPT was 92%, when the cutoff point was chosen at twice the upper limit of normal. In patients with increased SGPT, a SGOT-SGPT ratio less than 1 is the rule (88%) for those with gallstone pancreatitis. This enzymatic determination allowed us to select more accurately the patients suitable for morphological procedures to confirm the biliary origin of the pancreatitis.
