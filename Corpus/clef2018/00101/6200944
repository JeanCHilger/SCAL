Release of ribonuclease from anoxic pancreas. Poly-[C]-specific ribonuclease (RNase) is released in large amounts from rat pancreas incubated at 37 degrees C in isotonic saline solution. Pancreatic cell disruption by homogenization releases only 10% of that RNase. The remainder, perhaps membrane-bound, is freed only after further membrane deterioration during anoxic incubation. Other tissues (small intestine, stomach, colon, liver, spleen, kidney, muscle, and skin) do not appear to contain much of this RNase or to release it during anoxic incubation. Relatively little amylase is released from the pancreas under the conditions that release RNase. The findings provide a rational basis for monitoring serum RNase levels in patients with acute pancreatitis for early detection and treatment of pancreatic necrosis in man.
