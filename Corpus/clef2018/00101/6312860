Acute pancreatitis (a Coxsackie B2?) and associated anomalies. Authors report one case of acute pancreatitis in an obese twelve-year-old girl. The clinical picture appeared, without antecedent causes, as acute abdomen which required operation. Reduced echodensity of the pancreas was not found. The patient improved and recovered completely, her course being uneventful two years later. Scoliosis due to hemivertebra, and renal hypoplasia were present. No pancreatic malformation according to hypothesis of commun pathogenic mechanism was identified. Antibody titer to coxsackie B2 suggesting etiologic role was obtained. Amylase creatinine clearance ratio was calculated and suitability of establishing diagnostic values for pediatric ages is emphasized.
