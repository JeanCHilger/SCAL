Polyarthritis and bone lesions complicating traumatic pancreatitis in two children. The association of bone lesions, polyarthritis and cutaneous nodules with pancreatic disease is being recognized and reported more frequently. In adults all forms of pancreatitis and carcinoma of the pancreas have been involved, but in the few children described these complications have been associated with acute traumatic pancreatitis. This paper describes two cases of acute traumatic pancreatitis in which polyarthritis and limb pains were noted after 2 to 3 weeks. In one child osteolytic lesions and periostitis were seen on roentgenograms 7 weeks after the onset of pancreatitis. In the other child minor roentgenographic changes were not seen until 5 months after the onset however, bone scans showed clear-cut abnormalities after 1 month. Almost complete resolution could be expected within a year. Serum lipase and amylase concentrations remained elevated during the acute illness. Disseminated fat necrosis is apparently related to the excess amounts of circulating lipase.
