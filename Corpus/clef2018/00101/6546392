C reactive protein: an aid to assessment and monitoring of acute pancreatitis. An evaluation of C reactive protein as an indicator of the progress of acute pancreatitis has been made, and the data have been compared with the information given by the white cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and temperature and by two antiproteases--alpha 1 protease inhibitor and alpha 1 antichymotrypsin. The main value of C reactive protein is to provide a guide to the severity of the inflammation and to increase clinicians' awareness of the patient's enhanced risk of developing pancreatic collections when the C reactive protein concentration remains high (greater than 100 mg/l) at the end of the first week of the illness. In this respect C reactive protein concentrations are superior to white cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and temperature and the concentrations of antiproteases.
