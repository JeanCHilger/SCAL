Transcutaneous oxygen tension in sick infants. The clinical usefulness of the transcutaneous O2 electrode was investigated in 30 sick infants 159 simultaneous measurements of arterial PO2 and transcutaneous PO2 were made. During the comparisons, arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and thoracic impedance were continuously recorded, and skin axillary and environmental temperatures and hematocrit were noted. Despite a wide range of arterial blood pressure and hematocrits, arterial PO2 and transcutaneous PO2 were similar (slope, 0.963), except for 2 groups of sick infants. Some infants with severe, persistent pulmonary hypertension who were receiving an intravascular infusion of tolazoline and infants with mean arterial blood pressures more than 2.5 SD less than the predicted average had values for transcutaneous PO2 that were lower than PO2. The surface O2 electrode is safe and relatively easy to use and provides data that can help in the management of most sick infants.
