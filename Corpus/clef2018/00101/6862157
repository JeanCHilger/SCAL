Effect of bombesin on serum immunoreactive trypsin in healthy subjects and in patients with chronic pancreatitis. We studied the effect of bombesin (9 ng/kg X min for 30 min by intravenous infusion) on serum immunoreactive trypsin in healthy subjects and in chronic pancreatitis patients. Bombesin administration caused a marked and significant increase of serum immunoreactive trypsin concentration in healthy subjects. The increase occurred in the first 15 min after the beginning of bombesin infusion and persisted for the duration of the study (2 h). In patients with chronic pancreatitis, the increase was much less pronounced. In these patients, the integrated immunoreactive trypsin response to bombesin was significantly correlated with bicarbonate, lipase, and chymotrypsin outputs into the duodenum. The response of serum immunoreactive trypsin to bombesin stimulation seems to vary according to the degree of pancreatic exocrine dysfunction and to reflect the functional capacity of acinar cell mass.
