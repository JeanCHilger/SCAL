Surgical results and factors affecting operative mortality in total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage. Factors affecting the surgical results of total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage were evaluated in 17 patients in an attempt to establish an appropriate plan of management. The mortality rate correlated with age, size of interatrial communication, arterial oxygen saturation and left heart volume but not with pulmonary to systemic systolic pressure ratio, vascular resistance ratio and right ventricular volume. In cases where the symptoms appeared early in life, left heart volume was small and clinical features were severe. Four children with a left ventricular end-diastolic volume of less than 65% of normal died of low cardiac output syndrome. In those with an unusually small left heart, enlargement of the left atrium and/or delayed ligation of the anomalous vertical vein were considered more favorable. Left atrial and ventricular volumes were restored to normal after the surgery.
