Appraisal of the Mustard procedure for the physiological correction of "simple" transposition of the great arteries. Eighty consecutive cases, 1970-1980. Eighty successive patients underwent the Mustard operation for "simple" transposition of the great arteries (TGA) between January, 1970, and January, 1980. Ages ranged from 42 days to 12.4 years (mean 14.7 months). Balloon atrial septostomy (BAS) with balloon volumes of more than 2.5 ml produced significant increases of arterial oxygen saturation, although the initial benefit of BAS was greater than that found at follow-up catheterization. In these patients the left ventricular (LV) pressure tended to decrease during the first months of life, but this drop was less marked at the end of the first year. Deep hypothermia and cardiocirculatory arrest were employed in all cases. Several modifications were adapted to the original surgical technique in order to reduce last sequelae. There were two early and three late deaths. At follow-up (mean 4.5 years) 74% of patients were symptom free. Sinoatrial and atrioventricular (AV) conduction disturbances were present in five and six patients, respectively. Caval or pulmonary venous obstruction occurred in 13 patients, seven of whom required reoperation. Isolated tricuspid valve incompetence was present in one patient only, but in four it was associated with other defects. Primary right ventricular (RV) failure occurred in one patient. These findings, in relation to mortality, complications, and the excellent clinical results in the majority of survivors, compare favorably with results published for patients with "simple" TGA who have been subjected to other types of physiological or anatomic correction. At the present time, there seems to be no good reason to alter our surgical policy in this group of patients.
