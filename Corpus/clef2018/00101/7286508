Echocardiography for the evaluation of tricuspid atresia. II. Analysis of the left ventricular function (author's transl). Twenty-five patients with tricuspid atresia, ranging in age between 2 months and 23 years, previously morphologically studied, were assessed by M-mode echocardiography with regard to left ventricular function. Fifteen of them underwent palliative cardiac surgery (systemic-pulmonary anastomosis). Thirty normal subjects, same age and sex, were selected as controls. Patients with tricuspid atresia had a significant increase of left ventricular dimensions and mass and significant decrease of shortening fraction and ejection fraction. The left ventricular pre-ejection/ejection ratio (LPEP/LVET) was significantly higher in patients with tricuspid atresia compared to normals. In patients without surgical shunt there was no significant correlation between Qp/Qs determined by oximetry and the end-diastolic dimension and left ventricular function parameters. In patients with surgical shunt a significant correlation was found between ejection fraction, shortening fraction, systolic time intervals and Qp/Qs. Qp/Qs significantly correlated with end-diastolic dimension. Shortening fraction and ejection fraction were higher in patients with satisfactory systemic saturation, while left ventricular mass was increased in patients with longstanding surgical shunt. These data suggest that patients with tricuspid atresia, with or without surgical shunt, may present with a decreased left ventricular function, early detectable by echocardiography.
