Energy metabolism in mouse pancreas in response to different dosages of a CCK analogue. Stimulation of the exocrine pancreas with cholecystokinin analogues leads to a variety of intraacinar processes, many coupled to energy consumption. It was hypothesized that extensive ATP depletion could play a role in the pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis, especially in the hyperstimulation (cerulein) model. Mice received seven intraperitoneal injections of cerulein at hourly intervals, at doses ranging from physiological (0.1 micrograms/kg) to pharmacological (50 micrograms/kg). A single dose of cerulein induced a 28-33% decrease in ATP, whereas a complete course of injections led to a nadir as low as 45% of the control value. The overall pattern of ATP tissue content during the observed time course was surprisingly similar in all four groups and statistically not different at any time point. Until 12 h, ATP levels in all groups remained below the control value. In contrast, serum amylase and light microscopy reflected a degree of pancreatitis in a close dose-response pattern to the administered cerulein dose. These findings suggest that ATP depletion--although probably facilitating acinar damage--does not seem to play a causal or primary role in the pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis.
