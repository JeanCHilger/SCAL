Effect of chronic administration of hydrocortisone on the induction and evolution of acute pancreatitis induced by cerulein. The effects of chronic administration of hydrocortisone (10 mg/kg/day) on the development and evolution of acute pancreatitis induced by supramaximal stimulation with cerulein were examined in the rat. In these circumstances the potentially therapeutic effect of L-364,718, a CCK-receptor antagonist, was assayed. Administration of hydrocortisone over 7 days did not increase the severity of edematous acute pancreatitis induced by cerulein, since the reduction in pancreatic secretion, the hyperamylasemia and the increase in the levels of hematocrit and fluid in the pancreatic tissue were similar in rats with acute pancreatitis treated and untreated with hydrocortisone previously. When hydrocortisone was administered chronically, before administration of supramaximal doses of cerulein, a spontaneous regression of acute pancreatitis occurred. However, when hydrocortisone administration was continued after inducing pancreatitis, pancreatic recovery was prevented, observing a significantly depressed acinar secretion and elevated values of hematocrit and tissue fluid (edema). L-364,718 administration proved to be detrimental in the evolution of edematous acute pancreatitis when the rats had been treated chronically with hydrocortisone because the blockade exerted on secretion prevented the draining of enzymes stored in excess by hydrocortisone administration.
