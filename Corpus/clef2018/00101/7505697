The importance of the plasma proteins of the blood in maintaining the relative constancy of its hydrolytic properties. Effects of hypervolemia, dehydration, activation and inhibition of urine-formation, i. v. administration of amylase and pepsinogen, experimental acute pancreatitis upon amylolytic activity of blood plasma, contents of pepsinogen in it, amylase and pepsinogen within the blood plasma protein factions, and excretion of enzymes with the urine, were studied in dogs. The data obtained suggest an important role of interconnection between amylase and pepsinogen with the plasma proteins in their renal and extrarenal excretion from the organism and in maintenance of a relative constancy of the contents and activity of enzymes in the blood. The affinity of the plasma proteins to their stains can indirectly characterise the transport capacity of the proteins in respect to amylase and pepsinogen.
