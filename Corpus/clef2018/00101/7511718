Beneficial effects of taurolidine in experimental pancreatitis. Taurolidine has potent antiendotoxin and antimicrobial effects in vitro. This study assessed the effect of taurolidine in a well-described model of acute pancreatitis. Ninety-five male Wistar rats (250 g) were studied. Pancreatitis was induced by intraductal injection of 50 microliters of a 4% sodium taurocholate solution at a pressure of 25 cm water. Animals were randomly allocated to 1 of 10 groups: 4 groups were used to characterize the model and there were 6 treatment groups. Taurolidine (100 mg/kg) or saline was administered intravenously at Time 1, 4 hr, or 4 and 24 hr following induction of pancreatitis. Serum amylase, endotoxin levels, and blood cultures were assessed at 4 and 24 hr. Survival was documented at 1 week. Serum amylase levels were elevated in animals in whom acute pancreatitis was induced however, there was no difference in serum amylase between animals treated with taurolidine and those treated with saline. Positive blood cultures were more numerous in saline-treated groups. Treatment with taurolidine was associated with significantly (P < 0.01) lower endotoxin levels (14 +/- 8 pg/ml) compared with saline-treated animals (350 +/- 87 pg/ml). Taurolidine administration significantly improved survival compared with controls, when given at 4, 24, and 4/24 hr postinduction of pancreatitis (P < 0.05). Taurolidine was beneficial in this model of acute pancreatitis.
