Phaeochromocytoma presenting as acute hyperamylasaemia and multiple organ failure. Phaeochromocytoma may present in many different ways. We report an unusual presentation of phaeochromocytoma in a man with hyperamylasaemia and multiple organ failure thought to be due to acute relapsing pancreatitis. Abdominal ultrasound and computerised tomography (CT) examinations revealed a mass at the tail of the pancreas. Fine needle biopsy of the mass precipitated headache, intense vasoconstriction and labile blood pressure. He proceeded to laparotomy, at which an 8 x 9 cm mass was found to be replacing the left adrenal gland. Histological examination revealed a phaeochromocytoma. This case illustrates that hyperamylasaemia and multiple organ failure may be unusual presentations of phaeochromocytoma and may be unusual presentations of phaeochromocytoma and phaeochromocytoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a peripancreatic mass found by ultrasound or CT.
