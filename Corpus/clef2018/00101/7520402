Platelet-activating factor involvement in the aggravation of acute pancreatitis in rabbits. Platelet activating factor (PAF) was administered to anesthetized rabbits with cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis to investigate the role of PAF in the development of acute pancreatitis. In acute edematous pancreatitis, induced with cerulein 20 micrograms/kg/h i.v. for 5 h, blood flow in the gastroduodenal and superior mesenteric arteries (GDAF and SMAF) had decreased significantly by 30 min and the serum amylase and lipase levels were significantly increased in the early phase. In the cerulein+PAF group, in which PAF was injected 100 ng/kg/min i.v. for 20 min simultaneously with cerulein, GDAF and SMAF declined significantly to 52 +/- 4 and 47 +/- 3% (p < 0.05), serum amylase and lipase levels rose significantly to 1,110 +/- 150 and 1,370 +/- 190% (p < 0.01) at 300 min, much higher than in the cerulein group. Furthermore, scattered hemorrhages and more marked inflammatory cell infiltration were observed histologically. These findings suggest that PAF has an additive role in the aggravation of acute pancreatitis.
