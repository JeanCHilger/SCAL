Microsurgical evaluation of experimental pancreatitis after allopurinol: a secretory serological and morphological study. The purpose of the present work was to evaluate the efficacy of allopurinol in rat cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis, by studying amylase and lipase concentrations in bile-pancreatic juice and serum, blood leukocytes, and pancreatic histology. Supramaximal doses of cerulein, injected intraperitoneally twice with a 1-h interval (50 micrograms/kg), caused a reduction in juice amylase and lipase, high levels of the two enzymes in serum, leukocytosis, and severe histological damage to the pancreas, including the presence of diffuse cellular necrosis. These responses were not substantially altered by cotreatment with allopurinol (40 mg/kg i.p. twice with a 1-h interval) or by posttreatment with allopurinol (60 mg/kg i.p. 3 h after cerulein). In contrast, pretreatment with allopurinol (40 mg/kg allopurinol, 1 h, 20 mg/kg allopurinol + 50 micrograms/kg cerulein, 30 min, 40 mg/kg allopurinol, 30 min, 50 micrograms/kg cerulein) had a clear protective effect on pancreatic morphology and function, as shown by higher juice amylase and lipase values, lower serum amylase and lipase concentrations, and an almost normal histological picture of the pancreas. We concluded that allopurinol is effective in preventing the acute pancreatitis caused by administration of supramaximal doses of cerulein, by blocking the free radical generation in pancreatic tissue.
