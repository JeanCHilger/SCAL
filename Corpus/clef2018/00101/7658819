Early antibiotic treatment in acute necrotising pancreatitis. Despite improvements in surgical treatment and intensive care, mortality from severe acute pancreatitis remains high. We have carried out a randomised study of 60 consecutive patients with alcohol-induced necrotising pancreatitis to find out whether early antibiotic treatment can improve outcome. 30 patients were assigned cefuroxime (4.5 g/day intravenously) from admission. In the second group, no antibiotic treatment was given until clinical or microbiologically verified infection or after a secondary rise in C-reactive protein. The inclusion criteria were C-reactive protein concentration above 120 mg/L within 48 h of admission and low enhancement (< 30 Hounsfield units) on contrast-enhanced computed tomography. There were more infectious complications in the non-antibiotic than in the antibiotic group (mean per patient 1.8 vs 1.0, p = 0.01). The most common cause of sepsis was Staphylococcus epidermidis positive cultures were obtained from pancreatic necrosis or the central venous line in 14 of 18 patients with suspected but blood-culture-negative sepsis. Mortality was higher in the non-antibiotic group (seven vs one in the antibiotic group
