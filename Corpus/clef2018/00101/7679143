Pancreatitis and anomalous union of the pancreaticobiliary ductal system in childhood. From January 1978 to December 1989, 48 patients were diagnosed as having anomalous union of the pancreaticobiliary ductal system (AUPBD) at the Second Department of Surgery, Kanazawa University Hospital and its affiliated hospitals. Among these 48 patients, 13 (28.1%) were children under 13 years of age. Four of these patients had acute pancreatitis. The clinical, radiological, and surgical features of these patients are presented. The chief presenting complaint was epigastric pain in all cases three patients had recurrent episodes of epigastric pain and had been diagnosed as having autotoxicosis. AUPBD was clearly demonstrated in all patients, three by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and one by operative cholangiography. At operation, macroscopic evidence of pancreatitis was recognized in all cases. In one case, roentogenolucent pancreaticolithiases were seen on ERCP. We consider AUPBD as an important cause of pancreatitis in children and advocate ERCP in children who are suspected having biliary tract or pancreatic disease. The diagnosis of AUPBD should be considered when children with abdominal pain and elevated serum or urinary amylase levels are evaluated.
