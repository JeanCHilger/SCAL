Acute hemolysis with subsequent life-threatening pancreatitis in hemodialysis. A complication which is not preventable with current dialysis equipment. A retrospective study was undertaken of 14 patients (eleven men, three women mean age 52 [33-68] years in whom haemolysis had occurred during chronic haemodialysis (n = 12) or haemofiltration (n = 2). The haemolysis was of mechanical cause in eight patients, by an osmotic mechanism in one, and of unknown cause in five. Cardinal symptoms were nausea in 14 patients, abdominal pain in nine, vomiting in eight and raised blood pressure in ten. The plasma was discoloured in all patients and there was also an increase in free haemoglobin (110-2400 mg/dl) and (or) lactate dehydrogenase (311-7403 U/l). In all of eleven patients in whom it was measured the activity of serum amylase and (or) lipase was more than doubled (to 73-2400 U/l and 473-16,740 U/l, respectively). All patients were treated symptomatically, three had a blood exchange, two others plasma separation. Eight patients recovered within a few days, but necrotizing pancreatitis developed in six, three of whom died while two had permanent sequelae. This series shows that dialysis-induced acute haemolysis can cause life-threatening pancreatitis. Narrowings within the extracorporeal circuit, not always recognized in current dialysis equipment, are the most frequent cause of the mechanical haemolysis.
