Anti-ulcer agent, cetraxate hydrochloride (Neuer), prevents subcellular redistribution of lysosomal enzyme in caerulein-induced pancreatitis in the rat. The protective effect of an anti-ulcer agent, cetraxate hydrochloride [4-(2-carboxyethyl)phenyltrans-4-amino- methylcyclohexanecarboxylate hydrochloride], on the exocrine pancreas in caerulein-induced pancreatitis of rats was investigated. Hyperamylasaemia, pancreatic oedema and activation of trypsinogen in the pancreatic tissue, as well as subcellular redistribution of the lysosomal enzyme, cathepsin B, from the lysosomal fraction to the zymogen fraction, were prevented by infusion of 20 mg/kg.h cetraxate for 2 h before caerulein infusion and throughout the 3.5 h of caerulein infusion (5 micrograms/kg.h). The results indicate that cetraxate plays its protective roles against pancreatitis by inhibiting the redistribution of lysosomal enzyme and by activation of trypsinogen such activities may be clinically useful in preventing pancreatic injuries, particularly in patients with chronic pancreatitis.
