Pathophysiology of the pancreatic defect in Johanson-Blizzard syndrome: a disorder of acinar development. We compared pancreatic acinar and ductal secretion in two patients with Johanson-Blizzard syndrome, age-matched control subjects, and patients with other primary pancreatic diseases. Patients with Johanson-Blizzard syndrome had preservation of ductular output of fluid and electrolytes, as in patients with Shwachman syndrome but differing from those with cystic fibrosis, who have a primary ductular defect. They also had decreased acinar secretion of trypsin, colipase and total lipase, and low serum immunoreactive trypsinogen levels, consistent with a primary acinar cell defect.
