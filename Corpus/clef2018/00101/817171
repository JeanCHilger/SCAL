Clinical Significance of Different Tests for the Diagnosis of Chronic Diseases of the Pancreas. Enzymatic, functional and morphological test are used for the diagnosis of pancreatic diseases. The enzymatic tests-amylase is the enzyme activity most frequently investigated-are best suited to the diagnosis of acute diseases. In chronic inflammations of the pancreas the serum enzymes do not usually increase because of the destruction of the parenchyma. The provocation test with pancreozymin secretin is especially indicated in chronic diseases of the pancreas. Digestion and absorption are only disturbed in the late stages of the disease. It is important to investigate them to determine the necessary susbtitution therapy. No method should be used alone, only series of tests give satisfactory results.
