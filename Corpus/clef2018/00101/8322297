Normal hemoglobin levels in children with cyanotic heart disease. Is it iron deficiency anemia?. Decreased arterial oxygen saturation in cyanotic congenital heart disease causes a compensatory rise in haemoglobin and haematocrit levels. There is an inverse correlation between arterial oxygen saturation and haemoglobin/haematocrit. This holds true as long as the erythropoiesis is not restricted by other factors. The haematological values and arterial oxygen saturations of three children with cyanotic congenital heart disease are presented. They illustrate how iron deficiency causes discrepant values for arterial oxygen saturation and haemoglobin/haematocrit and that "normal" haemoglobin/haematocrit levels in such children may constitute anaemia. Measurements of MCV, MCH and serum ferritin reveal the existence of iron deficiency anaemia. Low grade iron medication is recommended for children with cyanotic congenital heart disease.
