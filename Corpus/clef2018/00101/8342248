Long common channel syndrome as etiology of choledochal cysts and pancreatitis--two instructive cases. The aetiology of choledochal cysts is controversial. The authors report two cases of Type I C and Type IV B choledochal cysts both showing axial dilatation of the common bile duct and common hepatic ducts, single fusiform (Type IC) and multiple cysts of extrahepatic ducts only (Type IVB). Both had anomalous junction of the pancreaticobiliary ductal system as delineated on ERCP leading to the formation of a long common channel. Both these female patients presented in the third decade of life with 7-8 years history of repeated episodes of right upper abdominal and epigastric pain suggestive of pancreatitis. Similar pain was precipitated in both patients following ERCP with raised serum amylase. Hepatico-enterostomy gave lasting relief in both these patients.
