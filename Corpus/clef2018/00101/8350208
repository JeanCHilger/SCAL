The diagnostic and therapeutic role of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in children. We performed 121 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographies (ERCPs) in 92 patients (60 girls and 32 boys), aged 4 months to 19 years, as part of diagnostic evaluation for suspected pancreatic or biliary tract disease or as therapeutic intervention. ERCP was successful in 116 attempts. The most common indications were recurrent pancreatitis (35 children), nonresolving acute pancreatitis (20), unexplained elevated amylase or lipase (19), postcholecystectomy syndrome (14), and elevated biliary tract enzymes (12). One hundred and one ERCPs were performed for more than one indication. The most common findings included chronic pancreatitis (26 cases), pancreas divisum (14), dilated pancreatic duct (10), gallstones or sludge (8), and abnormal common bile duct (8). Complications were uncommon and usually minor. ERCP is a safe and helpful procedure in the evaluation of suspected pancreatic and biliary tract disease in children and frequently allows for nonoperative treatment of these disorders.
