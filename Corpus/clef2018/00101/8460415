Protective effects of therapy with a protease and xanthine oxidase inhibitor in short form pancreatic biliary obstruction and ischemia in rats. The current study was done to evaluate the effects of short term (60 minutes) pancreatic biliary duct obstruction (PBDO) with intraductal hypertension (IDH) stimulated by secretin (0.2 clinical unit per kilogram per hour) and caerulein (0.2 microgram per kilogram per hour) plus 30 minutes of temporary pancreatic ischemia (ISCH) produced by ligation of celiac and superior mesenteric artery on the exocrine pancreas and protective effects of a new potent protease inhibitor, ONO3307 in combination with xanthine oxidase inhibitor, allopurinol, in this multifactor related model of acute pancreatitis in rats. Twelve hours after PBDO with IDH plus ISCH, we observed hyperamylasemia (23 +/- 3 units per milliliter) (p < 0.01) moderate pancreatic histologic changes
