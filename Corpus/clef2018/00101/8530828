Plasma amino acid consumption and pancreatic secretion during and after cerulein-induced pancreatitis in rats. The decrease in pancreatic exocrine secretion during the course of acute pancreatitis is a well-documented process. However, the mechanisms underlying this reduced pancreatic function are not fully understood. To analyze pancreatic protein synthesis and secretion during and after cerulein-induced pancreatitis, we performed the plasma amino acid consumption test on conscious rats. After stimulation with 1 microgram cerulein/kg/h sc for 1 h, the control group with intact pancreas exhibited a decrease in plasma amino acid by about 15%, and this decrease could be abolished by the administration of the specific CCK-receptor antagonist, loxiglumide. Protein and amylase secretion were augmented by cerulein to about 400% of control values. Upon supramaximal stimulation of the pancreas with cerulein (20 micrograms/kg/h sc for 5 h), we observed a profound decrease of pancreatic secretion, which was accompanied by a more prolonged and more pronounced decrease of plasma amino acids (25%). Two hours after cessation of the supramaximal stimulation of pancreatic secretion (to induce pancreatitis), the administration of 1 microgram/kg/h of cerulein for 1 h resulted in a further decrease of amino plasma acid level, whereas no stimulation of exocrine pancreatic secretion was observed. Eighteen hours later, repeated administration of 1 microgram/kg/h of cerulein was still able to induce amino acid decrease by 20%, but again, no stimulation of exocrine pancreatic secretion was detectable. We conclude that, in the time course of acute cerulein-induced hyperstimulation, there might be an imbalance between synthesis of pancreatic enzymes (reflected by amino acid consumption) and the release of exocrine pancreatic secretion into the duodenum, which may be explained by leakage of proteolytic enzymes from damaged acinar cells into the extracellular space of the pancreas.
