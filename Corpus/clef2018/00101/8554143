Bile-pancreatic juice replacement not cholinergic- and cholecystokinin-receptor blockade reverses acinar cell hyperstimulation after bile-pancreatic duct ligation. Acinar cell inhibitors (eg, atropine) fail to ameliorate clinical and experimental acute pancreatitis. We hypothesized that amelioration of pancreatic acinar cell hyperstimulation after bile and pancreatic duct ligation is better with gut replacement of bile and pancreatic juice than with cholinergic- and cholecystokinin (CCK)-receptor blockade.Using acinar cell amylase activity as an index of hyperstimulation, we studied 63 rats in two sets of experiments. Bile-pancreatic juice exclusion from gut--without (set one) and with (set two) bile and pancreatic duct obstruction--was treated with atropine and CCK-receptor antagonist L-364,718, or with enteral replacement of bile-pancreatic juice.In the set one experiment, acinar cell hyperstimulation after bile-pancreatic juice exclusion was reversed by combined L-364,718 and atropine pretreatment. In set two, acinar cell hyperstimulation after bile and pancreatic duct ligation was reversed by enteral bile and pancreatic juice replacement, but not by combined L-364,718 and atropine pretreatment.According to this experimental corollary of early gallstone impaction, prevention of acinar cell hyperstimulation after duct occlusion should be aimed at the source of the response to bile-pancreatic juice exclusion, namely, the gut, rather than at the target of the response, the pancreatic acinar cell.
