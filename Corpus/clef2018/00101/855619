Postpancreatitic pseudocysts. The retroperitoneal situation of the pancreas makes it relatively innaccessibile in the anatomic sense and provides difficulty in assessing the presence and extent of pathologic processes on a clinical base. Pseudocysts and extravasation of amylase into various retroperitoneal spaces have been described as complication of acute pancreatitis. The author emphasise the utility of the laboratory investigations and the importance of the various radiological procedures in every stage of evolution of the above disease. Lastly, attention is drawn to the diagnostic aid which is obtainable from complementary investigations and appropriate techniques.
