Improvement of perioperative hemodynamics and gas exchange by inhalation of nitric oxide in children with congenital cardiopulmonary defects. In critically ill infants and children before or after surgery for congenital cardiopulmonary disease it was evaluated whether continuous NO inhalation can reduce pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and improve arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2).All patients (n = 24 age 1 day-6.5 years) were intubated and artificially ventilated. They had either secondary pulmonary hypertension (n = 16), acute respiratory distress syndrome (n = 3), or reduced SaO2 (n = 5) due to pulmonary hypoperfusion. NO was introduced into the afferent limb of the ventilator circuit close to the endotracheal tube, while continuously measuring the inspired NO and O2 concentrations. The initially applied concentration of NO was 20 +/- 2.0 ppm.The hemodynamic condition and/or oxygen saturation was significantly improved by NO in 23 patients (95%). Mean PAP declined significantly from 45 +/- 7 to 28 +/- 3.7 mm Hg, while mean systemic arterial pressure remained constant (56 +/- 2.1 vs. 58 +/- 2.5 mm Hg). This was related to a selective reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance by 48 +/- 8.5%. SaO2 increased significantly (p < 0.05) from 83 +/- 2.5% to 93 +/- 1.5% due to a decreased intrapulmonary right-to-left shunt. NO therapy was applied with a median of 6 days (range 1.5-36 days). During NO inhalation methemoglobin concentration was significantly increased (0.77 +/- 0.05% vs. 1.46 +/- 0.15%), but neither was oxygen transport capacity affected, nor was any evidence for accumulation observed. Using a model ventilatory circuit, a nitric dioxide (NO2) formation of 1.14 +/- 0.11% of the applied NO concentration was measured, i.e. approximately 0.5 ppm NO2 at 40 ppm NO. This amount of NO2 in the inspired gas is well below toxicologically relevant concentrations.Low-dose NO inhalation selectively reduces PAP and improves SaO2 in children with congenital cardiopulmonary disease during perioperative intensive care. It is expected that the overall hemodynamic improvement is related to a reduced afterload of the subpulmonary ventricle without changes in coronary perfusion pressure, as is often observed with other vasodilators applied intravenously. We recommend an upper dose limit of 40 ppm NO for continuous NO inhalation to avoid possible toxicologically relevant NO2 concentrations.
