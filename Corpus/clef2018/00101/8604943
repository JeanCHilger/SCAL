Routine primary repair of tetralogy of Fallot in neonates and infants less than three months of age. Although primary repair of tetralogy of Fallot is increasingly undertaken in infancy, complete repair is generally performed in only selected symptomatic neonates.From July 1992 through March 1995, 30 consecutive neonates and young infants with tetralogy of Fallot underwent routine primary repair. Group I (n = 10) consisted of patients with tetralogy of Fallot and pulmonary atresia (n = 5) or severe pulmonary stenosis (n = 5) who were duct dependent and were repaired in the neonatal period. Group II (n = 11) consisted of patients who were asymptomatic with arterial oxygen saturation between 75% and 90% (adequate pulmonary blood flow). Group III (n = 9) consisted of patients with "pink" tetralogy of Fallot (arterial oxygen saturation > 90%). Patients in groups II and III were electively scheduled for repair at about 2 months of age.The postrepair peak systolic right ventricular-to-peak systolic left ventricular pressure ratio did not correlate (p = 0.96) with the branch pulmonary artery size. One patient died 2 months after operation, despite good hemodynamics, of uncontrollable diffuse subcutaneous edema due to familial distichiasis lymphedema syndrome. There were no late deaths. At a median follow-up of 19 months, 1 patient underwent balloon dilation of branch pulmonary arteries. Follow-up echocardiography revealed a 30 to 60 mm Hg right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery gradient in 3 patients.Excellent early and midterm results can be accomplished with routine primary repair of tetralogy of Fallot in early infancy regardless of age, symptomatic status, coronary anatomy, and the size of branch pulmonary arteries as long as they arborize normally.
