The effect of thoracic duct drainage in acute pancreatitis in the animal experiment. In animal experiments the effect of lymph drainage from the thoracic duct on acute pancreatitis was studied. Experimental animals were dogs. Drainage was performed by inserting a catheter into the thoracic duct. Compared with control animals without drainage, values of amylase and lipase in blood, urine, and peritoneal exudate were lowered, the enzyme activity in lymph was elevated. The dogs with drainage survived for a longer time, the macroscopic and microscopic changes of the pancreas were less expressed.
