Attenuation of endotoxin-induced multiple organ dysfunction by 1-amino-2-hydroxy-guanidine, a potent inhibitor of inducible nitric oxide synthase. 1. We have investigated the effects of (i) several guanidines on the activity of the inducible isoform of nitric oxide (NO) synthase (iNOS) in murine cultured macrophages and rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (RASM) and (ii) 1-amino-2-hydroxy-guanidine, the most potent inhibitor of iNOS activity discovered, on haemodynamics, multiple organ (liver, renal, and pancreas) dysfunction and iNOS activity in rats with endotoxic shock. 2. The synthesized guanidine analogues caused concentration-dependent inhibitions of the increase in nitrite formation caused by lipopolysaccaride (LPS, 1 microgram ml-1) in J774.2 macrophages and RASM cells with the following rank order of potency: 1-amino-2-hydroxy-guanidine > 1-amino-2-methyl-guanidine > 1-amino-1-methyl-guanidine > 1-amino-1,2-dimethyl-guanidine. Interestingly, 1-amino-2-hydroxy-guanidine (IC50: J774.2, 68 microM
