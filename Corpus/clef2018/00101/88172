Use of prostaglandin E1 in infants with d-transposition of the great arteries and intact ventricular septum. Prostaglandin E1 was used to treat five infants with d-transposition of the great arteries and intact ventricular septum who had persistent severe hypoxemia after the creation of an interatrial communication. Three infants had a dramatic improvement in systemic arterial oxygen saturation associated with dilation of the ductus arteriosus in two of the three cases urgent surgery was avoided. Two infants had no clinical evidence of increased ductal shunting and no improvement in oxygen saturation. A trial of prostaglandin E1 is recommended for treatment of severe hypoxemia in infants with d-transposition of the great arteries with intact ventricular septum if the presence of a large atrial septal defect is established.
