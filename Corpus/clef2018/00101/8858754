Serum trypsinogen-2 in the prediction of outcome in acute necrotizing pancreatitis. The accuracy of serum trypsinogen-2 in predicting the severity of acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP) was prospectively evaluated in 52 consecutive patients.A new sensitive immunofluorometric assay was used for serum trypsinogen-2,Mean values during the first 24 h were 42.1 micrograms/l in control patients, 1435 micrograms/l in uncomplicated cases, and 4090 micrograms/l in complicated or fatal cases. There was a significant difference in serum trypsinogen-2 values between patients with uncomplicated and complicated disease (p = 0.002) already on admission. When a cutoff level of 1000 micrograms/l was used, patients with uncomplicated ANP were differentiated from patients with complicated ANP with a sensitivity of 91% and with a specificity of 71%.The immunofluorometric assay of serum trypsinogen-2 is a sensitive and specific method for prediction of the severity of the disease in necrotizing pancreatitis.
