Massive pleural effusion in pancreatitis: 2 case reports. We report 2 patients with left-sided pleural effusion occurring in the setting of acute pancreatitis. Both patients had a strong history of alcohol consumption. In each case the pleural fluid amylase was markedly elevated, higher than that in the serum. The effusions resolved with closed chest tube drainage and the pancreatitis subsided with conservative therapy. In patients presenting with significant pleural effusions and acute upper abdominal symptoms, a thoracentesis with determination of the amylase titre may provide a quick means of diagnosing acute pancreatitis.
