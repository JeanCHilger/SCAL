Hydatid acute pancreatitis: a rare complication of hydatid liver disease. Report of two cases. Acute pancreatitis (AP) is known to be a rare complication of hydatid disease. We present two cases of AP due to intrabiliary ruptured hydatid cysts of the liver. High serum and urine amylase levels and ultrasonographic findings, compatible with AP, were detected. On ultrasonography and computed tomography dilated bile ducts and cystic masses in the liver were seen. A communication between the bile ducts and a cyst in one case, and a total common bile duct obstruction with hydatid material in the other case, were seen on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatograms. The patients were treated surgically with mainly omentoplasty. Recovery was uneventful. A diagnosis of AP should be kept in mind in patients with hydatid liver disease presenting with upper abdominal pain.
