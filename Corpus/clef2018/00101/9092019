Acute pancreatitis in rheumatoid purpura. Apropos of 2 cases. Abdominal pain observed in Henoch-Sch√∂nlein purpura (HSP) is usually attributed to digestive tract involvement. Pancreatic involvement is a rare and benign complication. The authors report two cases of acute pancreatitis as a complication of HSP. Pancreatitis was confirmed in both cases by clinical presentation and increase of serum amylase levels. Abdominal echography has demonstrated ascites or alithiasic cholecystitis without pancreatic abnormality. The prognosis was favourable in each case. Pathophysiologic mechanism is presumably a vasculitis of the small vessels specially within the pancreas leading to inflammation. Abdominal pain can be explained by a digestive tract involvement but also by an acute pancreatitis. This later occurrence is not as exceptional as reported in the literature. Thus, serum amylase levels should be evaluated in patients with HSP who have intense epigastric or abdominal pain, in order to recognize a pancreatic involvement.
