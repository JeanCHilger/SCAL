Massive subcutaneous and intraosseous fat necrosis associated with pancreatitis. Natural evolution of the radiographic picture. A 44-year-old man developed high fever, polyarthralgias, erythematous tender nodules and plaques on feet, ankles, knees and dorsum of the hands, as well as swelling of ankles and several joints of hands and feet. Laboratory evaluation showed high serum pancreatic amylase and lipase. Histological study of a subcutaneous nodule demonstrated fat necrosis. X-ray examination revealed numerous lytic lesions involving cancellous and cortical bone in phalanges, metacarpals, radius, tibia, tarsus and metatarsals, with areas of widened bone. The patient never referred any abdominal symptom. He evolved favourably within the following months. A year later, resolution of most of the bone lesions was observed.
