Acute pancreatitis and AIDS. It's well known that patients was acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) can develop various kinds of hepatobiliopancreatic diseases, for causes related to AIDS and for causes not related to HIV infection. The authors describe a case to their attention due to a suspected acute pancreatitis. The patient presented with abdominal pain, increased serum alkaline phosphatase and amylase levels. Serological test and stool concentration didn't show any opportunistic infection (Cytomegalovirus, Cryptosporidium). Abdominal ultrasonography showed enlargement of the head of the pancreas, gallbladder with biliary sludge, and a little dilatation of the biliary tree. The patient didn't feel better despite the medical treatment, so considering the probability of the migration of calculus, the patient underwent cholecystectomy. After the operation the patient felt better quickly. This case confirms the presence in HIV patients of pancreatitis for causes unrelated to AIDS like cholelithiasis as we showed, alcoholism, hypercalcemia, and the importance of an opportune surgical treatment that was resolutive.
