Acute pancreatitis after long-term 5-aminosalicylic acid therapy. Acute pancreatitis is a known, although rare, complication of mesalamine treatment. This complication typically appears within the first days or weeks after initiation of therapy. We describe two cases of acute pancreatitis that occurred after long term mesalamine therapy for ulcerative colitis. A rechallenge, performed in both patients, confirmed the diagnosis of mesalamine-induced pancreatitis. These case reports provide evidence that 5-aminosalicylic acid may induce acute pancreatitis after long term treatment.
