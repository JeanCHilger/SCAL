Effect of non-pulsatile renal blood flow on plasma erythropoietin. Erythropoietin is a hormone responsible for regulation of red blood cell production. Circulating erythropoietin values are regulated by renal oxygen supply, which is determined by hemoglobin concentration, hemoglobin oxygen saturation, and renal blood flow. Previous animal and human studies regarding erythropoietin regulation have assumed pulsatile renal blood flow. During cardiopulmonary bypass, non-pulsatile renal perfusion has been shown to result in decreased glomerular filtration rate and decreased renal blood flow in comparison to pulsatile perfusion. Repair of congenital heart disease during cardiopulmonary bypass is an attractive circumstance in which to study the effect of non-pulsatile blood flow on erythropoietin production. The hypothesis in this study was that non-pulsatile perfusion would result in increased erythropoietin production because of decreased renal oxygen supply. Fourteen children with congenital heart disease and without preoperative renal insufficiency or anemia were enrolled in the study. All patients underwent cardiopulmonary bypass with non-pulsatile flow. In addition, 10 control patients without congenital heart disease were enrolled. Six cardiopulmonary bypass patients had 1.5- to 6-fold increases in plasma erythropoietin concentrations from baseline. These patients had longer cardiopulmonary bypass times, more commonly performed under low flow deep hypothermic conditions. The remaining 8 patients with congenital heart disease, and all control patients, did not develop increased postoperative erythropoietin concentrations. The conditions under which cardiopulmonary bypass are performed appear to influence postoperative circulating erythropoietin concentrations.
