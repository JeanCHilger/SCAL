Leukotriene generation and neutrophil infiltration after experimental acute pancreatitis. The role of 5-lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid in the inflammatory response associated with experimental acute pancreatitis has been evaluated. For this purpose, an experimental necrohemorrhagic pancreatitis was induced in rats by intraductal administration of 5% sodium taurocholate. Neutrophil infiltration was detected in pancreas at 1 and 3 h after the induction of pancreatitis. This was concomitant with increased levels of leukotriene B4 and peptide leukotrienes (C4, D4 and E4). In lung, similar increases in neutrophil infiltration were detected but only 3 h after acute pancreatitis induction, and no changes in leukotriene B4 nor peptide leukotrienes were apparent at this time. These results suggest that after induction of acute pancreatitis, 5-lipoxygenase metabolites could play a role in the inflammatory response in the pancreas, but they are not involved in the inflammatory response in lung.
