Clinical significance of pancreatic ascites. Recurrence of pancreatic ascites in a patient after two courses of peritoneal lavage suggested pancreatic ductal disruption as the etiolgy, and this was confirmed at operation. Peritoneal lavage in two other patients with pancreatic ascites without ductal disruption or cysts was associated with resolution ascites. The use of peritoneal lavage in patients with acute or chronic pancreatic ascites may guide the selection of those requiring early surgical treatment.
