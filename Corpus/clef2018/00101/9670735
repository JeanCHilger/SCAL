Effects of trental and thiotriazoline on neutrophil dehydrogenase activity in acute experimental pancreatitis. The lowering of activity of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (alpha GPDH), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH), the raising of activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was noted in neutrophil granulocytes in an acute experimental pancreatitis. The prophylaxis of SDH, alpha GPDH, G-6-PDH activity lowering and LDH activity raising was promoted by trental and thiotriazoline injection.
