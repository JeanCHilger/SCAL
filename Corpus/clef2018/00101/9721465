Etiology and pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis. The theory of pancreatic gland autodigestion by pancreatic enzymes assumed by Chiari 1886 as the crucial moment in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis (AP) remains accepted so far. The appearance of mutations of cationic trypsinogen gene on the 7th chromosome in several families with hereditary AP, supports the significance of trypsin in the initiation of AP. The generally recognized etiologic factors of AP include the biliary tract disease and alcohol. Opie in his "Common Channel theory" assumed that the impacted gallstone in the ampulla of Vater could cause a permanent obstruction and subsequently AP. Later clinical studies have confirmed that a short-term block of the common pancreatic duct caused by migrating gallstones is associated with onset of AP. Chronic consumption of alcohol evokes subclinical pancreatic disturbances already prior to the onset of AP. PAP (pancreatic associated protein) being the marker of pancreatic inflammation was significantly increased in chronic alcoholism without signs of AP. Many pathophysiological concepts and effective therapeutic procedures which were successful in the animal studies have not turned out to be appropriate in man. The destruction of both cellular structure and cellular connections is an early event in the development of experimental AP. There is much evidence that free oxygen radicals and the disturbances of microcirculation determine the severeness of AP. The roles of NO (nitric oxide) and kinins remain to be clarified cytokins a interleukin 2 (IL2) and interleukin 10 (IL10) had a protective effect in experimental AP. In humans the antagonist of PAF (platelet activating factor) had reduced the occurrence of organ failure. There is hope, that this knowledge, will lead to new therapeutic possibilities.
