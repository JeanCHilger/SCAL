Changes of inflammatory mediator in aucte necrotizing pancreatitis and effect of somatostatin analogne stilamin in rats. To investigate the changes of inflammatory mediator in ANP and to explore the effectiveness of stilamin treatment on ANP.SD rats were divided into experimental groups (ANP = 12, ANP + NS = 10, ANP + Stilamin = 12) and control group (NC = 10). Rat ANP models were made by retrograde injection of 3.5% sodium taurocholate 2.5 ml/kg into the pancreatic duct, and treated by intravenous injection of stilamin 84 micrograms.kg-1.d-1 or same amount of normal saline respectively. Serum IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-12, TNF-alpha, PLA2, amylase and endotoxin were examined. Finally, the morphology and pathology of the pancreas, liver, lung, heart and kidney, as well as the electronmicroscopical investigation of liver and lung cells were observed.The mean IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-12, TNF-alpha, in the ANP and ANP + NS group were higher than those in the ANP + stilamin group and Control group (P < 0.01). The endotoxin, amlyase, PLA2 level in the ANP + stilamin group was lower than those in the ANP and ANP + NS groups (P < 0.001). ANP significantly increased white blood cell chemotax and infiltration, as well as hemorrhagic focus in liver, kidney and lung, but the pathological examinations of the liver, pancreas, lung and kidney demonstrated much less destruction in the stilamin group.Inflammatory cytokins play an essential role to induce pathophysiological process of ANP, and its related MODS may be effectively prevented and treated by stilamin.
