L-asparaginase (Leunase) induced pancreatitis in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A major complication of L-asparaginase therapy in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is pancreatitis. Among the 915 cases of ALL seen over last 10 years, 19 (2%) developed pancreatitis. Median age was 5.5 years with a median duration of symptoms of 4 weeks. All cases had raised serum amylase and lipase. Pancreatitis was not related to the dose/duration of L-asparaginase therapy. Ultrasonography can be used as a corroborative investigation for diagnosis along with serum chemistries. Close clinical monitoring of children for early diagnosis of this complication is recommended.
