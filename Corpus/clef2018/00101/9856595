Disopyramide: a promising new approach to the medical treatment of the hypercyanotic spell complicating tetralogy of Fallot. Under continuous ECG and oxygen saturation (SpO2) monitoring, the following measurements were taken by Doppler echocardiography in 6 consecutive patients with tetralogy of Fallot (TF) before and after intravenous administration of disopyramide (2mg/kg): left ventricular shortening fraction (LVSF) peak velocities in the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT)
