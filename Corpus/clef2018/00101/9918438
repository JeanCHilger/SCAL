Blood concentrations of polymorphonuclear leucocyte elastase and interleukin-6 are indicators for the occurrence of multiple organ failures at the early stage of acute pancreatitis. We studied potential indicators of severe acute pancreatitis by measuring the blood concentrations of various cytokines, polymorphonuclear leucocyte elastase (PMN-E), acute phase reactants, pancreatic amylase (P-AMY), pancreatic elastase-1 (E-1) and white blood cell (WBC) counts in patients with acute pancreatitis. In addition, the presence of multiple organ damage was assessed. Subjects consisted of 22 patients with acute pancreatitis including severe (n = 11), moderate (n = 4) and mild (n = 7) cases. A significant positive correlation was observed between the number of organs damaged and the peak concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6, PMN-E, C-reactive protein (CRP) and pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (PSTI). Among these markers, blood concentrations of PMN-E and IL-6 rapidly increased and peaked at the early phase of acute pancreatitis whereas CRP and PSTI did not. The elevation of PMN-E and IL-6 was greater the more severe the symptoms. However, no significant correlation was observed between the number of organs damaged and the maximum serum concentrations of P-AMY and E-1, or the WBC count, which have been considered to be markers of pancreatitis. These results suggest that PMN-E and IL-6 concentrations are useful indicators of severity and prognosis and their determination facilitates the selection of appropriate treatment in the early stages of disease to prevent the aggressive progression of acute pancreatitis.
