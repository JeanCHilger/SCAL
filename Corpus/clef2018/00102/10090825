Involvement of peritoneal macrophage in the induction of cytotoxicity due to apoptosis in ascitic fluid associated with severe acute pancreatitis. The aim of this study was to assess the significance of peritoneal macrophage in inducing cytotoxicity in ascitic fluid associated with severe acute pancreatitis. The involvement of peritoneal macrophage was examined experimentally in rats by macrophage depletion with peritoneal lavage prior to the development of pancreatitis. More than 94% of the cellular components collected from peritoneal cavities by the lavage are macrophages. Although the ascitic fluid collected from the rats with necrotizing pancreatitis showed cytocidal effects via apoptosis on Madin-Darby canine kidney cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, cytotoxicity or apoptosis-inducing activity almost disappeared from the ascitic fluid by the preceding peritoneal lavage. The ascitic fluid did not show significant differences by the lavage in osmolarity and in concentrations of albumin, bilirubin, amylase, and lipase. Although a slight reduction of tumor necrosis factor-alpha was noted with the lavage, tumor necrosis factor-alpha failed to induce apoptotic cell death in the cells, and the neutralization by antibody ameliorated neither cell death nor apoptosis. We conclude that peritoneal macrophages secrete apoptosis-inducing factor(s) into pancreatitis-associated ascitic fluid, other than tumor necrosis factor-alpha.
