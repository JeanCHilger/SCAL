Prophylactic effect of somatostatin on post-ERCP pancreatitis: a randomized controlled trial. Somatostatin is a potent inhibitor of pancreatic secretion and has been studied for its prophylactic effect on post-ERCP pancreatitis. However, results of previous trials have been inconclusive.A prospective double-blind controlled study was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of somatostatin in preventing post-ERCP pancreatitis. Post-ERCP enzyme elevation, abdominal pain and pancreatitis were evaluated and compared between 109 patients randomized to receive somatostatin infusion and 111 patients randomized to receive normal saline infusion (placebo) both started 30 minutes before ERCP and continued for 12 hours.Post-ERCP elevation of serum amylase and lipase levels at 6 and 24 hours after ERCP was less frequent in the group given somatostatin but not statistically significant. There was a tendency toward lower mean serum amylase and lipase levels at 24 hours in patients given somatostatin, although the difference was not statistically significant either. Eight patients given somatostatin (7%) and 18 patients given placebo (16%) had significant abdominal pain after ERCP requiring analgesia (p = 0.04). The frequency of clinical pancreatitis was significantly lower in patients given somatostatin (3%) than in those given placebo (10%) (p = 0.03).Prophylactic treatment with somatostatin reduced the frequency of post-ERCP pancreatitis.
