The role of platelet activating factor in pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis in dogs. 17 Beagle's dogs were divided randomly into tree groups: pancreatitis group (PG, n = 6), pan+BN52021 group (BNG, n = 6), control group (CG, n = 5). The acute pancreatitic model of PG and BNG was established by injecting sodium taurocholate and trypsin into the main pancreatic duct. Animals of BNG were injected PAF receptor antagonist BN52021 (5 ml/kg) intravenously 5 minutes and 3 hours respectively after acute pancreatitis induction. Blood amylase activity was determined by Winslow's method. PAF in blood and pancreatic tissue was determined by the platelet accumulation method. Blood amylase activity of PG increased by 466.7 +/- 111.6 than the baseline at 8 hours and increased significantly than that of BNG and CG (P < 0.05). Blood PAF level of PG increased from 30 minutes to 11.81 +/- 0.78 ng/ml at 8 hours. BN52021 inhibited very significantly the increase of PAF level (P < 0.01). PAF level in pancreatic tissue of PG was significantly higher than that of BNG and CG (P < 0.01). PAF may play an important role in early acute pancreatitis.
