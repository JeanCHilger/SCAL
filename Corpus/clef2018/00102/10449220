Pancreatic pseudocysts in 4 dogs and 2 cats: ultrasonographic and clinicopathologic findings. Pancreatic pseudocysts were diagnosed in 4 dogs and 2 cats based on ultrasonographic and clinicopathologic findings. All 6 animals had a clinical diagnosis of pancreatitis. Five of 6 pseudocysts were in the left pancreatic limb, and in 1 cat the pseudocyst was in the pancreatic body region. Cyst size ranged from 2 x 2 cm to 7 x 6 cm. All pseudocysts had anechoic regions that were aspirated using ultrasound guidance for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. No morbidity was associated with the aspiration procedures. Cytologically the pseudocyst fluid was aseptic in all patients and had low numbers of inflammatory cells in 5 of 6 patients. All animals had high lipase activity in the pseudocyst fluid and in 2 dogs and 1 cat the lipase activity in the fluid was greater than in serum. Three of the 4 dogs were managed medically. In the 1 dog that had long-term follow-up ultrasound examination, the pseudocyst persisted for several days following aspiration and had disappeared 8 months after diagnosis. All 3 of these dogs were clinically normal 1.5-4 years after presentation. The 4th dog underwent surgical exploration and was euthanized shortly thereafter because of bronchopneumonia and chronic pancreatitis. The 2 cats died 10 days and 2 months, respectively, following initial diagnosis of the pseudocyst, but necropsies were not performed in either case. Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration of pancreatic pseudocysts and clinicopathologic evaluation of cystic fluid are useful for diagnosis of pancreatic pseudocysts.
