Endoluminal ultrasonography for pancreatic diseases. Endoluminal ultrasonography was performed on 146 patients with pancreatobiliary diseases by using high-frequency, thin ultrasonic probes, and the usefulness of the new technique in diagnosis of pancreatic diseases was reported. The ultrasound probe could be inserted into the main pancreatic duct in 43 of 46 patients (93.5%), and images of the lesions could be obtained in 42 patients (91.3%). Endoluminal ultrasonography revealed a hypoechoic mass with clear margins and central echogenicity in patients with pancreatic carcinoma. Endoluminal ultrasonography showed normal pancreatic parenchyma as a fine reticular pattern and did not reveal the tumors surrounding the stenosis in patients with focal pancreatitis. Endoluminal ultrasonography in patients with intraductal papillary adenocarcinoma of the pancreas revealed cystic lesions with mural nodules more than 4 mm, mucus echoes, and solid tumors with mixed echo patterns. There were no severe complications, and acute pancreatitis occurred in none of 46 patients, but high-level serum amylase after examination occurred in 5 patients (10.9%). Endoluminal ultrasonography is useful for differential diagnosis in patients with small pancreatic tumors or cystic lesions, especially intraductal papillary tumors of the pancreas. Endoluminal ultrasonography is recommended as a precise examination for the diagnosis of cystic lesions of the pancreas or stenosis of the main pancreatic duct after ERCP and EUS.
