Acute pancreatitis in children caused by gallstones. A 10 year-old girl presented with acute abdominal pain. Serum-amylase was 3959 U/l. Ultrasonography showed dilatation of both the common bile duct and the pancreatic duct and a high density area near the ampulla. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) verified a stone near the ampulla, which was removed after sphincterotomy. The girl recovered fully.
