Protein C activation during the initial phase of experimental acute pancreatitis in the rabbit. Disturbances of coagulation and fibrinolysis are well-known systemic effects of acute necrotising pancreatitis (ANP). The purpose of this experimental study was to evaluate the initial events in the haemostatic activation during ANP in an animal model with relevance to the human situation.ANP was introduced in 7 rabbits by infusion of chenodeoxycholic acid in the pancreatic duct. Seven rabbits served as sham-operated controls. Serial measurements of coagulation variables (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, FVII activity, fibrinogen, tissue factor activity), anticoagulant proteins (protein C, antithrombin) and fibrinolytic factors (tissue plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1) were performed for 5 h.ANP was confirmed by elevated serum amylase, development of ascites, and histological changes of the pancreas. A moderate activation of the coagulation system was found in both study groups. A significant decrease in protein C concentration from 1 h after the induction of ANP was found, whereas the response of antithrombin and the inhibition of the fibrinolytic system were similar in the 2 study groups. Microthrombosis of the lungs or kidneys was found in 2 rabbits with ANP.An immediate activation of protein C is a specific characteristic of the haemostatic activation in ANP in rabbits. This activation has not been described previously and the possible therapeutic implications ought to be studied.
