Do plasma and urine trypsinogen activation peptides (TAP) really increase in trypsin-taurocholate-induced pancreatitis? Plasma and urine levels of trypsinogen activation peptides (TAP) reflect the severity of acute pancreatitis in experimental and clinical acute pancreatitis. In trypsin-taurocholate-induced pancreatitis in rats, the extrinsic bovine trypsin used for the induction of pancreatitis might influence on the TAP levels after induction of pancreatitis. The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether infused trypsin itself affects TAP levels in trypsin-taurocholate-induced pancreatitis. Rats were divided into three groups. In the pancreatitis group, acute pancreatitis was induced by a retrograde infusion of bovine trypsin and sodium taurocholate into the pancreatic duct. In the duct infusion group and peritoneal injection group, a mixture of bovine trypsin and trypsin inhibitor, ONO-3403, was infused into the pancreatic duct or the peritoneal cavity. Plasma and urine TAP concentration significantly increased in trypsin-taurocholate-induced pancreatitis but not in the duct infusion and peritoneal injection groups for 6 hours after the infusion of trypsin. Serum rat immunoreactive trypsin (IRT) and amylase significantly increased in the pancreatitis and duct infusion groups but not in the peritoneal injection group. Serum levels of bovine IRT in the pancreatitis group was significantly lower than those in duct infusion and peritoneal injection groups. In conclusion, an intraductal infusion of bovine trypsin itself into pancreatic duct does not influence the levels of plasma and urine TAP in trypsin-taurocholate-induced pancreatitis.
