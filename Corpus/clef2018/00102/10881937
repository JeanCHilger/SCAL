Induction of acute pancreatitis by cerulein in human IL-6 gene transgenic mice. Whether acute pancreatitis induced by cerulein was aggravated in human interleukin 6 (IL-6) transgenic mice and whether a specific anti-IL-6 receptor antibody improved pancreatitis were investigated. To induce acute pancreatitis, cerulein (50 microg/kg, seven injections) with or without 1 mg/kg lipopolysaccharides (LPS) was injected intraperitoneally every hour. In some mice, a monoclonal anti-IL-6 receptor antibody was administered before the first cerulein injection. The animals were killed 1 hour after the last injection. The pancreatic wet weight induced by cerulein alone was significantly higher in IL-6 transgenic mice compared with wild-type mice, but pretreatment with a specific anti-IL-6 receptor antibody did not reduce interstitial edema. When cerulein was administered with LPS, the pancreatic wet weight increased much more than when pancreatitis was induced by cerulein alone in both genotypes, and pretreatment with the anti-IL-6 receptor antibody decreased the pancreatic edema only in human-IL-6 transgenic mice. These results suggest that anticytokine antibodies may be effective in improving acute pancreatitis.
