Characteristics of acute pancreatitis in University Kebangsaan Malaysia. We analyzed the characteristics of patients presenting with acute pancreatitis to our unit. A total of 71 patients were admitted to the Surgical Department at University Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) over a period of seven years, between January 1990 to December 1996 with acute pancreatitis. There was a fourfold increase in incidence of acute pancreatitis in our hospital from January 1990 to December 1996. The commonest identifiable aetiology was gallstones followed by alcohol. There were two deaths. We conclude that acute pancreatitis is increasingly being diagnosed in our local population. This may be due to either greater awareness or changes in lifestyle of the population.
