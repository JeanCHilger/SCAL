Involvement of the pancreas in AIDS: a prospective study of 109 post-mortems. Pancreatic involvement in AIDS is rarely mentioned in medical literature.To identify the main morphological patterns of the pancreas using optical and electron microscopy in AIDS patients.An open, prospective, and sequential study in a tertiary institutional hospital.Consecutive post-mortems of 109 AIDS patients and 38 controls (1995). Baseline characteristics of AIDS patients and controls were evaluated. Morphological analysis consisted of: (i) semi-quantitative score of acinar and parenchymal elements (ii) qualitative analysis of ducts, vascular components, nerves, and Langerhans' isletsThe mean age of AIDS patients was 37 years 80% were malePancreatic involvement in AIDS is very frequent (90%) and is usually asymptomatic. Morphological changes showed three patterns of pancreatic alterations: 'nutritional-like', inflammatory and both of these together. The 'nutritional-like' pattern (atrophy, few zymogen granula and steatosis) may be due to many factors such as nutritional characteristics (Kwashiorkor-like) induced by the HIV infection or related to the HIV virus itself.
