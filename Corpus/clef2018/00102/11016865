Temporary elevation of pancreatic lysosomal enzymes, as a result of the omeprazole-induced peripancreatic inflammation in male Wistar rats. Omeprazole is one of the substituted benzimidazoles, which is not free of side effects. The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of omeprazole therapy on pancreas. Omeprazole was administered intraperitoneally, twice a day, for 3 days to the male rats in 0.571 mg/kg b.w. and 5.71 mg/kg b.w. doses. Half of animals were sacrificed in the 4th day of the experiment. The remaining rats were raised for another 6 weeks, without any xenobiotics, and sacrificed on the 47th day. The activity of acid phosphatase, beta-galactosidase, cathepsin B, and L, lipase, N-acetyl-glucosaminidase, and sulphatase was evaluated. The slides of the pancreas were examined in light microcopy in hematoxylin-eosin, asan, periodic acid-Schiff (paS) stains. Statistical increase in total activities of acid phosphatase, beta-galactosidase, lipase, N-acetyl-glucosaminidase, sulphatase, and acute inflammatory infiltration in peripancreatic fat tissue without histological pancreas impairment, were observed after the higher dose on the 4th day of experiment. Histological picture and enzymatic profiles were normalized during the next 6 weeks. We concluded that intraperitoneal administration of omeprazole causes tissue inflammation in the peripancreatic lipid tissue and reactive elevation of some pancreatic lysosomal enzymes.
