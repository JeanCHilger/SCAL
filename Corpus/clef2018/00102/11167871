Procalcitonin strip test in the early detection of severe acute pancreatitis. Early identification of patients who subsequently develop severe acute pancreatitis would enable the selection of patients who may benefit from early intensive management. Because severe acute pancreatitis is characterized by the development of systemic inflammation the authors studied whether procalcitonin, a marker of systemic inflammation, differentiated between patients with mild and severe acute pancreatitis.On admission and 24 h thereafter, serum procalcitonin level was measured by a rapid, semiquantitative PCT-Q test and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) by an immunoturbidimetric method in a consecutive series of 162 patients with acute pancreatitis. There were 38 severe and 124 mild cases. The accuracy of procalcitonin and CRP in predicting severe acute pancreatitis was compared with that of Ranson and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores.The PCT-Q test was more accurate in predicting severe acute pancreatitis (sensitivity 92 per cent and specificity 84 per cent at 24 h) than CRP, APACHE II score and Ranson score. Its negative predictive value was high (97 per cent at 24 h), and it detected each patient who developed subsequent organ failure (n = 22).The PCT-Q test was a useful screening method for detecting severe acute pancreatitis. It is simple and quick to perform and, unlike currently available multiple factor scoring systems, can easily be adopted into routine clinical practice.
