Pancreatitis in children infected with human immunodeficiency virus. The incidence of pancreatitis in HIV-infected children is not well known. Medical records of 42 children with HIV infection followed at Children's Hospital during a 6-year period were reviewed. Pancreatitis (elevated serum lipase levels) developed in 10 children (23.8%). Three children acquired HIV infection from vertical transmission and seven from contaminated blood products (hemophiliacs). Nine were severely immunosuppressed (CD4+ of < 100 cells/mm3). Lipase values were more often elevated than amylase values. The clinical course was protracted and severe in two children, one had four recurrences, and seven had only a single episode of pancreatitis lasting a few weeks. Opportunistic infections were present in four children and seven were receiving medications previously implicated as cause of pancreatitis. Discontinuation of dideoxynosine (ddI) in one child led to rapid resolution of pancreatitis, but continuation of medications in the other children did not alter the course. The etiology of pancreatitis may be multifactorial. Severe and prolonged clinical course is associated with advanced HIV infection. Determination of serum lipase is more useful than serum amylase for identifying those with pancreatitis.
