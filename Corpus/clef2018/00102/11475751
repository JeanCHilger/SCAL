An experimental study on curative effect of Chinese medicine qing yi tang in acute necrotizing pancreatitis. To observe the curative effect of the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) Qing Yi Tang (QYT) in acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP).Twenty three dogs were randomly divided into 3 groups. In control group (n = 7), animals underwent laparotomy only. In ANP group (n = 8), acute necrotizing pancreatitis was induced by injection of 0.5 ml/kg 5% sodium taurocholate with 300 u/kg trypsin into the pancreatic duct. While in TCM group (n = 8) were fed everyday with QYT after onset of ANP. All animals were sacrified 7 days later and organs were gathered and cultured. Mucosal and luminal floras of the intestine were analysed. Pancreas and ileal mucosa were examined histologically and ultra-microscopically, the levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and amylase in blood were determined.In TCM groups, histologic and ultra-structural damages in pancreas and ileal mucosa were much milder as compared with those of ANP group. In ANP group, there was a significant increase of E. coli and bacterocoids, and a significant decrease of bifidobacteria, lactobacilli and enterococci in the intestinal mucosa, while in TCM groups, these changes were alleviated significantly (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). As compared with ANP group, the bacterial translocation (BT) rate was reduced from 100% to 50%, and the counts of translocated bacteria were decreased 10-40 times, the levels of LPS and amylase reduced 2 to 3 times.TCM recipe QYT showed their protective effects on gut barrier function by alleviating the damage of intestinal mucosa and microecologic disturbance following acute pancreatitis. As a result, the chances of BT and enterogenic infection declined. These preparation might be promising in the prophylaxis and treatment of infection complicating ANP.
