Early microcirculatory derangement in mild and severe pancreatitis models in mice. An in vivo microscopic technique was used to clarify the increase in microvascular permeability and enhanced leukocyte-endothelium interaction of pancreatic microcirculation in experimental pancreatitis of differing severity. Using bovine albumin fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFDASE) as tracers, the change in permeability and the behavior of leukocytes in the acinar microcirculation were quantified during the initial 1, 2, 6, and 12h after the induction of caerulein pancreatitis in mice. Cold stress was added to produce the severe model. It was revealed that the early microcirculatory changes in the pancreas of caerulein pancreatitis included the increased permeability of endothelial lining and an accumulation of extravasated fluid in the perilobular space, which were more severe if cold stress was added. A decrease in flow velocity was also noted 2h after the onset of severe pancreatitis. Leukocyte adherence to the endothelial cells was not observed during the first 12h in either model of severity. In contrast, observation of the hepatic microcirculation revealed a significant number of adherent leukocytes 2h after the induction of severe pancreatitis. These results suggest that during the early course of acute pancreatitis, leukocyte adherence in the pancreatic microcirculation is a secondary event following the increase in pancreatic vascular permeability.
