Early diagnosis and intensive care of acute postoperative pancreatitis. Diagnostic algorithm developed on the basis of multifactorial regression analysis is suggested for more objective diagnosis of acute pancreatitis after operations on the hepatopancreatoduodenal organs. This algorithm helps differentiate the strategy of intensive care in patients with pancreatitis, pancreatic disease, and uneventful postoperative period. It is impossible to single out the specific (pathognomonic) clinical signs of this complication during the immediate postoperative period. Hyperamylasemia and changes in other enzymes are important but not absolute markers of unfavorable course of disease.
