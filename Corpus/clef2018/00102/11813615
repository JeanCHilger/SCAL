Evaluation of hemostatic changes and blood antioxidant capacity in acute and chronic pancreatitis. We examined changes in hemostasis, in levels of total antioxidant capacity, and pancreatic enzymes (amylase, lipase) in patients with pancreatitis 1, 3 and 7 days after admission to the clinic, in order to evaluate the inflammatory processes in acute and chronic pancreatitis and to identify new prognostic markers.The rate of CD62 expression--a marker of platelet hyperactivity--and the rate of platelet-leukocyte aggregates were measured by flow cytometry. The connection between the parameters measured and the severity of pancreatitis and also the differences of the parameters in acute and chronic pancreatitis were investigated.On the basis of previous studies it was assumed, that there is a connection between the level of parameters measured and the inflammatory process in the pancreas, and also between the defending processes of the body against free radicals.Based on our results, we suggest to extend the laboratory measurements to the investigation of hemostatic parameters. The measurement of plasma level of fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor and the rate of platelet activation is especially important.
