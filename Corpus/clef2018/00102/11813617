The significance of the dosage adjustment of octreotide in the treatment of acute pancreatitis of moderate severity. Octreotide is a novel semisynthetic analogue of somatostatin mainly indicated for acute necrotizing pancreatitis. The aim of the present study was to define its role in the treatment of acute pancreatitis of moderate severity.One hundred and twenty patients were randomly assigned to three groups of treatment receiving octreotide subcutaneously 100, 200 or 300 micrograms t.i.d. for seven days. Physical examination and biochemical monitoring were performed daily.No differences were found between the three groups of patients regarding the rate of rebound of leukocytosis and of the elevated serum and urine amylase levels within normal limits. Patients receiving 300 micrograms t.i.d. presented an earlier relief of pain than all others whereas patients receiving octreotide at a dose of either 200 micrograms or 300 micrograms t.i.d. had a shorter duration of hospitalization (12 days) than those receiving octreotide at 100 micrograms t.i.d. (19 days).The subcutaneous administration of octreotide in acute pancreatitis of moderate severity might be of little benefit only at a dose of 200 micrograms t.i.d. or 300 micrograms t.i.d. for at least seven days.
