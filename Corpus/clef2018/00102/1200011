Pancreatic ascites. A case report and review of the literature. A case of pancreatic ascites is reported and compared with 55 previously reported cases. A 42-year-old black male chronic alcoholic presenting with abdominal pain was found at operation to have chronic pancreatitis with no pseudocyst formation or overt duct disruption, in contrast to the majority of cases reported. The diagnosis and differentiation from cirrhosis of the liver were based on the operative findings, elevated serum amylase level, ascitic fluid amylase value, and protein content. Surgical exploration alone has proven beneficial--the patient has done well in the past 2 years with no recurrence of the ascites and continued weight gain. The clinical course was compatible with pancreatitis although the radiographic and angiographic studies were not diagnostic. It is suggested that the clinical entity of pancreatic ascites occurs more often than reported and a workup for it should be done even in the face of unconvincing radiographic and angiographic evidence.
