Evaluation of pancreatic forceps biopsy by laparoscopy in healthy beagles. The effects of laparoscopic biopsies were determined in four healthy laboratory beagles. Biopsies were taken from the pancreas of three dogs and from the peripancreatic fat of one dog. Clinical examinations and blood sampling for hematologic and biochemical tests were performed before laparoscopy and weekly throughout each dog's participation in the study (7 or 21 days). No clinical signs of pancreatitis were observed, and hematologic and biochemical parameters remained within normal limits in three dogs. One dog exhibited a transient increase in trypsinlike immunoreactivity, amylase, and lipase. Minor adhesions between the pancreas, small intestine, and peritoneum were observed macroscopically in this dog. Histologically, granulation tissue and a mild nonsuppurative inflammation in the pancreas were present. No abnormal changes were seen macroscopically or histologically in the other two dogs for which pancreatic biopsies were performed. Thus, laparoscopy appears to be safe, with neither permanent abnormalities in blood parameters nor changes in clinical health occurring during or after the procedure in healthy beagles.
