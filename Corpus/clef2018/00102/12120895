The influence of epidermal growth factor on the course of ischemia-reperfusion induced pancreatitis in rats. Acute pancreatitis is accompanied by the enhanced expression of EGF in the pancreas and the administration of EGF was found to exhibit the beneficial effect on edematous cerulein-induced pancreatitis. Therefore, we decided to determine the influence of EGF on necro-hemorrhagic pancreatitis induced by ischemia and reperfusion (I/R). Acute pancreatitis was induced in rats by restricting the pancreatic blood flow (PBF) in the inferior splenic artery for 30 min using microvascular clips. EGF was administered three times daily (10 microg/kg per dose s.c.) starting immediately after the clips removal. Rats were sacrificed on day 1, 3, 5, 10 and 21 following ischemia. PBF was measured using a laser Doppler flowmeter. Morphological signs of pancreatitis, as well as the levels of plasma amylase, lipase, interleukin-1beta and interleukin-10 concentration and pancreatic cell proliferation were examined.Ischemia with reperfusion caused acute necro-hemorrhagic pancreatitis with a histological and biochemical manifestation of pancreatic damage, followed by a spontaneous regeneration. The administration of EGF caused the reduction in the histological signs of pancreatic damage, such as necrosis, edema and leukocyte infiltration, and accelerated the pancreatic repair. Also, EGF treatment significantly attenuated the reduction in pancreatic blood flow and DNA synthesis. The activity of plasma amylase and lipase, as well as plasma interleukin-1beta and interleukin-10 concentrations were decreased in EGF treated animals.EGF exerts beneficial influence on the course of I/R induced pancreatitis and this effect seems to be related to the reduction in the activation of pro-inflammatory interleukin cascade, the improvement of PBF, and the increase in pancreatic cell growth.
