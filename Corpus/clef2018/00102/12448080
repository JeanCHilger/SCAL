Effect of metabolic disorders accompanying gastroenteritis on the pancreatic exocrine function in piglets. B. Disturbances of the pancreatic exocrine function in piglets with gastroenteritis. The study was performed on 90 piglets of both sexes, aged from 21 to 42 days. The control group consisted of 30 healthy piglets, the experimental one included 60 piglets with symptoms of gastroenteritis. Clinical and biochemical tests were performed on all the animals at the age of 21 and 35 days, and 7 days after weaning. Biochemical examinations allowed to determine the total serum activity of amylase and lipase, and the amylase salivary and pancreatic fractions. The total activity of amylase and lipase was also determined in pancreatic homogenates. A biochemical feces analysis (pH and fat content) and a D-xylose test were made in 20 piglets from each of the groups. The results obtained revealed failure of the pancreatic exocrine function in the piglets with gastroenteritis. A decrease in the total amylase activity, resulting from hypoactivity of its pancreatic fraction, was observed in the experimental animals. It was also found that indirect function tests cannot be applied to evaluate the pancreatic exocrine function in piglets with diarrhea.
