Effects of moderate hypothermia on proinflammatory cytokine production in a rat model of caerulein-induced pancreatitis. Proinflammatory cytokines act as mediators of the local and systemic manifestations of acute pancreatitis (AP).To investigate whether moderate hypothermia (MH) (32 degrees C) can reduce the severity of AP by inhibiting cytokine production in a rat model of caerulein-induced pancreatitis.Rats were divided into three groups: control rats (Group I), AP rats treated with normothermia (38 degrees C) (Group II), and AP rats treated with MH (Group III). AP was induced by intramuscular injection of caerulein and intraperitoneal infusion of lipopolysaccharide. MH was induced 4 hours after the first caerulein injection. Serum interleukin (IL)-1beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-6, amylase, and lipase levels were determined 8 hours after the first injection. The pancreas and lung were examined histologically.MH in comparison with normothermia significantly reduced serum levels of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6, amylase, and lipase. Histologically, the MH group showed less vacuolization of the acinar cells and cellular infiltration into the interacinar areas of the pancreas than were shown in the normothermia group, but these effects were not evident in the lung.Our results suggest that MH may be clinically applicable for reducing the severity of AP.
