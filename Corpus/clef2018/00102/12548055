Management of childhood pancreatic disorders: a multidisciplinary approach. Data on therapeutic endoscopy and radiologic interventions for the management of childhood pancreatic disorders are relatively limited. This study focuses on the multidisciplinary approach to the management of pancreatitis in children.Children with pancreatic disorders were studied from January 1992 to May 2001. Acute pancreatitis (AP) was diagnosed by clinical evaluation, serum amylase more than three times normal, and morphologic abnormalities of the pancreas on imaging. Children with recurrent abdominal pain, pancreatic calcification or ductal stones on imaging, and pancreatic ductal changes on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) were diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis (CP). Patients were treated by gastroenterologists, surgeons, and interventional radiologists. Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency was diagnosed in appropriate settings.Fifteen children--6 with AP (posttrauma, 3 gallstone disease, 1A multidisciplinary approach of radiologic and endoscopic interventions and surgery are complimentary to each other in achieving successful outcomes of complicated childhood pancreatitis.
