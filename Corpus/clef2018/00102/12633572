Contribution of circulating leukocytes to cytokine production in pancreatic duct obstruction-induced acute pancreatitis in rats. Little information is available regarding the role of circulating leukocytes in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis (AP). Our aim was to explore the time-course of the potential role of inflammatory peripheral blood (PB) cells during AP induced in rats by pancreatic duct obstruction (PDO). Flow cytometry immunophenotyping was used to analyse the distribution of the major circulating leukocyte subsets, the activation state of circulating monocytes as reflected by both CD11b expression and TNF-alpha production and the relative contribution of T-cell derived pro- (TNF-alpha) and anti- (IL-10) inflammatory mediators at different stages of PDO-induced AP. A progressive increase in PB neutrophils and monocytes was observed up to 6h after PDO whereas lymphocytes, as well as CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell subsets, rose as early as 1.5 h after PDO and decreased thereafter. Monocytes were activated in PB from 6 h after inducing AP as reflected by increases in both CD11b expression and spontaneous TNF-alpha production nevertheless, they showed the capability of producing TNF-alpha at earlier AP stages by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. In contrast, T-cells were unable to produce TNF-alpha during AP neither spontaneously nor after stimulation with PMA/Ionomycin. Therefore, only PB monocytes contribute to increase TNF-alpha levels in plasma as observed from 12 h onwards after inducing AP. Interleukin-10 was produced by T-cells 6 h after PDO only after PMA/Ionomycin stimulation. We conclude that systemic inflammatory events are triggered off at early stages of PDO-induced AP, with the activation of circulating monocytes, though not T-cells, playing a central role.
