Acute pancreatitis complicated with periappendicitis. Colonic complications of severe acute pancreatitis are quite uncommon and always occur in the transverse colon and splenic flexure. Here we report the case of a 47-year-old male with mild acute pancreatitis (Ranson's score 1) who suffered from acute right lower quadrant pain during hospitalization. After conservative treatment failed, he underwent open appendectomy under the impression of acute appendicitis. However, the pathology revealed only periappendicitis. Small bowel ileus was noted on plain film of the abdomen and a high ascitic lipase level was found during operation suggesting that the periappendicitis resulted from the spreading of the pancreatic inflammatory exudate via the small bowel mesentery route. This report suggests that although rare, periappendiceal involvement mimicking acute appendicitis remains possible in even mild acute pancreatitis.
