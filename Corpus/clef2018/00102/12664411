Abnormal pancreatic isoamylases in the serum of children with choledochal cyst. To investigate the changes of pancreatic isoamylases in the serum of children with choledochal cyst.Serum and bile from 20 children with choledochal cyst were studied for total amylase activity and isoamylases. Using electrophoresis, the assay of pancreatic isoamylases was expressed by peak appearance rate (PAR) and ratio of isoenzyme activity (RIA). Serum from 20 healthy children and 12 adults with acute pancreatitis served as a comparison.The total amylase activity in the serum of children with choledochal cyst was slightly higher than that of healthy controls, but dramatically lower than that of acute pancreatitis. The serum of children with choledochal cyst showed 5 pancreatic peaks (PAR: P1, 100 % P2, 100 %Abnormal pancreatic isoamylases, especially P4 and P5, are found in the serum of patients with choledochal cyst, which would point to a reflux of pancreatic juice into the biliary tract.
