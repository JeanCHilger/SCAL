Acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis in the dog. IV. Treatment with vasopressin. Acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis was experimentally induced in the dog by the closed-duodenal-loop technique. The disease process was modified and partially reversed by intravenous infusions of vasopressin, as indicated by some of our tests for pancreatitis as well as histologic examination of the pancreas.
