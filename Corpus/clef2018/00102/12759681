Are the causes similar for benign and severe forms of acute pancreatitis?. The frequency of severe acute pancreatitis not due to alcohol or biliary causes is not well known.To evaluate the distribution of causes responsible for benign and severe cases of acute pancreatitis in an effort to identify causes to search for in patients with severe acute pancreatitis.All patients hospitalized for acute pancreatitis between January 1994 and May 2001 with a good quality CT scan.All patients had a complete, standardized evaluation to look for all possible causes of acute pancreatitis. The following severity criteria were retrospectively reviewed: maximal C-reactive protein level, Ranson's score, Balthazar's score, percentage of patients hospitalized in intensive care unit or a high-dependency unit, hospitalization duration, and local or general complications.One hundred thirty-nine patients were included. The cause of acute pancreatitis were: alcohol (34%), biliary (27%), obstructive (16%), miscellaneous (10%), unknown (9%), post endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (4%). The studied severity factors did not differ with respect to the cause of acute pancreatitis with the exception of Balthazar's score. Non-alcoholic non-biliary causes were found in 19 (27%) of the 71 patients with severe necrotic acute pancreatitis (Balthazar > or =D) and 35 (51%) of the 68 patients with acute pancreatitis with Balthazar score<D (P<0.009).Non-alcoholic and non-biliary causes are less frequent in necrotizing pancreatitis (Balthazar > or =D). For the other severity scores, the distribution of causes was similar. After exclusion of biliary and alcoholic causes, a careful search for other etiologies should be carried out in both benign and severe cases of acute pancreatitis.
