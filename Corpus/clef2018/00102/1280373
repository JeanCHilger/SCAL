Cytotoxic effects of cyclosporin A on the exocrine pancreas in rats. The current study was done to evaluate the subacute toxic effects of cyclosporin A (CS) on the exocrine pancreas and the protective effect of potent protease inhibitor camostate (FOY-305). CS administration (15 milligrams, twice a day) for 14 days caused a significant increase in serum amylase levels, pancreatic amylase and cathepsin B content and mild acinar cell vacuolization and interstitial edema. CS also caused the redistribution of cathepsin B activity from the lysosomal fraction to the zymogen fraction, indicating colocalization of lysosomal enzyme with pancreatic digestive enzymes. The administration of camostate (150 milligrams per kilogram, twice a day for 14 days) almost completely prevented the toxic changes induced by CS. These results indicate that CS induces exocrine pancreatic injury and that lysosomal enzymes play important roles in the pathogenesis of the injury. The results also suggest the usefulness of camostate in protecting the exocrine pancreas in patients treated with CS after organ transplantation, because it can inhibit some proteases that are closely involved in the fragility of the subcellular organelles.
