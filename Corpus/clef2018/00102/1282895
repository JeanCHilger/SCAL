Toxic effects of oxygen-derived free radicals on rat pancreatic acini an in vitro study. Isolated pancreatic acini were incubated with either a combination of xanthine and xanthine oxidase which generates superoxide (O2), or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and the direct cytotoxic effect of active oxygen species on the pancreatic acini was examined in vitro in the isolated pancreatic acini system of the rat. Both amylase secretion and lactic dehydrogenase discharge were increased dose-dependently by the addition of xanthine and xanthine oxidase, and suppressed by the addition of a superoxide scavenger, superoxide dismutase. In addition, amylase and lectate dehydrogenase discharge was increased dose-dependently by hydrogen peroxide and decreased by catalase. These results suggest that superoxide and hydrogen peroxide directly injure pancreatic acinar cells and that active oxygen species are involved in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis.
