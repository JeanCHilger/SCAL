Hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis--treatment with heparin and insulin. Heparin and insulin stimulate lipoprotein lipase and are known to decrease serum triglyceride levels. However, their efficacy in hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis is not well documented. We report a 51-year-old man in whom treatment with heparin and insulin was accompanied by reduction in serum triglyceride levels and resolution of pancreatitis.
