Create the mouse model of severe acute pancreatitis induced by caerulein plus lipopolysaccharide and study on its pathogenesis. To set up a nontraumatic and convenient mouse model of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). Caerulein(Cn) was injected the mice intraperitonealy with lipopolysaccharide(LPS). Serum amylase and pancreas weight were measured in experiment. The pathological changes of pancreas and other organs were observed under light microscope. The ultrastructure of acini were observed under transmission electron microscope (TEM). Serum NO concentration were measured and the SOD and MDA in pancreas were examined. The results in Cn + LPS group were showed that serum amylase, NO concentration and pancreas weight were increased, SOD deduced and MDA increased. Severe edema, inflammation infiltration, necrosis and different extent of hemorrhage were showed. The acini were damaged severely. And the lesion of other organs were also happened. In Cn group, there were only pancreatic interstitial edema but no parenchmal necrosis or hemorrhage, and the other organs were normal. In LPS group, pancreas were almost normal and the organs besides pancreas were only showed light inflammation infiltration. The SAP mouse model induced by caerulein plus LPS has the same pathological characteristics of human SAP, which can be used in human SAP research. The unbalance of oxygen free radical release-elimination and oxidation-antioxidation mechanisms might be involved in the pathogenesis of mouse model of severe acute pancreatitis induced by intraperitoneal injection of caerulein plus LPS.
