Capecitabine-induced pancreatitis. A 47-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer developed acute pancreatitis while receiving capecitabine. She had been receiving capecitabine 2000 mg/m2/day however, when the dosage was increased to 2500 mg/m2/day (the maximum dosage approved by the Food and Drug Administration) she experienced abdominal pain and cramping. These symptoms were followed by nausea and vomiting, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (hand-foot syndrome), and mucositis, resulting in admission to the hospital. Laboratory tests for liver function showed elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase. The patient's lipase and amylase levels were also elevated, but an abdominal ultrasound was normal. After bowel rest and intravenous hydration, the patient's liver function tests and lipase and amylase levels returned to normal. Many chemotherapeutic agents have been documented to cause pancreatitis
