"Cocktail" therapy for acute pancreatitis: combined therapy of protease inhibitor, xanthine oxidase inhibitor and platelet activating factor antagonist in rat caerulein-induced pancreatis. A supramaximal dose of caerulein (5 micrograms/kg.hr for 3.5 hours) caused an acute pancreatitis with marked hyperamylasemia and intense interstitial edema in rats. In this model of pancreatitis, the redistribution of lysosomal enzyme in acinar cells as well as the increased lysosomal and mitochondrial fragility were also observed. The combined therapy of a low molecular weight protease inhibitor, FOY, a synthetic platelet activating factor (PAF) antagonist, CV 6209, and a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, allopurinol produced more significant improvements in all the parameters examined than the therapy of any only one of these three agents, each only one therapy exerting a partial significant protective effect. These results indicate that several factors, such as unknown proteases activities, PAF and oxygen-derived free radicals may be involved in the pathogenesis of pancreatic injuries in this caerulein-induced pancreatitis. These results also suggest that such a combined therapy of different kinds of agents, whose therapeutic mechanisms are also different, is useful in the clinical treatment of acute pancreatitis.
