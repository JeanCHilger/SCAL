The adaptational-compensatory reactions of the digestive system during the development of pancreatic atrophy. Adaptive-compensatory processes have been revealed in the digestive system in pancreatic atrophy. These processes promote: a) the compensation of the pancreatic enzymatic insufficiency and of the cavitary digestion decrease by the alpha-amylase adsorbed at the small intestinal epithelium, b) the increasing of the intestinal pH, c) the keeping up of the postprandial levels of gastrointestinal hormones.
