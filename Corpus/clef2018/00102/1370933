Evidence for a role of free radicals by synthesized scavenger, 2-octadecylascorbic acid, in cerulein-induced mouse acute pancreatitis. To define the role of free radicals and of lipid peroxide involvement during the progress of cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in mice, we evaluated the effect of a novel free radical scavenger, 2-octadecylascorbic acid (CV-3611), on pancreatic edema formation, and the levels of serum enzymes (amylase, lipase) and of lipid peroxide in pancreatic tissue. Mice were divided into three groups: control group, intraperitoneal injection of saline only pancreatitis group, cerulein 50 micrograms/kg injected intraperitoneally six times at 1-hr intervals
