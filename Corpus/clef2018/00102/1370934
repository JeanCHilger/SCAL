Cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in the rat. Study of pancreatic secretion and plasma VIP and secretin levels. A study was made with different doses of cerulein (2, 4, 10 and 20 micrograms/kg) administered subcutaneously to rats by four injections at intervals of 1 hr the aim of this work was to study exocrine pancreatic secretion of the rat under cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis, analyzing enzyme and hydroelectrolyte secretion of pancreatic juice. A further aim was to study the relationship between the dose of cerulein and the plasma levels of peptides controlling hydroelectrolyte secretion of the pancreas, like secretin and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). At the lowest dose schedule, the amounts of total protein and enzymes (amylase and trypsin) in pancreatic juice decreased significantly, plasma amylase increased, and the pancreas became edematous. Higher doses magnified these effects. By contrast, ductular function (flow and HCO3-) was well preserved in cerulein-treated rats, and this was probably due to the significant increase in plasma levels of immunoreactive secretin whereas VIP levels were unchanged. The secretin released by treatment with cerulein is able to palliate the lack of flow from acinar origin that is affected in the process of acute pancreatitis, being a beneficial response to the cerulein treatment.
