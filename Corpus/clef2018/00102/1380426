Effects of long-acting somatostatin analog (SMS 201-995) on eicosanoid synthesis and survival in rats with acute necrotizing pancreatitis. The effects of a long-acting somatostatin analog (SMS 201-995) were studied in an established model of acute necrotizing pancreatitis in rats. SMS 201-995, when given prior to induction of pancreatitis, decreased the mortality rate from 100% to 40% (P = 0.0001). When treatment was given after induction of pancreatitis, the mortality rate was 75% (P = 0.2). Administration of SMS 201-995 did not influence the serum concentrations of amylase markedly, but the lipase levels were significantly lowered (P less than 0.05). The low levels of serum insulin and the glucose level in whole blood were not influenced. The volume of ascitic fluid was reduced (P less than 0.01). Moreover, less peritoneal fat necrosis was seen, suggesting a reduction in toxic factors in the ascitic fluid. Treatment with SMS 201-995 prior to induction of pancreatitis caused a significant increase in the levels of circulating 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, the stable metabolite of prostaglandin I2 (P less than 0.01). The levels of thromboxane B2 and prostaglandin E2 did not change significantly. The present data support the hypothesis that SMS 201-995 is an activator of prostaglandin I2, thereby modifying the course of the disease.
