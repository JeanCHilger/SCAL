Clinical validity of a continuous colorimetric method for serum lipase. The clinical validity of a continuous colorimetric method for measuring pancreatic lipase was assessed. 1,2-Diacylglycerol containing long-chain fatty acid residues was used as substrate, and the method was adapted to a discrete analyser. The dynamic range was ascertained up to at least 30-fold the upper reference limit. Precision tests on three control sera yielded overall CVs of 4.6% (mean value 21 U/l), 2.4% (115 U/l), and 1.0% (386 U/l), respectively. Using serum samples from normal subjects and patients with pancreatic and non-pancreatic disorders, the present method was compared with a turbidimetric method (r = 0.997 n = 281) and a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay (r = 0.987
