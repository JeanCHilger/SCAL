Possibilities of the use of trypsinogen activation peptide in the pancreatic tissue in the diagnosis of pancreatic necrosis. The test of peptide of trypsinogen activation (PTA) in various biological media is a principal new diagnostic test for acute pancreatitis. PTA levels in the pancreatic tissue and the plasma of the blood in acute experimental pancreatic necrosis reflects the process of the pathological activation of trypsin in the diseases focus and confirms the source of higher levels of activation peptide in the blood flow. Together with the values of other enzymatic systems of the pancreatic gland the discussed value permits one to make a more precise assessment of the mechanism and stages of autodigestive processes which develop in acute experimental pancreatitis.
