Attenuated cerulein-induced pancreatitis in nuclear factor-kappaB-deficient mice. Nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB plays a central role in acute pancreatitis. We studied cerulein (CER)-induced pancreatitis in NF-kappaB knockout (KO) mice. NF-kappaB KO mice and normal control littermate wild-type (WT) mice were given four hyperstimulating doses of cerulein every hour to elicit secreatagogue-induced pancreatitis. Malonildialdehyde activity, glutathione levels, myeloperoxidase activity, TNF-alpha, and NF-kappaB binding activity and its inhibitory protein IkappaBalpha were studied in the pancreas. Furthermore, we measured plasma lipase and amylase and the histological damage. KO mice had reduced malonildialdehyde levels (WT + CER = 4.083 +/- 0.95 micromol/g KO + CER = 1.513 +/- 0.63 microol/g), decreased myeloperoxidase activity (WT + CER = 19.3 +/- 2.39 mU/g
