The influence of the development of diabetes mellitus in patients with chronic pancreatitis on exocrine pancreatic function measured by secretin-caerulein test. Diabetes occurs in 20-30% of patients above forty years old with chronic pancreatitis (CP). The aim of the present study was to determine the relationship between development of diabetes mellitus in CP patients and insufficiency of pancreatic exocrine secretion as well as changes in composition of pancreatic juice. Ninety CP patients with diagnosis confirmed by endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) were studied. They were divided into 3 groups in dependency on ERP changes (according to Cambridge classification) and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT): group A--equivocal or mild changes in ERP and normal OGTT (control group) group B--moderate or marked changes in ERP and normal OGTT: group C--moderate or marked changes in ERP and diabetes mellitus. The exocrine pancreatic function was determined by the secretin-caerulein testAll exocrine pancreatic function parameters were diminished in B and C groups compared with A group--differences were statistically significant. However in group C values of volume and bicarbonate, protein and amylase activity were especially low.Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is strongly associated with anatomical changes of the pancreas but also depends on endocrine function.
