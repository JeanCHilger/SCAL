Administration of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin-4-sulfate limits endogenous antioxidant depletion and reduces cell damage in experimental acute pancreatitis. Several reports have described a loss of endogenous antioxidants and molecular oxidative damage during acute pancreatitis. Since hyaluronic acid and chondroitin-4-sulfate possess antioxidant properties, the effect of the administration of these glycosaminoglycans in a cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in rats was investigated. Cerulein administration produced pancreatic edema and a marked increase in serum lipase and amylase activity induced a severe depletion of reduced glutathione, catalase, and superoxide dismutase levels
