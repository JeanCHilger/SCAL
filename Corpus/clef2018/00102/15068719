Protective effect of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration on tissue and organ damage in patients with severe acute pancreatitis. To explore the protective effect of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) on tissue and organ damage induced by severe acute pancreatitis (SAP).Thirty-seven SAP patients were randomly divided into CVVH group (n=22) and control group (n=15). Patients in control group were treated with conventional therapy, while patients in CVVH group were treated with conventional therapy combined with CVVH. Serum amylase (AMS) and lipase (Lip), the plasma levels of endotoxin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), and C-reactive protein (CRP), and faecal occult blood test and blood serum leukocyte were determined. Functions of brain, kidney, liver, heart and lung were observed.The treatment effect was better in CVVH group than that in normal group. The mortality rate was lower and the number of hospitalization day was decreased in CVVH group than those in normal group, they were 18.2 percent vs. 33.3 percent and (18.3+/-5.7) days vs. (27.5+/-8.6) days.CVVH has a significant protective effect against tissue and organ damage induced by SAP.
