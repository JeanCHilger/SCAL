Dysregulation of the calpain-calpastatin system plays a role in the development of cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in the rat. Calpain, a calcium-dependent cytosolic cysteine protease, is implicated in a multitude of cellular functions but also plays a role in cell death. Recently, we have shown that two ubiquitous isoforms, termed micro-calpain and m-calpain, are expressed in rat pancreatic acinar cells and that calcium ionophore-induced calpain activation leads to acinar cell injury. On the basis of these observations, we have now investigated the role of both calpain forms and the endogenous calpain inhibitor calpastatin in acute pancreatitis. After treatment of rats either without or with calpain inhibitor Z-Val-Phe methyl ester (ZVP 60 mg/kg i.p.), pancreatitis was induced by cerulein injections (10 microg/kg i.p.
