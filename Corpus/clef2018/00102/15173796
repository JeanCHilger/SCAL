A simple way of avoiding post-ERCP pancreatitis. Pancreatitis occurs in up to 30% of patients who undergo ERCP. This study tested the hypothesis that post-ERCP pancreatitis can be avoided by initially accessing the bile duct with a soft-tipped Teflon tracer 0.035-inch guidewire.A single endoscopist performed ERCP in 400 consecutive patients with pancreatobiliary disease who were randomized to two groups. In Group A (200 patients), the bile duct was first accessed by insertion of a soft-tipped Teflon tracer (diameter 0.035 inch) guidewire through a 6F, double channel sphincterotome, followed by cannulation, injection of contrast, and sphincterotomy. In Group B (200 patients), the bile duct was opacified by using traditional methods of cannulation.No case of acute pancreatitis was detected in Group A, whereas, 8 cases were observed in Group B (6 mild, one moderate, one severe) (p < 0.01). In 9 patients in Group A vs. 39 in Group B (p < 0.001), the serum amylase rose to more than 5 times the upper normal limit during the 24 hours after the procedure. There was no procedure-related mortality.Accessing the bile duct with a soft-tipped tracer guidewire prevents post-ERCP pancreatitis.
