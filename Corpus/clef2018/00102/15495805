Concentration changes of amylase in vitreous humor of acute pancreatitis associated with different postmortem interval in rabbits. To investigate concentration changes of amylase in rabbits vitreous humor of acute pancreatitis associated with postmortem different interval.To induce animal model of acute pancreatitis with sodium taurocholate, observed concentration changes of amylase after different postmortem interval, then compared with normal.The concentration of amylase in vitreous humor of rabbit 24h after death were related to postmortem interval significantly The concluded formulae of the relationship between postmortem interval and amylase concentration is y=8.7420+0.7699x-0.0083x2 (R2=92.62792, F=14.89734, P=0.001).Concentration changes of amylase in vitreous humor of acute pancreatitis associated with postmortem interval may provide a new sensitive and objective method for the forensic early injury time estimation.
