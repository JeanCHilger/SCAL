Postoperative pancreatic fistula following distal pancreatectomy for pancreatic neoplasm can pancreatic fistula be prevented? Pancreatic fistula is a potentially fatal complication in pancreatic surgery. The objective of this study was to analyze the incidence of pancreatic fistula in patients who underwent distal pancreatectomy for pancreatic neoplasm.Forty-seven patients who underwent distal pancreatectomy for neoplasm of the pancreas at Kochi Medical School between October 1981 and December 2002 were studied. Comparative analysis was carried out to identify the correlations between the incidence of pancreatic fistula and parameters of preoperative evaluation, intraoperative procedure, and postoperative laboratory investigation.The incidence of pancreatic fistula in patients who underwent distal pancreatectomy for pancreatic neoplasm was 27.7%. Intraoperatively, the frequency of pancreatic fistula was significantly high in patients who underwent distal pancreatectomy without lymph node dissection and ligation of the splenic artery. No significant difference was recognized between the conventional surgical division and auto suture staple groups, however, in the ultrasonically activated scalpel (USAS) group, no pancreatic fistula was observed. A multivariate analysis revealed that independent high incidence of pancreatic fistula were 1) the situation of the tumor at pancreatic body, 2) the procedure of D2 lymph node dissection, and 3) the ligation of the root of splenic artery. In the group with the presence of pancreatic fistula, the serum amylase level on the first postoperative day was significantly higher than that in the group without fistula.Our findings supported that pancreatic fistula may be preventable by use of the USAS and treatment of acute pancreatitis in the early postoperative stage.
