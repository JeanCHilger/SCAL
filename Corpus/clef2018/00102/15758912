High-dose allopurinol for prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis: a prospective randomized double-blind controlled trial. Pancreatitis is the most common major complication of diagnostic and therapeutic ERCP. Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor that blocks generation of oxygen-derived free radicals, potentially may prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis. This study assessed the efficacy of high-dose oral allopurinol for prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis.A prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 250 patients undergoing ERCP. Patients were randomized to receive allopurinol (600 mg) or placebo orally at 15 and 3 hours before the procedure. Patients were clinically evaluated, and serum amylase levels were determined before ERCP and at 6 and 24 hours thereafter. Standardized criteria were used to diagnose and to grade the severity of post-ERCP pancreatitis.A total of 243 patients were included in the analysis. The two groups were similar with regard to age genderPretreatment with high-dose, orally administered allopurinol decreases the frequency of post-ERCP pancreatitis. Despite the promising results of this prospective, randomized trial, further studies are needed to verify these observations before allopurinol can be recommended for routine clinical use.
