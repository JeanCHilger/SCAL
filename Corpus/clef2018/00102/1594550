Involvement of endogenous cholecystokinin in pancreatic regeneration after cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis. This study was undertaken to determine the involvement of endogenous cholecystokinin (CCK) in the regeneration of pancreatic tissue after cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis treated by the CCK receptor antagonist L364,718. Acute pancreatitis was induced in rats by s.c. injections of cerulein in gelatin (12 micrograms/kg) three times a day for 2 days with controls receiving saline in gelatin. Rats were then divided into four treatment groups: saline-dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (SD), saline-L364,718 (SA), cerulein-pancreatitis-DMSO (CD), and cerulein-pancreatitis-L364,718 (CA). In the first experiment, rats were treated for 3 or 10 days with DMSO or L364,718 (0.1 mg/kg, twice a day). In the second experiment, rats were treated for 13 days with DMSO or L364,718 (1.0 mg/kg, twice a day). After the rats were killed, pancreata were weighed and evaluated for their total protein, amylase, chymotrypsin, RNA, and DNA. We found that destruction of the pancreatic tissue occurred after cerulein-induced pancreatitis and that regeneration of the tissue was in progress but incomplete after 10 days the low dose of L364,718 did not prevent regeneration. After 13 days, regeneration was still incomplete but the 1-mg dose of L364,718 strongly inhibited spontaneous regeneration. These data suggest that endogenous CCK is an important and potent trophic factor in the regeneration process of pancreatic tissue following an episode of acute pancreatitis.
