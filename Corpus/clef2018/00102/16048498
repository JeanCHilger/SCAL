DIC secondary to acute pancreatitis. Various hematological abnormalities including fall in serial values of hemoglobin or hematocrit, coagulation factor abnormalities, leukocytosis, acute hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or hemolytic uremic syndrome have been reported in patients with acute pancreatitis. Similarly, abnormalities of blood coagulation factors consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) have also been noticed in patients with pancreatitis. We report a case of a 33-year-old female with acute pancreatitis who presented with one episode of epistaxis and abnormal prothrombin time and partial prothrombin time. Coagulation work-up revealed thrombin time 24.3 s fibrinogen 110 mg/dl, D-dimers >1 and < 2, and fibrin degradation products >22. Pancultures did not show any evidence of infection. The patient maintained a normal renal and mental status during her illness. Her D-dimers continued to decrease with resolution of acute pancreatitis as evidenced by decreased abdominal pain, relief of nausea, control of vomiting, and decrease in serum amylase and lipase levels. This case report suggests that coagulation abnormalities are encountered in patients with acute pancreatitis. It is hypothesized that such hemostatic abnormalities may be related to early intravascular consumption of coagulation factors secondary to circulating pancreatic enzymes, particularly trypsin, or secondary to vascular injury. Recognition of these hematological complications including DIC is paramount. Physicians caring for these patients should be aware of such a complication of acute pancreatitis.
