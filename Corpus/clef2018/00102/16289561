Aqueous extract of black tea (Camellia sinensis) prevents ethanol+cholecystokinin-induced pancreatitis in a rat model. Black Tea Extract (BTE), a phytocompound has been attributed with a plethora of health-promoting actions. We have previously demonstrated that BTE inhibits chronic hepatitis in a rat model induced with high-fat and ethanol (EtOH). This study reports that BTE prevents altered pancreatic acinar cell functions, oxidative stress, inflammatory changes and DNA damage in the EtOH+cholecystokinin (CCK)-induced model of pancreatitis. The EtOH+CCK model rats were administered with BTE, and were examined the activity of pancreatic digestive enzymes (amylase and lipase), proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-alpha), oxidative and antioxidative enzymes (nitric oxide, NO malondialdehyde, MDA
