Total enteral nutrition as prophylactic therapy for pancreatic necrosis infection in severe acute pancreatitis. To evaluate the capacity of enteral nutrition, in comparison with the total parenteral nutrition (TPN) plus antibiotic therapy, for avoiding pancreatic necrosis infection in the severe acute pancreatitis.In the period between October 1998 and September 2003, 87 patients met the inclusion criteria and took part in this research. Within the first week from their admission, 43 patients received TPN and 44 patients received total enteral nutrition (TEN). An adequate prophylactic antibiotic therapy was used in both groups. The severity of the manifestations was similar for both groups having a tomographic 'severity index' of 8 and an entry C-reactive protein of 208 and 203 mg/l, respectively.The group that received TPN suffered an organ failure in 79% of the cases, while the percentage showed by the group that received TEN was 31% 88 and 25% of the patients in each group requiring a surgical intervention, respectively (p < 0.001). There was decreased presence of pancreatic necrosis infection in the group of patients that was supplied with TEN (20%) than in the group receiving TPN, where it reached 74% (p < 0.001). The death rate was significantly higher among the patients who received TPN, (35%), while for the patients who received TEN it was only 5% (p < 0.001).TEN could be used as a prophylactic therapy for infected pancreatic necrosis since it significantly diminished the necrosis infection as well as the mortality.
