Changes in the morphology of the acinar cells of the rat pancreas in the oedematous and necrotic types of experimental acute pancreatitis. Limited experimental models of the oedematous and necrotic types of acute pancreatitis provide some understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease. Wistar rats were treated with cerulein at 10 mg/kg of body weight or with L-arginine at 1.5 or 3 g/kg of body weight in order to induce the oedematous or necrotic type of acute pancreatitis. After the induction period we examined samples of pancreata with light and electron microscopes. Morphological examination showed profound changes in the histology of the pancreas and its acinar cells and subcellular structures, especially in the group of rats which received a higher dose of L-arginine, amounting to 3 g/kg body weight. These included parenchymal haemorrhage and widespread acinar cell necrotic changes. 4-OH-TEMPO successfully prevented morphological deterioration as well as amylase release, suggesting that the severity of the two types of disease strongly depends on the intensity of the oxidative stress. Our results lend support to the assumption that reactive oxygen species play an axial role in the pathogenesis of both types of acute pancreatitis.
