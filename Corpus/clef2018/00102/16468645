Impact of Chai Qin Cheng Qi Decoction on cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway in rats with severe acute pancreatitis. To test the change of true choline esterase (TChE) and cholineacetyltransferase (ChAT) and their correlation with interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and the impact of Chai Qin Cheng Qi Decoction (CQCQD) on cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway in rats with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). Methods Thirty SD rats were randomly divided into three groups: control group (pseudo-operated), SAP group and CQCQD-treated group, each with 10 rats. Blood samples were taken six hours after injection of testing agents for biochemical test, which included the test of amylase, TNF-alpha, IL-6, TChE, and ChAT.The rats in SAP group had higher levels of serum IL-6, TNF-alpha and TChE and lower levels of serum ChAT than those in control group (P < 0.05). The serum IL-6 was positively correlated with TChE (r = 0.95, P = 0.000) and negatively correlated with ChAT (r = -0.91, P = 0.000). The TNF-alpha was also positively correlated with TChE (r = 0.93, P = 0.000) and negatively correlated with ChAT (r = -0.95, P = 0.004). The rats in CQCQD-treated group had lower levels of serum IL-6, TNF-alpha and TChE and higher levels of serum ChAT than those in SAP group (P < 0.01). The increase of white blood cell, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase was observed in the control group first and followed by the CQCQD-treated group and SAP group sequentially (P < 0.05). Conclusions Cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway plays an important role in the pathological changes of SAP in rats. CQCQD can relieve the systemic inflammatory response syndrome and reduce the functional damage of organs through interference on the cholinergic antiinflammatory pathway. More studies are needed to reveal the mechanism of such impact.
