Principles of conservative treatment of severe acute pancreatitis. The main principles of conservative treatment of severe acute pancreatitis include early diagnosis of the disease, diagnosis of its severe form and assessment of the etiology of pancreatitis, replacement of fluids, adjustment of the milieu int√©rieur, administration of antibiotics in patients with confirmed necroses, in particular if they exceed 25 - 30%, early endoscpic treatment of pancreatitis with a biliary etiology, adequate nutrition, prevention and treatment of complications. The diagnosis of pancreatitis is based on clinical examination, biochemical evidence of elevated amylase and lipase concentrations and on the imaging of the pancreas. In the severe form necroses of the pancreas are present or other local complications and/or organ dysfunction. As regards assessment of the etiology rapid diagnosis of biliary pancreatitis is fundamental as it leads to therapeutic consequences. Fluid replacement should not be discontinued even during transport and diagnostic procedures. Infection remains the main cause of mortality in patients who got over the hypovolaemic stage of pancreatitis. Antibiotics are therefore indicated in all patients with necroses or biliary infection. Systemic complications include renal failure, pulmonary failure, coagulopathy, cardiac and hepatic failure--frequently manifested as combined multiple organ dysfunction. Local complications such as pseudocysts, abscesses, compression conditioned stenoses of the bile ducts or haemorrhage from impaired visceral arteries are treated as a rule in an interdisciplinary manner with preference of less invasive procedures. Clinical deterioration of patients in particular the development of multiple organ failure in patients with extensive infiltrates and necroses is caused in the great majority of cases by infection of necroses and is an indication for early, usually surgical intervention.
