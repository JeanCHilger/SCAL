Somatostatin in the treatment of established and severe acute pancreatitis in the rat. The effects of somatostatin (SS) on the treatment of acute pancreatitis were studied in rats. Acute pancreatitis was established by injecting 5% sodium taurocholate in the biliopancreatic duct. Previously, pancreatic necrosis was determined in this experimental model at several intervals without treatment. Treatment was started according different groups: at 12, 16 and 20 hours after induction of acute pancreatitis (IV bolus of 4 ug/kg body weight followed by a 24h continuous infusion of 4 ug/kg body wt/hour). When somatostatin was initiated at 12 or 16h a decrease in serum amylase and lactodehydrogenase was observed, as well as in pancreatic necrosis resulting in 0% mortality after 24h of treatment. When somatostatin was started at 20h there was no changes in the lethal outcome of the disease.
