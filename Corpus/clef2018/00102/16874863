Pancreatic regenerating protein (reg I) and reg I receptor mRNA are upregulated in rat pancreas after induction of acute pancreatitis. Pancreatic regenerating protein (reg I) stimulates pancreatic regeneration after pancreatectomy and is mitogenic to ductal and beta-cells. This suggests that reg I and its receptor may play a role in recovery after pancreatic injury. We hypothesized that reg I and its receptor are induced in acute pancreatitis.Acute pancreatitis was induced in male Wistar rats by retrograde injection of 3% sodium taurocholate into the pancreatic duct. Pancreata and serum were collected 12, 24, and 36 h after injection and from normal controls (4 rats/group). Reg I receptor mRNA, serum reg I protein, and tissue reg I protein levels were determined by Northern analysis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and Western analysis, respectively. Immunohistochemistry was used to localize changes in reg I and its receptor.Serum amylase levels and histology confirmed necrotizing pancreatitis in taurocholate treated rats. There was no statistically significant change in serum reg I concentrations from controls. However, Western blot demonstrated increased tissue levels of reg I at 24 and 36 h. This increase was localized primarily to the acinar cells and the ductal cells by immunohistochemistry. Northern blot demonstrated a significant increase in reg I receptor mRNA expression with pancreatitis. Immunohistochemistry localized this increase to the ductal cells, islets, and acinar cells.Acute pancreatitis results in increased tissue reg I protein levels localized to the acinar and ductal cells, and a parallel threefold induction of reg I receptor in the ductal cells, islets, and acinar cells. These changes suggest that induction of reg I and its receptor may be important for recovery from acute pancreatitis.
