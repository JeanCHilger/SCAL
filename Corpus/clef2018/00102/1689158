Nonoxidative metabolism of ethanol in the pancreas implication in alcoholic pancreatic damage. Alcohol dehydrogenase activity and fatty acid ethyl ester synthase activity were measured in various organs of male Wistar strain rats. The mean (+/- SE) values of alcohol dehydrogenase activity in liver, testis, pancreas and brain were 223 +/- 34, 35 +/- 13, 27 +/- 17 and 24 +/- 15 nmol/hr/mg protein, respectively, but not detectable in heart and skeletal muscle. Fatty acid ethyl ester synthase activity in pancreas, liver, testis and heart were 1348 +/- 263, 23 +/- 14, 17 +/- 3 and 2 +/- 1 nmol/hr/mg protein, respectively, but not detectable in brain and skeletal muscle. Alcohol dehydrogenase activity, fatty acid ethyl ester synthase activity, fatty acid ethyl ester content and amylase activity were measured in pancreas of rat after 7 weeks of ethanol feeding. Compared with control rats, ethanol-fed rats had normal fatty acid ethyl ester synthase activity and alcohol dehydrogenase activity. However, fatty acid ethyl ester content increased five-fold and amylase activity decreased up to 20% of the control group. Fatty acid ethyl ester content was inversely correlated with amylase activity. These results suggest that fatty acid ethyl ester may be responsible for the development of pancreatic damage by ethanol.
