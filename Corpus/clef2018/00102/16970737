Altered laboratory findings associated with end-stage renal disease. Several laboratory parameters can be altered in advanced renal failure. Results may be difficult to interpret and may become misleading and unreliable in such a context. On the other hand, some of the alterations may reflect real abnormalities. Thus sufficient knowledge and careful judgment are required by the clinician. We reviewed different publications related to biochemical anomalies in renal failure and report some of the main findings. The sections are divided as follows: cardiovascular risk factors and markers, inflammation markers, pancreatic and liver function tests, hormones, bone turnover indices and parathyroid hormone assays, tumor markers, carbohydrate metabolism indicators, and others. The information provided should be useful to clinicians involved in the care of renal failure patients.
