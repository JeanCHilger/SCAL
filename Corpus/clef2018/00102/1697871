Pentamidine-induced acute pancreatitis in a patient with AIDS. We report pentamidine-induced acute pancreatitis in a patient with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The course of this pancreatitis was prolonged but favorable. Pentamidine was detected in serum as late as one month after discontinuation of therapy. The special pharmacokinetics of this drug may account for the potential severity of pentamidine-induced acute pancreatitis.
