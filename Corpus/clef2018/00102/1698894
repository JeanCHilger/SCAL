Hypocalcemia in experimental pancreatitis occurs independently of changes in serum nonesterified fatty acid levels. Hypocalcemia and lipid abnormalities commonly occur in acute pancreatitis. Experimentally, increased plasma concentrations of free fatty acids (NEFA) can lower the serum calcium (Ca). We hypothesized that changes in blood-ionized calcium might parallel changes in NEFA concentration in pancreatitis. This hypothesis was tested in a model of severe necrotizing pancreatitis and a model of mild edematous pancreatitis. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (300-400 g) were randomized to receive: 100 microL sodium glycodeoxycholic acid (GDOC 34 mmol/L) infused into the pancreatic duct to produce severe necrotizing pancreatitis (Group 1) 100 microL 0.9% NaCl (NS) infused into the pancreatic duct (Group 2)
