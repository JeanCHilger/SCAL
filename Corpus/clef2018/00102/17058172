An increase in the serum amylase level in patients after peroral double-balloon enteroscopy: an association with the development of pancreatitis. Double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) is a novel technique that allows the enteroscope to be inserted deep into the small intestine. The procedure has been thought to be safe, but cases of acute pancreatitis after peroral DBE have recently been observed. The aim of this study was to confirm the occurrence of hyperamylasemia after peroral DBE.Peroral DBE was carried out in 13 patients from July 2005 to February 2006. Blood samples were taken before and 3 h after the procedure, and serum pancreatic amylase levels were measured. The patients were also evaluated for pancreatic-type abdominal pain after the procedure. Hyperamylasemia after peroral DBE was defined as an elevation of the serum pancreatic amylase level to more than the upper normal limit and twice the level before the procedure. Pancreatitis was diagnosed on the basis of both pancreatic-type abdominal pain and hyperamylasemia.Hyperamylasemia after peroral DBE occurred in six patients (46.2 %). One of the six patients with hyperamylasemia had pancreatic-type abdominal pain after the procedure and developed acute pancreatitis. The average procedure time was 105 min (range 65 - 155 min) in the patients with hyperamylasemia, and did not significantly differ from that in the group without hyperamylasemia (99 min).Hyperamylasemia after peroral DBE occurs frequently and may be associated with development of pancreatitis.
