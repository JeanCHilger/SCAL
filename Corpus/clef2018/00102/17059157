Intrabiliary rupture of the hydatic cyst complicated with acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis is a rare complication of hydatidosis, and only few reports were published previously. We report a case of a 17-year-old man, with recurrent liver hydatid cyst, who presented with severe upper abdominal pain, vomiting, jaundice. Amylase and bilirubin were elevated. Abdominal CT scan showed a cystic lesion in the dome of the liver and a diffusely swollen pancreas. At endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) the common bile duct was dilated with fragments of hydatid membrane. A sphincterotomy was performed and hydatid membranes were extracted, after which the patient made an uneventful recovery and the level of amylase and bilirubin normalized. After two weeks a new episode of hydatid rupture occurred with clinical presentation of cholangitis. Emergency surgery was performed, which consisted of cystectomy, suture of intracavitary bile fistula, omentoplasty, choledochotomy with extraction of the hydatid membranes and common bile duct drainage. There were no relapses during 5 years follow-up. This case report highlights that ERCP and sphincterotomy are considered the procedures of choice in acute pancreatitis induced by biliary rupture of the hydatid cyst and surgical treatment is considered to be the only definitive treatment of the hydatic cystic lesion of the liver with intrabiliary rupture.
