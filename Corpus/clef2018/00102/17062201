Cystic pancreatic tumors. Review of literature and proposal of a diagnostic-therapeutic pathway. In this paper the Authors consider the epidemiological, clinical, pathological, instrumental, chemical and physical findings of every type of pancreatic cystic lesions. They perform a critical examination of each of them. In this way, they can identify the most important features of every single class. A pathway consisting in four main groups of instrumental and chemical tests (abdominal ultrasonography / EUS, CT, MR, FNA / biopsy/ assay of tumoral markers and amylase of cystic fluid) was chosen to know all these informations according to careful principles of specificity, sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy taken from international scientific literature. In each subgroup of cystic pancreatic tumor, at last, the most reliable therapeutic project is suggested according to the common international scientific agreement.
