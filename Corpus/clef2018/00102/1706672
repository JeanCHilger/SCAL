The diagnostic value of serum pancreatic phospholipase A2 (PLA2) in pancreatic diseases. The diagnostic significance of serum immunoreactive pancreatic phospholipase A2 (PLA2) was studied in 119 patients with pancreatic disease, 200 with various non-pancreatic disease, and 203 healthy controls using radioimmunoassay (RIA) specific to human pancreatic PLA2. This newly developed RIA using monoclonal antibody was satisfactorily sensitive and reliable. Serum PLA2 was elevated in all six patients with acute pancreatitis. Frequency of abnormal serum PLA2 levels was 60% in chronic pancreatitis (n = 52) and 67% in pancreatic cancer (n = 61). Serum PLA2 levels were low in chronic pancreatitis with severe exocrine insufficiency and advanced pancreatic cancer. In chronic pancreatitis, patients with low serum PLA2 level showed lower enzyme output in secretin test than patients with normal or high serum PLA2 level. Frequency of abnormal PLA2 levels was 27% in non-pancreatic disease and, in particular, patients with renal failure showed high PLA2 levels. Sensitivity (62%) and efficiency (69%) of serum PLA2 assay in pancreatic disease were superior to those of amylase. In conclusion, serum PLA2 determination using RIA was useful for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis by high serum PLA2 levels and the diagnosis of severe exocrine pancreatic insufficiency by low serum PLA2 levels.
