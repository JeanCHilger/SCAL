Non-surgical treatment of cysts and pseudocysts of the pancreas. A study of a series of 33 cases. Pancreatic cysts and pseudocysts had to be treated by surgery until 15 years ago. Nowadays they can be aspirated (or drained) either endoscopically or by ultrasonic and computed tomographic guided punctures. The aim of this study was to see if these non-surgical treatments were efficient enough among the actual treatments. From 1984 to 1988, 33 patients were admitted in one single institution with a pancreatic cyst or pseudocyst, 22 of which were a consequence on an acute pancreatitis and 11 complicated a chronic pancreatitis. Ten cysts were connected with the Wirsung channel while 11 others were not, but the ERCP failed to give any accurate information on this point in 12 cases. As a first treatment, we abstained of any invasive procedure in 9 cases, 18 were treated by percutaneous aspiration guided by ultrasound and 6 patients underwent surgery. The mean follow-up was 30 months. All the patients who had no treatment remained symptom free their cysts improved in 5 cases and disappeared in 4 cases. Among the cysts treated by percutaneous aspiration, 4 had to be operated, 5 disappeared, 3 improved and 6 recurred
