Effects of the seleno-organic substance Ebselen in two different models of acute pancreatitis. This study evaluated the effects of the seleno-organic substance Ebselen [2-phenyl-1,2-benzisoselenazol-3(2H)-one] in two models of acute hemorrhagic and acute edematous pancreatitis. Ebselen is known to catalyze glutathione peroxidase-like reactions and to inhibit lipid peroxidation. Hemorrhagic pancreatitis was induced by feeding a choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented (CDE) diet to mice for 66 h. Edematous pancreatitis was induced by 7-h subcutaneous injections of 50 micrograms/kg of cerulein in mice. Ebselen was given from the beginning of the CDE diet either as a subcutaneous injection of 100 mg/kg at 6-h intervals or was mixed in with the CDE diet to yield a daily dose of 100 mg/kg of Ebselen. In further experiments, Ebselen was given at various time intervals after the beginning of the CDE diet as subcutaneous injections of 100 mg/kg at 6-h intervals. In the cerulein model, Ebselen was given 5 min prior to each cerulein injection at doses from 10-500 mg/kg. Prophylactic administration of Ebselen given orally or subcutaneously significantly improved survival from 38.5% in the control group of saline-injected CDE-fed mice to 61.9 and 65.0%, respectively. Ebselen also reduced increases in serum amylase and pancreatic weight in the diet model. Therapeutic administration of Ebselen significantly increased survival only when injections were started 20 h after the beginning of the CDE diet (64%), but not when started after 40 h (44%). Similarly, increases in serum amylase and pancreatic weight due to the CDE diet were significantly reduced by Ebselen only when injections were started after 20 h but not when started after 40 h.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
