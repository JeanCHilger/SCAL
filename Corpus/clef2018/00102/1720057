Trophic response and morphological changes in pancreas of caerulein treated rats: dose and time dependent effects. The present study was performed to determine the effect of the duration of chronic caerulein administration given at different doses, on the rat pancreas. Four groups of rats, one treated with 0.9% NaCl (control) and the others with caerulein 2, 5 and 10 micrograms/Kg twice a day i.p. were used. After a treatment period of 15, 30 and 60 days, 6 rats from each group were anesthetized, the pancreas was removed, and growth and composition of pancreatic tissue were determined. Small samples were taken for histological examination. Caerulein induced pancreatic hyperplasia and hypertrophy. The dose of caerulein used and the length of the treatment did not significantly modify the trophic effect. Focal perivascular and periductular lymphomonocytic infiltrates associated with cellular abnormalities were seen at 30 and 60 days. The results suggest that 1) the trophic effect of caerulein is not dose-and-time dependent and 2) morphological abnormalities can appear during long term treatment with CCK analogous.
