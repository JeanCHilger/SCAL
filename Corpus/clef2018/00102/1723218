Influence of diet composition on the late course of acute pancreatitis. Experimental study in rats. Acute pancreatitis was induced with sodium taurocholate 1% in two lots of rats fed during 21 days with diets that differed in lipid composition. Serum amylase, pancreatic tissue enzymes (trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen and amylase), pancreatic tissue nucleotides (RNA and DNA) and biopsies for histological study were collected in normal pair fed animals, and in the experimental lots 1, 4, 7 and 15 days after AP was induced. ANOVA and Student t-test were used for the comparison of biochemical data (p less than 0.05). They showed that acute pancreatitis aggravated progressively until the fourth day independently of the regimen. On the 15th day, the histological and biochemical parameters reached normal values. The authors concluded that high lipidic diet was not the main factor responsible for progressive injury of the pancreas.
