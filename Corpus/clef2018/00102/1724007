Cellular alterations of parotid gland of rats with acute pancreatitis induced by cerulein. To explore the cellular and subcellular alterations of the parotid gland during acute pancreatitis, we examined the redistribution of lysosomal enzyme, cathepsin B, along with the discharge of the LDH and cathepsin B from parotid acini of rats with acute pancreatitis induced by a supramaximal dose of cerulein (5 micrograms/kg/h for 3.5 h). Both the serum amylase level and parotid-gland amylase content were increased significantly in rats with acute pancreatitis. The dry-/wet-wt ratio ratio was significantly lower than in the control. In vitro studies showed that discharge of LDH from the parotid acini and leakage of cathepsin B from lysosomes in the acini were significantly higher than in the control. In addition, there was redistribution of the cathepsin B (shifting from the lysosomal pellet to the zymogen pellet) in the parotid gland. These results indicate that in acute pancreatitis there is edema and accumulation of amylase in the parotid glands, along with increased cellular and lysosomal fragility. Thus, there seems to be a close relationship between the exocrine pancreas and the parotid glands. Gut hormones, such as cerulein, also appear to play an important role in the pathophysiology of the parotid glands.
