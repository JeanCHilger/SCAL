The resorption of FITC-dextran 10,000 from the peritoneum in different modifications of bile-induced acute pancreatitis and in bacterial peritonitis. The resorption from the peritoneum of fluorescein-isothiocyanate-conjugated (FITC) dextran with a mol wt of 10,000 was studied after 6, 15, and 24 h in rats with (1) only laparotomy (LC), (2) bacterial peritonitis (BP), (3) bile-induced acute pancreatitis (AP), (4) acute pancreatitis induced with contaminated bile (AIP), and (5) cerulein administration during acute pancreatitis (CAP). Animals in the AIP and CAP groups had a significantly higher mortality rate at 24 h and higher hematocrit at 6 h, indicating severe disease in these animals. At 6 and 15 h, all groups displayed similar peritoneal resorption. After 24 h, all groups with active inflammation showed significantly higher resorption than laparotomy controls. We conclude that peritoneal resorption as defined is independent of the severity and mode of induction of acute experimental pancreatitis and that it is the same as in bacterial peritonitis.
