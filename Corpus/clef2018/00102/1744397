Ultrasound imaging of pancreatico-duodenal transplants. A preliminary investigation of the role of ultrasound, including color and duplex Doppler, was performed in recipients of cadaveric pancreatico-duodenal transplants. Twenty such examinations were done on three patients. Three different complications were noted: rejection, pancreatitis, and peripancreatic abscess. The mean normal resistive index (RI) was 0.71 +/- 0.12. The normal allograft anteroposterior (AP) dimension ranged from 1.5 to 2.0 cm. Intraparenchymal and main feeding vessels were demonstrated easily. RI calculations alone were not helpful in diagnosing graft rejection. However, this diagnosis can be made using a new biochemical marker, serum anodal trypsinogen. We conclude that when used in conjunction with a reliable biochemical marker for rejection (serum anodal trypsinogen), ultrasound, including color and duplex Doppler, provides an important adjunct for the rapid, inexpensive, and complete evaluation of patients with pancreatico-duodenal transplants.
