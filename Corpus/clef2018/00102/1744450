Clinical trial with a protease inhibitor gabexate mesilate in acute pancreatitis. To evaluate whether early administration of protease inhibitors could improve mortality and morbidity in acute pancreatitis (AP), we made a retrospective analysis of 23 patients with severe AP and 88 with mild to moderate AP who were treated in our institute and four affiliated medical centers during the 10-y period from 1980 to 1990. Intravenous infusion of a protease inhibitor, Gabexate Mesilate (FOY), was started within 24 h from onset of AP (early administration) in 17 patients with severe AP and 51 with mild to moderate AP. The remaining patients were put on FOY later than 24 h from onset of AP (late administration). Comparison of the mortality and morbidity between the two groups, early vs late administration of FOY, led to the following conclusions: (1) Early administration of FOY significantly improved mortality (29.4 vs 83.3%) in severe AP, although the improvement in mortality was not directly proportional to the shortening of the time lag between the onset of AP and the start of FOY, and (2) earlier administration of FOY brought about significantly earlier recovery of abdominal pain, hyperamylasemia, and leucocytosis in mild to moderate AP.
