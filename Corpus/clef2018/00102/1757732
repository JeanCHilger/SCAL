Influence of the CCK-antagonist loxiglumide on bile-induced experimental pancreatitis. The present study investigates the effect of CCK-receptor blockade on taurocholate-induced pancreatitis in rats using the potent antagonist loxiglumide. Intraperitoneal administration (50 mg/kg) of loxiglumide began 3 h before, or 10 min or 3 h after induction of pancreatitis. Mean survival times of the experimental groups were 31.2, 23.6, and 20.5 h, respectively, compared to 18.2 h for controls. Survival for 24 h after induction of pancreatitis was significantly improved when the antagonist was given 3 h before, but not in the time periods after induction. After 72 h, survival time was not significantly altered in any of the groups. Furthermore, amylase and lipase levels quantified 10 h after induction of pancreatitis in ascites, blood, or tissue did not indicate a significant difference, nor was improvement in survival seen when the CCK-antagonist was tested in rats receiving a basal treatment with intravenous volume substitution, peritoneal lavage, and protease inhibition. We conclude that CCK-receptor blockade does not improve the final outcome of bile-induced pancreatitis in the rat, even if treatment is started before induction of pancreatitis.
