Incidence and clinical significance of hyperamylasemia after endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) of pancreatic lesions: a prospective and controlled study. Acute pancreatitis as a complication of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) of pancreatic lesions is rarely observed. However, there is little information on the incidence of hyperamylasemia after EUS-FNA of the pancreas and its clinical significance. This study aimed to supply this lack of information.Patients who underwent EUS-FNA of a pancreatic lesion between October 2004 and October 2005 were studied prospectively. Exclusion criteria were: (i) platelet count under 50,000/mm (3) and/or prothrombin time < 50 % (ii) performance of surgery, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), a percutaneous biopsy attempt, or another invasive procedure within 7 days before EUS-FNAA total of 100 patients underwent EUS-FNA of a pancreatic lesion (58 men, 42 women mean age 60 +/- 13 years). Eleven patients (11 %) showed hyperamylasemia 8 h after the puncture (298 +/- 293 UI/L, range 105 - 1044 UI/L), but only two of them developed acute mild pancreatitis after EUS-FNA. Hyperamylasemia was not related either to the type of lesion (cystic or solid) or to its location, the duration of the procedure, or the number of passes performed.Pancreatitis after pancreatic EUS-FNA occurs in 2 % of patients, with some more cases of silent hyperamylasemia. This complication may have to be included in the information given to patients for their informed consent.
