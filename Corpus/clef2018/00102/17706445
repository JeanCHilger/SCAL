A novel complex deletion-insertion mutation mediated by Alu repetitive elements leads to lipoprotein lipase deficiency. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive inherited disorder, characterized by marked hypertriglyceridemia, eruptive xanthoma, hepatosplenomegaly, recurrent attacks of pancreatitis, and markedly low or absent LPL activity in postheparin plasma. A majority of LPL deficient patients have been reported to have point mutations in the LPL gene however, we find a complex deletion-insertion mutation by Alu elements, mobile retrotransposons, in a patient with LPL deficiency. This patient suffered from acute pancreatitis, showed chylomicronemia and lacked detectable LPL activity or mass in her postheparin plasma. Southern blot analysis and long-range PCR of the patient's DNA demonstrated a 2.2-kb deletion encompassing exon 2. Sequence analysis revealed (1) a 2.3-kb deletion between an AT-rich region adjacent to an Alu element in intron 1 and another Alu element in intron 2
