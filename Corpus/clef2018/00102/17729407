Preparation method of an ideal model of multiple organ injury of rat with severe acute pancreatitis. To establish an ideal model of multiple organ injury of rats with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP).SAP models were induced by retrograde injection of 0.1 mL/100 g 3.5% sodium taurocholate into the biliopancreatic duct of Sprague-Dawley rats. The plasma and samples of multiple organ tissues of rats were collected at 3, 6 and 12 h after modeling. The ascites volume, ascites/body weight ratio, and contents of amylase, endotoxin, endothelin-1 (ET-1), nitrogen monoxidum (NO), phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6) in plasma were determined. The histological changes of multiple organs were observed under light microscope.The ascites volume, ascites/body weight ratio, and contents of various inflammatory mediators in blood were higher in the model group than in the sham operation group at all time points [2.38 (1.10), 2.58 (0.70), 2.54 (0.71) vs 0.20 (0.04), 0.30 (0.30), 0.22 (0.10) at 3, 6 and 12 h in ascites/body weight ratio 1582 (284), 1769 (362), 1618 (302) (U/L) vs 5303 (1373), 6276 (1029), 7538 (2934) (U/L) at 3, 6 and 12 h in AmylaseThis rat model features reliability, convenience and a high achievement ratio. Complicated with multiple organ injury, it is an ideal animal model of SAP.
