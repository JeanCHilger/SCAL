Electroacupuncture protects against CCK-induced acute pancreatitis in rats. Electroacupuncture (EA) has been used to treat myalgia, adiposis and gastroenteropathy in Korea. EA as a complementary and alternative medicine has been accepted worldwide mainly for the treatment acute and chronic pain and inflammation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of EA on acute pancreatitis induced by cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK) in rats.Animals were divided into four groups: (1) a normal group (2) a CCK-induced acute pancreatitis groupEA significantly decreased the pancreatic weight/body weight ratio in CCK-induced acute pancreatitis, increased the pancreatic levels of HSP60 and HSP72, and decreased the beta-amylase and lipase levels associated with CCK-induced acute pancreatitis. Furthermore, the release of ACTH was increased in the blood serum of the EA-treated group.EA may have protective effects against CCK-induced acute pancreatitis through the release of ACTH.
