Exocrine pancreatic function in biliary tract pathology treated with the endoscopic methods. Incidence of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency in biliary pathology is estimated for about 30%. The objective was to assess pancreatic exocrine function in biliary tract pathology (cholelithiasis, strictures) before and after endoscopic treatment.Twenty-eight patients with choledocholithiasis and its complications (19F/9M aging 31-90 years, median: 69 years) were evaluated. Fecal elastase 1 concentration was measured using ELISA, before, early, and 6-8 weeks after endoscopic treatment. The inflammatory response of pancreas to the treatment was also assessed.Initial fecal elastase 1 concentration in patients (median 454 microg/g) was not significantly different as compared to the control (median 357 microg/g). Nine patients (32%) had low fecal elastase 1 concentration (below 250 microg/g) and out of them 6 had the concentration below 200 microg/g, suggesting impairment of exocrine pancreatic function. Endoscopic treatment was successful in 82% of patients. Pancreatic inflammatory response was noted only in one patient. After 6-8 weeks fecal elastase 1 concentration in the whole group of patients did not significantly change in comparison to the initial level. However, out of 9 patients with initially low fecal elastase 1 concentration (median 191 microg/g) at least in 6 pancreatic function improved (median 310 microg/g), P < 0.001.One third of the patients with biliary pathology had a low fecal elastase 1 concentrations, suggesting pancreatic dysfunction. In at least 2/3 of these patients successful endoscopic treatment of biliary pathology resulted in the significant increase of fecal elastase 1 concentration. Therefore, an additional positive effect of such treatment in some patients, could be an improvement of the exocrine pancreatic dysfunction.
