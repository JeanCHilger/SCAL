Chondroitin-4-sulphate reduced oxidative injury in caerulein-induced pancreatitis in mice: the involvement of NF-kappaB translocation and apoptosis activation. Activation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and caspases may greatly amplify inflammation and cell damage in addition to that directly exerted by free radicals. Since reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in acute pancreatitis, we studied whether the administration of chondroitin-4-sulphate (C4S), in addition to its antioxidant activity, was able to modulate NF-kappaB and caspase activation in an experimental model of caerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in mice. Hyperstimulating doses of caerulein (50 microg/ kg), five injections per mouse given at hourly intervals produced the following: high serum lipase and amylase activity lipid peroxidation, evaluated by 8-isoprostane concentrations
