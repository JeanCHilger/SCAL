Severity of post-ERCP pancreatitis directly proportional to the invasiveness of endoscopic intervention: a pilot study in a canine model. Pancreatitis complicates 1% - 22% of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography procedures. The study aims were to develop a reproducible animal model of post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP), and investigate the impact of endoscopic technique on severity of PEP.ERCP was carried out in six male hound dogs. Pancreatitis was induced by one of three escalating methods: 1) pancreatic acinarization with 20 - 30 mL of contrast 2) acinarization + ductal balloon occlusion + sphincterotomyDogs 1 - 4 developed clinical pancreatitis and hyperamylasemia (11 736 vs. 722 U/L, P = 0.02). Total injury scores were significantly elevated compared with controls (6.85 vs. 1.06, P = 0.004). There was significant increase in acinar cell necrosis (0.86 vs. 0.06, P = < 0.001), and all other categories (except fibrosis) demonstrated elevated injury scores . Dogs 5 and 6 developed clinical pancreatitis without significant hyperamylasemia total injury scores were elevated compared with controls (4.83 vs. 1.06, P = 0.01), but lower than in Dogs 1 - 4 (4.83 vs. 6.85, P = 0.25). There was escalating severity of pancreatic injury from Dogs 1 to 4 correlating with the method of endoscopic injury used.Severity of PEP is directly proportional to invasiveness of endoscopic intervention. Pancreatic acinarization, even without balloon occlusion and sphincterotomy, can be used as a reliable animal model for future studies investigating therapy and prevention of disease.
