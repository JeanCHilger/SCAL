Effect of the administration of monofluorophosphate on alpha-macroglobulin levels and the clinical course of pancreatitis in rats. Clinical course of pancreatitis depends partially on the proteinases-antiproteinases balance. Monofluorophosphate (CAS 10163-15-2, MFP) binds to plasmatic antiproteinase alpha-macroglobulin (AM), modifies its homeostasis and, as a consequence, has potential effects on the progression of pancreatitis and other inflammatory processes. The progress of incomplete closed duodenal loop induced pancreatitis was studied in rats with AM homeostasis perturbed by the oral administration of MFP. Twelve rats received 80 micromol MFP/day orally for one month before the induction of pancreatitis. Controls did not receive MFP. Plasmatic amylase activity and AM levels were measured. The day of death was recorded and histopathology of pancreas was performed. Higher survival and less histopathologic changes were observed in rats treated with MFP previous to pancreatitis compared to rats without MFP. Amylase activities were higher in controls and AM levels decreased significantly in controls respect to MFP-treated animals. Higher survival, lower amylasemia and less pancreatic damage in MFP-treated animals suggest a protective effect of the drug in the clinical course of pancreatitis.
