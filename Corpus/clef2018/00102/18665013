Protective effect of HMGB1 a box on organ injury of acute pancreatitis in mice. To investigate the effects of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) A box in experimental severe acute pancreatitis (SAP).Severe acute pancreatitis was induced by 20% L-arginine abdominal cavity injection in Institute of Cancer Research mice, and the treatment group received 2 abdominal cavity injections of A box 12 and 24 hours after the modeling injection. The serum levels of HMGB1, amylase, lipase, and biochemical indicators were measured 24 and 48 hours after induction of SAP. The pathological changes of the pancreas, lung, kidney, and liver for both SAP group and treatment group were observed and compared, as well as survival rate and surviving time.A box significantly improved the elevation of the serum levels of HMGB1, amylase, lipase, and biochemical indicators in SAP. The pathological changes of pancreas and organ injury in treatment group were more alleviated than that in SAP group. The mice survival rate of the treatment group (66.7%) was significantly higher than that of the SAP group (26.7%).A box has remarkable protective effect against pancreatitis and associated organ injury HMGB1 probably participates in the inflammatory reaction and organ injury of SAP as a late-acting mediator of inflammation.
