Effects of Chaiqinchengqi decoction on exocrine function of pancreatic acinar cells of acute pancreatitis rats. To investigate the effects of Chaiqinchengqi decoction(CQCQ-D) on exocrine function of pancreatic acinar cells and the changes of intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) of acute pancreatitis (AP) rats, so as to explore the mechanism of CQCQ-D.Acute pancreatitis model was induced in Sprague-Dawley rat by ligation of bile-pancreatic duct, pancreatic acinar cells were isolated by collagenase digestion and in vitro co-incubated with the drug serum containing Chaiqingchengqi decoction(CQCQ-S) which was collected from normal rats intragastrically fed on CQCQ-D, then the amylase activity secreted into the buffer was assayed and intracellular fluorescent intensity were observed and analyzed to investigate the changes of intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i).Amylase secretion in AP group was lower than that in sham-operation(SO) group (P < 0.01), while CQCQ-S treatment led to more significant decrease (P < 0.05) [Ca2+]i elevated in AP rats (P < 0.05), while the level of [Ca2+]i elevation was reduced after CQCQ-S treatment (P < 0.05).CQCQ-D has inhibitive effects on exocrine function of pancreatic acinar cells and the calcium overload of AP rats.
