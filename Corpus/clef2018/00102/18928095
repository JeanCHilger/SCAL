Effect of combined therapy with Sandostatin and yiyan mixture in treating severe acute pancreatitis. To observe the efficacy of combined therapy with Sandostatin (SDS) and Yiyan Mixture (YYM) in treating severe acute pancreatitis (SAP).Thirty-six patients with SAP were assigned to two groups equally, the treated group treated with the combined therapy and the control group treated by SDS alone. Biochemical indexes, including lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), amylase (AMY), endotoxin (ET), C-reactive protein (CRP), and APACHE II score were determined before and after treatment. And the incidence of complication and mortality were assessed.The time of abdominal pain, tenderness and distention disappearance, air charge recovering, and average hospitalization days in the treated group were significantly shorter than those in the control group respectively (P < 0.05). Levels of LDH, AST, AMY, serum ET, CRP and APACHE II scores were lowered after treatment in both groups, but the decrement was more significant in the treated group than that in the control group respectively (P < 0.05). The difference in incidence of local complications and mortality between the two groups showed no statistical significance (P > 0.05).Combined therapy of Sandostatin and YYM is a recommended recipe for treatment of SAP, it could obviously improve the condition of patients and enhance the efficacy of treatment.
