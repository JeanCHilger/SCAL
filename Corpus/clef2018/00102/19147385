Typhoid rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure and acute pancreatitis: a case report and review of the literature. We report a case of typhoid rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure and acute pancreatitis in a 23-year-old Vietnamese male who was admitted to the intensive care unit with a 15-day history of fever followed by severe abdominal pain. On examination, the patient was febrile and his abdomen was diffusely tender. Serum creatinine was 533 micromol/L, pancreatic amylase 1800 U/L and lipase 900 U/L the myoglobin blood level was high, which is associated with significant myoglobinuria. Blood, urine and stool culture yielded Salmonella enterica serovar typhi, which was sensitive to ceftriaxon, ampicillin and ciprofloxacin. Ceftriaxon was initiated for a total of 14 days. Subsequently, the patient maintained a good urine output with improved renal parameters and accordingly was discharged. In this report, we review the literature and discuss the pathogenesis of the disease thoroughly.
