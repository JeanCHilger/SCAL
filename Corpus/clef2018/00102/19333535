Erythropoietin: a possible cytoprotective cytokine in acute necrotizing pancreatitis. Despite decades of research and clinical trials, a specific therapeutic treatment for acute pancreatitis (AP) has yet to be developed. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of erythropoietin on the severity of taurocolic acid-induced acute necrotizing pancreatitis.Forty-seven male Wistar albino rats were randomized into seven experimental groups. In group I, animals were sham-operated (n = 5). In groups II, III, IV, IIepo, IIIepo, and IVepo, AP was induced by sodium taurodeoxycholate treatment (n = 7). In groups II, III, and IV, 1 ml normal saline and in groups IIepo, IIIepo, and IVepo, 1000 U/kg body weight erythropoietin (EPO) was administered intramuscularly immediately after the induction of AP. Animals were killed at 24, 48, and 72 h postoperatively. Histopathological and biochemical evaluations were performed.The serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tissue levels of malondialdehyde were found to be significantly lower in EPO-administered groups when compared with the levels in groups without EPO treatment. The severity of pancreatic edema, acinar necrosis, inflammation, and perivascular infiltrate were reduced in all the EPO groups compared with the no-treatment groups.Our findings may reflect the possible cytoprotective effect of EPO in acute necrotizing pancreatitis.
