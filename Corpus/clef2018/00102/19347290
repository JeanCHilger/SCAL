Peptide YY mediates inhibition of tumor growth and inflammation. Peptide YY (PYY) orchestrates the functions of the gut and the pancreas by regulating growth, digestion and absorption. In addition to its physiological role, PYY exhibits immune and antitrophic properties in the pancreas by decreasing cytokine and amylase release. Although the exact mechanism(s) of action are still incompletely understood, PYY interacts at the acinar level with numerous intracellular transcription factors. In addition to ameliorating pancreatic inflammation, novel synthetic analogs of PYY have been developed that are potent inhibitors of pancreatic cancer proliferation, in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, PYY and its analogs have been shown to inhibit the growth of breast, esophagus, and gastric cancer in vitro. We, herein, plan to review some of the methods employed in the laboratory while investigating the utility of PYY in the treatment of inflammation and cancer.
