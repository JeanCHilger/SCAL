A case of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus associated with diabetic ketoacidosis after the onset of hyperlipidemia and acute pancreatitis following alcohol abuse. We report here a case of diabetic ketoacidosis associated with hyperlipidemia and acute pancreatitis following alcohol abuse. A 23-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of right upper abdominal and back pain developing into a state of unconsciousness and shock. He had been drinking 720 ml of whisky daily for 4 years. Laboratory data on admission revealed metabolic acidosis (pH 7.01, PaO2 84.6 mmHg, PaCO2 41.1 mmHg, HCO3- 16.3 mmol/l, BE-16.4 mmol/l), a high blood glucose level (640 mg/dl), strongly positive urinary ketone bodies, hypercholesteremia (913 mg/dl) and hypertriglyceridemia (8500 mg/dl). Furthermore, the levels of pancreatic enzyme including serum amylase (770 U/l) and elastase I (2721 ng/dl) were elevated. After successful treatment of the diabetic ketoacidosis with insulin and fluid supplementation, serum cholesterol, triglyceride and pancreatic enzyme levels decreased concomitantly with stabilization of the blood glucose level. From these findings, it is suggested that hyperlipidemia might have caused the acute pancreatitis which developed into diabetic ketoacidosis in this patient.
