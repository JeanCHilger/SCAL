Effects of etanercept on sodium taurocholate-induced acute pancreatitis in rats. In this study, we examined the effects of etanercept (ETA) on experimentally induced pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis was induced with Na taurocholate. ETA was simultaneously administered to treatment groups. Serum amylase and lipase activity, pancreatic histopathology, apoptosis, malondialdehyde (MDA), and myeloperoxidase enzyme activity (MPO) were assessed. Although rats in the groups 1, 2, and 3 were sacrificed 24h later, groups 4, 5, and 6 were sacrificed 5 days later. ETA treatment significantly decreased serum amylase activity (nontreated, 2636.16+/-191.94 treated, 1898.71+/-262.53
