Severe acute liver and pancreas damage in anorexia nervosa. Anorexia nervosa, a syndrome most commonly affecting young women, is characterized by weight less than 85% of weight that is considered normal for that persons age and height, distorted body image, and fear of becoming obese, and its mortality is up to 9%. We present a case of a 33-year-old woman with a 9-year history of anorexia nervosa. She admitted to our institution with decreased mentality, and her body mass index was 11.5 kg/m2 of the time admission. Initial aminotransferase level was severely elevated, but it was normalized solely with improved nutrition and weight gain. Five and sixteen days after the admission urinary tract infection and elevation of pancreatic enzymes occurred. They were successfully treated with antibiotics and nutritional support. Fifty seven days after the admission, she discharged. We report a case of acute hepatitis and pancreatitis treated with nutritional rehabilitation in a patient with severe anorexia nervosa for the first time in Korea.
