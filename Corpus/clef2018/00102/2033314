The effect of platelet activating factor antagonist (BN 52021) on cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis with reference to oxygen radicals. Acute edematous pancreatitis was induced in Wistar male rats by iv infusion of cerulein (CR) in the dose of 5.10(-6)g.kg-1.h-1 during 3 or 6 h. The effect of BN 52021--platelet activating factor (PAF) receptor antagonist, against this model of disease was examined. BN 52021 was applied iv as a bolus injection in the dose of 5.10(-3)g.kg-1 at 0 time. Treatment with this agent significantly ameliorates cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in rats. The effect of BN 52021 was expressed by significant reduction of pancreas edema, diminution of hyperamylasemia, lack of superoxide dismutase activity depletion, and inhibition of lipid peroxidation in pancreatic tissue. These changes were accompanied by significant reduction of acinar cells vacuolization and remarkable inhibition of infiltration with inflammatory cells in the interacinar space. We suppose that beneficial effect of BN 52021 against cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in rats depends on the prevention of inflammatory cells activation and subsequent generation of oxygen radicals within pancreatic tissue.
