Protective effects of etanercept and methylprednisolone on pancreatic damage in cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis. To examine the pharmacological effect of etanercept and methylprednisolone (MP) on acute pancreatitis (AP) induced by cerulein in an experimental rat model.The present study was carried out in the Experimental Research Center, Ondokuz Mayis University, Samsun, Turkey between December 2008 and October 2009. Forty adult Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 5 groups (n=8): 1--sham, 2--cerulein induced pancreatitis (over 20 hours), 3--etanercept (5 mg/kg, intraperitoneal), 4--MP (10 mg/kg, intramuscular), 5--etanercept plus MP. The rats in groups 3, 4, and 5 were cerulein-induced pancreatitis at 20 hours, as well. After the treatment, the pancreas and blood were taken for histopathological and biochemical analysis.All cerulein-treated rats developed biochemical and histopathological AP after 20 hours. Histological findings of pancreatitis and serum levels of amylase and lipase were lower in group 5 compared to group 2. Pancreatic inflammation and total pathological score were statistically reduced in the tissues of the pancreas at 20 hours after the treatment of etanercept plus MP in group 5 compared to groups 2, 3, and 4.In the early stage of cerulein induced AP, the administration of etanercept plus MP attenuated pancreatic inflammation and significant damage in rats.
