Expression of NOD2 in a rat model of acute pancreatitis. To observe the expression of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) in rats with acute pancreatitis (AP).Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into sham operation (SO) groups and AP groups. Acute pancreatitis was induced with retrograde infusion of sodium taurocholate into the biliopancreatic duct. They were then killed at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours after induction of AP. Blood biochemical indicators were detected with automatic biochemistry analyzer. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) was measured by immunohistochemistry. The NOD2 was detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Compared with the SO group, the level of messenger RNA and protein of NOD2 in pancreatic tissue and peritoneal white blood cells (PWBCs) in the AP groups significantly declined (P < 0.05). The messenger RNA level of NOD2 in the AP groups was correlated positively with amylase (P < 0.05) and negatively with TNF-α (P < 0.05) TNF-α significantly decreased in the AP groups, whereas NF-κB significantly increased (P < 0.05).The NOD2 may play an important role in the up-regulation and activation of NF-κB during inflammation reactions in AP.
