A randomized controlled trial of valdecoxib and glyceryl trinitrate for the prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis. Efforts to prevent post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis have been largely unsuccessful. Cyclo-oxygenase-2 enzyme-mediated inflammatory pathway has been suggested in the pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis. Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) might prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis by relaxing the sphincter of Oddi.To evaluate the efficacy of valdecoxib, a cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitor, and GTN transdermal patch for the prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis.Patients undergoing first ERCP procedure from October 2003 to August 2005 were randomized to receive either 20 mg intravenous valdecoxib or GTN patch (10 mg/h) at the start of ERCP, or assigned to control group. The study followed CONSORT guidelines. Primary outcome measure was frequency of post-ERCP pancreatitis in the 3 groups.A total of 380 patients were randomized 121 patients in valdecoxib (group 1), 124 in GTN (group 2), and 126 in the control arm (group 3) were analyzed. There was no difference in the frequency of post-ERCP pancreatitis between the groups (12 each in groups 1 and 2, and 13 in group 3Valdecoxib and GTN were not effective for the prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis.
