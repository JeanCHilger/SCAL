Antioxidant and pancreas-protective effect of red mold fermented products on streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Red mold fermented products contain various antioxidants, and were mentioned in an ancient Chinese pharmacopoeia of medicinal food and herbs. They were considered useful for the treatment of diabetes. The objective of this study was to determine the antioxidant and pancreas-protective function of red mold fermented products on streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats.Throughout the experimental period (8 weeks), significantly (P < 0.05) lowered plasma glucose, amylase, triglyceride and cholesterol levels were observed in groups treated with red mold fermented products. Diabetic rats showed higher reactive oxygen species (P < 0.05) and lower activities of glutathione disulfide reductase, glutathione reductase and catalase (P < 0.05) in pancreas as compared to normal rats and those treated with red mold fermented products. There were some necrotic cells observed in the pancreas of diabetic rats and pancreatic tissue damaged by STZ in the red mold fermented products supplemented groups was ameliorated.These results indicate that red mold fermented products not only regulate hyperglycemia but also provide prevention against the effects of STZ-induced pancreatic damage.
