Endoscopic ultrasound-guided transmural cyst drainage (EUS-CD) was effective in a case of pancreatic pseudocyst with obstructive jaundice and duodenal stenosis. A 40-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of epigastralgia and vomiting. His condition was diagnosed as acute pancreatitis with a pancreatic pseudocyst, obstructive jaundice, and duodenal stenosis. Because he had fever, abdominal pain, and elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), endoscopic ultrasound-guided transmural cyst drainage (EUS-CD) was performed with a nasocystic tube on the 6th day. After the cyst was reduced and the patient recovered from the obstructive jaundice and duodenal stenosis, the nasal drainage tube was replaced with a plastic stent. Because a short extent of stenosis in the main pancreatic duct in the pancreatic head was found by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), a 5Fr pancreatic stent was placed to prevent pancreatitis. No recurrence of pancreatitis and the cyst occurred after removal of both stents 5 days later.
