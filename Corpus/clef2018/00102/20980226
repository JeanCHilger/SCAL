Acute pancreatitis caused by hypertriglyceridemia. Hypertriglyceridemia is reported to cause 1-7% of the cases of acute pancreatitis.The aim of the present study was to assess the clinical features and management of pancreatitis with hypertriglyceridemia in our tertiary center.Between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2009, patients with a diagnosis of hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis were reviewed. Patients with pancreatitis and serum triglyceride levels greater than 11.3 mmol/l (â‰ˆ1000 mg/dl) were included. Acute pancreatitis with other etiologies was excluded.26 patients (2 women, 24 men median age at presentation 42 yearsThe clinical course of acute pancreatitis with hypertriglyceridemia does not differ from acute pancreatitis of other causes. Interestingly, levels of serum pancreatic enzymes may be normal or only minimally elevated. Insulin, heparin, plasmapheresis and fibrates effectively reduce lipid levels and relieve symptoms. A low triglyceride level is necessary to prevent relapses.
