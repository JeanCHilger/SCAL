Oxaliplatin-induced pancreatitis: a case series. Drug-induced pancreatitis is less common compared to other causes of acute pancreatitis the incidence ranges from between 0.1% to 2% of acute pancreatitis cases. Among alkylating agents, oxaliplatin has not been reported to be associated with acute pancreatitis.This case study presents a series of six cases of acute pancreatitis presumably related to exposure to oxaliplatin which had different gastrointestinal malignancies and were being treated with oxaliplatin in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs. All other related causes of acute pancreatitis were excluded before implicating oxaliplatin as a possible cause.In all cases, oxaliplatin was stopped and patients had resolution of their signs and symptoms, along with a decrease in serum amylase and lipase levels.Knowledge regarding acute pancreatitis related to oxaliplatin is of paramount importance in order to diagnose cases early and institute effective treatment in patients who are undergoing chemotherapy with this drug.
