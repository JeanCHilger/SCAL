Nutritional therapy in patients with acute pancreatitis requiring critical care unit management: a prospective observational study in Australia and New Zealand. To determine nutritional therapy practices of patients with severe acute pancreatitis (defined as those receiving critical care management in an intensive care unit or high-dependency unit) in Australia and New Zealand with focus on the choice of enteral nutrition or parenteral nutrition.Prospective observational multicentered study performed at 40 sites in Australia and New Zealand over 6 months.Intensive care units or high-dependency units within Australia and New Zealand.Those with severe acute pancreatitis diagnosed by elevated lipase and/or amylase. Patients with chronic pancreatitis were excluded.The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who received enteral nutrition, parenteral nutrition, or concurrent enteral nutrition/parenteral nutrition. Secondary outcomes included other aspects of nutritional therapy and the severity and clinical outcomes of acute pancreatitis.We enrolled 121 patients and 117 were analyzed. The mean age was 61 (sd 17) years and 53% were men. Enteral nutrition was delivered to 58 (50% 95% confidence interval [CI], 41-59%) and parenteral nutrition to 49 (42%For patients with acute pancreatitis requiring critical care unit management in Australian and New Zealand intensive care units, enteral nutrition is used most commonly, but parenteral nutrition is more often used as the initial route of nutritional therapy. Given that clinical practice guidelines currently recommend enteral nutrition as the initial route of nutritional therapy in severe acute pancreatitis, improved education about and dissemination of these guidelines seems warranted.
