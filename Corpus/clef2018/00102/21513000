Prognosis of the disease severity in patients with acute pancreatitis. Estimation of the severity state in patient, suffering an acute pancreatitis, while admitting him into a hospital, constitutes a significant part of diagnosis and complex treatment. Application of a highly accurate scales and markers, which are used to prognosticate the disease course severity and to determine the inflammation grade, may influence the results of complex treatment of the patients. In the investigation a high diagnostic accuracy in prognosis of an acute pancreatitis course severity was noted for APACHE II scale (24 hours) and Ranson scale (48 hours). There was established, that determination of a C-reactive protein content has less diagnostic accuracy, but it may be applied as a less complex and more rapid test for prognostication of an acute pancreatitis course severity after admitting the patient to hospital.
