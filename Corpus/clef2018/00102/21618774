Severity assessment and medical treatment of acute pancreatitis. Mortality rate of acute pancreatitis is 5% but can reach 47% in necrotizing pancreatitis with multiorgan failure. Prediction of an unfavourable outcome is based on bioclinical scoring systems either specific of pancreatitis or not, single biological prognostic criteria as CRP and procalciton levels measured during the first 48 h and abdominal CT-scan. Medical treatment of acute pancreatitis is symptomatic and requires intensive care in severe forms of the disease.
