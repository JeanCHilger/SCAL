Interferon regulatory factor-2 regulates exocytosis mechanisms mediated by SNAREs in pancreatic acinar cells. Pancreatic acinar cells are used to study regulated exocytosis. We investigated the role of interferon regulatory factor-2 (IRF2) in exocytosis in pancreatic acinar cells.Pancreas tissues from Irf2⁺/⁺, Irf2⁺/⁻), and Irf2⁻/⁻ mice were examined by microscopy, immunohistochemical, and immunoblot analyses amylase secretion was quantified. We also compared salivary glands and pancreatic islets of Irf2⁻/⁻ mice with those of Irf2⁺/⁻ mice. To examine the effects of increased signaling by type I interferons, we studied pancreatic acini from Irf2⁻/⁻Ifnar1⁻/⁻ mice. The effect of IRF2 on amylase secretion was studied using an acinar cell line and a retroviral system. We studied expression of IRF2 in wild-type mice with cerulein-induced pancreatitis and changes in pancreatic tissue of Irf2⁻/⁻ mice, compared with those of Irf2⁺/⁻ mice.Irf2⁻/⁻ pancreas was white and opaque numerous and wide-spread zymogen granules were observed throughout the cytoplasm, along with lack of fusion between zymogen granules and the apical membrane, lack of secretagogue-stimulated amylase secretion, and low serum levels of amylase and elastase-1, indicating altered regulation of exocytosis. The expression pattern of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors changed significantly, specifically in pancreatic acini, and was not rescued by disruption of type I interferon signaling. Down-regulation of IRF2 decreased amylase secretion in an acinar cell line. In mice with pancreatitis, levels of IRF2 were reduced. Irf2⁻/⁻ acini were partially resistant to induction of pancreatitis.IRF2 regulates exocytosis in pancreatic acinar cells defects in this process might be involved in the early phases of acute pancreatitis.
