Timing clinical events in the treatment of pancreatitis and hypertriglyceridemia with therapeutic plasmapheresis. Hyperlipidemic pancreatitis (HP) is caused by severe hypertriglyceridemia (SHTG). Evidence of SHTG refractoriness to standard medical treatment but not to therapeutic apheresis has increased in the last years.Described is the timing of clinical events and the sequence of therapeutic plasma-exchange (TPE) procedures to treat pancreatitis due to SHTG in a male patient, Caucasian, aged 49years, referred to emergency for severe epigastric pain. There was no history of alcohol consumption, a pre-existing mild hyperlipidemia was treated with diet alone, and biliary imaging was normal. Physical examination revealed epigastric tenderness. Laboratory investigation revealed marked hypertriglyceridemia (11,355mg/dL range: 30-150), and hypercholesterolemia (941mg/dLThe patient was successfully submitted to three sessions of TPE in emergency. He was released from hospital after 13 days of hospitalization. The levels of lipids and lipoproteins in his plasma were as follows: triglycerides (TG) 185mg/dL total cholesterol (TC) 179mg/dLThe decision to submit the patient with clinical evidence of HP caused by SHTG to apheresis was correct. The improvement in the clinical picture was fast and the recovery was complete.
