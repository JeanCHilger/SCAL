Mannan-binding lectin and mannan-binding lectin-associated serine protease 2 in acute pancreatitis. Complement activation may play a prominent role in acute pancreatitis (AP). Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) and MBL-associated serine protease 2 (MASP-2) participate in complement activation. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the role of MBL and MASP-2 as markers in AP with regard to etiology, inflammatory activity, severity, and development of multiorgan failure.Sixty patients with AP were included. All patients were diagnosed and treated according to a standardized regimen. Blood samples were obtained immediately on admission and again on days 1, 2, and 14.Both MBL (P < 0.001) and MASP-2 (P = 0.002) levels changed significantly over time, but without any significant relation to severity, multiorgan failure, or mortality. We found significantly higher levels of MBL (P = 0.04) in alcohol- than in gallstone-induced AP, but no significant difference in MASP-2 levels.The MBL and MASP-2 acted as acute-phase reactants, but overall, they were not markers for severity, multiorgan failure, nor for mortality in AP. Our results suggest that MBL and MASP-2 play only a minor role in the inflammatory response in AP.
