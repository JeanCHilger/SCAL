Case report of acute necrotizing pancreatitis associated with combination treatment of sitagliptin and exenatide. To report the first postmarketing case of necrotizing pancreatitis in a patient on combination therapy of sitagliptin and exenatide.We describe the patient's clinical presentation, laboratory test results, imaging, and autopsy findings.A 76-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus presented with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and fever requiring hospital admission. She had been treated with exenatide for 3 years to manage her diabetes mellitus. A few weeks before presentation, sitagliptin was added, presumably to further optimize her glycemic control. Acute pancreatitis was diagnosed during hospital admission. At initial presentation, her serum amylase concentration was 1136 U/L (reference range, 10-130 U/L) and her lipase concentration was greater than 3500 U/L (reference range, 0-75 U/L). In addition, computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated extensive previous cholecystectomy, reported no alcohol consumption, and had a normal lipid profile. Although she had a long-standing history of diabetes mellitus, she had no history of pancreatitis or other risk factors that would have caused her to develop the underlying condition. After initial brief improvement, her symptoms worsened, and despite aggressive care, her clinical state deteriorated and she died. Autopsy findings demonstrated acute necrotizing pancreatitis with complete digestion of the pancreas.Considering the temporal relationship of her symptoms to the addition of sitagliptin to her existing exenatide regimen, this case strongly suggests a possible causal link between exenatide or sitagliptin (or the combination of the 2 drugs) and the etiology of pancreatitis in this patient.
