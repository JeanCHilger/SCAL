Risk factors for post-ERCP pancreatitis in high risk patients who have undergone prophylactic pancreatic duct stenting: a multicenter retrospective study. Pancreatitis remains a serious complication after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The efficacy of prophylactic pancreatic duct stent placement to prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis in patients at high risk has been established in several randomized controlled trials. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency and risk factors of post-ERCP pancreatitis in patients who had undergone prophylactic pancreatic duct stenting.Between July 2002 and January 2010, ERCP-related procedures were performed in 9192 cases of pancreatobiliary diseases at seven institutions. Among them, 414 patients (246 men, 168 women mean age, 68 yrTherapeutic ERCP was performed in 52% of the patients. Indications for prophylactic pancreatic duct stenting were as follows: difficult cannulation of the bile duct, 192 pancreatic duct cytology/biopsy, 95Post-ERCP pancreatitis developed in 9.9% of the patients at high risk who had undergone prophylactic pancreatic duct stenting. Since the majority of cases of post-ERCP pancreatitis were mild, pancreatic duct stenting may contribute to lessening the severity of pancreatitis. The present results suggest that IPMN without a dilated pancreatic head duct is a possible risk factor for post-ERCP pancreatitis after prophylactic pancreatic duct stenting.
