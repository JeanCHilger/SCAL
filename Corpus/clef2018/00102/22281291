Recombinant human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (rhIL-1Ra) attenuates caerulein-induced chronic pancreatitis in mice. Chronic pancreatitis is a progressive inflammatory disease featuring irreversible irregular scarring of the exocrine parenchyma characterized by acinar destruction and fibrosis subsequent to inflammation in the pancreas. Despite decades of research, the knowledge is limited to the treatment of this disease. After finding a connection between interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) in caerulein-induced chronic pancreatitis, we assumed that recombinant human IL-1Ra (rhIL-1Ra), the natural antagonist of IL-1β, might have a protective role in chronic pancreatitis in mice. Chronic pancreatitis was induced by repetitive intraperitoneal injections of caerulein in C57/BL mice followed by a consecutive administration of rhIL-1Ra (10mg/kg). Collagen content and histological changes in the pancreas as well as serum amylase and lipase were measured. We found that rhIL-1Ra significantly decreased the hydroxyproline and the fibrotic area in the pancreas after the caerulein challenge. Caerulein-induced serum amylase elevation and tissue damage were also attenuated in rhIL-1Ra treated mice. Our results reveal a potential role of rhIL-1Ra in protecting mice against caerulein-induced chronic pancreatitis and lead to a conclusion that this protein may be a potential candidate agent for the treatment of chronic pancreatitis in humans.
