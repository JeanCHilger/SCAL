Evaluation of serum TWEAK concentration in patients with acute pancreatitis. Tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor super family of structurally-related cytokines. The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic and prognostic role of serum TWEAK concentration in patients with acute pancreatitis.Twenty four patients with acute pancreatitis and 24 consecutive healthy age- and sex-matched control subjects were included in the study. The serum concentrations of TWEAK were measured at admission and then at remission. The average time between admission and remission was 7-10 days.At admission, TWEAK concentration was significantly lower in patients with acute pancreatitis compared to control subjects (p < 0.001). Serum TWEAK concentrations were elevated after the remission period, however the differences were not statistically significant. In addition, serum TWEAK concentration showed a significant, inverse correlation with amylase, lipase, CRP, AST, fibrinogen, LDH and a positive correlation with calcium, albumin and platelet count.Patients with acute pancreatitis have lower serum TWEAK concentration than healthy subjects. These results suggest that serum TWEAK concentration could be a potential biomarker of acute pancreatitis.
