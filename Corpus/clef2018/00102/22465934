Pancreatic pseudocysts in children:  treatment by endoscopic cyst gastrostomy. The aim of the present study was to review the use of endoscopic cyst gastrostomy (E-CG) as a treatment option for pancreatic pseudocysts referred to a tertiary paediatric surgical centre.Retrospective review during a 10-year period (January 2001-December 2010). Cyst gastrostomies were performed using 1 or 2 double pigtailed Zimmon stents (7-10 Fr) under general anaesthesia. Data are quoted as median (range).E-CG was performed in 7 (5 males) children (median age at presentation 11.7 [8.2-15.8] years). Pancreatic pseudocysts were caused by acute pancreatitis in 5 (gallstones n = 1, hereditary pancreatitis n = 1, pancreatic divisum n = 1, asparaginase induced n = 1, and idiopathic n = 1) and pancreatic trauma in 2 (motor vehicle accident n = 1, and handlebar injury n = 1). All of the cases were associated with a rise in serum amylase level, median 1028 (276-2077) IU/L at the peak of symptoms. Three children had pancreatic duct stent placement during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography as the initial therapeutic intervention, but went on to have E-CG later. One who had a huge pseudocyst at presentation had already undergone an open cyst gastrostomy, which had recurred at 1 month. Rescue E-CG was performed 38 days later. All of the stents were removed endoscopically at 8 (6-40) weeks. E-CG was uncomplicated and pseudocysts resolved completely in 5. One required repeat placement at 15 days due to catheter slippage with later full resolution. One child required open cyst gastrostomy due to reaccumulation two months following removal of the stent. Median hospital stay post E-CG was 3 (1-23) days. There has been no recurrence at median follow-up of 18 (5-108) months.Endoscopic cyst gastrostomy is a safe and effective alternative for the management of pancreatic pseudocysts in children and should now be considered as treatment of choice.
