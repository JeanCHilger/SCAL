Advances in the enzyme diagnosis of pancreatic diseases. This paper reviews recent developments of analytical methods for the determination of alpha-amylase, of its isoenzymes, and of lipase. The evaluation of severity and etiology of acute pancreatitis by enzyme assays, e.g., pancreatic elastase 1, phospholipase A2, and routine enzymes are discussed. The limited significance of enzyme determinations as compared to imaging and endoscopic procedures for the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis is demonstrated. Indirect "tubeless" tests for the evaluation of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency with respect to the secretion of chymotrypsin (chymotrypsin in stool and NBT-PABA test) and cholesterol esterase (pancreolauryl test) are reviewed. Finally, the superiority of morphologic investigations over biochemical tests for the timely detection of pancreatic carcinoma is shown.
