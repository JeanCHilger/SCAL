Fatal and non-fatal cases of lime sulfide exposure and pathogenetic mechanisms underlying pancreatic injury: Case reports with an animal experiment. Lime sulfide poisoning by the oral route is rarely encountered in the practice of forensic science, whereas hydrogen sulfide poisoning is seen frequently. We report here two cases of fatal lime sulfide poisoning with several related cases and in addition induced histological damage with acute inflammation in animal models under at similar concentrations. We also evaluated sulfide and thiosulfate concentrations and speculated as to the cause of pancreatic damage in these cases.
