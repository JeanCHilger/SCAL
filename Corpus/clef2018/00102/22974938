Role of early systemic inflammatory response in simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation. Pancreas grafts are susceptible to surgical complications mostly related to exocrine secretions and the low microcirculatory blood flow through the gland. During simultaneous kidney-pancreas transplantation, the systemic response depends on reperfusion of two organs acute graft pancreatitis, immunotherapy, coagulopathy, bleeding, and other factors. We performed a retrospective review of 10 adult simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplant patients to evaluate progression of early postoperative inflammation in the absence of infection. All patients were treated with four-drug therapy. We performed analyses of procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein, serum creatinine, amylase, and lipase levels over the first 5 postoperative days. Relatively high peak PCT levels (maximum 130 ng/mL) were reached within 24 to 48 hours postoperatively followed by a moderate decrease. Consistent with this observation, the serum creatinine, amylase, and lipase levels decreased continuously to normal concentrations within the first week. The increased PCT levels seemed depend upon the surgical procedure and intraoperative events. PCT was superior to C-reactive protein to discriminate infection from inflammation in this setting. The dynamics of PCT levels, rather than absolute values, seemed to be important. Lack of a decrease in PCT levels after the peak, suggested an infectious complication or the development of sepsis. Monitoring and assessment of PCT levels may help in early recognition of infection and institution of therapy.
