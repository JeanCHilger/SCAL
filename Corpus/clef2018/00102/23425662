Alterations of platelet function and coagulation parameters during acute pancreatitis. Vascular thrombosis and systemic hypercoagulable states are known complications of pancreatitis. Higher levels of mean platelet volume (MPV) have been associated with thrombotic diseases. However, a few studies have investigated the association between acute pancreatitis and MPV. We aimed to investigate whether there is a difference of MPV and coagulation parameters in patients with active and remission in acute pancreatitis. We included 24 consecutive patients with biliary acute pancreatitis and 24 consecutive healthy age-matched and sex-matched controls. Full blood counts and other laboratory tests were collected at onset and remission. The MPV was significantly higher in patients with acute pancreatitis at admission 8.6±1.4 fl than controls 7.6±0.7 fl (P=0.005). We detected positive correlation between, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, γ-glutamyltransferase, amylase, lipase, and glucose, BMI, D-dimer and MPV. However, there was negative correlation between progression, thrombocyte counts, hemoglobin and MPV. As a result higher MPV levels in acute pancreatitis may reflect hypercoagulation associated with pancreatitis.
