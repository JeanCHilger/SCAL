Acute pancreatitis complicating acute hepatitis A virus infection. Acute pancreatitis complicating acute hepatitis A is very rare especially in children. We report here an 11 year old female patient with picture of acute hepatitis proved to be caused by hepatitis A. One week later patient's condition worsened, she was jaundiced, with persistent vomiting and looked acutely ill and uncomfortable with severe steady abdominal pain mainly in the epigastrium and upper quadrants. Acute pancreatitis was suspected and proved by a clinical picture associated with elevated serum amylase and serum lipase and by MRCP. The patient was managed conservatively with gradual clinical and laboratory improvement, and she was discharged after one week in a good clinical condition.
