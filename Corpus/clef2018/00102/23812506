Clinical efficacy of gabexate mesilate for acute pancreatitis in children. Children with acute pancreatitis have been treated by fasting and parenteral nutritional support, and to date, the efficacy of drugs for acute pancreatitis in children is unclear. Gabexate mesilate is a synthetic serine protease inhibitor used to prevent or treat acute pancreatitis in adult patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of gabexate for acute pancreatitis in children. Fifty-three children hospitalized with acute pancreatitis between 2004 and 2012 were divided between a gabexate-treated group (n = 26) and a control group without gabexate infusion (n = 27). The severity of acute pancreatitis was graded according to Balthazar scoring of computed tomography images. All subjects had a Balthazar score of <4 without pancreatic necrosis or organ failure. The median age of the patients was 11.8 years (range, 18 months-17 years). The durations of hospitalization, abdominal pain, and parenteral nutrition in the gabexate-treated group were significantly shorter than in control subjects (P = 0.032, P = 0.000, and P = 0.016, respectively). Serum levels of amylase and lipase were significantly lower in gabexate-infused children than in control subjects on day 7 (median amylase, 81 vs. 137 IU/L, P = 0.001 median lipase, 273 vs. 523 IU/L, P = 0.031).The present study showed that gabexate infusion has some clinical benefits for acute pancreatitis in children. The clinical application of gabexate for managing acute pancreatitis in children may be appropriate beyond conventional therapy.
