Pancreatic exocrine secretion in acute experimental pancreatitis. Little is known about exocrine pancreatic secretory function in patients with acute pancreatitis, in particular during the early phase of the disease. Therefore, this study evaluates basal and stimulated pancreatic secretion in vivo and in vitro in four different models of acute pancreatitis which reflect its clinical spectrum of severity: (a) edematous pancreatitis induced in the rat by seven IP injections of 50 micrograms/kg cerulein at hourly intervals (b) edematous pancreatitis with cellular necrosis induced in the mouse by seven IP injections of 50 micrograms/kg cerulein at hourly intervals
