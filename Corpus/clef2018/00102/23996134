Inhibition of carbohydrate and lipid digestive enzymes activities by Zygophyllum album extracts: effect on blood and pancreas inflammatory biomarkers in alloxan-induced diabetic rats. Zygophyllum album has been used as herbal medicine in Southern Tunisia to treat several diseases such as diabetes mellitus. This study is aimed to reveal the mechanisms underlying the antihyperglycemic potential, the anti-inflammatory and the protective hematological proprieties of this plant in diabetic rats. The inhibition of the α-amylase activity by different solvent-extract fractions of Z. album was tested in vitro. The fraction endowed with the powerful inhibitory activity against α-amylase was administered to surviving diabetic rats for 30 days. Data from in vitro indicated that each extract from the medicinal plant showed moderate inhibition of α-amylase enzyme except the ethyl acetate extract which was ineffective. The powerful inhibition was achieved by ethanol extract of Z. album (EZA) with an IC50 of 43.48 μg/ml as compared to acarbose (Acar) with an IC50 of 14.88 μg/ml. In vivo, the results showed that EZA decreased the α-amylase levels in serum, pancreas and intestine of diabetic rats by 40 %, 45 % and 46 %, respectively, associated with considerably reduction in blood glucose rate by 61 %. Moreover, the EZA helped to protect the structure and function of the β-cells. Interestingly, EZA had a potent anti-inflammatory effect which is manifested by decreases in CRP and TNF-α levels. Overall, a notable reduction in lipase activity both in serum and small intestine of treated diabetic rats resulted in the improvement of serum and liver lipids profile. Z. album showed a prominent antidiabetic effect via inhibition of carbohydrate and lipid digestive enzymes and ameliorated the inflammation and the disturbance of hematological biomarkers in diabetes.
