Hyperamylasaemia and dual paraneoplastic syndromes in small cell lung cancer. We hereby describe the rare case of a 59-year-old patient presenting with marked hyperamylasaemia mimicking acute pancreatitis upon admission. Investigation of co-existent hypokalemia revealed the presence of ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion, leading to the final diagnosis of small cell lung cancer, exhibiting dual paraneoplastic syndromes including Cushing Syndrome and hyperamylasaemia. Although, paraneoplastic syndromes occur commonly, paraneoplastic hyperamylasaemia especially in the context of dual paraneoplastic syndromes occurring simultaneously, is extremely rare. Such misleading manifestations require a high index of suspicion on behalf of the physician, so that an underlying malignancy is not missed, and a final diagnosis combining all clinical and laboratory findings is reached. In turn, in rare cases common biochemical markers such as amylase can be used as a useful follow up index driving further management.
