Rapid progression of a splenic aneurysm due to segmental arterial mediolysis: a rare cause of acute pancreatitis. The etiology of acute pancreatitis can be manifold, beside the usual causes. We are reporting an unusual cause that triggered acute pancreatitis.A 50 year-old male experienced attacks of acute pancreatitis (abdominal pain and elevated amylase and lipase) during sexual arousal. Serial imaging showed a rapidly-progressing, partly-thrombosed splenic artery aneurysm, with local compression of the pancreas. After angiographic coiling, the attacks subsided. Further angiography revealed additional aneurysms consistent with segmental arterial mediolysis at other sites of the body. Molecular analysis regarding Ehlers-Danlos-syndrome and genetic factors for pancreatitis, autoantibodies and Syphilis serology was negative.Acute pancreatitis was triggered by a transient rise in blood pressure during sexual stimulation, which caused rapid progression of a splenic artery aneurysm as part of systemic segmental arterial mediolysis.
