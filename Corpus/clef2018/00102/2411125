Evaluation of serum pancreatic enzymes, carbohydrate antigen 19-9, and carcinoembryonic antigen in various pancreatic diseases. Comparative studies of pancreatic enzymes carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were performed in various pancreatic disease. In acute pancreatitis as well as during acute exacerbation of chronic pancreatitis, all pancreatic enzymes were abnormally high. In chronic pancreatitis, they did not have any diagnostic sensitivity for pancreatic insufficiency. In pancreatic carcinoma, serum elastase levels may have a diagnostic value compared with other pancreatic enzymes. In studies of CEA and CA 19-9, both tumor markers were within normal range in benign pancreatitis but 27.7% of CEA and 30.7% of CA 19-9 in acute pancreatitis were above normal. In pancreatic carcinoma, although most of these patients had advanced disease, both tumor markers were extremely high and 61% for CEA and 71% for CA 19-9 were above normal. In patients with resected pancreatic carcinoma, serum CEA was slightly higher than normal CA 19-9 was much higher than normal. The sensitivity of CEA and CA 19-9 in this group were 33 and 77.7%, respectively. The results indicate that the CA 19-9 assay is a useful adjunct in the diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma, possibly in the resectable stage especially combined measurement of serum elastase and CEA.
