Hydro-proteolytic activity in rat's pancreas after irradiation. Investigations were carried out on the problem of hydrolytic ability of rat's pancreas 24 h after whole body irradiation with the single dose of 800 R and after fractionated irradiation (5 x 150 R). Besides kallikrein, enzymes of intracellular digestion (B-glucuronidase, acid phosphatase, cathepsin) and enzymes of intraluminal digestion (amylase, lipase) were chosed for examination. It was stated, that single irradiation evokes rather moderate changes in the activity of examined enzymes causing increase of catheptic and lipolytic activity and decrease in amylase activity accompanied by sharp increase of kallikrein activity in the tissue. Mechanical obstruction of biliopancreatic duct renders trend to decrease of enzymatic activity in almost all enzymes of irradiated group. After fractionated irradiation the general increase of hydroproteolytic activity (with one exception of pancreatic amylase) was stated.
