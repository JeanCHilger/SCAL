A controlled study on the use of intravenous fat in patients suffering from acute attacks of pancreatitis. Thirty-one acute attacks of pancreatitis in 27 patients were studied. 15 attacks were treated with standard therapeutic measurements alone, and 16 attacks were, in addition, treated with intravenous infusions of a commercial fat emulsion (Intralipid). Fat infusions were started on the 2nd day after admission in a dose of 1,5 g fat/kg B.W./24 h. There was a tendency of quicker alleviation of pain in the controls, but the amounts of analgesics and antispasmodics required by these patients were higher. With regard to all other variables, which are commonly used to characterize the course of acute attacks of pancreatitis, we did not observe significant differences between the controls and the patients treated with fat. We conclude that intravenous infusions of fat in the dosage used in this study does not influence the course of acute attacks of pancreatitis.
