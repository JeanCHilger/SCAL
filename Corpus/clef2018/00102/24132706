To investigate antihyperglycemic and antihyperlipidemic potential of safrole in rodents by in-vivo and in-vitro study. In the present investigation anti-diabetic and in-vitro antioxidant potential of safrole were evaluated (100 and 200 mg/kg p.o.) in acute and chronic Streptozotocin-nicotinamide (STZ) induced antihyperglycemic rat model. The oral administration of safrole for 30 days affects the level of blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), phospholipids, high density lipoprotein (HDL), body weight, insulin level, liver glycogen content, antioxidant parameters, lipase, α-amylase in normal and STZ induced diabetic rats. The oral administration of safrole at dose 100 & 200 mg/kg p.o. significantly improve the diabetic condition in Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. In enzymatic assay, the IC50 value of the safrole for α-amylase and lipase was found to be 702.78 and 861.35 μg/ml respectively which was found comparable with the standard drug (ascorbic acid) as 252.12 μg/ml. Further studies can be performed on safrole for mechanistic and toxicological aspects so that it can be investigated as a new substance for the management of various diseases.
