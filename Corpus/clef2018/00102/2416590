Effect of an analog of endogenous opioids, dalargin, on the structure and function of the exocrine tissue of the pancreas in experimental acute pancreatitis. The paper is concerned with the inhibitory effect of dalargia, a new analogue of leu-enkephalin synthesized at the Laboratory of Peptides, All-Union Cardiology Research Center, Academy of Medical Sciences of the USSR. Acute experiments on 22 dogs were performed to examine the effect of parenteral administration of dalargin in the total dose 3 mg on morphological and functional changes in the endocrine tissue of the pancreas. It was shown that intravenous injection of dalargin reduces the basal secretion and inhibits the synthesis of pancreatic enzymes in animals with the intact pancreas. In progressive hemorrhagic pancreonecrosis, intravenous drip of dalargin improves the microhemocirculation and recovers the blood supply of the pancreatic parenchyma, restricts the foci of necrosis, reduces the involvement into the pathological process of unaffected exocrine cells. Comparative analysis of changes in enzymological characteristics in the course of pancreonecrosis development before and after parenteral administration of dalargin has revealed a reduction in the proteolytic and kininogenase activity, normalization of the antitryptic activity of the pancreas.
