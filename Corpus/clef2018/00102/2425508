Acute pancreatitis as the initial manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus. A 20-year-old female with three laboratory ARA criteria pro SLE (LE cells, FANA, and positive Coombs test with hemolytic anemia), not under steroid therapy, developed polyarthritis, erythematous rash and acute pancreatitis simultaneously. The latter regressed with high doses of 6-methylprednisolone. Twenty-five months after remission of pancreatitis, no new clinical manifestations (of SLE) have appeared. In another 74 cases of SLE with an average follow-up of 3 years and 8 months there were no other cases of pancreatitis.
