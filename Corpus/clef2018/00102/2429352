31P-NMR studies of energy metabolites in rat pancreas treated with trypsin inhibitor. The energy metabolites and the composition of rat pancreas treated with trypsin inhibitor (T.I.) were investigated. T.I. treatment significantly induced the hypertrophy of pancreatic acinar cells and the increase in the amylase and sialic acid contents. However, when the pancreas was perfused by control solution or the solution containing acetylcholine (10(-7) M), the 31P-NMR spectra of energy metabolites in the pancreas treated with T.I. were similar to those of normal rats.
