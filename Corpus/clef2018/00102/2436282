Effects on peritoneal proteolysis and hemodynamics by high doses of methyl-prednisolone in experimental acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis was induced in 15 anesthetized pigs by injection of Na-taurocholate into the pancreatic duct. Seven animals were pretreated with methyl-prednisolone sodium succinate 30 mg/kg intravenously. Using chromogenic peptide substrate assays, values of trypsin (TRY), plasma prekallikrein (PKK), plasma kallikrein (KK) and functional plasma kallikrein inhibition capacity (KKI) were studied in the peritoneal exudate. Cardiac output (CO) and arterial pressure (AP) were regularly monitored before and during a six hour observation period. In acute untreated pancreatitis a 40% reduction of PKK levels was found paralleled by an increased KK activity and a reduction of KKI capacity. High TRY levels were found in several animals. The mortality rate was 63%. The pretreated animals all survived. CO and AP were significantly less reduced than in the untreated animals. Components of the plasma kallikrein-kinin system and TRY in the exudate remained mainly unchanged. Methyl-prednisolone given as pretreatment significantly improves hemodynamic parameters and increases the survival rate. Methyl-prednisolone suppresses generation of trypsin activity and activation of the plasma kallikrein-kinin system in the peritoneal exudate which may be of significant importance to the outcome.
