Effects of micron Chinese herbal Liu-He-Dan ointment on inflammation and oxidative stress in rats with acute pancreatitis. To evaluate the effects of micron Chinese herbal Liu-He-Dan ointment (MLHD) on inflammation and oxidative stress in rats with acute pancreatitis (AP).Eighteen SD rats were randomized into three groups: normal group (n = 6), AP group (n = 6) and MLHD group (n = 6). The rat model of AP was induced by intra-peritoneal injection of 150 g/L L-arginine with dosage of 2.0 mg/g twice within 2 hours. As control, the normal rats were injected the same amount of saline. The MLHD was applied to the abdomen area of the AP rats in MLHD group for 72 h. The serum and pancreas of the rats were obtained. The level of amylase, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-10 in serum and SOD, MDA in the pancreas were detected and quantified.Compared with AP group, the serum levels of amylase, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-10 were significantly decreased in MLHD group (P < 0.05). And the SOD in pancreas increased significantly (P < 0.05), but a decreasing trend of MDA level in MLHD group (P > 0.05) was observed. The serum level of the pathological score of pancreas in treatment group were similar to that in the model group (P > 0.05).Micron Liu-He-Dan ointment may have therapeutic and protective effects on AP by antioxidation and alleviating inflammatory response.
