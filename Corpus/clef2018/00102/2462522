Effects of the cholecystokinin receptor antagonist L-364,718 on experimental pancreatitis in mice. The effects of the cholecystokinin receptor antagonist L-364,718 was studied in a model of mild pancreatitis induced in mice by repeated injections of the secretagogue caerulein and in a lethal form of pancreatitis induced by feeding mice an ethionine-supplemented choline-deficient diet. L-364,718 prevented the caerulein-induced rise in serum amylase and pancreatic weight in a dose-dependent manner, the most effective dose being 0.1 mg/kg body wt. L-364,718 also prevented the caerulein-induced pancreatic inflammation as seen by light microscopy. L-364,718 offered no protective effects as determined by changes in serum amylase, pancreatic weight, histology, or mortality in the ethionine-supplemented choline-deficient diet model.
