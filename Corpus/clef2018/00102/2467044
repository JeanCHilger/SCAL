Involvement of oxygen radicals and phospholipase A2 in acute pancreatitis of the rat. The purpose of this study was to assess the involvement of oxygen radicals and phospholipase A2 in acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis was induced in rats by the CCK-analogue cerulein (5 micrograms/kg.h) for 30 min, 3.5 h, and 12 h. At the end of the infusion, serum enzymes and the lipid peroxidation products conjugated dienes and malondialdehyde in the tissue were measured. Moreover, tissue samples underwent lightmicroscopical examination. After 3.5 h cerulein, an interstitial edema and a beginning accumulation of granulocytes in the pancreatic gland is observed. These changes are aggravating within 12 h, leading to tissue necrosis and migration of the granulocytes into the tissue. Concomitantly amylase and lipase increased by 15 and 35 times, respectively. Conjugated dienes and malondialdehyde increase already after 30 min cerulein and reach their highest levels after 3.5 h cerulein. At the same time the tissue activity of phospholipase A2 is elevated three fold. Rats were treated with superoxide dismutase and catalase before cerulein infusion. Treatment significantly prevents tissue necrosis, granulocyte accumulation, and edema formation. The enhanced activity of phospholipase A2, however, is unaffected by the treatment. Oxygen radicals seem to be instrumental in the development of the disease.
