Changes of xanthine oxidase, lipid peroxide and superoxide dismutase in mouse acute pancreatitis. The role of free radicals in the development of pancreatitis was evaluated by measuring the level of activities of xanthine oxidase (XOD), lipid peroxide (LPO) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Acute pancreatitis was induced in female mice fed a choline-deficient meal containing 0.5% DL-ethionine (CDE meal). Acute pancreatitis was confirmed by the changes in serum amylase level and other typical features observed microscopically 24 h after the meal was taken. Activity of XOD was elevated significantly (p less than 0.05) from the baseline of 1.13 +/- 0.19 U/g tissue to 2.34 +/- 0.46, 2.59 +/- 0.33 and 3.46 +/- 0.70 U/g tissue, 8, 12 and 24 h, respectively, after the CDE meal. The LPO level was also increased from an undetectable amount to 1.10 +/- 0.47 nmol/ml (p less than 0.05), 1.03 +/- 0.18 (p less than 0.01) at 6 and 8 h, respectively, and then returned to an undetectable amount at 12 h. The peak level of LPO was shown at 24 h, 1.76 +/- 0.40 nmol/ml (p less than 0.01) and gradually decreased until 48 h, 1.17 +/- 0.37 nmol/ml (p less than 0.01) after the CDE meal. Changes of LPO took a biphasic pattern. SOD was decreased significantly from 47.1 +/- 3.4 mU/g tissue to 30.7 +/- 2.5, 24.8 +/- 1.7 and 20.6 +/- 1.1 mU/g tissue at 8 (p less than 0.01), 12 (p less than 0.01), and 24 (p less than 0.01) h, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
