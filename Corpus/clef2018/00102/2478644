Treatment of Wilson's disease with zinc. V. Changes in serum levels of lipase, amylase, and alkaline phosphatase in patients with Wilson's disease. We noted a frequent increase in the serum enzymes amylase, lipase, and alkaline phosphatase in patients with Wilson's disease who are receiving zinc acetate therapy (25 or 50 mg elemental zinc three times daily). Typically, values are normal before the initiation of zinc therapy, increase to slightly above normal after a few weeks of therapy, and stabilize at the high normal range after approximately a year of treatment. Very large dosages of zinc (800 mg/day) produce even further elevation of serum lipase and amylase without the symptoms of pancreatitis. Pancreatic pathologic studies of a zinc-treated rat model receiving dosages equivalent to up to 25 times the effective dosage in a human being, which is based on milligrams of zinc per kilogram of body weight, reveal that no lesions are induced by zinc treatment in the pancreas. We interpret these findings to indicate that extended maintenance therapy with zinc does not pose a risk of pancreatic damage in patients with Wilson's disease.
