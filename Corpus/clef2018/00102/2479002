Protective effect of misoprostol, a synthetic prostaglandin E1 analog, on experimental pancreatitis induced by pancreatic duct ligation in rat. This study was performed to assess the effects of misoprostol (M), a synthetic prostaglandin E1 analog, on experimental pancreatitis in rat. Pancreatitis was induced by ligation of the main pancreatic duct of 3-month-old male Wistar rats. Pancreatic lesions were observed at 6, 12, 24, 48, and 96 h after pancreatic duct ligation (PDL). A time of 48 h was chosen to evaluate M treatment. M was injected intraperitoneally (500 micrograms/kg every 4 h) between time 0 and 48 h after PDL. Stereological analysis was performed on light and electron microscopy. Total pancreatic amylase and chymotrypsin concentrations were determined. Four groups of five rats were studied: sham operated (SO), M without PDL (PG), duct ligation without M (DL), and duct ligation with M (DLPG). Edema, dedifferentiation of pancreatic acinar cells, and heterogeneous distribution of zymogen granule diameters observed after PDL were significantly decreased by M in the DLPG group. Enzyme concentrations were also decreased by M in the DLPG group. Enzyme concentrations were also decreased by M both in normal (PG) and duct ligated rats (DL). M has protective effects against pancreatic lesions induced by PDL. In this model, the protective effect of M may be due to a blockade of the autodigestive secretions of the pancreatic acinar cells.
