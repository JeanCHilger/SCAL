Behaviour of serum immunoreactive trypsin after serum activation by enterokinase in normal and cystic fibrosis patients. Evidence of a trypsin-alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor complex in some cystic fibrosis patients. Serum immunoreactive trypsin (IRT) concentrations are elevated in newborn children with cystic fibrosis (CF) and subsequently fall, in most cases, to values below normal. To evaluate the molecular form(s) of IRT present in serum, we have performed serum activation by enterokinase and have measured serum IRT before and after activation. This approach is based on the postulate that enterokinase converts trypsinogen into trypsin, and this trypsin would then be mainly trapped by alpha 2-macroglobulin, thus escaping the assay. This assumption was confirmed in the 28 controls studied, where the mean percentage (+/- S.D.) of IRT recovery after serum activation was 13.7 +/- 2.9. Previous inhibition of alpha 2-macroglobulin by methylamine raised the recovery over 85%, confirming that most of the serum IRT present in controls was in the form of trypsinogen. Identical results were obtained in the serum of 10 obligate heterozygotes and in 57 out of 80 CF patients. In 23 CF patients the mean percentage of IRT recovery after serum activation was 41.6 +/- 17.6. Gel-filtration studies were performed on the sera of the CF patients showing an abnormal increase in the IRT recovery after serum activation. We could demonstrate that IRT was distributed in two fractions: one eluted with the Mr 25,000 protein as usually found in controls and other CF sera, and the other eluted with the Mr 75,000 protein corresponding to a complex of trypsin with alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor. These results show that, in these sera, active trypsin has been directly released in blood. These findings suggest that in some patients with CF, subclinical attacks of acute pancreatitis may occur.
