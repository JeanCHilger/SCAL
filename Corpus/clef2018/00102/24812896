Efficacy of tongfu mixture for treating post-ERCP pancreatitis: a clinical study. To observe the clinical efficacy of Tongfu Mixture (TM) for post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP).Totally 54 PEP patients were randomly assigned to the control group (treated by routine therapy, 26 cases) and the TM treatment group (treated by TM, 28 cases). Clinical indices including the alleviation time of abdominal pain/distention, gastrointestinal function recovery time, and the post-surgical length of stay were observed. Blood amylase (AMY), C-reactive protein (CRP), plasma endotoxin (PLS), TNF-alpha, and IL-6 were detected before surgery, 12 h, 48 h, and 96 h after surgery.The alleviation time of abdominal pain/distention, the gastrointestinal function recovery time, and the post-surgical length of stay were obviously shorter in the TM treatment group than those in the control group (P < 0.05). The recovery of AMY and CRP were better in the TM treatment group than in the control group at post-operative 48 h and 96 h (P < 0.05). The levels of LPS, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 were lower in the TM group than in the control group at post-operative 96 h (P < 0.05).TM showed better clinical efficacy and could significantly decrease the post-surgical length of stay. post-ERCP pancreatitis integrative medicine
