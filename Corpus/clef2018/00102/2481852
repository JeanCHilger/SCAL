Effect of malabsorption syndrome on pancreatic function in broilers. The effect of "malabsorption syndrome" on pancreatic function was studied in newly hatched broiler chicks orally inoculated during the first few hours of life with intestinal homogenates from birds with naturally occurring malabsorption syndrome. The control groups were treated with saline. Tissue samples were collected at 0, 2, 4, 6, 9, 13, 17, and 29 days of age from both groups. The BW of inoculated birds decreased significantly relative to that of controls as early as 9 days of age. Pancreatic amylase activity was significantly greater than that in controls by 2 days. Protease activity of inoculated birds increased significantly over that in controls on the 2nd day and decreased significantly on the 6th and 9th days. Reoviruses were detected in the fecal samples of inoculated birds on the 2nd and 3rd days and did not appear in control samples. Reoviruses were also isolated from the pancreatic tissue of two inoculated birds on the 3rd day. Symptoms characteristic of malabsorption syndrome may be elicited by maldigestion in the present study, this probably resulted from reduced digestive enzyme production of the pancreas. Similarities of changes in plasma triiodothyronine and pancreatic protease levels suggested a possible relationship between thyroid and pancreatic dysfunction in the condition of the malabsorption syndrome.
