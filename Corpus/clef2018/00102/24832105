Role of acidic stores in secretory epithelia. There is growing evidence that intracellular calcium plays a primary role in the pathophysiology of the pancreas in addition to its crucial importance in major physiological functions. Pancreatic acinar cells have a remarkably large amount of Ca(2+) stored in both the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the acidic stores. The vast majority of the classical ER Ca(2+) store is located in the basal part of the acinar cells with extensions protruding into the apical area, however, the acidic stores are exclusively located in the secretory granular area of the cells. Both types of Ca(2+) store respond to all three intracellular Ca(2+) messengers - inositol trisphosphate (InsP3), cyclic-ADP-ribose (cADPR) and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP). The two stores interact with each other via calcium-induced calcium release however, they can be separated using pharmacological tools. The ER relies on sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) that can be blocked by the specific inhibitor thapsigargin. The acidic store requires a low pH that can be modified by blocking vacuolar H(+)-ATPase. The acidic store is particularly important for pathological processes in the pancreas. Acute pancreatitis is initiated as a result of calcium overload in the apical pole, which leads to trypsinogen activation
