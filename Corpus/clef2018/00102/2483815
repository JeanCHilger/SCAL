Decrease in the serum concentration of triiodothyronine in patients with acute edematous pancreatitis. Serum concentrations of triiodothyronine (T3), Thyroxine (T4) and Thyrotropine (TSH) were measured in ten patients hospitalized in an emergency way due to acute edematose pancreatitis clinically diagnosed and confirmed in the laboratory through the finding of values of amilase higher than 180 I.U. By means of venopunction 5 ml. of blood were taken from each patient in order to determine the thyroidal profile and amilasemia at the moment of internment and after 72 hours of the disease development. Results demonstrated a decrease of the values of T3, 72 hours after the patients entered the hospital, with normal values for T4 and TSH. This decrease reached levels of hypothyroidism with no clinical data of the disease.
