Effects of glutamine alone on the acute necrotizing pancreatitis in rats. The effects of the glutamine on the acute pancreatitis are controversial in the clinical and experimental studies. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of glutamine alone on acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP) induced by glycodeoxycholic acid in rats.Fifty-two male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 300-350 g were used. Rats were divided into four groups as sham + saline, sham + glutamine, ANP + saline and ANP + glutamine. ANP in rats was induced by glycodeoxycholic acid. The extent of acinar cell injury, mortality, systemic cardiorespiratory variables, functional capillary density, renal/hepatic functions, and changes in some enzyme markers for pancreatic and lung tissue were investigated during ANP in rats.The induction of ANP resulted in a significant increase in the mortality rate, pancreatic necrosis, and serum activity of amylase, alanine aminotransferase, interleukin-6, lactate dehydrogenase in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, serum concentration of urea, and tissue activity of myeloperoxidase and malondialdehyde in the pancreas and lung, and a significant decrease in concentrations of calcium, blood pressure, urine output, pO2, and functional capillary density. The use of glutamine alone improved these changes.Glutamine demonstrated beneficial effect on the course of ANP in rats. Therefore, it may be used by itself in the treatment of acute pancreatitis.
