Normal lipase drug-induced pancreatitis: a novel finding. Acute pancreatitis (AP) in the setting of a normal serum amylase has been previously reported in the literature. Serum lipase on the other hand has a negative predictive value approaching 100% and therefore is an excellent test to rule out AP in the emergency department. The occurrence of AP with a normal lipase is extremely rare and has never been reported in the setting of drug-induced pancreatitis. Thiazide diuretics have been implicated as a cause of pancreatic injury via a number of proposed mechanisms. However, all such cases have been in the setting of elevated serum amylase or lipase. We report the first case of radiographically proven hydrochlorothiazide-induced pancreatitis with a normal lipase.
