Timing of nasojejunal feeding tube placement and enteral nutrition in children with acute pancreatitis. To investigate the impact of timing of nasojejunal feeding tube placement and enteral nutrition on clinical outcomes in children with acute pancreatitis.A retrospective analysis was performed on the clinical data of 31 children with acute pancreatitis, who received nasojejunal feeding between January 2008 and July 2013, to investigate the relationship of abdominal symptoms/signs and serum amylase level with the tolerability of catheterization and success rate of enteral nutrition. The treatment outcome and incidence of adverse reactions and complications were compared between the early enteral nutrition group ( ≤7 days from the onset of the disease) and late enteral nutrition group (>7 days from the onset of the disease).Abdominal symptoms/signs and serum amylase level were independent of the tolerable rate of catheterization and success rate of enteral nutrition. Compared with the late enteral nutrition group, the early enteral nutrition group had a shortened time to normal serum amylase level, significantly reduced incidence of systemic complications, length of hospital stay, and hospitalization expenses, and less weight gain. The tolerable rate of catheterization and success rate of enteral nutrition showed no significant difference between the two groups. Similarly, no significant differences were found in the increase in albumin level after enteral nutrition, duration of enteral nutrition, incidence of adverse reactions, and incidence of local complications.Abdominal symptoms/signs and serum amylase level cannot be used as a measure of whether nasojejunal feeding tube placement and enteral nutrition can be performed. Early enteral nutrition can better improve clinical outcomes in children with acute pancreatitis, and it is feasible.
