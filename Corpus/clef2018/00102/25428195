Association between red blood cell distribution width and acute pancreatitis. We aimed to determine whether there are any alterations in red blood cell width in patients diagnosed with acute pancreatitis.This was a retrospective study of records of patients treated in emergency units and diagnosed with acute pancreatitis between January 2011 and April 2013. Records were investigated regarding patient age, sex, and causes of acute pancreatitis. Red blood cell width and amylase values obtained from the patients during diagnosis and after a full recovery from acute pancreatitis were added to the records.Recorded red blood cell width and amylase values of 104 patients diagnosed with acute pancreatitis were statistically compared according to the time of sample collection. Samples were collected in the post-diagnostic period and after full recovery. Values of red blood cell width and amylase were found to be significantly higher in samples collected during hospital admission in comparison to those obtained from patients after fully recovering from acute pancreatitis (p<0.05).An increase in red blood cell width value is a marker of acute pancreatitis therefore, we suggest that red blood cell width can be used as a tool for the early diagnosis and assessment of disease progression.
