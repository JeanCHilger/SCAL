Intraductal infusion of taurocholate followed by distal common bile duct ligation leads to a severe necrotic model of pancreatitis in mice. The most common etiology of acute pancreatitis results from the impaction of gallstones or sludge in the distal common bile duct (CBD). The result is pancreatic duct obstruction, diversion of bile into the pancreas, or cholestasis. In the current study, we examined whether combining both aspects, that is, infusion of the bile acid taurocholate (TC) followed by bile duct ligation (BDL), could yield a more severe form of pancreatitis that mimics biliary pancreatitis.In mice, after laparotomy, the CBD was infused with either normal saline (NS) or TC. Subsequently, the CBD was ligated at the ampulla.Mice receiving TC infusion followed by BDL (TC + BDL) had higher mortality compared with animals receiving intraductal NS with BDL (NS + BDL). The TC + BDL arm developed more severe and diffuse pancreatic necrosis. In addition, serum amylase, IL-6, and bilirubin were significantly higher. However, pancreatic edema as well as lung and liver injury were unchanged between TC + BDL and NS + BDL.In summary, the combination of bile infusion into the pancreas followed by BDL causes a more severe, necrotizing pancreatitis. We believe that this novel model of pancreatitis is useful because it can be used in transgenic mice and recapitulates several aspects of biliary pancreatitis.
