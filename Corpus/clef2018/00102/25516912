A sensitive one-step method for quantitative detection of α-amylase in serum and urine using a personal glucose meter. Assays of α-amylase (AMS) activity in serum and urine constitute the important indicator for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, mumps, renal disease and abdominal disorders. Since these diseases confer a heavy financial burden on the health care system, AMS detection in point-of-care is fundamental. Here, a one-step assay for direct determination of the AMS activity was developed using a portable personal glucose meter (PGM). In this assay, maltopentaose was used as a substrate for sensitive detection of AMS with the assistance of α-glucosidase. In the presence of AMS, maltopentaose can be readily hydrolyzed to form maltotriose and maltose quickly. With the enzymatic hydrolysis of α-glucosidase, maltotriose and maltose can be turned into glucose rapidly, which can be quantitatively measured using a portable PGM. This assay did not require any cumbersome and time consuming operations, such as surface modification, synthesis of invertase conjugate, washing and centrifugation. Detection of AMS can be achieved using only a one-step mixture, and the limit of detection was 20 U L(-1) which was lower than the clinical cutoff for AMS. More importantly, this sensitive and selective assay was also used for the detection of AMS in human serum/urine samples. The results showed that the recovery of AMS from human serum/urine samples was 91-107%. The rapid and easy-to-operate assay may have potential application in the fields of point-of-care (POC) clinical diagnosis, particularly in rural and remote areas where lab equipment may be limited.
