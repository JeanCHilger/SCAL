Prediction of the acute pancreatitis after surgery on the pancreas. Study preoperative and intraoperative risk factors for acute postoperative pancreatitis after surgical treatment of the pancreatic diseases.Predictive value of the probable preoperative and intraoperative risk factors of the acute postoperative pancreatitis after surgical treatment of the proximal and distal pancreatic cancer were explored and evaluated. Patients were divided at the high risk group and mild risk group using a specially developed formula.Preoperative and intraoperative risk factors of the acute postoperative pancreatitis were detected and had predictive value. Much of the identified preoperative risk factors indirectly or objectively showed morphology and function of the pancreas. The importance at the development of the acute postoperative pancreatitis playing the conditions of sur gical intervention, its volume and features of technology, results of the intraoperative research of the pathological focus and status of the pancreatic tissue. Its risk factors have been ranked to intraoperative risk factors. The Identification of the intraoperative risk factors of the acute postoperative pancreatitis allowed to make correction of the risk of complications determined at the preoperative stage.The data on the effect of various technological solutions and surgical tactics to the possibility of the development of the acute postoperative pancreatitis should be considered in predicting the development of complications and in develop the most effective and safe technologies of the surgical treatment of the pancreatic diseases, as well as in optimization of the prevention of the acute postoperative pancreatitis and postoperative complications.
