Splenic vein thrombosis in patients with acute pancreatitis. We performed a retrospective autopsy case-control study to identify clinical characteristics of acute pancreatitis associated with splenic vein thrombosis. Age, sex, spleen weight, presence or absence of gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and pancreatic pseudocyst were not associated with splenic vein thrombosis. Patients with peak serum amylase over 10,000 U/L were at high risk for splenic vein thrombosis. We conclude that, of the factors examined, only the peak serum amylase may be of value in diagnosing splenic vein thrombosis in patients with acute pancreatitis.
