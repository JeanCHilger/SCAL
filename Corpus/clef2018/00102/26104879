Familial hypertriglyceridemia: biochemical, clinical and molecular study in a Moroccan family. Familial hypertriglyceridemia is a rare autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism. Mutation within the LPL gene constitutes the first cause of monogenic etiology. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is the key enzyme in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins catabolism. Familial LPL deficiency is expressed by eruptive xanthomatosis and acute pancreatitis. We report a Moroccan case with a monstrous hypertriglyceridemia caused by LPL gene mutation. We discuss pathophysiology aspects according to available investigations data and the relevance of familial screening. The proband is a 19-year-old woman originating from the village of Taourirt (South of Morocco). She was admitted in emergency for diabetic ketoacidosis. Clinical investigations and routine laboratory tests were performed upon admission. Then lipoprotein electrophoresis and sequencing of the LPL gene were practiced. A monstrous hypertriglyceridemia up to 199 mmol/L was found. Lipoprotein electrophoresis has objectified profound disturbances on chylomicrons, VLDL and IDL. The sequencing detected a missense mutation p.S286R at homozygous state in a consanguinity context. Discovery of this LPL gene mutation is the first indigenous and documented case, never related in any other ethnic group. It constitutes a novel proof of a founder effect in the south Moroccan population. Prevalence studies with familial screening should be done for preventative action which is the only acceptable way to limit the cardiovascular and pancreatitis risks in this population where inbreeding is a general rule.
