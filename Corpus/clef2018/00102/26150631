A multidisciplinary approach to an unusual cause of hyperamylasaemia. Clinical features together with elevation of pancreatic enzymes are the key diagnostic indicators of acute pancreatitis. We report a case of a woman in her 50s who presented with abdominal distension and serum amylase raised to more than 30 times the upper limit of normal. She was initially treated for acute pancreatitis, however, she was not symptomatic of this and the pancreas appeared to be normal on CT scan. Further investigations revealed the patient had a high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma with nodal metastatic spread. An amylase-secreting ovarian tumour was suspected, which was supported by elevated salivary-amylase isoenzymes, consistent with previous reports in the literature. The patient was treated with chemotherapy and surgery, during which her serum amylase and CA-125 initially fell significantly, but eventually both increased, reflecting disease progression. This case serves as an important reminder to consider non-pancreatic causes of raised serum amylase, to avoid misdiagnosis.
