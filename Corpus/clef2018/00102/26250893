High Expression Levels of Trigger Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells-1 on Neutrophils Associated with Increased Severity of Acute Pancreatitis in Mice. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM)-1 expression on neutrophils is associated with inflammation and infection. However, the dynamic changes of the TREM-1 expression on neutrophils have not been clarified in inflammatory acute pancreatitis (AP). The aim of this study was to longitudinally investigate the TREM-1 expression on peripheral blood and peritoneal neutrophils and its relationship with the levels of plasma cytokines and disease severity in a mouse model of AP following injection with varying doses of L-arginine to induce mild AP (MAP) or severe AP (SAP). The results indicated that induction of MAP or SAP was associated with moderate and severe pancreatic tissue damage and varying levels of serum and peritoneal fluid amylase as well as survival rates in mice. In comparison with that in the healthy controls, significantly increased percentages of peripheral blood and peritoneal fluid CD14-TREM-1(+) neutrophils and higher levels of TREM-1 mRNA transcripts in peripheral blood nuclear cells were detected in the MAP and SAP mice, particularly in the SAP mice. Higher levels of plasma tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), but lower levels of plasma interleukin (IL)-10, were detected in the MAP and SAP mice at varying time points post induction. The percentages of peripheral blood CD14-TREM-1(+) neutrophils were correlated positively with the levels of TNF-α, GM-CSF, and amylase as well as the pathogenic scores, but negatively with the levels of IL-10 in the AP mice. Therefore, TREM-1(+) neutrophils may participate in the pathogenesis of AP and serve as a biomarker for evaluating the severity of AP.
