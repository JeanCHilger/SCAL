EUS and EUS-FNA diagnosis of suspected pancreatic cystic neoplasms: Is the sum of the parts greater than the CEA? Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is suggested as the single most useful EUS/EUS-FNA derived test for the diagnosis of mucinous pancreatic cysts.To investigate the yield and diagnostic performance of EUS/EUS-FNA on an intention to diagnose basis and to determine the utility of the recommended CEA and amylase cut-off values.A retrospective study of a prospectively maintained database of 433 procedures performed in a 10 year period. Diagnostic performance of EUS-FNA was determined in 133 procedures with a definite diagnosis.CEA value was determined in significantly fewer procedures (58.6%) than EUS diagnosis was stated (83.4% p < 0.0001), cyst fluid appearance recorded (89.4%) or adequate sample for cytology obtained (76.7%The combination of EUS, cytology and CEA performed well. Malignant cysts had a higher CEA value than benign cysts. On an intention to diagnose basis a CEA cut-off of 110 ng/ml performed poorly.
