Comparison of Predictive Systems in Severe Acute Pancreatitis According to the Revised Atlanta Classification. We aimed to compare the prognostic value of various predictors and complex scoring systems for prediction of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) according to the revised Atlanta classification.C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin were obtained on admission, and CRP level 24 hours after admission (CRP2) was measured. Various scoring systems including Ranson, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Examination (APACHE II), the Bedside Index for Severity in Acute Pancreatitis, and Computed Tomography Severity Index (CTSI) were calculated.There were 146 patients with acute pancreatitis (mean age, 50.6 Â± 18.3 years 63% male), of which 43 patients (29.5%) received a diagnosis of moderately severe AP, and 17 patients (11.6%) received a diagnosis of SAP. In patients with moderately severe acute pancreatitis to SAP, CTSI (odds ratio [OR], 10.46Procalcitonin was the best predictor for patients with SAP CTSI, APACHE II, and CRP2 were valuable predictors for patients with moderately severe acute pancreatitis and SAP.
