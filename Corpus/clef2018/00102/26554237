D-dimer, a Potential Marker for the Prediction of Severity of Acute Pancreatitis. A number of experimental studies have been put forth suggesting an important role of the hemostatic system in acute pancreatitis (AP) in the recent past. However, meaningful studies on clinical values of parameters of the hemostatic system in predicting pancreatitis associated complications are still scarce. In the current investigation, we evaluated the role of D-dimer to predict the severity of acute pancreatitis on day 1 of admission to the hospital.A total of 160 subjects (75 mild AP + 35 severe AP + 50 healthy controls) were examined in the study. Biochemical and hemostatic parameters were compared between various groups of subjects on day 1 and day 3 of admission to the hospital.Levels of prothrombin time (PT), fibrinogen, D-dimer, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly higher in the severe AP group than in the mild AP group. Antithrombin III (AT III) levels were significantly lower in the severe AP group than in the mild AP group. D-dimer levels were 5 times higher than the reference limit in the severe group and 1.7 times higher than the reference limit in the mild group. This difference was statistically highly significant (< 0.0001). A positive correlation between D-dimer and CRP, D-dimer and fibrinogen, and between D-dimer and PT was recorded.Estimation of the levels of D-dimer on admission day provides an accurate method for the identification of patients who will develop systemic complications in the further course of AP.
