An unreported case of pancreatic panniculitis in a liver transplant patient. Pancreatic panniculitis is an uncommon condition that can occur in association with pancreatic disease. Most of the cases reported to date were associated with acute or chronic pancreatitis and pancreas cancer. Recently, development has been described in kidney transplant patients and secondarily to allograft pancreatitis in a pancreas-kidney transplant recipient. Both findings suggest that immunological processes may be involved in the pathogenesis of this entity. We report for the first time a case of acute pancreatitis associated with pancreatic panniculitis in a patient who underwent a liver transplant 10 months before. A 69-year-old man with a history of epigastric pain of a few days of evolution was presented with painful subcutaneous nodules on both legs. Blood chemistry showed raised serum amylase and lipase levels. Ultrasonography and multislice CT scan were suggestive of an acute pancreatitis. A skin biopsy showed typical features of pancreatic panniculitis which included lobular panniculitis with lipocyte degeneration with ghost cells. The administration of octreotide resulted in both a rapid improvement of symptoms and a disappearance of skin lesions. Liver transplant specialists should be aware that the pancreatic panniculitis could be a manifestation ofpancreas disease in patients who have undergone l ver transplantation.
