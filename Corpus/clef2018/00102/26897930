One-Step LC and ERCP Treatment of 40 Cases with Cholelithiasis Complicated with Common Bile Duct Stones. To discuss the clinical significance of combined application of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for one-stage treatment of cholelithiasis complicated with common bile duct stones.To retrospectively analyze 40 cases with cholelithiasis complicated with common bile duct stones treated with LC plus intraoperative ERCP between May 2005 and September 2012 and to evaluate the clinical efficacy in the treatment of cholelithiasis complicated with common bile duct stones.Among 40 cases, 36 successfully underwent LC plus intraoperative ERCP and 4 were transferred to open surgery. Eighteen patients with preoperative abnormal liver function showed declined indexes post-operatively. Compared with LC, more patients had abdominal distention and vomiting. Seven patients presented with transient increase in the levels of serum amylase with no incidence of acute pancreatitis. One had hematochezia and recovered after conservative treatment with no incidence of bile leakage and perforation and other severe complications.LC combined with intraoperative ERCP is safe and efficacious in the primary treatment of cholelithiasis complicated with common bile duct stones to avoid open surgery and double surgeries.
