Clinical and radiologic characteristics of pancreatic head carcinoma without main pancreatic duct dilatation: using dual-phase contrast-enhanced CT scan. The purpose was to evaluate characteristics of pancreatic cancer without main pancreatic duct (MPD) dilatation on dual-phase computed tomographic (CT) scans.We studied 16 patients with pancreatic head cancer without accompanying MPD dilatation and 39 patients with MPD dilatationElevation of serum amylase level and peripancreatic fluid collection were more frequently seen in the MPD(-). Common bile duct dilatation and atrophy of the upstream pancreatic parenchyma were more frequently seen in MPD(+).Pancreatic cancers without MPD dilatation were more frequently related to acute pancreatitis and had fewer secondary signs. Thus, early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer with these characteristics could be difficult.
