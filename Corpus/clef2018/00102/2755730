Role of xanthine oxidase in the genesis of acute pancreatitis. Experiments were conducted on 268 male albino rats with modeled acute pancreatitis to study the xanthine oxidase (XO) activity in the pancreatic tissue during intraperitoneal administration of stimulators of pancreatic exocrine function (pilocarpine) and inhibitors of enzyme activity (allopurinol). Pilocarpine (0.1 mg/kg) increased XO activity by 90-100% one-three hours after injection, which was due to increased synthesis of the enzyme. Allopurinol (500 mg/kg) inhibiting XO activity removes the XO activating effect of pilocarpine in the first two hours after injection. It was established that one of the tranquilizers of the 1,4-benzodiazepine series--seduxen (15 mg/kg) produces an inhibiting effect on XO activity and, like allopurinol, removes the XO activating effect of pilocarpine. Complete parallelism was also revealed between the dynamics of changes of XO activity in the pancreatic tissue and alpha-amylase in blood under the effect of the preparations studied.
