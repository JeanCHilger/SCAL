Elevated plasma pancreatic enzyme concentrations after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass may indicate closed loop obstruction. Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is one of the most commonly performed bariatric procedures and most patients are women of reproductive age. Consequently, general surgeons and obstetricians need to be aware that these patients are at risk of bariatric specific surgical complications during their pregnancy. We report a case involving a 32-year-old woman who had undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery 2 years previously. She presented at 25 weeks of gestation with a closed loop obstruction due to a retrograde jejunojejunal intussusception that was initially misdiagnosed as acute pancreatitis.
