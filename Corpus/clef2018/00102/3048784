Multicenter evaluation of a specific pancreatic isoamylase assay based on a double monoclonal-antibody technique. Eleven evaluators from nine laboratories in five countries evaluated a new immunoinhibition method for pancreatic isoamylase determination that is as simple to perform as that for total amylase. The precision at low and intermediate activity concentrations was superior, and at high concentrations it equalled that of the wheat-germ inhibitor method. The test was linear to approximately 2000 U/L, depending on the instrumentation used. The percentage salivary isoamylase activities remaining in specimens after reaction with two monoclonal antibodies ranged from 2 to 4.4%. Comparative studies showed good correlation with the wheat-germ inhibitor (r greater than 0.978) and electrophoresis methods (r = 0.920). Hemolysis, lipemia, and bilirubinemia have no effect on results. Interlaboratory studies demonstrated excellent transferability of the method, if instruments are calibrated with the same calibrator. Reference intervals for pancreatic isoamylase are 13 to 64 U/L (25 degrees C), 13 to 83 U/L (30 degrees C), and 17 to 115 U/L (37 degrees C). A clinical evaluation of patients with acute pancreatitis showed that pancreatic isoamylase has a greater clinical sensitivity than total amylase.
