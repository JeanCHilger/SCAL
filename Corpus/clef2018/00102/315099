Alpha-amylase determination in acute pancreatitis: selection of a reference standard. It has been investigated which of the amylase determinations agrees most closely with the clinical diagnosis in a group of patients with acute pancreatitis and in a group with other diseases producing amylase elevation. By measuring the amylase in a urine specimen related to its creatinine concentration fewer values within the range of reference in patients with pancreatitis and also fewer falsely elevated values in the second group were observed when compared to amylase in plasma, urinary amylase activity per volume or the amylase/creatinine clearance ratio.
