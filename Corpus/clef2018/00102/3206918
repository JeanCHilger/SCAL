Influence of experimental hyperthyroidism on the adult rat pancreas, small intestine, and blood gastrin levels. Thyroxine modulates the ontogenic changes of animal tissues. In this study, the effects of experimental hyperthyroidism on the adult rat pancreas, small intestine, and serum gastrin were evaluated. Hyperthyroidism was induced by oral feeding of thyroxine (T4) in increasing dosages (150-450 micrograms/kg body weight 3 weeks) and controlled by measurements of the circulating hormones. The increase of thyroid hormones in blood (T4 ng/dl: thyroxine-treated rats 10.8 vs. controls 3.3
