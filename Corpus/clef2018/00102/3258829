Effect of hydroxymethyluracil on the course of experimental pancreatitis in the rat. Experiments were carried out on 150 male rats weighing 200-250 g and 42 white mice weighing 18-20 g by using two models of acute pancreatitis, two models of inflammation and studying osmotic resistance of erythrocytes. In experimental pancreatitis hydroxymethyluracil (50 mg/kg) decreased the blood lipase activity. The therapeutic effect of the agent is related to its anti-inflammatory and membrane-protecting properties.
