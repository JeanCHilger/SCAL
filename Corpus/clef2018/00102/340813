Laboratory aids in the diagnosis of pancreatitis. The diagnosis of both acute and chronic pancreatitis continues to be a challenge despite the development of new techniques and the refinement of old methods. The problem is best approached by the application of a combination of tests which can provide a reasonable degree of sensitivity and specificity applicable to the different forms of pancreatitis. In acute pancreatitis an elevation of serum amylase and amylase/creatinine clearance ratio is diagnostically useful. In chronic pancreatitis, several tests are needed to enhance the diagnostic yield, and such tests can include the secretin-pancreozymin test, ERCP, fecal fat measurement, Lundh test meal, and the administration of the synthetic peptide BZ-Ty-PABA.
