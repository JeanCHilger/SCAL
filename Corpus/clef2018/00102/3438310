Whipple's procedure plus intraoperative pancreatic duct occlusion for severe chronic pancreatitis: clinical, exocrine, and endocrine consequences during a 3-year follow-up. The present investigation provides follow-up data (up to 36 months) of exocrine and endocrine pancreatic function, inflammatory activity, pain, and body weight in 23 chronic pancreatitis patients submitted to Whipple's procedure plus intraoperative Ethibloc occlusion of the remaining pancreatic duct system between January 1983 and February 1984. Clinically, Whipple's procedure plus intraoperative pancreatic duct occlusion resulted in almost complete and continuous cessation of pain as well as significant (p less than 0.05) increase in body weight. With regard to exocrine pancreatic function (Secretin-Pancreozymin test, plasma amino acid consumption test, Pankreolauryl test, fecal chymotrypsin determination), intraoperative pancreatic duct occlusion was shown to induce high-grade insufficiency and thus exocrine parenchymal atrophy in all patients. Simultaneously, the inflammatory process (represented by serum levels of trypsin, lipase, and pancreatic isoamylase) was terminated in all 23 patients. Endocrine pancreatic function, evaluated by serum levels of insulin and C-peptide measured under fasting conditions and subsequent maximal combined beta-cell stimulation as well as corresponding integrated hormone releases, was reduced by partial pancreas resection by about 50%, while there was no further impairment during the 36-month follow-up period in consequence of additional intraoperative pancreatic duct occlusion. Altogether, Whipple's procedure plus intraoperative Ethibloc occlusion of the residual pancreatic duct system seems suitable for termination of the inflammatory process and thus preservation of residual endocrine pancreatic function in chronic pancreatitis.
