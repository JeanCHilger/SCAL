Common channel for bile and pancreatic ducts. Presentation of 12 cases and discussion. Between 1978 and 1985, 11 girls and one boy underwent an elective operation for a congenital choledochal dilatation associated with an anomalous biliopancreatic junction. In 10 out of these 12 cases the children suffered several episodes of abdominal pain, and the diagnosis was missed since a jaundice appeared. The ultrasonographic examination demonstrated in all cases a dilatation of both extra- and intrahepatic bile ducts. The preoperative diagnosis was always established by the mean of a transhepatic cholangiography (8 cases) or a percutaneous cholecystography (4 cases), which showed in every case a dilated choledochus, and a common biliopancreatic channel, 15 to 35 mm long. A high amylase level was found in the bile in 10/10 cases when it was measured. A cholecystokinin test was performed in 4 cases, resulting in each case in a considerable increase of amylase and lipase levels in bile. All children were treated by excision of the dilated choledochus and gallbladder, followed by an hepaticojejunostomy with a Roux en Y loop. The follow-up is 6 months to 5 years for 9 children: 8 are cured, and on girl, who had a major dilatation of the left intrahepatic bile ducts, suffered from episodic abdominal pain and an episode od cholangitis 6 years after the operation. The role of such a common channel in the pathogeny of congenital choledochal cysts, acute pancreatitis in children, and biliary carcinomas in young adults is discussed according to the literatures of the last 10 years.
