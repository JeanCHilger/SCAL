Hemosorption in the treatment of endogenous toxemia in acute pancreatitis. One of important components of endogenous intoxication in acute pancreatitis is considered to be middle-mass molecules possessing high toxicity. Hemosorption improves results of complex therapy and reduces postoperative lethality by 10% at an average. The positive effect of hemosorption in focal pancreanecrosis is associated with sorption of lipase, trypsin, middle-mass molecules and other metabolites. In total pancreanecroses the effect of hemosorption was minimal. In hemosorption on the sorbent SKN the oxygenation and regional heparinization of the sorbent is indicated.
