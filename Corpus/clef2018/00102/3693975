Ceruletide-induced acute pancreatitis in the dog and its amelioration by exogenous secretin. Large pharmacological doses of ceruletide administered to conscious dogs by intravenous (i.v.) infusion uniformly induce a severe acute necrotizing pancreatitis within 4 h. High-dose i.v. secretin administered for a period of 24 h after cessation of ceruletide infusion resulted in a significant amelioration of the acute pancreatitis compared to non-secretin-treated dogs with acute pancreatitis. Light microscopy of the pancreas in secretin-treated dogs revealed a significant decrease in edema, polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration, cell necrosis and acinar cell vacuolization. Serum amylase levels in secretin-treated dogs were significantly decreased compared to non-secretin-treated dogs. The results of this study suggest that high-dose i.v. secretin exerts a beneficial effect on pre-established, ceruletide-induced acute pancreatitis in dogs.
