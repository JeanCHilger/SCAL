Effect of intravenous and intraduodenal administration of Escherichia coli endotoxin on the porcine pancreas as evaluated by changes in the serum cationic trypsin-like immunoreactivity. In six pigs intravenous administration of Escherichia coli endotoxin caused septic shock and a significant increase in serum cationic trypsin-like immunoreactivity (CTLI), with activation of cationic trypsinogen to trypsin and formation of complexes between cationic trypsin, on the one hand, and alpha 2-macroglobulin and alpha 1-antitrypsin, on the other, compatible with acute pancreatitis. In contrast, intraduodenal infusion of E. coli endotoxin to seven other pigs was without effect on the general circulation and on the serum CTLI.
