Juxtapancreatic intestinal duplications with pancreatic ductal communication: a cause of pancreatitis and recurrent abdominal pain in childhood. Pancreatic duplications with ductal communications should be included in the differential diagnosis of any child presenting with recurrent abdominal pain of unknown etiology and should be considered as a possible cause of pancreatitis in childhood. Such duplications most likely arise from nonregressing diverticula of the pancreatic bud during embryologic development. Their clinical presentation is unique from other duplications because of their anatomic association with the pancreatic duct. Pain and weight loss are the major presenting complaints, although many patients have nausea and vomiting. Serum chemistries, in particular the serum amylase, are usually normal and are of little help in the differential diagnosis. Radiographic evaluation has not been particularly helpful in the past. ERCP, ultrasonic examination, and CT scan show great promise, however. Operative intervention should be tailored for the individual patient. The operation performed will depend upon operative findings. Intraoperative pancreatograms or cystograms are very helpful in differentiating these cysts from others at the time of operation. Pathologically, most of the duplications have a thickened muscular coat that usually has some evidence of inflammation. They are usually lined with gastric mucosa. Except in the most severe cases, the pancreas is histologically normal, suggesting that most of the pain experienced by these patients is secondary to inflammation within the duplication. The inflammatory response may completely destroy the mucosal lining and cause fibrosis within the muscular coat of the duplication. In those instances, these lesions cannot be differentiated from pancreatic pseudocyst. This may account for some of the "idiopathic" pseudocysts reported in the literature.
