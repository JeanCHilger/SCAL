Changes of pancreatic exocrine function after major resection of the pancreas in dogs. Changes of an exocrine function after major resection of the canine pancreas were observed by pancreozymin-secretin test and the results were compared with an endocrine function examined by glucose tolerance test. The exocrine function of the remnant pancreas revealed characteristic changes according to the resection rate of the pancreas: 1) After removal of 50 to 70 per cent of the entire pancreas, diabetes did not develop and the exocrine function of the remnant pancreas was well maintained. 2) After 70 to 90 per cent pancreatectomy, diabetes developed six weeks or more later and the exocrine function of the remnant pancreas per body weight decreased slightly. The degree of disturbance of the exocrine function in the diabetic dogs was greater than that in the non-diabetic group, but the exocrine function per the remnant pancreas weight increased and it was greater than normal level even in the diabetic dogs. The hypersecretory state of the exocrine pancreas after surgery was verified. 3) After 90 per cent or greater resection of the pancreas, diabetes occurred immediately and disturbance of the exocrine function was remarkable. Hypersecretory state did not appear. 4) Both the endocrine and exocrine functions after major pancreatic resection were found to be related to the resection rate, but there were significant differences in the reserve capacity of the endocrine and exocrine pancreas.
