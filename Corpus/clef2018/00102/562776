Change in the functional state and tissue oxidative processes of the pancreas under the influence of alcoholic intoxication. Experiments conducted with albino rats demonstrated that intragastrically introduced ethyl alcohol in a dose of 3 g/kg intensifies the external-secretary function of the pancreas and also increases the activity of the pancreatic juice amylase in the blood, this activity continuing to be elevated 24 hours after a single introduction of the alcohol. The action of the latter reduces the oxygen tension and the redox potential in the glandular tissue, lessens the activity of NAD-dependent dehydrogenases occurring against the background of the succinate-cytochrome-c-oxydoreductase complex activity, which bears evidence to the development of "hypoxy-like" shifts in the metabolic stade of the pancreas. The author concludes that the toxic action of alcohol on the pancreas is associated with disturbances in the redox processes and with the damage of cellular membranes.
