Experimental acute pancreatitis. Inducement by taurocholate sodium-trypsin injection into a temporarily closed duodenal loop in the rat. Experimental pancreatitis induced by permanently closed duodenal loop results in death of the experimental animal. Acute pancreatitis can be induced in the rat by injection of taurocholate sodium-trypsin solution intraluminally into a temporarily occluded duodenal loop. Mortality in this model was 45% within one week after injection. Mean serum amylase level was greatly increased above that in control rats that underwent temporary duodenal ligation without intraduodenal injection of fluid. The presence of pancreatitis was confirmed by histological examination. The advantage of the temporarily occluded pancreatitis model is that the animal can survive if the stimulus is not excessively severe.
