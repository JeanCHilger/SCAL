Experimental pancreatitis: influence of secretory state of the pancreas. The influence of the secretory state of the pancreas on the development of pancreatitis in an isolated, ex vivo, perfused canine pancreas model was evaluated. Free fatty acid infusion was used to induce pancreatitis, and secretin, glucagon, and atropine were administered to influence the secretory state. Despite a 40-fold difference in hourly secretory output, the development of pancreatitis as judged by weight gain, hemoconcentration, amylase value, and arterial blood pressure response was similar in the stimulated, basal, and suppressed states. This study casts further doubt on the role of hypersecretion in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis.
