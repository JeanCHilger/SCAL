The role of the complement system in experimental pancreatitis (author's translation). Two different experimental procedures were used to induce pancreatitis in rats: distal ligature of the common bile duct and the Pfeffer method in modification of Nevalainen. It could be shown that consumption of complement can be demonstrated even in pancreatitis induced by other than immunological models. Further examination in decomplemented rats showed the possibility of inducing acute pancreatitis by the above-mentioned models, although of less intensity. Therefore, the complement system will be an important factor for the progress and intensity of the inflammation process.
