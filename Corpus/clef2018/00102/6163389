The effect of zinc-protamine-glucagon in acute pancreatitis. A double blind study testing the effect of long-acting zinc-protamine-glucagon (7.5 mg every 12 hours for 4--5 days) was carried out in acute pancreatitis. There were 32 patients in ZP-glucagon- and 39 patients in the placebo group. The results show that glucagon had a slightly favourable effect on the general clinical course of the disease but they do not give enough evidence for routine use of glucagon in pancreatitis.
