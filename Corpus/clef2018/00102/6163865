Traumatic disruption of the pancreatic duct demonstrated by endoscopic retrograde pancreatography. Recurrent episodes of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting associated with hyperamylasemia were noted in a 27-year-old female following blunt trauama in a bicycle accident. Ultrasound study of the upper abdomen and an upper gastrointestinal series were normal. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) demonstrated a disruption of the main pancreatic duct and was very useful in planning and performing a distal pancreatectomy 17 days postinjury. The patient continues to be well 3 years later.
