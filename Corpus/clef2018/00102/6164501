Postoperative hyperamylasemia in surgery of the biliary tract (clinical contribution). The Authors refer on the presence of hyperamylasemia in 46 patients subjected to surgery of the bile ducts. A rise in serum amylase values was found in 22,42 of the cases. In one case only, hyperamylasemia was accompanied by a clinical picture of acute pancreatitis. In the rest of the patients the increase of the amylasemid has not modified the postoperative course and its completely normalization. The negativity of the clinical picture appears to indicate that the hyperamylasemia is to be considered as an aspecific and only partly pancreatic response to a injuries over very delicate anatomical structures.
