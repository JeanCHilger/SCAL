Effective aprotinin therapy in canine experimental bile-trypsin pancreatitis. Acute haemorrhagic pancreatitis was induced by intraductal injection of a bile-trypsin blood mixture in 22 dogs, with a 100% mortality in 4 dogs given supportive therapy alone. Control animals survived without ill effect. The remaining 18 dogs were given supplementary intravenous aprotinin (400,000 KI units) at varying times after onset of acute pancreatitis. 10 given this treatment starting 1--6 h after induction of pancreatitis survived without appreciable morbidity. A 9- and 12-hour delay in starting aprotinin therapy was associated with a 25 and 75% mortality rate, respectively. Monitoring of serum (and urinary) amylase, serum calcium and albumin is documented.
