Pancreatic acinar cell function and morphology in rats chronically fed an ethanol diet. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of prolonged ethanol intake on the morphology and protein metabolism in the rat pancreatic acinar cells. Weight-matched triplets of Sprague-Dawley rats were fed Lieber-DeCarli diet containing 5% (wt/vol) concentration of ethanol, isocaloric amounts of Lieber-DeCarli diet, or rat chow ad libitum for 6, 12, and 18 mo. In the ethanol-fed group, histologic studies by light microscopy showed absence of protein plugs in the pancreatic ducts and/or pancreatitis, but electron-microscopic evaluation revealed progressive accumulation of lipid droplets in acinar and ductal cells. No definite changes in the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum were noticed. Biochemical studies revealed increased specific activity of trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, and lipase, and decreased specific activity of amylase. Trypsin-inhibiting capacity was decreased in the tissue and in the medium in a progressive fashion. There was no increase in the secretion of total protein. These data show a complex and a nonparallel alteration of specific digestive enzymes and trypsin inhibitor in this model of chronic ethanol intoxication that may be of relevance to occurrence of pancreatitis.
