Pancreatitis following parathyroid surgery. While pancreatitis may provide the clue to the diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism preoperatively, the occurrence of pancreatitis following parathyroidectomy is not generally recognized. In this study preoperative and postoperative serum amylase estimations, together with a clinical assessment, were performed on 86 patients undergoing neck exploration for hyperparathyroidism. It was found that postoperative hyperamylasaemia occurred in 35% of the total group, while clinically significant pancreatitis was found in 9% of cases. Pancreatitis was significantly more common when thyroidectomy was performed at the time of parathyroidectomy, occurring in 23% of this group of patients, and may be due to the blunted C-cell response of calcitonin secretion to the induced hypercalcaemia associated with operative manipulation. Careful attention should be paid to postoperative abdominal symptoms, for they may indicate pancreatitis.
