A correlation between clinical pancreatitis and isoenzyme patterns of amylase. Fifty-seven patients admitted with the clinical diagnosis of acute pancreatitis had isoamylase analysis on their sera to determine the source of their hyperamylasemia. Our objective was to correlate the isoamylase pattern with our clinical observations. Thirty-nine of 57 patients (68%) had pancreatic hyperamylasemia as expected, but 18 of 57 patients (32%) had normal levels of pancreatic amylase. The hyperamylasemia in the latter group was due either to nonpancreatic hyperamylasemia (16 of 57) of macroamylasemia (2 of 57). Consequently, hyperamylasemia associated with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting led to the incorrect diagnosis of acute pancreatitis in 32% of the patients. The measurement of isoamylase profiles can be done rapidly and inexpensively. Knowledge that hyperamylasemia is nonpancreatic in origin may have an important influence on treatment, hospitalization, and the extent of laboratory and radiologic investigation.
