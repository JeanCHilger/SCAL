Minor pancreatitis after a Billroth II gastric resection for gastroduodenal ulcer. Pancreatic complications arising after 117 Billroth II gastric resections carried out between 1976 and 1980 are evaluated. Changes in blood and urinary amylase were noted in 35% of cases. A distinction is drawn between minor forms (MPOP), and major forms (APOP), with an incidence of 34% and 1% respectively. Lastly, the question of aetiopathogenesis is discussed, with particular reference to the causal factors observed on each occasion.
