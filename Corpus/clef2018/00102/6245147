The role of host genetics in the pathogenesis of coxsackievirus infection in the pancreas of mice. The susceptibility of mice to the diabetogenic effect of the M variant of encephalomyocarditis (MEMC) virus is probably inherited as a recissive trait. Three strains of mice that were susceptible to MEMC virus, three strains that were not susceptible to MEMC virus, and three types of F1 hybrid strains were infected with the common human coxsackie virus, group B, type 4 (CB4). They were examined to determine the titer of virus and histochemistry in the pancreas, levels of blood glucose, urinalysis, glucose tolerance, and levels of plasma amylase and insulin. There was a positive correlation between MEMC virus-susceptibility (diabetes-prone) and CB4-induced beta cell degranulation with concurrent hyperinsulemia and hypoglycemia. Also, as for MEMC virus, the titer of CB4 in the pancreas was not genotype-dependent. However, there was an inverse relation between destruction of the exocrine pancreas and the effect on the endocrine pancreas. These results suggest that the genetic factors responsible for the effect of MEMC virus on the endocrine pancreas are also responsive to CB4, and the proposed recessive nature of these factors is maintained for both viruses. In contrast, these factors, which are operatively recessive traits for the effect of CB4 on the endocrine pancreas, appear to be expressed as dominant traits with respect to the exocrine pancreas.
