Studies on duodenal cyclic AMP content content in pancreatic disease after administration of pancreozymin and secretin. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) output in the duodenal contents of 11 normal subjects, 18 patients with chronic pancreatitis, six convalescing from acute pancreatitis and five with pancreatic carcinoma was measured after a single dose of pancreozymin and secretin. The technic was indirect, utilizing recovery of duodenal contents by the Dreiling tube rather than direct measurements of fluid that was not contaminated by bile. In all patients groups, cAMP output reached a peak after this stimulation with a concomitant increase of bicarbonate and amylase outputs. A significantly decreased cAMP output was observed in all pancreatic disease groups compared to the normal group. Patients with chronic pancreatitis showed a slightly decreased cAMP output, considerably decreased bicarbonate output and normal amylase output. In acute pancreatitis cAMP output was reduced with normal bicarbonate and amylase outputs. In pancreatic carcinoma cAMP decreased significantly, bicarbonate output was moderately reduced and amylase output was normal. cAMP output in all groups studied did not correlate with either bicarbonate output or amylase output.
