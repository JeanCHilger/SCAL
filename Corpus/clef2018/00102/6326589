Amylase secretion by isolated pancreatic acini after acute cholecystokinin treatment in vivo. A single dose of synthetic cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK8, 5 micrograms/kg) in a depot carrier was injected subcutaneously into rats 2 and 14 h before the removal of the pancreas and the preparation of isolated pancreatic acini. CCK8 treatment induced no significant change in body weight or total amount of pancreatic DNA, but pancreatic weight, total pancreatic protein and amylase, and the concentration of amylase and total protein relative to DNA were significantly decreased. In acini prepared from CCK8-pretreated rats, responsiveness to maximal and supramaximal concentrations of CCK8 was significantly increased, irrespective of whether the amount of amylase released was expressed relative to DNA or calculated as a percentage of the acinar content. The dose-response curves for CCK8 were similarly shaped in both CCK8-pretreated and control rats but shifted threefold toward higher concentrations of CCK8 2 or 14 h after CCK8 treatment. Specific 125I-CCK binding was significantly increased only for high-affinity binding sites. Although these observations suggest that alterations in pancreatic amylase release could be due to changes at the cholecystokinin receptor, the secretory responsiveness to maximal and supramaximal concentrations of carbachol was also increased without any change in the sensitivity. Moreover, in contrast to the cholecystokinin receptor, there was no change in the number of muscarinic receptors or in their affinity for either agonists or antagonists measured with [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
