Serum enzymes in the BB rat before and after onset of the overt diabetic syndrome. As part of a six-month prospective study of the effects of neonatal thymectomy in the spontaneously diabetic BB Wistar rat, activities of the following enzymes were determined: alkaline phosphatase (AP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine phosphokinase (CPK), glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT) and UDP-galactosyltransferase (UDPG). In prediabetics, AP and LDH levels were higher than in sham-operated, non-diabetic controls however, this increase was seen in nearly all diabetes-prone BB rats, diminishing the usefulness of these changes in discerning potential diabetics from asymptomatic, diabetes-prone rats. After onset of the syndrome, there was a striking elevation of AP values in all diabetics with no similar alteration in asymptomatic, diabetes-prone rats suggesting this was a diabetes-related phenomenon. By contrast, UDPG was the only enzyme to decrease immediately following the onset of the syndrome. Both UDPG and AP levels correlated with blood glucose, the former negatively and the latter positively, suggesting a close relationship with changes occurring after onset of the syndrome. The remaining enzymes increased only in a portion of diabetics alone (GOT, GPT) or in a portion of both diabetics and asymptomatic, diabetes-prone BB rats (LDH, CPK).
