Model of chronic pancreatitis in the dog. A model of chronic pancreatitis was developed and characterized in the dog. Pancreatitis was produced by infusion of oleic acid through a cannula in the accessory pancreatic duct. Biochemical changes included early and marked increases in serum amylase and lipase activities which returned to base line within 3 weeks, at which time the dogs were clinically normal. In dogs euthanatized within 2 weeks, pathologic changes included massive necrosis and hemorrhage, cystic spaces filled with fluid, and abscesses. Histologic features revealed acute exudative pancreatitis with pancreatic atrophy and fibrosis. In dogs killed between weeks 3 to 12, changes included: marked atrophy with remaining acini surrounded by remnants consisting of collapsed stroma, blood vessels, and pancreatic ducts marked coarse fibrosis with scattered inflammatory cells and occasional acinar tissue
