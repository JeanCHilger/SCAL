Pancreatitis in infants with a clinical diagnosis of septicemia. Considering the possibility that during septicemic processes, pancreatitis could develop, 10 infants were studied when the clinical diagnosis of septicemia was established. With this purpose, the clinical manifestations present in the patients were recorded and the activities of serum amilase and lipase were determined at 24 hour intervals during the first three days and these studies were repeated on the 5th and 7th days. The results showed an abnormally high serum lipase activity, especially in 6 of the 10 infants. The amilase was found within normal limits with a tendency to drop in certain cases. This information suggest the presence of acute pancreatitis in some of the subjects studied.
