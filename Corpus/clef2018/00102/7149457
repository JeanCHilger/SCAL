Prevention of increased pulmonary vascular permeability after pancreatitis by granulocyte depletion in sheep. We examined the role of granulocytes in the development of increased pulmonary vascular permeability during acute pancreatitis in acute sheep lung lymph preparation. One group of animals was depleted of 95% of circulating granulocytes by injection of hydroxyurea. In this group and in a second group of control animals, acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis was produced by injection of trypsin and sodium taurocholate acid into the pancreas. Pulmonary lymph flow and transvascular protein clearance increased without changes in pulmonary vascular pressures, indicating that acute pancreatitis h ad produced a pulmonary vascular injury. These changes occurred with a decrease in circulating granulocytes. Prior granulocyte depletion prevented the increases in lymph flow and protein clearance produced by pancreatitis, whereas the changes in platelet count, fibrinogen, and peritoneal fluid amylase concentrations were similar in both groups. These findings indicate that circulating granulocytes are necessary for the development of pulmonary vascular injury after acute pancreatitis.
