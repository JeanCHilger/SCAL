Pancreatic enzyme elevations after blunt trauma. Elevations in levels of the pancreatic enzymes amylase and lipase occur frequently after trauma. The purpose of this prospective study was to examine the incidence of these enzyme elevations in patients suffering blunt trauma, their natural history, and their relationship to posttraumatic pancreatitis.One hundred consecutive trauma patients were studied on admission to the surgical intensive care unit with daily serum amylase and lipase measurements, which were blinded to the clinical service. If the enzyme levels were elevated after 3 days, the patient was enrolled in the study and observed and examined daily, and enzyme levels were measured every other day. These patients were fed enterally by the clinical service if no symptoms of clinical pancreatitis were present.In 17% of patients persistent pancreatic enzyme elevations developed. These patients more frequently had had hypotension, higher Injury Severity Scores, and were more likely to have had severe head injuries than those whose enzyme levels remained normal. Five percent of those studied displayed evidence of clinical pancreatitis, and none of these patients had only isolated head injuries. Lumbar spine injuries and retroperitoneal hematomas were present more frequently in the group in whom symptomatic pancreatitis developed.After blunt trauma 17% of patients displayed persistent pancreatic enzyme elevations, but the majority remained asymptomatic despite enteral feeding. Retroperitoneal injury may identify patients at risk for pancreatitis. Patients with isolated head injuries should be fed enterally.
