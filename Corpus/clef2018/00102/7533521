Acute phase response in patients with uncomplicated and complicated endoscopic retrogradic cholangiopancreaticography. Acute phase response after endoscopic retrogradic cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP) was studied in 42 patients with suspected pancreatic or biliary diseases. In uncomplicated cases acute phase response determined by serum C-reactive protein levels was rare and did not parallel the serum amylase or lipase levels. In three of the these 42 patients, post-ERCP pancreatitis developed and CRP levels elevated sharply and paralleled the degree of pancreatitis. Six additional patients outside of this prospective study with post-ERCP-pancreatitis and daily CRP determinations were used to determine the CRP-response curve in post-ERCP pancreatitis.
