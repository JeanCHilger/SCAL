Effect of endothelin-1 on the development of hemorrhagic pancreatitis in rats. It has been hypothesized that microcirculatory disturbance plays an important role in the development of severe pancreatitis. In this study we investigated the effects of exogenous endothelin-1 on the development of severe pancreatitis in rats.Acute pancreatitis was induced by two intraperitoneal injections of cerulein (10 micrograms/kg body weight). Endothelin-1 was administered via an abdominal aortic catheter as a bolus of 250-750 pmol/kg BW every hour for 4 h.Remarkable morphologic changes in the pancreas, including hemorrhage, and increases in serum amylase level and active elastase content in pancreatic tissue were observed in rats treated with cerulein plus endothelin-1 in a dose-dependent manner 5 h after the first cerulein injection. Local pancreatic blood flow decreased significantly, and microcirculatory disturbances in the pancreas were demonstrated.These results suggest that endothelin-1 causes pancreatic microcirculatory disturbance and might be a contributing factor in the aggravation of acute pancreatitis.
