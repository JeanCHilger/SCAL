Effect of the cholecystokinin receptor antagonist loxiglumide on pancreatic exocrine function in rats after acute pancreatitis. Recent studies have demonstrated that cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonists not only reduce the severity of pancreatitis but also inhibit pancreatic regeneration after pancreatitis. This study was undertaken, therefore, to examine the effects of the CCK receptor antagonist loxiglumide on the exocrine pancreas when given after an episode of acute pancreatitis that was induced in rats by a 4-h subcutaneous infusion of 20 micrograms/kg body weight/h cerulein. Biochemical changes and secretory function in response to 100 ng/kg body weight cerulein were determined after a 6-day treatment with saline, loxiglumide (50 mg/kg body weight), or CCK-8 (2.5 micrograms/kg body weight), which was given three times a day starting 24 h after the induction of acute pancreatitis. In the saline-treated rats, pancreatic enzyme contents and pancreatic juice and protein output were significantly low, whereas the pancreatic weight and protein and DNA contents were comparable to those of the controls without pancreatitis. Loxiglumide treatment, although significantly decreasing protein output, had no influence on pancreatic weight, protein and DNA contents, or pancreatic juice flow but increased the amylase and lipase contents compared to those of the saline-treated postpancreatitic rats. CCK-8 treatment also had no influence on pancreatic weight or protein and DNA contents but significantly increased the pancreatic enzyme contents and pancreatic juice and protein output compared to those of the saline-treated postpancreatitic rats. These results suggest that loxiglumide does not significantly inhibit the recovery of exocrine function but appears to accelerate the increase in pancreatic amylase and lipase contents even when given after an attack of acute pancreatitis.
