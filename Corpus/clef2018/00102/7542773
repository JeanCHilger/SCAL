Activation of trypsinogen in experimental models of acute pancreatitis in rats. Trypsinogen activation peptide (TAP) concentration and alpha 2-macroglobulin-trypsin complex (alpha 2M-T) activity were measured in two experimental models of acute pancreatitis in rats to evaluate the significance of activation of trypsinogen in acute pancreatitis. TAP concentration and alpha 2M-T activity in serum rose significantly in trypsin-taurocholate-induced hemorrhagic acute pancreatitis, while in cerulein-induced edematous acute pancreatitis they did not rise in spite of a similar increase in immunoreactive trypsin. When rats in trypsin-taurocholate-induced pancreatitis were treated by protease inhibitor (FUT-175 nafamostat mesilate
