The endogenous scavengers in cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis. Studies in animal models suggest that oxygen radicals are important in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis. Cerulein, a decapeptide isolated from the skin of the frog, Hyla caerula, is closely related to the C-terminus of cholecystokinin and it is a potent stimulant of pancreatic exocrine secretion. The aim of the present study was to measure the activity of endogenous scavengers, superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione levels in cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in rats. We found that the plasma amylase and ribonuclease levels in the pancreatitis group were both significantly high (p < 0.01, p < 0.05, respectively) when compared with the control group. Although superoxide dismutase and glutathione levels of pancreatic tissue were decreased significantly (p < 0.01, p < 0.01 respectively), we observed a significant increase (p < 0.01) in catalase activity in the cerulein treated group compared to the control group. Therefore, we concluded that the profound alteration of the activities of endogenous scavengers (superoxide dismutase, catalase) and glutathione depletion occurring after cerulein-induced pancreatitis seemed to be important in tissue injury and may provide the basis for successful therapy of the disease.
