Role of xanthine oxidase and eicosanoids in development of pancreatic ischemia-reperfusion injury. The implication of different eicosanoids and oxygen free radicals in the development of pancreatic injury after an ischemia-reperfusion process has been evaluated. For this purpose we have compared the effect of allopurinol and indomethacin administration on the pancreatic levels of eicosanoids in a rat model of pancreatic ischemia-reperfusion. After 60 min of pancreatic ischemia and 2 h of reperfusion, significant increases in 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, PGE2, and LTB4 in pancreas tissue were detected. Allopurinol before the ischemic period reduced 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, PGE2, and LTB4 levels to the range of basal values, while prior indomethacin treatment significantly reduced 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and PGE2 levels, with LTB4 remaining unmodified. Increased postischemic plasma lipases were also significantly reduced by allopurinol to the range of sham-operated animals whereas indomethacin did not modify these levels. The data suggest a role for lipoxygenase metabolites in the development of pancreatic injury and the importance of the enzyme xanthine oxidase as an inductor of eicosanoid biosynthesis.
