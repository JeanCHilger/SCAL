A bradykinin antagonist inhibited nitric oxide generation and thromboxane biosynthesis in acute pancreatitis. The effect of bradykinin on nitric oxide generation and eicosanoid production in the early stage of an experimental model of acute necrotizing pancreatitis induced by sodium taurocholate has been evaluated. We have compared the effect of administering a long-acting bradykinin antagonist, HOE 140, and an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl esther L-NAME) on pancreatic prostanoid synthesis. Plasma lipase levels were increased after acute pancreatitis induction, and reduced after HOE 140 or L-NAME administration. Nitric oxide production and thromboxane B2 levels were increased after pancreatitis induction and the increases were reduced by L-NAME or HOE 140 administration. In contrast, increased prostacyclin production, reflected as 6-keto-PGF1 alpha levels, was not modified by L-NAME or HOE 140. Bradykinin seems to be involved in nitric oxide and thromboxane synthesis during the initial phases of acute necrohemorrhagic pancreatitis.
