Acute pancreatitis after open-heart surgery. A 53-year-old man after open-heart surgery was referred with complaints of abdominal pain, fever and nausea. Laboratory results and imaging tests suggested acute pancreatitis. We draw attention to this frequent complication of open-heart surgery, which is not sufficiently emphasized in clinical practice. The diagnosis is frequently difficult, due to the nonspecific presentation of the disease in the context of hyperamylasemia secondary to open-heart surgery. It is therefore very important to check amylase and lipase levels. The disease has high morbidity and mortality, hence the importance of early diagnosis and treatment.
