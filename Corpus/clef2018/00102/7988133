Failure of pentoxifylline to ameliorate severe acute pancreatitis in the rat: results of a prospective, randomized, controlled study. To investigate the benefit of pentoxifylline in severe experimental pancreatitis.Prospective, randomized, controlled study.Experimental animal laboratory in a University hospital.Forty-two adult male Sprague-Dawley rats.Acute pancreatitis was induced by supramaximal stimulation with cerulein plus a pressure and volume controlled 10 min intraductal infusion of 10-mM glycodeoxycholic acid. Thirty minutes after pancreatitis was induced, animals were randomized to receive pentoxifylline (60 mg/kg over 2.5 hrs), or saline. All animals received fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution (8 mL/kg/hr), and surviving animals were killed at 24 hrs.There was a progressively significant decrease in mean arterial pressure after pancreatitis was induced, with no difference between pentoxifylline-treated rats and controls. Hematocrit increased significantly in both groups at 6 hrs, and returned to baseline values at 24 hrs. Ascites volume and levels of trypsinogen activation peptide in plasma and ascites were similar in both groups. Twenty-four hour mortality was 47% for the pentoxifylline group and 52% for the control group. Histologic scores for necrosis, edema, inflammation, and hemorrhage showed no significant differences between the two groups.Treatment with pentoxifylline failed to improve outcome in a model of severe acute pancreatitis in the rat.
