Clinical pharmacology of pancreatic enzymes in patients with cystic fibrosis and in vitro performance of microencapsulated formulations. Improving protein and fat absorption in patients with cystic fibrosis relates to the amount of biologically active enzyme reaching the duodenum. Microencapsulated formulations are more effective than conventional products but differ in content, ability to retard acid inactivation and the pH at which they release enzymes. Contaminants in these products contribute to hyperuricosuria.
