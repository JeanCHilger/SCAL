Enzyme liberation and activation of the kallikrein-kinin system in experimental pancreatitis. Studies of portal vein blood, pancreatic lymph and peritoneal effusion. The clinical course of acute pancreatitis is strongly influenced by secondary cardiac, pulmonary and renal damage. The aim of the present study was to gather information about the compartment promoting the systemic damage. Therefore the activity of lipase, phospholipase A and plasma pro-kallikrein and the concentration of tissue kallikrein and kininogen were measured in portal venous blood, pancreatic lymph and peritoneal exudate. Anaesthetized pigs were subjected to fluid resuscitation to keep systemic haemodynamic parameters constant. The pancreas was isolated in situ. The pigs were randomly assigned to a control group (n = 9) or one of the two pancreatitis groups (n = 10 each). Pancreatitis was induced by i.a. infusion of free fatty acid (FFS) or retrograde infusion of 5% sodium taurocholate intraductally (NaT). In both pancreatitis groups the activity of lipase and phospholipase A increased. The most pronounced changes were seen in the peritoneal exudate (phospholipase A activity 40 min after induction: control 10.0 U/l, NaT 72.2 U/l). In both pancreatitis groups there was evidence for activation of the tissue kallikrein kinin system in the form of an increase in the kallikrein concentration and a decrease in the kininogen concentration. Again the changes were most pronounced in the peritoneal exudate (tissue kallikrein 40 min after induction: control 14.7 ng/ml, NaT 452 ng/ml).
