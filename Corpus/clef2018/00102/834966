Serum calcitonin in acute pancreatitis in man. Serum calcitonin (Ct) levels, serum calcium, and urine amylast were analyzed in 29 patients with an acute pancreatitis collected at random. In two of the patients the acute pancreatitis complicated a primary hyperparathyroidism. It was found that the calcitonin levels in serum were usually elevated during the acute phase of the pancreatitis. During this phase of the disease 22 of 27 examined patients had Ct-values above the upper normal limit of 1 mug/ml. The patients with normal Ct-values also had moderately elevated amylast values and a less pronounced pancreatitis. Normal Ct-values were usually found in patients more than 10 days after the onset of symptoms. Serum calcium was mostly within normal limits. However, a slight fall in serum calcium or low values was recorded in six patients with a pronounced disese. One patient with hyperparathyroidism normalized a previously elevated serum calcium during the calcitonin release.
