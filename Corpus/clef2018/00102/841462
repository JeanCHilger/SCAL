Pancreatic duct obstruction with an acrylate glue: a new method for producing pancreatic exocrine atrophy. Ten dogs have been used in a study which demonstrates the feasibility of producing total pancreatic duct obstruction with alkyl-alpha-cyanoacrylate glue. Low pressure injection of glue into the pancreatic duct has led to a reproducible pancreatic atrophy with preservation of the islets. A sharp rise in serum amylase was noted in each dog, but at autopsy examination at monthly intervals after the operation, no evidence of chronic pancreatitis was observed. None of the dogs was rendered diabetic. The success of the experimental technique raises the possibility that such a technique might be useful in the management of human chronic pancreatitis as an alternative to pancreatic resection, and the operation has been performed on three patients so far.
