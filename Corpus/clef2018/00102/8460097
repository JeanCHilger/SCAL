Effect of a new synthetic trypsin inhibitor on taurocholate-induced acute pancreatitis in rats. The effect of a novel synthetic trypsin inhibitor, 4-sulfamoylphenyl 4-guanidinobenzoate methanesulfonate (ONO-3307), on severe acute pancreatitis was studied by changing its timing, frequency, and dose in trypsin-taurocholate-induced acute experimental pancreatitis in rats. Rats were divided into four groups according to difference of ONO-3307 administration: group A, 2 mg/0.5 ml of ONO-3307 s.c. 1 h before and after induction of pancreatitis group B, 2 mg/0.5 ml s.c. 1 and 3 h after
