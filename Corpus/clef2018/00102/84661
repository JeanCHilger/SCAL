Effect of chlorophyll-a, fluorouracil, and pituitrin on experimental acute pancreatitis. Intraductal administration of enterokinase in rats produced hyperamylasemia and acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis. The experimental pancreatitis and hyperamylasemia could be prevented by the concomitant intraductal injection of fluorouracil, pituitrin, or chlorophyll-a. The clinical implication of the study is that these agents, if given intraductally, may be useful in the prevention of iatrogenic hyperamylasemia and acute pancreatitis that may occur after endoscopic retrograde pancreatocholangiography.
