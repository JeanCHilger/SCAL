Varicella-zoster virus pancreatitis in hematologic diseases. We report four cases of varicella-zoster pancreatitis in immunocompromised hosts. All 4 patients presented a severe immunodeficiency because of chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (mainly lymphoma and Hodgkin disease) and long-term immunosuppressive therapy. Varicella zoster pancreatitis is a very unusual presentation of varicella-zoster infection. Few cases of pancreatitis occurring after bone marrow transplantation have been reported. All 4 patients presented with acute epigastric pain associated with transient elevation of serum amylase. The vesicular rash followed the presenting symptoms of severe abdominal pain by 8 days. This clinical presentation, occurring in immunocompromised patients, defines a set of symptoms which should lead the physician to suspect varicella-zoster pancreatitis, even in the initial absence of the characteristic skin vesicular eruption. Early institution of antiviral therapy seems mandatory.
