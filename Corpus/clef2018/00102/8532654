Does acute pancreatitis progress to chronic pancreatitis? A microvascular pancreatitis model in the rat. Ischemia as a causative factor for acute pancreatitis has been discussed for decades but has only recently gained wider acceptance. Chronic pancreatitis, however, has rarely been attributed to ischemic injury. While experimental evidence is available for the ischemic pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis, no studies have been reported about pancreatic ischemia as a single cause of chronic pancreatitis. Also, the progression from acute to chronic pancreatitis has been a very controversial issue. To address both questions we have injected polystyrene microspheres of 20-microns diameter into the pancreatic branches of the splenic artery of 36 rats. Thirteen more rats were sham operated and injected with saline. The animals were killed at 1, 2, 3, and 9 weeks after operation and macroscopically and histologically examined, and serum alpha-amylase and weight gain were determined. For the pancreas the following parameters were assessed using a score from 0 (no change) to 4 (severe change): atrophy, hemorrhage, edema, fat necrosis, acinar necrosis, polymorphonuclear infiltration, mononuclear infiltration, interstitial fibrosis, and ductal changes. While no difference between control and experiment was observed for serum alpha-amylase, weight gain, edema, and hemorrhage, persistent differences were evident for the parameters characteristic of chronic pancreatitis, most significantly for interstitial fibrosis, ductal changes, mononuclear infiltration, acinar necrosis, and atrophy. No spontaneous deaths occurred. The severity of the lesions remained stationary after the first week. Our work shows for the first time that pancreatic ischemia by microvascular hypoperfusion can cause histopathologic changes characteristic of chronic pancreatitis and that these changes follow acute necrotizing pancreatitis.
