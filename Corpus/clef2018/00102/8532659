Effects of pancreaticobiliary duct obstruction on the exocrine and endocrine rat pancreas. Experimentally, biliary obstruction can produce morphological and functional changes in the pancreatic gland, whereas pancreatic obstruction may have short-term (hyperamylasemia, pancreatic edema, and lysosomal hydrolase redistribution) or long-term (acinar cell atrophy and interstitial fibrosis) effects. We created a pancreaticobiliary duct obstruction in rats to evaluate (a) exocrine and endocrine anatomobiochemical pancreatic modifications (b) structural and functional liver alterations
