Nitric oxide modulates pancreatic edema formation in rat caerulein-induced pancreatitis. This study was designed to investigate the role of nitric oxide (NO) in the formation of pancreatic edema in caerulein-induced pancreatitis in rats. Pancreatitis was produced by two intraperitoneal injections of caerulein, and plasma amylase concentration, pancreatic edema index (pancreatic wet weight/body weight), and Evans blue extravasation (as a measure of vascular permeability) were evaluated 5 h after the first injection. Four doses (1, 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg) of NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA), an NO synthase inhibitor, were subcutaneously administered at -0.5, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5 h after the first injection of caerulein. L-NNA significantly lowered the edema index, the wet/dry weight ratio of the pancreas, and Evans blue extravasation in the rats with pancreatitis. The maximal effect was obtained by L-NNA at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg this inhibited the increase in pancreatic edema formation from the control value by 60%-70%. Intraperitoneal injections (20 mg/kg, five times) of L-arginine, a substrate for NO production, partly reversed the L-NNA-induced inhibition of pancreatic edema formation, but D-arginine, an enantiomer of L-arginine, did not show any effect. Plasma amylase concentrations were not significantly affected by any dose of L-NNA, nor were they affected by L- or D-arginine. These findings strongly suggest that endogenous NO plays an important role in the formation of pancreatic edema in caerulein-induced pancreatitis in rats, probably by increasing vascular permeability and protein extravasation.
