The effect of chronic intraperitoneal infusion of bacterial endotoxin on exocrine pancreas function in rats. This study demonstrated that LPS infusion can induce tissue lesions and impair the exocrine protein secretion of the pancreas in rats.The effect of chronic ip infusion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the exocrine pancreas function was studies in rats.Four milligrams per kilogram per day of Salmonella typhi LPS were infused intraperitoneally by means of surgically implanted osmotic pumps. Rats were studied after 7-d LPS infusion.Plasma fibrinogen and amylase activity increased significantly in LPS-treated rats when compared with control rats. Histological examination of the pancreas showed congestion, infiltration, and focal necrosis in LPS-treated rats. The pancreas wet weight, as well as DNA and total soluble protein contents were significantly increased in LPS-treated animals when compared with controls. The pancreas protein output was significantly decreased in pure pancreatic juice, whereas the pancreatic juice flow rate was significantly increased in LPS-treated animals, when compared with controls. Electrophoretic patterns showed a marked decrease in digestive enzyme contents, whereas there was an increased content of 15 kDa protein.
