A cause of misleading serum amylase concentrations in acute pancreatitis. The operative discovery of acute pancreatitis associated with gross hyperlipidaemia but a normal or high elevated serum amylase concentration has been described. We report a case of acute pancreatitis in which serial dilutions of serum resulted in a 338% rise in the serum amylase concentrations. The importance of appreciating this effect of hyperlipidaemia on the serum level measurements in patients with acute pancreatitis is re-emphasised.
