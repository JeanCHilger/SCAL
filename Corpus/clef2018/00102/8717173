Immune paralysis in acute pancreatitis--HLA-DR antigen expression on CD14+DR+ monocytes. Determination of the prognosis in acute cases of pancreatitis, particularly in its serious and necrotizing form, still presents problems. Patients require intensive care and suffer from severe septic complications that do not correlate with pancreatic enzyme levels (amylase lipase).Thirty-one patients with acute pancreatitis were examined: group 1 -- necrotizing pancreatitis (lethal outcome n = 7) group 2 -- necrotizing pancreatitis (surviving n = 12)When groups 1 and 2 were compared with group 3, HLA-DR values on monocytes were significantly different following the third day after admission (P < 0.01). Comparison of groups 1 and 2 were significant from the third day of observation (P < 0.001). During all 11 days of observation, patients in group 1 remained in immune paralysis (HLA-DR expression on monocytes CD14+DR+20% antigen density). All of these patients had infected necroses. Patients in group 2 overcame their immune paralysis. HLA-DR depression of monocytes and a long-standing high C-reactive protein level are almost certain predictors of a fatal outcome in cases with severe pancreatitis. A routine passage cytometric check/FACS to determine the activity of monocytes (HLA-DR) is of prognostic significance.
