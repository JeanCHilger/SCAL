Hyperamylasaemia in multiple myeloma. A 71-year-old woman, known to have multiple myeloma, was admitted because of fever, abdominal pain and hyperamylasaemia and hyperamylasuria. She was diagnosed as having acute pancreatitis. Because the diagnosis could not be confirmed, and serum lipase was normal, it appeared that this patient had developed an amylase-producing myeloma lesion in the pelvis.
