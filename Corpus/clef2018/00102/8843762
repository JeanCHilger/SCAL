Detection of nitric oxide production and its role in pancreatic ischemia-reperfusion in rats. Partial ischemia of rat pancreas body and tail was obtained by occlusion of the celiac axis for 1 h after gastrectomy. The plasma level of nitrite plus nitrate in both systemic and portal venous blood after reperfusion was significantly higher than that after sham operation and ischemia alone. The elevation after reperfusion was significantly decreased by NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). Simultaneous administration of L-arginine counteracted the L-NAME-induced decrease in the level of nitric oxide (NO) end products. Generation of NO was further demonstrated by nitrosylhemoglobin detection by electron spin resonance in the blood after reperfusion. On the other hand, the plasma level of lipase, a marker of damage to pancreatic exocrine tissue, was significantly increased after ischemia-reperfusion and further increased by administration of L-NAME. This increase in lipase correlated with a decrease in tissue blood flow in the pancreas. These results suggest that NO is generated during and may have a protective role in ischemia-reperfusion of the rat pancreas.
