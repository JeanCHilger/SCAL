Catalytic properties and stability of lipase purified from human pancreatic juice. Catalytic properties of a preparation of human pancreatic lipase purified from pancreatic juice have been compared to those of the enzyme present in pooled plasma from patients suffering from acute pancreatitis. They were very similar as regards influence of effectors (sodium deoxycholate, colipase and Ca2+), optimal pH and apparent KM in optimized conditions. The stability of the preparation appeared to be satisfactory. It was found to be stable for at least 200 days in a liquid form at +4 degrees C and predictive degradation rates per year of the lyophilized form at +4 degrees C and -20 degrees C were 0.06% and 0.00%, respectively. The close similarity of properties of this preparation with those of a recombinant human pancreatic lipase produced in V79 Chinese hamster lung cells suggests that both approaches (purification from human pancreatic juice and gene transfer technology) could be used to produce a suitable reference material for this enzyme.
