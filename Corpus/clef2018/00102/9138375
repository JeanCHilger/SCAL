Pancreas divisium as a cause of chronic pancreatitis. Clinical case. We report a 6 years old girl with chronic pancreatitis, presenting as recurring bouts of abdominal pain and hyperamylasemia, secondary to a lack of communication between the main papilla and pancreatic duct (pancreas divisium). The diagnosis was made during an intraoperative pancreatography and treatment consisted in a sphincteroplasty of the secondary papilla.
