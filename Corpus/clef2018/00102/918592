Alcohol-induced hyperlipoproteinemia. Tests on 100 alcoholic patients revealed increased lipoprotein levels in 24%. Type IV was the most frequently ecountered (80%), followed by type II or V. The average plasma triglyceride level of the alcoholic group was significantly increased in comparison with a control population. The causal mechanism of alcoholic hyperlipoproteinemia remains poorly understood. The combination of a genetic defect of lipid metabolism, nutritional factors and acute alcohol excess may have an essential bearing on the incidence of hyperlipoproteinemia. Acute excessive intake of alcohol was significantly increased in comparison with alcoholic subjects wihtout hyperlipoproteinemia. The critical dose may be a daily ethanol consumption of about 200 gm. There appeared to be no correlation between acute pancreatic injury or active liver disease and serum lipid elevation. On the other hand, the observation was confirmed that alcoholic patients with hepatic cirrhosis usually do not develop hyperlipoproteinemia. Ethanol-induced hyperlipoproteinemia may be a risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis and pancreatitis.
