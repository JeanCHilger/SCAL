Effect of ageing on pancreatic hyperplasia after 90% proximal small bowel resection. The present study was performed to examine the effect of ageing on pancreatic hyperplasia observed after proximal small bowel resection (PSBR). Young and old Wistar rats were randomly assigned to two groups, which underwent either an approximate 90% PSBR or a jejunal and ileal transection (TRC). One week after the operation, the pancreatic wet weight and the protein, DNA and RNA content of the pancreas were all significantly higher in young PSBR rats than in young TRC rats. However, no differences were seen in the old rat groups. Plasma enteroglucagon levels were elevated in both young and old PSBR rats, but the ratio of increase between the PSBR and TRC groups was significantly higher in young rats. Plasma cholecystokinin and gastrin levels did not increase after PSBR in either the young or old rats. These findings suggest that pancreatic hyperplasia observed after PSBR is attenuated by ageing, probably due to an insufficient increase in plasma enteroglucagon levels.
