Manganese superoxide dismutase: a marker of ischemia-reperfusion injury in acute pancreatitis? Recent evidence has suggested that ischemia-reperfusion injury is fundamental to the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis. This study was designed to determine whether acute pancreatitis is associated with elevated serum manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), a key antioxidant enzyme, considered a marker of ischemia-reperfusion injury in myocardial infarction. Thirty-four patients with acute pancreatitis had measurements of MnSOD on days 0, 2, and 5 after recruitment. The patients were recruited within 12 h of admission to hospital and had measurements of MnSOD on days 0, 2, and 5. Patients with severe acute pancreatitis had significantly elevated serum MnSOD concentrations on days 2 and 5 compared with patients with mild acute pancreatitis, but not on the day of recruitment. Elevated serum MnSOD correlated with peripheral plasma markers of lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde) and neutrophil activation (myeloperoxidase) and was associated with decreased plasma ascorbic acid concentrations. The serial measurement of serum MnSOD may prove useful as a marker of the effectiveness of treatment designed to limit ischemia-reperfusion injury in patients with severe acute pancreatitis.
