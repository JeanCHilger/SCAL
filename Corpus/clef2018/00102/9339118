Acute pancreatitis in a patient with glutaric acidemia type II. We describe a two-year-old girl who presented with coma following an upper respiratory tract infection. Nonketotic hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis and mild hyperammonemia were detected. The urinary organic acid profile was consistent with glutaric aciduria type II. Pancreatitis was diagnosed at autopsy. Although pancreatitis has been described in a number of inborn errors of metabolism including organic acidemias, to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of acute pancreatitis occurring in glutaric acidemia type II. It was stressed, therefore, that this complication should be searched for in organic aciduria patients, and the measurement of plasma amylase and lipase levels should be added to the battery of laboratory investigations in such cases.
