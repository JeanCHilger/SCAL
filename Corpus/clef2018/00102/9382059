Clinical value of pancreatitis-associated protein in acute pancreatitis. Pancreatitis-associated protein (PAP) is a secretory protein that is overexpressed by the pancreas during acute pancreatitis. This study was carried out to assess the clinical value of PAP in acute pancreatitis, particularly its ability to indicate the severity of the disease.Twenty-one healthy subjects, 58 patients with acute pancreatitis, and 20 patients with nonpancreatic acute abdomen were studied. In addition to serum PAP concentration, serum concentrations of amylase, lipase, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured at admission and, in patients with acute pancreatitis, during the following 5 days.On admission, serum PAP concentrations were abnormally high in 46 of the 58 patients with acute pancreatitis (79%) serum amylase, in 57 patients (98%)Our results indicate that the clinical value of PAP in acute pancreatitis is quite limited and, in particular, that PAP is not a useful marker for determining the severity of the disease.
