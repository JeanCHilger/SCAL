Rhubarb decoction prevents intestinal bacterial translocation during necrotic pancreatitis. This is a study on the efficacy and mechanism of rhubarb therapy for necrotizing pancreatitis in rats induce by intraductal infusion of 2% deoxycholate 0.4 ml/kg. The rats with such pancreatitis were orally fed with 10% rhubarb decoction 1.5 ml (treatment group n = 8) or normal saline 1.5 ml (control group n = 9) per 8 hours. Sham operated rats (sham group n = 8) were given intraductal infusion of normal saline 0.4 ml/kg. 48 hours after infusion, the rats were killed for studies of intestinal motility, serum endotoxin and amylase levels as well as bacterial cultures in messentary lymph nodes (MLN) and pancreas tissues. 5 rats died in the control group (5/9) and 1 died in the treatment group (1/8). Remarkable inhibition of gut motility was observed in control group, but gut motility was significantly improved by administration of rhubarb in treatment group. No rat died in the sham group and the rate therein were all free from endotoxemia or positive cultures. Endotoxin level of control group is much higher (61.36 +/- 28.30 pg/L) than that of treatment group (5.41 +/- 3.58 pg/L), (P < 0.001). Positive cultures were noted in most of MLN (4/4) and pancreas (4/4) in control group, but only 1 in MLN and 1 in pancreas were noted in treatment group. It is concluded that in the treatment of necrotic pancreatitis in rats rhubarb decoction is effective for promoting gut motility and preventing intestinal bacterial translocation.
