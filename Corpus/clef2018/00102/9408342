The effects of glucocorticoids and a glucocorticoid antagonist (RU 38486) on experimental acute pancreatitis in rat. The effects of glucocorticoids on acute pancreatitis are a matter of dispute. In animal experiments, dexamethasone and hydrocortisone significantly decreased the serum amylase activities 8 hours after the induction of pancreatitis. In the dexamethasone treated group, the serum IL-6 level was significantly decreased at 4 and 8 hours, while in the hydrocortisone treated group, all the IL-6 values were significantly diminished vs. the control group. As compared to the control, a glucocorticoid antagonist (RU 38486) did not influence the serum amylase activity, but significantly increased the serum IL-6 level. These results suggest that glucocorticoids may play a role in the control of pancreatitis caused by inhibition of cytokine production.
