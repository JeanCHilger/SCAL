Increased serum trypsinogen 2 and trypsin 2-alpha 1 antitrypsin complex values identify endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography induced pancreatitis with high accuracy. To evaluate the clinical utility of two new tests for serum trypsinogen 2 and trypsin 2-alpha 1 antitrypsin complex (trypsin 2-AAT) in diagnosing and assessing the severity of acute pancreatitis (AP) induced by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).Three hundred and eight consecutive patients undergoing ERCP at Helsinki University Central Hospital in 1994 and 1995.Patients were followed prospectively for pancreatitis and clinical outcome. They were tested for serum trypsinogen 2, trypsin 2-AAT, and amylase in samples obtained before and one, six, and 24 hours after ERCP.Pancreatitis developed in 31 patients (10%). Their median serum trypsinogen 2 increased 26-fold to 1401 micrograms/l at six hours after the procedure and trypsin 2-AAT showed an 11-fold increase to 88 micrograms/l at 24 hours. The increase in both markers was stronger in severe than in mild pancreatitis, and in patients without pancreatitis there was no significant increase. Baseline trypsinogen 2 and trypsin 2-AAT concentrations were elevated in 29% and 32% of patients, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of a threefold elevation over the baseline value was therefore analysed. The sensitivity and specificity of these parameters in the diagnosis of post-ERCP pancreatitis was 93% and 91%, respectively, for serum trypsinogen 2 at six hours after the examination, and 93% and 90%, for trypsin 2-AAT at 24 hours.Serum trypsinogen 2 and trypsin 2-AAT reflect pancreatic injury after ERCP. High concentrations are associated with severe pancreatic damage. The delayed increase in trypsin 2-AAT compared with trypsinogen 2 appears to reflect the pathophysiology of AP. A greater than threefold increase in trypsinogen 2 six hours after ERCP is an accurate indicator of pancreatitis.
