Changes of lysosomal enzyme activity in the lungs during the course of acute pancreatitis. The aim of this work is to study changes in activities of lysosomal enzymes of lungs in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome as complication in the course of experimental acute pancreatitis. The study was carried out on 100 male rats, Wistar strain 240-480 g weight. The healthy animals were used as control to find out to norms of activity of lysosomal enzymes of lungs (Cathepsin B, D, L, Acid phosphatase, Lipase, Sulfatase, B-D-galactosidase, N-Acetyl-B-glucosaminidase). The laparotomy was performed on 90 rats and sodium taurocholate (60 animals-OP group) and 0.9% NaCl (30 animals-OK group) was injected pancreaticoduodenal duct. The rats from OP and OK groups were divided into 5 subgroups. After 2, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours after the operation, animals were sacrificed and the lungs were dissected, weighed, frozen. After thawing the lungs in 0.9% NaCl, 1 g of lungs was sampled at ice melting point. The obtained homogenate centrifuged, supernate was poured out and centrifuged again at a speed of 14,000 rot per min. The activity of enzymes was determined in using supernate preparations by Sigma. Quantitative determination were carried out using Lowrey's method. Differences in values of enzyme activity were statistically significant, between particular groups of animals OK and OP. The highest increase in the activity of enzymes was found between 12 to 24 hours after inducing the disease, what correlated with the increase in volume of lungs. The monitoring of activity of lysosomal enzymes is a sensitive indicator to evaluate the increase of ARDS in the course of experimental acute pancreatitis.
