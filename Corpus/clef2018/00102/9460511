Cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis enhanced by chronic hyperlipidic diet in the rat. The object of the present work was to study the relationship between acute pancreatitis (PA) and hyperlipidic diets. PA was induced by Caerulein (CE) by a single intraperitoneal doses (50 mcg/kg), after feeding the rats during 6 weeks with an hyperlipidic diet (45%). Rats with a normolipidic diet (lipids 5%) were used as control. The increase of serum lipase was similar in both groups treated with CE (control and with hyperlipidic diet). There were increase of interstitial edema, cariorrexis and a specially marked increase in the level of vacuolization of acinar cells with respect to the control group. It was concluded that chronic hyperlipidic diet increases histopathologic lesions in PA induced by CE in rats.
