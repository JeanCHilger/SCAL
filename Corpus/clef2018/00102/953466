A conrolled trial of glucagon in experimental pancreatitis. This study was designed to assess the value of glucagon infusion in pigs with experimental pancreatitis. The condition was induced by injection of bile into the pancreatic duct directly after intravenous injection of secretion. Macroscopic haemorrpagic pancreatitis ensued immediately, and was accompanied by a rise in the serum amylase of five to ten times. An experimental group of 15 pigs was given glucagon by continous infusion for 18 hours beginning 18 hours after induction of pancreatitis. A control group was given intravenous saline. Fourteen of the 15 treated animals survived for 1 week and 3 died within 2 weeks, after which the remaining animals were sacrificed. Ten of the 15 controls died within the first week. Serum amylase levels in both groups began to decline when infusion was commenced, but levels in the treated group were significantly lower than in the controls. Autopsy showed prominent peripancreatic granulation tissue in the treated animals, a significant incidence of pericarditis in both groups and pancreatic pseudocysts in 3 controls and 1 treated animal. These results suggest that glucagon effectively reduced the mortality in pigs with experimental pancreatitis and that a controlled clinical trial of treatment is justified.
