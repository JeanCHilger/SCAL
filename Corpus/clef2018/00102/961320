Fibrinogen related antigens in acute pancreatitis. The fibrinogen related antigens were measured in 22 consecutive patients with acute pancreatitis. During the attack a marked elevation was seen, the values normalizing in the quiet phase. This may be due to either intravascular and/or extravascular degradation of fibrinogen-fibrin. As other authors have demonstrated intravascular coagulation experimentally in animals with pancreatitis, the authors stress that intravascular coagulation may play an important role in the patheogenesis of acute pancreatitis.
