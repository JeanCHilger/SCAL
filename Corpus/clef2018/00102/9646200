Clinical value of serum pancreatic enzymes in acute alcohol intoxication and acute alcoholic pancreatitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence in the serum of elevated levels of amylase, pancreatic isoamylase, and lipase in acute alcohol intoxication among occasional drinkers and chronic alcoholics, and to assess the diagnostic ability of the three enzymes for acute alcoholic pancreatitis.One-hundred and seventeen consecutive subjects with acute alcohol intoxication but no abdominal pain (47 occasional drinkers, 70 chronic alcoholics), and 17 with acute alcoholic pancreatitis were studied. For all subjects serum amylase, pancreatic isoamylase, and lipase were determined using commercially available kits.Among occasional drinkers, serum amylase levels were abnormally high in 6 subjects (13%), whereas serum pancreatic isoamylase and lipase were abnormally high in one, (2%). In chronic alcoholics without abdominal pain serum amylase and lipase were abnormally high in 10 subjects (14%) but serum pancreatic isoamylase in only 7 (10%). In patients with acute alcoholic pancreatitis, serum amylase and pancreatic isoamylase were abnormally high in 16 of the 17 patients (94%), whereas serum lipase was abnormally high in all.Chronic alcohol abuse, but not occasional alcohol intoxication, may cause pancreatic damage. Amylase, pancreatic isoamylase and lipase determinations in the serum are all equally useful in the diagnosis of acute alcoholic pancreatitis.
