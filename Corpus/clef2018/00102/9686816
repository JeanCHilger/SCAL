Increased serum trypsin and elastase-1 levels in patients undergoing L-asparaginase therapy. Although there is abundant literature on the association of L-asparaginase and acute pancreatitis in patients undergoing chemotherapy, few studies have investigated the usefulness of pancreatic enzyme measurement in the early diagnosis of L-asparaginase-induced acute pancreatitis. We measured levels of serum pancreatic enzymes before, during, and after L-asparaginase therapy in nine children with acute lymphocytic leukaemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Serum levels of amylase, pancreatic isoamylase, and lipase did not change between the 1st and 30th day of L-asparaginase administration. However, the serum trypsin and elastase- levels, 10 and 20 days after beginning L-asparaginase therapy, were significantly higher than those prior to therapy.L-asparaginase may induce subclinical pancreatitis and the estimation of serum trypsin and elastase-1 may be useful in the early diagnosis of L-asparaginase-induced acute pancreatitis.
