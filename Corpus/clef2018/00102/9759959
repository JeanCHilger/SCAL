Serum pancreatic enzymes in human immunodeficiency virus-infected children. A collaborative study of the Italian Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Hepatology. Numerous studies have shown pancreatic disease in adult human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, but there are very few reports on pediatric patients. Our aim was to determine the prevalence of increased serum pancreatic enzyme levels and their relationship to clinical manifestations of acute pancreatitis in HIV-infected children.Forty-seven consecutive, symptomatic HIV-infected children (24 male median age, 7.3 yearsTen of 47 HIV patients had increased serum total amylase values however fewer patients had increased specific pancreatic enzymes: 6 of 47 for pancreatic amylase (range, 1.8- to 19.8-fold normal limit) and 7 of 47 for lipase (range, 1.4- to 4-fold normal limit). Values were normal in all controls. Two HIV patients with increased total amylase had clinically evident parotid inflammation. None of the patients with increased serum pancreatic amylase and/or lipase had clinical symptoms of acute pancreatitis. Regression analysis showed no correlation between increased serum pancreatic enzyme levels and disease progression (CDC class), immunologic status (CD4 count), nutritional status, drug administration, or opportunistic infections.Fifteen per cent of HIV-infected children had biochemical evidence of pancreatic involvement however, this condition was unrelated to clinical signs of pancreatitis. Neither drug administration nor opportunistic infections seem to determine the increased serum pancreatic enzyme levels.
