Continuous calcium channel blocker infusion in experimentally induced acute pancreatitis: effects on pancreas and liver function. In this study we examined the effects of continuous calcium channel blocker (CCB) infusion on pancreatic duct-ligated acute pancreatitis (AP) in rabbits. Thirty rabbits were used for this study. Animals in group 1 (n = 10), which served as a control group, underwent dummy operations and received 0.5 microliter/h normal saline via the internal jugular vein. Animals in group 2 (n = 10) with artificially-induced pancreatitis received the same dosage of saline in the same manner. Animals in group 3 (n = 10) with artificially-induced pancreatitis received 180 micrograms/kg/h CCB (Verapamil) via the jugular vein starting from just before pancreatic duct ligation. AP histology score, plasma amylase levels and liver function tests were measured after 48 h. Verapamil infusion did not prevent the rise in plasma amylase levels, nor did it prevent pancreatic inflammation and damage. Serum levels of serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase, serum glutamate oxalacetate transaminase and alkaline phosphatase were significantly elevated in group 2 and significant reductions were seen in the Verapamil treated animals (group 3). The findings in this study imply that a continuous 180 micrograms/kg/h dose Verapamil infusion does not ameliorate the pathogenesis of pancreatitis induced by ligation of pancreatic duct but do not rule out a dose-dependent protective effect. Meanwhile, the lowering of liver function test scores should be considered the beneficial effect of CCBs, and this should be investigated in further studies.
