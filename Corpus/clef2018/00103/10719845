Response of rat exocrine pancreas to high-fat and high-carbohydrate diets. Intake of diets with high fat content is a risk factor for acute pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. The underlying mechanisms leading to the development of these diseases due to high fat intake are currently unknown. The current study was designed in rats to determine the physiologic and pathological consequences of a highfat diet that contained excess amounts of cottonseed oil or a high-carbohydrate diet that contained high amounts of sucrose on the exocrine pancreas. Rats were maintained on the diets for 4 weeks, and a cannula was inserted into the right jugular vein and one into the pancreatic duct for collection of pancreatic juice. Volume of the pancreatic juice and concentrations of amylase, lipase, and trypsinogen in the pancreatic juice were measured before and after infusions of CCK-8. Results showed that basal and CCK-stimulated pancreatic outputs of volume, amylase and lipase but not trypsinogen, were significantly elevated in intact rats given a high-fat diet when compared with rats given a high-carbohydrate diet. Forty-eight hours later, rats were sacrificed, and parts of the pancreas were removed for isolation of pancreatic acinar cells and for histopathologic studies. Pancreatic acini isolated from rats on a high-fat diet showed significantly lower basal and CCK-stimulated amylase release when compared with those on a high-carbohydrate diet. Histology of the pancreas of rats on a high-carbohydrate diet appeared normal however, the pancreas of rats on high-fat diet showed significant alterations in exocrine pancreas. These results showed abnormalities in the exocrine pancreas of rats on a high-fat diet, that were not found in rats on a high-carbohydrate diet
