The enterosorbents belosorb and panzysorb in the treatment of acute experimental pancreatitis in rats. Enterosorption with highly dispersed fibrous carbon adsorbent Belosorb or enzyme-containing fibrous carbon adsorbent Panzysorb was applied for the treatment of experimental acute pancreatitis (EAP) in the rats. Panzysorb was obtained by immobilization of digestive hydrolases (proteases and amylase) on Belosorb as matrix. It was shown that oral administration of Panzysorb (100 mg/kg body weight) significantly decreased amylolytic and lipolytic activity of blood serum by the third hour after EAP induction. The course of enterosorption (ten days) with the Panzysorb led to the appearance of regeneration focuses in injured organ.
