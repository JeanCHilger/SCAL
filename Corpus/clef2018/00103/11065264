Sonographic evaluation of the pancreatic duct in normal children and children with pancreatitis. We investigated the diameter of pancreatic duct using ultrasonography in 51 children with pancreatitis and age-matched healthy control children over a 5 year period. The diameters of pancreatic duct and pancreatic body were measured simultaneously by sonography. The mean ages of children with acute pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis were 9.7 +/- 3.9 and 10.3 +/- 3.1 years, respectively (range, 1 to 8 years). The mean age of normal children was 9.6 +/- 5.3 years. A significant difference was found in diameter of the pancreatic duct between children with acute and chronic pancreatitis versus that of age-matched control. In addition, a significant difference in diameter of the pancreatic body was found between children with acute pancreatitis and age-matched controls, but there was no marked difference in diameter of the pancreatic body between normal persons and those with chronic pancreatitis. The mean diameters of the pancreatic duct in acute pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis were 2.34 +/- 0.47 mm and 2.84 +/- 0.67 mm, respectively, which was greater than that of normal children (1.65 +/- 0.45 mm). Pancreatic ducts with diameters greater than 1.5 mm in children between 1 and 6 years, greater than 1.9 mm at ages 7 to 12 years, or greater than 2.2 mm at ages 13 to 18 years were significantly associated with the presence of acute pancreatitis. Thirty-two patients, including 25 with acute pancreatitis and 7 with chronic pancreatitis, underwent follow-up measurement of pancreatic duct and serum lipase examination on at least three occasions. A good correlation between the diameter of pancreatic duct and serum lipase level was found. Thus, ultrasonography of the pancreatic duct is valuable in diagnosis and monitoring of pancreatitis in children.
