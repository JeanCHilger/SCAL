Nitric oxide induction in a rat model of selective pancreatic ischemia and reperfusion. Ischemia and reperfusion of the pancreas may be important in aggravating the course of acute pancreatitis. In a rat model of selective pancreatic ischemia and reperfusion, we studied plasma levels of nitric oxide and expression of nitric oxide synthase in the pancrease and lung.Pancreatic ischemia was achieved by occlusion of the 4 main pancreatic arteries for 40 min this was followed by a 7-hour reperfusion period (group A, 10 rats). Outcome measures were compared with those of animals undergoing a sham operation (group B, 10 rats).Pancreatic damage in group A animals was demonstrated by increased serum alpha-amylase and by macroscopic and microscopic evidence. Total nitric oxide synthase activity in pancrease and lung was higher than in shams [median: 0.73 vs. 0.54 pmol/mg protein/min in the pancreas (P = 0.0082) 1.38 vs. 0.68 pmol/mg protein/min in the lung (P = 0.023)]Ischemia and reperfusion of the pancreas induces pancreatic damage, overexpression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and oxidative damage within the pancreas and lung.
