Urinary excretion of trypsinogen activation peptide (TAP) in taurocholate-induced pancreatitis in rats. Trypsinogen activation peptide (TAP) is a useful marker of severe acute pancreatitis. However, it is sometimes difficult to detect an elevation of plasma TAP in patients with acute pancreatitis because TAP is rapidly cleared from plasma. Therefore, urine TAP has been evaluated to provide an accurate prediction of the outcome of pancreatitis. In the present study, we examined the time course of plasma and urine TAP simultaneously after induction of taurocholate-induced pancreatitis in rats. Plasma TAP levels peaked at 1 hour after the induction of pancreatitis and then gradually decreased, but was still higher than prepancreatitis levels at 48 hours. Significant increases in urine TAP levels were seen at 0-6, 6-12, and 30-36 hours after induction of pancreatitis. The peak level of urine TAP output and TAP/creatinine ratio was observed at 6-12 and 30-36 hours, respectively. Urine TAP concentration showed a significant correlation with both urine TAP/creatinine ratio and TAP output in urine (p < 0.01). In conclusion, plasma TAP increased immediately after the induction of pancreatitis, but excretion of TAP into urine was delayed several hours in taurocholate-induced pancreatitis in rats. The measurement of urine TAP concentration alone sufficiently can reflect the amount of TAP liberated in the pancreas at initial stage of acute pancreatitis.
