Chronic pancreatitis in African diabetics. Steatorrhea due to chronic pancreatitis was found in 23 percent of a consecutive series of 107 new african diabetics 3 had pancreatic calcification. Of 16, 14 had definitely abnormal exocirne secretion function testing using secreation pancreozymin stimultion. Themorphology and function of the small intestine were normal by local standards. When compared with diabetics without steatorrhea they weighed less, their fasting blood sugars were lower, and their insulin requirements were greater. High alcoholic intake might be significant cause, but the incidence was similar in the diabetics without steatorrhea. No evidence of childhood or adult malnutrition was established. The etiology of this high incidence of chronic pancreatitis among african diabetics remains unexplained.
