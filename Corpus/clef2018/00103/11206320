Pancreatitis-associated protein-I mRNA expression in mouse pancreas is upregulated by lipopolysaccharide independent of cerulein-pancreatitis. It is well known that endotoxemia, which is caused by a bacterial infection, can exacerbate acute pancreatitis, whereas pancreatitis-associated protein (PAP) has the ability to induce bacterial aggregation. Pancreatitis-associated protein is supposed to protect the tissue from infection during inflammation. In order to clarify the relationship between PAP mRNA expression and endotoxemia during acute pancreatitis, the kinetic patterns of PAP-I mRNA in mouse pancreas treated with either cerulein or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or both were investigated in this study.The administration of LPS (5 mg/kg) intraperitoneally resulted in a dramatic upregulation of PAP-I mRNA expression, increasing 18.61-fold to a maximum at 12 h, then decreasing, but still sustaining at a high level and reaching baseline on day five. These changes were accompanied by the upregulation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interferon gamma (IFNgamma) mRNA expressions in the pancreas, but not by marked alterations of serum amylase, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) and histology. Cerulein also increased PAP-I mRNA expression. However, the combination of cerulein and LPS was not able to enhance PAP-I mRNA expression further, although more prominent pancreatitis based on significant changes of serum amylase, LDH and histology were observed.These results suggest that PAP-I mRNA might be modulated by endotoxemia, independent of cerulein-pancreatitis. There were no strong correlations between PAP-I mRNA expression and the severity of pancreatitis.
