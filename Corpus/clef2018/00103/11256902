Renal failure in acute pancreatitis. Twenty six (7.3%) of a total of 356 patients with acute renal failure were found to have acute pancreatitis as the primary disease. Seventeen (65.4%) of them were males. Their mean age was 35.6 years. Clinically epigastric pain and tenderness were seen in all (100%) nausea vomiting (73%), low grade fever (50%), left sided pleural effusion (38.4%), haemopericardium (26.9%), shock (26.9%), pseudocyst (19.3%) and adult respiratory distress syndrome (7.6%) were the other major presenting features. Serum amnylase (100%), lipase (53.8%), triglycerides (53.8%) and blood sugar (38.5%) were raised in majority whereas serum calcium was detected to be below normal in 46.2% patients. Blood urea and serum creatinine were raised in all and hyperkalacmia was found in 50% patients. CT scan and USG abdomen showed bilateral enlarged kidneys (100%), pancreatic oedema (80.7%), necrosis of pancreas (19.3%) and pseudocyst (19.3%).
