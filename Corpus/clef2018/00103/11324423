Antidiabetic effect of Oenanthe javanica flavone. To study the antidiabetic effect of Oenanthe javanica flavone (OjF).Mice were injected i.v. with alloxan 90 mg.kg-1 to induce diabetes. Blood glucose, serum lipid, and pancreatic amylase were determined with Automatic Biochemistry Analysor. Serum insulin was determined by radioimmunoassay. The pancreas and islets were examined under microscope.OjF 200 mg.kg-1 reduced the blood glucose in normal mice from 0.5 to 6 h after a single administration ig. OjF 200 and 400 mg.kg-1 ig daily for 10 d decreased the blood glucose in alloxan-induced hyperglycemic mice (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). OjF promoted the release of insulin both in normal and in diabetic mice. OjF decreased serum triglyceride and raised the lowered pancreatic amylases in diabetic mice (P < 0.01, P < 0.01). The islet-injured changes of OjF-treated group were similar to those of control in histology examination, but to a lesser degree.OjF possessed the hypoglycemic and hypotriglyceride actions, mainly concerned with promoting release of insulin from B-cells in islets of langerhans.
