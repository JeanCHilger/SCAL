Ultrathin cutting needle biopsy histology in the tissue diagnosis of acute pancreatitis--experimental study and application in a human case. This study was to assess whether the tissue obtained with an ultrathin cutting needle, that is as thin as used for aspiration cytology and bacteriology, can give enough material to diagnose acute pancreatitis in rat model and in a human case.Wistar rats were randomly allocated into control group (n = 6), cerulein group (n = 6), ligation group (n = 6) and bile salt group (n = 6). In the cerulein, ligation and bile salt groups acute pancreatitis was induced by cerulein intraperitoneal injections, low ligation of common biliopancreatic duct and sodium taurodeoxycholate intraductal injection, respectively. Serum amylase activity was measured and a large cut specimen and two ultrathin needle biopsy specimens were obtained from the pancreas for light microscopic histology. Oedema, acinar cell necrosis, haemorrhage or fat necrosis, and leukocyte infiltration were evaluated semiquantitatively and compared with large cut specimens.The pancreatitis groups revealed different severity in oedema, acinar cell necrosis, haemorrhage or fat necrosis, and leukocyte infiltration. The needle biopsy showed 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. The histopathologic scores showed a good and significant correlation between ultrathin biopsy and large cut specimens in all the four histologic parameters, especially in oedema and acinar cell necrosis. A human case is presented, whose percutaneous ultrathin needle biopsy histology was successfully applied for diagnosing acute pancreatitis.The ultrathin needle biopsy histology can give enough material for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. Further studies with ultrasonography guided percutanous or endosonography guided transduodenal technique will be needed to assess the role of tissue sampling in acute pancreatitis.
