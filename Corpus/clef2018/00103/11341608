Thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist prevents pancreatic microvascular leakage in rats with caerulein-induced acute pancreatitis. This study was designed to evaluate the protective effect of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) receptor antagonist, seratrodast, against pancreatic injuries during acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis was induced in rats by intravenous infusion of a supramaximal dose of caerulein (5 microg/kg x h for 4 h). In this model, marked hyperamylasemia, a significant increase in pancreatic water content, and a significant increase in pancreatic micro-vascular leakage of Evans blue dye were observed. Pancreatic subcellular redistribution of a lysosomal enzyme, cathepsin B from the lysosomal fraction to the zymogen fraction as well as a significant increase in pancreatic trypsin content were also observed. Pretreatment with seratrodast at a dose of 2 mg/kg (twice, 8 and 4 h before caerulein infusion) significantly inhibited these pancreatic injuries including hyperamylasemia, increased pancreatic microvascular leakage, redistribution of cathepsin B and increased pancreatic trypsin content. These results suggest that TXA2 may be involved in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis in the early stage of the disease and that TXA2 receptor antagonist might be of therapeutic value for treatment of acute pancreatitis.
