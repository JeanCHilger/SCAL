Cardiovascular lesions in pancreatitis. Data have been presented correlating changes of blood coagulability, capillary permeability, blood electrolyte content with electrocardiographic abnormalities and symptoms of coronary insufficiency. In acute pancreatitis and in acute exacerbation of chronic pancreatitis, accentuation of these vascular factors may induce symptoms of coronary disease. Data are also presented indicating abnormal blood coagulability and blood electrolyte content in patients with chronic pancreatitis. Minimal augmentation of these abnormalities may account for the "yoke" syndrome.
