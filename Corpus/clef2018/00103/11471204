Lessons from hereditary pancreatitis. For decades there has been slow progress in understanding pancreatic diseases, particularly acute and chronic pancreatitis. As a result, there were no significant advances in the management of these patients. Treatment was mostly directed towards symptomatic relief and management of complications. A simple clinical observation that multiple members of a large family are affected by acute and chronic pancreatitis, some at very young age and in the absence of any alcohol use, led physician-scientists of the Midwest Multicenter Pancreatic Study Group (investigators from the University of Cincinnati, University of Kentucky, and University of Pittsburgh) to investigate the genetic basis of hereditary pancreatitis. Using information from the human genome project, the hereditary pancreatitis gene was identified as the cationic trypsinogen gene (protease serine 1, PRSS1). This discovery has led to the identification of a number of other genes and their products playing role in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic pancreatitis. In the emerging picture of pathogenesis of acute and chronic pancreatitis, trypsin appears to play a central role. This newly acquired knowledge is setting the stage for new preventive and management strategies for hereditary and sporadic acute and chronic pancreatitis.
