Pancreatitis after surgery in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: incidence and risk factors. Acute pancreatitis has been documented as a postoperative complication in both the general surgery and orthopaedic literature. The etiology of pancreatitis in the postoperative orthopaedic population is not clear. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence and possible predisposing factors for acute pancreatitis after scoliosis surgery in adolescent patients. This is a retrospective review of records and radiographs of patients undergoing surgery for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis during a 3-year period from 1995 to 1997. Twelve of 80 patients reviewed had amylase and lipase blood levels analyzed because of abdominal symptoms. Twenty-two clinical and radiologic parameters were assessed in each patient. Seven patients (9%) had elevated serum lipase or amylase levels consistent with pancreatitis. The only statistically different parameters were age, height, body mass index, days of postoperative fasting, and hospital stay (pancreatitis patients were older and taller and had a lower body mass index, and their hospital stay was longer). Older age and lower body index mass were the only factors relating to postoperative pancreatitis.
