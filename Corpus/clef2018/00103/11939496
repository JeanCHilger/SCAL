Recommendations for the routine use of pancreatic amylase measurement instead of total amylase for the diagnosis and monitoring of pancreatic pathology. This document reviews the scientific evidence expected to persuade clinical laboratories to substitute pancreatic amylase measurement for total amylase in cases of suspected pancreatic pathology. A substantial evidence is now available to support such change. The measurement of pancreatic amylase in serum is: 1. more sensitive and specific for the detection of pancreatic tissue damage than that of the total enzyme activity, 2. easy and quick to perform in emergency conditions, 3. analytically precise in relation to its clinical application, 4. suitable for easy transfer and comparison of results from different care delivery units, and 5. characterized by well-defined decision limits for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.
