Effects on endogenous acetaldehyde production by disulfiram and ethanol feeding on rat pancreas. Exogenous acetaldehyde infusion can induce pancreatitis-like injury of the pancreas in some isolated pancreas models, whereas in vivo such treatment has failed to induce pancreatitis. In vivo exogenous acetaldehyde may not be effective because it is rapidly metabolized. The aim of this study was to investigate whether endogenous acetaldehyde accumulates in the pancreas after ethanol feeding when acetaldehyde metabolism is blocked by disulfiram, and whether this treatment can induce pancreatitis-like injury in the rat. The liver was studied for comparison. In part I of the experiment, adult male Wistar rats were given water (n = 24), ethanol (n = 24), disulfiram (n = 24), and ethanol plus disulfiram for 1 week (n = 24) or 3 weeks (n = 24) and for 3 weeks with (n = 6) and without (n = 6) hypovolemia. In part II of the experiment, rats were given water (n = 6), ethanol (n = 6), and high-dose disulfiram (n = 6) and ethanol plus high-dose disulfiram (n = 6). Ethanol and acetaldehyde concentrations in blood, liver, and pancreas were measured. Animal behavior was monitored, and weight changes, plasma amylase activity, water content, and histomorphology of the pancreas and liver were studied without knowing the group. No increases in plasma amylase activity and no histomorphologic changes in the pancreas were observed under light or electron microscopy in part I of the experiment. In part II, treatment with ethanol induced acetaldehyde accumulation in the liver (33.6 +/- 2.6 micromol/L), but to a lesser degree in the blood (9.6 +/- micromol/L) and pancreas (5.0 +/-.2 micromol/L). Ethanol plus disulfiram induced marked accumulation of acetaldehyde in the liver (83.2 +/- 15.9 micromol/L), blood (280.0 +/- 47.4 micromol/L), and pancreas (43.6 +/- 4.7 micromol/L). When tissue acetaldehyde levels reached 30 to 40 micromol/L, we found a decrease in zymogen granules along with formation of small intracytoplasmic vacuolizations in the acinar cells and accumulation of lipid droplets in the hepatocytes, whereas physiologic signs of pancreatitis (hyperamylasemia, edema) or increases in liver enzymes did not develop. High levels of acetaldehyde accumulate in the liver and pancreas with the treatment described. Although this was accompanied by lipid degeneration of the hepatocytes and some subcellular changes in the acinar cells, physiologic signs of pancreatitis did not develop. Thus acetaldehyde accumulation alone, or in combination with hypovolemia, is not responsible for the induction of acute pancreatitis.
