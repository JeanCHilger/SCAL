The prevalence of pancreatitis in organophosphate poisonings. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of pancreatitis in cases of organophosphate (OP) poisonings admitted to Yüzüncü Yil University Teaching Hospital over an 18-month period.A total of 47 patients of acute poisoning with OP insecticides attended the Emergency Department of the Yüzüncü Yil Medical School Hospital, from May 1999 to December 2000, and were prospectively studied. Serum amylase and lipase levels were studied with colorimetric assay. Serum SGOT, SGPT, LDH, CPK, K levels, leukocyte count and total hospitalization days were also evaluated.Four of 47 patients had obviously elevated amylase and lipase levels (amylase >300 U/L, lipase >60 U/L). Only two of the patients with amylase levels between 100 and 300 U/L had also elevated levels of lipase. None of the patients with normal amylase levels had elevated levels of lipase. A total of 12.76% was diagnosed as acute pancreatitis.Acute pancreatitis as a complication of OP intoxication is not a rare condition. In order to improve the outcome of OP poisoning, early diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is important and serum levels of amylase and lipase should be routinely considered carefully. In acute pancreatitis, serum levels of SGOT, SGPT, LDH and leukocyte counts may also be found to be elevated. However, serum K levels are only slightly decreased.
