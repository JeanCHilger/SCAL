A technique for safe placement of a biliary endoprosthesis after laparoscopic choledochotomy. Biliary endoprosthesis has been proposed as an alternative to T-tube placement after laparoscopic choledochotomy in an attempt to eliminate the complications associated with T-tubes. Biliary endoprostheses have been, until now, placed under fluoroscopic guidance. We present a modification of Gersin's method for endoprosthesis placement under direct vision.As of July 2001, seven patients who fulfilled the criteria for common bile duct (CBD) exploration through a choledochotomy, a biliary endoprosthesis was inserted under direct vision at the end of the procedure with primary closure of the CBD above it. In all cases, plastic biliary stents 10F in diameter were used ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length. We describe in detail the technique of CBD stent placement using the choledochoscope as the advancing device. We also propose the use of intraoperative cholangiography instead of on-table endoscopy to check the final correct position of the stent.The median postoperative hospital stay was 2 days. Two patients developed transient hyperamylasemia in the immediate postoperative period. None of the patients developed short-term complications (<30 days), namely bile leak, CBD erosion, stent occlusion, or stent migration. The long-term results revealed early return to full daily activities and normal liver function tests. Stents were removed endoscopically 4 weeks after the initial procedure except in two patients who spontaneously passed them.We propose a 10F 10-cm biliary endoprosthesis placed under direct vision as a safe, effective, time-sparing, and cost-effective adjunct to CBD exploration through a choledochotomy. Placement of the endoprosthesis is associated with low morbidity and eliminates the complications related to T-tubes.
