Results of emergency ERCP in the treatment of acute biliary pancreatitis. Indication for emergency ERCP (< 48 hours after onset of symptoms) with stone extraction from the common bile duct (CBD) in patients with biliary pancreatitis remains controversial. In our hospital emergency ERCP with stone extraction from CBD is part of the therapeutical concept in patients with biliary pancreatitis. The aim of the study was to elucidate retrospectively results and impact of this concept on morbidity and lethality in surgical intensive care patients. We included all patients with a documented indication for emergency ERCP. Among 4 466 patients (1. 1. 1999-31. 12. 2000) treated in the SICU, 37 (0.9 %) required an emergency ERCP due to a biliary pancreatitis. (26 females/11 males, 62.0 +/- 15.4 years). After ERCP stones were present in 32 of the 37 patients with subsequent successful endoscopic extraction in all cases but one. The mean duration from admission to ERCP was 11.6 +/- 10.1 hours. Bilirubin as well as amylase and lipase decreased after ERCP (p < 0.05). Only in one case an elevation of pancreatic enzymes over the pre-ERCP values was observed, an aggravation of pancreatitis was not seen in our series. In 5 of the 37 cases bile duct stones were not found after ERCP despite strong clinical suggestion (elevation of bilirubin and pancreatic enzymes, ultrasound). During the observational period 2 patients died, in one case possibly due to the ERCP. Emergency ERCP removed in our series the pancreatitis causing agent. Still considering the limitations of a retrospective study these positive results are stimulating us to continue with our therapeutical concept.
