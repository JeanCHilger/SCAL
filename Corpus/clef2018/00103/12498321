Paradigm shift in zinc: metal pathology. Zinc (Zn) is an essential, common metal in animal tissues. Zn levels were elevated in only four tissues after Zn administration, the highest increase being in the pancreas. Zn concentration was increased by metallothionein induction. Metallothionein-bound Zn significantly reduced the toxicity of the metals Cd, Cu and Hg. It should be noted that tissue Zn levels are different in experimental animals and humans. Acute pancreatitis was observed following the injection of a large dose of Zn. Different metals have different target organs. Using metal pathology, treatments may be developed to save patients suffering from hepatic and renal diseases because Zn is used to a model animal of hepatic or renal disease.
