The pH modulator chloroquine blocks trypsinogen activation peptide generation in cerulein-induced pancreatitis. We examined the effects of a weak base, chloroquine, on the trypsinogen processing in cerulein-induced pancreatitis.Immunofluorescence studies were performed using newly generated affinity-purified antibodies to the trypsinogen activation peptide (TAP).The present study showed that chloroquine pretreatment blocked intracellular TAP generation in cerulein-induced pancreatitis.These results indicate that intracellular trypsinogen activation, which plays an important role in acute pancreatitis, requires a low-pH compartment, as well as serine protease activity.
