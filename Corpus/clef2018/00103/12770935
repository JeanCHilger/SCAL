Mechanism of kinin release during experimental acute pancreatitis in rats: evidence for pro- as well as anti-inflammatory roles of oedema formation. 1 Kinin B(2) receptor antagonists or tissue kallikrein (t-KK) inhibitors prevent oedema formation and associated sequelae in caerulein-induced pancreatitis in the rat. We have now further investigated the mechanism of kinin generation in the pancreas. 2 Kinins were elevated in the pancreatic tissue already before oedema formation became manifest. Peak values (421+/-59 pmol g(-1) dry wt) were reached at 45 min and remained elevated for at least 2 h a second increase was observed at 24 h. Pretreatment with the B(2) receptor antagonist icatibant abolished kinin formation, while post-treatment was ineffective. 3 Total kininogen levels were very low in the pancreas of controls, but increased 75-fold during acute pancreatitis. This increase was absent in rats that were pretreated with icatibant. 4 During pancreatitis, t-KK-like and plasma kallikrein (p-KK)-like activity in the pancreas, as well as trypsinogen activation peptide (TAP) increased significantly. Icatibant pretreatment further augmented t-KK about 100-fold, while p-KK was significantly attenuated
