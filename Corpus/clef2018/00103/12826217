Painless pancreatitis after implantation of a biventricular assistive device. This young cardiac transplant patient developed painless acute pancreatitis within 10 days of implantation of a biventricular assist device (BIVAD). Historical, physical, laboratory, and imaging data allowed conservative management leading to a favorable outcome. Acute pancreatitis after cardiac transplantation is common with a significant mortality rate. Immunosuppression may play an important role in this process as well as infectious and pancreaticobiliary etiologies. Whereas acute pancreatitis is a well-documented complication of cardiac transplantation, this event has not previously been reported in patients who have received a BIVAD. The mechanism by which BIVAD placement may result in pancreatitis is unknown.
