Hyperamylasemia after hepatectomy in chronic liver disease patients. Postoperative hyperamylasemia after hepatectomy occurs frequently, but the mechanism is not clear.We studied the postoperative evaluation of 11 patients with hyperamylasemia after hepatectomy (Hyper-Amy group), compared with 35 patients without hyperamylasemia (Norm-Amy group), in terms of preoperative features, intraoperative findings or procedures, postoperative management and complications, parameters for pancreatitis, and comparisons in serum amylase and lipase levels between patients with chronic liver disease and those with normal livers.In preoperative features, viral infection and chronic liver disease presented much more in the Hyper-Amy group than in the Norm-Amy group, and indocyanine green 15-minute retention rate was higher in the Hyper-Amy group than in the Norm-Amy group. There were no significant differences in the intraoperative findings or procedures, or postoperative management and complications between the two groups. In parameters for pancreatitis, the serum amylase and lipase levels were higher in the Hyper-Amy group than in the Norm-Amy group on days 3, 7 and 14. In comparison, between patients with chronic liver disease and normal livers, the serum amylase levels were higher in patients with chronic liver disease than in patients with normal livers on days 7 and 14.We should pay attention to the incidence of hyperamylasemia after hepatectomy in patients with chronic liver disease, so we can give rapid treatment for pancreatitis.
