Acute experimental pancreatitis in rat induced by sodium taurocholic acid: objective quantification of pancreatic necrosis. Retrograde injection of 5% sodium taurocholic acid (TA) in Wistar rat pancreatic duct is followed by acute pancreatitis, resulting in 100% mortality within 36 h. Biochemical determinations show raised levels of amylase in ascites and blood. Necrosis has been measured using seven morphometric characteristics of pathological changes that add precise information on the type and extension of the pancreatic lesion. The percentage of necrotic tissue (by area) seems to be the most objective parameter. Necrosis appears 6 h after TA infusion, being 5.77% in extent after 12 h, 14.9% after 24 h and animals die with an area of 29.5% necrosis. This experimental model seems to one in which physiopathological and therapeutic trials on acute pancreatitis may be tried out.
