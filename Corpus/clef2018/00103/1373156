Assessment of value of pancreatic pseudocyst amylase concentration in the treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts by percutaneous evacuation. The aim of our study was to determine the value of the percutaneous pancreatic pseudocyst evacuation. We assessed the relation between the amylase concentration of the pseudocyst contents and the final outcome of the disease treated by the percutaneous evacuation. Forty-three patients with a history of acute pancreatitis and pancreatic pseudocysts larger than 5 cm in diameter that persisted beyond 6 weeks were divided into four groups relative to the amylase concentration in the pseudocystic contents and the number of evacuations. The results show a good correlation between low amylase concentration in the liquid pseudocystic contents (less than or equal to 64 WU) and the healing rate after the percutaneous evacuation (p less than 0.001). The percutaneous evacuation of the pseudocysts failed in patients with increased amylase concentrations in the pseudocyst fluid regardless of the number of evacuations. We conclude that surgical treatment is indicated in patients who have amylase-rich pseudocyst contents.
