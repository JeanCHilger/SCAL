CAPD and pancreatitis: no connection. Autopsy studies have shown that approximately 56% of patients on long-term continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) develop various pancreatic abnormalities, such as acute and chronic pancreatitis, fibrosis, and acinar dilatation. This prevalence of anatomical abnormalities is similar to that observed in patients on hemodialysis and higher than that in those with normal renal function. However, clinical acute pancreatitis is an uncommon complication of CAPD (0.9%), and this prevalence is similar to that (1.7%) of patients on hemodialysis. We can attribute acute pancreatitis in CAPD patients to no single factor. Perhaps preexisting anatomical abnormalities of the pancreas make the CAPD patient susceptible to acute pancreatitis when exposed to a variety of physiological and nonphysiological influences. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis in CAPD patients is difficult, because symptoms and signs are similar to those of dialysis-associated peritonitis. Serum amylase values three times greater than the upper limit of normal and effluent amylase greater than 100 U/L suggest the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. Serum lipase, isoamylase, and pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor are not helpful. In confirming the diagnosis, a computed tomography (CT) scan is more helpful than ultrasound, although it is positive in only 50-60% of cases. One should harbor a high index of suspicion concerning acute pancreatitis if a CAPD patient presenting with suspected peritonitis has either a negative effluent culture or does not respond to antibiotic therapy.
