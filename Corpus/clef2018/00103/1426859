Intrasplenic pancreatic pseudocyst: a case report. An intrasplenic pseudocyst associated with the acute relapsing phase of chronic pancreatitis in a 51-year-old woman is reported, with a review of the Japanese literature. The patient was admitted with a complaint of left lateral and back pain. Abdominal US and CT revealed communicating cysts at the pancreatic tail and the subcapsule of the spleen. A repeat US and CT 1 month after admission demonstrated enlargement of the cyst at the pancreatic tail. ERCP revealed a dilated main pancreatic duct without any definite evidence of stenosis, and direct communication with the cyst at the pancreatic tail. Percutaneous cystography revealed that the subcapsular cyst of the spleen, the cyst of the pancreatic tail, and the main pancreatic duct communicated with each other. The cyst contained serous fluid with an amylase content of 57,500 IU/I. Distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy was performed. Histologically, there was a nonepithelial lining on the inner surface of the cysts at the pancreatic tail and the subcapsule of the spleen. Severe chronic inflammatory changes were present in the resected tail of the pancreas. Timely surgical treatment is advocated to reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with complications of intrasplenic pseudocysts.
