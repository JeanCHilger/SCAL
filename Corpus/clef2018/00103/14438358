Serum amylase in peptic gastroduodenal perforation. A study to determine the significance of abnormally high levels. Elevated serum amylase is a frequent concomitant of perforated gastroduodenal ulcer. To determine if there might be significant correlation between an increase in amylase and some of the other factors associated with ulcer perforation, a study was made of the clinical records of 1,000 patients with perforation of gastroduodenal ulcers. Sixteen per cent of the patients had amylase levels of 200 Somogyi units or more. This rise in serum amylase comes about in cases of perforated peptic ulcer as a result of peritoneal lymphatic absorption of fluid containing pancreatic enzyme which is spilled through the perforation. Among patients with perforated ulcers and elevated serum amylase levels, the higher the amylase level, the higher the mortality rate. The factors of amount of abdominal fluid spill, the duration of the perforation before surgical closure, the size of the perforation, shock and recent ingestion of food were also studied for possible relationship with elevated serum amylase. All appeared to be statistical if not etiological associates of abnormal serum amylase levels. Because high amylase values so often occur in perforated ulcer, there is no amylase level that can be considered diagnostic of acute pancreatitis.
