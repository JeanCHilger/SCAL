Liver, pancreas and biliary tract enhanced lipoperoxidation products in pure pancreatic juice: evidence for organ-specific oxidative stress in chronic pancreatitis. Oxygen-free radicalscan play a role in the development of chronic pancreatitis, altering the redox state with damage of cell constituents and decrease in antioxidant defences.To measure levels of lipoperoxidation products, conjugated dienes and lipid hydroperoxides, in pure pancreatic juice and serum of chronic pancreatitis patients and compare them to that in controls. To investigate a possible correlation with serum indexes of pancreatic inflammation (amylase and lipase).Pancreatic juice was collected during ERCP, after secretin stimulation, in 20 patients with chronic pancreatitis and 11 controls with biliary diseases.Lipid hydroperoxide levels were determined with FOX2 method and measured as absorbance at 560 nm. Conjugated diene levels were measured using second-derivative spectroscopy.No substantial difference was present in serum levels of lipid hydroperoxides, conjugated dienes (in both isomeric forms) and isomer-ratio values between those of patients with chronic pancreatitis and controls. In pancreatic juice, there was a significant increase in lipid hydroperoxides and conjugated dienes levels (especially trans-trans isomers) in chronic pancreatitis patients compared with controls, with a decrease in cis-trans isomers and a significant difference in isomer-ratio values.Increased levels of lipid hydroperoxides and conjugated dienes in the pancreatic juice of chronic pancreatitis patients is indicative of an enhanced lipoperoxidation and antioxidants consumption in pancreatic tissue, confirmed by the decreased isomer-ratio values as an indirect index of decreased antioxidant capacity. The lack of significant difference in conjugated diene and lipid hydroperoxide levels in the serum of chronic pancreatitis patients versus that of controls suggests an oxidative stress limited to pancreatic tissue and indicative of an organ-specific pathology, confirmed by the parallel behaviour of oxidative parameters (lipid hydroperoxides and conjugated dienes) and indexes of pancreatic inflammation (amylase and lipase).
