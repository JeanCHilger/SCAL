Exocrine pancreatic function after alcoholic or biliary acute pancreatitis. There have been various studies of exocrine pancreatic function after acute pancreatitis, but few have examined the relationship between this function and the etiology of the pancreatitis. The aim of this work was to study pancreatic function in patients who had had acute alcoholic or acute biliary pancreatitis.Seventy-five patients who had had a single attack of acute pancreatitis were studied. The etiology was alcohol in 36 and cholelithiasis in 39. Pancreatic function was studied between 4 and 18 months after pancreatitis by duodenal intubation in 18 patients (8 alcohol, 10 lithiasis) and by the amino acid consumption test (AACT) in the remaining 57 (28 alcohol, 29 lithiasis). For those who underwent AACT, the test was repeated 1 year after the first examination.Among the 36 patients with alcoholic pancreatitis, most had impaired pancreatic function at both duodenal intubation (8/8, 100%) and at AACT (22/28, 78.6%) at the second test, the AACT remained pathological (18/23, 82.1%). Of the 39 patients with biliary pancreatitis, only 4 of the 10 (40%) who underwent duodenal intubation and only 5 of the 29 (17.2%) who performed AACT had pancreatic insufficiencyThe results show that after alcoholic acute pancreatitis, the pancreatic insufficiency was significantly more frequent and more severe than after biliary pancreatitis. These findings together with the fact that the insufficiency was also more persistent suggest that acute alcoholic pancreatitis may occur in a pancreas that already has chronic lesions.
