Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in presumed healthy elderly subjects. A pilot study on exocrine pancreatic function, using the 2-day para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) test, was performed on 21 healthy elderly and 26 healthy young subjects. A PABA excretion index (PEI) less than 55%, indicating moderate to severe exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), was found in 19% of the elderly group (95% confidence limits 5-42%). While the mean value of the PEI was significantly lower in the elderly compared with the young group (Mann-Whitney Z = 2.8, p less than 0.01), there was no significant difference when the elderly subgroup with PEI less than 55% was excluded. There was no evidence of a generalized moderate to severe decline in pancreatic exocrine function with increasing age a mild to moderate decline cannot be excluded.
