Influence of stress in acute pancreatitis and correlation with stress-induced gastric ulcer. In the general adaptation syndrome, gastric lesions are the first manifestation of stress. We hypothesized that acute pancreatitis (AP), an inflammatory acute disease, will be exacerbated if unchained following stress. Visceral hypersensitivity will be enhanced due to catecholaminergic discharges leading to an over-induction of the intrapancreatic cholinergic tone with increased response of the pancreocyte to cholecystokinin (CCK). Our aim was to investigate the influence of stress before AP on the later AP, and the effect of AP on underlying diseases such as gastric ulceration.The model of stress induced by restraint was followed by the bilio-pancreatic duct outlet exclusion closed duodenal loops model. The effect of autonomous arc reflex (AAR) interruption by anesthetics after stress but before AP was assessed. The participation of the vagal and sympathetic pathways and involvement of CCK-A receptors were considered. The degree of severity was evaluated using biochemical and histopathological analyses.Induction of AP after stress was more severe than in its absence. Acinar and fat necrosis, hemorrhage and neutrophil infiltrate foci were evenly distributed, being significantly greater in size and number after stress. Gastric ulceration evolved to ulcer, hemorrhage and gastric necrosis after AP triggering. Serum amylase, lipase, C-reactive protein, IL-6, IL-10 and plasmatic hsp72 as well as pancreatic and lung myeloperoxidase were significantly elevated in AP after stress while pancreatic amylase and lipase were significantly reduced. AAR blockage ameliorated AP after stress.Stress aggravates pancreatic pathology while AP deteriorates gastric pathology, and anesthetic treatment was beneficial for both. Restraint in other animal models can be useful to study the influence of stress in the evolution of other diseases.
