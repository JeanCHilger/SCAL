Urinary trypsinogen activation peptide as a marker of severe acute pancreatitis. Trypsinogen activation peptide (TAP) may be an early marker of severe pancreatitis. Previous studies have included all patients with organ failure in the group with severe pancreatitis, although patients with transient organ failure may have a good prognosis. The aim of this study was to determine the value of urinary TAP estimation for prediction of severity of acute pancreatitis, and to validate use of several markers of prediction of severity against a new, stringent definition of severity.Patients with acute pancreatitis were recruited within 24 h of onset of symptoms. Urine and blood samples were collected for 24 h, and Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II (24 h), Ranson (48 h) and Glasgow (48 h) scores were calculated. Severe acute pancreatitis was defined by the presence of a local complication or the presence of organ failure for more than 48 h.Urinary TAP levels were significantly greater in patients with severe pancreatitis than in those with mild disease during the first 36 h of admission. The highest of three estimations of TAP in the first 24 h was as effective as APACHE II at 24 h in predicting severity. At 24 h after admission, urinary TAP was better than C-reactive protein (CRP) in predicting severity. The combination of TAP and CRP at 24 h allowed identification of high- and low-risk groups. The new definition of severity excluded 24 of 190 patients with transient organ failure none of these patients died.Use of TAP improved early prediction of the severity of acute pancreatitis. Organ failure that resolves within 48 h does not signify a severe attack of acute pancreatitis.
