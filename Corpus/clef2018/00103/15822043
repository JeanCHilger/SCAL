Ulinastatin for pancreatitis after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography: a randomized, controlled trial. Pancreatitis remains the major complication of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and hyperenzymemia after ERCP is common. Because ulinastatin, a protease inhibitor, has proved effective in the treatment of acute pancreatitis, the aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of ulinastatin for the prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis and hyperenzymemia.In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients undergoing a first ERCP were randomized to receive ulinastatin (150,000 U) or placebo by intravenous infusion for 10 minutes starting immediately before ERCP. All patients were hospitalized at least 24 hours after ERCP for evaluation of clinical symptoms. Serum pancreatic enzyme levels were measured before and at 4 and 18 hours after ERCP. The primary end point was the incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis and the secondary objective was the occurrence of hyperenzymemia.A total of 406 patients were enrolled (204 in the ulinastatin group and 202 in the placebo group). There were no differences between the 2 groups regarding baseline characteristics, details of fluoroscopic findings, or endoscopic procedure. The incidence of hyperenzymemia was significantly lower in the ulinastatin group than in the placebo group (amylase, P = .011 lipase, P = .008). Six patients in the ulinastatin group and 15 patients in the placebo group developed pancreatitis (2.9% vs. 7.4%, P = .041). There was no case of severe pancreatitis in either group. Patients who received ulinastatin did not present any side effects related to the medication.Prophylactic short-term administration of ulinastatin decreases the incidence of pancreatitis and hyperenzymemia after ERCP.
