Intravenous antioxidant modulation of end-organ damage in L-arginine-induced experimental acute pancreatitis. Oxidative stress mediates acinar injury in experimental acute pancreatitis (AP) and antioxidants are depleted in human AP. This study tests the hypothesis that exogenous antioxidant supplementation ameliorates experimental AP.Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated to 1 of 4 groups (n = 5/group) and sacrificed at 72 h. AP was induced by 250 mg per 100 g body weight of 20% L-arginine hydrochloride in 0.15 mol/l sodium chloride. Group allocations were: group 1 (control) no intervention group 2 APL-arginine induced AP characterised by oedema, neutrophil infiltration, acinar cell degranulation and elevated serum amylase. Early MAOX reduced pulmonary MPO and BAL protein and reduced acinar swelling, degranulation and pancreatic parenchymal infiltration by inflammatory cells. These features were absent when intervention was delayed.In this model, early but not late antioxidant intervention ameliorates pancreatic and pulmonary injury.
