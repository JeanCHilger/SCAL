Pancreatic exocrine and endocrine events occur concomitantly but independently during the course of fulminant type 1 diabetes. Although pancreatic exocrine enzymes are often elevated in patients with fulminant type 1 diabetes, the onset of this elevation and its significance in disease development remain unclear. We therefore investigated the significance of elevated serum enzyme concentrations and pancreatic swelling in the development of fulminant type 1 diabetes. Serum pancreatic exocrine enzymes, including amylase, elastase-I, lipase and trypsin, were measured during the course of the disease in 11 patients with fulminant type 1 diabetes (3 men and 8 women a range of age 24-73 years, median 33 years
