Purtscher's retinopathy that occurred 6 months before acute pancreatitis. To report Purtscher's retinopathy in a patient with chronic pancreatitis 6 months before the development of fulminant acute pancreatitis.Observational case report.Review of clinical chart, photographs, fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography.A 45-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse with a 3-day history of decreased vision in both eyes was examined. Diffuse retinal whitening and intraretinal hemorrhages that were consistent with Purtscher's retinopathy were present in both eyes. Serum amylase and lipase levels were normal. Six months later, he experienced intractable abdominal pain. Serum amylase and lipase levels were elevated markedly. Abdominal computed tomography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography confirmed acute pancreatitis, with evidence of coexisting chronic pancreatitis. His funduscopic examination after the development of acute pancreatitis was improved, with almost complete resolution of retinal whitening and hemorrhages. Visual acuity remained poor because of retinal ischemia.Purtscher's retinopathy can be associated with chronic pancreatitis and can precede the development of fulminant acute pancreatitis.
