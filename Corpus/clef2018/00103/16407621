Acute pancreatitis associated with brucellosis. Acute pancreatitis can be caused by a variety of infectious agents but it is regarded as an extremely rare complication of brucellosis.We briefly describe a 56-year-old man who presented with acute pancreatitis, fever, myalgia, and other clinical symptoms. Brucella melitensis was cultured from his blood. All clinical manifestations gradually resolved with the institution of intramuscular streptomycin and oral doxycycline therapy.Acute pancreatitis may rarely be a complication of infection with B. melitensis. In areas where brucellosis is endemic, it should be kept in mind that acute pancreatitis may result from infection with brucella organisms.
