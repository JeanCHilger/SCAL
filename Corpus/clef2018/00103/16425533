Hematological-biochemical tests in patient with migraine. Migraine is periodical disorder which is characterized by recurrent headache seizures different in intensity, frequency and duration. Amylases L-1,4 glycol: gluckanohidrolises, (EC.3.2.1.1) are enzymes from hydrolase's group which dissolve starch meaning glycogen. Activity of amylases in serum grows: at acute pancreatitis, at carcinoma of pancreas, heavy necroses of pancreas. Total number of examinees was 92 out of which 45 were male (48.9 %) and 47 female or 51.1 %. Average age of the examines was 42.9. Neuroticism scale which was tested by Cornell scale was 55,03. Out of the total number of examinees 30 or 32,6 were non-smokers while 62 or 67,4 % smoked regularly. The aim of this work is to perform hematological-biochemical test of blood in patients with migraine. In the beginning of this research it was planned for all the patients to have hematological blood test done (sedimentation of erythrocytes, trombocytes, complete blood test and differential blood test) and biochemical blood test (hepatogram, transamynase, amylase, Lactal dehydrogenase, Alkalic phosphatase, ferrum in serum, Glucose, Cholesterol, Calcium and Phosphorus in serum. After reviewing the received values of hematological and biochemical tests, all values were within the borders of normal values. Amylases had higher values at 49 or 53,3 % of patients, and 43 or 46,7 % of patients had normal values of amylases. Normal values of amylases are to 220 U/l measured by I.F.C. at 37 degrees C. Medium value in tested group is 219.09. It means that every second examinee had increased values of amylase in blood there is no statistics difference of amylase value between sexes.
