Early bacterial infection of the pancreas and course of disease in cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in rats. Bacterial infection of the pancreas aggravates the course of acute pancreatitis. Since bacterial translocation from the gut is likely to be an early event, in an animal model of pancreatitis, we investigated the effect of early bacterial supra-infection of the pancreas on the course of the disease.Six hours after the induction of acute pancreatitis in male Wistar rats (n = 180) by supramaximal stimulation with cerulein (or placebo in a control group), the animals were operated and a suspension of Helicobacter pylori, Escherichia coli or saline were introduced either in the pancreatic duct or interstitium (12 groups of 15 rats each) after 24 h, animals were killed and the following parameters analysed: macroscopic and histologic appearance of the pancreas (score), wet-to-dry weight ratio, pancreas trypsinogen activation peptide level, serum amylase, interleukin-6 and phospholipase A2 activity.All parameters were increased in rats with cerulein-induced pancreatitis in comparison to placebo. Interstitial and intraductal application of bacteria increased the pancreatic damage. This effect was more evident with the application of E. coli in both cerulein and placebo groups. Application of E. coli but not of H. pylori determined pancreatic activation of trypsinogen, increased mortality and induced the production of interleukin-6.Bacterial invasion of the pancreas worsens the histologic and clinical picture of disease and induces a systemic inflammatory response.
