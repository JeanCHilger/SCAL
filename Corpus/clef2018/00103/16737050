Pancreatic duct ascariasis: sonographic diagnosis--a case report. We report the case of a 19-year old boy presenting in the emergency with severe epigastric pain whose biochemical tests revealed elevated serum amylase and lipase levels and a clinical diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was made. On ultrasonic examination, the pancreas appeared bulky with a linear tubular echogenic worm (ascaris) seen within the prominent main pancreatic duct. Successful removal of the pancreatic duct worm was achieved through endoscopic retrograde cholangio pancreatography (ERCP).
