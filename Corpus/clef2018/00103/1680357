Acute pancreatitis caused by salazopyrine. An unusual association. A 28 year old patient with a moderate attack of ulcerative colitis was treated with sulfasalazine. Ten days after, the patient was admitted with clinical and laboratory symptoms of acute pancreatitis (serum amylase 631 u., serum lipase 1080 u. urine amylase, 910 u.). Upon recovery, sulfasalazine was reintroduced at lower dosage (2 Gm/day), and the patient repeated the clinical and biological picture of acute pancreatitis (serum amylase of 710 and lipase 1010 u.) CAT scan showed pancreatic edema and ultrasonography demonstrated a normal gallbladder. The symptoms and laboratory abnormalities disappeared in three days after stopping sulfasalazine. The patient has been followed-up for one year without recurrence of pancreatitis on maintenance treatment with 1.5 Gm 5-Aminosalicylic acid.
