Evaluation of tests of exocrine and endocrine pancreatic function in older patients with cystic fibrosis. In order to determine the value of noninvasive tests in the analysis of pancreatic function in cystic fibrosis, 14 older cystic fibrosis patients were studied by a set of noninvasive tests of exocrine and endocrine pancreatic function. The tests, comprising trypsin, total amylase, pancreatic isoamylase, lipase, pancreatic polypeptide (PP), glucose and insulin in fasting serum, PP, glucose and insulin in postprandial serum, and p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) excretion in urine, were compared to fecal fat excretion after discontinuation of pancreatic enzyme supplementation. Eleven of the 14 patients were found to have a fecal fat excretion of more than 7 g/day. Serum levels of trypsin, pancreatic isoamylase and lipase, and the urinary excretion of PABA showed significant negative correlations with fecal fat excretion. Endocrine pancreatic function was abnormal in the majority of patients with fibrocystic disease. Although serum trypsin, postprandial PP, and urinary PABA excretion were the most sensitive tests for severe exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, the differences in sensitivity were rather modest. Therefore, the type of test to be selected for clinical use is mainly dependent upon factors as accessibility, simplicity, patient's acceptability, and costs.
