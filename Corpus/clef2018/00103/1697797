Combined diagnostic value of biochemical markers in acute pancreatitis. Eighty-three patients suffering from upper abdominal pain were studied to evaluate the contribution of commonly used biochemical markers in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. On admission to hospital, serum amylase, lipase, total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase activities were measured. By stepwise logistic discrimination, only two determinations appeared to be of clinical value: lipase and alkaline phosphatase activities. A classification rule was established including these two measurements and its diagnostic performance evaluated by a jackknifed method amounted .83%. ROC curves were used to assess sensitivity and specificity. Our study clearly shows that serum lipase measurements should be preferred to amylase measurements, and that our two-test classification rule provides an efficient aid in clinical decision-making.
