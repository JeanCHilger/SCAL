Acute pancreatitis--30 years' experience at a teaching hospital. Advances in medical technology and knowledge have influenced morbidity and mortality in surgically treated diseases. The authors have compiled four consecutive retrospective studies of demography, morbidity and mortality of patients with acute pancreatitis to summarize the experience from 1956 to 1985 at the Montreal General Hospital with 629 patients. The death rate has remained unchanged. Hypotension, gastrointestinal bleeding and respiratory failure have assumed lesser roles as major complicating factors. Renal failure and gram-negative aerobic pancreatic sepsis are the common causes of death. The last two reviews revealed that surgical debridement and drainage combined with appropriate biliary procedures salvaged two-thirds of the patients with sepsis. Deteriorating nutritional status, heralded by a fall of serum albumin level below 30 g/L, is associated with a poor prognosis. Interval cholecystectomy in patients with mild biliary tract pancreatitis is associated with a low death rate (0.01%).
