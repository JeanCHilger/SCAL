The effect of microtubule stabilizer on rat caerulein-induced pancreatitis. Inhibition of pancreatic digestive enzyme secretion in the acinar cell is a significant phenomenon which can trigger acute pancreatitis. It has been shown that microtubules are responsible for the intracellular vesicular transport. The effect of taxol, a microtubule stabilizer, was examined in a model of acute edematous pancreatitis induced in rats by supramaximal stimulation with cholecystokinin analogue, caerulein. Prophylactic administration of taxol ameliorated inhibition of pancreatic digestive enzyme secretion, increased level of serum amylase, pancreatic edema, and histological alterations in this model. Immunofluorescence studies revealed that taxol stabilized the arrangement of microtubules by promoting tubulin polymerization. On the other hand, microtubule disorganization was found in rats without prophylactic taxol treatment. In caerulein-treated rats, there is microtubule disorganization which causes interference with intracellular vesicular transport leading to inhibition of pancreatic digestive enzyme secretion--a forerunner of acute pancreatitis. Taxol was found to prevent these events.
