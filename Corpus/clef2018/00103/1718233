Changes of parotid gland in rat caerulein-induced acute pancreatitis: study on in vitro system. To explore the relationship between exocrine pancreas and parotid gland, we measured the changes of parotid gland in in-vitro system at an acute pancreatitis induced by supramaximal dose of caerulein (5 micrograms/kg/h for 3.5 hours) in rats. Both the serum amylase levels and parotid gland amylase content in rats with acute pancreatitis increased significantly compared with normal rats. The dry/wet weight ratio also decreased significantly and LDH discharge from parotid acini as well as lysosomal enzyme leakage from lysosomes in acini increased significantly compared with normal rats. In addition, redistribution of lysosomal enzyme in parotid acini was seen in acute pancreatitis. These results indicate the edema and congestion of amylase in parotid gland, and furthermore the increased cellular and lysosomal fragility of parotid gland at an acute pancreatitis. Thus, there seems to be the intimate organ relationship between exocrine pancreas and parotid gland as well as the important roles of gut hormones such as caerulein in the pathophysiology of parotid gland.
