Metabolic structures of the blood serum--markers of acute pancreatitis. The goal of the study was to reveal the meaning of metabolic structures of the blood serum (BS) in the diagnostics of acute pancreatitis (AP). Along with standard methods of examination, cystalloscopical examination of the BS was conducted for 46 patients with AP. The BS of 22 healthy people was used as control. In this group, the structure of BS had a form of threadlike bipalmate crystals. Metabolic structures of BS in patients with AP were characterized by signs of enzymatic dysfunctions: hyperamylasemia was presented in the form of subparallel lamellae, hypertrypsinaemia - in the form of a dendritic grid, hyperlipasaemia--in the form of bubble chambers with branches. Hyperhistaminemia was characterized by the presence of optically active feathered spherolithes, hyperserotonemia--by plateau dendritic aggregates, and markers of hyperelastasaemia were aggregates of rectangular and prismatic crystals. Hyperimmunoglobulinaemia M was characterized by skeleton cruciform crystals, and hyperimmunoglobulinaemia G--by skeleton crystals branching from the main axis at an acute angle. The optically active dendrite-like crystals were revealed at hypercreatinemia, and selective structures of BS were found at dysproteinaemia, hypersyalaemia, hyperdophaminaemia, hyper-beta-endorphinaemia, hyperacetylcholinaemia and hypertryglyceridaemia. The revealed microtypes can be used for the visual diagnostics of metabolic disorders at AP and for control over the treatment efficacy.
