Potential of adipocytokines in predicting peripancreatic necrosis and severity in acute pancreatitis: pilot study. Severe acute pancreatitis is characterized by lipase-induced peripancreatic fat cell necrosis. Because adipocytes secret several highly active molecules, the aim of the present study was to investigate the hypothesis that adipocytokines could serve as potential markers predicting peripancreatic necrosis and severity in acute pancreatitis.A total of 23 patients (11 females, 12 males) with acute pancreatitis were included and a computed tomography (CT) examination was available in 20 patients. Balthazar score, Schröder score, pancreatic necrosis score, Ranson score and APACHE II score were calculated, correlated with biochemical parameters and analyzed using receiver-operator characteristics (ROC) analysis. Adipocytokine serum levels were measured daily by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) over 10 days after admission.Resistin and leptin were significantly elevated in patients with severe pancreatitis and were correlated with a radiological scoring system for extrapancreatic necrosis. Whereas resistin correlated positively with clinical scoring systems, time until discharge and the need for interventions, leptin was correlated positively with C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Resistin levels measured on the day of admittance had a positive predictive value of 93.3% (cut-off: >6.95 ng/mL) in predicting a Schröder score >3.Resistin, and to a lesser extent leptin, but not adiponectin levels are novel potential markers for extrapancreatic necrosis and severity of acute pancreatitis and should therefore be tested in larger cohorts of patients.
