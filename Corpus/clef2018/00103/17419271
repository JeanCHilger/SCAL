The role of octreotide versus placebo in the prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis. To evaluate the effectiveness of a single administration of intravenous octreotide infusion in preventing post-ERCP pancreatitis and progressing hyperamylasemia.One hundred and twenty (71 female, 59 male) patients who had been diagnosed with pancreaticobiliary pathology were included in this study. 100 microgram (0.1 mg) octreotide diluted in 60 mL normal saline solution administered intravenously 60 minutes prior to the procedure and continued during the procedure and after the procedure. Placebo was given in 87 patients. Patients were assessed clinically and serum amylase level was also measured before the procedure and 3, 12, and 24 hours after the procedure. We define clinical pancreatitis as serum amylase level greater than 4-5 times in conjunction with clinical assessment.Hyperamylasemia was assessed in 14 of 33 (42.4%) administered octreotide patients. Clinical findings of pancreatitis were observed in 5 of these 14 (11.5%) patients. Hyperamylasemia was also assessed in 41 of 87 (47.1%) administered placebo patients. Clinical findings of pancreatitis were observed in 10 of these 41 (11.5) patients. There were no significant differences between the groups, statistically (p > 0.05) (Pearson chi-square test).The results of this trial indicate that a single administration of intravenous octreotide infusion does not prevent ERCP-induced pancreatitis and effect serum amylase level.
