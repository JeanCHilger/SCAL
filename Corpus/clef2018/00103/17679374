Utility of amylase serum and urine activity in acute biliary pancreatitis treated with biliary sphincterotomy. Although serum and urine activity assessment is a widely accepted and useful method of acute pancreatitis diagnosing and monitoring as well as patients after ERCP/ES monitoring, methods of this assessments are still debatable. The aim of this study was to assess utility of simultaneous serum and urine amylase assessment after endoscopic cholangiopancreatography with endoscopic sphincterotomy in patients with acute biliary pancreatitis.Prospective study was performed in 230 cases where procedure was succesfully performed planned assessment was performed. Patients were divided into three groups on the basis of period between hospitalization and procedure. Systematic monitoring was implemented and serum and urine amylase activity was assessed on timed basis before the procedure and seven days after the procedure or up to the amylase level normalization.Normalization and decrease of the serum and urine amylase activity was noted within few days after the procedure in all groups. Statisctically there was no significant differences among analyzed groups. Correlation coefficients were high for urine and serum amylase activity tests in all groups. Prediction of the outcome possibility in serum amylase activity on the basis of urine amylase activity and vice-versa. Generally relation between activity is as follows: Am = -0.0029 x As2 + 8 x As + 190, where Am and As are the serum and urine activity.Activity serum and urine assessment brings the same data so the simultaneous serum and urine amylase activity is not useful.
