Resistin-- a new laboratory marker useful in diagnosis of acute pancreatitis?. Acute pancreatitis (AP) is the severe disease with high mortality and morbidity which pathomechanism is still not clearly elucidated yet. Serum pro-inflammatory cytokines like Interleukin-18, TNF alpha, and C-reactive protein (CRP) are elevated in patients with AP, particularly of severe clinical course. Adipocytes hyperplasia is a trigger factor that initiates chronic inflammatory state which release adipocytokines, like TNF alpha or leptin or resistin. The aim of the present study was to assesses the serum resistin concentrations in AP patients and evaluate the correlation between resistin and the well known inflammation marker--CRP.The study group comprised 30 patients with acute pancreatitis class B according to Balthazar scale, aged 35-82, in which during first 24h of hospitalization serum resistin and CRP has been assessed. Control group consisted of 30 healthy volunteers, aged 33-76.The mean serum resistin concentration was significantly higher in AP patients than in controls (8,38 +/- 4.87 ng/ml vs. 3.58 +/- 1.51 ng/ml) (fig. 1). The positive correlation between serum resistin and CRP concentrations has been observed (r = 0.57, p < 0.05) (fig. 2).The results of our study suggest, that the serum concentration of resistin may represent the useful additionary marker of inflammatory response in AP
