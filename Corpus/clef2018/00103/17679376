Credibility of diagnostic methods in pathology of pancreas. Despite a dynamic development of new diagnostic techniques (USG, CT) pancreas pathology is still difficult. The aim of this study was to estimate the usefulness and credibility of generally available diagnostic methods that are used to differentiate between chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma.The study was based on medical documentation of 170 patients aged 21 to 88 years old (average 54.5), who were treated for pancreatic diseases in the Department of Gastroenterology and Internal Medicine of 5th Military Hospital in Cracow from the year 2000 to 2006. All of them had made biochemical tests and abdominal USG, most of them CT and tumor markers, 32 patients fine-needle aspiration biopsy.Computed tomography was recognized to be the most credible technique in diagnostics of pancreas' pathology. The tumor marker Ca19,9 was the most specific laboratory tests (the level of Ca19,9 was increased in 85.17% of patients). The level of cholestatic enzymes and bilirubin was increased in 80% of patients with pancreatic cancer. The levels of glucose, amylase and blood plates had a weak usability in diagnostics. Among the patients with fine-needle aspiration biopsy the pancreatic cancer was confirmed in 13 persons.Basing on the study, it was proved that computed tomography should be performed in all patients with pancreatic pathology. However, each person who is suspected of pancreatic cancer and the results of theirs tests are discordant, should be sent to hospital with endosonography.
