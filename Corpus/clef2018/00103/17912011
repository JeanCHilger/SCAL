Usefulness of technetium-99m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime-labeled leukocyte scintigraphy to detect pancreatic necrosis in patients with acute pancreatitis. Prospective comparison with Ranson, Glasgow and APACHE-II scores and serum C-reactive protein. In acute pancreatitis (AP), pancreatic necrosis (PN) is an important local complication that can be identified by means of contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT). Pancreatic leukocyte infiltration is a significant pathogenic event in the development of PN that can be detected by labeled leukocyte scintigraphy (LLS). The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of LLS with technetium-99m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime ((99m)Tc-HMPAO) to detect the presence of PN in patients with AP.Prospective cohort study of 84 patients with AP. Patients underwent LLS and the activity of images was scored on a 0-3 scale. CETC was performed to assess PN. Ranson, Glasgow and APACHE-II scores were calculated. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured. Sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), positive predictive values (PPV), negative predictive values (NPV), areas under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, likelihood ratios, odds ratios, analysis of variances between groups and correlation coefficients between tests were calculated.PN was present in 11 (13%) patients. Pancreatic labeled leukocyte uptake was present in 38 patients (45%). Sn, Sp, PPV and NPV of LLS grade 2-3 for PN diagnosis were the highest (91, 88, 53 and 98%, respectively) of all tests. Patients with LLS grade 2-3 were 71 times more likely to be at risk of PN compared to those with LLS grade 0-1. The area under ROC curve of the LLS was the largest. A significant correlation was obtained between LLS and CRP (p < 0.001).In patients with AP, LLS with (99m)Tc-HMPAO detects PN with an acceptable level of confidence and therefore could be considered an alternative technique to CECT in detecting PN.
