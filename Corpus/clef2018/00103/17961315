A case with transient increases in serum S100A8/A9 levels implying acute inflammatory responses after pancreatic islet transplantation. We investigated a patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus undergoing pancreatic islets transplantation. In this patient, we evaluated the clinical usefulness of serial measurement of serum S100A8/A9 complex levels for detecting acute inflammatory responses associated with rejection of transplanted pancreatic islets. The serum S100A8/A9 complex was a more sensitive marker for acute inflammation associated with islet transplant rejection than the serum C-reactive protein. Thus, the serial measurement of the serum S100A8/A9 complex concentration is useful for monitoring the patients with pancreatic islet transplantation.
