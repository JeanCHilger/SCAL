Melatonin as modulator of pancreatic enzyme secretion and pancreatoprotector. Melatonin, the main product of the pineal gland, is also released from the gastrointestinal endocrine-neurocrine (EE) cells. The concentrations of melatonin produced in the gut exceeds that originating from central nervous system. In spite of the presence of melatonin receptors in the pancreatic tissue little is known about the role of this indole in the pancreas. Our experimental studies have shown that exogenous melatonin, as well as this produced endogenously from its precursor L-tryptophan, strongly stimulates pancreatic amylase secretion when given intraperitoneally, or into the gut lumen. This was accompanied by significant increases of CCK plasma level. Above pancreatostimulatory effects of luminal administration of melatonin, were completely reversed by bilateral vagotomy, capsaicin deactivation of sensory nerves or pretreatment of the rats with CCK1 receptor antagonist
