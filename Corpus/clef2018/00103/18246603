Effects of thalidomide in a mouse model of cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis. Current knowledge shows that pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis is characterized by intraacinar enzyme activation and subsequent dysregulation in immune response. Interactions between leukocytes, soluble mediators such as cytokines and vascular endothelium contribute to the systemic progression of the inflammatory response, whose entity may--in the end--determine disease severity and outcome. Recently, it has been shown that TNF-[alpha] may be a novel target for the treatment of acute pancreatitis but the role of thalidomide, an immunomodulatory agent that inhibits TNF-(alpha) and angiogenesis, has not been investigated so far. The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of thalidomide in a murine model of necrotizing acute pancreatitis. Necrotizing acute pancreatitis was induced in mice by intraperitoneal injection of cerulein (hourly, x5, 50 microg/kg)
