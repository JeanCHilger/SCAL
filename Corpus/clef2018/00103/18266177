Elevated levels of the complement regulator protein CD59 in severe acute pancreatitis. Complement activation occurs in patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) and may contribute to the development of organ failure. Because a number of enzymes are released during AP that could influence the complement inhibitor CD59, the purpose of this study was to examine serum levels of CD59 in relation to severity of AP.Twelve patients with severe AP had organ failure (referred to as the grade 2 group). For each of them, we found 2-3 age-matched AP patients who served as controls (n=27). Of these, a total of 13 had mild AP (grade 0 group) and 14 severe AP without organ failure (grade 1 group). Blood samples were collected at admission and on days 1 and 3-7 post-admission. Grade 2 patients were compared with grade 0 and grade 1 patients. CD59 levels were measured by a sandwich enzyme immunoassay.At admission, median CD59 levels were significantly higher (p = 0.002) in grade 2 patients (median 104.2 ng/ml, range 26.1-186.3) than in grade 0 patients (37.3, range 30.3-75.9) and grade 1 patients (38.6, range 19.9 96.1). CD59 levels remained higher in grade 2 patients than in grade 0 and 1 patients on day 1 (p = 0.001) and days 3-7 (p = 0.002). The CD59 levels correlated significantly (p < 0.05) with C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (R = 0.40) and APACHE II scores (R = 0.32) on admission.Organ failure and severity of AP are associated with elevated serum levels of CD59.
