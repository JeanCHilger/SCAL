Impact of dehelminthization on pancreatic incretory and excretory functions in patients with psoriasis concurrent with chronic opisthorchiasis. A hundred and thirty patients, including 60 patients with psoriasis concurrent with chronic opisthorchiasis, 40 with psoriasis without helminthiasis, and 30 with chronic opisthorchiasis, and 15 healthy individuals were examined. To evaluate the pancreas, its incretory and excretory functions were studied. In patients with psoriasis concurrent with chronic opisthorchiasis, the pancreatic level of hormones and enzymes was significantly lower than those in patients with psoriasis without helminthiasis. Twelve months after dehelminthization, a follow-up of the parameters of the incretory function revealed their significant increase in 43 patients. Following dehelminthization, the excretory function in terms of amylase and lipase was significantly greater than that before dehelminthization. By taking into account steatorrhea, pancreatic excretory dysfunction showed significantly less fecal fat losses after a course of anthelminthic therapy. Malabsorption diminished in patients after anthelminthic therapy, as confirmed by increased urinary D-xylose excretion. Pancreatic proteolytic activity improved after dehelminthization, as supported by a significant increase in urinary PABA excretion. No improvement was observed in patients receiving no anthelminthic therapy on the contrary, deterioration was established in half of them. Therefore, a year after dehelminthization, helminthological cure in patients with psoriasis concurrent with chronic opisthorchiasis causes a significant improvement in pancreatic incretory and excretory functions and promotes regression of psoriatic manifestation.
