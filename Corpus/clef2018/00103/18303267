Dexamethasone affects inflammation but not trypsinogen activation in experimental acute pancreatitis. Trypsinogen activation and inflammation are early events in acute pancreatitis. This experimental study aimed to show the effects of dexamethasone on them.Cerulein and taurocholate pancreatitis were induced in 2 groups of 12 Wistar rats each. Six animals per group were injected with dexamethasone 1 h prior to the induction of acute pancreatitis. Amylase, phospholipase A2, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-10, alpha2-antiplasmin in plasma and trypsinogen activation peptide (TAP) in urine were measured in healthy rats, then 0.5 and 6 h after pancreatitis induction. A severity score based on edema, necrosis and ascites was calculated at 6 h. TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-10 were measured 0.5 h after laparotomy in a control sham-operated group of 6 rats.Inflammatory markers increased early in the course of both mild and severe acute pancreatitis and were significantly lowered by dexamethasone. The severity score was higher in taurocholate than in cerulein pancreatitis. It was significantly decreased by dexamethasone only in rats with mild pancreatitis. TAP remained unchanged in mild pancreatitis compared to healthy animals but increased late in the course of taurocholate pancreatitis. Trypsinogen activation was not affected by dexamethasone at all.Inflammation occurred earlier than the increase in urinary TAP in severe pancreatitis in rats. Dexamethasone inhibited inflammation but had no influence on TAP levels in experimental mild and severe acute pancreatitis.
