Nasogastric enteral nutrition in severe acute pancreatitis. To establish the nasogastric enteral nutrition tolerance in patients with severe acute pancreatitis.A total of 12 patients with severe acute pancreatitis (> or = 3 Ranson criteria C-reactive protein > 210 mg/dl) and adverse clinical course were included during 2006. When we verified the disease severity, nasogastric (10 F) enteral nutrition was initiated. We used a low fat semi-elemental feed (Dietgrif) in a slow infusion rate. We evaluated the enteral nutrition tolerance and the adverse events.The patient (4 women and 8 men) mean age (standard deviation) was 70 (11) years and the mean hospital stay was 86 days (range: 14-405 days). The etiology of pancreatitis was: gallstones 8, alcohol abuse one and unknown 3. All patients had medical and/or pancreatic complications. Seven had significant pancreatic necrosis detected in the abdominal computed tomography. Three patients were admitted in the critical care unit and 2 died. The nasogastric enteral nutrition was well tolerated in 8 out of 12 patients (67%) regardless of their medical or pancreatic complications. Only in 3 patients we had initially to discontinue the feeding because of ileus and total parenteral nutrition was provisionally necessary. Enteral nutrition was impossible in one patient because of duodenal stenosis.Nasogastric enteral nutrition is well tolerated in patients with severe acute pancreatitis and it is an alternative to others nutritional routes.
