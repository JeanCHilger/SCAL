Occurrence and risk factor for development of pancreatitis and asymptomatic hyperamylasemia following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography--our experiences. Chronic pancreatitis is defined as chronic inflammatory lesion of pancreatic parenchyma leading to destruction and fibrosis of exocrine pancreas. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the most sensitive and specific method for detection of morphological alterations in chronic pancreatitis. ERCP is inevitably associated to post-ERCP acute pancreatitis, as well as hyperamilasemia.This study aims to determine frequency of post-ERPC pancreatitis and asymptomatic hyperamilasemia.We have studied 160 patients who underwent ERCP in Institute of Digestive Diseases, Clinical Centre of Serbia in Belgrade. Data regarding cholecystectomy, papillotomy, peripapillary diverticulosis, Oddi's sphincter hypertension, choledoch canulation and diameter, Wirsung duct canulation, minor duodenal papilla patency, anomalies of BP junction, as well as chronic pancreatitis has been analysed and correlated with eventual development of post-ERCP pancreatitis and asymptomatic hyperamilasemia.Asymptomatic hyperamilasemia was determined in 51 subjects (31.9%), while pancreatitis has been developed in 5 patients (3.1%) subsequent to ERCP. It has been proofed that Wirsung duct canulation plays significant role in development of post-ERCP complications.Although numerous factors may potentially contribute to development of post-ERCP pancreatitis, none of them, with the exception of Wirsung duct canulation, has been determined to play significant role in development of these complications.
