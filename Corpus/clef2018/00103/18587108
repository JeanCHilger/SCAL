Pancreatic metaplasia in the gastro-achlorhydria in WTC-dfk rat, a potassium channel Kcnq1 mutant. The WTC-deafness Kyoto (dfk) rat is a new mutant characterized by deafness and abnormal, imbalanced behavior. WTC-dfk rats carry an intragenic deletion at the Kcnq1 gene KCNQ1 plays an important role in K(+) homeostasis, and the mutation of Kcnq1 causes a cardiac long QT syndrome in humans. Here, we studied stomach lesions in these WTC-dfk rats. The most characteristic pathologic feature in the stomach was the appearance of hypertrophic gastric glands in the stomach body. The hypertrophic cells had many eosinophilic granules in their cytoplasm, and these granules were stained red with Azan stain
