A new severe acute necrotizing pancreatitis model induced by L-ornithine in rats. Intraperitoneal administration of large doses of L-arginine is known to induce severe acute pancreatitis in rats. We therefore set out to determine whether metabolites of L-arginine (L-ornithine, L-citrulline, and nitric oxide) cause pancreatitis.The authors conducted an in vivo animal study.This study was conducted at a university research laboratory.Study subjects were male Wistar rats.Dose-response and time course changes of laboratory and histologic parameters of pancreatitis were determined after L-arginine, L-ornithine, L-citrulline, or sodium nitroprusside (nitric oxide donor) injection.Intraperitoneal injection of 3 g/kg L-ornithine but not L-citrulline or nitroprusside caused severe acute pancreatitis 4 to 6 g/kg L-ornithine killed the animals within hours. Serum and ascitic amylase activities were significantly increased, whereas pancreatic amylase activity was decreased after intraperitoneal injection of 3 g/kg L-ornithine. The increase in pancreatic trypsin activity (9-48 hrs) correlated with the degradation of IkappaB proteins and elevated interleukin-1beta levels. Oxidative stress in the pancreas was evident from 6 hrsWe have developed a simple, noninvasive model of acute necrotizing pancreatitis in rats by intraperitoneal injection of 3 g/kg L-ornithine. Interestingly, we found that, compared with L-arginine, L-ornithine was even more effective at inducing pancreatitis. Large doses of L-arginine produce a toxic effect on the pancreas, at least in part, through L-ornithine.
