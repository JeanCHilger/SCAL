Saline infusion through the pancreatic duct leads to changes in calcium homeostasis similar to those observed in acute pancreatitis. This work focuses on studying the early events associated with pancreatic damage after retrograde infusion through the pancreatic duct in rats. We have analyzed changes in calcium homeostasis and secretory response in pancreatic acini from rats with taurocholate-induced acute pancreatitis. Moreover, in order to test whether pancreatic duct manipulation can trigger damage inside pancreatic acinar cells, we have studied both parameters in acini from animals infused with saline. Our study demonstrates that taurocholate causes evident damage to acinar cells, impairing both calcium homeostasis and secretory response to CCK. In saline, a significant decrease in calcium cytosolic response to CCK was observed. Calcium disturbances similar to those observed in acute pancreatitis appear before secretion blockade and inflammation processes in saline treated rats. These results could be interesting since pancreatitis is associated to clinical procedures that require duct manipulation such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
