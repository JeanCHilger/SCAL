Pancreatitis in pregnant women. Regardless of the fact, that pancreatitis during pregnancy is rare this disease is characterized by high indices of maternal and perinatal mortality. Among variety of etiological and pathogenetic aspects of pregnant women's acute pancreatitis, leading role in its development belongs to bile-excreting system diseases, conditioned by physiological processes in women's organism during gestational period. Also there is a genetic theory of acute pancreatitis genesis in pregnant women, based on dislipoproteinemia development caused by lipoprotein lipase insufficiency, when severity of pancreatitis course is correlated with morphotype of this enzyme gene mutation. Chronic pancreatitis is conditioned by the same causes and can develop and recur during pregnancy and right after parturition. Diagnostics of pregnant women's pancreatitis is complicated because of limitation of the use of some methods (radiation and endoscopic). Pancreatitis clinical course does not differ from the one in nonpregnant women and is manifested by pain abdominal and dyspeptic syndromes, and also by syndromes of exocrine and endocrine pancreatic insufficiency. The main clinical feature of pregnant women's pancreatitis is high occurrence of painless forms. Approaches to treatment include pain relief disintoxication, use of pancreatic secretion blockers, multienzyme complexes, glycemia correction.
