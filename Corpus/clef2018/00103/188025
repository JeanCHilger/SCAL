Pleuresies in chronic pancreatitis and in pancreatic pseudocysts. A study apropos of 20 cases. The pleurisies rich in amylase of the chronic pancreatitis and of pancreatic pseudo-cysts, studied in 20 cases, are quite unfrequent (0.5% of pleurisies of all kinds in the medical milieu). A pseudo-cyst was found 12 times out of 20 and a chronic pancreatitis without pseudocyst was found 8 times out of 20. Pleural effusion has a definite diagnostic valve, because in 70% of cases pancreatopathy cannot be recognized before it happens. The pleural liquid is rich in proteins and haemorrhagic in 2/3 of cases and its amylasic activity is either high or very high. Amylase level in pleural liquid is usually superior to amylasemia. The injection of lipiodol in the pleural cavity enables the visualization of a transdiaphragmatic fistula but this examination is not always well tolerated. The preoperatory cystography can opacify the pleura. In the absence of pseudo-cyst, medical treatment can dry the pleurisy in 70% of cases but does not modify the evolution of the pancreatic affection which will require surgery. Where a pseudo-cyst is concerned, surgery will often and quickly be the remedy.
