Meta-analysis of prophylactic allopurinol use in post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and the safety of allopurinol in the prophylaxis of post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis.: We used the method recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration to perform a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of allopurinol in the prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP), including 6 RCTs conducted all over the world.: Six RCTs totaling 1554 patients undergoing ERCP were included. When the RCTs were analyzed, odds ratios of allopurinol were 0.74 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37-1.48 P = 0.40) for PEP, 0.87 (95% CI, 0.33-2.28: Allopurinol cannot prevent the pancreatic injury after ERCP. Allopurinol is not recommended in the prophylaxis of PEP.
