Effectivity of qualitative urinary trypsinogen-2 measurement in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis: a randomized, clinical study. There is no any definite diagnostic test for acute pancreatitis. In the present study we investigated the value of the qualitative urinary trypsinogen-2 measurement in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis by an immuno-chromatographic dipstick test.A prospective, randomized, clinical trial was planned on 99 patients (53 male, 46 female male/female : 1.11In group 1, urinary trypsinogen-2 measurement was found positive in 28 cases out of 50 cases diagnosed with acute pancreatitis (56% sensitivity). In group 2, results were found positive in 3 out of 49 patients with abdominal pain, who lacked an acute pancreatitis diagnosis (90.9% specificity). Severe intra-abdominal inflammation was present in three cases of group 2 where we obtained false positive results which may stimulate the pancreatic exocrine secretion.Qualitative measurements of urinary trypsinogen-2 in patients with abdominal pain may be useful in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. It is an easy, inexpensive, rapid and noninvasive method.
