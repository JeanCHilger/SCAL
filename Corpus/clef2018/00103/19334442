Change of nitric oxide metabolites in patients with chronic pancreatitis. 72 patients with chronic pancreatitis were investigated. The levels of nitrogen oxide in the blood and urine were examined in the patients with chronic pancreatitis depend on the disease's stage and its complications. The nitrogen oxide metabolites were determined to all patients (by method of V. A. Metelskaya, 2005) The trustworthy differences of NO levels were revealed depend on the chronic pancreatitis complications presence. The patients with the pancreatic hypertension due to pancreatic calcinosis, that was accompanied persistent painful syndrome and relativelly high blood amylase level (amylase increase 3-4 times in comparison with its normal level) were demonstrated the high NO levels. The tendency to the lowering of level NO and painful syndrome with blood amylase activity reduce were revealed in the patients with surgical treatment of the complicated chronic pancreatitis. The lowering of the painful syndrome and the blood amylase activity follow to normalisaton of pancreatic juice outflow and reduce of the inflammation in parenchyma pancreas. So, the revealed connection increase of NO level and pancreatic inflammation may be the additional criterions for the surgical treatment of such patients.
