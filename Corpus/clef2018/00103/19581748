A wayward cyst. Pseudocysts are a common complication of acute and chronic pancreatitis. These are usually located within the pancreas but they can occur at other sites as well, including the mediastinum, neck, pelvis and rarely in the liver as in our case. The diagnosis of intrahepatic pancreatic pseudocyst relies on the demonstration of a high amylase level in the sampled cystic fluid in the absence of infection or neoplasm.A 60-year-old man with a history of chronic pancreatitis presents with a clinical and laboratory picture suggestive of acute exacerbation of his pancreatitis. A computed tomogram (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed a pancreatic pseudocyst and a cystic lesion involving both lobes of the liver. CT diagnostic aspiration of the intrahepatic cyst revealed high amylase level (greater than 20,000 U/L). The cyst was treated with percutaneous drainage with complete resolution of the cyst.In the setting of pancreatitis, intrahepatic pancreatic pseudocyst should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cystic lesion of the liver.
