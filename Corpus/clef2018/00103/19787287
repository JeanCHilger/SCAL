Ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage may decrease the mortality of severe acute pancreatitis. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ultrasound-guided percutaneous catheter drainage (PCD) treatment for severe acute pancreatitis compared to conservative and conventional surgical treatments.Eighty-one patients with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) were admitted and divided into three groups: forty-nine cases in the conservative therapy group nineteen cases in the surgery groupFour patients (8.2%) in the conservative therapy group died, five patients (31.3%) in surgery group with a CTSI > 8.0 died, and all patients in the PCD group survived. The mortality rate was lower in the PCD group than in the surgery group (P = 0.048). The serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level recovered more quickly in patients in the PCD group compared to those in the surgery group (P < 0.001).Patients with SAP and a CTSI < or = 8.0 could be treated with conservative therapy, while patients with a CTSI > 8.0 should be treated with surgery or PCD therapy if the life-threatening complications of extensive fluid collection or necrosis are a factor. However, PCD therapy used in a timely manner for drainage may decrease mortality in patients with SAP, decrease inflammatory mediator release, and avoid incidence of severe sepsis or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and emergency surgery.
