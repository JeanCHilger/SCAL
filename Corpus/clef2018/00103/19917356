Ductal injection of University of Wisconsin solution prior to pancreas preservation prevents oxidative cell damage. Several studies have been carried out investigating different preservation methods and preservation solutions for the pancreata of various species. Attention has to be drawn to the extreme vulnerability of porcine pancreata (PP) to oxidative stress due to the lack of endogenous antioxidants. This study sought to evaluate the influence of cannulation and infusion of different volumes of University of Wisconsin (UW) solution immediately after organ retrieval on PP organ quality.PP from 24 slaughterhouse pigs were harvested with immediate cannulation of the pancreatic duct for infusion of 10 mL, 20 mL, 50 mL, or 100 mL UW solution. The organs were stored in cold UW solution. Control organs were only stored in UW. After 6 hours of cold ischemia, tissue and supernate samples were analyzed for markers of oxidative cell damage, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, and occurrence of apoptosis.The fewest apoptotic cells were detected in the PP infused with 50 mL UW via the pancreatic duct (PP 50) as compared with all other groups. Oxidative cell damage was lowest and ATP levels were highest in the PP 50 group.Because PP 50 showed significantly better results when compared with all other groups, we suggest that infusion of 50 mL UW via the pancreatic duct immediately after organ retrieval may be useful to minimize oxidative cell damage and cell death in PP.
