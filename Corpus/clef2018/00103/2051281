Pancreatitis with hypoglycemia-associated convulsions following rotavirus gastroenteritis. A case of acute pancreatitis and hypoglycemia-associated convulsions following rotavirus gastroenteritis, occurring in a previously healthy 2-year, 8-month-old girl, is reported. Rotavirus infection was demonstrated both by detection of virus particles in stools by electron microscopy and Rotazyme Abbott, and by detection of specific serum IgM and IgG antibodies. Pancreatitis was revealed by raised serum amylase and lipase levels and by ultrasonographic findings. Moreover, transient islet cell antibodies were found. No abnormalities were revealed by clinical and laboratory follow-up studies. As suggested by this case report, further investigations on the possible pancreatic involvement by rotavirus may be helpful.
