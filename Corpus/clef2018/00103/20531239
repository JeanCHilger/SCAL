Ameliorative effect of adalimumab on experimentally induced acute pancreatitis in rats. In this study, the effects of adalimumab (ADA), a fully humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody to tumor necrosis factor α, on experimentally acute pancreatitis (AP) were examined.Healthy Wistar rats (n = 32) were randomly divided into 4 groups: group 1, AP group 2, AP + ADAAdalimumab treatment significantly decreased serum amylase activity (AP, 2778.25 ± 298.80 AP + ADA, 2143.13 ± 221.69These results support the idea that adalimumab might be beneficial for severity of AP.
