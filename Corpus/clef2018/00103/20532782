Contrast-enhanced ultrasound in the staging of acute pancreatitis. To determine the diagnostic value of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in the assessment of acute pancreatitis, with computed tomography (CT) as the reference standard.Fifty consecutive patients (mean age 58.4 years range 23-86 years) with acute pancreatitis underwent prospectively both CT and ultrasonography, including CEUS, within a 24-h interval. Pancreatic vascularisation was evaluated with CEUS after injection of a second-generation US contrast-enhancing agent. Acute pancreatitis severity was graded according to the Balthazar index. The results were compared with CT severity index and clinical outcome by using Spearman's correlation coefficient.A significant correlation between CT and CEUS was found for the CT severity index (r = 0.926), extent of necrosis (r = 0.893) and Balthazar grade (r = 0.884). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for detecting severe acute pancreatitis based on CT findings (severity index greater than 3 and/or presence of necrosis) were respectively 91%, 100%, 100% and 83%. A significant correlation between CEUS severity index and clinical variables was found: Ranson score (r = 0.442), C-reactive protein (CRP) levels 48 h after admission (r = 0.385) and length of hospital stay (r = 0.362).CEUS is comparable to CT in detecting pancreatic necrosis as well as predicting its clinical course. Therefore, when CT is contraindicated CEUS may be a valid alternative.
