A case of acute pancreatitis after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy for renal pelvic calculus. A 62-year-old man was admitted to receive extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) for a right renal pelvic calculus. During the operation, the patient complained of right upper quadrant pain. Later in the day, laboratory data showed elevated serum amylase levels, and abdominal CT revealed an enlarged pancreas. These findings led to a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. The following day, urine output had decreased, and pleural and ascitic fluid had accumulated. For these reasons, the patient was transferred to our hospital to receive combination therapy, including arterial infusion therapy with protease inhibitors, antibiotics and continuous hemodiafiltration. The condition of the patient improved, and he was discharged on day 30. Acute pancreatitis should be considered as an early complication after ESWL for urinary tract calculus.
