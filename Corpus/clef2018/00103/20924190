Effect of mycophenolate mofetil on cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) on acute pancreatitis with evaluation of biochemical and histopathological findings.Cerulein was administered to induce acute pancreatitis in rats. Three groups of 10 rats each were formed. Animals in group 1 received physiologic saline solution. In group 2 animals received MMF at a dose of 14 mg/kg and group 3 had double doses of MMF. Alanine aminostransferase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), amylase and bilirubin levels were assessed. Pancreatic tissues were evaluated under light microscopy for the presence of edema, acinar necrosis, hemorrhage, inflammation and perivascular infiltration.Amylase, serum AST, edema and inflammatory infiltration levels differed between groups (amylase: p = 0.0001, serum AST: p = 0.001, edema: p = 0.0001 and inflammatory infiltration: p = 0.002), group 1 showing the highest amylase, serum AST and edema levels. The lowest levels of edema were found in group 3.In an experimental pancreatitis model in rats, MMF proved to exert a beneficial effect on biochemical and histopathological parameters.
