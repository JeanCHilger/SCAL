Necrotic acute pancreatitis in the intensive care unit: a comparison between conservative and surgical medical treatment. To determine the prognosis of patients with necrotic acute pancreatitis receiving medical and surgical treatments.The severe acute pancreatitis treatment is multidisciplinary and requires a daily evaluation of the patient that will allow to observe changes and apply therapy in due time. The treatment includes: Admission in the ICU, fluids, nutrition and antibiotics, as well as other life supports for high-risk patients. Thus, patients undergo conservative treatment or, if it is necessary, surgery.A retrospective study of patients with necrotic acute pancreatitis admitted to the ICU between January 2004 and August 2006. The patients with necrotic acute pancreatitis without signs of sepsis underwent a conservative medical treatment, while fine needle punction-aspiration was performed in all patients who were suffering from necrotic acute pancreatitis and persistent sepsis four weeks after their admission and after discarding and eradicating every non-pancreatic focus of infection. All Gram stain or culture positive patients underwent surgery immediately.Seventy patients with necrotic acute pancreatitis were included in the study. Thirty-six patients (51%) suffered acute pancreatitis with sterile necrosis and underwent a conservative treatment, while 34 patients (49%) developed acute pancreatic with infected necrosis and underwent surgery. The average age was 55.19 vs. 57.65 (p=0.57). The average amylase was 1421.74 vs. 1402.45. (p=0.96). The tomography severity index was 8.47 vs. 8.79 (p=0.36). The Apache II was 8.22 vs. 9 (p=0.46). The average number of failed organs was 0.39 vs. 0.68. (p=0.19). The ICU stay was 10.75 vs. 26.5 days (p<0.05) while the total hospital stay was 46.47 vs. 57.26 days (p<0.05). The mortality rate was (3/36) 8.3% vs. (9/34) 26.5% (p<0.05) for conservative medical treatment vs. surgical treatment, respectively. Between the first and the twelfth month the evaluated patients who attended consultation, after discharge, showed: pancreatic pseudocyst 9/36 (25%) vs. 8/34(23.5%) recurring abdominal pain 3/36 (8.3%) vs. 4/34 (11.8%)Patients suffering acute pancreatitis with sterile necrosis can undergo conservative medical treatment which will result in a lower mortality rate, while the hospital stay, in comparison with acute pancreatitis with infected necrosis, will not be affected.
