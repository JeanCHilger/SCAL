Hyperlipidemic versus healthy pancreases: a proteomic analysis using an animal model. Hyperlipidemia is associated with a variety of pancreatic diseases however, the underlying pathophysiology and molecular mechanisms remain undefined. Here, we performed a comparative proteomic analysis of pancreatic tissue obtained from hyperlipidemic rats to identify proteins that may be involved in mediating hyperlipidemia-associated pancreatic injury. Rats were fed a high-fat diet to induce hyperlipidemia. Control rats were fed a diet with normal fat content. Pancreatic tissue samples were obtained after 6 or 12 weeks and comparative proteomic analysis, using gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, was conducted to identify proteins, the expression of which were altered in pancreases from hyperlipidemic compared with control rat pancreases. The expression levels of 3 of 13 proteins were significantly altered in pancreatic samples from hyperlipidemic rats. Alpha-amylase and arginase II were dysregulated by more than twofold. These modulations persisted in pancreatic tissue obtained from late-stage hyperlipidemic rats. The levels of alpha-amylase and arginase II were significantly altered in pancreases obtained from rats with hyperlipidemia. These enzymes may be putative biomarkers of hyperlipidemia-mediated pancreatic injury.
