The endoscopic treatment of large calculi in the choledochus. The preliminary results with intracorporeal electrohydraulic shock-wave lithotripsy. Results are reported of endoscopic treatment of: 236 patients with common bile duct calculi treated by endoscopic sphincterotomy with or without hydrostatic balloon extraction and extraction of the calculi, mechanical lithotripsy and endoprosthesis preliminary results in 12 patients treated by intracorporeal electrohydraulic lithotripsy. Complete removal of calculi from the common bile duct was achieved in 171 of 236 sphincterotomized patients (72 per cent). Complications were observed in 11 per cent of the patients. Mechanical cracking of common bile duct calculi was realized in 60 of 65 patients (92 per cent) with complications observed in 3 per cent. Thus, with the use of mechanical lithotripsy the success of endoscopic treatment rose to 98 per cent, without increase in the incidence of complications. Seven patients had endoprostheses placed because of failure to extract the calculi. Intracorporeal electrohydraulic lithotripsy was performed in 12 patients with common bile duct lithiasis (4 with single and 8 with numerous stones with diameter 20-40 mm. In one patient transient acute pancreatitis was observed. A rise in serum amylase content was recorded in 9 patients. The stones in the common bile duct were effectively broken to pieces and removed in 8 patients. Lithotripsy was unsuccessful in 4 patients, two of whom had solid calcium depositions. In the common bile duct of the other two MTBE gas applied. The patients were subjected to repeated lithotripsy with positive effect. It is pointed out in conclusion that crushing stones in the common bile duct allows real improvement of the results of endoscopic sphincterotomy in common bile duct calculosis. Endoscopic treatment of larger calculi became also feasible which until a few years ago were contraindication for endoscopic treatment.
