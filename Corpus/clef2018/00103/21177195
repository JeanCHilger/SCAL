Protective effects of captopril against lung injury in rats with severe acute pancreatitis. To investigate the protective effects of captopril against lung injury in a rat model of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP).Seventy-two male SD rats were randomized into sham-operated group (SO group), SAP group and captopril intervention group (CAP group). Serum amylase and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in the lung tissue were examined at 1, 6 and 12 h after the operation. TNF-α and AngII in the lung tissue were detected by ELISA, and the histopathological changes of the pancreas and lung were observed microscopically.The MPO activity , which was similar between SAP group and CAP group at 1 h, were significantly lowered in CAP group at 6 and 12 h (P<0.05). Serum amylase level and the levels of TNF-α and AngII in the lung tissue homogenate were all reduced significantly in CAP group as compared to those in SAP group (P<0.01). The pathological injury of the lung was obviously lessened in CAP group in comparison with that in SAP group.Captopril can ameliorate SAP-induced lung injury in rats.
