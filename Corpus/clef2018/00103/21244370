Lymphocyte function antigen-1 regulates neutrophil recruitment and tissue damage in acute pancreatitis. Leucocyte infiltration is a rate-limiting step in the pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis (AP) although the adhesive mechanisms supporting leucocyte-endothelium interactions in the pancreas remain elusive. The aim of this study was to define the role of lymphocyte function antigen-1 (LFA-1) in regulating neutrophil-endothelium interactions and tissue damage in severe AP.Pancreatitis was induced by retrograde infusion of sodium taurocholate into the pancreatic duct in mice. LFA-1 gene-targeted mice and an antibody directed against LFA-1 were used to define the role of LFA-1.Taurocholate challenge caused a clear-cut increase in serum amylase, neutrophil infiltration, CXCL2 (macrophage inflammatory protein-2) formation, trypsinogen activation and tissue damage in the pancreas. Inhibition of LFA-1 function markedly reduced taurocholate-induced amylase levels, accumulation of neutrophils, production of CXC chemokines and tissue damage in the pancreas. Notably, intravital microscopy revealed that inhibition of LFA-1 abolished taurocholate-induced leucocyte adhesion in postcapillary venules of the pancreas. In addition, pulmonary infiltration of neutrophils was attenuated by inhibition of LFA-1 in mice challenged with taurocholate. However, interference with LFA-1 had no effect on taurocholate-induced activation of trypsinogen in the pancreas.Our novel data suggest that LFA-1 plays a key role in regulating neutrophil recruitment, CXCL2 formation and tissue injury in the pancreas. Moreover, these results suggest that LFA-1-mediated inflammation is a downstream component of trypsinogen activation in the pathophysiology of AP. Thus, we conclude that targeting LFA-1 may be a useful approach to protect against pathological inflammation in the pancreas.
