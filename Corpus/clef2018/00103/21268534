The role of calprotectin and ghrelin in diagnosis of post ERCP pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis is a common and dreaded complication of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) patients. The study identified the incidence of post ERCP pancreatitis and role of serum calprotectin and ghrelin in its diagnosis. One hundred forty two patients underwent ERCP-related procedures were studied. Serum amylase, lipase, calprotectin and ghrelin concentrations were measured 24 hours after the procedure using ELISA, kinetic and colorimetric methods. Thirty two healthy controls were enrolled. In post ERCP group, mean level of amylase was 146.03 +/- 57.40 U/L, lipase 328.37 +/- 133.95 U/L, calprotectin 3.26 +/- 2.99 U/L and gherkin 2.56 +/- 1.76 mg/l. In controls mean level of amylase was 58.13 +/- 15.96U/L, lipase 181.63 +/- 51.94 U/L, calprotectin 0.49 +/- 0.17 U/L and ghrelin 2.59 +/- 0.19 mg/l. A statistical significant increase was reported (p < 0.001) in levels of amylase, lipase and calprotectin between the two groups without significant in ghrelin level.
