Anti-inflammatory effect of α,β-amyrin, a triterpene from Protium heptaphyllum, on cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in mice. To evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of α,β-amyrin, a pentacyclic triterpenoid from Protium heptaphyllum, on cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in mice.Acute pancreatitis was induced in Swiss mice by five intraperitoneal injections of cerulein (50 μg/kg), at 1 h intervals. Mice received α,β-amyrin (10, 30 and 100 mg/kg), thalidomide (200 mg/kg), or vehicle (3% Tween 80) orally 1 h before and 12 h after the cerulein challenge. The severity of pancreatitis was evaluated 24 h after cerulein by assessing serum pro-inflammatory cytokines and amylase activity, pancreatic myeloperoxidase (MPO), and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), as well as by histology.α,β-Amyrin and thalidomide significantly attenuated the cerulein-induced increase in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin-6, lipase, amylase, MPO, and TBARS. Moreover, α,β-amyrin greatly suppressed the pancreatic edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, acinar cell necrosis, and expressions of TNFα and inducible nitric oxide synthase.α,β-Amyrin ameliorates cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis by acting as an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agent.
