Eosinophilia as an early indicator of pancreatic allograft rejection. Monitoring pancreas transplant recipients for rejection is an inexact science. Serial monitoring of urinary amylase has been used for patients with a bladder-drained pancreas. An increase in serum amylase and lipase has been utilized as an in vivo measure of pancreas rejection in patients with enteric pancreatic exocrine drainage. Decreases in urinary amylase or increases in serum amylase or lipase, respectively, in these two different types of surgical drainage would prompt a pancreas biopsy for histologic confirmation of rejection. Herein, we describe the case of an enteric-drained pancreatic transplant recipient who presented with peripheral eosinophilia at least one month before she developed increases in serum amylase and lipase. A pancreas allograft biopsy indicated eosinophilic acute cellular rejection. Peripheral eosinophilia may be a useful early indicator of pancreas graft rejection preceding changes in serum pancreatic enzymes by approximately one month.
