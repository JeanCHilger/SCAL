Melittin inhibits cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis via inhibition of the JNK pathway. The major compound of bee venom, melittin, has been used as an anti-inflammatory reagent for decades. However, the potential of melittin to ameliorate acute pancreatitis (AP) is unknown. Our aim was to investigate the effect of melittin on cerulein-induced AP. Pre- and post-treatment with melittin inhibited histological changes in the pancreas and lungs during cerulein-induced AP.
