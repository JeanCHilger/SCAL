Beneficial effects of alpha lipoic acid on cerulein-induced experimental acute pancreatitis in rats. The present study aimed to determine the effects of alpha lipoic acid (ALA) on blood and tissue biochemical parameters, as well as tissue histopathology, in an experimental rat model of cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis (AP).Three groups consisting of eight rats each were used, as follows: Group 1, controls Group 2, cerulein-induced pancreatitis group treated with salineWhile plasma amylase, lipase, IL-1ß, and TNF-α levels, and tissue MDA and MPO levels significantly increased in rats with cerulean-induced AP, tissue GSH and Na+-K+-ATPase activity significantly reduced. These changes were reversed and improved with ALA treatment.Our findings suggest that ALA may significantly reduce morbidity and mortality by preventing organ dysfunction induced by free radicals in the pancreas.
