P-selectin mediates neutrophil rolling and recruitment in acute pancreatitis. The adhesive mechanisms regulating leucocyte-endothelium interactions in the pancreas remain elusive, but selectins may play a role. This study examined the molecular mechanisms mediating leucocyte rolling along the endothelium in the pancreas and the therapeutic potential of targeting the rolling adhesive interaction in acute pancreatitis (AP).Pancreatitis was induced by retrograde infusion of 5 per cent sodium taurocholate into the pancreatic duct, repeated intraperitoneal administration of caerulein (50 µg/kg) or intraperitoneal administration of L-arginine (4 g/kg) in C57BL/6 mice. A control and a monoclonal antibody against P-selectin were administered before and after induction of AP. Serum and tissue were sampled to assess the severity of pancreatitis, and intravital microscopy was used to study leucocyte rolling.Taurocholate infusion into the pancreatic duct increased the serum level of trypsinogen, trypsinogen activation, pancreatic neutrophil infiltration, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) 2 formation and tissue damage. Immunoneutralization of P-selectin decreased the taurocholate-induced increase in serum trypsinogen (median (range) 17·35 (12·20-30·00) versus 1·55 (0·60-15·70) µg/l P = 0·017), neutrophil accumulation (4·00 (0·75-4·00) versus 0·63 (0-3·25)Inhibition of P-selectin protected against pancreatic tissue injury in experimental pancreatitis. Targeting P-selectin may be an effective strategy to ameliorate inflammation in AP.
