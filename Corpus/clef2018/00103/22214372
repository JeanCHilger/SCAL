Role of heparin on serum VEGF levels and local VEGF contents in reducing the severity of experimental severe acute pancreatitis in rats. The aims of this study were to examine the effects of prophylactic heparin treatment during taurocholate-induced pancreatitis in rats and its impact on serum VEGF levels and local VEGF contents within the pancreas.Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) was induced by injecting 4% sodium taurocholate into the pancreatic duct. Heparin at a dose of 150 IU/kg s.c. was administered 30 min before the operation. The rats were sacrificed 1 h, 3 h, 6 h and 12 h (n = 5 per time point) after the onset of pancreatitis. The severity of pancreatitis, serum VEGF levels and local VEGF contents were evaluated with and without heparin pretreatment.The serum VEGF levels increased at an early phase of pancreatitis, and the highest level was found at 12 h after inducing pancreatitis. The gray value of the local VEGF showed a remarkable increase from the onset of the pancreatitis. However, the gray value of VEGF did not show an increase over time but maintained a high level during the entire process. Prophylactic heparin treatment significantly improved the morphologic changes, myeloperoxidase (MPO), TNF-Î± and malondialdehyde (MDA) activities. Meanwhile, it decreased the serum VEGF levels and the contents of VEGF within the pancreatic tissue.The present study suggests that prophylactic heparin ameliorates the severity of taurocholate-induced pancreatitis via its anti-inflammatory properties. These protective effects may be partly due to decreasing serum VEGF levels and VEGF contents within the pancreas.
