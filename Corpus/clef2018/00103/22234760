Does presence of common bile duct stones in patients with acute biliary pancreatitis affect the severity of illness or laboratory findings? To determine the effect of stone within the common bile duct, on the severity of acute biliary pancreatitis.This is a prospective and cross sectional study which was conducted at a tertiary care hospital including 103 patients. Serum biochemical values and white blood cell counts at the first 12th and 72nd hours of presentation were evaluated. The patients were grouped according to the presence or absence of common bile duct stones which were diagnosed by endoscopic ultrasonography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Besides, the patients were classified as mild and severe acute pancreatitis according to the data provided by computed tomography (Balthazar scoring) and clinical assessment and blood samples.Among the 103 patients with acute biliary patients, radial endoscopic ultrasonography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography revealed stones and/or sludge within the common bile duct or ampulla in 41 (39.8%) patients. There was not any persistent common bile duct stone in 62 (60.2%) patients. Severe pancreatitis developed in 9 (22%) of 41 patients who were determined to have stones by endoscopic ultrasonography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and in 13 (21%) of 62 patients who were not. There was no difference in the incidence of progressing to severe acute biliary patients between patients with and without common bile duct stones (p=0.45).Presence of common bile duct stones do not correlate with the severity of acute biliary pancreatitis.
