Down-regulation of aquaporin 1 in rats with experimental acute necrotizing pancreatitis. The objectives of this study were to investigate the expression of aquaporin 1 in capillary endothelial cells of rats with experimental acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP) and to explore its pathogenic role in capillary leak.Sixty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into control (n = 32) and ANP groups (n = 32). Eight rats in each group were killed at 3, 6, 12, and 18 hours after induction of experimental models. Quantity of ascites and levels of serum amylases were measured. Capillary permeability in pancreas, lung, and intestinal tissue was detected by Evans blue extravasation method. Aquaporin 1 expression in pancreas, lung, and intestinal tissue was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemical staining, and Western blot.Serum amylase level was significantly higher in ANP group than in controls (P < 0.05). Evans blue concentration in tissues in the ANP group was significantly higher than that in controls (P < 0.05). Aquaporin 1 mRNA and protein expressions in tissues were significantly less in the ANP group than in the controls (P < 0.05).The expression of aquaporin 1 was down-regulated in the pancreas, lung, and intestinal tissue of ANP rats, which could play an important role in the pathogenesis of capillary leak syndrome.
