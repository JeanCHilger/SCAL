Rapid urinary trypsinogen-2 test in the early diagnosis of acute pancreatitis: a meta-analysis. Urinary trypsinogen-2 has been implicated as a promising biomarker for the early diagnosis of acute pancreatitis (AP). The meta-analysis was used to establish the overall accuracy of urinary trypsinogen-2 test for diagnosing AP.Based on comprehensive searches of the PubMed and Embase databases, we identified and abstracted outcome data from all articles evaluating the diagnostic value of urinary trypsinogen-2. A summary estimate for sensitivity, specificity, 95% confidence region and 95% prediction region was calculated using the bivariate random-effects approach.The meta-analysis included 13 studies (2342 patients, the proportion of severe AP from 13.21% to 30.00%). Overall, the pooled sensitivity was 82.3% (95%CI 79.3%-85.1%) and specificity was 93.5% (95%CI 92.2%-94.6%). The diagnostic odds ratios (DOR) was 85.23 (95%CI 40.14-180.99). The area under the summary ROC curve (AUC) was 0.9673.The urinary trypsinogen-2 test is a reliable and rapid method for the early diagnosis of AP.
