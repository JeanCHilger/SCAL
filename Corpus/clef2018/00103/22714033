Effects of rectal indomethacin in the prevention of post-ERCP acute pancreatitis. Recently non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have seemed to reduce the frequency of post-ERCP pancreatitis in some prospective controlled trials, but the results have to be confirmed by further studies.To evaluate the efficacy of rectally administered indomethacin for the reduction of incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis.A prospective randomized placebo-controlled study was conducted in 228 patients who underwent ERCP. Patients were randomized to receive a suppository containing 100 mg indomethacin or an inert placebo 10 mins before ERCP. Patients were evaluated clinically and biochemically by using serum amylase levels measured 24 h after the procedure.Pancreatitis and hyperamylasemia occurred more frequently in the placebo group, but the difference was not significant. In respect to the rate of pancreatitis, this tendency could particularly be observed in females, in patients older than 60 years and in patients with BMI lower than 25 however, it completely failed in cases with pancreatic duct filling or in those with pancreatic EST.Rectal indomethacin given before ERCP did not prove to be statistically effective in the reduction of the incidence of post-procedure pancreatitis. Further, controlled multicenter studies are required to assess safely the potential efficacy of indomethacin in the prevention of pancreatitis following ERCP.
