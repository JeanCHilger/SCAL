Prior peritoneal lavage with hot 0.9 % saline induces HSP70 expression and protects against cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in rats. Recent studies have indicated that pre-induction of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) expression in the pancreas protects against secretagogue-induced pancreatitis. In those studies, the HSP70 was mostly induced by unfeasible conditions. The aim of this current study was to investigate the effect of peritoneal lavage with hot 0.9 % saline (42 °C) on the pancreatic expression of HSP70 and its protective effect on cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in rats. Male Wistar rats were peritoneally lavaged with 0.9 % saline at 42 °C for 30 min. HSP70 expression was evaluated by western blotting analysis. Prior peritoneal lavages with hot and warm saline were performed. Acute pancreatitis was induced by administration of intraperitoneal injection of cerulein (20 μg/kg) four times, and its severity was assessed by measuring serum amylase, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and trypsinogen activation peptide (TAP) levels. Pancreatic sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histological evaluation. Peritoneal lavage with hot 0.9 % saline increased intrapancreatic HSP70 expression and ameliorated the cerulein-induced pancreatitis in rats, judged by the significantly reduced serum amylase, TNF-α, and IL-6 concentrations histopathological scores, and serum TAP levels. Peritoneal lavage with hot 0.9 % saline can induce HSP70 expression and prevent cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in rats. The results suggest that HSP70 protects against cerulein-induced pancreatitis by preventing proinflammatory cytokine synthesis and trypsinogen activation during acute pancreatitis.
