Expression of pancreatic regenerating gene in lung and intestinal tissue             correlates with the severity of disease in rats with acute necrotizing pancreatitis. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression pattern of regenerating gene I (Reg I) in the lung and intestinal tissues of rats with acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP), as well as the correlation of Reg I expression with lung and intestinal injury. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated to control (n=40) and ANP (n=80) groups. The rats in the control group received laparotomy only. In the ANP group, 3% sodium taurocholate was injected into the pancreatic duct to develop the ANP model. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to detect the Reg I mRNA levels in the pancreas, intestine and lung. The pathological changes in the pancreas, intestine and lung were observed and the serum amylase levels, the wet/dry weight ratio of the lung and the permeability of the intestinal mucosa were measured. The measured parameters were found to correlate with the Reg I mRNA levels. Reg I mRNA was more highly expressed in the pancreas, intestine and lung in the ANP rats than in the control group. The Reg I expression levels were positively correlated with the pathological scores, serum amylase levels, lung pathological scores, lung tissue wet/dry ratios, intestinal pathological scores and intestinal permeability. The levels of Reg I were increased in the lung and intestinal tissue of the ANP rats and the expression levels of Reg I correlated closely with the severity of the lung and intestinal injury.
