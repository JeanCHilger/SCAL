Effect of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells on treatment of severe acute pancreatitis in rats. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs) on severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) in rats.SAP was established in rats by retrograde pancreatic duct injection of sodium taurocholate. In one group, 5 × 10(6) cells/kg of UCMSC suspension was injected into the tail vein 0 h, 1 h, 6 h and 12 h after the induction of SAP. In other groups, different doses of UCMSC suspension (5 × 10(4) cells/kg, 5 × 10(5) cells/kg, 5 × 10(6) cells/kg or 1 × 10(7) cells/kg) were administered at 1 h. Serum amylase was assayed at 12 h. Mortality, ascites, serum tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ (assayed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and the wet-dry weight of the pancreas gland were assessed at 48 h. Pathologic changes of pancreatic and pulmonary tissues were observed.Mortality in rats receiving 5 × 10(6) cells/kg of UCMSCs at 0 h was 10% compared with 58% in the SAP control group. Ascites, serum amylase and wet-dry pancreatic weight significantly decreased, and production of tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ were reduced. Pathologic injuries of pancreatic and pulmonary tissues were markedly alleviated. Administration of UCMSCs (5 × 10(5) cells/kg, 5 × 10(6) cells/kg or 1 × 10(7) cells/kg) at 1 h or 5 × 10(6) cells/kg at 6 h significantly reduced the severity of SAP. The effect was less marked at 12 h and with lower concentrations of UCMSCs.UCMSCs significantly decreased pancreatic injury caused by SAP in a time-dependent and dose-dependent way.
