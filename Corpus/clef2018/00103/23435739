Activation of the IL-6R/Jak/stat pathway is associated with a poor outcome in resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Chronic localized pancreatic inflammation in the form of chronic pancreatitis is an established risk factor for human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) development. Constitutive activation of inflammation-related signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat)3 signaling has been implicated in the development and progression a number of malignancies, including PDAC. Although, the Janus Kinase (Jak)/Stat pathway is a potential drug target, clinicopathological, molecular, and prognostic features of Stat3-activated PDAC remain uncertain. Our aim was to determine the clinicopathological impact of this inflammatory pathway in resectable PDAC.Using a tissue microarray-based cohort of PDAC from 86 patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy with curative intent and complete clinicopathological data available, we evaluated expression of the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R)/Jak/Stat pathway by immunohistochemistry. IL-6R, Jak, phospho (p)-Jak, Stat3, pStat3(Tyr705), and pStat3(Ser727) were assessed in PDAC and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia. A Cox regression multivariate analysis model was used to determine factors influencing survival. Activation of the IL-6R/Jak/Stat3 pathway was compared with the systemic inflammatory response as measured by serum C-reactive protein levels.High pJak was associated with reduced overall survival in multivariate analysis when compared with those with moderate or low expression (p = 0.036 hazard ratio (HR) = 1.68) as was pStat3(Tyr705) (p < 0.001Activation of the Jak/Stat3 pathway via phosphorylation was associated with adverse outcome following resection of PDAC with curative intent supporting potential roles for pJak and pStat3 as prognostic biomarkers markers and therapeutic targets.
