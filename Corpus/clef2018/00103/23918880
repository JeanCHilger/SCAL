Effect of mesenchymal stem cells on renal injury in rats with severe acute pancreatitis. The aim of this study was to preliminarily investigate the effect of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on structural change of capillary endothelial barrier and expression variation of aquaporin 1 (AQP1) in kidney at the onset of renal injury caused by severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). Ninety male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were divided into the control group, the SAP group in which animals received induction of SAP and the MSCs-treated group in which SAP-induced animals were injected with MSCs. They were further subdivided according to the time point that the animals were killed 6 h, 12 h and 24 h after the closure of the incision, serum, pancreatic and renal samples were collected, respectively. The level of serum amylase (AMY), creatinine (Cr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were analysed, the change of pancreatic histology was assessed, the structural change of the renal interstitial capillaries was evaluated using the transmission electron microscope (TEM) and the location and expression of AQP1 in kidney were analysed using immunohistochemistry, quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. The outcomes showed that the level of serum AMY, Cr, BUN elevated, the damage of pancreatic tissue and renal capillary endothelial barrier was aggravated and the expression of AQP1 was reduced significantly after induced pancreatitis. But after treatments with MSCs, the elevation of AMY, Cr and BUN was inhibited, the damage of pancreatic tissue and renal interstitial capillary barrier was alleviated and the down-regulation of AQP1 was reversed. In summary, the MSCs therapy could alleviate renal injury in rats with SAP, the mechanism of which might be related to reduction of the damage to renal interstitial capillary endothelial barrier, and up-expression of AQP1 in kidney.
