Failure of secretin to prevent or ameliorate cerulein-induced pancreatitis in the rat. Infusion of supramaximal concentrations of the synthetic pancreozymin analog cerulein induces acute edematous pancreatitis in the rat. Vacuolization and necrosis of acinar cells is paralleled by an almost complete reduction of pancreatic secretion from the cannulated duct. Preinfusion or coinfusion of synthetic secretin slightly increases pancreatic volume and protein secretion. This effect is only transient, and is always overcome by the actions of cerulein. Secretin does not prevent or improve the cellular destruction of the acinar cells. The results suggest that secretin has no beneficial effect on hormone-induced pancreatitis.
