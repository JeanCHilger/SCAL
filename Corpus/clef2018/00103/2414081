Problems in experimental pancreatic segment transplantation with open duct. Using in-situ "autotransplantation model" and dogs with allotransplant of pancreatic segment with the open duct, we confirmed the capacity of the canine peritoneum to tolerate the presence of inactive pancreatic juice and to resorb it. However, non-living tissue surrounding the graft may induce activation of pancreatic juice and lead to acute pancreatitis. Diffuse interstitial fibrosis, unaffecting endocrine parenchyma, develops in all autologous and allogenic pancreatic grafts. Reduction of acinose parenchyma probably accounts for the gradual normalization of serum amylase levels. We assume that graft fibrosis is caused by a gradual closure of the pancreatic duct. Diffuse interstitial fibrosis cannot be classified as a rejection change. It antiplatelet drugs are not administered, graft necrosis is caused by splenic artery thrombosis at a low flow rate. In diabetic recipients with antiplatelet therapy both the animal and the graft survivals averaged 22.5 days. All dogs died of complications at a normal glucose metabolism. We hold that at present research should concentrate on vascular complications of pancreatic segment transplantation.
