Effect of peritoneal lavage on renal function in experimental acute pancreatitis. The purpose of this study is to analyse the effect of peritoneal lavage on renal function. Pancreatitis was induced by a forceful retrograde injection of 1 ml/kg of 15% Na-taurocholate into the main pancreatic duct of the dog. Dogs were divided into two groups. Group NT consisted of 7 dogs which received no treatment. Group PL consisted of 7 dogs which underwent peritoneal lavage (20 ml/kg) 5 times for 6 hrs each. In group NT, renal blood flow started to decrease at 1 hr after Na-taurocholate injection. At 6 hrs, renal blood flow decreased to 50% of the initial level. On the other hand, renal blood flow in group PL decreased to only 75% of the initial value at 6 hrs. Although FENa (excreted fraction of the filtered sodium) and urine N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase elevated in group pL, these values were significantly lower than those in group NT. Serum pancreatic enzyme levels in group pL were also kept lower than in group NT from 3 hrs to the end of the experiment with a significant difference. These results suggest that peritoneal lavage is effective not only for diminishing serum pancreatic enzymes but also protecting the kidney from ischemic damage on acute pancreatitis.
