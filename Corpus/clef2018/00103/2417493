In vivo rat pancreatic acinar cell function during supramaximal stimulation with caerulein. Infusion of a supramaximal dose of caerulein results in acute interstitial pancreatitis in rats. We report studies of in vivo pancreatic acinar cell function during the initial 3.5 h of supramaximal stimulation with caerulein (5 micrograms X kg-1 X h-1). Amino acid [( 3H]phenylalanine) uptake was not altered, and there was no change in the rate or extent of protein synthesis or in intracellular transport of in vivo pulse-labeled proteins from microsome to zymogen granule-enriched fractions. However, the discharge of labeled protein was markedly inhibited. Radioautographic studies indicated that the pulse-labeled proteins retained in the gland were not located extracellularly but had accumulated within acinar cells, with a preferential distribution at the cell apex (presumably in zymogen granules) and in large vacuoles that form within the cell during hyperstimulation. Supramaximal stimulation with caerulein also caused increasing amounts of amylase and labeled proteins to be recovered in the postmicrosomal fraction. These findings suggest that supramaximal stimulation causes digestive enzymes to become localized in organelles that are fragile and subject to disruption during tissue homogenization. These organelles may be the vacuoles noted in morphological studies and believed to represent immature condensing vacuoles and/or crinophagic vacuoles.
