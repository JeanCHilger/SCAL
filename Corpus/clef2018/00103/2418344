Changes in serum pancreatic enzymes and pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor in patients with severe acute pancreatitis. Serum pancreatic enzymes (amylase, trypsin, pancreatic elastase 1, pancreatic phospholipase A2) and serum pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (PSTI) were measured in 22 patients with moderate or severe acute pancreatitis. Serum levels of all pancreatic enzymes were elevated at the initial determination, but they fell rapidly to normal in both moderate and severe pancreatitis. In contrast, PSTI in severe pancreatitis increased after admission and reached the maximum on the second to the forth day after onset. There was a significant positive correlation between the level of PSTI and that of acute phase reactant (fibrinogen, alpha 1-antitrypsin), and serum PSTI in severe acute pancreatitis changed as if it was one of acute phase reactants. There was also a significant negative correlation between the level of serum PSTI and that of alpha 2-macroglobulin.
