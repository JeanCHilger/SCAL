Clinical and pathologic changes in experimentally induced acute pancreatitis in cats. Acute pancreatitis was induced in 6 cats by infusion of oleic acid into the pancreatic duct. Clinical changes included fever, tachycardia, and variable degrees of abdominal pain vomiting occurred rarely, and diarrhea was not noted. Serum lipase activities were significantly increased through the 4th day after the surgical operation, although amylase activities were significantly decreased during most of the acute phase. Serum calcium and phosphate concentrations were decreased significantly on the 4th day after surgical operation. Hematologic alterations included normocytic, normochromic, responsive anemias, but changes in WBC values were not statistically significant. Evidence of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency after induction of acute pancreatitis was not demonstrated in any cats during the study. The results of this study indicate that increases in serum lipase activity are the most consistent and earliest indicators of acute pancreatitis in cats, but that more sensitive methods of laboratory evaluation should be sought.
