Surveillance of intra-abdominal pressure and intestinal barrier function in a rat model of acute necrotizing pancreatitis and its potential early therapeutic window. To monitor intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and intestinal barrier function in a rat model of acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP) to elucidate a potential relevant therapeutic window.Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into experimental or control groups. The ANP group (n = 40) was injected with 4.5% sodium taurocholate into the pancreatic duct to induce ANP. The controls received only abdominal opening surgery (sham-operated, SO n = 40) or no treatment or surgery (baselineIAP showed a continuous upward trend in the ANP group, with values 2 to 3 times higher than those in the SO group at the corresponding time points and the rising rate was peaking at 6 h. The levels of plasma amylase, TNF-alpha, Cr, TB, DAO, and D-lactate also gradually increased in the ANP group over time and were significantly higher than in the SO group at 3, 6, 12 and 24 h (all P<0.05). Moreover, the rising rate of TNF-alpha, DAO, and D-lactate also peaked at 6 h.The ANP-induced changes in IAP, inflammatory factors and intestinal barrier that we observed in the rat model were especially obvious at 6 h post-induction, suggesting an early therapeutic window for the treatment of ANP in humans.
