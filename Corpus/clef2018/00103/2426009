Determination of amylase activity in serum by using a wheat germ inhibitor with the Du Pont aca. A rapid procedure for determining salivary- and pancreatic-type amylase (EC 3.2.1.1) in serum by incorporating a wheat germ inhibitor (from Triticum aestivum) was developed for the Du Pont aca IV analyzer. Under optimal assay conditions, activities of salivary and pancreatic amylase were inhibited by 93% and 19%, respectively. The 95% central reference interval for the percentage of inhibition of serum amylase was 38-84%. Patients with acute pancreatitis showed less than 26% inhibition of amylase after addition of the wheat germ extract, reflecting the prevalence of pancreatic-type amylase in this disorder.
