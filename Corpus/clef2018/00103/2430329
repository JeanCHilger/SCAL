Effects on peritoneal proteolysis and hemodynamics of prophylactic and therapeutic infusions of high doses of aprotinin in experimental acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis was induced in pigs by retrograde injection of Na-taurocholate into the pancreatic duct. Chromogenic peptide substrate assays showed increased trypsin (TRY) and plasma kallikrein activity (KK), parallel with a reduction of plasma prekallikrein (PKK) and functional kallikrein inhibition (KKI) values, in the peritoneal exudate in untreated animals. Intravenous high-dose pretreatment or therapy with aprotinin starting 3 h after the induction of acute pancreatitis resulted in significantly increased KKI capacity and unchanged KK and TRY activities in the peritoneal exudate. In test animals receiving aprotinin intravenously a significantly increased survival rate and improved cardiac output and arterial blood pressure were found during the 6-h observation period. All animals treated with aprotinin survived the observation period, whereas 63% of the untreated animals died. The study emphasizes the pathophysiological importance of the plasma kallikrein-kinin system in acute pancreatitis.
