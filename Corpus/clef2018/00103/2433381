Photometric determination of phospholipase A. A photometric method for the determination of phospholipase A is described, in which fatty acids are liberated from phosphatidylcholine and measured by a discontinuous enzymatic test. Optimal test conditions were evaluated using purified phospholipase A from human and porcine pancreas. The enzyme activities measured in normal human sera are in the range of 0 to 10 U/l. Pathological values reach more than 100 U/l. There is no correlation with the activities of lipase or amylase in cases of acute pancreatitis.
