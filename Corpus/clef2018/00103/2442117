Experimental acute pancreatitis. In vitro magnetic resonance characteristics. The effect of pancreatitis on magnetic resonance T1 and T2 relaxation times was evaluated in two different models of acute pancreatitis in the rat. Acute edematous pancreatitis was induced by repetitive intraperitoneal injections of the cholecystokinin-analogue caerulein acute hemorrhage pancreatitis was induced by retrograde infusion of the bile salt sodium taurocholate into the pancreatic duct. T1 and T2 relaxation times were obtained in vitro from fresh pancreatic specimens at 37 degrees C with a 0.25 resistive spectrometer. In both edematous and hemorrhagic pancreatitis, significant prolongation of T1 and T2 was noted as early as 1.5 hours after the initiation of pancreatitis when compared with normal rat pancreas. Maximal prolongation occurred at 7 hours in the caerulein model with T1 of 966 +/- 46 msec (mean +/- SEM) (normal + 278 +/- 12 msec) and T2 of 75.9 +/- 2.9 msec (normal = 32.8 +/- 3.3 msec), and after 6 hours in the bile salt model with T1 of 798 +/- 40 msec and T2 of 92.5 +/- 3.3 msec. After the time point of maximal prolongation, T1 and T2 gradually decreased toward the normal values. The prolongation of T1 and T2 paralleled each other throughout the time course of pancreatitis in both models. The prolongation of both relaxation times correlated closely with pancreatic weight, water content, and amylase concentration in serum and ascites. The present determination of T1 and T2 relaxation times by in vitro spectrometry suggests that magnetic resonance imaging has the potential for detecting early pathologic changes in acute pancreatitis and thus may be helpful for an early clinical diagnosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
