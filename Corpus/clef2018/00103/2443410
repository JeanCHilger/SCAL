Subcutaneous administration of the synthetic trypsin inhibitor Foy-305 induces hypertrophy of the exocrine pancreas. The serine protease inhibitor camostate (Foy-305 200 mg/kg body weight) had been administered twice daily either subcutaneously or orally to mice for 5, 10 and 15 days. Within 5 days, pancreatic weight, concentration of trypsin, amylase and protein were significantly increased and even more increased after 10 and 15 days. This effect is less pronounced after subcutaneous administration in comparison to oral treatment.
