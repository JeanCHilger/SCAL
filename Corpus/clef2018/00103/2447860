Acute pancreatitis: results of a protocol of management. To assess prognostication and therapy of 100 patients with acute pancreatitis, a randomized prospective multicentre clinical trial was commenced in August 1982. This study examines the usefulness of four parameters (sex, age, serum amylase and serum aspartate aminotransferase), coincidentally used as part of accurate and reliable prediction of severity of disease, in predicting gallstone aetiology, with an accuracy of 82%. The cost effectiveness and morbidity associated with the treatment of pancreatitis is also examined patients with mild to moderately severe pancreatitis are better managed with a peripheral intravenous crystalloid solution and routine ward observations, rather than with supplementary urinary catheter and antibiotics. Conclusions about the optimum treatment of patients with severe pancreatitis cannot be made
