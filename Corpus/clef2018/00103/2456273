Animal experiments on swine with regard to jejunal nutrition therapy. Bile and pancreatic secretion and changes in gastrointestinal hormones. The use of an elemental diet in the early postoperative or posttraumatic period is more and more common. Discussions about pancreatic stimulation during enteral infusion of an elemental diet are still contradictory. The aim of this study was to give some possible explanations on pancreatic and biliary secretion and the response of gastrointestinal hormones to an elemental diet infused into the jejunum in the early postoperative period. We therefore developed an experimental model in pigs. As our results show, there is an increased output of amylase in jejunal secretion when enteral feeding is started. Further a reduced biliary secretion which is possibly due to the reduced content of long-chained triglycerides in the used diet. The insulin and somatostatin levels remained within normal ranges during the whole period of investigations. We thought this to be an effect of the continuous pump controlled infusion of the diet. The slight hyperglucagonemia is explained by the surgical trauma. These findings support the usefulness of an elemental diet in the early postoperative period. Whether the benefits of an early enteral feeding can be used in acute pancreatitis needs further investigations.
