Diagnostic value of immunoreactive phospholipase A2 in acute pancreatitis. In a prospective clinical trial 85 patients with acute pancreatitis were analysed for serum total amylase, pancreatic amylase, pancreatic lipase, trypsin, elastase 1, and immunoreactive phospholipase A2 (IR-PLA2). The diagnostic sensitivity of serum IR-PLA2 was comparable to that of serum total amylase, pancreatic amylase, and trypsin. The specificity of IR-PLA2 is superior to that of serum total amylase determination due to the fact that the IR-PLA2 determination is based on an antibody against human pancreatic PLA2.
