Exocrine pancreatic function in tropical fibrocalculous pancreatic diabetes. Exocrine pancreatic function was studied by fecal chymotrypsin test in three groups of diabetic patients seen in southern India. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, as shown by low fecal chymotrypsin levels, was seen in 87.5% of patients with fibrocalculous pancreatic diabetes (FCPD), in 23.5% of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients, and in 4.5% of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients. There was no correlation between fecal chymotrypsin levels and serum amylase, serum lipase, age, body mass index, duration of diabetes, fasting plasma glucose, or glycosylated hemoglobin levels. The fecal chymotrypsin test is a useful additional investigation for the diagnosis of FCPD found in tropical countries.
