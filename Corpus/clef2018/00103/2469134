Effect of blood exchange transfusion as an initial treatment of acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis. The effect of blood exchange transfusion on experimental acute pancreatitis was investigated. Acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis was induced in rats by the injection of sodium taurocholate into the pancreatic duct. One hour after the induction of pancreatitis, blood exchange transfusion was carried out in these rats. The survival rates by 24 hr significantly increased in the exchange transfusion group as compared to those in the non-treated control group. Blood exchange transfusion, though had not significant effect on the macroscopic findings at autopsy, reduced pulmonary edema. These results suggested that blood purification by exchange transfusion may be beneficial for patients with acute pancreatitis, especially at an early stage.
