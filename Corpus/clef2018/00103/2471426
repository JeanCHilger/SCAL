Circulating concentrations of trypsin-like immunoreactivity and activities of lipase and amylase after pancreatic duct ligation in dogs. The possibility that assay of circulating trypsin-like immunoreactivity (TLI) could assist in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis in dogs has been examined by assaying plasma TLI concentrations after pancreatic duct ligation and comparing the results with plasma activities of lipase and amylase. Venous blood samples were obtained from 8 dogs before surgery, then daily for 5 days and at 14 days after ligation of pancreatic ducts. Plasma concentrations of TLI increased within 24 hours and tended to peak before and to decrease more rapidly than activities of lipase and amylase, remaining greater than the control range for 5 days in all but 2 dogs. Plasma lipase and amylase activities increased together and remained greater than the control range in all dogs for 5 days after surgery. Regression analysis of all postoperative data indicated significant correlations between concentration of TLI and lipase activity (r = 0.67, P less than 0.001), concentration of TLI and amylase activity (r = 0.53, P less than 0.001), and between lipase and amylase activities (r = 0.74, P less than 0.001). These findings suggested that assay of TLI may provide an early indication of acute pancreatitis in dogs. Because TLI is specifically pancreatic in origin, high plasma TLI concentration may prove a more reliable indicator of clinical pancreatitis than high activities of amylase or lipase, which may be derived from extrapancreatic tissues.
