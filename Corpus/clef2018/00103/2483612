Acute lithium toxicity--chorea, hypercalcemia and hyperamylasemia. Lithium is widely used in the management of patients with manic depressive illnesses. It is a valuable drug with a good safety record but occasionally causes severe disorders. A 71-year-old woman is described who previously had a good response to lithium carbonate treatment of a manic depressive illness. Because the patient appeared depressed and withdrawn, lithium carbonate dosage was increased. The development of confusion and choreiform movements precipitated hospital admission. The symptoms were relieved when lithium was stopped but recurred with the reinstitution of lithium. Spontaneous choreiform movements were again relieved on lithium withdrawal. Associated with the abnormal movements were alterations in the serum calcium concentrations, a rise in the parathyroid hormone concentration and a rise in the serum amylase concentration without features of acute pancreatitis.
