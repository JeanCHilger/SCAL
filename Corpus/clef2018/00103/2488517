Short-term survival in severe acute pancreatitis. Role of peritoneal lavage and conservative surgery. We evaluated the results of peritoneal lavage and conservative surgery in 64 consecutive patients with severe acute pancreatitis, 73.4% of patients had associated cholelithiasis. Early resective surgery, specially in patients with necro-hemorrhagic pancreatitis and respiratory failure, was associated to a high mortality. Peritoneal lavage was started earlier in survivors and was effective in decreasing pain and amylase levels, but not in correcting hypoxemia. 29% of patients died in shock, which developed early and was mostly toxic in patients older than 50 as opposed to septic in younger patients. Actuarial survival rate was 50% at 1 month. Poor risk factors included admission after 48 hr, resective surgery, age greater than 50 years and failure to use peritoneal lavage.
