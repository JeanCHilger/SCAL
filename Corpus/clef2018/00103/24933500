Relationship between modified CT severity index and clinical features of L-asparaginase-associated pancreatitis in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia. To describe clinical and CT features of L-asparaginase-associated pancreatitis (L-AP) and to correlate CT grades with clinical parameters.A total of 16 children (M:F = 9:7 mean age, 8.1Â years) who developed L-AP after L-asparaginase (L-asp) treatment and underwent abdominal CT scan were included. We retrospectively reviewed clinical data (age, sex, signs, and symptoms related to pancreatic toxicity and its complications, the number of L-asp doses receiving before L-AP)L-AP typically occurred early in the course of therapy. Use of IV narcotics (P = .014) and peak amylase (P = .009) showed a significant difference between mild and severe L-AP groups according to MCSI. Between the low and high score groups, Use of IV narcotics (P = .046), BUN (P = .039), and peak amylase level (P = .013) was significantly different. However, the L-asp dose, hospital day, and other clinical date associated with prognosis did not show any significant difference.In L-AP with pediatric ALL patients, MCSI may correlate with usage of IV narcotics, BUN, and peak amylase levels.
