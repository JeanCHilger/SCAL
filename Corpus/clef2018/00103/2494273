Phospholipase A2 activity in taurocholate-induced acute pancreatitis in the rat model. The activity of phospholipase A2 (PA2) was measured in the plasma of rats after the induction of acute pancreatitis. Buffered sodium taurocholate (3.75% w/v), injected into the pancreatico-biliary duct, was used to induce acute pancreatitis. Blood was taken at 1-h intervals for the measurement of phospholipase A2, glucose, lipase, and arterial gases. Plasma lipase was markedly elevated in the test groups, indicating acute pancreatitis, but no significant difference in PA2 activity was seen between the controls and the test group. However, in four animals the PA2 activity was elevated and in all cases this was accompanied by a low arterial pO2. This supports the theoretical role of PA2 in the pathogenesis of the respiratory complications observed in severe acute pancreatitis.
