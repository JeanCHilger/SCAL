Plasma exchange treatment for acute hyperlipidemic pancreatitis with falsely low levels of serum triglycerides - a case report. Hypertriglyceridemia is a well-recognized cause of acute pancreatitis. We present a patient with acute hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis. At presentation serum triglycerides were severely elevated (104 mmol/l) and were decreasing the next day (11 mmol/l). However, based on increasing levels of serum lipase, worsening respiratory failure and evidently lipemic serum, we decided to perform plasma exchange, and patient's condition improved dramatically. Repeated laboratory test of the serum obtained before the first plasma exchange revealed that the actual value of serum triglycerides was 57 mmol/l. A clinically-driven decision is crucial when treating patients with hypertriglyceridemic acute pancreatitis as the serum triglyceride levels can be falsely low.
