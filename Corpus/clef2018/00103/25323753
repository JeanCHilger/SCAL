Bilateral vagotomy attenuates the severity of secretagogue-induced acute pancreatitis in the rat. We assessed the effect of bilateral vagotomy (BV) on the course of acute caerulein-induced pancreatitis (AP) in the rat.The study was performed on Wistar rats surgically prepared by subdiaphragmatic BV. Control group underwent sham operation. Four days later, AP was induced by subcutaneous injection of caerulein (25 μg/kg/5h) to the conscious animals with or without BV. After administration of caerulein the blood samples were taken for determination of serum lipase activity and interleukin-10 (IL-10) concentration. Pancreatic tissue samples were subjected to histological examinations and to the measurement of lipid peroxidation products (MDA+4-HNE) concentration and the activity of an antioxidant enzyme - glutathione peroxidase (GPx). After application of caerulein pancreatic blood flow was measured by laser Doppler flowmetry.AP was manifested by oedema and neutrophil infiltration of the pancreatic tissue and accompanied by significant increases of serum lipase activity, serum concentration of IL-10 and pancreatic concentration of MDA+4HNE (ca. 50×, 2× and 4× respectively p ≥ 0.05). Pancreatic activity of GPx and pancreatic blood flow were decreased (both by 60%). In vagotomised rats with AP serum lipase activity and pancreatic concentration of MDA+4-HNE were lower whereas Il-10 concentration and pancreatic activity of GPx, as well as pancreatic blood flow were significantly higher as compared to AP rats with intact vagal nerves. In AP rats with vagotomy all histological signs of pancreatitis were significantly reduced.Bilateral vagotomy resulted in the significant attenuation of caerulein-induced pancreatitis in the rat.
