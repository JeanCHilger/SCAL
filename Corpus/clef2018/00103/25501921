Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β-induced microRNA-216a promotes acute pancreatitis via Akt and TGF-β pathway in mice. Both transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and MicroRNA-216a (miR-216a) were reported to be upregulated during acute pancreatitis (AP). Moreover, miR-216a can be induced by TGF-β.This study aimed to investigate how TGF-β and miR-216a involved in the pathogenesis of AP both in a mouse model and in rat pancreatic acinar AR42J cells.Cerulein-induced AP mouse model was established and pretreated with a TGF-β inhibitor, SB431542. Serum amylase, lipase, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin 6 (IL-6), TGF-β and histopathological changes of pancreas were determined. Expression of miR-216a was detected by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Bioinformatics was utilized to predict the targets of miR-216a. Expression levels of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 7 (Smad7), TGF-β receptor I, total Akt and pAkt were detected by Western blot.SB431542 significantly decreased serum amylase, lipase, TNF-α, IL-6, TGF-β, histopathological changes of pancreas and expression of miR-216a in cerulein-induced mouse (P < 0.05). TGF-β induced miR-216a in AR42J cells. PTEN and Smad7 were identified to be the possible targets of miR-216a. Transfection of miR-216a mimics (or inhibitors) in AR42J cells downregulated (or upregulated) the expression of PTEN and Smad7, thus affected the expression of downstream pAkt and TGF-β receptor I. The expression changes of these protein caused by miR-216a can be regulated by SB431542 both in mouse model and AR42J cells.TGF-β promotes AP by inducing miR-216a targeting PTEN and Smad7, thus through PI3K/Akt and TGF-β feedback pathway.
