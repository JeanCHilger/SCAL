Prophylactic somatostatin can reduce incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis: multicenter randomized controlled trial. Post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis (PEP) remains the most common complication of ERCP. Somatostatin may inhibit pancreatic secretion and has been tested for PEP prophylaxis. However, the results of previous studies are inconsistent. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether somatostatin can reduce the incidence of PEP.The study was a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial. A total of 908 patients with normal amylase levels who were undergoing ERCP were randomized to receive somatostatin 250 μg bolus injection before ERCP and 250 μg/hour intravenous infusion for 11 hours after ERCP (somatostatin group) or no somatostatin treatments (control group). The incidences of PEP and hyperamylasemia were compared in the two groups.The full analysis set included 900 patients (445 in the somatostatin group, 455 in the control group). PEP developed in 34 patients (7.5 %) in the control group (95 % confidence interval [CI] 5.4 % - 10.3 %) and in 18 patients (4.0 %) in the somatostatin group (95 %CI 2.6 % - 6.3 % P = 0.03). Hyperamylasemia occurred in 46 patients (10.1 %) in the control group (95 %CI 7.7 % - 13.2 %) and in 27 patients (6.1 %) in the somatostatin group (95 %CI 4.2 % - 8.7 %This study showed that somatostatin was effective and safe for the prevention of PEP and hyperamylasemia in ERCP patients.(ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01431781).
