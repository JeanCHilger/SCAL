Factors affecting pancreatic hyperamylasemia in patients undergoing peroral single-balloon enteroscopy. Acute pancreatitis following balloon-assisted enteroscopy is a rare but serious complication. The causative mechanism is uncertain and prevention strategies are not established. We conducted a retrospective study to clarify the risk factors for pancreatic hyperamylasemia.Eighty-four patients undergoing peroral single-balloon enteroscopy (SBE) were enrolled in this study. Serum pancreatic and salivary amylase levels were measured 2 h after endoscopic examination.We experienced three patients with post-SBE pancreatitis. Factors predicting pancreatic hyperamylasemia were: (i) elderly patients (ii) deeper insertionIt is important to measure pancreatic amylase and not total amylase after SBE. When carrying out peroral SBE, the distance of insertion should be reduced especially if the scope traces a clockwise loop or the subject is elderly.
