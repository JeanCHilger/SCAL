Somatostatin infused during acute pancreatitis retains its biological activity. Somatostatin (SST) is used in the treatment of acute pancreatitis (AP) to inhibit pancreatic exocrine secretion, which represents one of the goals of medical treatment in this disease. Its therapeutic efficacy, however, is poor. One hypothesis, which has not yet been investigated, is that i.v. SST might be broken down by blood proteolytic enzymes. In order to evaluate the structural integrity and biological activity of infused SST, somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (SLI) and levels of pancreatic enzymes were monitored in the blood stream during the infusion of SST-14 (3,5 micrograms/kg/h for 48 h) in eight patients with severe acute pancreatitis. SLI was measured by both radioimmunoassay (RIA) and high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results indicate that SLI levels increase promptly after the beginning of infusion, with a slower increase between 6 and 36 h, and a rapid increase again at 48 h. HPLC analysis shows a single peak of SLI with the same retention time as standard SST-14. Total amylase, lipase, and trypsinogen significantly decreased compared with pretreatment values (48, 63.1, and 77.4%, respectively) after 24 h of SST infusion, while a decrease in elastase 1 (62.6%) was observed later at 48 h. These results indicate that in severe AP, somatostatin recovered in plasma retains its biological activity: it inhibits pancreatic circulating enzymes, an action not influenced by breakdown of the peptide, as demonstrated by HPLC of the SLI measured in plasma.
