Clinical course of diabetic ketoacidosis in hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis. Hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis (HP) is an uncommon condition accounting for 1% to 4% of cases of acute pancreatitis, mostly associated with poor glycemic control. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) may complicate the clinical course of HP. Our objective was to identify clinical and demographic differences between HP and DKA patients compared with those without DKA.Fifty-five patients with HP were included. Diabetic ketoacidosis was diagnosed in 8 patients. We analyzed the severity, hospital stay, delay in oral intake, duration of insulin infusion, complete blood cell count, and triglyceride levels.Diabetic ketoacidosis was associated with a more severe HP. There were no differences in hospital stay, delay in oral intake, or duration of insulin treatment in both groups. Serum amylase, lipase, and triglyceride levels were similar. Previous diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, higher Ranson and APACHE II scores, and higher serum glucose level at admission were the only predictive risk factors for DKA and HP.Coexistence of DKA does not modify the clinical course of HP, although a more severe episode of HP in DKA patients. Diabetic ketoacidosis was associated with higher insulin doses, without impact in triglyceride levels. Diabetic ketoacidosis and HP should be considered when a previous diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and a severe HP are present.
