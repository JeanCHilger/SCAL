Serum antiprotease concentrations in dogs with spontaneous and experimentally induced acute pancreatitis. A significant decline (P = 0.047) in serum antiprotease concentration was detected in dogs with experimentally induced acute pancreatitis. Decreased serum antiprotease concentrations, similar in magnitude to those documented in the experimental dogs, were present in dogs with spontaneous, acute pancreatitis. These findings suggest that significant amounts of proteolytic enzymes escape into the systemic circulation during acute pancreatitis in dogs. These circulating enzymes may be involved in the extrapancreatic complications of acute pancreatitis.
