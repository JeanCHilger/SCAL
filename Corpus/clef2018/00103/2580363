Effect of plasma exchange on acute pancreatitis. Plasma exchange was performed in dogs with acute experimental pancreatitis to examine clearance of pancreatic enzymes. Plasma exchange of about 1.6 liters reduced levels of serum amylase, lipase, and phospholipase A2 in a graded fashion down to about 50%. Plasma exchange of 4 liters in a patient with severe pancreatitis produced similar clearance curves of amylase, lipase, trypsin and elastase levels.
