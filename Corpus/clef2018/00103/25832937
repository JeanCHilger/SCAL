Acute pancreatitis with an intramural duodenal hematoma. The patient was a 43-year-old man admitted to the hospital with intermittent epigastric pain and vomiting, without any evidence of trauma. Blood tests showed elevated lipase/amylase levels. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed pancreatitis complicated by an intramural duodenal hematoma (IDH). He was conservatively treated, and one month after admission, follow-up panendoscopy showed normal duodenal mucosa without luminal narrowing. Non-traumatic IDH is typically associated with coagulation abnormalities. Abdominal CT is an excellent tool for diagnosis in cases of acute abdomen. However, the pathogenesis of and relationship between IDH and pancreatitis remain unknown.
