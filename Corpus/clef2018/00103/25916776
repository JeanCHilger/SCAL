Prevention and treatment of complications for full-covered self-expanding removable metal stents in malignant obstructive jaundice. To explore the prevention and treatment of complications for full-covered self-expanding removable metal stents (FCSERMS) in malignant obstructive jaundice.The clinical data were analyzed retrospectively for 45 cases undergoing endoscopic biliary FCSERMS drainage for malignant obstructive jaundice from May 2012 to March 2014.Among them, 45 cases were successful one time. The parameters of liver function improved significantly with a jaundice efficiency of 91.1%. There were 4 dead cases. Among 19 cases of early complications, hyperamylasemia (n = 8), acute mild pancreatitis (n = 4), acute cholecystitis (n = 2) and hemobilia (n = 1) recovered after conservative treatments. Acute suppurative cholecystitis (n = 2) and acute obstructive suppurative cholangitis (n = 2) were cured by percutaneous transhepatic cholangial drainage (PTCD) and percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage (PTGBD). And late complications of obstructive jaundice (n = 3), acute suppurative cholecystitis (n = 4), acute cholangitis (n = 2), hepatophyma (n = 2) and acute pancreatitis (n = 1) were cured by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), PTCD and PTGBD.Various complications are associated with FCSERMS in malignant obstructive jaundice.However, positive and effective prevention and proper treatment reduce the incidence of complications.
