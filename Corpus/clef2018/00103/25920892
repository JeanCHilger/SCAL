Prediction of the severity of acute pancreatitis on admission by carboxypeptidase-B activation peptide: A systematic review and meta-analysis. The assessment of acute pancreatitis severity on admission currently remains a challenge to clinicians. A single, rapid biochemical marker would be preferable to clinical and radiological scoring systems. The aim of this study was to undertake a meta-analysis on the value of carboxypeptidase-B activation peptide (CAPAP) in predicting severity of acute pancreatitis on admission.Major databases and trial registries were searched to identify all relevant studies from January 1998 to March 2015. Pooled sensitivity, specificity and the diagnostic odds ratios (DOR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for each study and were compared to other biomarkers, if included, within the same study. Summary receiver-operating curves (ROC) were conducted and the area under the curve (AUC) was evaluated.In total, six studies were included. At the time of admission, the AUC of serum CAPAP for predicting severity of acute pancreatitis was 0.86 with pooled sensitivity, specificity and DOR of 0.90, 0.70 and 19.08, respectively. When serum CAPAP was compared with urinary CAPAP, the AUC, pooled sensitivity, specificity and DOR were 0.69 vs 0.88, 0.90 vs 0.81, 0.68 vs. 0.77 and 17.96 vs. 18.58, respectively. Similarly, the AUC, pooled sensitivity, specificity and DOR of serum CAPAP vs maximal serum C-reactive protein within the first 3 days of admission were found to be 0.97 vs. 0.82, 0.92 vs. 0.88, 0.81 vs 0.68 and 37.90 vs. 18.80, respectively.Both serum and urinary CAPAP have the potential to act as a stratification marker on admission in predicting severity of acute pancreatitis.
