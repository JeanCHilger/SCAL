Possible Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim-Induced Pancreatitis in a Complicated Adolescent Patient Posttraumatic Injury. Multiple medications have been associated with pancreatitis, however, data in the pediatric population are scarce secondary to the nonspecific presentation and infrequent diagnosis. The aim of this report is to characterize drug-induced pancreatitis in an adolescent patient.A 16-year-old African-American female presented with a surgical site infection 8 weeks after a motor vehicle accident with multiple traumas. Two weeks prior to the admission, the patient was hospitalized for a urinary tract infection (UTI) and was initiated on sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (TMP/SMX) daily for UTI prophylaxis. On day 13, the patient was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis with an amylase level of 187 units/L (normal = 30-110) and a lipase level of 987 units/L (normal = 23-208). TMP/SMX was discontinued, and pancreatic enzyme levels decreased but did not reach normal. The patient was asymptomatic at discharge.TMP/SMX was identified as the likely etiology of pancreatitis by the medical team. Evaluation with the Naranjo algorithm indicated a "possible" adverse drug reaction.Acute pancreatitis can have significant morbidity and mortality in the pediatric population but can go undiagnosed due to its lower incidence. Pediatric patients presenting with idiopathic abdominal pain should be evaluated for pancreatitis and drug therapy should be reviewed for potential causative agents.
