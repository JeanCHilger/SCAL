Serum Ischemia-Modified Albumin Levels in Experimental Model of Acute Pancreatitis. To establish whether the Ischemia-Modified Albumin (IMA), a new parameter of oxidative stress, has diagnostic role in experimental acute pancreatitis.Randomized controlled trial.Experimental Animal Center, Çanakkale Onsekiz Mart University, Çanakkale, Turkey, from May to September 2013.Sixteen Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups (n=8 each): Sham and AP groups. AP was induced by ligation of pancreatic duct. Serum IMA, amylase, lipase, AST, ALT and CRP were determined. The severity of pancreatitis was scored by a blinded pathologist under microscope.Serum IMA levels in the AP group increased significantly compared with the control group (p < 0.05). There was also a strong positive correlation between amylase and IMA levels.The present study showed in a rodent model that serum IMA might serve as an additional marker to monitor inflammation during pancreatitis.
