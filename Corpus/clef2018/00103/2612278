Extracorporeal lithotripsy of biliary lithiasis. 160 patients treated with an EDAP apparatus. Since February 1987, we have been using extracorporeal lithotripsy for certain cases of chronic biliary lithiasis, using an EDAP lithotripter. The technique is reserved for patients with less than four radiotransparent, or partially calcified calculi, less than 25 mm in size, within the context of a functioning gall bladder with no evidence of lithiasis in the C.B.D. Dissolution of the fragments after lithotripsy is ensured by bile salts, this treatment being continued for at least 3 months after the gall bladder has been completely cleared. 160 patients were treated using a total of 181 treatment sessions. Hospitalisation lasted on average 3 days, 1/5th of the patients suffered right hypochondrial pain and nausea for 24 hours. 17% of patients showed a transient elevation in alkaline phosphatase and 12% an elevation in amylase after the procedure. The rate of gall bladder clearance was 24% at 1 month, 40.7% at 3 months ans 50% at 1 year. 11 cholecystectomies were carried out (6.8%), 8 of which were essential. Bile duct migration occurred in 2 cases and produced oedematous pancreatitis in one case. Recurrent lithiasis was noted in 4 cases between 6 and 18 months after gall bladder clearance. 75% of cured patients had a single, radiotransparent stone less than 20 mm in diameter.
