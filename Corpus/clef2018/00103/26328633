Acute Pancreatitis as a Possible Indicator of Pancreatic Cancer: The Importance of Mass Detection. The aims of this study were to assess the incidence of pancreatic cancer and the contributing factors for the diagnosis of tumors in patients with acute pancreatitis and to gain insight into how patients with acute pancreatitis should be followed up.Using the electronic medical database of Shizuoka General Hospital, 177 patients admitted for acute pancreatitis in the past 6 years were evaluated retrospectively for pancreatic cancer.Twelve patients (6.8%) were newly diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. During the first hospitalization, 5 patients (41.7%) with a detected pancreatic mass underwent surgical treatment: the final tumor stages were IA, IIA, and IIB in 1, 2, and 2 patients, respectively. In 7 patients (58.3%) without a detected pancreatic mass at the first admission, a pancreatic mass was recognized on follow-up computed tomography (CT) in 2 patients with main pancreatic duct (MPD) dilatation, and 1 patient with recurrent acute pancreatitis. The tumor stages were IA, IIA, and IA, respectively. Among the remaining 4 patients without follow-up, the tumor stage was IV. The patient gender, age, MPD dilatation, tumor marker, and serum amylase level were not significantly associated with pancreatic cancer. The detection of a pancreatic mass on CT led to the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.Acute pancreatitis should be considered as a possible diagnostic indicator of pancreatic cancer. Various factors associated with acute pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer were not predictive of a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Only the detection of a pancreatic mass led to the early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Patients hospitalized for acute pancreatitis should be followed up with a diagnostic imaging modality.
