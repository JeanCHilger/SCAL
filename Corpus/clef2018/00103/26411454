Cystathionine-gamma-lyase gene silencing with siRNA in monocytes/macrophages protects mice against acute pancreatitis. Hydrogen sulphide (H2S) is an endogenous inflammatory mediator produced by cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE) in monocytes/macrophages. To determine the role of H2S and macrophages in inflammation, we used small interference RNA (siRNA) to target the CSE gene and investigated its effect in a mouse model of acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis is characterised by increased levels of plasma amylase, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the pancreas and lung. SiRNA treatment attenuated inflammation in the pancreas and lungs of mice following caerulein-induced acute pancreatitis. MPO activity increased in caerulein-induced acute pancreatitis (16.21 ± 3.571 SD fold increase over control) and treatment with siRNA significantly reduced this (mean 3.555 ± 2.522 SD fold increase over control) (p < 0.0001). Similarly, lung MPO activity increased following treatment with caerulein (3.56 ± 0.941 SD fold increase over control) while siRNA treatment significantly reduced MPO activity (0.8243 ± 0.4353 SD fold increase over control) (p < 0.0001). Caerulein treatment increased plasma amylase activity (7094 ± 207 U/l) and this significantly decreased following siRNA administration (5895 ± 115 U/l) (p < 0.0001). Cytokine and chemokine levels in caerulein-induced acute pancreatitis reduced following treatment with siRNA. For example, siRNA treatment significantly decreased pancreatic and lung monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 (169.8 ± 59.75 SD 90.01 ± 46.97 SD pg/ml, respectively) compared to caerulein-treated mice (324.7 ± 103.9 SD
