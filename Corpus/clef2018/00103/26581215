Decreased MIZ1 Expression in Severe Experimental Acute Pancreatitis: A Rat Study. We tested our hypothesis that Myc-interacting zinc finger protein 1 (MIZ1), a cell cycle regulator, suppressed inflammation, and therefore, represented a useful prognostic marker in patients with acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP) complicated by acute lung injury.Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into control and ANP groups at different time points. The MIZ1 protein expression was measured by Western blot and ELISA, and confirmed using immunohistochemistry. The severity of pancreatic and lung injury was evaluated by the injury score and wet/dry weight ratio. The severity of disease was evaluated by serum C-reactive protein (CRP). The MPO activity of lung tissue amylase levels and the degree of inflammation were evaluated by serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6 expression. The risk due to multiple factors was investigated by relationship analysis.The serum levels of CRP, amylase, TNF-α, and IL-6 were gradually increased at 6, 24, and 48 h in ANP when compared with the control rats. The MIZ1 expressions were greatly decreased in ANP rats, especially at 24 h. Statistical analysis showed that there were time-dependent differences in ANP rats when compared with control rats (6 vs. 24 or 48 h, P < 0.01). MIZ1 showed close negative correlation with the degree of pancreatic and lung injury, serum amylase, CRP, TNF-α, and IL-6 (P < 0.01, respectively).The decreasing MIZ1 expression was closely correlated with inflammatory response, and development of ANP. Decreasing MIZ1 levels indicate a risk for ANP.
