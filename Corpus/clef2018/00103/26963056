Assessment of Pharmacological Prophylaxis for Acute Pancreatitis Following ERCP in Patients with Choledoholithiasis. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is an effective tool in the diagnostics and treatment of bile duct diseases. Although minimally invasive, the procedure is associated with a risk of complications, with acute pancreatitis being the most serious. In recent years, high hopes have been placed on pharmacological prevention of acute pancreatitis after ERCP. The aim of the study was assessment of the efficacy of low-molecular-weight heparin and somatostatin in combination with diclofenac in the prevention of acute pancreatitis after ERCP.The study enrolled three groups of 30 patients diagnosed with cholelithiasis group I: patients who received low-molecular-weight heparin prior to ERCP, group II: patients who received somatostatin and diclofenac, group III: control group. The study assessed the incidence of acute pancreatitis, hyperamylasemia and increased CRP levels.Acute pancreatitis was observed in 13.3% of group I patients, 10% of group II patients and 16.7% of group III patients (no statistical significance). Hyperamylasemia was observed in 16.7% of group I patients, 16.7% of group II patients and 43.3% of group III patients. These differences were statistically significant. No significant differences were found in the occurrence of increased CRP levels among the study groups.No significant reduction in the occurrence of acute pancreatitis after ERCP was observed in patients who received pharmacological prophylaxis. A significant reduction in the occurrence of hyperamylasemia was found in drug-treated patients.
