DEVELOPMENT OF FUNCTIONAL AND MORPHOLOGICAL CHANGES OF A PANCREAS DEPENDING ON THE DURATION OF OBSTRUCTIVE CHOLESTASIS. To study the severity and timing of the development of functional (reversible) and morphological (irreversible) disturbances in the pancreas, depending on the duration of obstructive cholestasis.Obstructive jaundice in the experiment 18 dogs modeled by applying the loop stranglehold on the common bile duct, followed by observation for 30 days. We measured total bilirubin and fractions aspartate aminotransferase activity (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), the contents alpha-amylase, pancreatic lipase, glucose, histological examination of the pancreas (magnification of 100 times and 400).On day 3 the common bile duct obstruction bilirubin increased from 7.1 to 286.8 μmol/l, ALT--from 0.17 to 4.18 μmol*h/l, alpha-amylase from 89 to 186 U/L and lipase--to 68 to 179 U/L. Then there was a slight decrease in the parameters studied with repeated their increase to 15 hours. Morphological changes in the first three days were characterized by reversible (swelling), impaired organ that 14-16 days passed in organic (irreversible) changes.Dynamics of fluctuations in the level of liver enzymes in the pancreas and obstructive cholestasis correlates with morphological abnormalities in the pancreas and fit into the concept of general biological organism's reaction to injury.
