Clinical study on alcoholic pancreatitis in alcoholics (especially in ERP findings). The pancreatic functions (PFD test and 75g GTT), pancreatic enzymes (serum-amylase, urine-amylase, serum-elastase I and serum-lipase), alcohol consumption histories, clinical symptoms, histological findings in the liver and ERP findings have been examined in 66 alcoholic patients. Fourty two out of 66 cases (64%) showed abnormal ERP findings which were compatible with chronic pancreatitis. But among these 42 cases, only 9 cases (21%) showed clinical symptoms such as epigastralgia, back pain, diarrhea and emaciation which suggest the existence of chronic pancreatitis. The degree of liver damage, alcohol consumption have no significant correlation with ERP findings. Furthermore, the severe alcoholic pancreatitis occurred in patients having mild liver injury more than those having severe liver injury such as cirrhosis. And the data of pancreatic functions and enzymes could not confirm ERP findings especially in patients with mild and moderate pancreatic injury when compared to normal ERP findings. We concluded that asymptomatic alcoholic pancreatitis occurred more frequently in painless alcoholic. It may be not suitable for only using the normal pancreatic functions test to diagnose the alcohol induced chronic pancreatitis.
