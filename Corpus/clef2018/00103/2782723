Toxicosis in pigs fed selenium-accumulating Astragalus plant species or sodium selenate. Three groups of 5 pigs each were fed a high selenium (Se) diet by mixing either Astragalus praelongus (31.6 ppm Se in feed), A bisulcatus (31.7 ppm Se in feed), or sodium selenate (26.6 ppm Se in feed) with commercial hog feed. Ten control pigs were fed only commercial hog chow containing trace selenium (0.44 ppm Se). Pigs were fed for 9 weeks and necropsied when they had ataxia or paralysis. Blood was collected for hematologic and serum biochemical determinations, and samples of various tissues were collected and fixed in neutral-buffered 10% formalin for histologic evaluation or frozen for determination of selenium concentration. All forms of selenium induced clinical signs of weight and hair loss, with cracked hooves and inflamed coronary bands developing in all Na2SeO4-fed pigs and 1 A praelongus-fed pig, but not in A bisulcatus-fed pigs. Serum calcium, phosphorus, and albumin concentrations were unchanged or significantly decreased from prefeeding values in groups fed selenium. Serum aspartate transaminase (AST) activities in Astragalus species-fed groups, and amylase activities and PCV in all groups of pigs fed selenium, were increased. Serum alkaline phosphatase and creatine kinase activities were significantly increased in the A praelongus-fed pigs and significantly decreased in Na2SeO4-fed pigs. Terminal tissue and body fluid selenium concentrations were determined in all groups of pigs fed selenium and compared with values in control pigs. Urine and bile concentrations were increased by the greatest factor (40 to 100x), with tissue concentrations of selenium increased by a lesser factor (6 to 17x).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
