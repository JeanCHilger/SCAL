Use of somatostatin in acute pancreatitis of biliary origin. The aetiology of acute pancreatitis may be alcoholic, dyslipidaemic, post-operative, traumatic, cryptogenic or biliary and only the biliary form is considered here. Fifteen patients with biliary pancreatitis and blood amylase above 250 mg (n.v. less than 100) were encountered in 1984-85. Six patients were given traditional medical treatment and 9 somatostatin alone. Despite the limited number treated the results obtained in the second group appear to confirm the validity and efficacy of somatostatin. In fact given the rapid disappearance of pain and the normalisation of the altered blood parameters it was never necessary to administer somatostatin for more than 24-36 hours.
