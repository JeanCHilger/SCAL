Acute pancreatitis caused by Legionella pneumophila. A 57-year-old man had Legionella pneumonia and acute pancreatitis. The diagnosis of legionellosis was established by both culture and significant rise in antibody titer to Legionella pneumophila. The pancreatitis was diagnosed by elevated amylase and lipase values, peaking on the fourth hospital day, roentgenologic findings, and a clinical picture compatible with the disease. The patient was not an alcohol consumer and had had no previous pancreatic disease. We conclude that acute pancreatitis can be a manifestation of legionellosis.
