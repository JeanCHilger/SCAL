Gabexate mesilate in the treatment of acute pancreatitis. Results of a Hannover multicenter double-blind study with 50 patients. We investigated the effect of a new synthetic protease- and phospholipase A2-inhibitor gabexate mesilate (FOY) in a multicenter (6 hospitals in Hannover and vicinity) double-blind study on the clinical course of acute pancreatitis. 50 patients were randomized into two subgroups. One group was treated with 3 X 300 mgs of gabexate mesilate per day for 9 days as a continuous intravenous infusion, the control group received placebo. There was no difference in these two groups regarding age and sex, but there was a discrepancy concerning the severity (stage I-IV) of the acute pancreatitis at the onset of treatment. More of the patients in the gabexate mesilate-group had severe disease on admission to hospital. Of the 7 patients (14%) who died, 5 were in the gabexate mesilate-group whereas only 2 were in the placebo group. This difference in the mortality rate is not significant. There was, however, a significant difference at the 5% level between the verum-group and the control group concerning the decline in alpha-amylase activity in serum and the number of complications. The difference was greatest in alcohol induced acute pancreatitis. A non-parametric test showed a significant reduction in hospitalisation time in the gabexate mesilate-group. Due to the small number of patients and the inhomogeneous clinical course of the acute pancreatitis a definite conclusion concerning the effect of gabexate mesilate on the clinical course of acute pancreatitis is not possible. Further studies with a much greater number of patients and more homogeneous groups with respect to the severity of the acute pancreatitis at the onset of the therapy with gabexate mesilate or placebo are necessary.
