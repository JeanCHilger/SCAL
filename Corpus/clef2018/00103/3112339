Survival following rupture of a pancreatic abscess in a heart transplant recipient. A 43-year-old man underwent orthotopic heart transplantation for end-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy. Immunosuppressive therapy consisted of cyclosporine and corticosteroids. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was made on the ninth postoperative day and was based on clinical symptoms and an upper gastrointestinal barium study. Both serum and urine amylase values were normal. Abdominal ultrasound examination was nondiagnostic. Two weeks postoperatively, the patient's clinical condition deteriorated sharply. Chest and abdominal roentgenograms revealed free intraperitoneal air, as well as air in the lesser sac. Diagnosis of a ruptured pancreatic abscess was made, and he underwent immediate exploratory laparotomy. Four liters of purulent fluid were present in the peritoneal cavity. A ruptured pancreatic abscess was found, and it had dissected above the superior mesenteric vessels and down the right gutter over the inferior vena cava. After extensive retroperitoneal debridement and copious irrigation, multiple surgical drains were placed. The patient is now well and is performing normal daily activities 16 months after the transplantation procedure. The incidence and proposed causes of pancreatitis occurring after heart transplant are reviewed, and we discuss our management of this complication.
