Pathophysiological differences between paired and communal breeding of male and female Sprague-Dawley rats. Sexually mature, male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were housed in large communal breeding cages or in smaller paired breeding cages. Virgin control rats of the same age were housed similarly but segregated by sex. Breeders became obese, developed a fatty liver, and showed elevated levels of triglycerides, free fatty acids, and cholesterol. Breeders had high blood pressure, enlarged hearts, hyperglycemia, and islet beta cell degranulation. Serum enzymes, creatine phosphokinase, serum glutamic oxalo-pyruvic transaminase, serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase, and blood urea nitrogen levels were elevated in breeder rats. The adrenal glands of male breeders appeared hyperactive the adrenal glands of female breeders were thrombosed and appeared to be hypoactive. Male breeder rats developed microscopic aortic lesions only
