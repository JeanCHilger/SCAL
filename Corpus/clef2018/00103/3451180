A neuropsychic form of acute pancreatitis in a child. Apropos of a case. We report the case of an 11 year-old girl with idiopathic acute pancreatitis in whom initial clinical symptomatology was resumed in marked neuropsychic signs and atypical abdominal pain. In such unusual circumstances, measurement of amylase levels as well as abdominal echography are of value for the diagnosis.
