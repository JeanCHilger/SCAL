Plasma lipase properties as related to pancreatic condition. We examined the sensitivity to colipase of two types of lipase (EC 3.1.1.3) activity in plasma. Results were very similar for plasma lipase corresponding to that found in cases of acute pancreatitis and for swine pancreas lipase, whereas we found some differences between "pancreatitis lipase" and lipase from healthy subjects. Gel-filtration experiments suggest that the two forms of lipase in plasma have different relative molecular masses moreover, their avidity for antibodies against human pancreatic lipase differs. Guided by these studies, we propose optimal conditions for nephelometry of "pancreatitis" lipase.
