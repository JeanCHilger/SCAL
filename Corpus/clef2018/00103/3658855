Anorexia nervosa and pancreatic ascites. Acute alcoholic pancreatitis was undiagnosed in a patient with anorexia nervosa who subsequently developed pancreatic ascites and oedema, wrongly attributed to protein malnutrition alone. She became hyperphagic in an attempt to reverse the malnutrition and hence the abdominal swelling, indicating that the goal of attaining a thin shape was the major determinant of the eating disorder in this patient. Measurement of ascitic fluid amylase concentration should be carried out in all patients with unexplained ascites.
