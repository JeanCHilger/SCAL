Pancreatic ascites. Pancreatic ascites is an unusual yet increasingly more often recognized complication of inflammatory pancreatic disease. The gradual onset of abdominal distension in a debilitated patient who may not have marked abdominal pain is often misdiagnosed and commonly attributed to cirrhotic ascites or malignant ascites. Analysis of ascitic fluid enables the diagnosis to be made, even in the presence of a normal serum amylase. Treatment should be initially conservative, moving onto surgery after 4-6 weeks if no improvement has occurred. When the conditions has been diagnosed the prognosis is surprisingly good despite the poor presenting condition of most patients.
