Cimetidine in the treatment of acute alcoholic pancreatitis. A randomized, double-blind study. A double-blind study was made of the comparative effectiveness of cimetidine in the treatment of acute alcoholic pancreatitis. The study group was composed of 27 patients with acute episodes of alcoholic pancreatitis of mild to moderate severity. The patients were randomized into 2 groups, either receiving cimetidine, 300 mg four times daily or a placebo. Both groups were given intravenous fluids and meperidine hydrochloride (Demerol) as needed. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups as measured by a variety of clinical and laboratory parameters. The mean value of the daily serum amylase in the placebo group declined steadily to normal hyperamylasemia in this group persisted for 52 +/- 11 hr (mean +/- SE). By contrast, serum amylase in the cimetidine group peaked at 24 hr after the start of treatment and remained abnormal slightly longer
