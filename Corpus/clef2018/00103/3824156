The role of leukocytes in the production of oxygen-derived free radicals in acute experimental pancreatitis. Oxygen-derived free radicals mediate an important step in the initiation of experimental acute pancreatitis in the ex vivo perfused canine pancreas model. In other organ systems, circulating leukocytes may serve as one source of oxygen-derived free radical production. The current experiments were designed to evaluate the role of circulating leukocytes in the generation of injury in this model. Four experimental groups of animals were studied: group I consisted of controls (n = 6) group II had white blood cell (WBC) depletion (n = 4) in which the recirculating whole blood perfusate was depleted of 98% of its circulating leukocytes
