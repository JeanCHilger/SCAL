CT evaluation of pancreatic injury following splenectomy. A fluid collection in the left subphrenic space immediately after splenectomy is often associated with pancreatic injury. The configuration, location, and vascular supply of the tail of the pancreas explain this postoperative complication. Depending on the degree of injury, the CT findings may show swelling of the tail of the pancreas, ill-defined fluid collections, or a well-encapsulated pancreatic pseudocyst. The diagnosis is confirmed by percutaneous aspiration with amylase determinations and the demonstration of a pancreatic fistula. Failure to diagnose this complication promptly may lead to a protracted postoperative clinical course and the development of a subphrenic abscess or a pancreatic pseudocyst.
