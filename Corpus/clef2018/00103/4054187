A method for inducing exocrine atrophy and collecting juice from the nonatrophied pancreas in the rat. A method for the long-term diversion of bile in the rat is described. It was used to induce complete and uniform pancreatic exocrine atrophy, as confirmed by a marked loss of weight of the gland, very low pancreatic tissue amylase, and by histological examination. The technique induces changes in endocrinal function of the pancreas, since it increases pancreas insulin by a factor of 2.7, decreases glucagon by a factor of 0.19, and somatostatin by a factor of 0.6. The method was also used for collecting juice from the nonatrophied pancreas in the conscious rat, and may facilitate studies on pancreas physiology and pathophysiology.
