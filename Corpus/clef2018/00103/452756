Prognostic indices in acute pancreatitis (author's transl). In a retrospective study 55 patients with acute pancreatitis were reviewed in order to establish the prognostic value of 11 indices which can be determined either at admission of 48 hours after the onset of the disease. The results show: 1. the 5 indices determined at admission (age, white blood cell count, blood glucose, SGOT, LDH) do not permit a clear identification of the variable courses of acute pancreatitis, 2. a high risk group can be selected in this group an early intensive care is recommended, i.e. a vigorous fluid replacement, endotracheal intubation and assisted ventilation with PEEP, and, if necessary, peritoneal dialysis. Furthermore these indices are helpful to decide very early whether a patient has to be transmitted to a medical centre for intensive care and/or surgical treatment.
