Intraluminal hypertension as a pathogenetic factor of acute pancreatitis in the rat (author's transl). By the use of various experimental procedures with rats, the significance of intraluminal hypertension, caused by ductal obstruction, reflux of bile and duodenal reflux were considered with regard to their capacity for producing pancreatitis. The extent of the histological changes in the pancreas after 48 hours as well as the period of survival in the individual experimental groups served as the parameters for the comparison. The results show that the rise in intraluminal pressure is alone enough to produce acute pancreatitis. It follows from this that rise of pressure in the duct system caused by ductal obstruction may be the triggering factor in the induction of pancreatitis. Reflux of bile, bacterial colonisation of the pancreas by duodenal reflux as well as activation of proteolytic enzymes were not necessary a prior factors but ones which have an aggravating effect in the development of the disease.
