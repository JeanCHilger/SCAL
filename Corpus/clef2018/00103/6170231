Immunoreactive forms of cationic trypsin in plasma and ascitic fluid of dogs in experimental pancreatitis. A canine model of bile-induced pancreatitis has been employed to investigate time-dependent changes in the molecular forms of trypsin in blood and ascitic fluid in this disease. The distribution of immunoreactive trypsin as trypsinogen and trypsin bound to plasma inhibitors in ascitic fluid and plasma during the course of the disease has been investigated by means of a radioimmunoassay for canine pancreatic cationic trypsin. In addition, trypsinlike amidase activity was determined in plasma and ascitic fluid using Z-Gly-Gly-Arg-beta-Nap as substrate. Early plasma and ascitic fluid samples in four dogs that died contained primarily trypsinogen, while extensive activation of trypsinogen to alpha 2-macroglobulin and alpha 1-protease inhibitor-bound trypsin occurred in the course of the disease. A fifth dog survived and showed little activation of trypsinogen. In the four dogs that died, the levels of trypsinlike amidase activity in the ascitic fluid were substantial throughout the course of the disease. The plasma levels of trypsinlike activity in these animals were much lower, but increased during the disease process. The dog that survived had lower concentrations of trypsinlike activity in ascitic fluid and plasma. These results suggest that activation of trypsinogen resulting in inhibitor-bound forms of trypsin in ascitic fluid and plasma is important in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis.
