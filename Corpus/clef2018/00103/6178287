The safety and efficacy of a lipid-based system of parenteral nutrition in acute pancreatitis. Eleven patients with acute pancreatitis who received a lipid-based system of total parenteral nutrition were studied. The safety and efficacy of the intravenous feedings were assessed by comparing the clinical course and serum amylase and urinary diastase levels before treatment and during total parenteral nutrition. Lipid profiles were determined in four of the patients, and nutritional indices including nitrogen balance data were obtained in three patients. No exacerbations of pancreatitis were attributable to the intravenous feedings and the manifestations of the disease resolved or improved in eight patients. Nutritional indices stabilized or improved during total parenteral nutrition, and positive nitrogen balance was achieved in each of the three patients in whom it was measured. Significant hyperlipemia was not observed before or during the lipid infusions. The lipid-based system of parenteral nutrition was well tolerated and effective in this series of patients with pancreatitis.
