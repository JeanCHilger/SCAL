Changes in serum immunoreactive pancreatic elastase 1 in acute pancreatitis. Serum immunoreactive elastase 1 content was significantly elevated in acute pancreatitis. The mean content of the control group was 1.79 ng/ml (SD: 0.62 ng/ml), while that of patients with acute pancreatitis was 23.02 ng/ml (SD: 9.44 ng/ml). The increased content of pancreatic elastase 1 in acute pancreatitis continued for several days after onset, even though serum amylase activity had returned to normal.
