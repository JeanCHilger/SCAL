Value of blood lipase determination in pancreatic diseases. Comparison with blood amylase assay. The comparative diagnostic value of plasma lipase and amylase levels was evaluated in 90 patients with various symptoms of pancreatic disease. Comparison with healthy subjects showed that the lipase assay was more sensitive than the amylase assay in patients with acute pancreatitis or post-traumatic pancreatic injury, but not in patients with chronic pancreatitis. On the other hand, acute pancreatitis can be detected earlier by measuring plasma amylase levels, owing to the rapid release of this enzyme. The relative importance of these two laboratory tests is discussed.
