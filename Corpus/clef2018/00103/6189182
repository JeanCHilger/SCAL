Clinical significance of pancreas divisum. Pancreas divisum was demonstrated in 22 of 500 consecutive ERCP (4.4%). Among patients with otherwise normal ERCP, pancreas divisum was found in 12.8%. In contrast, only 1.8% of patients with other pathology in the ERCP exhibited pancreas divisum (p less than 0.001). In relation to the clinical indication, pancreas divisum was found in 13.3% of patients with suspected or proven pancreatitis, in 1.9% of patients with suspicion of biliary tract disease (p less than 0.001), in 1.9% of patients with suspicion of pancreatic cancer (p less than 0,05) and in 4.4% of patients with epigastric pain of undetermined origin (p greater than 0.05). In 14 patients pancreas divisum was the only pathological finding in a thorough clinical and gastrointestinal workup 6 of the 14 patients had had typical episodes of pancreatitis, in 6 other patients there was clinical and biochemical evidence of pancreatic disease (mainly pain and hyperenzymemia), and the last 2 cases had chronic epigastric pain without biochemical abnormalities. In 2 patients of this series the pancreas divisum was misinterpreted morphologically (sonography, autopsy) as tumor of the head of the pancreas. Based upon our experience and the literature, the following practical conclusions can be drawn: 1. Pancreas divisum may cause typical episodes of acute (relapsing) pancreatitis. 2. In patients with chronic epigastric pain associated with hyperenzymemia but without typical acute pancreatitis, pancreas divisum may be the cause. 3. Morphologically pancreas divisum may mimic a pancreatic tumor (sonography, computer-tomography, autopsy).
