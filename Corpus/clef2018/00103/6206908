Hyperlipidaemia, alcohol abuse and acute pancreatitis. Of 311 patients with primary acute pancreatitis, seven revealed major and seven minor lipid abnormalities on hospital admission. One pregnant woman suffered acute pancreatitis associated with Fredrickson type I hyperlipoproteinaemia. Twelve of the 13 men with types IV and V hyperlipoproteinaemia suffered alcohol abuse pancreatitis and represented 13.2 per cent of this aetiological group. However, only one of the 157 patients (0.6 per cent) with biliary disease had lipid abnormalities. Two of the 13 men died--the oldest, who had gallstones, and one with alcohol related disease. The remaining 11 were subject to follow-up (5-10 years). Six, who had improvement of their lipid abnormalities, had abstained from alcohol. The other five had a persistent lipid disorder, and all admitted continuing heavy alcohol ingestion. The clinical diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was supported by serum amylase elevation in only nine of the fourteen patients. Urinary amylase levels were consistent with the diagnosis in 11 of the 12 patients. Estimation of both serum and urinary amylase gave 100 per cent support to the clinical diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. Hyperlipidaemia associated with acute pancreatitis may be secondary to alcohol abuse but the possible role of HLP cannot be discounted. Urinary amylase is useful in diagnosing acute pancreatitis in the presence of hyperlipidaemia.
