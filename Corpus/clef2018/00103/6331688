Animal experiment studies on the role of ischemia in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis. The influence of a short-term ischemia of the pancreas for the pathogenesis of a hemorrhagic necrotising pancreatitis was investigated in 28 mongrel dogs. Ischemia of the pancreas in 20 minute intervals repeated three times did not leave any macroscopic, histologic or electron microscopic changes and no alterations of the level of the alpha-amylase, the lipase, and the glucose in the serum. An ischemia of 20 minutes' duration by starvation of the celiac artery and the superior mesenteric artery produces a hemorrhagic necrotising pancreatitis under the precondition of a following pancreatic edema by ligature of the pancreatic duct and secretomotoring with secretin and pancreozymin. The necrosis starts histologically in the perilobular adipose and affects the parenchyma later. Whether the lipase is the starting enzyme for the acute pancreatitis or only conditions the early adipose necrosis should be discussed after these findings. Already a fugitive pancreatic edema produces a hemorrhagic necrotising pancreatitis after previous ischemic damage.
