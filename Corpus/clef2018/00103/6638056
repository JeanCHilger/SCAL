Initial diagnosis of lipoprotein lipase deficiency in a 75-year-old man. Lipoprotein lipase deficiency, characterized by recurrent pancreatitis, profound hypertriglyceridemia, and delayed clearance of chylomicrons, is generally first diagnosed in childhood. Although patients with this condition have died during episodes of acute pancreatitis in the fourth and fifth decades, no patient older than 50 years has been previously reported. The de novo diagnosis of lipoprotein lipase deficiency in a 75-year-old man illustrates important points about this disease. This inborn error in metabolism may have a relatively benign clinical course resulting in normal life span, particularly if there is strict adherence to a low-fat diet and abstinence from alcohol. Moreover, measurement of lipoprotein lipase activity in persons with severe hypertriglyceridemia and recurrent abdominal pain, even in elderly patients, should lead to the correct diagnosis and treatment of this condition.
