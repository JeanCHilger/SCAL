Modification of human pancreatic amylase isozymes by peptidoglutaminase I and II. The effects of peptidoglutaminase (PGln-ase) I and II on human pancreatic juice amylase purified as an isozyme were investigated. Several amylase isozymes were formed which corresponded to minor components of pancreatic amylase isozymes, indicating that appearance of amylase isozymes are due to enzymic deamidation. A similar result was observed when the purified amylase isozyme was incubated with the supernatant of human pancreatic juice whose amylase was previously removed by adsorption onto raw corn starch. These findings are discussed in connection with amylase isozymes in the sera of the patients suffering from pancreatic inflammation.
