Acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis and diabetes mellitus following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is generally regarded as a safe and useful investigation in the diagnosis and management of diseases of the pancreas and biliary tree. Asymptomatic hyperamylasemia is not uncommon following this procedure, but clinical pancreatitis is rare. The authors report on a 56-year-old man who suffered life-threatening acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis 2 weeks after ERCP was performed for the investigation of abdominal pain. He subsequently had insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, which was not present at the time of ERCP.
