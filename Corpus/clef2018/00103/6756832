A randomized trial comparing cimetidine to nasogastric suction in acute pancreatitis. Clinical and experimental evidence has suggested that the use of cimetidine might be harmful to patients with acute pancreatitis. We conducted a randomized study comparing cimetidine to nasogastric (NG) suction in 95 patients with 103 episodes of mild to moderately severe, acute or relapsing pancreatitis (86.4% alcohol related). The groups were comparable on entry to the study, and daily evaluation of several clinical and laboratory criteria revealed no consistent differences between the two groups. When these same criteria were evaluated for time of return to normal, if abnormal on entry to the study, no differences were found. The cimetidine group had a significantly shorter stay in the hospital than did the NG group (6.8 +/- 2.7 vs 8.5 +/- 4.8 days). Neither the incidence of relapse or complication nor the duration and extent of hyperamylasemia were significantly different between patients treated with cimetidine or NG suction. We conclude that cimetidine is safe to use in patients with mild to moderately severe alcohol-related pancreatitis, but it offers minimal advantage over NG suction.
