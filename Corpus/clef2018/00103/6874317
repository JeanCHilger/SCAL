Lipase clearance in experimental acute pancreatitis. Renal clearance of lipase, expressed as a proportion of simultaneous creatinine clearances was evaluated in an experimental model of acute pancreatitis in the rat. The lipase creatinine clearance ratio resulted very low in normal and control animals, while in rats with acute pancreatitis it increased regularly, significantly and proportionally to the degree of pancreatic damage. These observations indicated that, in this experimental model, the increased lipase creatinine clearance ratio is a sensitive index of acute pancreatitis, providing a basis for using the test in clinical practice.
