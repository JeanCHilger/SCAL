Metrizamide as contrast medium in endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography. Endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) has been performed in 17 patients using metrizamide (Amipaque) as contrast medium, and in 33 using meglumine diatrizoate (Urografin). The quality of pancreatograms obtained has been compared, using a specially developed scoring system, an any clinical and biochemical evidence of (acute) pancreatitis following ERCP observed. The mean pancreatogram score was slightly higher when Amipaque was used but there was no difference in the frequency or extent of hyperamylasaemia between the two groups. The slight advantage of Amipaque is not sufficient to overcome the disadvantages of its relatively high cost and inconvenience in use.
