A point mutation in the VP4 coding sequence of coxsackievirus B4 influences virulence. In analyzing the molecular determinants of virulence of coxsackievirus B4, chimeric viruses were constructed from avirulent and virulent viruses. The vCB424 recombinant contained a single nucleotide substitution on an avirulent genetic background, resulting in replacement of Ser-16 of VP4 with Arg-16. Mice infected with vCB424 displayed an intermediate phenotype.
