Native and graft pancreatitis following combined pancreas-renal transplantation. Ten patients who had undergone whole-organ pancreas transplantation and pancreatoduodenocystostomy from a total of 60 simultaneous cadaveric kidney-pancreas transplants met the criteria for graft pancreatitis. This condition is clearly different from acute rejection on the basis of marked hyperamylasaemia and significant local findings over the allograft. Graft rejection was the cause of graft loss in one of the patients eight are alive, seven with a functioning graft 61, 30, 27, 25, 21, 18 and 14 months after transplantation. Two patients died: one from severe graft pancreatitis and the other from cytomegalovirus infection. Bladder drainage with or without antibiotics has been the most common therapy, based on the theory that damage is caused by duodenal content and infected urine reflux. To prevent graft loss, antiviral treatment should be given when pancreatitis due to cytomegalovirus is suspected or diagnosed. Two patients with native pancreatitis are also described
