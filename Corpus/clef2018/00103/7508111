Reversibility of pancreatitis after temporary pancreaticobiliary duct obstruction in rats. Pancreaticobiliary duct (PBD) obstruction in rats is associated with hyperamylasemia, hyperlipasemia, pancreatic edema, inflammation, and subcellular enzyme redistribution in < 24 h. The purpose of our study was to investigate whether these changes are reversible. A catheter was placed in the distal PBD and tunneled subcutaneously to the nape of the neck where flow could be controlled. The distal end was secured into the duodenum. Animals were divided into five groups: Group I, free flow for 48 h Group II, catheter obstruction for 24 h
