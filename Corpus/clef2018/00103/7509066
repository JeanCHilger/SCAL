Prostaglandin D2, F2 alpha, E2, and E1 in early phase of experimental acute necrohemorrhagic pancreatitis in rats. Changes in endogenous pancreas production of prostaglandins D2, F2 alpha, E2, and E1 in early stages of acute necrotizing pancreatitis induced by intraductal administration of 3.5% sodium taurocholate have been determined by radioimmunoassay of chromatographically purified tissue extracts. For this purpose 18 male Wistar rats were randomized in three groups: control, pancreatitis, and pancreatitis plus indomethacin. Pancreas tissue samples were obtained 5 min after pancreatitis induction. In the pancreatitis-induced group, prostaglandins D2, F2 alpha, and E2 show significantly increased tissue levels relative to the controls whereas prostaglandin E1 remains unmodified. These results suggest a role for series 2 prostaglandins in the earlier stages of pancreatitis.
