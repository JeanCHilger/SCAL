Is the identification of acute biliary and alcoholic pancreatitis by early pancreatic enzyme assay possible?. Early and appropriate treatment of acute pancreatitis (AP) depends on early causal diagnosis. Published studies have shown favourable results following sphincterotomy performed within the 72 hours of onset of severe gallstone-associated AP. Among the various bio-clinical indices, the lipase/amylase (L/A) ratio, computed within 72 hours after onset, has been shown to discriminate between alcoholic and non alcoholic AP. Our study evaluates the data of biochemical disorders in 51 patients presenting with an episode of AP these patients were divided into 3 groups: A: alcoholic AP, n = 15
