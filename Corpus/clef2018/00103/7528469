The lipase to amylase ratio in acute pancreatitis. The ratio of serum lipase to serum amylase has been proposed to distinguish acute episodes of alcoholic from nonalcoholic pancreatitis. We evaluated the efficacy of this test in a community hospital setting.Charts of all patients discharged with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis over 19 months were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were excluded if their creatinine was greater than 3.0 mg/dl, if the amylase and lipase were not measured within 72 h of the onset of symptoms, or if the cause of pancreatitis was not known by the time of discharge.Of the 56 patients, 31 had alcoholic pancreatitis. The lipase to amylase ratio did not differ significantly between patients with alcoholic and nonalcoholic pancreatitis. Median amylase and lipase were significantly higher in nonalcoholic pancreatitis however, the wide ranges of both meant that neither amylase nor lipase accurately determined the cause of pancreatitis.The lipase to amylase ratio does not appear to be sufficiently sensitive or specific to distinguish alcoholic from nonalcoholic acute pancreatitis.
