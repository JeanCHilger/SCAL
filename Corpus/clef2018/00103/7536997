The effect of the long-acting somatostatin analogue octreotide on caerulein-induced pancreatic injuries in rats. The efficacy of long acting somatostatin analogue, octreotide acetate (SMS 201-995) on the caerulein-induced acute pancreatitis and on the regeneration of the gland was examined. The effect of the drug on the acute injury was examined at 6 and 24 hours following the intervention, while the regeneration was examined on Day 3 and Day 5 in all cases by determination of plasma amylase levels and by analysis of the pancreatic tissue. The use of octreotide could not counteract the occurrence of acute pancreatitis, however, it has some benefit as seen by it's ability to moderate the increases of serum amylase levels. During the examination of pancreatic regeneration it was found that the weight of the pancrease decreased and this was not affected by octreotide. As a matter of fact, the octreotide coadministered with caerulein counteracted the caerulein-induced increase of pancreatic DNA content and therefore acted against the reactive pancreatic hyperplasia. Thus long term administration of octreotide in acute pancreatic injury may not be rational.
