Intrapancreatic zymogen activation and levels of ATP and glutathione during caerulein pancreatitis in rats. Studies in acutely inflamed pancreatic tissue in humans and animals suggest that premature activation of proteases within the gland plays a key role in its pathophysiology. The present study aimed to detect such protease activation in relation to protease inhibition and to changes in the concentrations of the vital cellular compounds ATP and glutathione in pancreatic tissue during caerulein-induced pancreatitis in rats. Within 1 h after supramaximal stimulation by intraperitoneal caerulein injection, pancreatic tissue activities of enzymatically active trypsin and elastase showed significant increases, accompanied by a twofold increase in trypsin inhibitory capacity. Over the same time course pancreatic ATP and glutathione concentrations dropped to 38% and 47%, respectively, after 1 h and reached a nadir of 22% and 28%, respectively, after 4-8 h. Intrapancreatic trypsin activation in this model, despite increasing trypsin inhibitory capacity, indicates concealed liberation of even more protease or enzyme-inhibitor complex instability. It is hypothesized that early acinar glutathione depletion, in part due to diminished ATP, could play a role in the premature activation of digestive enzymes by impairment of the integrity of the cytoskeleton and cell organelles or lowered defense capabilities against oxidant stress, finally leading to acute pancreatitis.
