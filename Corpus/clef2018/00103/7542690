Effects of tetraprenylacetone on pancreatic exocrine secretion and acute pancreatitis in two experimental models in rats. The effects of tetraprenylacetone (TPN), an acyclic polyisoprenoid with antiulcer actions, on pancreatic exocrine secretion, and its preventive and therapeutic effects on acute pancreatitis in two experimental models were studied in rats. Intraduodenal administration of TPN (0, 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg/h) caused dose-dependent increases in pancreatic juice and bicarbonate output without increasing protein output and plasma cholecystokinin (CCK) concentrations. TPN-stimulated pancreatic exocrine secretion was completely abolished by antisecretin serum but it was not by CCK receptor antagonist loxiglumide (50 mg/kg/h). In acute pancreatitis induced by four subcutaneous injections of 20 micrograms/kg cerulein at hourly intervals over, 3 h, TPN (400 mg/kg) given by an oral route either 1 h before the first cerulein injection or immediately after the last injection significantly reduced the increases in serum amylase and lipase activities and pancreatic wet wt. Pretreatment with TPN caused histologic improvements, whereas posttreatment failed to ameliorate histologic alterations. In severe type of acute pancreatitis induced by retrograde intraductal injection of 1.0 mL/kg of 4% sodium taurocholate, TPN exerted no apparent beneficial effects on biochemical and histologic alterations of acute pancreatitis. It is concluded that TPN given by an oral route stimulates pancreatic exocrine secretion through an increase in endogenous secretin release and causes beneficial effects on the experimental model of mild acute pancreatitis in rats.
