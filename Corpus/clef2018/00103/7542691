Does acute ingestion of large amounts of alcohol cause pancreatic injury? A prospective study. The contribution of ethanol to the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis has been questioned for a long time. The authors asked whether acute ingestion of large amounts of alcohol may lead to pancreatic injury, as assessed by serum amylase levels, clinical picture, and abdominal ultrasound. Therefore, all patients (N = 122) admitted to our medical emergency ward with the diagnosis of alcohol intoxication were evaluated prospectively during a 12-mo period. Of these, 78 (56 M, 22 F mean age 36 +/- 15) could be evaluated. The other 44 were excluded because of incomplete data (n = 18), mixed intoxications (n = 8), repeated admission (n = 9), incorrect diagnosis on admission (n = 7), and chronic pancreatitis (n = 2). Serum ethanol, amylase, and GOT were measured. Serum ethanol was 246 +/- 122 mg/dL (3-500 mg/dL), amylase 83 +/- 44 U/L (27-361 U/L), and GOT 25 +/- 37 U/L (5-271 U/L) without significant differences among the genders. No correlation between serum ethanol and serum amylase levels could be detected.
