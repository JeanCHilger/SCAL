Time-course changes in pancreatic laboratory and morphologic parameters in two different acute pancreatitis models in rats. The aim of this work was to study in rats the temporal course of laboratory parameters and morphologic features in acute pancreatitis induced by cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) or by a closed duodenal loop. Pancreatitis was induced either with an overdose of CCK-8 (3 x 75 micrograms/kg at 1 h intervals) or by ligation of the duodenum on both sides of the bilio-pancreatic duct. The animals were examined at 0, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 24 h after AP induction. In CCK-8-induced acute pancreatitis, the pancreatic weight/body weight ratio (8.2 +/- 1.1 mg/g) and the amylase level (44.8 +/- 7.5 x 10(3) U/ml) were significantly increased vs. the controls (4.5 +/- 0.8 mg/g and 3.3 +/- 0.2 x 10(3) U/ml, respectively) 2 h after the intervention. The plasma CCK was significantly increased at 4 h (4.55 +/- 1.7 pM) and remained elevated thereafter. The tissue malonyldialdehyde concentration was significantly elevated at 8 h (0.28 +/- 0.07 mumol/mg pancreas) vs. the controls (0.20 +/- 0.02 mumol/mg pancreas). In closed duodenal loop-induced acute pancreatitis, the ratio pancreatic weight/body weight steadily increased during the study it reached its maximum level at 24 h (7.1 +/- 0.5 mg/g) vs. the sham-operated control (4.8 +/- 0.9 mg/g). The serum amylase level was significantly elevated at 2 h (47.1 +/- 9.3 x 10(3) U/ml), and then decreased steadily. Plasma CCK values were significantly higher than the controls throughout the study. A significant increase in the tissue malonyldialdehyde concentration (0.94 +/- 0.15 mumol/mg vs. 0.20 +/- 0.01 mumol/mg pancreas) appeared at 4 h. Our data indicate that in CCK-8-induced acute pancreatitis the laboratory signs of pancreatitis are most expressed at 4 h, whereas the morphologic changes culminate 8 h, following the last CCK injection. In closed duodenal loop-induced acute pancreatitis, the histologic findings showed a progressive deterioration. Endogenous CCK and oxygen-derived free radicals seem to play a role in the pathogenesis of both types of acute pancreatitis.
