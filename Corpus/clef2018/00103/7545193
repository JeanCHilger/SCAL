Celiac sprue and macroamylasemia: potential clinical and pathophysiological implications. Case study. In a patient with celiac sprue, abdominal complaints were ascribed to acute pancreatitis in the setting of hyperamylasemia and choledocholithiasis. The problem turned out to be macroamylasemia associated with elevated serum immunoglobulin A. The patient remained stable for 4 years with no specific intervention except gluten restriction. An association between celiac sprue or other malabsorptive states and macroamylasemia requires more study.
