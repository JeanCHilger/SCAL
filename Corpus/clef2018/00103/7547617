Pancreatic enzyme supplementation in acute pancreatitis. This study evaluates the effect of oral pancreatic enzyme supplements on pain, analgesic requirement and the incidence of complications in patients with acute pancreatitis. This double blind, prospectively randomised placebo controlled study included 23 patients. Pain was monitored using a visual analogue scale the analgesic requirement was assessed with a numerical score. No significant differences were noted between the median (range) pain scores of patients who received placebo: 22 (17.1-58) and those who received enzymes: 23 (11.3-63). Hospital stay was 7 (5-10) days in patients on placebo and 8 (6-24) days in the enzyme group (p = 0.069). Analgesic requirements were: placebo 20 (6-60) and enzymes: 16 (0-63) (p = 0.56). This study has shown no beneficial effect of oral pancreatic enzyme supplements in the initial management of patients with acute pancreatitis.
