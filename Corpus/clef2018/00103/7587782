Cholecystokinin-8 induces edematous pancreatitis in dogs associated with short burst of trypsinogen activation. To study the early pathogenesis of acute edematous pancreatitis in dogs, we examined the relationship of pancreatic hyperstimulation with cholecystokinin-8 (10 micrograms/kg/hr intravenously for 6 hr) to alterations in circulating pancreatic enzymes and pancreatic morphology with special reference to trypsinogen activation. Cholecystokinin-8 infusion was associated with increases in plasma amylase, lipase, trypsin-like immunoreactivity, and plasma and urine trypsinogen activation peptide. Pancreatic parenchymal swelling and interlobular and subcapsular fluid accumulations were detected ultrasonographically within 2 hr of cholecystokinin-8. Circulating trypsin-like immunoreactivity and trypsinogen activation peptide in urine reached a peak at 2 and 4 hr, respectively, then declined despite progressive increases in circulating amylase and lipase and intrapancreatic fluid. No significant changes were observed in dogs receiving a saline infusion. This study illustrates that cholecystokinin-8 induces edematous pancreatitis in dogs that is associated with a short-lived burst of trypsinogen activation.
