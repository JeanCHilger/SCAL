Therapeutic strategies for pancreatic pseudocysts. During the last 15 years, a total of 26 patients were treated for pancreatic pseudocysts, at the 2nd Department of Propaedeutic Surgery, University of Athens. There were 16 (61.5%) men and 10 (38.5%) women aged between 19 and 82 years old (mean age 61 years). Dominating symptoms in most patients were epigastric mass and pain, nausea, vomiting, mild fever and leucocytosis, and persistent elevation of serum amylase. Imaging studies, such as ultrasound, CT scan, and ERCP, were mostly helpful in establishing diagnosis. In most cases, attack of acute pancreatitis preceded with the exception of two cases where there was chronic pancreatitis and another which was post-traumatic. Rapid progression of underlying pancreatitis led to urgent laparotomy in two patients (7.7%). Elective surgery was performed in 22 patients (84.6%), 1-7 months after onset of pancreatitis (median 2 months). Selection of operative procedure depended on the patient and cyst condition. Cystogastrostomy was performed in 18 patients (69.2%), cystojejunostomy in three patients (11.5%), and external drainage in three patients (11.5%). There were three postoperative deaths (11.5%). Haemorrhage and infection were the main complications. Percutaneous drainage was performed in two cases (7.7%) (one for a cyst remnant after an operative procedure), and medical treatment with somatostatin in another case (3.8%) with excellent clinical results. In conclusion, conservative treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts has good clinical results, but it is not always indicated. Surgical drainage remains the preferred method of treatment.
