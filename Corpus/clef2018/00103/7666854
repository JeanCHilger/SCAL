Role of free radicals on canine bile-induced pancreatitis and effect of superoxide dismutase. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of superoxide dismutase (SOD) on canine experimental pancreatitis. Pancreatitis was induced by retrograde biliary juice injection (0.5 ml/kg) to accessory pancreatic duct. Twenty-one mongrel dogs were divided into two groups, i.e. control (untreated) group (n = 13) and SOD-treated group (n = 8). In SOD-treated group, SOD 5000 units/kg was administered from celiac artery immediately after onset of pancreatitis. Xanthine oxidase (XOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), phospholipase (PL), and SOD were assayed from pancreatic tissue 1 and 3 hours after onset of pancreatitis. Serum amylase, elastase I, calcium, and WBC were assayed for 7 days after onset of pancreatitis. XOD and MDA levels were increased in untreated group, and not significantly changed in treated group with statistical difference. PL levels were increased after onset of pancreatitis in both groups and SOD levels were not changed even in treated group. No statistical difference was seen in PL and SOD levels between two groups. Increase of XOD levels suggests continuous generating of free radical species from pancreatic tissue, and SOD inhibits this increase. Increase of PL level was not improved by SOD. Serum laboratory findings and survival rates were not improved by SOD treatment.
