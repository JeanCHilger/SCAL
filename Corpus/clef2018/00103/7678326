Different effects of hyperstimulation by similar classes of secretagogues on the exocrine pancreas. Cholecystokinin and its analogues such as cerulein, muscarinic cholinergic agonists, and gastrin-releasing peptide (bombesin) bind to distinct receptors on the surface of pancreatic acinar cells and stimulate digestive protein secretion by a calcium-dependent mechanism. The mechanisms of the calcium-dependent secretagogue classes has been assumed to be similar. In this study we have noted that dispersed pancreatic acini secrete comparable maximal rates of amylase in response to cerulein and bombesin however, the maximal level of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis was less with bombesin than with cerulein. The high agonist dose-inhibited secretion in vitro observed with cerulein was absent with bombesin. In vivo administration of supramaximal secretory stimulating doses of both cerulein and bombesin caused pancreatic edema
