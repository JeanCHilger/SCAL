Effect of camostate administration for two weeks on experimental pancreatitis in mice and rats. The present study investigates the effect of oral pretreatment with the protease inhibitor camostate on the outcome of pancreatitis in three experimental models. In pancreatitis induced by overstimulation with cholecystokinin (CCK) in rats, pancreatic enzymes and the histological degree of pancreatitis were quantified in pancreatitis induced by a choline-deficient ethionine-supplemented (CDE) diet in mice, the effect on survival was monitored
