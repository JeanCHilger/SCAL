Changes of systemic prostacyclin and thromboxane A2 in sodium taurocholate- and cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in rats. Systemic prostacyclin and thromboxane A2 production in rat experimental acute pancreatitis has been evaluated by measuring the urinary excretion of the 2,3-dinor 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha and 2,3-dinor thromboxane B2, respectively. Acute pancreatitis was induced by intraductal administration of 4.5% sodium taurocholate (0.1 ml/100 mg body weight) and intravenous cerulein perfusion (5 micrograms/kg/hr) for 6 hr, respectively. Urinary excretion of 2,3-dinor 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha and 2,3-dinor thromboxane B2 were much more important in sodium taurocholate- than in cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis. These data confirm an altered prostacyclin and thromboxane metabolism occurring in experimental acute pancreatitis. Phospholipase A2 activity and the effect of gabexate mesilate on the arachidonate metabolism were also evaluated.
