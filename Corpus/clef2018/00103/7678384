Pancreatic tissue damage by transcatheter arterial embolization for hepatoma. We analyzed the serial changes in serum pancreatic enzyme activities by transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) in 20 hepatoma patients with liver cirrhosis in an attempt to evaluate the incidence of the pancreatic tissue damage by TAE. Serum amylase activities increased in two (10%) cases, elastase 1 levels in six (30%) cases, and trypsin and pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (PSTI) levels in each of five (25%) cases. Consequently, TAE resulted in the elevation of at least more than one serum pancreatic enzyme in eight (40%) of 20 cases, although none had clinical symptoms related to pancreatitis. When the adverse effect on the pancreatic tissue was compared among 6 cases of the superselective TAE and 14 cases of the nonsuperselective TAE, which were performed from the segmental and the nonsegmental hepatic arteries, respectively, the elevation of serum pancreatic enzymes was caused only by nonsuperselective TAE, not by superselective TAE. The volumes of Spongel and Lipiodol used or the injected doses of the anticancer agent mitomycin C were not different between the two groups. These results indicate that TAE for the treatment of hepatoma frequently causes pancreatic tissue damage, and the position of the inserted catheter tip is very important to avoid the pancreatic tissue damage by TAE.
