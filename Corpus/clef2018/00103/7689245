The influence of early total parenteral nutrition on experimental pancreatitis in rats. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of early total parenteral nutrition on acute sodium-taurocholate-induced pancreatitis in rats. Total parenteral nutrition did not change the survival rate, serum amylase, calcium or liver transaminase level on the degree of pancreatic damage, but reduced serum acid phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase levels. Hyperglycemia occurred during the use of total parenteral nutrition. Total parenteral nutrition is not harmful in the course of acute experimental pancreatitis, and could be used with few side effects.
