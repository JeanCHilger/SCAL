Acute pancreatitis with formation of a pancreatic pseudocyst in a six-month-old female infant. Acute pancreatitis and pancreas pseudocysts are rare events in children. We report an infant aged six months with the cardinal symptoms of abdominal pain, vomiting and fever. After the exclusion of an acute abdominal emergency conservative therapy was started. Due to the persistence of the symptoms an explorative laparatomy had to be done on day four of the illness. A postoperative seen fistula of the pancreas was successfully closed by a sandostatin therapy.
