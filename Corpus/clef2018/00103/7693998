Role of pancreatic blood flow and vasoactive substances in the development of canine acute pancreatitis. To study the role of pancreatic blood flow and vasoactive substances in the development of acute pancreatitis, we measured portal vein blood levels of bradykinin, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), histamine, serotonin, and pancreatic enzymes, and with an electromagnetic blood flowmeter we recorded gastroduodenal arterial flow (GDAF), superior mesenteric arterial flow (SMAF), and mean arterial blood pressure for 6 hr in dogs with acute hemorrhagic necrotizing pancreatitis induced by the retrograde injection of autologous bile (0.5 ml/kg) into the pancreatic duct. GDAF and SMAF decreased immediately in the early phase of acute pancreatitis (-17.8 +/- 6.1%** at 10 min and -15.8 +/- 7.1%* at 20 min *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01)
