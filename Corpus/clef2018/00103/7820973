A case of acute idiopathic pandysautonomia complicated with acute pancreatitis and liver injury. A case of acute idiopathic pandysautonomia (AIPD) complicated with acute pancreatitis and liver injury was reported. A 43-year-old woman acutely developed abdominal pain, low grade fever, lymphoadenopathy and generalized erythema in May 1992. She was found to have autonomic dysfunctions, such as orthostatic hypotension, hypohidrosis, paralytic ileus and urinary retention. A systematic investigation of autonomic function revealed an impairment of both sympathetic and parasympathetic post-ganglionic nerves. Serum concentrations of amylase, lipase, elastase 1, and transaminase and amylase creatinine clearance ratio were elevated in the early stage of the disease. No significant serological findings for viral infections were detected to suggest any special etiology of the disease the symptoms gradually improved, although incompletely, after several months from the onset. AIPD complicated with acute pancreatitis or liver injury is uncommon. A possible link between undetectable viral infection and AIPD was discussed.
