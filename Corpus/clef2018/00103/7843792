Prostanoid generation in early stages of acute pancreatitis: a role for nitric oxide. The role of nitric oxide in eicosanoid and oxygen-free radical production in the early stages of sodium taurocholate-induced acute necrotizing pancreatitis has been studied. Male Wistar rats were divided into three groups: group I: control group, a volume of 0.1 ml/100 g body wt saline solution was injected at low pressure in the pancreatic duct group II: acute pancreatitis was induced by administration of 3.5% sodium taurocholate
