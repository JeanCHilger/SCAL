Bifid pancreas. An unusual anomaly associated with acute pancreatitis. Pancreatic divisum and the ectopic pancreas are well-known anatomic anomalies. However, the bifid pancreatic duct is less common and is still poorly understood. The present case report examines this anatomic variant. We observed a bifid pancreatic duct in an elderly man with abdominal pain and an elevated level of serum amylase. An endoscopic papillotomy resulted in clinical improvement.
