Post-ERCP pancreatitis: randomized, prospective study comparing a low- and high-osmolality contrast agent. Diagnostic and therapeutic ERCPs are complicated by pancreatitis in 1% to 10% of patients, and evidence suggests that the contrast agent used for ERCP may be important in the pathogenesis of such pancreatitis. This prospective, double-blind study was undertaken to determine whether the use of a low-osmolality, nonionic contrast agent (Omnipaque 300 iohexol, 672 mOsm/kg H2O) would reduce the frequency and severity of postprocedure pancreatitis as compared to a high-osmolality, ionic contrast agent (Hypaque 50%
