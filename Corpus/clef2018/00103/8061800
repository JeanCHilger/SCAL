Serum levels of interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-6 in patients with chronic pancreatitis. To investigate the role played by cytokines in chronic pancreatitis, we examined serum levels of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 33 patients with definitively diagnosed chronic pancreatitis. All the patients, who had received either no treatment or only digestive enzyme products for their chronic pancreatitis, had significantly elevated serum IL-1 beta levels (38.5 +/- 28.8 pg/ml, mean +/- SD), compared to normal controls (16.0 +/- 6.7 pg/ml P < 0.01)
