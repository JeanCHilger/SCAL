Benign chondroma of the pancreas. Fragments of a puncture cylinder were obtained from a pancreas tumour, using the ultrasound-guided fine-needle puncture. The tumour appears as an echo-poor, homogeneous structure suggesting good delineation against the adjoining tissue. Histological examination of the punch cylinder revealed a chondroma of the pancreas. Clinical and clinical pathology examinations (lipase, alpha-amylase, glucose, CEA, CA 19-9 in serum) were inconspicuous. Chondroma of the pancreas does not require specific treatment.
