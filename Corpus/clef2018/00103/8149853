Glutathione and ATP levels, subcellular distribution of enzymes, and permeability of duct system in rabbit pancreas following intravenous administration of alcohol and cerulein. In order to reproduce what might occur during the initial phase in some cases of acute alcohol-induced pancreatitis, rabbits were infused with diluted ethanol and low-dose cerulein. The duct permeability was assessed by recovery of fluoresceinated dextran (molecular weight 19,500) in central venous blood following orthograde duct perfusion with this substance in the anesthetized animal. Serum ethanol, lipase, and amylase were measured pancreatic duct morphology was examined by light microscopy and electron microscopy. ATP and glutathione were measured, as were amylase, trypsinogen/trypsin, cathepsin B, and DNA levels in differential centrifugates. As expected, acinar amylase and trypsinogen showed a significant decrease in the experimental group
