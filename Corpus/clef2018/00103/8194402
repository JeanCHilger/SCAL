Trypsinogen activation peptides in acute pancreatitis. Experimental data and clinical implications. Trypsinogen activation peptides (TAP) can be found in patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) as well as in different models of experimental AP. First experience has suggested that early elevation of TAP indicates development of necrotizing AP and that the amount of TAP correlates with the extent of acinar cell necrosis and mortality. It is however unknown whether TAP similarly assess severity of AP in the later course of the disease. The present study monitores TAP in plasma, urine and ascites during the initial development of pancreatic injury and correlates the amount of TAP and the extent of pancreatic necrosis over 48 h in a rodent model of AP. While there was no elevation of TAP in control animals or animals with edemantous AP, significant amounts of TAP im plasma were found as early as 30 min following induction of severe necrotizing AP. Serum amylase returned to normal values within 24 h, TAP maintained at high levels until the end of the 48 h observation period. During the first 24 h TAP paralleled the development of acinar cell necrosis, but decreased thereafter despite further progression of pancreatic injury. Our results provide further evidence suggesting that TAP initially precede morphological changes in AP. Early in the course of the disease TAP parallel development of pancreatic injury.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
