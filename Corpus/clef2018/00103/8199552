Traumatic pancreatitis in a patient with pancreas divisum: clinical and radiographic features. A previously healthy patient with chronic hyperamylasemia and epigastric pain following blunt abdominal trauma complicated by retroperitoneal hematoma is reported. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographic and computerized tomographic examinations revealed pancreatographic characteristics of pancreas divisum with traumatic disruption of the duct of Santorini and adjacent pseudocyst formation. Distal pancreatectomy with cystjejunostomy resulted in total recovery. This represents the first documented case of traumatic pancreatitis in a patient with pancreas divisum.
