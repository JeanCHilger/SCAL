Acute pancreatitis caused by foreign bodies. 2 cases. We report the cases of two patients with acute pancreatitis caused by the insertion of foreign bodies in the ampulla of Vater: vegetal residues in the first case and beltbuckle in the second case. The acute pancreatitis was revealed by severe epigastric pain, jaundice and a serum amylase increase to more than 9 times the upper limit of normal level. The presence of foreign bodies was detected by endoscopic retrograde cholangiography and pancreatography in the first case and by abdominal X-ray examination in the second case. Extraction of vegetal residues was performed by endoscopic route whereas that of the beltbuckle required surgery. From these 2 cases and 8 others previously reported cases, the clinical features and course of acute pancreatitis caused by foreign bodies have been analysed.
