Effect of prostaglandin E2 on cellular, lysosomal and mitochondrial fragility in caerulein-induced pancreatitis in rats. The effects of prostaglandin E2 on the fragility of cellular and subcellular organelles in caerulein-induced acute pancreatitis were investigated in rats. PGE2 at doses of 50 and 100 micrograms/kg/hr infused for 2 hours before and during caerulein (5 micrograms/kg/hr for 3.5 hours) infusion significantly prevented the increased discharge of both amylase and lactate dehydrogenase from dispersed acini, and the leakage of cathepsin B from lysosomes and of malate dehydrogenase from mitochondria in the subcellular fraction in vitro. These results suggest that PGE2 has a cytoprotective effect against caerulein-induced pancreatitis by stabilizing cell and lysosomal and mitochondrial membranes.
