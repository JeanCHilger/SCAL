Acute murine cytomegalovirus infection induces lethal hepatitis. Events were examined that might contribute to mortality in acute murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection after intraperitoneal inoculation. Specifically, viral replication in the liver, spleen, and pancreas and the concomitant biochemical abnormalities induced by MCMV during lethal and nonlethal acute viral infection were compared. Mortality was limited to susceptible strains of mice infected by the intraperitoneal (ip) route. In addition, the virus content of the lung, liver, spleen, and pancreas was 100- to 1000-fold greater with lethal infection in the ip-infected group than in those with nonlethal infection. Serum transaminase and lipase levels were markedly elevated in susceptible mice inoculated with MCMV ip. Histopathologic and immunocytochemical changes in the liver, coupled with elevated serum transaminase levels indicating severe hepatitis, appear sufficient to explain the early mortality seen with the ip route of infection.
