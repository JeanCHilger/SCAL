Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and primitive malnutrition. Pancreatic function tests were performed before and after dietary therapy in four patients suffering from primitive malnutrition. Maximal bicarbonate concentrations and lipase activity were the parameters most clearly affected by malnutrition and those showing the fastest recovery following therapy. With reference to this quick recovery it seems unlikely that, at least in Western countries, malnutrition could be a cause of chronic pancreatitis. Interpretation of pancreatic function tests requires an exact knowledge of the nutritional status.
