Acute chemical pancreatitis associated with carbamazepine intoxication. A 5-year-old mentally retarded child developed laboratory evidence of pancreatitis during accidental acute carbamazepine (CBZ) intoxication. He had been seizure-free with CBZ for 4 years for a seizure disorder with no obvious toxicity. CBZ had been discontinued 5 months before he was admitted to the hospital. After he accidentally ingested a CBZ overdose, he was found vomiting and lethargic. Serum amylase and lipase levels were increased for several days. With supportive treatment and no CBZ, he recovered and serum amylase and lipase levels returned to normal. No other causes of pancreatitis were identified. Therefore, most likely the chemical pancreatitis was associated with the acute CBZ intoxication.
