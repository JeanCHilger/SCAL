Free fatty acids in serum of patients with acute necrotizing or edematous pancreatitis. Serum concentrations of free fatty acids (FFA) were assayed in 20 patients with acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP). Pancreatic and peripancreatic fat necrosis was verified on operation and/or by contrast-enhanced computed tomography. For comparison, 20 patients with acute edematous pancreatitis (AEP) were examined. On admission, FFA serum levels were 1.14 +/- 0.12 (SEM) mmol/L in ANP and, thus, significantly (p < 0.03) higher than in AEP (0.78 +/- 0.09 mmol/L). The two groups also differed in the later course: in ANP, the FFA values remained raised (d 5-11:0.86 +/- 0.13 mmol/L p > 0.05 vs day 1), whereas in AEP, the FFA concentrations normalized within 1 wk (d 2-4:0.52 +/- 0.11 mmol/L
