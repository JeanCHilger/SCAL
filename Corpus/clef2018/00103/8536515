Alterations of exocrine pancreas in end-stage renal disease. Do they reflect a clinically relevant uremic pancreopathy? Serum pancreatic enzyme behavior, exocrine function, and morphology of the pancreas were studied in 28 patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing regular hemodialysis, in order to better delineate and assess the clinical relevance of the pancreatic alterations that occur in these patients. Twenty-eight healthy subjects served as controls. Initial studies included serum amylase, isoamylase, and lipase assays fecal chymotrypsin measurement
