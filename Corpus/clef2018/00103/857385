Value of thermal fractionation of lactate dehydrogenase and the protein composition of the blood in the differential diagnosis of the phases of acute pancreatitis. Under examination were seventy nine patients with acute pancreatitis (23 patients with edematous form and 56 - with necrotic one). To test the method of thermal fractionation the studies were conducted in patients with hepatic lesions (the Botkin disease - 15 patients, hepatic cirrhosis - 15 patients). The most pronounced shifts were found in destructive processes in the pancreas, whereas no significant changes were noted in edematous form of acute pancreatitis. In necrotic pancreatitis structural changes in the liver were observed. The employed methods of investigation can prove to be useful for estimation of acute pancreatitis phases and the degree of liver involvement in the inflammatory process.
