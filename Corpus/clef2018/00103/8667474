Acute pancreatitis following organophosphate intoxication. Acute pancreatitis as a complication of organophosphate intoxication has been infrequently addressed. Previous reports have suggested that acute pancreatitis may follow the oral ingestion of several organophosphates, including parathion, malathion, difonate, coumaphos, and diazinon, or after cutaneous exposure to dimethoate. No cases of acute pancreatitis following mevinphos (CAS 7786-34-71) poisoning have been reported to date. The possible pathogeneses of the pancreatic insult in organophosphate intoxication are excessive cholinergic stimulation of the pancreas and ductular hypertension.We describe a patient presenting with painless acute pancreatitis following an intentional ingestion of large amounts of mevinphos. Serum amylase and lipase values were increased and determination of amylase isoenzymes confirmed a pancreatic origin. A computerized tomograph of the abdomen showed diffuse swelling of the pancreas. The patient was discharged after a seven week clinical course, complicated by a delayed neuropathy.As acute pancreatitis in organophosphate intoxication may be more common than reported, serum pancreatic enzymes and appropriate imaging studies should be more liberally utilized. Early recognition and appropriate therapy for acute pancreatitis may lead to an improved prognosis.
