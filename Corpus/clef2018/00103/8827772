Exocrine pancreatic alterations in long-lived surviving cystic fibrosis mice. We investigated the development of the exocrine pancreas in Cftr-/- mice in comparison with age-matched littermates (Cftr+/+, Cftr+/-) up to 100 d postnatally. Controls were weaned either to mouse chow or a liquid diet Cftr-/- mice were weaned solely to a liquid diet. Solid-fed control mice gained weight and showed a progressive increase in pancreatic protein, DNA, amylase, lipase, trypsin, and chymotrypsin activities. Liquid-fed control mice showed similar postnatal somatic and pancreatic growth, except that amylase and lipase activities were lower than in the solid-fed controls. Cftr-/- mice exhibited significantly lower body and pancreatic weights than did controls. Pancreatic protein content and enzyme activities (notably amylase and lipase) were consistently lower than in the age-matched litter-mates fed either diet. The reduction in lipase activity in Cftr-/- mice was noted before weaning. We concluded that the liquid diet influenced postnatal exocrine pancreatic development in mice. However, a further reduction in postnatal pancreatic growth and enzymatic activities in the Cftr-/- mice was noted. These alterations could be due to the primary cystic fibrosis defect, although secondary factors, such as malnutrition induced by decreased dietary intake or abnormal absorptive capacity, may be responsible.
