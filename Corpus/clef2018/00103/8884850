Effects of a bradykinin receptor antagonist (HOE140) on taurocholate-induced acute pancreatitis in rats. The effect of a potent and long-acting bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist (HOE140) on acute pancreatitis induced by retrograde infusion of trypsin and taurocholate into the pancreatic duct was studied in rats. HOE140 was administered subcutaneously immediately before and 3 h after the induction of pancreatitis and the systemic blood pressure, ascites volume, serum amylase, 24-h survival rate, and pathology of the pancreas were evaluated. Plasma concentrations of bradykinin increased significantly 15 min after the induction of pancreatitis and decreased to basal levels at 90 min. HOE140 (0.1 mg/kg) alleviated hypotension developing immediately after the induction of pancreatitis and reduced the ascites volume. The 24-h survival rate in rats treated with 0.1 mg/kg HOE140 (70.3%) was significantly higher than that in controls (35.6%). Treatment with 0.01, 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg of HOE140, however, had no beneficial effect on the survival rate. Ascites volume, serum amylase, and pathology of the pancreas at 24 h were not improved by treatment with HOE140. These data suggest that HOE140 may improve the survival rate by maintaining hemodynamics in the early stage of experimental acute pancreatitis.
