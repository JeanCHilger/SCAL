Measurement of pancreatic blood flow with the intraductal electrode method of the hydrogen clearance technique in acute pancreatitis in rats. Measurement of local pancreatic blood flow during acute pancreatitis is thought of as being technically difficult in smaller animals. In this study, we first employed an intraductal electrode method of the hydrogen clearance technique for measurement of changes in local pancreatic blood flow in two types of acute pancreatitis in rats, then compared this method with an interstitial electrode method that has been used in rats. There was a very close correlation between these methods (r = 0.998, p < 0.001). The intraductal electrode method was easily performed and caused minimal tissue damage.
