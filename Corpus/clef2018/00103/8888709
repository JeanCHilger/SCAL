Chylous cardiac tamponade in acute pancreatitis. A 47-year-old woman with acute necrotizing pancreatitis developed sudden cardiorespiratory arrest and needed resuscitation. A pericardial effusion was found, and 350 ml of a white nontransparent milky fluid was aspirated that contained 1020 mg triglycerides/100 ml. The diagnosis of chylous cardiac tamponade was made. Absence of amylase in the chylous effusion militates against the popular hypothesis that lymphatic transport of exocrine digestive enzymes from the inflamed pancreas produces the frequent intrathoracic serosal effusions in acute pancreatitis. The data of our patient rather suggest that these effusions result from the leakage of pancreatic inflammatory exudates through the diaphragm which, apparently, may even result in the loss of pericardial and adjacent thoracic lymph vessel integrity. Although pericardial tamponade is a rare complication, it should be considered if otherwise unexplained circulatory deterioration occurs in a patient with acute pancreatitis.
