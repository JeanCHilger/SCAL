Duct obstruction with an acrylate glue for treatment of chronic alcoholic pancreatitis. Six patients have been treated for chronic alcoholic pancreatitis by total obstruction of the pancreatic duct. In each instance the pancreatic duct was of near normal calibre, and any other procedure would have involved pancreatic resection. There has been little morbidity, and three of six cases have had complete pain relief.
