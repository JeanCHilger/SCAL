Role of apoptosis in duct obstruction-induced pancreatic involution in rats. It has been recognized in mammals that after pancreatic duct obstruction, acinar cells progressively disappear and pancreatic islets are preserved. Previous studies by electron microscopy have suggested the involvement of apoptosis in acinar cell deletion. In the present study, we employed molecular biological methods and investigated whether acinar cell deletion is due to apoptosis. In male Sprague-Dawley rats, pancreatic duct ligation was performed through a left paramedian incision. Pancreatic tissue was studied at each of the following intervals after ligation: 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h and 2, 3, 5, and 7 days. DNA fragmentation was determined by in situ labeling of DNA strand breaks on tissue sections [fluorescein-labeled terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling method (TUNEL)] and by electrophoretic detection of the fragments of extracted DNA. Tissue sections were also examined by hematoxylin/eosin staining and immunohistochemical staining of insulin. Pancreatic duct ligation induced acinar cell deletion by day 5. Pancreatic tissue from control rats demonstrated no TUNEL-positive nuclei. In contrast, acinar cells from rats 12 h to 5 days after duct ligation showed TUNEL-positive nuclei. The number of TUNEL-positive nuclei was maximum 2 days after duct ligation. Electrophoresis showed DNA fragmentation after duct ligation. Control rats showed a genomic DNA pattern. Islets were preserved throughout the experimental period in duct-ligated rats and control rats. The results suggest that apoptosis may be the dominant form of acinar cell death in the rat pancreatic duct ligation model.
