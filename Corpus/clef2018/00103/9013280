Pancreatic exocrine function during acute exacerbation in WBN/Kob rats with spontaneous chronic pancreatitis. Pancreatic exocrine hypofunction is markedly deteriorated during acute exacerbation in a rat model with chronic pancreatitis.Little is known about pancreatic exocrine function during acute exacerbation in patients with chronic pancreatitis. We investigated changes in pancreatic exocrine function after inducing acute pancreatitis in an animal model of spontaneous chronic pancreatitis.WBN/Kob rats with chronic pancreatitis sequentially underwent pancreatic exocrine function test 1-6 d after surgical preparation with external pancreatic fistula. We induced acute pancreatitis in another WBN/Kob rats by i.v. administration of cerulein at a rate of 10 micrograms/kg/h for 4 h 4 d after surgical preparation. Pancreatic exocrine function test was undertaken in a conscious state 1 d before and after cerulein administration.In WBN/Kob rats not given cerulein, pancreatic exocrine function remained almost constant at 3-6 d after surgery. Marked hyperamylasemia developed immediately after cerulein administration. After its administration, the pancreas microscopically showed prominent interstitial edema and intracellular vacuolization of acinar cells in addition to the finding of pre-existing chronic pancreatitis. Basal and cholecystokinin-stimulated flow rate, bicarbonate output, and protein output, which were substantially impaired 1 d before cerulein administration, were further reduced 1 d after its administration.
