The soluble interleukin-2 receptor, peripheral blood, and reticulocyte fractions in acute pancreatitis. In acute pancreatitis (AP), the peripheral blood analysis, including reticulocytes (RC) and RC fractions, and its relationship to the changes of the levels of the soluble interleukin 2 receptor (sIL-2R) can provide useful information about the involvement of the immunoinflammatory system in AP and can indicate the severity of the disease.In the disease clinical assessment, we correlated the sIL-2R serum levels to the peripheral blood components (including RC and RC fractions) to serum albumin and C-reactive protein (CRP) during AP.In 21 patients with AP, sIL-2R, the total and differential white blood cell (WBC) counts, red blood cell (RBC) counts, RC, RC fractions, hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Ht), platelets (PLT), albumin, and CRP were evaluated from the onset to the sixth day of illness.sIL-2R increased in all the patients. The increase was directly related to eosinophils, monocytes, and to middle-aged (MFR) RC, and inversely related to neutrophils and the old (LFR) RC. MFR-RC were directly related to the total WBC count, eosinophils, and basophils, and inversely related to Hb and albumin. LFR-RC behaved in the opposite manner. CRP increased in 16 patients this rise was directly related to WBC, RC, and MFR-RC, and inversely related to Hb, LFR-RC, and albumin. sIL-2R and CRP values were not statistically interrelated, but when the CRP levels were higher, the increase in sIL-2R was greater and more sustained.
