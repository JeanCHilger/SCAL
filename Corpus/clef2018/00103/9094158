Effects of green tea catechins (Polyphenon 100) on cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in rats. Effects of green tea catechins (GTC) on cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in rats were examined. The acute pancreatitis induced by cerulein (cerulein pancreatitis) was characterized by interstitial edema and vacuolation. When cerulein pancreatitis was induced, prior administration of 0.1% GTC in drinking water for 1 week before the induction significantly decreased the wet weight of the pancreas, the serum level of amylase, and the tissue concentration of lipid peroxides in the pancreas compared with those in nonmedicated rats supplied with plain tap water only. Furthermore, the pancreatic tissue alterations of the medicated rats were milder than those of the nonmedicated rats. These data suggest that GTC have a protective effect on the pathogenesis of cerulein pancreatitis.
