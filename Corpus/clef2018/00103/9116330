The effect of prostacyclin analogue--iloprost on the pancreas regeneration after caerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in rats. Prostacyclin (PGI2) and its stable analogue iloprost (I) exert beneficial effect in acute pancreatitis (AP). The aim of the study was to evaluate the role of iloprost in pancreas regeneration after AP in rats.AP was induced in male Wistar rats by s.c. injections of caerulein 12 micrograms/kg t.i.d. for 2 days. Rats were divided into four groups: control + saline (C) control + iloprost (C/I)Acute pancreatitis resulted in pancreas destruction observed even 7 days after the onset of the disease. The significant decrease of pancreatic weight, RNA and chymotrypsin contents were observed in AP rats when compared to C. The improvement of pancreatic histology and significant increase of DNA content were found in I treated (during 7 days) AP rats in comparison to untreated AP group. Two weeks after pancreatitis induction the pancreas regeneration occurred in both pancreatitis groups and it was connected with pancreas hypertrophy. Treatment with I resulted in slight not significant increase of some of cellular hypertrophy indices when compared to AP untreated animals. Healthy rats injected with I during 7 days showed significant elevation of DNA content in comparison to C. When treatment with I was prolonged up to 14 days such hyperplastic effect was not observed. Our results suggest, that treatment with iloprost exerts temporary hyperplastic influence on the pancreas of healthy rats and pancreas regenerating after caerulein-induced pancreatitis.
