Hereditary pancreatitis and familial pancreatic cancer. Important advances in the understanding of pancreatic diseases have taken place through the application of molecular methods in the study of the inherited form of pancreatitis and pancreas cancer. Mutations of the cationic trypsinogen gene have been found to be causative for hereditary pancreatitis with important implications for the molecular pathogenesis of acute and chronic pancreatitis. A variety of cancer syndromes involving the P16 and BRCA2 genes, for example, also lead to pancreatic cancer, but the gene responsible for familial pancreatic cancer has not been identified so far. The establishment of a European Registry of Hereditary Pancreatitis and Pancreatic Cancer (EUROPAC) will facilitate future developments.
