Induction of apoptosis in pancreatic acinar cells reduces the severity of acute pancreatitis. 1-Cyano-2-hydroxy-3-butene (CHB) has been reported to cause cell death in rat pancreatic acini. In this report, we describe the time-dependent effects of CHB on mouse acinar cell apoptosis and the effects of CHB-induced acinar cell apoptosis on the severity of secretagogue-induced acute pancreatitis in mice. CHB administration to mice resulted in a time-dependent increase in pancreatic apoptosis, which was maximal 12 hours after CHB administration. The severity of pancreatitis was significantly reduced by prior CHB administration and maximal protection was observed when the caerulein injections were started 12 hours after CHB administration. These observations indicate that induction of apoptosis can reduce the severity of pancreatitis and they suggest that induction of pancreatic acinar cell apoptosis may be beneficial in the clinical management of acute pancreatitis.
