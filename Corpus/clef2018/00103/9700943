The clinical value of human pancreas-specific protein procarboxypeptidase B as an indicator of necrosis in acute pancreatitis: comparison to CRP and LDH. Early assessment of severity in acute pancreatitis (AP) has a major impact on further treatment. Previous studies have shown that human pancreas-specific protein (hPASP)/procarboxypeptidase B (PCPB) is a new diagnostic and prognostic marker in AP. In the present study we focused on the prognostic properties of this parameter and analyzed the clinical value of hPASP in discriminating edematous from necrotizing AP. The results were compared to those for C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). A total of 70 patients was enrolled in this prospective study. Based on contrast-enhanced computed tomography or intraoperative results, 39 patients (27 male, 12 female median age, 42 years
