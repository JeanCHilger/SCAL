Spontaneous pseudocystogastrostomy associated with pancreatitis. Detection by endoscopy. A pseudocystogastrostomy complicating the course of acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis was detected by upper endoscopy. Aspiration of the cyst contents during endoscopy showed greatly elevated amylase values confirming the diagnosis. Peritoneal lavage therapy was used in the acute phase of the patient's illness with dramatic clearing of the peritoneal fluid, reduction of ascitic fluid amylase values, and subjective clinical improvement.
