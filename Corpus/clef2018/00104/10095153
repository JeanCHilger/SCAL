Continuous intravenous octreotide treatment for acute experimental pancreatitis. The efficacy of octreotide, the synthetic analogue of the hormone somatostatin, for the treatment of acute pancreatitis is controversial. Octreotide has been commonly administered in subcutaneous bolus injections however, continuous intravenous infusion may be advantageous for acute conditions.Acute experimental pancreatitis was induced in rats by intraparenchymal injections of 1 ml 10% sodium taurocholate, and octreotide (1 microg/kg/h, dissolved in physiological solution, intravenously was started 4 h later and continuously infused for 48 h. Physiological solution infusions, in identical volumes, were used in the controls. The following parameters were examined: mortality macroscopic and histological damageOctreotide treatment had a striking effect on mortality: 8.3 versus 91.6% in the treatment and control groups, respectively (p < 0.001). Octreotide also ameliorated pancreatic edema and intestinal dilatation, and had significant beneficial effects on histopathological damage and the biochemical alterations which are associated with acute pancreatitis.Continuous intravenous octreotide infusion is a potentially efficacious therapeutic method for acute pancreatitis.
