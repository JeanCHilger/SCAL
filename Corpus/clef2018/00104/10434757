A case of systemic lupus erythematosus associated with severe acute pancreatitis. A 22-year-old woman began to have the symptoms of anorexia, high fever, cough and general fatigue from June of 1997. She was admitted in our hospital on Aug. 8th, 1997 for the further detail examination because of pancytopenia and positive antinuclear antibody (ANA). Her laboratory findings and clinical symptoms were compatible with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) such as leukopenia, proteinuria, hypocomplementemia, positive ANA, elevated titer of autoantibodies including anti-DNA, anti-Sm, anti-RNP antibodies, polyarthralgia and photosensitivity. The administration of oral prednisolone (40 mg/day) was started on Aug. 15th, 1997 under the diagnosis of SLE. However, she had severe abdominal pain in epigastrium with elevated serum amylase, ascites and dull shape of pancreas tail by CT scan compatible with acute pancreatitis. On Aug. 18th, her general condition was worsening with fever, epigastralgia, abdominal distension, anemia, weak palpation of radial artery, hypotension, tachycardia, shallow breathing and cold sensation on both extremities as shock. In spite of steroid pulse therapy with nafamostat mesilate intraarterial infusion, her condition was not improved. The dose of 50 mg/day of cyclophosphamide was added to the regimen on Aug. 22nd. Then, gradually her condition started to be restored. Anemia, leukopenia, hypocomplementemia continued. Second steroid pulse therapy was done on Sep. 5th. After then, she became better in her clinical symptoms and laboratory data. The dose of PSL was tapered to 15 mg/day and 7.5 mg/day update of Oct. 1998 without the pseudcysts found after pancreatitis. She is a rare case who recovered from severe acute pancreatitis due to SLE itself.
