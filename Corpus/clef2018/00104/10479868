Primary hyperparathyroidism and acute pancreatitis. A rare clinical association. Hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcaemia are considered to be a rare cause of acute pancreatitis. The relationship between hyperparathyroidism and pancreatic inflammatory disease remains controversial, but it may be related to the translation from inactive to active trypsinogen by hypercalcaemia. Surgical correction of parathyroid disease and normalization of serum calcium levels may ameliorate the acute pancreatitis. Also the mechanism of pathologic zymogen activation during acute pancreatitis remain unknown probably the pancreatic "autodigestion" is the result of anomalous intracellular transport of secretory proteins activated by lysosomal hydrolases. A case of acute pancreatitis and hyperparathyroidism due to solitary parathyroid adenoma occurred in a 66-years-old woman is reported. After the excision of parathyroid adenoma the serum calcium levels and the function of the pancreas returned to normal. This suggests a cause and effect relationship between hyperparathyroidism and acute pancreatitis.
