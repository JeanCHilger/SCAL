alpha2-macroglobulin- and murinoglobulin-1- deficient mice. A mouse model for acute pancreatitis. Mice deficient in either or both mouse alpha2-macroglobulin (MAM) and murinoglobulin-1 (MUG1) were generated and proved phenotypically normal under standard conditions. Acute pancreatitis was induced with a diet deficient in choline and methionine, supplemented with ethionine. The mortality was less than 25% in wild-type mice, as opposed to at least 56% in knockout mice, and was highest (70%) in MAM-/- mice, with earliest onset at 2 days. Plasma amylase and lipase levels were increased, but pancreatic tissue appeared histologically variable in individual mice. The clinical symptoms were most severe in MAM-/- mice and, surprisingly, were not aggravated in the double knockout mice, suggesting that the lack of proteinase inhibition capacity was not the major problem. Therefore, we analyzed the expression of 21 different cytokines and polypeptide factors in the pancreas of all experimental groups of mice. Interleukin-1-receptor antagonist mRNA was consistently induced by the diet in the pancreas of MAM-/- mice, and transforming growth factor-beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, tumor necrosis factor-beta, beta-lymphotoxin, and interferon-gamma mRNA levels were also increased. The data demonstrate the important role of alpha2-macroglobulin (A2M) in acute pancreatitis as both a proteinase inhibitor and a cytokine carrier. Mice deficient in MAM and/or MUG thus offer new experimental models for defining in vivo the role of the macroglobulins in pancreatitis and in other normal and pathological processes.
