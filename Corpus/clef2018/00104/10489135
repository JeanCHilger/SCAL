Management of severe acute pancreatitis with a somatostatin analog in a patient undergoing surgery for dissecting thoracic aneurysm: report of a case. A patient who was admitted to our hospital to undergo surgery for a dissecting thoracic aneurysm suffered preoperatively from severe acute pancreatitis with pancreatic pseudocysts. Computerized tomography (CT) demonstrated the presence of new fluid collection around the cyst with the absence of pancreatic necrosis. He was given a somatostatin analog (sandostatin), which was effective in decreasing the abdominal symptoms, leukocyte counts, and the serum C-reactive/protein level. A CT scan revealed that the pancreatic pseudocyst and peripancreatic fluid collection had disappeared. Although somatostatin has been reported to be ineffective for acute pancreatitis with necrosis, pancreatitis without necrosis may regress after treatment with sandostatin. This is probably due to its suppressive effect on the exocrine function, thus resulting in a decrease of pancreatic juice infiltration.
