The recovery of acute pancreatitis depends on the enzyme amount stored in zymogen granules at early stages. Little is known about the changes in pancreatic enzyme storage in acute pancreatitis. We have performed flow cytometric studies of zymogen granules from rats with acute pancreatitis induced by hyperstimulation with caerulein. A comparison was made with rats treated with hydrocortisone (10 mg/kg/day) over 7 days before inducing pancreatitis in order to find out whether the amount of enzymes stored in the pancreas plays a key role in the development of pancreatitis. The potentially therapeutic effect of L-364,718 (0.1 mg/kg/day, for 7 days), a CCK receptor antagonist, was assayed in the rats with caerulein-induced pancreatitis which had previously received the hydrocortisone treatment. A significant increase in the intragranular enzyme content was observed 5 h after hyperstimulation with caerulein. The highest values were reached in the rats previously treated with hydrocortisone. The greatest pancreatic enzyme load was parallel to the highest values in plasma amylase, edema and haematocrit observed. Acute pancreatitis was reversed seven days later. At this stage smaller granules appeared in the pancreas whose enzyme content was similar to that of controls when no treatment was applied after pancreatitis. In contrast, L-364,718 administration prevented the favourable evolution of pancreatitis since the antagonism exerted on CCK receptors induced a blockade of secretion of the large amounts of enzymes stored in the pancreas. Moreover, the enzyme content in zymogen granules was below normal values since the stimulatory CCK action on enzyme synthesis can be inhibited by L-364,718. Our results suggest that the efficiency of CCK antagonists, as potential therapy, would also depend on the load of enzymes in the pancreas when acute pancreatitis is produced.
