CEP-1347 inhibits caerulein-induced rat pancreatic JNK activation and ameliorates caerulein pancreatitis. Pancreatic caerulein-induced activation of c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) has been reported, and JNK has been proposed as a mediator during induction of hyperstimulated pancreatitis. CEP-1347 has recently been described as a specific JNK inhibitor. We tested whether CEP-1347 inhibits caerulein-induced pancreatic JNK activation in isolated acini and in vivo. CEP-1347 dose dependently inhibited acinar caerulein-induced JNK activation with nearly complete inhibition at 2 microM but had no effect on digestive enzyme release. For in vivo studies, rats were pretreated with CEP-1347 before caerulein hyperstimulation. For assessment of JNK activation and histological alterations, animals were killed 30 min or 2 and 4 h after caerulein hyperstimulation, respectively. Pancreatic wet weight, serum enzyme levels, and pancreatic activity of p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) were also determined. Caerulein hyperstimulation strongly activated JNK, p38, and ERK. CEP-1347 pretreatment dose dependently reduced caerulein-induced pancreatic JNK activation without p38 or ERK inhibition. JNK inhibition also reduced pancreatic edema formation and reduced histological severity of pancreatitis. Thus we show that CEP-1347 inhibits JNK activation in vivo and ameliorates caerulein-induced pancreatitis.
