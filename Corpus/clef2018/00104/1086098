Radioimmunoassay of human plasma trypsin. A radioimmunoassay has been developed for the determination of human trypsin (3.4.21.4) in plasma. It allows the measurement of trypsin concentration in spite of the presence of plasma or pancreatic inhibitors. The human trypsin used as a standard and for labelling was isolated from pancreatic tissue and purified by affinity chromatography. The antiserum was obtained from guinea-pigs immunized with partially purified human trypsin. In the radioimmunoassay, the values of trypsin in serial dilutions of plasma were parallel to those of the standard curves. The assay was shown to be reproducible, sensitive and specific. However, the two antisera used did not distinguish between the enzyme and its proenzyme. In normal subjects, plasma values were found to be around 400 ng/ml. They were 10-40 times higher in patients with acute pancreatitis. The method appears to be much more specific for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis than the current determinations of amylase and lipase activity.
