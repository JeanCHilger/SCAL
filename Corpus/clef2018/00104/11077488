Acute pancreatitis--clinical and technical laboratory diagnostic and prognostic assessment. The incidence of acute pancreatitis within 100,000 inhabitants a year differs between 5 (Bristol) and 80 (USA). Even though the diagnosis of pancreatitis has become easier by the measurement of specific pancreatic enzymes there are still 30-40% of the fatal cases which are first diagnosed at autopsy. It is of utmost importance to assess the diagnosis and the severity of acute pancreatitis in the beginning to identify those patients with severe or necrotising disease who benefit from an early initiated intensive care therapy. Additionally, in view of new therapeutical concepts (e.g. antibiotic therapy in severe forms) and for the evaluation of new drugs, patients should be staged into mild and severe disease as early as possible. In most cases it is not possible to assess the severity clinically on hospital admission. Up to now the "gold standard" are imaging procedures (contrast-enhanced CT and MRI) which should be reserved for the severe cases to estimate the extent of pancreatic necrosis. The ideal predictor in blood or in urine should be objective, reliable, inexpensive, easy to measure, widely available, sensitive and specific. There are a variety of mediators of the "systemic inflammatory response syndrome" which are elevated in this disease (C-reactive protein, antiproteases, enzyme activation peptides like trypsinogen activation peptide (TAP) and carboxypeptidase B activation peptide (CAPAP), PMN-elastase, complement factors, chemokines and interleukins and others). Among all these mediators, C-reactive protein is the parameter best analysed. It has to be taken into account that it is not specific for AP and it's highest efficacy is reached after > 48 hours after the onset of disease. However, because usually a certain time elapses (approximately 24-48 hours) until patients are hospitalised the time delay seems not to a major disadvantage.
