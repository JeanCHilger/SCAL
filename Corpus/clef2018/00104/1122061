Acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis in the dog. 3. The effect of antidiuretic hormone on pancreatic tissue and body fluids. Antidiuretic hormone had a marked effect on the microscopic anatomy of the pancreas and the duodenum subjected to a closed duodenal loop obstruction. In contrast to the acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis usually seen, the pancreas showed only a slight extravasation of red and white blood cells into the connective tissue spaces, some blood vessel engorgement and a slight edema. No tissue disruption of the pancreas was observed. The appearance of the closed loops were also modified by the antidiuretic hormone. These closed loops contained small amounts of fluid with little odor and the duodenal villi showed little or no necrosis. Antidiuretic hormone also reduced the amylase concentration and the fluid volume in the peritoneal cavity and in the closed duodenal loop.
