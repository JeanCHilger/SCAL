A comparison of serum trypsinogen-2 and trypsin-2-alpha1-antitrypsin complex with lipase and amylase in the diagnosis and assessment of severity in the early phase of acute pancreatitis. The aim of the study was to compare the recently introduced laboratory markers trypsinogen-2 and trypsin-2-alpha1 antitrypsin complex (trypsin-2-AAT) in serum with lipase and amylase in the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of patients with acute pancreatitis (AP).The analytes were measured on admission in 64 consecutive patients with AP and in 30 controls with acute abdominal disease of extrapancreatic origin. Twenty-one patients had severe and 43 mild AP. As reference methods we used serum amylase and C-reactive protein.In subjects with AP, elevated trypsinogen-2 values (> or = 90 microg/L) were observed in 63 patients (98%), trypsin-2-AAT values (> or = 12 microg/L) in 64 patients (100%), lipase values (> or = 200 U/L) in 64 patients (100%), and amylase values (> or = 300 IU/L) in 62 patients (97%). The diagnostic accuracy of the markers was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. On admission, trypsinogen-2, trypsin-2-AAT, lipase, and amylase differentiated patients with AP from controls with high accuracy and ROC analyses showed similar areas under the ROC curves (AUC) for trypsinogen-2 (AUC 0.960), trypsin-2-AAT (0.948), lipase (AUC 0.947), and amylase (AUC 0.930). For differentiation between severe and mild AP, trypsin-2-AAT (AUC 0.805) was slightly better than trypsinogen-2 (AUC 0.792), and they were both clearly better than lipase (AUC 0.583), C-reactive protein (AUC 0.519), or amylase (AUC 0.632) (p < 0.05).All the markers studied showed high accuracy for differentiating between AP and extrapancreatic diseases. However, trypsinogen-2 and trypsin-2-AAT displayed the best accuracy for predicting a severe AP already at admission, which makes these markers superior for clinical purposes.
