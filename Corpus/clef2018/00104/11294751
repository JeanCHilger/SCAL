Troglitazone stimulates pancreatic growth in congenitally CCK-A receptor-deficient OLETF rats. We examined the effect of troglitazone treatment on pancreatic growth in the CCK-A receptor-deficient Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima fatty (OLETF) rat, an animal model for type 2 diabetes mellitus. A troglitazone-rich diet (0.2%) was given from 12 to 28 wk of age or from 12 or 28 wk of age to 72 wk of age. Fasting serum glucose concentrations in control OLETF rats increased progressively with age, which was almost completely prevented by troglitazone treatment. Insulin levels in serum and pancreatic content in the control rat markedly increased at 28 wk of age but significantly decreased at 72 wk of age compared with those at 12 wk of age, whereas those in troglitazone-treated rats were nearly the same at all ages and were similar to those in control rats at 12 wk of age. Pancreatic wet weight in control rats decreased with age irrespective of whether they were hyperinsulinemic (28 wk old) or hypoinsulinemic (72 wk old). Troglitazone treatment significantly increased pancreatic wet weight and protein, DNA, and enzyme contents compared with those in the control rats. Moreover, troglitazone treatment completely prevented or reversed histological alterations such as fibrosis, fatty replacement, and inflammatory cell infiltration. Our results indicate that troglitazone stimulates pancreatic growth in the congenitally CCK-A receptor-deficient OLETF rat not only by reducing insulin resistance and potentiating insulin action but also by suppressing inflammatory changes in the pancreas.
