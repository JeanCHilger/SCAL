Amylase clearance in differentiating acute pancreatitis from peptic ulcer with hyperamylasemia. Thirty-four patients with abdominal pain, tenderness, and hyperamylasemia suggesting acute pancreatitis were studied prospectively to elucidate the relationship between peptic ulcer disease and pancreatitis. Confirming evidence of pancreatitis and/or ulcer was obtained either at laparotomy of by upper gastrointestinal roentgenograms. The presence or absence of pancreatitis was substantiated by measurement of the amylase/creatinine clearance ratio, which is significantly higher (p less than 0.001) in patients with acute pancreatitis (9.3 plus or minus 0.9), than in patients without pancreatitis (3.1 plus or minus 0.2). Nine of the 34 patients were found to have gastric or duodenal ulcers. However, seven of the nine, despite an elevated serum amylase, had no sign of pancreatitis at surgery, on radiological examination, or by elevation of the amylase/creatinine clearance ratio (3.1 plus or minus 0.4). It is suggested that hyperamylasemia associated with peptic ulcer disease is most often not indicative of acute pancreatitis and that treatment is most appropriately directed at the ulcer.
