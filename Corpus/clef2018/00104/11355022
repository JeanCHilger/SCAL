Analysis of the human pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (PSTI) gene mutations in Japanese patients with chronic pancreatitis. Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a continuing or relapsing inflammatory disease of the pancreas. Several studies have demonstrated that mutations in the cationic trypsinogen (PRSS1) gene and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene are causative of the pathogenesis in a subset of hereditary and/or idiopathic CP cases. Recently, the N34S alteration of the pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (PSTI) gene has been suggested to be closely associated with the pathogenesis of hereditary and/or idiopathic CP. Herein we analyzed genetic alterations of the PSTI gene in 32 unrelated Japanese CP patients who developed juvenile-onset CP or had a family history of CP 5 patients were found to harbor alterations in this gene. In 3 of these 5 patients, heterozygous N34S alterations were found
