Neutrophil activation and hyperamylasaemia after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography: potential role for the leukocyte in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis. Hyperamylasaemia occurs in up to 60% of patients following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and in a small proportion of patients (1-5%) acute pancreatitis may develop. We evaluated the role of the neutrophil in post-ERCP hyperamylasaemia and acute pancreatitis by measuring circulating CD11b adhesion receptor expression--an indicator of leukocyte activation.A total of 43 patients undergoing elective ERCP were studied. Peripheral blood measurements of amylase activity and neutrophil CD11b content (by flow cytometry) were made immediately before ERCP (baseline), and at 2 and 24 hours after the procedure.ERCP induced an increase in amylase level above baseline in 41 of 43 patients. The 2-hour and 24-hour post-ERCP amylase levels were directly related (R = 0.9, P < 0.01). Baseline CD11b receptor status was positively correlated with post-ERCP amylase activity (R = 0.4, P < 0.05), and this relationship was stronger when pancreatography had been performed (R = 0.67, P < 0.01). Three patients (7%) developed clinical acute pancreatitis, with post-ERCP amylase levels persistently elevated above 1000 IU/l. Multiple linear regression identified CD11b expression as the most significant explanatory variable for amylase level after ERCP (multiple R = 0.74, P < 0.01).The findings from this pilot study indicate an association between neutrophil activation and hyperamylasaemia following ERCP, and suggest a role for this leukocyte in the pathogenesis of pancreatitis. Further study of neutrophil characteristics may allow identification of individual susceptibility to ERCP-induced pancreatic injury.
