Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor administration must be monitored for serum amylase and lipase in order to prevent an acute pancreatitis: a case report. Some clinical cases published in literature show that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor administration may cause acute pancreatitis. In this work, the authors report a case of a patient affected by hypertension. Upon admission, the authors started antihypertensive therapy using captopril, which caused an important amylase and lipase rise within 13 days. When the ACE-inhibitor therapy was stopped, a rapid decrease of the serum enzyme was observed within 3 days. The high levels of serum amylase and lipase were linked to neutrophilia but were not associated with relevant symptomatic findings or features of pancreatopathy. The absence of the usual conditions that may cause pancreatitis, such as biliary stasis, hypercalcemia, or alcohol abuse, and the rapid decrease of serum enzyme levels after drug suspension suggested an ACE-inhibitor-induced pancreatitis. This is the first clinical report of an ACE-inhibitor-induced pancreatitis in which captopril administration was found after hospitalization. The drug suspension probably prevented other complications. This case report suggests that, when ACE-inhibitor administration is started, serum amylase and lipase should be monitored in order to prevent acute pancreatitis without waiting for clinical evidence of a pancreatopathy.
