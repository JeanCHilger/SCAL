Predicting the severity of acute pancreatitis by rapid measurement of trypsinogen-2 in urine. Early identification of patients at risk of developing a severe attack of acute pancreatitis (AP) is of great importance because rapid therapeutic interventions improve outcome. At a cutoff of 50 microg/L, trypsinogen-2 measured by a rapid urinary dipstick is a sensitive and specific diagnostic test in AP. The trypsinogen-2 concentration correlates with the severity of the disease, and a test with a higher cutoff might therefore be useful for prediction of disease severity.We increased the detection limit of the urinary trypsinogen-2 test strip (Actim Pancreatitis) from 50 microg/L to 2000 microg/L and evaluated the prognostic value of this test. The results were compared with those obtained with serum C-reactive protein and the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score. The study population consisted of 150 consecutive patients with AP (42 with severe disease).The sensitivity of the rapid urinary test strip (detection limit, 2000 microg/L) for prediction of severe AP, both on admission and at 24 h, was 62% specificities were 87% and 85%, respectively, positive predictive values were 65% and 62%, and negative predictive values were 85% and 85%. C-Reactive protein had a sensitivity of only 38% on admission, but at 24 h, it was 83%The urinary trypsinogen-2 dipstick is a simple and rapid method for prediction of severe acute pancreatitis.
