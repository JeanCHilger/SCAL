The isolated perfused rat pancreas - an experimental model for investigation the early events in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis. External perfusions of the pancreatic glands of Wistar-rats were done, using a modified Krebs-Ringer-Buffer (KRB). We looked for an elevation of amylase, lipase and lactate-dehydrogenase in the effusion fluid (portal outflow fluid). We investigated a normal perfusion (KRB, 60 minutes), a long term perfusion (KRB, 240 minutes) and a perfusion (60 minutes) including an additive of the detergents triton x-100 or the cholecystokinin analogue ceruletid (10(-8) M).An isolated external perfusion of a rat pancreas is possible without inducing any increase of parameters of damage such as amylase, lipase or lactate-dehydrogenase in the outflow medium. The perfusion time should be limited to 80 minutes including a 20 minutes equilibration period. A damage of pancreatic parenchyma is indicated by increased levels of pancreatic enzymes in the perfusion medium. Such damage can be induced by various noxious substances like detergents or cerulein, which has a significance in the pathophysiology of experimental acute pancreatitis. A significant increase (p < 0.01) of lactate-dehydrogenase, lipase and amylase was found 10, 20 and 30 minutes after an application of triton x-100. During a perfusion with the cholecystokinin analogue ceruletid (10(-8) M) we found an increase of lipase (p < 0.05) after 30 minutes and an increase of amylase (p < 0.05) after 50 minutes perfusion.The isolated perfused rat pancreas is a valuable experimental model to investigate the early phase of pathophysiology in acute pancreatitis.
