Pseudo acute pancreatitis: a syndrome mimicked by a multiple parasitic duodenitis. Analysis of 7 case. The aim of this presentation was to analyze a clinical syndrome characterized by repeated episodes of upper abdominal pain, markedly increased levels of both total amylase and lipase, but with normal values of pancreatic isoamylase. Besides, with the lack of morphologic changes of the pancreatic gland, either by ultrasound, abdominal tomography, or Nuclear Magnetic Resonance.Five female and two male patients, with an average age of 51 +/- 3 were studied. All had been diagnosed as having acute edematous pancreatitis (ranson score < 3). Laboratory tests had disclosed eosinophilia (5-30%) total amylasemia (1547 +/- 398 UA/l)When the fact that all our patients had normal pancreatic isoamylase levels and lack of any morphologic distortion of the pancreatic parenchyma is associated to the notion that total amylase and lipase may have as a source the gastrointestinal mucosa, it appears as a logical inference that the clinical syndrome here discussed is indeed primarily a reflection of an extrapancreatic disease, essentially of parasitic duodenitis.
