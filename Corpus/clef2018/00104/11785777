Does chronic ethanol administration have influence on pancreatic regeneration in the course of caerulein induced acute pancreatitis in rats. This study was undertaken in order to determine the influence of chronic ethanol administration on pancreatic regeneration during acute pancreatitis (AP). Rats were pair fed with isocaloric diet containing or not ethanol. After 8 weeks of such feeding AP was induced by s.c. injection of caerulein (Cae). 6 h, 24 h and 5 days after first Cae dose pancreatic weight, amylase, chymotrypsin, protein, RNA, DNA contents were determined and phosphatidic acid (PA) production in isolated pancreatic acini was measured. Proliferating cells were quantified by immunochemical staining of cells incorporating bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU).Pancreatic weight was significantly higher at 6 h after first Cae injection in both, ethanol fed (EF) and control groups (C), however at 24 h pancreatic weight did not differ from prior to AP induction in EF rats. Ethanol feeding (EF) did not influence significantly protein, chymotrypsin and amylase content in pancreatic tissue in groups with AP. In EF rats RNA content after 5 days of AP was higher than in control animals. Total DNA content in EF rats with AP was lower 6 h after AP induction, earlier than in control animals with AP. Immunochemistry showed higher labelling index for BrdU after 6 h, 24 h and 5 days of AP in EF rats. In contrast to this findings, in EF animals, AP induction was not able to stimulate further PA accumulation.We conclude that chronic ethanol feeding, while inhibiting PA accumulation in comparison to control group, does not impair pancreatic tissue regeneration during the early phase of Cae-induced AP. Stimulation of regenerative/reparative processes in EF rats during Cae-induced AP seems to be even more pronounced than in the control group.
