Soluble thrombomodulin plasma levels are an early indication of a lethal course in human acute pancreatitis. The potential to predict severe disease and lethality by using plasma soluble thrombomodulin (sTM) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in 73 patients with acute pancreatitis was analyzed in a prospective 5-year investigation performed at a single institution.According to the Atlanta criteria, pancreatitis was classified as mild in 23 patients and as severe in 50 patients. Blood was collected on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28 after the onset of pain and analyzed for sTM and CRP.During the period between days 3 and 10 of acute pancreatitis when most of the admissions occurred, sTM levels at a cutoff of 75 ng/mL on day 3 (sensitivity, 100% specificity, 77%CRP is a valuable marker of disease severity in acute pancreatitis especially in the first period of pancreatitis, whereas sTM identifies early those patients with the most severe courses and a high risk of dying (negative predictive value, 100%). Determination of sTM in addition to CRP offers the opportunity of identifying early those patients who require intensive care most urgently. Of course, further investigations of sTM in acute pancreatitis are indicated to confirm our results.
