Cholecystokinin induces caspase activation and mitochondrial dysfunction in pancreatic acinar cells. Roles in cell injury processes of pancreatitis. Apoptosis and necrosis are critical parameters of pancreatitis, the mechanisms of which remain unknown. Many characteristics of pancreatitis can be studied in vitro in pancreatic acini treated with high doses of cholecystokinin (CCK). We show here that CCK stimulates apoptosis and death signaling pathways in rat pancreatic acinar cells, including caspase activation, cytochrome c release, and mitochondrial depolarization. The mitochondrial dysfunction is mediated by upstream caspases (possibly caspase-8) and, in turn, leads to activation of caspase-3. CCK causes mitochondrial alterations through both permeability transition pore-dependent (cytochrome c release) and permeability transition pore-independent (mitochondrial depolarization) mechanisms. Caspase activation and mitochondrial alterations also occur in untreated pancreatic acinar cells however, the underlying mechanisms are different. In particular, caspases protect untreated acinar cells from mitochondrial damage. We found that caspases not only mediate apoptosis but also regulate other parameters of CCK-induced acinar cell injury that are characteristic of pancreatitis
