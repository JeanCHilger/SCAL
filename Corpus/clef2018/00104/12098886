Serum vitamin A concentration in dogs with experimentally induced exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Serum concentration of Vitamin A was determined in dogs with experimentally induced exocrine pancreatic insufficiency following oral administration of vitamin A, or pancreatic enzyme and vitamin A. In dogs receiving vitamin A alone, serum vitamin A concentration was significantly lower than that of dogs supplemented with pancreatic enzyme and vitamin A. In dogs with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, serum vitamin A concentration was lower than in healthy dogs. In healthy dogs, the normal range of serum vitamin A concentration is high in comparison with other species, and humans. It is concluded that in dogs with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, additional supplementation of vitamin A may be needed.
