Parotitis due to organophosphate intoxication. Acute pancreatitis due to pancreatic exocrine over-secretion induced by organophosphate poisoning has been previously reported but parotid gland involvement has not. This paper describes a case of acute organophosphate-induced parotitis in a patient with pre-existing sialolithiasis. The patient developed bilateral facial swelling in the pre-auricular area extending to the angle of the jaw and also developed elevated serum amylase on the second day of the poisoning. Serum lipase remained normal. Autopsy confirmed parotid gland inflammation and pre-existing ductal lithiasis. This case illustrates that organophosphate-induced parotitis can occur and should be considered in patients with organophosphate poisoning who have hyperamylasemia without elevation in serum lipase.
