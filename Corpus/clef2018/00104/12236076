Effect of intravenous and intraductal glucocorticosteroids in experimental acute pancreatitis in dogs. We evaluated the effect of systematically and intraductally administered glucocorticosteroid on experimentally induced acute pancreatitis in dogs. We examined histological and macroscopic changes as well as conventional laboratory parameters. We suggest, that low dose intraductal injection of glucocorticosteroid could have protective effect in acute phase of pancreatitis.
