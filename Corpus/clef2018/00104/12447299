EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration of the pancreas: evaluation of pancreatitis as a complication. EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration is rapidly becoming the procedure of choice for the diagnostic evaluation of pancreatic masses. Acute pancreatitis has been reported after EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration of the pancreas. This study evaluated the effect of EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration on the pancreas by serial measurement of amylase and lipase levels and determining the frequency of acute pancreatitis after EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration of pancreatic masses.In 100 consecutive patients referred for EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration of a pancreatic mass, amylase and lipase levels were determined immediately before and within 2 hours after the procedure. Additionally, patients were questioned as to the occurrence of symptoms of acute pancreatitis within 48 hours after EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration.For 2 of 100 patients (2%) there was clinical and biochemical evidence of acute pancreatitis after EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration. Both patients had a history of recent pancreatitis. In addition, there was a significant increase in postprocedure lipase levels (p = 0.40) compared with amylase levels in this patient subset.The frequency of acute pancreatitis after EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration of the pancreas was 2% in this study. A history of recent pancreatitis appears to be a potential risk factor. Amylase and lipase levels can be elevated after EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration and in most cases have no clinical significance.
