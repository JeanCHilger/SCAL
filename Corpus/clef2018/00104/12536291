Pancreatic encephalopathy: a 7-year follow-up case report and review of the literature. Pancreatic encephalopathy is a rare complication of acute pancreatitis. Clinical features include focal neurological signs and acute onset of dementia. This picture can fluctuate over time: cyclic progression with remission and relapses has been described. We present the case of a 43-year-old man who, after an acute episode of pancreatitis, experienced five relapses, with alternating focal signs. The patient has improved, but cognitive impairment persists after a 7-year follow-up.
