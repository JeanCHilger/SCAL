Acute experimental pancreatitis in the opossum. The role of early splenectomy in the inflammatory response]. The role of the Autonomous Nervous System in the immunologic and inflammatory response is still an issue of discussion. Furthermore, the physiopathologic mechanisms involved are still unknown. Acute pancreatitis (AP) does not escape this disconcert. In fact, like in every severe acute inflammatory process, its discontrol could be responsible of the high morbidity and mortality rates.To assess to which degree bilateral splanchnicectomy changes the course of acute inflammatory response in AP.Prospective research.The following parameters were evaluated: red blood cell count, white blood cell count, calcium, glucemia, urea, aminase, lypase and liver enzymes. Macroscopy and microscopy views of the pancreas were also obtained. The leucocitary response was abolished, and the calcium levels dropped to a lesser degree.Bilateral splanchnicectomy prior to unchaining AP had a beneficial effect, Its mechanism of action could have been through the disconnection of the respective reflex arches.
