Study on effect of emodin on TGF beta 1 expression in pancreatic tissue of rats suffering from acute pancreatitis. To investigate the effect and mechanism of emodin on pancreatic repairing and remodeling in treating acute pancreatitis by analyzing the change of cytokine transforming growth factor beta 1(TGF beta 1) gene expression, DNA synthesis and protein content in pancreatic tissue.Acute pancreatitis was induced in rats by intraperitoneal infusion of caerulein, treated or untreated by emodin. The animals were sacrificed at 6, 24, 48, 72 or 96 hrs after treatment separately. The mRNA expression of TGF beta 1, DNA synthesis and total protein content in pancreatic tissue were tested by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), 3H-thymidin method and Lowry's method respectively.Serum amylase level was decreased significantly after emodin treatment. TGF beta 1 mRNA expression was undetectable in the intact pancreas or in 6 hrs after pancreatitis induction in the non-treated group, but revealed at 24 hrs after and reached the peak at 72 hrs later. However, in the emodin treated group, TGF beta 1 mRNA expression was detected at 6 hrs after treatment, with a higher level in 24 hrs and 48 hrs as compared with the non-treated group, and reaching the peak at 48 hrs after treatment. Moreover, the DNA synthesis and total protein content in pancreatic tissue decreased significantly at 72 hrs and 48 hrs after induction respectively, but both parameters increased significantly in the emodin treated group 96 hrs after treatment.The mechanism of emodin in treating acute pancreatitis might be by way of enhancing cytokine TGF beta 1 gene expression, regulating cell growth and differentiation, stimulating the formation of extracellular matrix components, increasing DNA synthesis and protein content, and to take part in pancreatic repairing and remodeling.
