Combined use of ultrasonography and contrast enhanced computed tomography to evaluate acute necrotizing pancreatitis in two dogs. The imaging findings in two miniature schnauzers with acute necrotizing pancreatitis are described. Both dogs were treated previously for diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia. Vomiting, anorexia, and lethargy were observed in both dogs at presentation. Laboratory evaluations supportive of pancreatitis included left shift, abnormally high serum amylase and lipase activities, hypocalcemia, and abnormally high serum activities of liver enzymes. Sonographically, both dogs had diffusely enlarged hypoechoic pancreatic tissue with anechoic foci compatible with necrosis, abscessation, phlegmon, and pseudocysts formation. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) findings in both dogs were compatible with pancreatic necrosis. Dog 1 was managed medically for 11 days. Follow-up CT scan in this dog disclosed decreased pancreatic size and increased contrast enhancement compatible with partial resolution of pancreatitis.
