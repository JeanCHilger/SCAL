Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) presenting as pancreatitis. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare clinical entity. It is a multi-systemic disorder characterized by a clinical pentad of thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, diffuse and nonfocal neurologic symptoms, decreased renal function, and fever. Abdominal pain is an uncommon presenting symptom for TTP. Pancreatitis may occur from TTP or, in a few cases, may trigger TTP. The clinical diagnosis of TTP is generally difficult because there are many varied clinical presentations and the full expression of the pentad may be prolonged. However, once the diagnosis is suspected or confirmed, immediate plasmapherseis with plasma exchange must be performed to reduce the severe morbidity from neurologic disability.
