Lipid peroxidation inhibition reduces NF-kappaB activation and attenuates cerulein-induced pancreatitis. Increased lipid peroxidation, enhanced nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) activation and augmented tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) production have been implicated in cerulein-induced pancreatitis. We investigated whether lipid peroxidation inhibition might reduce NF-kappaB activation and the inflammatory response in cerulein-induced pancreatitis. Male Sprague-Dawley rats of 230-250g body weight received administration of cerulein (80 microg/kg s.c. for each of four injections at hourly intervals). A control group received four s.c. injections of 0.9% saline at hourly intervals. Animals were randomized to receive either raxofelast, an inhibitor of lipid peroxidation (20 mg/kg i.p. administered with the first cerulein injection) or its vehicle (1 ml/kg of a 10% DMSO/NaCl solution). All these rats were sacrificed 2 h after the last injection of either cerulein or its vehicle. Raxofelast administration (20 mg/kg i.p. with the first cerulein) significantly reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, an index of lipid peroxidation (CER + DMSO = 3.075 +/- 0.54 micromol/g CER + raxofelast = 0.693 +/- 0.18 micromol/g
