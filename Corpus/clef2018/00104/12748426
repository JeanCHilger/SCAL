Effects of octreotide pretreatment in experimental acute pancreatitis. Severity of systemic lesions and mortality of experimental acute pancreatitis (AP) are reduced after pancreatic enzyme content reduction induced by cerulein administration. Octreotide has been used both prophylatically and therapeutically in AP. The possible effects of octreotide on pancreatic enzyme content and its influence on pulmonary lesions of experimental AP were assessed in this study.Wistar male rats were divided in two branches: BRANCH I - Animals divided into three groups: Group Sa (n = 10) intravenous saline infusion Group Ce (n = 10) intravenous cerulein infusion, (0.133 micro g/kg(-1).h(-1)) and Group Oc (n = 10) SC octreotide (10 micro g/kg(-1)). Trypsin, elastase and amylase pancreatic contents as well as serum amylase were determined thereafter in all three groupsIncreased serum amylase and pancreatic enzyme contents were observed in octreotide-treated animals when compared to animals receiving saline or cerulein. After AP increases of serum and ascitic fluid amylase and of pancreatic TAP were observed in octreotide pre-treated animals when compared to saline and cerulein groups. Pulmonary interstitial and alveolar edema after AP was significantly increased in rats receiving octreotide as compared to the cerulein group.Octreotide administration acutely increases the enzymatic content of the pancreas and thus may have a potential deleterious influence in the evolution of AP.
