Acute pancreatitis in childhood. to evaluate etiological agents involved in acute pancreatitis in children, as well as clinical, laboratory and radiological findings and the illness clinical course.we reviewed the cases of acute pancreatitis diagnosed over the last 15 years. The criteria used for cases to be included were acute abdominal pain, elevated serum amylase levels and/or ultrasound abnormalities in the pancreatic area in conscious patients, and the last two criteria in unconscious patients.thirty-one children were included (average age 7.9 years, range 2-15 55% males). Infection and gallstones were the most common causes (19 and 16 %, respectively). In all, 9.7% of cases were drug-related (valproic acid, L-asparaginase, azathioprine combined with high doses of methylprednisolone)acute pancreatitis should always be considered in children with abdominal pain. There are a wide variety of etiological factors and in a high percentage of patients no underlying cause is found.
