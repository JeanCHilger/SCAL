Role of procalcitonin rapid test in the differential diagnosis of uninfected and infected forms of acute pancreatitis. We analysed the clinical value of the procalcitonin quick test (PCT-Q BRAHMS Diagnostica, GmbH, Berlin) in infected pancreatic necrosis verified by guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA). In a prospective, controlled study the results of 24 patients were evaluated during 2001. PCT-Q test was performed in patients with necrosis verified on CT scan and/or septic symptoms. If PCT-Q test was positive or septic complication (infected necrosis or abscess) developed CT or US guided fine-needle aspiration was performed with Gram staining and bacterial culture of the sample. Positive FNA result was indication for surgery with repeated staining and bacterial culture of the surgical specimen. Septic complications of pancreatic origin developed in 12 patients. Comparing the results fine-needle aspiration was more authentic with a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 100%, while the sensitivity of the PCT-Q test remained 75% and its specificity 83%. Comparing abscess and infected necrosis, significantly higher procalcitonin values were detected in patients with necrosis. These results show that PCT-Q test can be a possible non-invasive method besides fine-needle aspiration. Elevated levels of procalcitonin (higher than 2 ng/ml) clearly suggest infection of the necrosis, while lower values do not exclude the possibility of local septic progression.
