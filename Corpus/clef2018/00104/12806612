Diclofenac reduces the incidence of acute pancreatitis after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Acute pancreatitis following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography presents a unique opportunity for prophylaxis and early modification of the disease process because the initial triggering event is temporally well defined and takes place in the hospital. We report a prospective, single-center, randomized, double-blind controlled trial to determine if rectal diclofenac reduces the incidence of pancreatitis following cholangiopancreatography.Entry to the trial was restricted to patients who underwent endoscopic retrograde pancreatography or had manometrically verified sphincter of Oddi hypertension. Immediately after endoscopy, patients were given a suppository containing either 100 mg diclofenac or placebo. Estimation of serum amylase levels and clinical evaluation were performed in all patients.A total of 220 patients entered the trial, and 110 received rectal diclofenac. Twenty-four patients developed pancreatitis (11%), of whom 7 received rectal diclofenac and 17 received placebo (P < 0.05).This trial shows that rectal diclofenac given immediately after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography can reduce the incidence of acute pancreatitis.
