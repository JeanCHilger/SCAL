Effects of duct reconstruction and estrogen treatment on endocrine and exocrine functions of fibrotic pancreas caused by ligation of the pancreatic duct in dogs. After fibrotic pancreas was produced by ligation of the pancreatic ducts in mongrel dogs, effects of duct reconstruction and estrogen treatment on endocrine and exocrine function of the fibrotic pancreas were investigated. 1) K value in IV-GTT and sigma IRG in IV-ITT were significantly improved after duct reconstruction in group with estrogen treatment, especially K value was significantly improved as compared with that in group without estrogen treatment. 2) Total volume of pancreatic secretion, total amylase output and maximal bicarbonate concentration in P-S tests were improved significantly after duct reconstruction in the group with estrogen treatment, but not significantly improved in the group without estrogen treatment. 3) Histological changes of the islet and pancreatic fibrosis, caused by the pancreatic duct ligation, were also significantly improved after duct reconstruction in the group with estrogen treatment, as compared with those in the group without estrogen treatment.
