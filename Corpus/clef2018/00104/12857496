Role of phospholipase A2 in injury of lung complicated by acute pancreatitis and the therapeutic effect and mechanism of verapamil on it. To investigate the role of phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) in injury of lung complicated by acute pancreatitis (AP) and the therapeutic effect of verapamil, furthermore to explore its possible mechanism.Eighty-two Sprague-Dawley rats both male and female were divided into three groups. AP was induced by injecting 3% sodium deoxycholate (1 ml/kg) into the biliopancreatic duct except the rats of sham operation group. Ten minutes after operation, rats were injected intraperitoneally with saline or verapamil, respectively. At 4 hours and 8 hours after treatment, the volume of as cites and pulmonary coefficient were measured. The amylase activity and calcium concentration in plasma and PLA(2) in ascites and homogenate of lung were determined. The survival time and mortality of rats in different groups were recorded, and the pathomorphism of pancreas and lung was observed under microscope.Verapamil reduced the mortality (P<0.05), and prolonged the survival time of rats with AP significantly (P<0.05), attenuated ascites volume, amylase activity and hypocalcemia in plasma, PLA(2) activity in ascites and lung homogenate, and ameliorated the inflammatory injury of pancreas and lung.The results suggest that PLA(2) plays a role in the injury of lung complicated by AP and verapamil possesses a therapeutic effect on the AP induced by sodium deoxycholate in rats, in which the mechanism might be due to inhibit PLA(2) activity by blocking calcium channel to ameliorate the damage of pancreas and lung which is induced by the overload of Ca(2+).
