Alterations of systemic endotoxemia over the course of acute edematous pancreatitis. correlation to the advent of an infection? To define whether bacterial translocation occurs over the course of acute edematous pancreatitis and to correlate its presence to the advent of an infection since data in humans are lacking.Thirty-three patients hospitalized over the period January 2000-January 2001 were subjected to venipuncture at regular time intervals for the collection of blood samples for blood culture and for determination of endotoxins and of C-reactive protein. Endotoxins were measured by the Limulus assay and C-reactive protein by nephelometry.A wide range of concentrations of endotoxins was observed over the first 3 days of the disease. Mean (+/-SE) of endotoxins was 4.01 +/- 1.36 and 2.42 +/- 0.95 EU/ml 3 and 6 h, respectively, after admission of afebrile patients. Respective values 3 and 6 h after admission of febrile patients were 3.03 +/- 1.14 and 5.84 +/- 2.28 EU/ml (normal <0.1 EU/ml) these values gradually decreased after the second day. No correlation was found between endotoxins and C-reactive protein. Endotoxins were increased as a result of the occurrence of an infection on the third day.A significant level of endotoxemia is observed over the course of acute edematous pancreatitis, which might be correlated to the advent of the systemic inflammatory response.
