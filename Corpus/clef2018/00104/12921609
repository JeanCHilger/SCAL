Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration in treatment of severe acute pancreatitis. To observe the efficacy of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) in the treatment of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP).Fifty three patients with SAP were involved, CVVH was performed for at least 24 hours. During CVVH, the patients' conditions and pancreatic enzymes (amylase and lipase) were observed, serum concentration of endotoxin was measured as well.After CVVH, the symptoms of patients such as tachycardia, respiratory distress, and abdominal pain were remitted. The APACHE II score decreased significantly. Six hours after CVVH, serum concentration of endotoxin was decreased significantly. Fifteen patients died, the mortality rate was 28.3%.CVVH could decrease the mortality rate of SAP with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
