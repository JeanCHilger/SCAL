Acute pancreatitis. While interstitial acute pancreatitis usually takes a benign course, necrotizing acute pancreatitis takes a severe course, mainly because of severe local and systemic complications. After a quick diagnosis it is necessary to rapidly assess a degree of severity of the disease and thus the prognosis. The clinical picture and the result of imaging procedures do not always correspond. The management basically includes to treat pain as well as to administer fluid, electrolyte, protein and calories. In addition, systemic treatment of complications such as shock or respiratory and renal insufficiency--if occurring--is necessary. In case of pancreatic necrosis, prophylactic administration of pancreas-penetrable antibiotics is recommended to avoid infection. In the severely ill with infected pancreatic necrosis, surgery is the treatment of choice. In approximately 10% of all patients with alcohol-induced pancreatitis, there is a gradual transition to chronic pancreatitis.
