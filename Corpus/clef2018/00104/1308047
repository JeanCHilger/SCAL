The effect of a cholecystokinin receptor antagonist lorglumid on the proteinase-antiproteinase balance in taurocholate acute experimental pancreatitis (AEP) in rats. The effect of new CCK receptor antagonist, lorglumid on taurocholate AEP in rats was studied. Lorglumid was applied intraperitoneally at a dose of 5.6 mg/kg BW immediately after taurocholate injection into choledochopancreatic duct. Activity of amylase, antithrombin III (AT III), alpha 1 protease inhibitor (alpha 1 PI), alpha 2 antiplasmin (alpha 2 AP) and alpha 2 M) in plasma, trypsin and chymotrypsin in pancreata were measured after 1, 3, 6 h of AEP. In AEP treated by lorglumid serum amylase activity and pancreatic wet weight was significantly reduced. The use of lorglumid prevented the increase of alpha 1 PI and alpha 2 AP compared to not treated animals. AT III and alpha 2 M in plasma and trypsin and chymotrypsin activity in pancreata did not change significantly in all groups. The mortality of the lorglumid treated rats was significantly lower in comparison with control group. It is concluded that lorglumid in taurocholate AEP moderates the changed plasma proteinase-antiproteinase balance. Our results indicate a protective effect of lorglumid in this model of acute experimental pancreatitis.
