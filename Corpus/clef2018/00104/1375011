Effect of somatostatin analogue and cholecystokinin receptor antagonist on bile-induced acute canine pancreatitis. To determine whether a synthetic somatostatin analogue, octreotide, and a cholecystokinin receptor antagonist, L-364,718, may be beneficial in acute pancreatitis, 33 dogs were assigned to four groups. Each dog underwent laparotomy with injection of autologous bile into the dorsal pancreatic duct. Thirty minutes after the induction of pancreatitis, Group 1 received a subcutaneous injection of octreotide (200 micrograms/kg), Group 2 received an equal volume of the octreotide carrier, Group 3 received an hourly intravenous bolus of L-364,718 (60 micrograms/kg), and Group 4 received an equal volume of the L-364,718 carrier. Hemodynamic profiles, arterial blood gases, plasma glucose, and serum amylase were obtained before laparotomy, at bile injection, and at hourly intervals. The pancreas was removed after 8 hours for gross evaluation, measurement of water content, and histologic examination. A significant decrease in cardiac index and a significant increase in serum amylase and pancreatic edema occurred in all four groups 8 hours after the induction of pancreatitis (P less than 0.05), but there was no statistical difference between any group. Likewise, there was no difference in gross or histologic changes in the pancreas of any group. The somatostatin analogue, octreotide, and the cholecystokinin receptor antagonist, L-364,718, did not ameliorate the effects of severe, bile-induced pancreatitis in dogs.
