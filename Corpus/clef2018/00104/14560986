Pancreatic ascites in an infant: lack of symptoms and normal amylase. A 4-month-old boy presented with 9 days of abdominal distension. The abdomen was tense, distended, and nontender, with a fluid wave. Hypoalbuminemia, hyponatremia, high lipase, normal amylase, high ascitic fluid: lipase, amylase, and serum-ascites albumin gradient < 1.1 were present. Abdominal CT showed large ascites, edema, and pancreatic cyst. No improvement was noted with bowel rest, TPN, albumin, furosemide, octreotide, and paracentesis. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography showed disrupted pancreatic duct and a cyst. Pancreatic duct stenting was complicated by early outward migration of the stent and was thus ineffective. An exploratory laporatomy revealed a cyst. Cystogastrostomy resolved the pancreatitis and ascites. The patient was discharged off TPN and tolerating enteral nutrition. Pancreatic ascites is rare, producing few or no symptoms in infants. In conclusion, our patient may have had viral pancreatitis, complicated by a disrupted duct and/or ruptured pseudocyst with ascites formation. Medical management was ineffective. Surgery appears to have been curative.
