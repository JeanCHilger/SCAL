Protective effect of human pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor on cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in rats. We examined the protective effect of human pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (PSTI), a specific trypsin inhibitor secreted from pancreatic acinar cells into the pancreatic duct, on cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in conscious rats. The protective effect of human PSTI-RS, an analogue of PSTI with Arg-44 to Ser substitution which has a longer half-life in vitro, was also examined. Intraperitoneal administration of a pharmacological dose of cerulein to conscious rats induced acute pancreatitis, characterized by light microscopy as cellular disorganization of the acini and interstitial edema. Intravenous infusion of human PSTI (10, 50 or 250 micrograms/rat/h) into rats with cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis decreased their pancreatic wet weight and plasma amylase concentration. It also caused a dose-dependent decrease in vacuoles in acinar cells and interstitial edema. Human PSTI-RS, which has a longer half-life in vivo, was more effective than native PSTI at the same dose rate (10 micrograms/rat/h) in reducing pancreatitis. These results suggest that human PSTI may have a beneficial effect on acute pancreatitis.
