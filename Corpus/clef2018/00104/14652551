Secretin MRCP and endoscopic pancreatic manometry in the evaluation of sphincter of Oddi function: a comparative pilot study in patients with idiopathic recurrent pancreatitis. Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction plays an important etiologic role in idiopathic acute recurrent pancreatitis. Sphincter of Oddi manometry is the most accurate test of sphincter of Oddi function, but it is associated with an increased risk of post-procedure pancreatitis and is non-diagnostic in about a third of cases. Secretin MRCP has a diagnostic efficacy comparable to ERCP, but data on its sensitivity with regard to sphincter of Oddi function are lacking. The aim of this study was to compare secretin MRCP and pancreatic sphincter of Oddi manometry for evaluation of sphincter of Oddi function in patients with idiopathic acute recurrent pancreatitis.Eighteen consecutive patients with idiopathic acute recurrent pancreatitis underwent secretin MRCP and pancreatic sphincter of Oddi manometry/ERCP. Data from 15 patients were suitable for analysis. Fifteen subjects with asymptomatic, non-pancreatic hyperamylasemia matched for age and gender underwent secretin MRCP and served as a control group.Sphincter of Oddi manometry documented sphincter dysfunction in 6/15 patients (40%) and secretin MRCP, in 4/15 patients (26.7%). Sphincter of Oddi manometry confirmed the presence of elevated basal sphincter of Oddi pressure in two of the 4 patients with abnormal and other forms of sphincter of Oddi dyskinesia in the other two. None of the control subjects had an abnormal secretin MRCP. Secretin MRCP and sphincter of Oddi manometry were concordant in 13/15 patients (86.7%) positive and negative diagnoses for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction agreed in, respectively, 81.8% and 100% (kappa value 0.706).Secretin MRCP seems to be a useful noninvasive procedure for investigation of pancreatic sphincter of Oddi function, but evaluation in larger series is needed.
