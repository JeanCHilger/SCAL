The effects of gingko biloba extract (EGb 761) on experimental acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis is an important and fatal disease with high mortality and morbidity. Although the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis is poorly understood, there are many studies that suggest the role for oxygen free radicals (OFRs) in the development of pancreatitis and its complications and show beneficial effects of scavenger treatment. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether Egb761, the standardized extract of gingko biloba, restrains the generation of OFRs and ameliorates the histopathologic findings of acute pancreatitis.Sixty male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly assigned to one of the following experimental groups. In early and late pancreatitis and treatment groups, acute pancreatitis was induced by retrograde infusion of 3% sodium taurocholate. In treatment groups, 100 mg/kg Egb 761 was given intraperitoneally (IP) 24 h and immediately before induction of pancreatitis. Sham-operated rats received isotonic saline instead of sodium taurocholate. After observation times of 3.5 and 12 h, the pancreas was removed for light microscopy and determination of malondialdehyde (MDA) levels as a marker for OFRs-induced lipid peroxidation. Serum samples also were obtained for amylase and lipase levels.There was no significant difference in control and sham-operated groups in terms of histopathologic findings and serum enzyme levels. The tissue concentrations of MDA and serum enzyme levels were significantly elevated in early and late treatment groups as compared with the control group. The treatment with Egb 761 caused significant decrease in serum amylase and lipase levels and histopathologic scores as compared with early and late pancreatitis groups.Prophylactic application of Egb761 exerts highly beneficial influence on the course of acute pancreatitis, and this seems to be related to the oxygen radical scavenger effect of Egb761.
