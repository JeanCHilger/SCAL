Experimental podophyllotoxin (bajiaolian) poisoning: II. Effects on the liver, intestine, kidney, pancreas and testis. Young male rats were orally intubated with podophyllotoxin: Group I, control animals, orally fed with vehicle only Group II, fed with an initial dose of 5 mg.kg-1 b.w., followed by a daily dose of 1.67 mg.kg-1 b.w. for 7d. Group III, fed with an initial dose of 15 mg.kg-1 b.w., followed by a daily dose of 5 mg.kg-1 b.w. for 7d. All animals were sacrificed 72 h after the last dosing. Histopathological examination revealed dose-related fatty change of the liver, atrophy and degenerative changes of the intestinal epithelial linings and testicular seminiferous tubules. Depletion of the pancreatic acinar cell granules was also apparent in the Group III animals. No pathology, however, was observed in the kidneys. The present study demonstrated for the first time degenerative changes in the liver, intestine, testis, and pancreas of animals ingested podophyllotoxin. These pathological changes correlate well with the clinical signs/symptoms of abnormal liver function, abdominal pain and diarrhea, and reduced serum amylase in humans poisoned by podophyllum. Inhibition of protein synthesis and mitosis (disruption of microtubules) are believed to be the underlying mechanisms of these changes observed in the animals intoxicated by podophyllotoxin.
