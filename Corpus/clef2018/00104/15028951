Disruption of paracellular sealing is an early event in acute caerulein-pancreatitis. Caerulein-induced pancreatitis is a widely used experimental model for studies on acute pancreatitis, however, the molecular mechanisms underlying pancreatitis in response to caerulein hyperstimulation are incompletely understood. We therefore studied early effects of caerulein on tight junctional integrity. Mice were injected with the cholecystokinin analogue caerulein (50microg/kg BW/h) to induce pancreatitis. In pancreatic tissue occludin, claudin 1, zonula occludens protein 1 (ZO-1) were stained immunohistochemically and F-actin was visualized with phalloidin-TRITC. Stained sections and isolated acini were studied by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Under control conditions occludin, claudin1, ZO-1, and F-actin showed a linear staining pattern delineating the apical membranes of intralobular duct cells and of acinar cells. While in vitro caerulein hyperstimulation induced within 10 minutes disassembly of both occludin and ZO-1, in vivo caerulein hyperstimulation induced disassembly of occludin and claudin1 but not of ZO-1 from the tight junctions. Subsequent progressive disruption of ZO-1 was detected in a time dependent manner. Disruption of the transmembrane tight junction proteins occludin and claudin1 is an early event of caerulein hyperstimulation and may allow evasion of noxious luminal content into the interstitium, which may augment edema formation in acute pancreatitis.
