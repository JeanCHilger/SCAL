C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes in the assessment of the prognosis of acute pancreatitis. The value of serum C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes and erythrocyte sedimentation rate in predicting the outcome of acute pancreatitis was evaluated for 57 episodes in 54 patients. Serum C-reactive protein levels on day 2, 4 and 7 after admission were significantly higher in 19 episodes of severe attacks than in 38 episodes of mild attacks (13.71 +/- 9.68, 9.00 +/- 7.54, 6.02 +/- 3.83 vs 4.78 +/- 3.91, 3.30 +/- 3.61, 1.43 +/- 2.08 mg/dL P less than 0.0001, P less than 0.005, P less than 0.0001, respectively). The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of predicting a severe attack were 94, 76 and 82% using C-reactive protein greater than or equal to 8 mg/dL on day 2
