Diagnostic criteria for pancreatic sonography during the course of uncomplicated acute pancreatitis (author's transl). The course of uncomplicated pancreatitis was followed by sonography in 45 patients. The changes during the disease and their temporal relationship to the clinical stage are illustrated by an example. During the initial phase of the disease the sonographic findings may be so slight that they are easily missed, although clinical symptoms are present. It is only during the main phase of the disease that the typical sonographic findings of acute pancreatitis develop. At this time, maximal increase in amylase activity has usually passed. During recovery, with uninterrupted clinical and biochemical improvement, changes in the sonogram can still be seen for between three weeks and four months.
