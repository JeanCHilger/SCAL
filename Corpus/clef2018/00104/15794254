Effect of tobacco smoking on amylase activity in patients with pancreatitis. The pancreas is one of the first organs pathologically affected by the tobacco smoking. However, the mechanism of development of these changes is not eventually recognised. It has been demonstrated that nicotine influences exogenous function of pancreas. The aim of this study is to prove the influence of tobacco smoking on amylase activity in serum and urine of smoking and non-smoking patients with diagnosed acute (AP), chronic (CP) and chronic exaggerated pancreatitis (CEP). Serum and urine has been collected from 57 patients with AP, CP and CEP. The activity of enzyme has been determined using the colorimetric method with ethylidene-G7-PNP (4,6-ethylidene-p-nitrophenyl-alpha,D-malthoheptozyde). The nicotine metabolites has been assayed with the immunoenzymatic method (ELISA) using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against cotinine. The highest amylase activity in serum and urine has been observed in smoking patients with CEP. Much higher differences in amylase activity has been estimated in urine of patients with CP and AP (CP: in non-smoking patients more than three times lower activity than in smoking patients AP: in non-smoking patients more than two times lower activity than in smoking patients). It has been revealed that the differences in amylase activity in both serum and urine in smoking patients in comparison with non-smoking patients with pancreatitis may prove a significant influence of tobacco smoking on exocrine function of pancreas.
