Acute pancreatitis: five year experience at the Hospital General de Mexico. In Mexico acute pancreatitis is an important cause of morbility and mortality. We here describe the characteristics of patients managed with that diagnosis at the Hospital General de Mexico.Retrospective, descriptive and observational study. Patients with acute panrcreatitis were seen between January 1996 to December 2000.The acute pancreatitis prevalence found in the hospital setting was 5%. We identified 104 patients, 62% men, with mean age 37 yrs. In 74% ofcases seen, we made a correct early diagnosis upon admission. The biliary (49%) and the alcoholic (37%) were the most frequent causes. Abdominal pain was the most common symptom at onset (94%). High leukocyte count (78%), followed by serum lipase (74%) was the most sensitive laboratory test. Only 34% of patients studied had an adequate nutritional status. 54% of' patients presented severe pancreatitis. The mean number of hospital days was 17 and 44% required ICU management. Thirty five percent required surgery where necrosectomy was performed and a mortality of 67% was found. The total mortality rate was 21%.The correct clinical diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is frequent. It is a more common finding than severe pancreatitis, but it does not increase the morbility and mortality in our patient population.
