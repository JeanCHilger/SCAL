Natural disruption of group 2 phospholipase A2 gene protects against choline-deficient ethionine-supplemented diet-induced acute pancreatitis and lung injury. Group 2 phospholipase A2 (PLA2) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of multiple organ failure associated with acute pancreatitis. C57 BL/6J mice are natural group 2 PLA2 knockout mice lacking group 2 PLA2 mRNA. To clarify the role of group 2 PLA2 in the exacerbation of acute pancreatitis, we studied the biologic and histologic alterations in choline-deficient and ethionine-supplemented (CDE) diet-induced pancreatitis in group 2 PLA2-deficient C57 BL/6J mice and compared them with those in wild-type mice.Female C57 BL/6J mice weighing 20 to 22 g were fed a CDE diet for 3 days to induce pancreatitis. Female C3H/HEJ mice were used as controls. Mice were killed on days 1, 2, and 3 after the onset of the CDE diet. The severity of pancreatitis was evaluated by survival rate, plasma PLA2 activity, serum amylase level, histologic changes in the pancreas and lung, and myeloperoxidase activity in the lung.The survival rate of C57 BL/6J mice was 100% up to day 3 after the onset of the CDE diet, whereas that of the control mice was 42% on day 3. Plasma PLA2 activity in control mice increased on day 3 but did not increase in C57 BL/6J mice. Serum amylase activity on day 3 in C57 BL/6J mice was 15,480 +/- 3036 SU/dL, which was significantly lower than that in the control mice (43,760 +/- 8657 SU/dL, P < 0.01). Histologic changes in the pancreas of C57 BL/6J mice were markedly milder than in control mice. The degree of alveolar membrane thickening and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the lung of C57 BL/6J mice were overtly less than those of the controls. Myeloperoxidase activity in the lung of C57 BL/6J mice was lower, albeit insignificant, than in C3H/HEJ mice.Natural disruption of the group 2 PLA2 gene protects against CDE diet-induced acute pancreatitis and associated lung injury. These findings support the view that group 2 PLA2 is one of the factors in the exacerbation of severe acute pancreatitis.
