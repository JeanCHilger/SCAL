In vitro examination of the influence of lipase and amylase on dog's pancreas tissue incubated with endotoxins, phospholipase A2 or cytokines. Proinflammatory cytokines are elevated during acute pancreatitis. The endotoxins and Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) also have important role in acute pancreatitis. The aim of this study was to determine, what factors are responsible for the tissue damage in acute pancreatitis. The examinations were performed on fixed and frozen sections of healthy dog's pancreas tissue. Direct effects of endotoxins, PLA2, and proinflammatory cytokines together with pancreas enzymes were examined on pancreatic tissue. Pancreas enzymes themselves did not cause any change in the structure of pancreas. The common influence of endotoxins, PLA2 and pancreas enzymes was examined, and finally the effect of proinflammatory cytokines and enzymes was examined on pancreas tissue. Our results show, that besides enzymes many other factors are necessary to inflict tissue damage in acute pancreatitis, but for necrosis the presence of TNF alfa is a must.
