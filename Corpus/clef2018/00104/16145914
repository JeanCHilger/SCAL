Preventive effect of 5-fluorouracil on post-ERCP pancreatitis. To investigate the preventive effect of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) on post-ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) hyperamy-lasemia and pancreatitis.One hundred and sixty patients who underwent ERCP were divided at random into 2 groups: group A (n = 80) was given meglumine diatrizoate with 5-FU and group B (n = 80) was used contrast medium without 5-FU. Blood was drawn in each group the day before, 6 hours and 24 hours following ERCP for amylase.Post-ERCP hyperamylasemia occurred in 9 patients in group A (11. 25%) and 45 in B (56.25%). The difference of both groups was notable. Pancreatitis ensued in 2 instances in group A (2.50%) and 8 in group B (10.00%). Their difference was significant.5-FU added in meglumine diatrizoate is helpful to prevent post-ERCP hyperamylasemia and pancreatitis.
