Effects of R-102444 and its active metabolite R-96544, selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonists, on experimental acute and chronic pancreatitis: Additional evidence for possible involvement of 5-HT2A receptors in the development of experimental pancreatitis. The effects of R-102444 ((2R, 4R)-4-lauroyloxy-2-[2-[2-[2-(3-methoxy)phenyl]ethyl]phenoxy]ethyl-1-methylpyrrolidine hydrochloride) and its active metabolite R-96544 ((2R, 4R)-2-[2-[2-[2-(3-methoxy)phenyl]ethyl]phenoxy]ethyl-4-hydroxy-1-methylpyrrolidine hydrochloride), potent and selective 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A (5-HT2A) receptor antagonists, on development of pancreatitis were investigated in experimental models of acute and chronic pancreatitis. Rat acute pancreatitis was induced by caerulein (20 microg/kg) intraperitoneal injection and by pancreatic duct ligation. In both the models, serum amylase and lipase activities were markedly increased. R-102444 dose-dependently reduced these enzyme activities at a dose range of 10 to 100 mg/kg (p.o.) for the caerulein model and 0.3 to 10 mg/kg (p.o.) for the ligation model. In a mouse model of acute pancreatitis induced by a choline-deficient, ethionine (0.5%)-supplemented diet, subcutaneous administration of R-96544 (10-100 mg/kg, bid) reduced serum amylase activity. Histological analysis showed that R-96544 dose-dependently attenuated pancreatic necrosis, inflammation and vacuolization. The effect of R-102444 was further examined in male Wistar Bonn/Kobori rats (4-9 months of age) which spontaneously show pancreatic fibrosis and parenchymal destruction compatible with human chronic pancreatitis. In Wistar Bonn/Kobori rats (from 3 to 9 months of age) fed a diet containing 0.017% and 0.17% of R-102444, pancreatic weight, pancreatic protein and amylase content were higher compared to those in non-treated pancreatitis control rats. Histological analysis showed that R-102444 suppressed parenchymal destruction and replacement with adipose tissue, indicating inhibition of pancreatic atrophy. These results clearly indicate that R-102444 and R-96544 inhibit the progression of acute and chronic pancreatitis and support the contention of possible involvement of 5-HT2A receptors in the progression of experimental pancreatitis.
