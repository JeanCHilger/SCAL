Cell death in pancreatitis: caspases protect from necrotizing pancreatitis. Mechanisms of cell death in pancreatitis remain unknown. Parenchymal necrosis is a major complication of pancreatitis also, the severity of experimental pancreatitis correlates directly with necrosis and inversely with apoptosis. Thus, shifting death responses from necrosis to apoptosis may have a therapeutic value. To determine cell death pathways in pancreatitis and the possibility of necrosis/apoptosis switch, we utilized the differences between the rat model of cerulein pancreatitis, with relatively high apoptosis and low necrosis, and the mouse model, with little apoptosis and high necrosis. We found that caspases were greatly activated during cerulein pancreatitis in the rat but not mouse. Endogenous caspase inhibitor X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) underwent complete degradation in the rat but remained intact in the mouse model. Furthermore, XIAP inhibition with embelin triggered caspase activation in the mouse model, implicating XIAP in caspase blockade in pancreatitis. Caspase inhibitors decreased apoptosis and markedly stimulated necrosis in the rat model, worsening pancreatitis parameters. Conversely, caspase induction with embelin stimulated apoptosis and decreased necrosis in mouse model. Thus, caspases not only mediate apoptosis but also protect from necrosis in pancreatitis. One protective mechanism is through degradation of receptor-interacting protein (RIP), a key mediator of "programmed" necrosis. We found that RIP was cleaved (i.e. inactivated) in the rat but not the mouse model. Caspase inhibition restored RIP levels
