Local and systemic effects of hypertonic solution (NaCl 7.5%) in experimental acute pancreatitis. Severe acute pancreatitis (AP) is characterized by hemodynamic alterations and a systemic inflammatory response, leading to a high mortality rate. Treatment of hemorrhagic shock with hypertonic saline solutions significantly reduces mortality through an improvement in the hemodynamic conditions and possibly by an anti-inflammatory effect. Therefore, hypertonic solutions could be effective in AP.Wistar rats were divided in 4 groups: group C, control, without AP group NT, AP, without treatmentIn animals of groups NS and NT, a significant decrease of MAP was observed 48 hours after AP (NS: 91 +/- 3 mm Hg NT: 89 +/- 3 mm Hg) compared with baseline (C: 105 +/- 2 mm Hg) and to HTS group (HTS: 102 +/- 2 mm HgThe administration of hypertonic saline solution in experimental AP attenuated hemodynamic alterations, decreased inflammatory cytokines, diminished systemic lesions and pancreatic acinar necrosis, prevented pancreatic infection, and reduced the mortality rate.
