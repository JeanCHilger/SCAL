Influence of tobacco smoking on lipase activity in patients with pancreatitis. The aim of this study is to prove the influence of tobacco smoking on lipase activity in the blood of smoking and non-smoking health persons and in smoking and non-smoking patients with diagnosed acute (AP), chronic exaggerated (CEP) and chronic pancreatitis (CP). The blood has been collected from 28 healthy persons and 55 patients with AP, CEP and CP. The enzyme activity has been determined using the colorimetric method with substrate 1,2-odilauryl-rac-glycero-3-glutaric acid -(6-methylresorufin) ester. The exposures to tobacco smoke have been examined on the basic of concentration of cotinine in the serum of patients. The highest lipase activity has been found in smoking patients with CEP. It has been noted that the serum lipase activity is significantly higher in smoking and healthy persons (p<0,05) then in non-smoking and healthy patients. However no significant differences have been found between the lipase activity in smoking patients with CP and non-smoking patients with CP. Smoking patients with AP and CEP have been found to have a significantly increased enzyme activity (p>0.01 p>0.05 respectively) when compared to non-smoking patients. Results of examination indicate that tobacco smoking has a significant influence on exocrine function of pancreas.
