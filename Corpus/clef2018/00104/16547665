Safeguards against acute pancreatitis associated with endoscopic papillary balloon dilatation. Endoscopic papillary balloon dilatation (EPBD) is one of the methods used to remove bile duct stones. EPBD may preserve the function of the sphincter of Oddi in spite of the potential risk of acute pancreatitis caused by the procedure. There are only few reports of attempts to reduce the risk of acute pancreatitis in EPBD.We performed EPBD for bile duct stone removal in 201 patients. We used an 8-mm balloon followed by drip infusion of isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) at a rate of 5 mg/h for low-pressure EPBD. The function of the minor duodenal papilla, the inflation pressure required for the disappearance of the notch sign in the bile duct, and the serum amylase level after EPBD were observed.The median serum amylase level after the procedure was 367 IU/l. Acute pancreatitis occurred in two patients (1.0%). The two patients with acute pancreatitis had poor function of the minor duodenal papilla, a high inflation pressure (over 5 atm) required for disappearance of the notch, sign, and severe abdominal pain during balloon inflation as well, the procedure took a long time. The rate of duct clearance was 99.5%.EPBD with gradual inflation of the balloon at a low pressure, followed by ISDN drip infusion, could decrease the risk of acute pancreatitis associated with the procedure. Poor function of the minor duodenal papilla, high inflation pressure required for disappearance of the notch, sign, severe abdominal pain, and a lengthy procedure increase the risk of acute pancreatitis after EPBD.
