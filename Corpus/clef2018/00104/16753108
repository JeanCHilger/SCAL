Hereditary pancreatitis caused by a new mutation in the trypsinogen gene. Report of a family. Hereditary pancreatitis is an uncommon autosomal dominant disease secondary to a mutation normally located in the trypsinogen gene, preventing trypsin deactivation. This mutation translates clinically into recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis and an increased risk of pancreatic cancer. We report a case of acute hereditary pancreatitis due to a trypsinogen mutation that has previously been described in only one family.
