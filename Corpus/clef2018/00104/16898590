Lymphocyte metabolism in patients with acute pancreatitis with different genotypes of GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes. In this study, we have investigated correlation between enzymatic activity of NAD(P)-dependent dehydrogenases of lymphocytes and polymorphic variants of glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) and T1 (GSTT1) genes in the group of unrelated patients with acute pancreatitis in comparison with healthy Russians from Krasnoyarsk. Thus, genotype GSTM1 0/0 is the marker of predisposition to the acute pancreatitis, wheras polymorphism of the GSTT1 gene is not involved in the development of the pancreatitis, at least in our group. The bioluminescence analysis showed statistically significant decrease of the levels of G3PD, NAD(+)MDH and the increase of NADH(+)LDH, NAD(+)GDH, NADH(+)GDH in lymphocytes of pancreatic group. Development of pancreatitis in patients with different genotypes GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes showed the rearrangement of the basic intracellular processes: dominance of a plastic metabolism in the patients with GSTM1--deletions and predominance of energetic processes at GSTT1 0 - pancreatitis.
