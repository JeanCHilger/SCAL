A new model of chronic pancreatitis in rats. This study was designed to examine whether continuous pancreatic ductal hypertension (PDH) plays an important role in the onset and development of chronic pancreatitis (CP). Pancreatic, biliary, and duodenal cannulas were implanted in male Wistar rats. PDH was induced by vertically raising the free end of the pancreatic duct cannula to exert a hydrostatic pressure and maintained for 2 wk. PDH was gradually increased, but when the pancreatic juice (PJ) flow was interrupted, PDH was decreased to restore PJ flow. The induction of PDH resulted in a marked reduction of amylase activity in PJ and an increase in serum amylase activity. At 2 wk after persistent PDH, pancreatic exocrine function was markedly decreased in response to a bolus injection of secretin (100 pmol/kg) compared with the control group. Histological examination revealed interlobular as well as intralobular fibrosis in the form of nodular pancreatitis at 2 wk after the induction of PDH. Immunohistochemistry revealed the expression of fibronectin and collagen types I and III. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR showed an increase in transforming growth factor-beta(1) mRNA expression in the pancreas during PDH. The present results suggest that PDH plays an important role in the onset and development of CP. Furthermore, our animal model seems useful for investigating the mechanisms of CP in rats.
