Diabetic strain (WBN/Kob) of rat characterized by endocrine-exocrine pancreatic impairment due to distinct fibrosis. A spontaneously developed endocrine-exocrine pancreatic dysfunction was observed in the aged males of an inbred strain of Wistar rats, WBN/Kob. Nonobese male WBN/Kob rats developed glycosuria and hyperglycemia at around 9 months of age. Cumulative incidence of diabetes in male rats was 43% (33 of 76) at 12 months of age and reached 90% at the age of 21 months. In contrast, female rats did not become diabetic. Urinary excretion of amylase in WBN/Kob rats was significantly increased in comparison with control Wistar rats. Moreover, the exocrine pancreatic function test was impaired in WBN/Kob rats. Pathological examination of pancreata revealed infiltration of inflammatory cells, hemorrhage, deposition of hemosiderin, and fibrinous exudation around pancreatic ducts and blood vessels at 3 months of age. A gradual increase of fibrous tissue into the exocrine tissue and islets was observed with advancing age. The extremely enlarged interlobular lymph nodes were also observed. At the age of 12 months, the fibrous tissue replaced extensive areas of the pancreas and involved islets. The amylase content of pancreata in WBN/Kob rats was markedly decreased in comparison with that in Wistar rats at 12 months of age. Islets composed of few endocrine cells were detected. Immunohistochemical staining for insulin and glucagon showed a decreased number of not only B cells but also A cells. Moreover, both the pancreatic insulin and glucagon contents were markedly decreased in WBN/Kob rats in comparison with Wistar rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
