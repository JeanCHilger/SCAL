Caerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in the rat. Pancreatic secretory response to cholecystokinin. The response of pancreatic exocrine secretion to cholecystokinin (CCK), has been studied in experimental acute pancreatitis induced in rats by supramaximal doses of caerulein. Several doses of caerulein were used (4, 20 and 40 micrograms/Kg) and each one was administered by four subcutaneous injections over 3 h at hourly intervals. Pancreatic juice was collected 9 h after the first injection. The caerulein-treated animals showed a statistically significant increase in serum amylase levels. Secretory activity of ductular cells remained unchanged in all the caerulein-treated animals, but total protein and amylase secretion decreased significantly at all the caerulein doses used, both in resting conditions and under stimulation with CCK (1.25 micrograms/Kg/h). Despite this the acinar cells of rats treated with the lowest dose of caerulein retained a certain degree of secretory function since amylase activity in pancreatic juice was greater than in other groups of rats treated with higher doses of caerulein. Moreover, the percentage of increase observed in total protein and amylase in response to CCK respect to basal secretion is similar to that of the untreated animals. At higher doses (20 and 40 micrograms/Kg) the secretory capacity in response to CCK was inhibited. Therefore CCK administration in slight acute pancreatitis could be used as a therapy since it favours the secretion of pancreatic enzymes at percentual levels similar to those of the controls.
