Evaluation of sequential perfusion with Euro-Collins and Belzer solutions for pancreas preservation in rats. To investigate the effect of Euro-Collins and Belzer solutions in a sequential preservation of the pancreas.Forty-five Wistar-EPM rats were divided into four groups, according to the solution used during preservation: (1) saline solution (SF): animals perfused and preserved with saline solution (2) Euro-Collins group (C): animals perfused and preserved with Euro-Collins solutionGroups SF and C showed the highest amylase levels in the preservation solution during all periods. The levels were higher than in groups C and CB (P = .05). Amylase levels were similar in groups B and CB to 24 hours (P = .05). Histological analysis was significant for analysis of pancreas islet cells and edema. Groups B and CB were histologically similar (P = .001) and different from groups SF and C.Sequential perfusion using Euro-Collins and Belzer solutions was effective for pancreas preservation in rats up to 24 hours.
