Initial pathophysiological changes in chronic pancreatitis induced by pancreatic ductular obstruction model. An experimental chronic pancreatitis model was made in five dogs with chronic pancreatic fistula by injection of microspheres into the peripheral pancreatic duct. Sequential changes of pancreatic exocrine and endocrine functions with morphology were studied. Significant decreases in volume bicarbonate output and amylase output were detected in each sample collected separately on secretin and secretin cerulean stimulation. While the viscosity of pancreatic juice was significantly increased with a concomitant increase in hexosamine concentration, chronic pancreatitis was demonstrated morphologically. These results suggest that concentrated pancreatic juice caused by a decrease in volume and an increase in viscosity of pancreatic juice with a concomitant increase in hexosamine concentration brings about the progression of chronic pancreatitis in this experimental model.
