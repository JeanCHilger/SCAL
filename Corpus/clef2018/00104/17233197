Recurrent acute pancreatitis probably secondary to lisinopril. Few data exist about the incidence of drug-induced acute pancreatitis in the general population. Although angiotensin-converting enzymes are generally well tolerated, acute pancreatitis has been reported in a few subjects treated with captopril, enalapril, and lisinopril. However, to our knowledge, there is no published data regarding recurrent pancreatitis secondary to lisinopril. Herein, we report the case of a 54-year-old man who developed recurrent acute pancreatitis after starting lisinopril.A 54-year-old man with a longstanding history of hypertension, treated with lisinopril 10 mg once daily, presented with acute pancreatitis. Other causes of the disease were ruled out. After cessation of lisinopril, his condition improved and his amylase level decreased. This was his third episode of acute pancreatitis since lisinopril had been started in 2002. After discontinuing lisinopril and beginning treatment with amlodipine 10 mg/d, the patient was well at follow-up examination and has not had another episode of pancreatitis during the subsequent 7 months.This case report demonstrates additional evidence of acute pancreatitis associated with an ACE inhibitor.
