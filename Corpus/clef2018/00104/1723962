Determination of pancreatic blood flow at the early stage of acute haemorrhagic necrotizing pancreatitis induced by sodium taurocholate in rats. Acute haemorrhagic necrotizing pancreatitis was induced by injecting 5% sodium taurocholate (Na-Tc) directly into the common biliopancreatic duct in rats. In control group 0.9% NaCl was used. The activity of serum lipase and amylase distinctly increased at 3 h and went up to the maximum at 12 h after injection of Na-Tc. The pancreatic blood flow and tissue perfusion per gram increased apparently at 1 h and decreased at 12 h after injection of Na-Tc by using the fractional indicator distribution technique with 86RbCl. The results demonstrated that the early stage of acute haemorrhagic necrotizing pancreatitis induced by Na-Tc in rats was still a primary inflammatory response.
