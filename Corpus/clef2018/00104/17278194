Experimental study of therapeutic efficacy of Baicalin in rats with severe acute pancreatitis. To observe the therapeutic efficacy of Baicalin in rats with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) and explore its therapeutic mechanisms.The SAP rat models were randomly divided into the model control group, Baicalin treatment group, octreotide treatment group and sham operation group. All groups were randomly subdivided into 3 h, 6 h and 12 h groups with 15 rats in each group. The survival, ascites volume and pathological changes of pancreas in all rats were observed at different time points after operation. The plasma amylase content and serum TNF-alpha, IL-6, malonaldehyde (MDA) and PLA(2) contents were also determined.The survival was not obviously different between the treated groups, and was significantly higher in treated groups at 12 h compared to the model control group (P < 0.05, 15 vs 10). The ascites/body weight ratio at 3 h and 6 h was significantly lower in Baicalin treatment group compared to the model control group and octreotide treatment group (P < 0.05, 1.00 vs 2.02 and 1.43 and P < 0.001, 2.29 (1.21) vs 2.70 (0.80) and 2.08 (2.21), respectively). The contents of amylase, TNF-alpha, IL-6, MDA and PLA(2) were significantly lower in the treated groups than in the model control group (P < 0.05, 4342 vs 5303, 5058 vs 6272 in amylase, P < 0.01, 21.90 vs 36.30, 23.80 vs 39.70, 36 vs 54.35 in MDA and 56.25 vs 76.10 in PlA(2), or P < 0.001, 65.10 and 47.60 vs 92.15 in TNF-alpha, 3.03 vs 5.44, 2.88 vs 6.82, 2.83 vs 5.36 in IL-6, respectively). The pathological scores of pancreas in the treated groups were significantly lower than that in the model control group (P < 0.05, 9.00 vs 10.05, 6.00 vs 9.00, 8.00 vs 10.05), but no marked difference was found between the treated groups.The Baicalin injection has significant therapeutic effects on SAP rats, its effects are similar to those of octreotide. The Baicalin injection is also cheap and has a big application range, quite hopefully to be used in clinical treatment of SAP.
