Clinical early intervention of Tongxia Huayu Decoction on pancreatic microcirculatory disturbance in severe acute pancreatitis. To study the mechanisms of Tongxia Huayu Decoction (a Chinese herbal decoction for purgation and removing blood stasis) in prognostic improvement for severe acute pancreatitis by early intervention on pancreatic microcirculatory disturbance.Fifty-three patients with severe acute pancreatitis were divided randomly into treatment group (n=28) and control group (n=25). Tongxia Huayu Decoction was given to the patients in treatment group in addition to the normal treatment in control group for one week. The clinical symptoms and signs, hemodiastase, urinary amylase, C-reactive protein (CRP) and endothelin (ET) of the patients in the two groups before and after treatment were observed and detected.The total response rate of the treatment group was 98.4%, while that of the control group was 80%, with significant difference between them (P<0.05). There was no significant difference of the contents of hemodiastase, urinary amylase, CRP and ET between the two groups before treatment, while they were significantly decreased after treatment (P<0.01) with more obvious change in treatment group (P<0.01).Tongxia Huayu Decoction brings satisfied therapeutic effect on severe acute pancreatitis. The mechanisms may associate with its reducing function on ET releasing so as to inhibit the pancreatic microcirculatory disturbance and acinar cell injury induced by ET.
