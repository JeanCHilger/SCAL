Evaluation of serum amylase and gabexate mesilate with endoscopic papillary balloon dilatation. Gabexate mesilate (GM) relaxes the papilla of Vater in addition to inhibiting the several proteases. We evaluated whether prophylactic administration of GM would prevent the occurrence of acute pancreatitis in endoscopic papillary balloon dilation (EPBD). Nineteen patients with common bile duct stones were separated into two groups according to the admission year. The group A has been administered GM intravenously at 2mg/kg/hr after EPBD till six hours later, and the group B has been administered GM before fifteen minutes of EPBD till six hours later. The mean value of sphincter of Oddi (SO) basal and peak pressure in the group B was significantly lower than that in the group A, moreover the mean value of the pancreatic pressure in the group B was significantly lower than that in the group A. However two cases had mild acute pancreatitis in the group B. GM loosened SO and pancreatic duct pressure by direct stimulation of SO, although it could not have enough effect to prevent the acute pancreatitis in EPBD.
