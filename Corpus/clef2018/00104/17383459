Prophylactic administration of somatostatin or gabexate does not prevent pancreatitis after ERCP: an updated meta-analysis. The prophylactic use of somatostatin or gabexate in patients undergoing ERCP is still controversial.Our purpose was to update the meta-analysis on somatostatin (SS, 16 studies) or gabexate mesylate (GM, 9 studies) prophylaxis of post-ERCP pancreatitis and to run sensitivity analyses by subgrouping trials according to schedules of drug administration.Post-ERCP acute pancreatitis, hyperamylasemia, and pain.Heterogeneity was present among selected studies, which appeared eliminated when only 9 high-quality trials on SS and 5 randomized studies on GM were considered. After data were pooled from SS trials, pancreatitis occurred in 7.3% of controls versus 5.3% of treated patients, a nonsignificant effect (odds ratio [OR] = 0.73 95% CI 0.54-1.006). The funnel plot showed asymmetry with a negative slope (P = .05). The meta-analysis produced negative results for either short- (<6 hours) or long-term (> or =12 hours) SS infusion, whereas a bolus injection proved effective (OR = 0.271Short- or long-term infusion of SS or GM proved ineffective in reducing post-ERCP pancreatitis and pain. The beneficial effect of SS on postprocedural hyperamylasemia seems of marginal significance. When given as a bolus injection, SS maintains its promise in this field, but additional data are needed.
