Experimental acute pancreatitis in the rat. The quantification of pancreatic necrosis after the retrograde ductal injection of sodium taurocholate. Acute haemorrhagic pancreatitis was induced in rats by injecting 5% sodium taurocholate into the common biliopancreatic duct. The condition was associated with an increase in the serum amylase levels as well as progressive pancreatic necrosis resulting in 100% mortality before 36 hours. This experimental model was documented by quantifying nine different parameters of pancreatic necrosis and giving more information about the induced lesion. The extent of pancreatic necrosis was evaluated at different intervals, 5.77% at 12 hours, 14.9% at 24 hours, and the rats died before 36 hours of pancreatitis induction with an average percentual necrosis of 29.9%. This model seems suitable for more pathogenic as well as therapeutic studies on acute pancreatitis in the rat.
