Computed tomography severity index and C-reactive protein values predicting mortality in emergency and intensive care units for patients with severe acute pancreatitis. Severe acute pancreatitis is a multisystem disease in which various local and systemic complications lead to high mortality. We retrospectively examined the clinical and biochemical factors that may influence the risk of mortality on admission to emergency and intensive care units (ICUs).Sixty-eight patients were admitted into our hospital for acute pancreatitis and treated in our ICU for computed tomography-proven severe acute pancreatitis during the years 1997 to 2004. The clinical, biochemical, and radiologic data were reviewed from the computerized database, radiologic films, and patient records.The mortality rate during the ICU stay was 18% (12/68) and that during the whole period of hospitalization 26% (18/68). A C-reactive protein (CRP) value over 150 was the only independent predictor of mortality on admission into the emergency unit, whereas the computed tomography severity index and the elevated CRP value over 150 predicted significantly and independently mortality on admission into the ICU. Linear backward regression analysis showed that high CRP values and respiratory failure on ICU admission correlate with longer ICU stay. Men's ICU stays were longer than those of women.A high computed tomography severity index and CRP values over 150 on admission into the ICU are valuable predictors of the mortality risk. High CRP, renal and respiratory failure, and male gender are associated with longer ICU stay.
