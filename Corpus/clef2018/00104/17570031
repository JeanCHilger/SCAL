Effect of proton pump inhibitor on amylase release from isolated pancreatic acini. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) could inhibit the secretion of gastric acid. Meanwhile, it could also decrease the secretion of other digestive glands besides gastric parietal cell. As we know, PPIs have been widely used to treat acute pancreatitis, and it is effective in clinical practice. However, research showed the side effect of PPIs on acute pancreatitis. The direct effect of PPI on pancreatic secretion is still unknown. Our experiment investigated the direct effect of PPIs on pancreatic exocrine by isolated pancreatic acini. In our study, isolated pancreatic acini were prepared as previously described by Williams, and cerulein was added to stimulate its secretion. The amylase release in the suspension was determined after the administration of different concentrations of omeprazole and Sandostatin and its activity was also observed in different time phases. In our in vitro study, all results suggest that omeprazole has no direct repression on amylase release from isolated pancreatic acini.
