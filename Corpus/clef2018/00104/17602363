Pancreatic pseudocyst development due to organophosphate poisoning. Acute pancreatitis is a serious complication of organophosphate poisoning. There is no report in the literature dealing with the development of a pancreatic pseudocyst after complication of organophosphate-induced acute pancreatitis. Therefore, we present a case who developed pancreatic pseudocyst after complication of organophosphate-induced acute pancreatitis.A 17-year-old female patient with a history of ingestion of complication of organophosphate insecticide (DDVP EC 550, dichlorvos) was admitted with cholinergic symptoms. On admission, serum amylase and lipase levels were high and abdominal ultrasonography showed an edematous pancreas. No etiological factor for acute pancreatitis was evident.We diagnosed complication of organophosphate-induced acute pancreatitis. After four weeks, abdominal abdominal ultrasonography and computerized tomography revealed a pancreatic pseudocyst of 6 cm diameter. During follow-up, the pancreatic pseudocyst size regressed to 4 cm.Complication of organophosphate poisoning can cause acute pancreatitis and its complications. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment may reduce morbidity and mortality.
