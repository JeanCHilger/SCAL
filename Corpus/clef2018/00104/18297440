Blocking of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) activity attenuates the severity of acute pancreatitis in rats. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) has been shown to affect the progression of various inflammatory disorders, including pancreatitis. To investigate the role of MCP-1 in acute pancreatitis and to seek possible therapeutic means, we evaluated the effect of a plasmid expression vector containing a dominant-negative mutant MCP-1 gene (mMCP-1).Two rat models of acute pancreatitis were employed that used either cerulein (for mild pancreatitis) or a mixture of 5% taurocholic acid and trypsin (for severe pancreatitis). At 6 h after induction of acute pancreatitis with or without injection of mMCP-1, serum amylase levels and cytokine levels, as well as morphological evaluation of the pancreas, were determined. Survival rates were also evaluated.Severe pancreatitis was significantly reduced by mMCP-1 injection. mMCP-1 decreased serum levels of amylase, IL-6, IL-10, and LDH, and improved the survival rate 48 h after disease onset. Histopathological changes of pancreas and lungs were also improved by mMCP-1.MCP-1 appears to be involved in the progression of severe forms of acute pancreatitis. Our data suggested that MCP-1 is a candidate as a therapeutic target to treat acute pancreatitis.
