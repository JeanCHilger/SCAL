Interleukin-18, together with interleukin-12, induces severe acute pancreatitis in obese but not in nonobese leptin-deficient mice. Obesity is associated with increased severity of acute pancreatitis (AP). The cytokines IL-18 and IL-12 are elevated in patients with AP, and IL-18 levels are high in obesity. We aimed to develop a pathologically relevant model to study obesity-associated severe AP. Lean WT and obese leptin-deficient ob/ob mice received two injections of IL-12 plus IL-18. Survival, pancreatic inflammation, and biochemical markers of AP were measured. Dosing with IL-12 plus IL-18 induced 100% lethality in ob/ob mice no lethality was observed in WT mice. Disruption of pancreatic exocrine tissue and acinar cell death as well as serum amylase and lipase levels were significantly higher in ob/ob than in WT mice. Edematous AP developed in WT mice, whereas obese ob/ob mice developed necrotizing AP. Adipose tissue necrosis and saponification were present in cytokine-injected ob/ob but not in WT mice. Severe hypocalcemia and elevated acute-phase response developed in ob/ob mice. The cytokine combination induced high levels of regenerating protein 1 and pancreatitis-associated protein expression in the pancreas of WT but not of ob/ob mice. To differentiate the contribution of obesity to that of leptin deficiency, mice received short- and long-term leptin replacement therapy. Short-term leptin reconstitution in the absence of major weight loss did not protect ob/ob mice, whereas leptin deficiency in the absence of obesity resulted in a significant reduction in the severity of the pancreatitis. In conclusion, we developed a pathologically relevant model of AP in which obesity per se is associated with increased severity.
