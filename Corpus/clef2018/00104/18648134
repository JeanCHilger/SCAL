Statin pretreatment in experimental acute pancreatitis. Some authors have found beneficial effect of statins in certain inflammatory conditions, but the effect of statins on acute pancreatitis is not yet defined.The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of simvastatin on an experimental model of mild and severe acute pancreatitis.One hundred and one Wistar rats with cerulein or taurocholate-induced acute pancreatitis were used in this study.The rats were divided into two groups: Group I (n=51) received two previously i.p. injections (18+/-2 and 3+/-1 hours) of simvastatin (200 microg/kg) and Group II (n=50) received two previously i.p. injections of saline. Both groups were subdivided into two subgroups: mild pancreatitis (cerulein-induced IA, n=10The parameters evaluated were: pancreatic vascular permeability, tissue water content, histologic lesion, amylase serum levels in rats with mild pancreatitis (subgroups A) mortality rate, serum levels of IL-6, IL-10, amylase, pulmonary myeloperoxidase activity and ascitic levels of TNF-alpha in rats with severe pancreatitis (subgroups B).Serum levels of IL-10 were significantly lower in the simvastatin-treated group as well as the myeloperoxidase activity. There was no significant difference in any of other studied parameters.Simvastatin appears to reduce inflammatory cytokines and pulmonary neutrophilic activation in the severe acute pancreatitis model, but there is no significant effect on survival curve, in spite of a clear trend towards a better survival in the simvastatin group.
