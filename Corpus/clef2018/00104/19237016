Rosiglitazone attenuates the severity of sodium taurocholate-induced acute pancreatitis and pancreatitis-associated lung injury. In addition to the effect of regulating adipocyte differentiation and insulin sensitivity, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) ligands also exhibit anti-inflammatory effect. However, the mechanisms concerning how PPAR-gamma ligands affect acute pancreatitis and pancreatitis-associated lung injury have not been fully elucidated. This study investigated the effect of rosiglitazone, a PPAR-gamma ligand, on acute pancreatitis and pancreatitis-associated lung injury in the rat pancreatitis model induced by sodium taurocholate.Acute pancreatitis was induced by retrograde infusion of 5% sodium taurocholate (1 mL/kg) into the bile-pancreatic duct. Rosiglitazone (6 mg/kg) was administered via the femoral vein 30 min prior to the infusion of sodium taurocholate. The severity of pancreatitis was evaluated by serum amylase level, myeloperoxidase activity, and pathology. Pancreatitis-associated lung injury was evaluated by myeloperoxidase activity, the magnitude of pulmonary edema and pathology. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha mRNA expression were studied using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. ICAM-1 protein expression was studied using Western blot analysis.Prophylactic administration of rosiglitazone attenuated (1) serum amylase level (2) myeloperoxidase activity of pancreatic and pulmonary tissueOur study demonstrated that rosiglitazone exerts a protective effect against sodium taurocholate-induced pancreatic and pulmonary injury.
