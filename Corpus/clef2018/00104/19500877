Acute pancreatitis and space-occupying hepatic lesions in a patient with bone marrow transplant due to multiple myeloma. Patients with multiple myeloma (MM) do not have a higher incidence of acute pancreatitis or pancreatitis of other etiologies than the general population. However, these patients may develop acute pancreatitis, or hyperamylasemia or isolated hyperlipasemia, due to etiologies that are highly infrequent in the absence of hematological disease. Liver involvement is found in 30-50% of patients with MM and mainly manifests as diffuse sinusoidal infiltration and less frequently in the form of nodules. We report the case of a patient who underwent bone marrow transplantation due to MM who showed clinical and laboratory findings compatible with acute pancreatitis of unknown origin, during which the presence of multiple space-occupying hepatic lesions was identified. Based on the results of biopsy, a diagnosis of extramedullary recurrence of MM was established.
