Duodenal stenosis caused by cystic dystrophy in heterotopic pancreas: report of a case. We herein describe the first reported case of duodenal stenosis caused by cystic dystrophy in heterotopic pancreas (CDHP) in Asia. A 63-year-old man was admitted to the hospital presenting with nausea and vomiting of 2 days' duration. Laboratory examinations showed an elevation in both the serum amylase level (275 IU/l) and white blood cell count (13 600/microl). A 3-cm-diameter tumor close against the duodenum was pointed out from the results of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) the tumor contained a cystic and solid component. Endoscopic examinations and an upper gastrointestinal series showed stenosis of the second portion of the duodenum without any mucosal change. The tumor was considered to be located at the submucosal layer of the second duodenum. The biopsy specimen of the duodenum revealed no malignancy. We strongly doubted the presence of a malignant submucosal tumor in the duodenum based on the findings of diagnostic imaging, and a pancreaticoduodenectomy was thus performed. Histopathologically, the lesion was diagnosed to be CDHP. The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient was symptomatic but was free of any symptoms after surgery. He continues to be regularly followed up on an outpatient basis and has had no recurrence of symptoms. This case demonstrates the need to consider CDHP in the differential diagnosis as a rare cause of duodenal stenosis.
