Total parenteral nutrition attenuates cerulein-induced pancreatitis in rats. Our aim was to determine if total parenteral nutrition (TPN)-induced pancreatic atrophy and Hsp70 expression attenuates cerulein-induced pancreatitis in rats.Rats were randomized to a 7-day course of saline infusion plus a semipurified diet or TPN, with or without an intravenous cerulein injection or vehicle on day 7, and killed 1 or 6 hours after the injection. Based on a pilot study, 1 hour was the primary time point. Pancreatic atrophy was determined by mass, protein, and DNA contents. Pancreatic heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) expression was measured by Western analysis. Histological examination of the pancreas assessed for edema, inflammation, vacuolization, and apoptosis. Serum amylase activity was measured using the Phadebas assay. Pancreatic trypsinogen activation was measured using a fluorometric substrate assay.The saline-infused rats fed orally gained significantly more weight than TPN rats. The TPN decreased the pancreatic mass and protein content and the protein-DNA ratio and increased the pancreatic DNA content compared with the saline. The TPN increased the pancreatic Hsp70 expression by 91% compared with the saline. The TPN reduced the cerulein-induced pancreatic histological edema, the vacuolization, and the inflammation compared with the saline. The increase in the serum amylase level after cerulein injection was significantly attenuated, and trypsinogen activation was reduced in TPN animals compared with the saline group.Lack of luminal nutrients with a 7-day course of TPN provides moderate protection against cerulein-induced pancreatitis in rats.
