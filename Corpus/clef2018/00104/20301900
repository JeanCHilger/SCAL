Electrophoretic pattern of alpha-amylase isoenzymes in serum of non-smoking and smoking normal persons and patients with pancreatitis. Recent epidemiological studies have shown the significant role of tobacco smoking in the development of chronic pancreatitis. It has been demonstrated that nicotine may also alter normal exocrine pancreatic function. However, the mechanism of development of these changes has not been fully recognised. In this pilot study we used a electrophoresis to compare the serum amylase patterns of healthy smokers and non-smokers. Amylase isoenzymes, separated into the pancreatic types by electrophoresis in agarose gel. Sample volume was 20 mL. The electrophoresis was at 4 degrees C temperature for 2 to 2.5 h. Amylase isoenzymes on agarose gels was localized by staining using the visualization system Phadebas Amylase Test. In serum normal non-smokers, I and II-type isoenzymes were predominant. III type izoenzyme was found in serum of smoking patients with pancreatitis. Total amylase activity in serum of smokers was slightly above normal. The isoenzymogram shows the presence of II and III-type isoenzyme, increase of isoenzymes activity. Earlier study III-type isoenzyme was found only in serum from cases of acute pancreatitis. In electrophoretic pattern of alpha-amylase isoenzymes in serum of smoking normal persons and patients with pancreatitis was affirmed the additional form of izoenzmes of amylase, that provide damaging influence tobacco smoking on pancreas.
