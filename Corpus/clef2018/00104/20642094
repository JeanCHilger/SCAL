Pancreatic pseudocyst in Federal Medical Centre, Gombe and review of literature. Pseudocyst arises from pancreatic inflammation or ductal disruption and is the commonest cystic lesion of the pancreas. Although spontaneous resolution is common particularly in its early phase, progression of the cyst may culminate in grave consequences for the patient. The aim of the study is to highlight the presentation, management and outcome of pseudocyst in an environment where it is reportedly uncommon.Case series with review of literature.Although pancreatic pseudocyst is not very frequently seen in this environment, it is not entirely rare but is frequently misdiagnosed. Non specific symptoms in the early stage and subsequent confusion with various intra abdominal pathologies are among the reasons for late diagnosis and delayed intervention.Pseudocyst is amenable to surgical treatment. Early recognition is imperative in preventing complications and in defining the true incidence of this disease entity in our locality. Clinical suspicion in every setting of pancreatitis complemented by serum amylase estimations and early ultrasound scan will improve the diagnosis.
