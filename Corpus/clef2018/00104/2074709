Prognostication of severity of the course in acute pancreatitis. The authors picked out 200 case records of the patients with acute pancreatitis using a method of random sample. By means of the method of step-by-step discriminant analysis, the severity of the course of the disease was prognosticated. The age of a patient, duration of the disease, body temperature, leukocytic count and glucose level in the blood, amylase activity in the urine, presence of another pathology were analysed. The solving rule permitting to prognosticate an outcome of the disease with a high degree of probability was obtained. A variable directly dependent on the severity of a course of the disease--"degree of the severity of acute pancreatitis" was established.
