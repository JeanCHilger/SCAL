Extreme levels of hyperlipidaemia as a cause of acute pancreatitis. Hypertriglyceridaemia is an uncommon cause of acute pancreatitis, accounting for 1-4% of cases. In the case of lipoprotein-lipase mutations, lipid levels may rise to extreme levels during acute pancreatitis. In this case a 29-year-old female was hospitalized several times due to acute pancreatitis. She presented with extreme lipid levels and difficulty in blood testing. While the correlation of acute pancreatitis and hyperlipidaemia is known, awareness of its association with defects in lipid metabolism could, in this case, have furthered diagnostic and prevented repeated hospitalizations.
