Advances in prognostic factors in acute pancreatitis: a mini-review. Early assessment of the severity of acute pancreatitis is essential to the proper management of the disease. It is dependent on the criteria of the Atlanta classification system.PubMed search of recent relevant articles was performed to identify information about the severity and prognosis of acute pancreatitis.The scoring systems included the Ranson's or Glasgow's criteria ≥3, the APACHE II classification system ≥8, and the Balthazar's criteria ≥4 according to the computed tomography enhanced scanning findings. The single factors on admission included age >65 years, obesity, hemoconcentration (>44%), abnormal chest X-ray, creatinine >2 mg/dl, C-reactive protein >150 mg/dl, procalcitonin >1.8 ng/ml, albumin <2.5 mg/dl, calcium <8.5 mg/dl, early hyperglycemia, increased intra-abdominal pressure, macrophage migration inhibitory factor, or a combination of IL-10 >50 pg/ml with calcium <6.6 mg/dl.The prediction of the severity of acute pancreatitis is largely based on well defined multiple factor scoring systems as well as several single risk factors.
