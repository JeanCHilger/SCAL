Effects of gadolinium chloride on sodium taurocholate-induced pancreatitis in rats. To evaluate the effects of the use of gadolinium chloride before and after induction of acute pancreatitis with sodium taurocholate 3% in rats.Wistar rats were divided into five groups: SF--control with saline intra-ductal and IV GD control with saline intra-ductal and gadolinium chloride IVThe number of dead animals before the end of the experiment was significantly higher in TSGD (P = 0.046). The scores of pancreatitis and lung damage were higher in the groups that used sodium taurocholate compared to groups with intra-ductal infusion of saline solution. There were no differences in other variables studied when comparing TS, GDTS and TSGD groups.The benefits with the use of gadolinium chloride as a prophylactic and therapeutic drug were not demonstrated.
