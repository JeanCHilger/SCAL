Efficacy observation of electroacupuncture intervention on severe acute pancreatitis at early stage complicated with intestinal paralysis. To explore the clinical efficacy of electroacupuncture intervention on severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) at early stage complicated with intestinal paralysis.Sixty-eight cases of SAP were randomly divided into observation group (48 cases) and control group (20 cases). In observation group, according to the course of sickness, the early-stage subgroup (30 cases, hospitalized in 3 d) and late-stage subgroup (18 cases, hospitalized in 3-7 d) were subdivided. In control group, the conventional treatment was applied. In observation group, based on the same treatment as control group, electroacupuncture was supplemented at Zhongwan (CV 12), Zusanli (ST 36), Neiguan (PC 6), Hegu (LI 4), etc. Acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II scores, the recovery time of intestinal paralysis and laboratory indices, complications, operation transfer rate, death rate and the admission time were compared among groups after treatment.The total effective rate was 83.3% (25/30) in early-stage subgroup, which was superior to 72.2% (13/18) in late-stage subgroup and 65.0% (13/20) in control group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). In early-stage subgroup, the remission time of abdominal pain, the remission time of abdominal distention, the recovery time of borborygums, the recovery time of gas discharge, and the recovery time of defecation were all shorter significantly than those in late-stage subgroup and control group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). In early-stage subgroup, APACHE II scores, the recovery time of WBC and blood/uric amylase, complications, operation transfer rate, death rate and admission time were all lower remarkably than those in late-stage subgroup and control group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01) but, there were no statistical significant differences in comparison between late-stage subgroup and control group (all P > 0.05).The clinical efficacy of electroacupuncture intervention on SAP complicated with intestinal paralysis is superior remarkably to that of conventional treatment, and the efficacy of electroacupuncture intervention at early stage is better than that at late stage.
