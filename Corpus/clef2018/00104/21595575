Effect of Da-Cheng-Qi decoction on pancreatitis-associated lung injury in patients and anti-inflammatory responses in rat models. The traditional herbal medicinal formula Da-Cheng-Qi decoction (DCQD) has long been used to treat pancreatitis in China however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.To investigate whether DCQD is beneficial to the patients with lung injury in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) if it is, then to explore the lung protective effect of DCQD and the mechanism involved in rats.DCQD was enema administered to 70 patients for 7 days. Mortality, (multi)organ failure during admission were observed, blood samples for laboratory analysis were drawn on admission, on Days 3, 7, and 14 of the treatment. We also experimentally examined the function of two doses of DCQD in SAP rat models. IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10 mRNA expression in rat lungs was measured quantitatively by the RT-PCR method and confirmed by morphometric studies of the lungs.It was demonstrated that the administration of DCQD did shorten the average time that patients suffered acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Compared with untreated rats, the lungs of rats treated with DCQD showed significantly lower levels of proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β and IL-6 mRNA. Rats treated with DCQD had lower mean pathological lung lesion scores than those in SAP rats.DCQD has good prospects in the treatment for SAP because it did shorten the average time that patients suffered ARDS in the clinic. It exerts therapeutic effects on this disease through inhibiting the production of inflammatory mediators, decreasing the anti-inflammatory factors, and mitigating the pathological damage of the lung injury in SAP model.
