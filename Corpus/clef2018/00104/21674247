Diagnosis and treatment of acute pancreatitis. Current recommendations. Acute pancreatitis is a potentially life-threatening illness, with a short time frame for diagnosis and treatment. A number of recent experimental and clinical multicentre trials as well as meta-analyses have provided more far-reaching recommendations compared to previous guidelines. To answer 12 key questions, we performed a review of recent literature and current guidelines. Diagnosis can be made on the basis of history, physical examination and serum lipase alone. Cholestatic parameters and upper abdominal ultrasound enable verification of biliary etiology. Poor prognostic indicators include elevated blood sugar, BUN and hematocrit. The latter suggests early, adequate volume replacement, which should be tailored to the clinical picture, echocardiography and/or modern hemodynamic parameters. In addition to opiate analgesia, meta-analyses support the use of endoscopic retrograde cholangiography in pancreatitis of biliary origin, antibiotics in necrotizing pancreatitis and early enteral feeding. Even where necrosis is present, conservative management (radiologically or endoscopically placed drains) is appropriate.
