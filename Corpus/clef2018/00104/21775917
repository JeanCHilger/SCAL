Hydroxyethyl starch resuscitation reduces the risk of intra-abdominal hypertension in severe acute pancreatitis. This study aimed to address whether hydroxyethyl starch (HES) is beneficial for intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) in early stages.Forty-one patients with SAP were randomized to HES group (n = 20) and the Ringer's lactate (RL) group (n = 21). The groups received 6% HES 130/0.4 for 8 days and RL solution without colloid, respectively. The primary end point was the IAP. The secondary end points were fluid balance, major organ complications, the Acute Physiology and Chronic Heath Evaluation II score, and the serum levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and interleukin-8.The characteristics of baseline data were similar in the 2 groups. In the HES group, the IAP was significantly lower in 2 to 7 days, and fewer patients received mechanical ventilation (15.0% vs 47.6%). A negative fluid balance was observed earlier in the HES group than in the RL group (2.5 ± 2.2 vs 4.0 ± 2.5 days).Fluid resuscitation with HES in the early stages of SAP can decrease the risk of intra-abdominal hypertension and reduce the use of mechanical ventilation.
