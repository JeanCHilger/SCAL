Assessment of trypsinogen-2 levels as an early diagnostic for post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis. The objective of the present study was to assess the use of serum trypsinogen-2 (TRY-2) measurements in early diagnosis of pancreatitis after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).In this prospective study, investigation 1 involved collection of blood serum both before and at 2, 4, and 18 hours after ERCP, whereas investigation 2 involved collection before and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 18 hours after ERCP. Total amylase, pancreatic amylase, and TRY-2 levels were measured from serum samples, and values from patients with pancreatitis after ERCP were compared to those from healthy control patients after ERCP.In investigation 1, 8 of the 68 cases examined were diagnosed as post-ERCP pancreatitis. In the healthy group, total- and pancreatic-amylase levels peaked 4 hours after ERCP, and TRY-2 levels peaked at 2 hours after ERCP. In contrast, cases of post-ERCP pancreatitis demonstrated prolonged periods of high total-amylase, pancreatic-amylase, and TRY-2 levels. In investigation 2, none of the 23 cases was diagnosed as post-ERCP pancreatitis: Pancreatic amylase levels peaked 4 to 6 hours after ERCP and TRY-2 levels peaked 1 hour after ERCP.These results suggest that TRY-2 is a more sensitive marker than amylase, and it can be useful in early diagnosis of post-ERCP pancreatitis.
