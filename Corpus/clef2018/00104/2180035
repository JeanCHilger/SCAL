Semiquantitative lipase determination--a useful screening test for pancreatitis?. In 233 sera, taken from 112 patients and 20 healthy blood-donors, we have compared RapiTex-Lipase, a semi quantitative immunochemical latex test for the determination of the lipase, with the conventional quantitative method of determination in order to establish its diagnostical value as a screening test for acute pancreatitis. It appeared that, with a positive result of the test increased values of lipase were found in 98% of the cases, but that a negative result of the test did not exclude an increased lipase. The sensitivity of the test as to the quantitative determination of the lipase depended directly on the activity of the lipase and turned out to be acceptable at 88% only with values 4 X higher than the upper limit of the normal range. With values 5 X higher and more, it reached 100%. Even if the test, due to its very high level of discrimination, did not show a reaction in every case of unspecific extrapancreatic hyperlipasemia, its organ-specificity for the pancreas was reduced and came to 80 to 96% in patients with renal insufficiency, diseases of the liver, abuse of alcohol and in various non-pancreatic intra- or extra-abdominal affections. In 16/18 patients with acute pancreatitis the test used for screening turned out positive (sensitivity 89%), two patients with values between 2 and 4 X the upper limit of the norm had a negative test.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
