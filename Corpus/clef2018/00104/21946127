Celiac disease and autoimmune pancreatitis:  an uncommon association. A case report. We present the clinical scenario of acute abdominal pain in a 27-year-old man with recent-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus. Evaluation of the patient revealed elevated levels of serum amylase, lipase, and transaminase without any biliary obstruction. He had elevated serum IgG4 levels, and his computed tomography scan showed features consistent with autoimmune pancreatitis. Further evaluation revealed celiac disease. He was treated as a patient with autoimmune pancreatitis and was started on steroids in addition to a gluten-free diet. His liver function improved in 6 weeks. He gained weight and his glycemic control also improved. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography after 3 months revealed complete resolution of pancreatic enlargement. The patient is being followed up in our clinic since the past 3 years. To the best of our knowledge and according to the Medline search, this is the first case report of celiac disease as an association of autoimmune pancreatitis.
