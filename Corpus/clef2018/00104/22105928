Research on scutellarin parenteral solution's protective effects in rats with severe acute pancreatitis and multiple organ injuries. The aim of this study was to observe scutellarin parenteral solution's therapeutic effects and mechanisms in rats with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). We divided SD rats into four groups randomly: (1) sham-operated group, (2) model control group, (3) scutellarin-treated group, and (4) Salvia miltiorrhiza-treated group. All of those rats in the abovementioned groups are randomly subdivided into 6 and 12 h subgroups, respectively, according to the postoperative time. Rats have been mercifully killed at different time after operation, and then detected their serum amylase, contents of ALT, AST, BUN, and Cr and observed the pathologic changes of multiple organs (pancreas, liver, kidneys, and lungs). We found that the survival rates have no marked differences (P < 0.05) between model control group and two treated groups at any time points. AST and BUN serum contents have no marked difference (P > 0.05). ALT serum contents in S. miltiorrhiza-treated group (6 and 12 h) and scutellarin-treated group (12 h) are obviously less than those in model control group (P < 0.05). The serum contents of Cr and amylase in scutellarin-treated group (6 h) are obviously less than those in model control group (P < 0.05). There is a different degree of relief on the pathologic changes of multiple organs in the two treated groups compared with those in model control group, of which pancreas and liver's pathologic severity scores in scutellarin-treated group (6 and 12 h) have reduced (P < 0.01) significantly compared with those in the model control group. However, there are no significant differences between scutellarin-treated group and S. miltiorrhiza-treated group (P > 0.05). We think the scutellarin parenteral solution has a certain protective effect on SAP rats' multiple organ injuries.
