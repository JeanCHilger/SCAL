Effects of erythropoietin pretreatment on pro-and anti-inflammatory balance in rats with severe acute pancreatitis. To evaluate the effect of pretreatment with erythropoietin (EPO) on disordered pro- and anti- inflammatory balance in rats with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) and explore the underlying mechanisms.Ninety healthy male SD rats were randomized equally into sham-operated group, SAP group and EPO pretreatment group. SAP model was induced in the latter two groups by retrograde injection of 1 ml/kg 3.5% sodium traurocholate into the biliopancreatic duct. In EPO group, 3000 U/kg EPO (1000 U/ml) was administered intravenously 1 h before SAP, and normal saline was administered in the other two groups. Serum amylase activity, interleukin-10 (IL-10)and IL-18 levels were measured at different time points after the operation. The translocation and activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in the pancreatic tissue was detected using immunofluorescence staining, and pancreatic pathologies were evaluated.Compared with SAP group, EPO group showed a markedly decreased activation rate of NF-κB after SAP except for 12 h (P<0.05), significantly decreased serum amylase activity at 3, 6, and 12 h (P<0.05) and decreased serum IL-18 levels at 3, 6, 24 h (P<0.05), whereas serum IL-10 underwent no significant changes. The rats in EPO group showed an obviously milder pancreatic pathology than those in SAP group at 6, 12, and 24 h (P<0.05).EPO can effectively inhibit NF-κB activation by regulating the inflammatory mediators and restoring the pro-and anti-inflammatory balance to alleviate SAP in rats.
