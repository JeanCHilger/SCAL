Does somatostatin analogue prevent experimental acute pancreatitis? Because somatostatin is a potent inhibitor of pancreatic secretion, we hypothesized that pretreatment with somatostatin analogue octreotide (SMS 201-995) might prevent cerulein-induced edematous pancreatitis. We studied 18 rats prepared with jugular vein catheters. The following agents were administered intravenously to groups of four rats for 6 hours: 1 mL/h (control) crystalloid solution 1-microgram/kg bolus then 1 microgram/kg per hour of octreotide
