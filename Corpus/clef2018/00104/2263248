Postoperative pancreatitis following thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysmectomy--a case report. Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysmectomy with a temporary bypass from left axillary to right common iliac artery was successfully performed in a 57 year-old-female with an aneurysm involving celiac, superior mesenteric and renal arteries. An elevation of serum amylase level with a peak value on 7 POD was observed and ultrasonography revealed acute pancreatitis resulting from seventy minutes ischemia of celiac artery during the procedure. The patient was treated conservatively and discharged. It seems to be important to prevent pancreatic ischemia in thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysmectomy as well as to maintain renal and hepatic circulation.
