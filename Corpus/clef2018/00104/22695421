Hydrogen-rich saline reduces the oxidative stress and relieves the severity of trauma-induced acute pancreatitis in rats. Currently, little evidence exists to support whether the therapeutic approaches for treating ordinary acute pancreatitis (AP) are effective in trauma-induced pancreatitis. Hydrogen-rich (H2) saline is an antioxidant treatment capable of ameliorating the severity of L-arginine-induced AP. In this study, we attempted to validate its protective role against traumatic pancreatitis (TP).A previously established experimental rat model of TP was generated by controlled delivery of high pressure air impact. The protective effects of H2 saline against TP were evaluated in this model system by measuring survival rate and determining changes in histopathology, plasma enzymes, cytokines, and oxidative stress-associated molecules.Intraperitoneal administration of H2-rich saline produced a pronounced protection against TP in rats. Significant improvements were observed in survival rate and histopathological findings. In addition, plasma cytokines concentrations were reduced in H2 saline-treated TP rats. Although no marked inhibitory effect on plasma amylase and lipase activities was observed, H2 saline caused considerable suppression of pancreatic malondialdehyde level and recruitment of endogenous pancreatic antioxidants, such as glutathione and superoxide dismutase.H2-rich saline has beneficial effects on TP, presumably because of its detoxification activities against excessive reactive oxygen species. Our findings highlight the potential of H2-rich saline as a therapeutic agent of trauma-induced AP.
