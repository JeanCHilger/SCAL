Development of a novel model of hypertriglyceridemic acute pancreatitis in hamsters: protective effects of probucol. The aim of the present study was to develop a model of hypertriglyceridemic (HTG) acute pancreatitis and to investigate the effects of probucol in this model.Hamsters were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or a normal diet for 3 weeks. Probucol was added at 1% to the HFD in the treated group. Pancreatitis was induced by 7 peritoneal injections of cerulein to the normal and HFD hamster groups. The severity of the pancreatitis and whole body oxidative stress were assessed.The HFD induced severe HTG (>1000 mg/dL) in the hamsters. A more severe pancreatitis was observed in the HFD group. The HFD did not influence plasma-reduced glutathione level, but there was a significant increase after 1% probucol was provided in the diet. Plasma malonaldehyde levels in the HFD group were significantly higher than the normal chow group, whereas probucol administration significantly decreased plasma hydrogen peroxide and malonaldehyde levels. We also found that probucol significantly reduced levels of amylase and lipase in the plasma and pathological scores in pancreatic tissue.This study presents a novel model of severe HTG acute pancreatitis, and our results support the potential therapeutic application of probucol in HTG acute pancreatitis.
