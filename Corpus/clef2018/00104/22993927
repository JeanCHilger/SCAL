Some of criteria in the evaluation of severity and prognosis with different forms of acute pancreatitis. The aim of the research is to improve diagnosis and assessment of severity and prognosis with different forms of acute pancreatitis. In 79 patients were studied levels of leukocytes, lymphocytes, leucocyte intoxication index (LII), the content of lactate dehydrogenase (LDG), creatinephosphokinase (CPK), amylase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST, alanine aminotransferase (ALT).The level of leukocytes reflects the severity of the disease, but had no prognostic value. The level of lymphocytes, LII. LDG and lipase reflect the severity, of the disease and have prognostic value. The level of amylase, AST, ALT, CPK not always reflect the severity of the disease, but had prognostic value.The most readily available to assess the severity and prognosis in acute pancreatitis are the level of blood lymphocytes and LII. Indicators LDG. CPK, amylase, lipase, AST and ALT also reflect the course and prognosis of the disease.
