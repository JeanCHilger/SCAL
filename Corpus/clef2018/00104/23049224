Melatonin attenuates acute pancreatitis-associated lung injury in rats by modulating interleukin 22. To investigate whether therapeutic treatment with melatonin could protect rats against acute pancreatitis and its associated lung injury.Seventy-two male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: the sham operation (SO), severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), and melatonin treatment (MT) groups. Acute pancreatitis was induced by infusion of 1 mL/kg of sodium taurocholate (4% solution) into the biliopancreatic duct. Melatonin (50 mg/kg) was administered 30 min before pancreatitis was induced, and the severity of pancreatic and pulmonary injuries was evaluated 1, 4 and 8 h after induction. Serum samples were collected to measure amylase activities, and lung tissues were removed to measure levels of mRNAs encoding interleukin 22 (IL-22) and T helper cell 22 (Th22), as well as levels of IL-22.At each time point, levels of mRNAs encoding IL-22 and Th22 were significantly higher (P < 0.001) in the MT group than in the SAP group (0.526 ± 0.143 vs 0.156 ± 0.027, respectively, here and throughout, after 1 h 0.489 ± 0.150 vs 0.113 ± 0.014 after 4 hMelatonin protects rats against acute pancreatitis-associated lung injury, probably through the upregulation of IL-22 and Th22, which increases the innate immunity of tissue cells and enhances their regeneration.
