In vitro toxicity and antidiabetic activity of a newly developed polyherbal formulation (MAC-ST/001) in streptozotocin-induced diabetic Wistar rats. The present study was designed to investigate the hypoglycemic effect of an aqueous extract of MAC-ST/001 (a new polyherbal formulation) which was given once daily to rats at different doses. The animals were divided into diabetic and nondiabetic control groups. The duration of each experiment lasted from 1 week to 1 month, and the results were compared with that of the standard hypoglycemic drug glibenclamide (10 mg/kg), which was given once daily. In this study, biochemical and histopathological parameters were studied in streptozotacin (STZ) (single intraperitoneal injection of 55 mg/kg)-induced diabetic rats. The diabetic rats showed a significant (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01) decrease in their body weight and serum amylase with marked elevation in blood glucose, serum cholesterol, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, and serum transaminases (AST and ALT) after 1 week till the 28th day of diabetes. Cytotoxicity of MAC-ST/001 formulation was also studied on C2C12, 3T3-L1, and HepG2 cells through MTT assay. Histological examination of the liver and pancreas of normal control, diabetic control, and drug-treated rats revealed significant results. Finally, it was concluded that administration of this MAC-ST/001 extract reversed most blood and tissue changes caused by STZ-induced diabetes in rats.
