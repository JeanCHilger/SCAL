Acute pancreatitis in dogs: advances in understanding, diagnostics, and treatment. Acute pancreatitis in dogs is a potentially reversible condition, but in severe forms it can cause systemic and local complications. These complications are driven by the cytokine, complement, and kinin systems, with the roles of these systems along with other substances such as nitric oxide being increasingly studied. The intestinal tract and altered pancreatic microcirculation also contribute greatly to the perpetuation of disease. Diagnosis remains difficult, because the true diagnostic utility of the current tests available is problematic to establish. Further understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease has opened up new areas of research into optimal treatments. In particular, the role of enteral nutrition has been the focus of much attention, and current recommendations are to feed earlier in the disease than previously thought.
