Microdialysis in early detection of temporary pancreatic ischemia in a porcine model. Ischemic injury to the pancreas occurs in various clinical conditions. A method for online monitoring of pathophysiological events in pancreatic parenchyma is missing.To assess the timing of microdialysis (MD) technique response on temporary changes in pancreatic perfusion, and to evaluate the relationship between MD data and systemic markers of anaerobic metabolism and inflammation.In anaesthetized normoventilated pigs, MD probes were placed in right (control) and left (ischemic) pancreatic lobes, respectively. Following the clamping of the vessels, ischemia was verified by tissue oxygen tension (P(ti)O(2)) measurements.P(ti)O(2) decreased within 20 min after the clamping of the vessels, already returning to baseline levels at the first sampling point after the removal of the clamp. MD lactate levels increased, whereas pyruvate and glucose levels decreased at 20 min after the induction of ischemia. These trends continued until the end of ischemia and returned to baseline following reperfusion. Serum lactate, amylase and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels decreased throughout the protocol time.MD data were in concordance with changes in P(ti)O(2), which is indicative of local anaerobic metabolism. MD allowed the detection of pathophysiological processes within the ischemic pancreas at a stage when no elevations of systemic markers of ischemia or inflammation were observed.
