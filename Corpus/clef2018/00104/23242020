Clinical effects of bile aspiration just before contrast injection during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. This study was designed to determine whether bile aspiration before contrast injection cholangiogram prevent of post-ERCP cholangitis, liver function worsening, cholecystitis and pancreatitis.One hundred and two patients in the bile aspiration group before contrast injection from December 1, 2008 to December 30, 2009 and 115 patients in the conventional control group from January 1, 2010 to June 30, 2010 were analyzed. The incidence of post-ERCP cholangitis, liver function worsening, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, and hyperamylasemia only were compared between these two groups.In the 102 patients with the bile aspiration group, post-ERCP cholangitis in 3 patients (2.9%), liver function worsening in 4 patients (3.9%), cholecystitis and pancreatitis in none, and hyperamylasemia only in 6 patients (5.8%) occurred. In the 115 patients with control group, post-ERCP cholangitis in 1 patient (0.4%), liver function worsening in 9 patients (7.8%), cholecystitis in none, pancreatitis in 3 patients (2.6%), hyperamylasemia only in 10 patients (8.6%) developed. The two groups did not significantly differ in terms of the incidence of post-ERCP cholangitis, liver function worsening, pancreatitis, and hyperamylasemia only (p>0.05).Initially bile juice aspiration just before contrast injection into the bile duct rarely prevented post-ERCP cholangitis, liver function worsening, and pancreatitis in patients with the extrahepatic bile duct obstruction.
