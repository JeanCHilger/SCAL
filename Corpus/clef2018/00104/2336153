Intramural hematoma of the duodenum. Diagnosis and therapy. Two cases of intramural haematoma of the duodenum caused by injury are examined. The clinical signs were non-specific: vomiting and epigastric pain. The salient features of laboratory tests were leucocytosis and hyperamylasaemia. Radiography of the digestive tract revealed classic bunching of the mucous plicae in the second section of the duodenum in one case and a mark on the gastric antrum together with a clear stretch in the third duodenal section in the other. Surgical examination and drainage of the haematoma was performed in one case while the other was given conservative treatment. Both patients were clinically cured on release from hospital.
