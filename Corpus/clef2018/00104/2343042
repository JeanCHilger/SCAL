Effect of a new cholecystokinin receptor antagonist loxiglumide on acute pancreatitis in two experimental animal models. We evaluated the effects of a new cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonist, loxiglumide, in a model of mild pancreatitis induced by repeated injections of cerulein and in a severe necrotizing form of pancreatitis induced by retrograde ductal injection of sodium taurocholate (NaTc) in rats. A single subcutaneous injection or oral administration of 50 mg/kg of body weight of loxiglumide almost completely reduced the increases of serum amylase activity and pancreatic wet weight, and caused histologic improvements of the cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis when given 30 min before the first cerulein injection. Loxiglumide was also effective in reducing the elevated serum amylase activity, pancreatic wet weight, and histologic alterations even when administered after the induction of acute pancreatitis. However, loxiglumide offered no apparent beneficial effects when given 30 min before and 3 h after the induction of acute pancreatitis by NaTc as determined by changes in serum amylase activity, pancreatic wet weight, and histology. These results do not necessarily suggest that CCK is not important in the pathogenesis of pancreatitis, but do suggest that the sole blockade of peripheral CCK receptors is ineffective against NaTc-induced severe necrotizing pancreatitis.
