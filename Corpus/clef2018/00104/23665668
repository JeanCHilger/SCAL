Hepcidin as a predictor of disease severity in acute pancreatitis: a single center prospective study. Predicting the severity of acute pancreatitis is limited to clinical, laboratory and radiological risk factors. Hepcidin levels increase in acute inflammation. We aimed to assess the relationship between hepcidin and C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cells (WBC) and multi-detector computerized tomography (MDCT) in predicting the severity of pancreatitis.We undertook a prospective review of 59 consecutive patients with acute pancreatitis admitted to our clinic. Biochemical values were measured from blood samples taken within 2 hours of admission and from between 2 and 72 hours related to the time of symptom onset.In predicting severe acute pancreatitis, hepcidin was superior to CRP and WBC (Area Under the Curve (AUC)=0.79, p=0.003 AUC=0.69, p=NSIn this study, hepcidin was found to be superior to CRP in predicting the severity of pancreatitis.
