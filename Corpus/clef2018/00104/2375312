Subcutaneous fat necrosis associated with pancreatitis: histochemical and electron microscopic findings. Subcutaneous fat necrosis associated with pancreatitis has been postulated to be due to the effects of circulating pancreatic lipase. We report positive intracellular staining of adipocytes with a monoclonal antibody to pancreatic lipase in a lesion of subcutaneous pancreatic fat necrosis, and confirm the role of pancreatic lipase in the pathogenesis of this syndrome.
