Acute pancreatitis in children. Lately, there has been an increase in incidence of acute pancreatitis in childhood. Fortunately, 80% of cases are mild and do not require surgical approach. Several etiologic factors have been implicated, such as infections, trauma, congenital anomalies, drugs, biliary diseases. The aim of this study was to assess etiology, clinical features and outcomes of children with acute pancreatitis treated at our center.A retrospective chart review of our cases of acute pancreatitis in patients younger than 16 years old was performed.24 cases of acute pancreatitis were found from 1998 to 2010. Mean age was 8.75 years. There were 7 boys and 17 girls. The main clinical manifestations were abdominal pain, vomiting and abdominal distention. Mean amylase level was 1565 UI/L. There was one patient with normal serum amylase levels. Serum lipase was required in two patients (239 UI/L and 5,980 UI/L). Ultrasound showed pancreatic lesion in 79.2% of cases. Severe pancreatitis was presented in two cases, due to renal failure and pancreatic necrosis. Surgery was performed in 6 cases (3 cholecystectomies, 1 choledocal cyst resection, 1 percutaneous pseudocyst drainage and 1 necrosectomy) Pancreatic complications were found in 20.8% of cases (4 pseudocysts y 1 pancretic necrosis) Several causes were found: idiophatic, secondary to ERCP, congenital anomalies, drugs, infections, biliary disease and trauma. Mean hospital stay was 25.65 days. There were no deaths due to acute pancreatitis.There are several causes of acute pancreatitis in children. Some cases may present normoamilasemia, situation, in which serum lipase and clinical and radiological criteria are pivotal. Prospective studies evaluating etiological factors and incidence are required.
