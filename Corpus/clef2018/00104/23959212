Neuronostatin ameliorates sodium taurocholate-induced acute pancreatitis in rats. Neuronostatin is encoded in the preprosomatostatin gene and exerts important physiological actions on neuronal and cardiovascular regulation and metabolism in diverse tissues. An intraperitoneal injection of neuronostatin can induce c-Jun expression in the periphery of pancreatic islets. Because of the relatively high amount of neuronostatin present in the pancreas, it is necessary to investigate the effects of neuronostatin on pancreas. Furthermore, little is known about the effect of neuronostatin on acute pancreatitis.Neuronostatin (30, 60, and 120 nmol) was injected in to the external jugular vein 30 min before retrograde infusion of 2 % sodium taurocholate into the pancreaticobiliary duct. After 6 h, histological damage of the pancreas was evaluated by pancreas weight and paraffin section. A blood sample was collected to determine the serum amylase and lipase activities.In our findings, neuronostatin groups had a reduction in interstitial edema, acinar cell vacuolization, and inflammatory infiltration of the pancreas compared with the model group. Biochemical data showed that serum amylase and lipase activities were significantly decreased in neuronostatin-pretreated groups by comparison with the model group.Histopathologic examination suggests that neuronostatin ameliorated the histological damage of sodium taurocholate-induced acute pancreatitis in rats. The biochemical analysis was consistent with that obtained from histopathologic examination, which was toward a trend of attenuating acute pancreatitis. In summary, neuronostatin might be potentially capable of ameliorating pancreatic damage in acute pancreatitis in rats.
