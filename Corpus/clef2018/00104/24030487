Comparison of ionic, monomer, high osmolar contrast media with non-ionic, dimer, iso-osmolar contrast media in ERCP. Pancreatitis is the most common and serious complication of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Several studies have compared contrast media (CM) with different osmolalities, but the results are conflicting. We conducted this study to clarify the difference between 2 CM used in ERCP.Five hundred and seventy-six patients were examined by using ERCP in our hospital during 2010. Out of these, 56 patients were enrolled in this study. We investigated the incidence of post ERCP pancreatitis (PEP) and hyperamylasemia. Serum amylase levels were compared in the 2 groups.Twenty-seven patients were treated with iodixanol and 29 with diatrizoate meglumine Na. The rate of PEP in the diatrizoate meglumine Na group and iodixanol group was 0% (0/29) and 7.4% (2/27), respectively (P = 0.228). The rate of hyperamylasemia was 10.3% (3/29) and 14.8% (4/27), respectively (P = 0.70). There were no significant differences between two groups for amylase levels pre-procedure (P = 0.082), 3 h post procedure (P = 0.744), or next morning (P = 0.265).There were no significant differences in the rates of PEP or hyperamylasemia between CMs in ERCP. We believe it is unnecessary to use the more expensive low osmolality CM in ERCP to prevent PEP.
