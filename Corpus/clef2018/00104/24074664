Pancreatic complications in pediatric choledochal cysts. The aim of this study is to clarify the clinical features and risk factors of pre- and postoperative pancreatic complications in pediatric choledochal cysts.A retrospective chart review was carried out on pediatric patients with choledochal cysts who underwent radical operation at our department.Twenty-one, 24, and 24 patients were classified into the Todani Ia, Ic, and IV-A choledochal cyst, respectively. Preoperative acute pancreatitis and protein plugs were observed in 31 (43.7%) and 11 (15.5%) patients, respectively. Patients with preoperative pancreatitis were more likely to have fusiform dilatation of choledochal cysts (79.3% vs. 35.0%) and a dilated common channel (53.9% vs. 23.1%) compared to those without preoperative pancreatitis. Compared to patients without preoperative protein plugs, those with protein plugs were more likely to have fusiform dilatation (90.9% vs. 46.5%) and pancreatic divisum with communicating ducts and a dilated ductal system (60.0% vs. 2.5%). Postoperatively, three patients (4.2%) experienced acute pancreatitis. One of these and all 3 had protein plugs and preoperative pancreatitis, respectively.Fusiform-type choledochal cyst is a significant risk factor for preoperative pancreatic complications in choledochal cysts. While postoperative pancreatic complications were relatively rare, preoperative pancreatic complications might be risk factors for postoperative pancreatitis.
