Significance of immunoreactive lipase in the diagnosis of pancreatic diseases. The diagnostic value of a new enzyme immunoassay for lipase (IRL) was evaluated in controls (n = 65), in acute pancreatitis (n = 11) and in extrapancreatic hyperamylasemia (n = 15) by comparing IRL with serum amylase (TA), pancreatic isoamylase (PA) and lipase (turbidimetrically: TL). IRL and immunoreactive trypsin (IRT) of 60 patients with alcoholic chronic calcified pancreatitis were also studied and correlated with duration of disease and degree of pancreatic insufficiency (based on fecal chymotrypsin test: FCT). IRL was constantly elevated in patients with acute pancreatitis. In extrapancreatic hyperamylasemia IRL was mainly normal, in contrast to PA, which was elevated in 7 patients with macroamylasemia. In 56.7% of all patients with chronic pancreatitis, IRL was pathologically low in association with advanced insufficiency (FCT less than 20 micrograms/g) this figure was 74%, and after duration of disease of greater than or equal to 15 years 77%. For IRT comparable results were found in 79% and 77% respectively. This new lipase test thus seems to be useful for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, the differential diagnosis of extrapancreatic hyperamylasemia and the detection and monitoring of severe chronic pancreatitis.
