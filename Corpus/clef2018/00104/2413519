Indomethacin treatment of acute pancreatitis. A controlled double-blind trial. Thirty patients with acute pancreatitis were allocated to indomethacin suppositories, 50 mg twice daily, or identical-looking placebo suppositories for 7 days in a controlled double-blind trial. The groups of patients were not different with regard to age, sex, etiology, or number of Ranson criteria. The number of days with pain and number of opiate injections were significantly less in patients treated with indomethacin. The median values of serum amylase and serum calcium were not different before or at any day during treatment. Bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract was not seen.
