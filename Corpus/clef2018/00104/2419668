The fluosol-perfused isolated canine pancreas: a model for the study of blood component effects in acute pancreatitis. Blood components have been implicated as factors which modulate organ injury in acute pancreatitis. To isolate these effects we compared a standardized isolated, blood-perfused, canine pancreas model as described by Herman-Taylor and modified by Cameron with a model using fluosol, a fluorocarbon, as the perfusate. Pancreatitis was induced using partial pancreatic duct obstruction with secretin induced hypersecretion. Twenty-four dogs were randomized into four groups (1) blood-perfused control (BPC), (2) fluosol-perfused control (FPC), (3) blood-perfused injury (BPI), (4) fluosol-perfused injury (FPI). All glands were observed for 4 h for mean arterial pressure (MAP), weight gain, gross appearance, and venous amylase. Stability was monitored with blood gases and glucose. Specimens were taken at 4 h for light and electron microscopy.BPI preps had a significantly higher vascular resistance at 3 and 4 h compared to FPI preps (3.85 vs 3.26 PRU and 4.8 vs 3.9 PRU, respectively) (P less than 0.002). Edema formation (3+ vs 1+) and venous amylase (18,543 vs 1961) (P less than 0.001) were greater in BPI than FPI preps. Light and electron microscopy confirmed injury but could not quantify it between injury groups.Hypersecretion and partial ductal obstruction causes a more severe injury in the blood than the fluosol perfused preparation. Changes in the peripheral resistance seen in the blood perfused model lend support to the theory that the primary injury in this model is at the capillary level and is modulated by a blood component.
