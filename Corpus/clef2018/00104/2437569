Interaction between marginal zinc deficiency and chronic alcoholism: pancreatic structure and function in rats in vitro. The present study was done to determine interaction of ethanol and marginal zinc nutriture on morphology and function of rat pancreas. Sprague-Dawley rats were maintained on Wayne Rodent-Blox ad libitum marginal zinc-deficient diet plus ethanol ad libitum and pair fed with animals fed marginal zinc-deficient liquid diet and zinc-supplemented liquid diet with ethanol for 33 (+/- 1 SEM) days. Body, pancreas, liver, heart, and kidney weights were determined, and studies of pancreatic DNA, RNA, total proteins and newly labeled proteins, amylase, lipase, trypsinogen, and chymotrypsinogen were done on pancreatic lobules in vitro. Ethanol feeding independent of the zinc content of the diet caused a decrease in zinc content of the liver, body weight, liver and pancreas weight, pancreatic DNA, total protein, and amylase concentration and an increase in lipase and trypsinogen concentrations and in secretion of amylase and lipase. Interaction of the marginal zinc diet and ethanol feeding resulted in a decreased synthesis of RNA and secretion of newly synthesized protein and an increase in secretion of serine proteases. Morphological studies revealed a reduction in the number of zymogen granules in animals fed low levels of zinc, also with an accumulation of lipid droplets when the diet contained ethanol. These studies confirmed our previous observations of specific injury to the pancreas due to marginal zinc nutriture or to ethanol, independent of each other. Marginal zinc nutriture in concert with ethanol resulted in impaired RNA synthesis and secretion of nascent proteins and increased secretion of serine proteases. These data indicate that altered zinc metabolism induced by ethanol per se may contribute to ethanol-induced disturbance of pancreatic function.
