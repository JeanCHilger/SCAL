Serum human pancreatic elastase I levels in pancreatic disease. The serum elastase concentration has been measured in 25 healthy individuals, sixteen patients with tumours involving the pancreas, nine patients with acute pancreatitis and nine patients with chronic pancreatitis. The elastase concentrations were increased in those with pancreatic tumours particularly when the head of the pancreas was involved. In acute pancreatitis, the serum elastase showed a proportionally greater increase than did the serum amylase and maintained abnormal levels for a longer period. In six out of nine patients with chronic pancreatitis the serum elastase level was within the reference range for healthy individuals.
