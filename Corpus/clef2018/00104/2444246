The effect of severe pre-eclampsia on the pancreas: changes in the serum cationic trypsinogen and pancreatic amylase. In 13 patients with severe pre-eclampsia mean serum concentrations of cationic trypsinogen and amylase were statistically significantly higher at 64 ng/ml and 1.6 mumol/l, respectively, than the corresponding mean serum concentrations in 30 normal pregnancies, 22 ng/ml and 1.1 mumol/l respectively. These rises exceeded the expected increased values due to the slight reduction of the renal function in the pre-eclamptic patients, and therefore indicate a concomitant injury of the pancreas.
