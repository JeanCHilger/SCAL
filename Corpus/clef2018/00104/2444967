Serum pancreatic enzyme behavior during the course of acute pancreatitis. The variations of serum levels of amylase, pancreatic isoamylase, lipase, trypsinogen, and elastase 1 were evaluated in 21 patients with acute pancreatitis. The patients were studied for a mean period of 7 consecutive days (range 5-12 days) after admission to the hospital. On the day of onset of acute pancreatitis, all enzyme levels were abnormally high pancreatic isoamylase showed the greatest increase compared with its upper normal limit, whereas the increase increment for elastase 1 was the lowest. Subsequently, all enzyme levels except elastase 1 decreased in a parallel fashion. On the eighth day of the study only elastase 1 levels were above normal values in all patients examined, while abnormally high values of lipase were found in 85% of the patients, trypsinogen in 58% of the patients, pancreatic isoamylase in 43%, and total amylase in 23%. These results indicate that, for the early diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, the determination of any of these enzymes is equally efficient, but that elastase 1 is the most sensitive marker of acute pancreatic damage in later stages of the disease.
