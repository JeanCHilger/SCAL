Experimental substantiation of intestinal sorption in acute pancreatitis. Enterosorption on the carbon material Vaulen was performed in experiments in albino rats with the model of acute pancreatitis. The application of enterosorbents was shown to increase the percentage of survival of the animals, to decrease the activity of pancrease enzymes in the blood, components of the Kallikrein-Kinin system, proteolysis products. The clinical observations support the expediency of using this detoxication method.
