New approach for treatment of chronic pancreatitis, caused by L-arginine, in rats. Impact of rofecoxib on progressing of pancreatic fibrous changes in the rats in experimental chronic pancreatitis, caused by L-arginine, was studied up. In 60 male rats chronic pancreatitis was simulated, using intraabdominal L-arginine introduction (100 mg/100 g) through 21 days. Rofecoxib (5 mg/kg) was injected during 14 days to rats of the main group after L-arginine injections were completed. In 35 days of experiment the animals state, the pancreatic amylase and lipase activity in the blood serum, as well as morphological changes in pancreatic gland, were analyzed. Application of rofecoxib have had promoted the postponed pancreatic fibrosis formation, the morphofunctional state of pancreatic gland improvement. The data obtained constitute the experimental substantiation of possibility to apply nonsteroid antiinflammatory medicines in complex of clinical treatment of chronic pancreatitis.
