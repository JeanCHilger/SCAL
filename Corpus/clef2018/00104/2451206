Effects of reserpine treatment on dietary adaptation of the rat exocrine pancreas. Chronic reserpine treatment (500 micrograms/kg) of the rat results in generalized exocrinopathy, impaired pancreatic secretion, and decreased pancreatic amylase. These characteristics are similar to those in cystic fibrosis and are the basis for use of this experimental model for cystic fibrosis. Pancreatic enzymes adapt to diet, but it is not known whether chronic reserpine treatment affects this response. Due to the malnutrition induced by this treatment, another dose of reserpine was required that would alter pancreatic function but not induce malnutrition in order to evaluate dietary adaptation. Male rats (100-120 g) were injected subcutaneously daily for 7 days with 1) no injection (control) 2) 1.0 ml/kg vehicle or sham (pair fed-sham)
