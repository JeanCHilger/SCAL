Insulin reserve and morphology of the tail of the pancreas following resection of the head of the pancreas using various surgical methods. Four modifications of dealing surgically with the remaining pancreas after resection of the pancreatic head were compared to each other in dogs. Insulin response and corresponding blood sugar levels were controlled, the remaining pancreas was examined histologically. The obstruction of the pancreatic ducts by prolamine showed mainly sclerosis of the exocrine tissue whereas the duct ligation was followed by atrophy. The free intraperitoneal draining of the duct system showed both alterations, the pancreatojejunostomy did hardly impair the exocrine pancreas. According to the grade of sclerosis of the exocrine tissue, the insulin response was delayed followed by a pathologic glucose tolerance. This was shown particularly for the obstruction of the ducts by prolamine.
