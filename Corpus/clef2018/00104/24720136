Oral feeding in necrotizing pancreatitis. Restoration of gastrointestinal function is a crucial determinant of favorable outcome in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). The purpose of this study was to retrospectively review our experience with early oral feeding in patients with the necrotizing form of SAP. Over the last 10 years, we have routinely gradually increased oral feeds in order to restore gastrointestinal function.Early low volume oral (ELVO) feeds containing 248-330 kcal/daily were routinely provided for all patients to help stimulate gastrointestinal function. Patients who received ELVO feeding within 72 hours of admission were allocated to Group I those who received ELVO feeds after 72 hours were allocated to Group II. The volume and calories of the feed, magnitude of systemic inflammation, levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and lipase, incidence of organ dysfunction, main outcomes, and complications were analyzed.In total, 129 patients received ELVO feedings. The mean CRP level on day 7 was 160 +/- 77.6 mg/l in Group I compared to 200.2 +/- 103.2 mg/l in Group II, p = 0.043. Normalization of CRP below 100 mg/l was observed on day 14 in both groups. The rate of infection and the need for surgical intervention (46.8% vs. 26%) were significantly higher in Group II (p = 0.026). Group II also had longer ICU/hospital stays (p = 0.039/p = 0.002). Overall mortality was 10%.ELVO feeding provides physiologic stimulation and promotes recovery of bowel function, preparing the gastrointestinal tract for low-fat hospital food in patients with necrotizing SAP. The majority of patients required no additional nutritional support.
