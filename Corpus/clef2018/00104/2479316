Radioimmunoassay of human pancreatic amylase with monoclonal antibody. A monoclonal antibody (E-21) was obtained that specifically binds to human pancreatic amylase and shows negligible cross-reaction with human salivary amylase. Using this antibody a radioimmunoassay was developed for pancreatic amylase in human serum. The assay was shown to be sensitive (detectable up to 7 mg/L), reproducible, and specific for pancreatic amylase. In normal subjects, the mean concentration of serum pancreatic amylase determined by this method was 36.3 mg/L with a 95% confidence range of 16.5 to 79.2 mg/L. A good correlation was observed between the concentrations of immunoreactive pancreatic amylase (IR-PA) and enzymatic activities in 20 serum samples (r = 0.97). The concentration of serum IR-PA was below the detectable limit in pancreatectomised patients, and was greatly increased in patients with acute pancreatitis the latter was accompanied by parallel changes in total enzymic activity. In patients with mumps, the serum IR-PA level was within the normal range whereas the total enzymic activity was elevated.
