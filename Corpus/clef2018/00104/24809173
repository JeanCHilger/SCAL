Exocrine function of the pancreas in rats with experimental obesity. The influence of neonatal administration of hyperosmolar sodium chloride and sodium glutamate on the exocrine function of the pancreas in rats has been investigated. It was observed the development of acute pancreatitis under experimental obesity. The cross-section area of acini reduced by 12%, the cross-section area of acinocytes nuclei increased by 10%, the length between the lobes of the gland has grown by 48%. The level of amylase was increased by 43%, the levels of pancreatic amylase and lipase were increased by 68% and 24%, respectively.
