"Left-sided" Chilaiditi sign? A large gastric perforation with secondary pancreatitis. Although the Chilaiditi sign correctly underestimates the radiological presence of air-under-the-diaphragm, in few cases it has lead to delays in the diagnosis of underlying pneumoperitoneum. In this article we report the case of a young lady presenting with acute pancreatitis and radiographic findings of "left-sided" Chilaiditi sign with underlying a large gastric perforation.A 35 year old Caucasian female presented to the Emergency Department with a twenty-four hour history of severe epigastric pain radiating into her back. Stable observations, mildly raised white cell count, increased amylase and subdiaphragmatic radiolucency were interpreted as acute pancreatitis with Chilaiditi sign and treated accordingly. Twenty-four hours later the deterioration of the clinical conditions required a CT scan and an emergency laparotomy that lead to the diagnosis of a large gastric perforation. However, after several days she died of a disseminated intravascular coagulation in the Intensive Care Unit.In our case the young age of the patient and lack of underlying comorbidities initially compensated the severity of the perforation until it became evident from the absent resolution of the pancreatitis. Bearing this in mind, radiological appearances similar to Chilaiditi sign with significant symptoms or signs should be investigated with a CT scan in order to reach promptly a correct diagnosis.
