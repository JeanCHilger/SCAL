Trimetazidine significantly reduces cerulein-induced pancreatic apoptosis. Acute pancreatitis continues to be associated with significant rates of mortality and morbidity, and therapeutic options are still very limited. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of trimetazidine on cerulein-induced pancreatic apoptosis and histopathological and biochemistrical consequences of acute pancreatitis.Thirty-two Wistar albino rats were randomized into four groups (group 1: control group group 2: acute pancreatitis groupIn the acute pancreatitis group IL-1β, amylase, lipase and leukocyte levels were elevated and pancreatic histopathological evaluation revealed a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis IL-1β amylase and lipase levels and pancreatic inflammation were decreased significantly in the trimetazidine group (P<0.01). White blood cell counts and TNF-α concentrations for the trimetazidine group and the acute pancreatitis group were not significantly different. Trimetazidine significantly reduced apoptosis in pancreatic tissues and Schoenberg scores were also significantly reduced (P<0.05).In this study, we showed that trimetazidine treatment significantly decreases the levels of IL-1β, amylase and lipase reduces pancreatic apoptosis and ameliorates the histopathological findings of cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis. Trimetazidine could be a new therapeutic option in the early treatment of acute pancreatitis.
