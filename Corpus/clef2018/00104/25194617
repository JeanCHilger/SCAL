A case of recurrent acute pancreatitis in an obese child. The aim of this report was to elucidate the relation between pancreatitis and obesity in children.We present a case of recurrent acute pancreatitis in an obese girl.A 7-y-old healthy obese girl was admitted with epigastric pain and vomiting. She had prior history of three similar episodes with epigastric pain, and diagnosed as having acute pancreatitis 2 mo ago. At time of admission, her height was 128.5 cm (>95th percentile), weight 35.8 kg (>95th percentile), and body mass index 21.7 kg/m(2) (>95th percentile for age). Serum amylase and lipase levels were elevated, and other laboratory findings including viral markers, autoantibodies, and genetic testing were negative. Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography scan revealed acute pancreatitis with no evidence of stone or tumor. Anomalous pancreaticobiliary ductal union with choledochal cyst was suspected on magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. After the surgery, with supportive care and diet, her symptoms were improved and no new episode of pancreatitis was observed.Our experience suggests that obesity is associated with recurrence as well as severity of acute pancreatitis in children.
