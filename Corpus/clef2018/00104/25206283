PRSS1 and SPINK1 mutations in idiopathic chronic and recurrent acute pancreatitis. To identify gene mutations in PRSS1 and SPINK1 in individuals with early onset idiopathic chronic or recurrent acute pancreatitis.The cationic trypsinogen gene (PRSS1 exons 2 and 3) and the serine protease inhibitor Kazal 1 gene (SPINK1Nineteen patients with pancreatitis (14 males median age 24 years, range 15-48 years) were included in this study, of which five showed the presence of gene mutations. Direct sequencing results indicated the presence of two previously unidentified mutations in exon 2 of PRSS1 (V39E and N42S) in two patients with recurrent acute pancreatitis. Two cases had the N34S SPINK1 mutation. Analysis of the relatives of one patient homozygous for this mutation showed that five of the six family members carried the N34S SPINK1 mutation. Of these members, three were healthy heterozygous carriers and two were homozygotes (one sibling had diabetes, the other was healthy). Another patient was heterozygous for a novel SPINK1 mutation located on exon 3 (V46D). All members from this patient's family had normal genotypes, indicating that it was a de novo mutation. No mutations in either gene were present in the control subjects.Two novel PRSS1 mutations and one novel SPINK1 mutation were identified in Mexican patients with early onset idiopathic recurrent acute pancreatitis.
