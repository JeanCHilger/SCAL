Efficacy of Glutamine-Enriched Nutrition Support for Patients With Severe Acute Pancreatitis: A Meta-Analysis. Plasma glutamine (Gln) level has been negatively correlated with the severity of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). Although Gln is widely used today, the results of individual randomized controlled trials of Gln-enriched nutrition support for patients with SAP are conflicting.PubMed, EMBASE, HighWire, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Wanfang, China Journals Full-Text Database, and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database were searched. Literature published before June 2014 was searched. Randomized controlled trials investigating the comparison of conventional and Gln-enriched nutrition support were included a random effect model using Rev Man 5.2 software was chosen to complete this meta-analysis. The count data were analyzed using the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI), and the measurement data were analyzed using the standard mean difference or weighted mean difference and 95% CI. Heterogeneity analyses were conducted by I(2) testTen studies were eventually chosen for analysis, including 218 patients who received conventional methods (control group) and 215 patients who received Gln-enriched nutrition support (experimental group). Compared with the control group, Gln is helpful in elevating the albumin level, decreasing C-reaction protein (standard mean difference = 1.01, -1.89 95% CI: 0.50 to 1.51, -3.23 to -0.56Gln-enriched nutrition support is superior to conventional methods for SAP, and intravenous infusion may be a better choice for drug administration.
