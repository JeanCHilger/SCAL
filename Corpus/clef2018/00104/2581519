The pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis. The source and role of oxygen-derived free radicals in three different experimental models. Recent experimental work has suggested that oxygen-derived free radicals may play an important role in initiating the early capillary injury in acute pancreatitis. Data from models of ischemic injury in other organs have suggested the enzyme xanthine oxidase is important in generating oxygen-derived free radicals. The present study was performed to determine whether xanthine oxidase is the source of free radical production in experimental pancreatitis. Utilizing the isolated, perfused, ex vivo canine pancreas preparation, three models of pancreatitis were initiated with (1) free fatty acid infusion (FFA), (2) partial duct obstruction and secretin stimulation (POSS), and (3) ischemia (ISCH). In each model, during a 4-hour perfusion, edema developed, weight gain occurred (FFA 120.6 +/- 21.1 gm POSS 44.5 +/- 6.9 gm
