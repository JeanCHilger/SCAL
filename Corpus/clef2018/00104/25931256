Effects of rhubarb on intestinal flora and toll-like receptors of intestinal mucosa in rats with severe acute pancreatitis. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of rhubarb on intestinal flora and toll-like receptors (TLRs) of intestinal mucosa in rats with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP).Healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated into sham-operated surgical model of SAP without or with postoperative rhubarb treatment groups (7 in each group). Rats in with rhubarb group received 10% rhubarb decoction (1 mL/200 g) through tube feeding at every 8 hours during postoperative 24 hours. Serum amylase, amount of intestinal flora, and TLR2/TLR4 messenger RNA expression in intestinal mucosa were tested among 3 groups at postoperative 24 hours.TLR2 and TLR4 messenger RNA expression levels in intestinal mucosa in SAP without rhubarb group were significantly higher than those in sham-operated or SAP with rhubarb groups (P < 0.05). The amount of intestinal lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in SAP without rhubarb group were significantly fewer than in those sham-operated group (P < 0.05) but not significantly different from those in SAP with rhubarb group (P > 0.05). The amount of intestinal Escherichia coli was relatively higher in SAP group than in sham-operated group (P > 0.05) but lesser in rhubarb treatment group (P > 0.05).Rhubarb might maintain the intestinal mucosal barrier through regulating intestinal flora and inhibiting intestinal inflammatory response in rats with SAP.
