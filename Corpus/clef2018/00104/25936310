Treatment of primary hypertriglyceridemia states--General approach and the role of extracorporeal methods. Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is a common metabolic disorder in which the concentration of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and of chylomicrons (CMs) is elevated in the plasma. HTG may be caused by primary and/or secondary causes and affected subjects may express HTG when children or in adulthood. In children and adults a genetic cause may underlie HTG which can be expressed as CMs a severe clinical picture known as Familial Hyperchylomicronemia due to lipoprotein lipase (LPL) or apolipoprotein (apo) CII deficiencies. Genetically determined HTG includes Familial Dysbetalipoproteinemia due to deficiency of apolipoprotein EIII of VLDL and Familial HTG. However, recent data suggest that classical Fredrickson phenotypes describing clinically HTG, which were once considered to be distinct based on biochemical features, have a shared genetic set up. The HTG has been classified according to a recent international paper: mild HTG: 2-10 mmol/L (176-882 mg/dL) severe HTG: > 10 mmol/L (>882 mg/dL) associated to CMs remnants, or Intermediate Density lipoprotein (IDL) like particles, and/or CMs. The treatment includes limitation of dietary content of saturated fat and alcohol, fibrates and omega3 fatty acids. When TG are severely elevated and associated to CMs the risk of acute pancreatitis suggests the use of more drastic therapeutic option such as therapeutic plasma exchange. This paper summarizes the experience with conventional plasmapheresis (Plasma-Exchange, PEX) and different Lipoprotein Apheresis methods with respect to acutely lowering TG levels in patients with normal TG, with mild and severe HTG. Upcoming promising therapies are gene therapy, novel apolipoprotein CIII inhibitors and lomitapide.
