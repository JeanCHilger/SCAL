Morphologic changes of the pancreas in hemorrhagic shock and the postresuscitation period. The canine pancreas (20) in the terminal period of hemorrhagic shock and postresuscitation period was studied histologically and electronmicroscopically. There were detected ultrastructural signs of the plasmatic membranes of pancreatocytes and membranes of secretory granules with "leakage" of pancreatic ferments in the interstitial tissue. The incretion of pancreatic ferments in the vascular bed is conditioned by the elevation of proteolytic activity of blood serum in hemorrhagic shock and postresuscitation period.
