The Decrease of Peripheral Blood CD4+ T Cells Indicates Abdominal Compartment Syndrome in Severe Acute Pancreatitis. Few data are available on the role of T lymphocytes and inflammatory cytokines in abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). We conducted a retrospective study to assess the risk factors associated with ACS in SAP.A total of 76 SAP patients who were admitted within 24 hours after symptom onset in our study. There were 36 patients suffering from ACS and 40 from intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH). On the 1st, 3rd and 7th days after hospital admission, the following variables were assessed: serum value of C-reactive protein (CRP), and the proportions of peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, and computed tomography severity index (CTSI) score were assessed on days 1 and 7 after hospitalization.Compared with the patients with IAH, ACS patients showed statistically higher CRP value on 7th day after hospital admission, proportions of CD4+ T cells on days 1, 3, 7 and CD4+/CD8+ ratio on day 1 were significantly lower (P < 0.05, respectively). A CD4+ T cell proportion of 30.3% on the 1st day indicated ACS with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.774, a sensitivity with 82.5% and specificity with 72.0%, respectively. Sensitivity/specificity for predicting ACS in SAP patients on day 1 was 70.0%/68.0% for CD4+/CD8+ ratio, 72.2%/65.0% for APACHE II score.The reduction of peripheral blood CD4+ T lymphocytes is associated with ACS in SAP, and may act as a potential predictor of ACS in SAP.
