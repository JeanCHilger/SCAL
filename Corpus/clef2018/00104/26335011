Role of Amylase-α2A Autoantibodies in the Diagnosis of Autoimmune Pancreatitis. Several serological markers have been reported in autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) patients. However, only serum IgG4 (sIgG4) is available in clinical practice for AIP diagnosis. Antiamylase α antibodies (AMY-α Abs) have been proposed to diagnose AIP. This study evaluates the utility of AMY-α Abs and sIgG4 for AIP diagnosis.Twenty-five AIP patients, 84 disease control groups (31 chronic pancreatitis, 30 acute pancreatitis, 23 pancreatic adenocarcinoma), and 59 healthy donors were prospectively studied. The AMY-α Abs were determined by homemade enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and sIgG4 by nephelometry.Increased sIgG4 were detected to be present in 52% of AIP, 5% in control groups, and 0% in healthy donors, and AMY-α Abs, respectively, in 76%, 36%, and 2%. sIgG4 was elevated in 92% of the 13 patients with type 1 AIP, but in none of 3 with type 2 and of 8 with not otherwise specified AIP. The AMY-α Abs were present in 79%, 67%, and 75% of type 1, type 2, and not otherwise specified AIP, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of AMY-α Abs were 76% and 78%, and of sIgG4 50% and 94%. By combining the 2 serological markers, sensitivity was 41%, and specificity was 99%.The AMY-α Abs may help to diagnosis of AIP and to differentiate AIP subtypes.
