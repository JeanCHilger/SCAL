Pathophysiological Effects of Pancreatic Sympathetic Denervation in Acute Necrotizing Pancreatitis in Dogs. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of the greater splanchnic nerve (GSN) transection on the pathophysiological process of acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP).The dogs were divided into a sham operation (SO) group, ANP group, and ANP with bilateral GSN transection (GSNT) group. Dogs in the GSNT group underwent bilateral GSNT immediately after ANP induction. The levels of serum pancreatic amylase (AMY), calcium, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HCRP), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin 10 (IL-10), and neutrophile granulocyte (NEU) counts were monitored dynamically, and the pathological examinations of the pancreas was performed at postoperative day 7.All the parameters among the 3 groups showed no differences before the experiment (P > 0.05). At different postoperative times, the NEU count and serum AMY, TNF-α, HCRP, and IL-10 were significantly increased however, the serum calcium had decreased in the ANP group versus SO (P < 0.05). The postoperative serum IL-10 and calcium levels were higher, and TNF-α, HCRP, and NEU counts were lower in the GSNT group compared with those in the ANP group (P < 0.05)Greater splanchnic nerve transection can alleviate development of pathophysiological processes in ANP.
