Different Clinical Presentations of Hyperlipidemic Acute Pancreatitis: A Retrospective Study. The goal of this study was to summarize the clinical features of hyperlipidemic acute pancreatitis (HLAP), and help clinicians understand the characteristic presentations of HLAP.From July 2009 to June 2013, 1073 cases of acute pancreatitis were retrospectively assessed. The clinical characteristics of HLAP and non-HLAP were statistically analyzed.The etiologic ratio of HLAP in acute pancreatitis rose from 13% in 2009 to 25.6% in 2013. Diabetes mellitus, fatty liver, and acute pancreatitis recurrence were positively correlated with HLAP, and female sex, age (>60 years), and alkaline phosphatase level were negatively correlated with HLAP. The diagnostic accuracy of amylase in HLAP was only 40.38%, compared with lipase (91.83%). Different cutoff points of serum triglyceride on day 1 (5.33 mmol/L), day 2 (2.77 mmol/L), and day 3 (2.18 mmol/L) could be used to obtain an accurate diagnosis of HLAP. Higher incidences of acute peripancreatic fluid collection, renal failure, and severe acute pancreatitis were also observed in patients with HLAP.Different clinical presentations of HLAP should be applied to be distinguished from non-HLAP in the clinic.
