Acute Hepatitis E-Associated Acute Pancreatitis: A Single Center Experience and Literature Review. Because acute pancreatitis (AP) associated with acute hepatitis E is rarely reported, we present such a case series.Records of patients admitted with AP to our institution between May 2007 and December 2013 were reviewed. Diagnosis of AP and acute hepatitis E was based on high serum amylase and/or lipase (>3 times the upper normal limit) and abdominal imaging and presence of serum IgM antibodies against hepatitis E virus, respectively. Other causes of AP were excluded by appropriate evaluation.Of 790 patients with AP, 16 (2.1% median [range] age, 25 [16-54] yearsAcute pancreatitis associated with hepatitis E is not uncommon and usually has good prognosis.
