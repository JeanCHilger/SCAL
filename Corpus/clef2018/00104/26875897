Laparoscopic treatment experience of severe acute pancreatitis complicated by peptic ulcer perforation. To explore the clinical effect of emergency laparoscopic repair of perforation and conventional open surgery in the treatment of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) complicated with peptic ulcer perforation.A total of 34 patients diagnosed as severe acute pancreatitis complicated by peptic ulcer perforation were selected as experimental group and a total of 38 patients diagnosed as severe acute pancreatitis complicated by peptic ulcer perforation were selected as control group. The experimental group was treated with emergency laparoscopic perforation repair and the control group was treated with conventional open operation, comparing the difference between the results and the prognosis of the patients.The success rate of the experimental group and the control group are compared was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). While the operation time, postoperative intestinal function recovery time, the time of drainage tube pulled out and the occurrence of complications in experimental group was significantly lower than those in control group. The survival rate of the experimental group was significantly higher than that of the control group, the recurrence rate was significantly lower than that of the control group (p < 0.05). The high sensitive C reactive protein (hs CRP) and tumor necrosis factor TNF-Î± levels of the experimental group were significantly lower than those of the control group (p < 0.05).Emergency laparoscopic repair of peptic ulcer perforation in the treatment of SAP complicated with perforation is safe and effective, which can reduce the systemic inflammatory response and better than conventional open surgery.
