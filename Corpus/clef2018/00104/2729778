Effect of SMS201-995 (a long-acting somatostatin analog) on bile-induced acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis in the dog. Recent reports claim a beneficial role for SMS201-995 (SMS) in pancreatitis. To study the effects of SMS in a canine pancreatitis model, four groups of eight dogs each were subjected to laparotomy and after cannulation of the dorsal pancreatic duct, a mixture of bile and trypsin was infused to induce pancreatitis. Group I constituted the control group and received no SMS. Group II received SMS intravenously at 5 micrograms/hr beginning 1 hour before the induction of pancreatitis. Group III and Group IV received SMS at the same dose starting at 2 hours and 6 hours, respectively, after the induction of pancreatitis. Infusions were maintained until 24 hours after the induction of pancreatitis. Leukocyte counts, serum lipase and amylase levels were obtained preoperatively and at 24 hours. All dogs were killed at 24 hours and autopsies performed. At autopsy, severity of pancreatitis was graded, based on survival, the presence or absence of pancreatic edema, hemorrhage, and necrosis, as well as the presence and severity of bloody ascites. Only on a dog (Group III) died before the 24-hour period. When SMS was used before the induction of pancreatitis, the pancreatitis seen was less severe (Group I vs Group II, P = .022). No effects were found when using SMS after the induction of pancreatitis (Group III or Group IV vs Group I). The serum lipase, amylase, and leukocyte counts changed significantly in all the dogs (P less than .001) with the onset of pancreatitis, but this difference was not significant between groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
