Nilotinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor exhibits protection against acute pancreatitis-induced lung and liver damage in rats. This investigation explored the nilotinib action in the management of acute pancreatitis (AP) and AP-induced lung and liver injury. AP was induced in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats with L-arginine. Treatment with nilotinib with or without L-arginine was applied for 7 days. Marked deterioration in serum amylase, lipase, aspartate amino transferase (AST), alanine amino transferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), nitric oxide (NO), total protein content, and transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-β1) along with pancreatic, hepatic, and pulmonary tissue lipid peroxidation (MDA) after induction of AP while significant reduction in tissues superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH) with marked edema, hemorrhage, and perivascular inflammation with acinar cell necrosis, along with elevated pancreatic percentage expression of TGF-β1 and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), were observed in the AP group. Nilotinib markedly ameliorated biochemical and histopathologic changes during AP, thus preserving the pancreas, liver, and lung histologically through mechanism involving antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions.
