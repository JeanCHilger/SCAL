Possible role of cholecystokinin in the development of acute pancreatitis in rats. The aim of this study was to elucidate whether cholecystokinin (CCK) had a role in the occurrence and/or in the development of experimental acute pancreatitis in rats, and furthermore to find the possibility for the treatment of acute pancreatitis with a CCK antagonist, proglumide. The administration of CCK-8 significantly increased serum levels of amylase, lipase and pancreatic wet weight. The administration of proglumide significantly reduced the blood levels of trypsin, pancreatic wet weight, water content and improved survival rate. These findings were supported by microscopic examination. The results of this study demonstrate that CCK has an important role in the development of acute pancreatitis and that proglumide might have prophylactic and therapeutic effects in acute pancreatitis.
