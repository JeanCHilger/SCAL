A case of salicylazosulfapyridine (Salazopyrin)-induced acute pancreatitis with positive lymphocyte stimulation test (LST). A case of acute pancreatitis induced by salicylazosulfapyridine (Salazopyrin, SASP) was reported. A 33-year-old man with ulcerative colitis was given SASP. Five weeks later, P-type serum amylase was found to be elevated. The amylase/creatinine clearance ratio (ACCR) and serum lipase were also elevated. There were neither subjective symptoms nor abnormal ultrasound findings in the pancrease. Lymphocyte stimulation test (LST) to SASP was positive. Asymptomatic pancreatitis by SASP was suspected and SASP administration was halted. Afterwards the abnormal data became normal. Readministration of SASP because of relapse caused an episode of pancreatitis similar to the first occasion. LST was negative before SASP intake and became positive after intake. Desensitization to SASP was unsuccessful. LST was negative before attempting desensitization and became positive when the dosage of SASP increased to 100 mg daily. This is the second case of acute pancreatitis reported to be induced by SASP and this is the first case in which LST to SASP was described. To our knowledge, this is also the first case in which a positive LST was described in drug-induced pancreatitis. This case provides evidence for the role of delayed type hypersensitivity in the etiopathogenesis of SASP allergy and of dose-independent drug-induced pancreatitis.
