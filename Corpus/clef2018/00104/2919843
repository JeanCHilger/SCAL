Pancreatitis and duodenal obstruction after aortic surgery. Three patients developed pancreatitis and duodenal obstruction after aortic surgery, contributing significantly to stormy postoperative courses. Serum amylase and lipase levels should be obtained in any patient who has duodenal obstruction and/or persistent ileus after aortic surgery. If these enzyme levels are elevated, computerized tomography of the abdomen should be performed to implicate or exclude pancreatitis as a possible cause.
