Study of an optimal biological profile for demonstrating pancreatic involvement in acute abdominal syndrome. The authors have studied several seric, plasmatic and urinary constituents in patients hospitalized for an acute abdominal syndrome to be able to characterize an eventual pancreatic lesion mainly seric and urinary amylase as well as its isoenzymes, lipase, liver profile and trypsin. In acute pancreatitis, the means of the maximal increases of seric amylase, lipase and trypsin are respectively: 10.7
