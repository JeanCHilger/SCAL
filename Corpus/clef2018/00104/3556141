Influence of antisera to pancreatic acinar cells on rat pancreas in situ. For investigations of cell injury during pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis antisera to pancreatic acinar cells were used as experimental tool. Within one hour after intraductal injection of antiserum a strong pancreatic edema was developed. Within 24 h this edema receded to a large extent but at this time there were inflammatory cells scattered in the intra- and periductal region. As a sequel of application of antiserum pancreatic enzymes were released. At 24 h after this application serum activities of alpha-amylase and lipase were significantly increased in comparison to the control and reached that level which was found in a model of acute pancreatitis provoked by pancreatic edema plus short-term ischemia.
