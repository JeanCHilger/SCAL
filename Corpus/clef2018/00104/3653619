Acute respiratory distress caused by pancreatico-bronchial fistula in acute pancreatitis. Apropos of 2 cases. The adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a frequent feature of acute pancreatitis. Amylase and lipase values were determined in samples of bronchial secretions in two patients with endotracheal intubation and under supportive ventilation for severe hypoxemia occurring during the course of acute pancreatitis. A pancreatico-bronchial fistula was suggested in both cases. In one case, an endoscopic retrograde pancreatography was performed and demonstrated a fistula between the pancreatic body and the left bronchial tree. Arterial pH values decreased following pancreatography. Splenopancreatectomy was performed in one case, and necrosectomy associated with left pulmonary lobectomy in the other. Documented cases of pancreaticobronchial fistulas have been rarely reported to date. A retrospective study of 10 patients with ARDS was made among 32 patients undergoing laparotomy for objectively recognized necrotizing pancreatitis. A pancreatico-bronchial fistula could be incriminated in three cases. This 30 p. 100 prevalence has to be re-evaluated in the light of serial determinations of amylase and lipase levels in patients with ARD and endotracheal intubation in the course of pancreatic disease. In these patients, high levels of amylase and lipase in bronchial secretions, the use of iso-osmolar X-ray colloids could be helpful in protecting the alveolar membrane against osmolar injury during pancreatography.
