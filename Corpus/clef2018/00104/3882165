Use of electrocumulation of 5-fluorouracil in treating acute experimental pancreatitis. The effect of electrocumulation of 5-fluorouracil with the aid of electric field of constant current was studied in rats with experimental acute pancreatitis. 5-Fluorouracil was injected intraperitoneally in a dose of 4.5 mg per 100 g bw. Serum alpha-amylase, trypsin, trypsin inhibitor, lipase and total protease activity in the pancreatic tissue was studied as indicator of the treatment efficacy with 5-fluorouracil electro-cumulation. The levels of serum enzymes as well as the total proteolytic activity in the pancreatic tissue were far more decreased starting from the 3d-6th hour after induction of acute pancreatitis in rats treated by 5-fluorouracil with the aid of electric field of constant current as compared with other groups of rats.
