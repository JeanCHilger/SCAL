Effect of somatostatin on bile-induced acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis in the dog. In 21 female Beagle dogs an experimental pancreatitis was induced by injection of bile into the pancreatic duct system. Beside controls, dogs received 62.5 micrograms/h cyclic somatostatin (SRIF) a continuous i.v. infusion starting with a bolus of 250 micrograms 15 minutes before or 2 hours after bile injection. Following blood parameters were determined: lipase, amylase, blood count, minerals, glucose, insulin, gastrin, secretin and CCK. Two controls died within 24 hours, the others were sacrificed after 48 hours. All pancreata were examined morephologically. The controls developed all clinical signs of acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis, whereas all SRIF-treated dogs were in much better general condition. Lipase and amylase increased in all groups. In the controls insulin, gastrin and secretin remained unchanged and CCK rose slightly. SRIF-treatment diminished insulin, CCK and the test meal-induced increase of secretin. At autopsy the pancreata of the controls were nearly entirely apoplectic. The SRIF-treated dogs showed less damage of the pancreas and no severe hemorrhagic necrosis was noted. The beneficial effect of SRIF cannot only be due to an interaction with intestinal hormones. An additional direct protective effect on the exocrine parenchyma is proposed to exist.
