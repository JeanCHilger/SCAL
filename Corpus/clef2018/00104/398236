Congenital cystic dilatation of the common bile duct and acute pancreatitis in children (author's transl). Two cases of cystic dilatation of the common bile duct associated which acute pancreatitis are presented. The correct diagnosis is not made often, because the triad of symptoms is incomplete or the recurrent abdominal pain is not attributed to pancreas, in absence of determination of serum amylase. Frequently, has been noted an anomalous formation of the pancreaticobilary ducts and always a reflux in the duct of Wirsung. Also, it is suggested, whatever the procedure of anastomosis may be, to close the inferior part of common bile duct.
