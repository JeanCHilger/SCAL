The effects of a heterologous antibody against a crude lipoprotein lipase fraction in mice. The antigens contained in a crude lipoprotein-lipase fraction from the Rabbit adipose tissue have no effect on Mice, even after daily injections for several months. But they induce an immune reaction in Sheep, allowing one to produce several immune sera with a high physiological activity, without any specific barrier between Rabbit and Mouse. After total absorption of these immune sera by normal Rabbit serum, the remaining antibodies have an activity against esterasic lipoproteins. Small doses of these antibodies induce in Mice marked hyperplastic and degenerative reactions of the adipose tissue and an extensive lysis of the pancreas. A correlative high lymphocytic activation, producing B and T immunoblasts, is induced.
