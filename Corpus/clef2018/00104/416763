Glucagon vs anticholinergics in the treatment of acute pancreatitis. A double-blind controlled trial. Sixty-two cases of acute pancreatitis, evaluated for severity according to uniform standards, were treated identically except that patients in one group received glucagon hydrochloride (group A) and those in the other oxyphenonium bromomethylate (group B). Each of the two homologous series comprise 31 patients, and mortality was the same for both groups (3/31, 10%). Statistical comparison of both series showed no significant differences in frequency of expected complications nor in fall of serum amylase levels. During treatment, serum calcium levels were significantly reduced in group A (P less than .005), and the duration of the abdominal pain was shortened (P less than .05). The volume of gastric aspirate was smaller in group B (P less than .005), and vesical catheterization proved necessary more frequently (P less than .005). Thus, similar results are obtained when glucagon or anticholinergics are employed in the treatment of acute pancreatitis, although secondary effects differ.
