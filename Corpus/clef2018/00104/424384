Dynamics of the pancreatic exocrine functional indices in diabetes mellitus under the influence of comprehensive therapy. The exocrine function of the pancreas was studied in 52 patients suffering from diabetes mellitus by biochemical and radioisotopic methods. The detected enzyme secretion disturbances correlated with the severity of the disease. Complex therapy, including diet, and administration of hypoglycemic drug and angioprotectors led to an improvement of the exocrine function of the pancreas.
