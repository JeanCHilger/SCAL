Predictability of present outcome and future recurrence in acute pancreatitis. Although acute pancreatitis is relatively common, factors useful in predicting immediate outcome or likelihood of recurrence have seldom been studied in greater detail. A ten-year experience with 389 patients hospitalized for 821 separate episodes of acute pancreatitis was reviewed. The overall mortality was 6.7%, being highest on the first admission and considerably greater for white males. Respiratory complications accounting for 27% of the fatalities were the most common causes of death. The incidence of considerable morbidity was 19.5%. Clinical diagnoses of "shock" and "respiratory distress" were associated with mortalities of 88% and 71%, respectively. The overall recurrence rate was 50.1%, with little variation regardless as to the number of previous bouts. Recurrence was more likely if the patient was black, male, older than 30 years of age, and had experienced a second episode of acute pancreatitis. Admission data aid considerably in identifying high-risk patients in whom major complications develop, who die during the present episode, or who have a future recurrent bout of acute pancreatitis.
