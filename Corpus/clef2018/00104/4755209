Pancreatic exocrine function in maturity onset diabetes mellitus. Exocrine pancreatic function was studied in 14 inpatients with newly diagnosed maturity onset diabetes mellitus. Five patients had clinical and biochemical evidence of pancreatic disease (two carcinoma, three pancreatitis). The other nine patients had no clinical pancreatic disease but all except one had at least one abnormal result of pancreatic function tests. None of this group with idiopathic diabetes mellitus developed any clinical evidence of exocrine pancreatic disease over the next five years. Mild abnormalities of exocrine pancreatic function in newly diagnosed patients with diabetes but without clinical evidence of pancreatic disease do not usually develop into overt pancreatic disease, and are therefore probably clinically unimportant.
