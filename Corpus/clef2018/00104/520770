Analysis of pure pancreatic juice in patients with chronic alcoholism. To elucidate early biochemical changes of pancreatic juice and their reversibility in chronic alcoholics, pure pancreatic juice was collected from 23 chronic alcoholics by endoscopic retrograde catheterization of the papilla. Samples were collected at 1 minute intervals for 20 minutes after intravenous injection of secretin (Eisai, 1 U/kg) and for 10 minutes after CCK-PZ injection (Boots, 1 U/kg). Volume, bicarbonate concentration, protein concentration and three hydrolases were determined. Following results were obtained. (1) Five patients showed hypersecretory state. Four of the five patients showed hyperconcentration of protein. (2) Seventeen patients showed hyposecretory state. Lipase secretion was most frequently affected (94%). Maximal bicarbonate concentration was the next to be affected (82%). Amylase and chymotrypsinogen secretion were less frequently affected (65%). Flow rate was least frequently affected (24%). (3) It was suggested that exocrine dysfunction in chronic alcoholics is reversible in an early stage and that sequence of events with advancement of the stage is hypersecretion, hyperconcentration of protein, normalization of water secretion with a decrease in lipase secretion and maximal bicarbonate concentration, a decrease in amylase and chymotrypsinogen output, and finally a decrease in flow rate.
