Does renal tubular dysfunction account for the enhanced CAm/CCr ratio in acute pancreatitis? To verify whether renal tubular dysfunction may account for the CAm/CCr enhancement in acute pancreatitis (AP), we have measured the renal excretion of amylase, lysozyme, and gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase (GGTP) in 22 patients with AP and in 8 with acute tubular necrosis. While the CAm/CCr ratio was elevated in most patients with AP, the CLys/CCr ratio fell within the normal range in 60% of these patients. The subdivision of patients with AP in subgroups with elevated and normal CLys/CCr ratios revealed a mean CAm/CCr not statistically different. Moreover, no correlation was present in AP between amylase vs. both lysozyme and GGTP clearances. These data suggest that tubular dysfunction does occur in some but not in all the patients with AP and seems not to play a major role in the pathogenesis of the increased CAm/CCr ratio in this condition.
