Serum trypsin-like immunoreactivity after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Serum trypsin-like immunoreactivity (TLI) was studied in 31 patients before and after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. None of the patients developed clinical acute pancreatitis. Generally, the serum TLI peak was observed within the first 6 hours after the examination. Most patients (73%) showed a pathologically high TLI but very high values were not frequent (19%). Successful pancreatic opacification was followed by a significant increase in serum TLI which was pathologically high in nearly all cases (18/20). On the contrary, after cholangiography alone abnormal values were less frequent (4/8) and the increase was not significant. In most patients TLI and amylase responses were in agreement. A significant, though poor, linear relation was found between serum TLI and serum amylase 3, 6 and 12 hours after the examination.
