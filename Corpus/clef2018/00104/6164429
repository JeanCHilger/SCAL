Ionized calcium in acute pancreatitis and its relationships with total calcium and serum lipase. Serial measurements of serum amylase, lipase and ionized calcium were made in a prospective study of 17 patients with acute pancreatitis. The mean serum ionized calcium was significantly below the normal range for the first 24 h and had returned to normal after 48 h. There was no correlation between serum ionized calcium and paired calcium corrected for albumin during the first 36 h of the study, but they were correlated for the remainder of the investigation. Serum lipase and ionized calcium levels were just significantly correlated over the first 3 days (r = -0.44 t = 2.3
