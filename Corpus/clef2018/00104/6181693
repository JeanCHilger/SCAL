Acute hemorrhagic pancreatic necrosis in mice. Induction in male mice treated with estradiol. Acute hemorrhagic pancreatic necrosis (AHPN) is induced in young female mice fed fo 4 days a choline-deficient diet containing diet 0.5% DL-ethionine (CDE). Contrary to females, male mice do not develop AHPN when fed the same diet. For determination of whether estrogens are involved in the induction of AHPN, estradiol-treated male mice were fed the CDE diet. In such estrogen-treated male mice, the mortality rate, incidence of AHPN, and alterations in biochemical parameters of the pancreas and of serum were similar to those induced by the CDE diet in females.
