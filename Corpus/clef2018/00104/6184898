Effect of secretin and gabexate-mesilate (synthetic protease inhibitor) on serum amylase level after ERCP. Complication rate of ERCP is about 2%, mortality rate 0,2%. In about 1% acute pancreatitis or recurrency of chronic pancreatitis occurs. In 20 to 73% a rise of serum amylase is noted without clinical symptoms. In a randomized trial the influence of secretin and gabexate-mesilate (synthetic protease inhibitor) on ERCP-correlated complications was analyzed. Gabexate-mesilate caused a significant decrease of ERCP-induced hyperamylasemias, whereas secretin showed no effect.
