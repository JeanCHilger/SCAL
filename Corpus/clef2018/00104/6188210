Diagnostic value of the determination of serum amylase and serum lipase in suspected acute onset of acute or chronic pancreatitis. In a prospective study the value of serum amylase and serum lipase determination has been analyzed in 19 patients with an acute episode of acute or chronic pancreatitis and in 19 patients with acute abdomen not due to pancreatitis. The concentration of urinary amylase and the urinary output of amylase in the spot urine as well as after a two-hour collection period have also been examined. The normal values were determined in 21 healthy volunteers and the reproducibility of the various parameters was analyzed after 1 hour and 25 hours in these volunteers. For diagnosis of an acute episode of chronic pancreatitis serum amylase was found to have good sensitivity, but a specificity inferior to that of serum lipase. By contrast, the specificity of serum lipase is excellent. Unlike determination of serum enzymes, measurement of urinary enzymes in all variations does not offer any further advantage. Except for the combination of serum amylase and serum lipase, none of the other tested combinations provides further diagnostic information. The examination of spot urine samples is not inferior to the 2-hour urine specimen. For the time being the combination of serum amylase and serum lipase determination is again recommended for diagnostic routine in patients with an acute episode of pancreatitis.
