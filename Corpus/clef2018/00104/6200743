Sphincteroplasty in the treatment of biliary tract disease. A prospective study of 46 cases. Forty-six patients in whom sphincteroplasty was performed by an original technique are presented. In 43 cases the indication was oddian stenosis (associated or not with cholelithiasis or hepatic hydatid disease). Only in three patients a "security" operation was performed. Sphincteroplasty was achieved with the aid of an original probe, and average length of the incision of the ampullary area was 27 mm. The postoperative control, made by tube cholangiography and barium investigation, has evidenced the presence of a wide, open choledochoduodenal aperture. Amylase activity was also followed up in 25 patients. One case of acute pancreatitis, two upper digestive haemorrhages and one case of duodenal fistula were recorded as postoperative complications. Healing was obtained in all patients.
