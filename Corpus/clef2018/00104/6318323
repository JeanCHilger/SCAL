Behavior of the functional reserve of the exocrine pancreas compared to its morphologico-echographic aspect in subjects recently recovered from acute pancreatitis. Fifteen patients, who recovered from acute pancreatitis approximately one month earlier, were subjected to rapid intravenous injection of secretin. Serum trypsin (or rather trypsin-like immunoreactive substances: TLI) and lipase levels were measured serially both before and after stimulation. At the time of the test, the patients' pancreatic ultrasonograms were normal. Results were compared to those in 13 healthy controls. Our findings show that restoration of a normal ultrasonographic image coincides with almost complete recovery of the exocrine function of the pancreas. In fact, though a very slight exocrine pancreatic deficiency persists, this has neither statistical significance nor clinical and/or ultrasonographical significance.
