Gastric trichobezoar associated with transient pancreatitis. A Pakistani girl presented with acute abdominal pain and raised serum amylase and alkaline phosphatase concentrations. She was found to have a gastric trichobezoar with a tail extending to the mid-ileum. The altered biochemical parameters returned to normal after surgical removal of the bezoar. Irritation of ampulla of Vater by the bezoar tail is believed to have caused transient pancreatitis.
