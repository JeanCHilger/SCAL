Critical study of the analysis of lactoferrin in duodenal fluid in the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis. In a prospective study we have measured the lactoferrin level of duodenal juice under secretin plus caerulein pancreatic stimulation in 78 subjects. Subjects was divided in 4 groups as follows: 27 controls, 11 pancreatic disease without chronic pancreatitis (CP), 17 CP and 23 suspicions of CP. Lactoferrin was assayed by radial immunodiffusion and the level was referred to lipase activity. The test was considered as positive when lactoferrin (microgram/ml) X 100/lipase (U/ml) greater than 0.1. No one control subject had a positive test, 2 pancreatic cancers out of 4, 1 acute pancreatitis out of 7, 12 CP out of 17 had a positive test. The sensitivity (0.71) and the specificity (0.92) of the test do not allow us to propose this test as unequivocal in the diagnosis of CP.
