Serum enzyme changes after endoscopic retrograde cholanigo-pancreatography/ERCP/. A wide range of enzymes was investigated following endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatographie ERCP/. Of the 12 enzymes studied highly significant increase of levels were seen in amylase /AML/ and lipase /LIP/ activities. Increase in the other 13 enzymes were slight and failed to persist for 40 hours. The incidence rate of a subclinical pancreatitis-like disorder is high, but typical acute pancreatitis is rare. Likely post-ERCP complications must not be disregarded, however, in selecting patients for ERCP.
