Examination of body fluids. In dogs, the pericardial sac contains about 0.3 ml, and the pleural and peritoneal cavities 0-15 ml of clear, straw-colored fluid of pH 7.4, specific gravity 1.016, protein content less than 3.0 g/dl and cell count less than 3000/microliter. Fat can be cleared from chylous fluid with NaOH and ether. Inflammation is indicated by a cell count greater than 3000/microliter. Amylase levels in peritoneal fluid are elevated in necrotizing pancreatitis. The percentage of polymorphonuclear WBC exceeds 50% in bacterial inflammations. Normal joints contain less than 1 ml highly viscid, clear or straw-colored synovial fluid with less than 1000 nucleated cells/microliter. Synovial fluid becomes flocculent and less viscid in septic and occasionally in immune-mediated arthritis, often with cell counts greater than 75,000/microliter, with 75-90% polymorphonuclear WBC. Cerebrospinal fluid is normally acellular, clear and colorless but may be red, yellow or brown with intracranial hematomas. Viral or aseptic meningitis is characterized by mononuclear cell counts of less than 500/microliter. In acute bacterial meningitis, nucleated cell counts are greater than 1000/microliter, with most being polymorphonuclear WBC. Gram staining of cerebrospinal fluid is not useful.
