Accidental ingestion of liquid zinc chloride: local and systemic effects. The case of a 24-year-old man who accidentally ingested liquid zinc chloride is presented. Local caustic effects included erosive pharyngitis and esophagitis. Nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, as well as hypocalcemia and hyperamylasemia, suggested acute pancreatitis. Microhematuria occurred, but renal function did not deteriorate. Lethargy and confusion, noted previously in another case of hyperzincemia, were present. Chelation therapy was instituted, with reversal of the clinical and biochemical effects of zinc poisoning.
