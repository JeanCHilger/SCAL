Anatomo-pathological study of the evolution of cryonecrosis in the rat pancreas. The progress of a cryonecrosis site occupying about one-third of the rat pancreas and induced with liquid nitrogen applied via a 10 mm luminal diameter probe applied for 2 min was followed. The lesion was not responsible for irreversible functional and anatomical lesions. Blood sugar remained within normal limits. Blood amylase peaked on the 1st day and was normal by the 14th. The treated area shrank considerably and was replaced by fibrous tissue within 30 days. The histological picture was similar to that encountered pathologically in man. Neither chain-type autolysis nor pseudocysts were observed.
