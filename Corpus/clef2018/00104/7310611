Chronic relapsing pancreatitis in childhood. A case of idiopathic, chronic relapsing pancreatitis arising in childhood is presented and compared with the 12 previously reported cases. This entity is a rare cause of severe, recurrent abdominal pain in childhood. The diagnosis is suggested by elevated serum or urine amylase values or pancreatic calcifications. Ultrasound, computerized tomography, or as in this case, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography can aid in the diagnosis. Surgery yields excellent results.
