Serum copper oxidase activity (coeruloplasmin) in chronic pancreatitis: inverse correlation with pancreatic exocrine function. Serum copper oxidase activity (coeruloplasmin, ferroxidase, I, EC 1.16.3.1) and serum  C-reactive protein (CRP) were estimated in 43 patients with chronic pancreatitis total serum copper was also measured in 23 patients. Pancreatic exocrine function was assessed in all patients and compared with the respective copper oxidase activities. The following results emerged: (1) there was a strong positive linear relationship between total serum copper and serum copper oxidase activity
