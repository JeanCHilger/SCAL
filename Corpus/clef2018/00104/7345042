Statistical analysis in the differentiation between cases of serious acute pancreatitis and generalized peritonitis due to a perforated peptic ulcer. Serious acute pancreatitis was considered by the authors as one of the diseases which must be distinguished from generalized peritonitis due to perforated peptic ulcer. An attempt was made to differentiate between these two conditions without reference to two factors, namely amylase value and intraperitoneal free air. Differential diagnosis by linear discriminant analysis, making full use of information such as the history of the present illness, general and abdominal findings and laboratory data, was undertaken. This resulted in a satisfactory predictive value, at least for sample cases. Lastly, items which seem to be important for differentiation between the diseases are discussed.
