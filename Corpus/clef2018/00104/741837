Significance of the determination of multiple forms of urinary amylases for the diagnosis of exocrine pancreas diseases. The multiple amylases of the urine were examined in healthy persons and in patients with acute and chronic pancreatitis as well as with parotitis using the polyacryl amide gel disk electrophoresis. A separation into about 7 amylase-containing fractions was achieved which could be coordinated to the pancreatic juice and to saliva. In acute pancreatitis the pancreas amylases increased, in chronic pancreatitis, on the other hand, they decreased. In parotitis the salivary amylases increased. For diagnostic purposes the formation of quotients from certain fractions was useful. The examination of the multiple amylases of the urine according to the method mentioned leads to an improved clinico-chemical diagnostics of diseases of the exocrine pancreas and gives the possibility of their course control.
