The effects of green tea catechins (Polyphenon) on DL-ethionine-induced acute pancreatitis. The effects of green tea catechins (Polyphenon) on DL-ethionine-induced acute pancreatitis in rats were examined. The acute pancreatitis induced in this study was characterized by moderate inter- and intrastitial edema and patchy acinar cell necrosis. In rats induced with acute pancreatitis by an intraperitoneal injection of DL-ethionine, the wet weight of the pancreas (0.47 +/- 0.059 g/100 g body weight p < 0.05), the serum amylase (10,432 +/- 996 IU/L
