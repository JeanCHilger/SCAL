Therapeutic regimens in acute experimental pancreatitis in rats: effects of a protease inhibitor, a beta-agonist, and antibiotics. The osmolality of contrast injected retrograde into the rat pancreatic duct did not affect the severity of the pancreatitis (Urografin, 1,300 mOsm/kg, and Hexabrix, 580 mOsm/kg). The severity of the pancreatitis induced in rats was assessed by survival rate, histologic grading, wet lung ratio, and serum levels of amylase, lipase, and trypsin-like activity. Rats with pancreatitis induced by retrograde injected Urografin, lipopolysaccharide, taurocholic acid plus enterokinase were treated with either intravenous (i.v.) FUT-175 (Nafamstat Mesilate), FUT-175 administered by retrograde pancreatic injection, i.v. terbutaline, i.v. piperacillin sodium, piperacillin sodium by retrograde pancreatic duct injection, or a combination of FUT-175 plus terbutaline and piperacillin. Survival among the rats was increased and the incidence of pancreatic infection reduced in rats treated with i.v. piperacillin or with a combination of FUT-175 plus i.v. terbutaline, plus i.v. piperacillin compared to controls.
