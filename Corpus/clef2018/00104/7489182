Randomized, double-blind phase II trial of Lexipafant, a platelet-activating factor antagonist, in human acute pancreatitis. The aims of the study were to determine whether the platelet-activating factor antagonist Lexipafant could alter the clinical course and suppress the inflammatory response of human acute pancreatitis. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study 83 patients were randomized to receive Lexipafant 60 mg intravenously for 3 days, or placebo. Clinical progression was assessed by daily Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score and organ failure score (OFS). The magnitude of the inflammatory response on days 1-5 was assessed by serial measurement of interleukin (IL) 8, IL-6, E-selectin, polymorphonuclear elastase-alpha1-antitrypsin (PMNE-alpha 1-AT), and C-reactive protein (CRP). At entry, patients receiving Lexipafant (n = 42) or placebo (n = 41) were matched for age and sex, aetiology, APACHE II score and OFS. The disease was classified as severe in 29 patients (APACHE II score eight or more). There was a significant reduction in the incidence of organ failure (P = 0.041) and in total OFS (P = 0.048) at the end of medication (72 h). During this time seven of 12 patients with severe acute pancreatitis who had Lexipafant recovered from an organ failure only two of 11 with severe acute pancreatitis who had placebo recovered from an organ failure and two others developed new organ failure. Lexipafant treatment significantly reduced serum IL-8 (P = 0.038), and IL-6 declined on day 1. Plasma PMNE-alpha 1-AT complexes peaked on day 1
