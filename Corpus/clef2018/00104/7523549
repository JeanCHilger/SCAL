A new CCK-B/gastrin receptor antagonist acts as an agonist on the rat pancreas. The new CCK-B/gastrin receptor antagonist PD 136450 is of potential value in treating neurologic and psychiatric disorders. We investigated possible side effects on the rat pancreas using acute and chronic administration schedules. In chronic experiments, four groups of rats were given either PD 136450, the proton pump inhibitor BY 308 (in order to induce hypergastrinemia), a combination of both, or control solutions over 14 d. Pancreatic growth, DNA, and protein content were significantly increased in rats given PD 136450 irrespective of circulating gastrin levels. Furthermore, an anticoordinate shift in pancreatic enzyme content in favor of trypsin and chymotrypsin at the expense of amylase and lipase was observed. Plasma CCK levels remained unchanged in this group making a role of circulating hormone unlikely. In order to investigate a possible direct agonist effect of the CCK-B/gastrin receptor antagonist, we studied amylase release from isolated rat pancreatic acini in response to PD 136450 and sulfated CCK8 alone and in combination with the specific CCK-A receptor antagonist MK 329. Increasing concentrations of PD 136450 caused a monophasic dose-response curve in contrast to the well-known biphasic amylase release in response to CCK8. Addition of increasing doses of PD 136450 to a concentration of CCK causing maximal stimulation of amylase release (0.1 nM) further enhanced amylase release from pancreatic acini. The specific CCK-A receptor antagonist MK 329 dose-dependently inhibited CCK8- and PD 136450-induced amylase release. In conclusion, the new CCK-B/gastrin receptor antagonist PD 136450 exhibited profound agonist actions on the rat pancreas mediated via CCK-A receptors.
