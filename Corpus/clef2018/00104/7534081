Acute pancreatitis after liver transplantation: incidence and contributing factors. In order to assess the incidence and possible predisposing and contributing factors in the development of acute pancreatitis after liver transplantation, we reviewed the medical records of all 1832 adult patients who underwent 2161 orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTx) procedures in our center between January 1987 and September 1992. Of these patients, 55 (3% incidence) developed clinical pancreatitis and 247 (13.4% incidence) developed hyperamylasemia (biochemical pancratitis). Overall mortality in cases of clinical pancreatitis was 63.6%. The mortality in cases of hyperamylasemia was similar to that found in the general liver transplant population (i.e., 23%). A strong correlation was found between pancreatitis after liver transplantation and end-stage liver disease due to hepatitis B (30% of the cases, P = 0.00001). Extensive surgical dissection around the pancreas (P < 0.05), the type of biliary reconstruction following liver transplantation (P < 0.05), and the number of liver grafts received by the same patient (P = 0.00001) appeared to be possible contributing factors as did the duration of venovenous bypass and the quantity of IV calcium chloride administered intraoperatively.
