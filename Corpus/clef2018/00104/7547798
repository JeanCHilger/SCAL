Characteristics of choledochal cysts in neonates and early infants. Thirty-six infants with choledochal cyst consisting of 28 babies less than 12 months of age and 8 between 13 and 24 months of age, were analyzed. Characteristics of cases were as follows: (1) they were usually of the cystic type, (2) a huge abdominal mass and jaundice with alcoholic stool were typically found, (3) no symptom suggesting acute pancreatitis was observed, (4) amylase levels in bile were usually low, despite the presence of pancreatobiliary malunion, while other pancreatic enzymes in bile commonly showed a high concentration, and (5) primary cyst excision and biliary reconstruction was the treatment of choice, and could be safely performed with favorable outcomes even in babies less than 1 year of age.
