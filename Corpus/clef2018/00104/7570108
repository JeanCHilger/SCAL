Effect of insulin on the function of pancreatic exocrine. Pancreatic function was determined in the diabetic rats prepared with STZ, a compound specifically damaging B-cells of the islets. The results indicated that in STZ rats the amylase content and the level of amylase mRNA in pancreas were significantly decreased. Studies in vitro showed that the binding of 125I-insulin with diabetic acini was much higher than that of control (P < 0.01). The uptake of the 3H-glucose, the incorporation of 3H-leucine in acini, and the Na(+)-K+ ATPase activity in acinar membrane of diabetic rats were also significantly lower than that of the control rats (P < 0.01). However, the above-mentioned alternations could be reversed by replacement of insulin. These results indicate that insulin plays an important regulating role on the function of pancreatic acini.
