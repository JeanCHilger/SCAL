Serum interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and beta 2-microglobulin in early assessment of severity of acute pancreatitis. Comparison with serum C-reactive protein. The aim of this study was to compare the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of serum interleukin-6, interleukin-8, beta 2-microglobulin, and C-reactive protein in the assessment of the severity of acute pancreatitis using commercial kits for their respective assays. Thirty-eight patients with acute pancreatitis (25 men, 13 women, mean age 59 years, range 16-97) were studied the diagnosis was based on prolonged upper abdominal pain associated with a twofold increase of serum lipase, and it was confirmed by imaging techniques. According to the Atlanta criteria, 15 patients had severe illness and 23 had mild disease. The four serum markers were determined in all patients on admission, as well as daily for the following five days. On the first day of the disease, the sensitivity (calculated on patients with severe pancreatitis), specificity (calculated on patients with mild pancreatitis), and the diagnostic accuracy of these serum markers for establishing the severity of acute pancreatitis were 100%, 86%, and 91% for interleukin-6 (cutoff level 2.7 pg/ml)
