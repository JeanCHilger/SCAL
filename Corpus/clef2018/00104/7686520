Protective effect of lactoferrin on caerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in rats. In rats we studied the effects of lactoferrin on experimental acute pancreatitis caused by a single subcutaneous injection of 100 micrograms/kg body weight of caerulein. Lactoferrin isolated from human milk was given intraperitoneally to rats immediately after the injection of caerulein. The injection of 100 mg/kg body weight of lactoferrin significantly reduced the elevation of the serum amylase level and pancreatic wet weight histological alterations of the pancreas were markedly suppressed. These results suggested that lactoferrin had a protective effect on the biochemical and histological alterations in this model.
