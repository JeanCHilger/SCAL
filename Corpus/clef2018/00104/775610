Serum amylase activity and renal amylase activity clearance in patients with severely impaired renal function and in patients treated with renal allotransplantation. Serum amylase activity was measured in 29 nondialysed patients with severe renal failure, in 24 uraemic patients treated with chronic haemodialysis, and in 29 patients treated with renal allotransplantation. Simultaneous measurement of renal amylase activity clearance (CAm) and creatinine clearance (CCr) was performed in 25 patients with severe renal failure and in 19 transplanted patients. Serum amylase activity was elevated in all three groups. CAm was significantly correlated to CCr both in the group with severe renal failure and in the transplanted group. Unlike in the group of transplanted patients, the ratio CAm/CCr was significantly increased in patients with severe impaired renal function. It is concluded that the elevation of serum amylase activity in patients with impaired renal function is primarily due to decreased glomerular filtration rate. The value of CAm/CCr for diagnosing acute pancreatitis is doubtful in patients with severe renal disease.
