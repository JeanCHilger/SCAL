Nonesterified fatty acids in acute cerulein-induced pancreatitis in the rat. Are they really deleterious in vivo? During acute pancreatitis, experimental data obtained in vitro suggested that pancreatic lipase generates nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), noxious for acinar cells, by hydrolysis of pancreatic or circulating triglycerides. The purpose of this work was to determine whether experimentally induced high plasma NEFA levels do indeed aggravate in vivo cerulein-induced pancreatitis. Anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats received cerulein and were simultaneously infused intravenously with either saline or a triglyceride + heparin mixture (TGH) in order to increase the amount of circulating NEFA. Plasma NEFA increased about fourfold (3.02 +/- 0.28 mumol/liter) in animals infused with TGH with respect to controls (0.75 +/- 0.05 mumol/liter). In rats receiving cerulein + TGH, pancreatic enzyme levels in plasma, ascites, and histological alterations of the pancreas did not differ from those observed in the rats receiving cerulein + saline. There was less macroscopic pancreatic edema (P < 0.01) in the cerulein + TGH group than in the cerulein + saline group. Separate infusion of either heparin alone or of triglycerides alone had no effect. We conclude that high levels of circulating NEFA do not aggravate cerulein pancreatitis in rats and may even induce a protective effect.
