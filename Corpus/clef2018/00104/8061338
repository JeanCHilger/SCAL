Percutaneous CT-guided fine needle aspiration cytology in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic lesions. Cytologic results were retrospectively evaluated in 83 patients who underwent CT-guided fine-needle aspiration of pancreatic lesions during a 5-year period. Sixty seven patients had malignant disease and 16 benign disease. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and diagnostic efficiency of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology in detecting malignancy were 91%, 100%, 100%, 73%, and 93%, respectively. In solid pancreatic masses the sensitivity of FNA cytology rose to 98%, while in cystic pancreatic masses sensitivity fell to 62%. In 18 patients with cystic lesions (12 benign and 6 malignant), the cystic fluid was analyzed for amylase, CEA and CA 19-9 content. Amylase levels were high in pseudocysts and in 4/6 malignant cysts. CEA levels were low in benign cysts, and high in all malignant cysts. CA 19-9 levels were high in one pseudocyst and in all malignant cysts. Tumour marker content analysis enhanced the sensitivity of the cytologic diagnosis of malignant cysts to 92%. FNA cytology is a simple and highly accurate method in the differential diagnosis of solid pancreatic lesions. In cystic lesions, tumour marker fluid content determination increases the sensitivity of FNA cytology.
