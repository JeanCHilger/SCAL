Acute pancreatitis--are there diagnostically and prognostically relevant chemical laboratory parameters?. The diagnosis "acute pancreatitis" is a tentative clinical diagnosis. Pathognomonic and specific laboratory findings are missing. According to the relevant literature, the diagnostically and prognostically relevant laboratory values include methaemoglobin, magnesium and calcium blood levels and amylase in serum and in urine. We investigated nine cases of acute haemorrhagic necrotising pancreatitis. The diagnosis was verified operatively and with the help of computer tomography. Only the calcium blood level has prognostic value. A calcium level below 2.2 mmol/l is an important symptom for prognosis and outcome.
