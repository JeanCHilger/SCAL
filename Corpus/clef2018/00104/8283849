Occlusion of pancreatic ducts in pancreonecrosis. The article deals with the results of treatment of acute experimental necrosis of the pancreas by occlusion of its duct system with Adgenol. This led to authentic reduction of the level of trypsin, amylase, and middle mass molecules and improvement of the microhemocirculation parameters. The microscopic organization in the regional lymph nodes was normalized 3 hours after occlusion of the pancreatic ducts. The ultramicroscopic anatomy of the endothelial cells of the microvessels in the lymphatic sinuses was stabilized, leading to restoration of effective transendothelial transport. The method was used in 11 patients in the clinic. A good clinical effect was produced in 10 patients. There were no fatal outcomes.
