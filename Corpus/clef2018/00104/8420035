The effect of different solutions for organ preservation on immediate postischemic pancreatic function in vitro. The present study compares the effect of organ preservation with Euro-Collins solution, cardioplegic histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate solution, and University of Wisconsin solution on immediate pancreatic function after cold storage at 4 degrees C for 24 hr. Postischemic organ quality of a porcine pancreas preparation was tested by quantification of physiological and biomedical parameters in a one-line reperfusion system. During reperfusion with a constant arterial pressure the arteriovenous flow rate was significantly higher for HTK (5.7 +/- 0.91 ml/min, n = 8 P < 0.05 vs. EC) and UW (7.4 +/- 0.81 ml/min, n = 8
