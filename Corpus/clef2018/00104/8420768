Acute pancreatitis and stomach wall necrosis caused by cholesterol embolisms. A 60-year-old man was hospitalized because of a sudden onset of severe pain in the epigastrium and haematemesis. Acute pancreatitis was diagnosed on the basis of an increased serum amylase concentration (642 U/l). Abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography demonstrated a necrotic zone with central liquefaction in the tail of the pancreas adjoining the stomach wall. Gastroscopy revealed as source of the bleeding an extensive mucosal necrosis at the greater curvature of the stomach. At laparotomy, partial resection of the pancreas, gastrectomy and splenectomy were performed. Histological examination of the resected specimens showed multiple cholesterol emboli in the small arteries of the pancreas and the gastric submucosa.
