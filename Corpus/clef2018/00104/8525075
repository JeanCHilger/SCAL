Influence of thyrotropin-releasing hormone on experimental pancreatitis in rats. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of thyroid releasing hormone on acute sodium-taurocholate-induced pancreatitis in rats. Thyroid-releasing hormone did not change the survival rate, serum amylase, glucose calcium, liver transaminases levels or the degree of pancreatic damage, but reduced lactate dehydrogenase. Our findings suggest that the use of thyroid-releasing hormone has no beneficial effect on the course of acute experimental pancreatitis.
