Lipopolysaccharide induces manganese superoxide dismutase in the rat pancreas: its role in caerulein pancreatitis. Intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at a dose of 50 micrograms/kg increased the activity and the mRNA level of manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) but did not change those of copper/zinc-SOD (Cu/Zn-SOD) in the rat pancreas. Both the formation of pancreatic edema and the elevation of serum amylase during caerulein pancreatitis were significantly relieved in the rats pretreated with LPS (50 micrograms/kg) compared with the rats without the pretreatment. These results support the view that superoxides play a key role in the pathogenesis of caerulein pancreatitis, and that Mn-SOD in the pancreas may work as a defense against the development of this disease.
