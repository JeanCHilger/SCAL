Pancreatic involvement in patients with Sjögren's syndrome and primary biliary cirrhosis. Serum pancreatic enzyme activities, exocrine pancreatic function, and pancreatic ductal morphology were evaluated in patients with one or both of Sjögren's syndrome and primary biliary cirrhosis. Ten of 20 patients with Sjögren's syndrome (50%), 6 of 17 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (35%), and 4 of 11 patients with both diseases (36%) had an elevated level of at least one pancreatic enzyme, including elastase-1, lipase, and trypsin. Diminished excretion of N-benzoyl-L-tyrosyl-para-aminobenzoic acid was observed in 3 of 17 patients with Sjögren's syndrome (18%), 4 of 16 with primary biliary cirrhosis (25%), and none of 7 with both diseases. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatograms demonstrated an abnormal pancreatic ductal configuration in 3 of 11 patients with Sjögren's syndrome (27%), 2 of 9 with primary biliary cirrhosis (22%), and 3 of 4 with both diseases (75%). Only minimal changes in branches of the pancreatic duct were observed in the pancreatogram. Finally, 9-30% of patients with Sjögren's syndrome and/or primary biliary cirrhosis had a mild and intermittent abdominal pain. These findings support the concept of a disease complex, "autoimmune exocrinopathy," in patients with Sjögren's syndrome, primary biliary cirrhosis, and chronic pancreatitis.
