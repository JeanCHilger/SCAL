Effects of cholecystokinin and carbachol on membrane fluidity in pancreatic acini. The effects of pancreatic secretagogues on the membrane fluidity of pancreatic acini were investigated using 1-[4-(trimethylammonium)phenyl]-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene iodide as a probe. Two kinds of pancreatic secretagogues, one category of which induces acute pancreatitis (cholecystokinin and carbachol) and another which does not induce acute pancreatitis (bombesin, CCK-JMV-180, and secretin), as well as lecithin were used to investigate the effect of changes in membrane fluidity of acini. Our study revealed that the membrane fluidity of the pancreatic acini was unaffected by a physiological dose (10(-11) M) of cholecystokinin. However, stimulation with a supramaximal dose of cholecystokinin (10(-8) M) increased membrane fluidity markedly within 20 min. Membrane fluidity increased dose-dependently with increasing CCK stimulation. A supramaximal dose of cholecystokinin also induced bleb formation and increased LDH release. These phenomena were blocked by simultaneous incubation with CR1505 (Loxiglumide), a potent antagonist of peripheral cholecystokinin receptors. A supramaximal dose of carbachol (10(-3) M) also induced increases in the membrane fluidity. Pancreatic secretagogues that do not induce acute pancreatitis did not induce alterations in membrane fluidity. Lecithin increased both membrane fluidity and LDH release. These observations suggest that this increase in membrane fluidity of the pancreatic acini may be related to membrane alteration and to functional damage of the acini. These observations [correction of observation] can serve as a window to detect the development of acute pancreatitis at an early stage.
