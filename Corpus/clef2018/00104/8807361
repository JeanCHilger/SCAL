Human pancreas-specific protein. A diagnostic and prognostic marker in acute pancreatitis and pancreas transplantation. Human pancreas-specific protein (hPASP) is a very sensitive reflector of the extent of pancreatic necrosis on the cellular level, and is of both diagnostic and prognostic value in acute pancreatitis. Furthermore, it allows the estimation of the severity of graft pancreatitis soon after simultaneous renal and pancreatic transplantation.Diagnosis of acute pancreatitis (AP) has been improved in the past 15 yr as new methods for the determination of specific pancreatic enzymes have been developed. However, these enzymes have no prognostic implications. In this prospective study, we evaluated the role of human pancreas-specific protein (hPASP) in comparison with pancreatic amylase and C-reactive protein (CRP) in acute pancreatitis and pancreas transplantation.The study included 40 patients (22 female, 18 male mean age 51 yr, range 22-88 yr) with AP and 7 patients (2 female, 5 maleThe upper normal value for hPASP in healthy subjects was found to be 52 ng/mL. Serum hPASP was elevated in all patients suffering from AP, with a median of 343 ng/mL (lower-upper quartile: 192-478 ng/mL) at hospital admission. In the daily serum monitoring with respect to the onset of symptoms, significantly higher hPASP levels were found in NP compared with AIP after day 2 (p < 0.001). In patients with NP, peak values of hPASP correlated significantly with the extent of pancreatic necroses measured by contrast-enhanced CT-scanning, whereas CRP did not. Six patients of the transplantation group had the same serum hPASP course as AIP, with almost normal values on the third postoperative day. One patient had elevated levels throughout the observation period. This patient suffered from necrotizing graft pancreatitis, confirmed by relaparotomy, and died because of subsequent septic complications.
