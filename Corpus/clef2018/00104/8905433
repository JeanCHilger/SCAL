Hyperamylasemia after cardiac surgery in infants and children. This study was conducted to clarify the incidence of hyperamylasemia after cardiac surgery in infants and children.186 infants and children operated on at Children's Hospital. Helsinki, during an 11-month period were enrolled in the study. Serum samples were taken before and on 3 consecutive days after cardiac surgery at the intensive care unit and before discharge from the hospital.We measured serum total amylase and serum pancreatic amylase with two different assays (1) reduction of salivary amylase from total amylase activity and (2) measurement of mass concentration with monoclonal antibodies.Preoperative values for both total amylase and pancreatic isoenzymes were strongly age-related. At least one of the three tests showed postoperative hyperamylasemia (> +/- 2 SD above starting values of the age group and maximal value > 3 times the individual starting value) in 64/186 (34%) patients. 22/186 (12%) patients had abnormal results in all assays. A more than tenfold rise in pancreatic amylase, suggesting pancreatitis, was found in 14 patients (8%). Mortality was 21% in this subgroup, but 5% in the rest of the patients. Hyperamylasemia was more common after 1 year of age, and after open-heart surgery, especially homograft implantation or cardiac transplantation.Hyperamylasemia is a common finding after cardiac surgery in pediatric patients. Amylase isoenzyme measurements are needed for clinical decision making. Age-group-related reference values are mandatory for the right interpretation of amylase values.
