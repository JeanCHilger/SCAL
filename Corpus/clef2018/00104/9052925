Acute pancreatitis complicating a bone marrow harvest. A patient developing acute pancreatitis with pseudocyst formation after an uncomplicated bone marrow harvest is reported. The diagnosis was confirmed by elevated serum amylase and lipase, and by CT scan. We suggest that the pancreatitis may have been precipitated by spasm of the sphincter of Oddi secondary to opiates administered as premedication and for pain relief.
