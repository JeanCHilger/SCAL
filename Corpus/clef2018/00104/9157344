Cytokines in experimental acute pancreatitis. The authors induced acute necrotizing pancreatitis in Wistar rat by intraductal injection of taurocholic acid (150 microliters or 200 microliters 6%). Plasma values of amylase, TNF, IL-6 levels and wet pancreas weight/body weight ratio have been determined. Histologic analysis of pancreas proved severe acute necrotizing pancreatitis with microabscess formation and beginning respiratory distress syndrome was observed in the lungs, TNF and IL-6 levels increased significantly after administration of 200 microliters 6% taurocholic acid. The authors emphasise the importance of cytokines in the development of acute necrotizing pancreatitis.
