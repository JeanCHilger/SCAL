In vivo assessment of lipid peroxidation in experimental edematous and necrotizing rat pancreatitis. Lipid peroxidation, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis, is usually assessed in vitro or indirectly using antioxidants or free radical scavengers. We assessed lipid peroxidation in an in vivo model by measuring ethane exhalation in two models of acute pancreatitis. Edematous acute pancreatitis was induced by a supramaximal intraperitoneal injection of cerulein. Necrotizing acute pancreatitis was induced by retrograde infusion of sodium taurocholate into the pancreaticobiliary duct. Rats were placed in closed chambers and ethane exhalation was measured in aliquots. Ethane exhalation was significantly increased (p < 0.002) in cerulein (n = 12)- but not in taurocholate (n = 6)-induced pancreatitis compared to controls (n = 12 and 6, respectively). Our results suggest that free radicals may play a role in the pathogenesis of edematous pancreatitis but do not play an important role in the progression to necrotizing pancreatitis.
