Ascites in chronic pancreatitides. Report of 2 cases. 2 cases of alcoholic chronic pancreatitis complicated by ascites are described. Both presented a cystic formation in the pancreas. In the first, a direct communication existed between the cystic and peritoneal cavities with passage of pancreatic secretion and serous membrane inflammatory reaction. The literature shows that this mechanism is the one most frequently responsible for ascites in chronic pancreatitis. For diagnosis, demonstration of high amylase and proteins in the ascitic fluid was decisive. Internal drainage of the cyst carried out in one of the two cases resolved the picture.
