Risk factors in endoscopic manometry for suspected dysfunction of Oddi's sphincter. An increased incidence of pancreatitis having been reported after endoscopic manometry (EM) of the sphincter of Oddi, its incidence and severity as well as potential risk factors were investigated prospectively.Between June 1988 and June 1996, standardised manometry was performed in 207 patients with suspected biliary and 23 with suspected pancreatic sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (SOD). All patients had been observed in hospital for at least 24 hours before the test. The diagnostic criteria of post-manometric pancreatitis (PMP) were epigastric pain and a rise in the concentration of serum amylase to at least three times normal. Potential risk factors for PMP were elucidated by uni- and multivariate analysis.Pancreatitis occurred in 19 patients (9%) with suspected biliary and in 6 (26%) with suspected pancreatic SOD (P < 0.01), 17 of mild and 8 of moderate degree. There were no deaths and no lasting sequelae. Previous pancreatitis after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and the presence of SOD were identified as patient-associated risk factors (P < 0.01 for each). Method-associated risk factors were duration of manometry of more than 5 min (P < 0.05) and manometry in the pancreatic duct system (P < 0.05). The risk of pancreatitis was reduced by simultaneous endoscopic sphincterotomy for SOD (P < 0.01).Specific and often avoidable risk factors for postmanometric pancreatitis were identified: technical procedure, pancreatitis, SOD. With short duration of manometry, avoiding of manometry in the pancreatic duct system and with patient's informed consent for simultaneous endoscopic sphincterotomy risk of pancreatitis may be lowered.
