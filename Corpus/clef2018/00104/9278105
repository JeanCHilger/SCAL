Adaptation of the pancreas to repeated caerulein administration in rats. A morphological and functional study. We studied the ability of the pancreas in the aspect of histological, biochemical and functional changes (pancreatic blood flow, serum and pancreatic amylase levels, DNA and RNA content and pancreatic mass) to recover from repeated episodes of caerulein-induced acute pancreatitis. The experiment was carried out in three animal groups: group I receiving one infusion of caerulein, group II receiving two infusions of caerulein at the interval of 10 days, and group III with three infusions every 10 days. It was found that histological signs of acute pancreatitis after the first caerulein infusion showed regression after 3 days, and the process of regeneration was almost completed after 10 days. The content of DNA and RNA correlated with the histological picture. At this time interval also the level of amylase was returning to normal. Each subsequent infusion of caerulein resulted in less enhanced tissue destruction, but regeneration started later. Pancreatic blood flow was decreased each time after induction of pancreatitis, whereas normalization was more rapid. The present findings indicate that the pancreas adapts to repeated injury, which is manifested by decreased severity of changes, but the process of regeneration is delayed.
