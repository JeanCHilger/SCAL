Effects of total parenteral nutrition using a solution enriched with branched-chain amino acids on experimental pancreatitis in rats. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of total parenteral nutrition enriched with branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) on acute pancreatitis (AP) induced by sodium taurocholate in rats. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) increased the survival rate and serum calcium, and reduced serum urea, liver transaminase, acid phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase levels, but it did not change the degree of pancreatic damage or serum amylase. Total plasma amino acid concentration and the concentrations of glutamate, glycine, alanine, taurine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalarine increased significantly after the induction of AP, but there was no difference between the control and therapy groups. Hyperglycemia occurred during the use of TPN. BCAA-enriched TPN can be used in the treatment of AP with few side effects.
