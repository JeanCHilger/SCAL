Evaluation of ERCP- and endoscopic sphincterotomy-induced pancreatic damage: a prospective study on the time course and the significance of serum levels of pancreatic secretory enzymes. In the present study the time courses of serum lipase, serum amylase and serum elastase 1 after ERCP/ES as indicators for pancreatic damage were prospectively analysed in 46 cases. The elevations of pancreatic enzymes after ERCP/ES scattered in a wide range and elevations occured which were greater than one hundred times the upper limit of normal. A moderate increment was seen as early as 5 minutes after intubation of the papilla. Elevations above the upper limit of normal were still seen at 24 hours after the procedure. The maxima occurred about 6 hours after the procedure. Lipase was the most sensitive among the parameters tested, nearly 50% of the cases with previously normal values revealed elevated lipase after the procedure. For daily clinical routine a single lipase measurement at 2 hours after the beginning of the ERCP/ES provides valuable information for planning further surveillance. Younger age and high calcium levels seem to be risk factors for ERCP/ES-induced pancreatic damage. The time course of serum lipase seems to be a more reliable criterion for ERCP/ES-induced pancreatic damage than the poorly defined complication of post-ERCP pancreatitis . The high incidence of a measurable pancreatic injury after ERCP/ES provides a sensitive tool for the testing of drugs claimed to be protective for the pancreas and for evaluating new ERCP/ES techniques. Measurement of the serum lipase before, 8 and 24 hours after the procedure, and a detailed description of degree and duration of pain, are necessary for such studies.
