Hyperamylasemia associated with gonococcal salpingitis and perihepatitis. A case of hyperamylasemia associated with gonococcal salpingitis and perihepatitis (Fitzhugh-Curtis syndrome) is reported. Other potential causes of hyperamylasemia such as pancreatic, parotic, biliary, or intestinal disease were carefully excluded. In addition, the amylase to creatinine clearance ratio was within normal limits, suggesting tubal rather than pancreatic source of hyperamylasemia. This finding is of clinical importance since acute salpingitis is a prevalent disease and its initial presentation may mimic acute pancreatitis or other causes of surgical abdomen. The amylase to creatinine clearance ratio is of value in differentiating such cases from those with hyperamylasemia due to pancreatitis.
