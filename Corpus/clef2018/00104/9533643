Effects of high dose octreotide on retrograde bile salt-induced pancreatitis in rats. The effects of somatostatin and octreotide (a long acting somatostatin analogue) in acute pancreatitis are inconclusive. This study examined the prophylactic and therapeutic effects of different doses of octreotide on retrograde sodium taurodeoxycholate-induced acute necrotizing pancreatitis in rats. The rats were divided into 4 groups receiving subcutaneous injection of saline, octreotide 10 microg/kg, 20 microg/kg at 0, 8 and 16 h and octreotide 20 microg/kg at 5, 13 and 21 h, separately. The serum levels of amylase and lipase, pancreatic histopathology, mortality and hemodynamics were examined. Octreotide significantly reduced serum levels of amylase and lipase at 12 h and the degree of pancreatic edema, necrosis and hemorrhage at 18-24 h as compared to the control group. Prophylactic octreotide 10 microg/kg significantly decreased the 24-h mortality from 100% to 44.4% (p < 0.05). The 24-h mortality further reduced to 12.5% and 10% with prophylactic and therapeutic octreotide 20 microg/kg, respectively. The decrease of mean arterial pressure at 12 h was significantly lower in octreotide groups than in the control group. We conclude that octreotide improves pancreatic histopathology and survival in acute necrotizing pancreatitis in rats.
