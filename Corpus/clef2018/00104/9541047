Acute chemical pancreatitis associated with nonfatal strychnine poisoning. An 18-year-old female who accidentally ingested strychnine developed chemical pancreatitis in addition to the classical clinical picture of strychnine poisoning. Many drugs or chemicals have been reported to be associated with pancreatitis however, this paper provides us with the first evidence that acute pancreatitis may follow strychnine poisoning. The patient survived despite the development of seizures, lactic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, and pulmonary infiltrates. Toxicology testing confirmed the presence of strychnine in blood (2.17 mg/L), gastric aspirate, and urine. Attention is drawn to the fact that survival can follow the ingestion of large doses of strychnine providing there is no delay in diagnosis and treatment. The pathophysiologic mechanism of chemical pancreatitis is discussed.
