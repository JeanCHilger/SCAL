Serum amylase determinations and amylase to creatinine clearance ratios in patients with chronic renal insufficiency. Patients with severe chronic renal failure may have significant hyperamylasemia in the absence of clinical symptoms or signs of acute pancreatitis. Amylase to creatinine clearance (CA/CC) ratios were usually elevated in patients with chronic renal failure and were not helpful in evaluating the possibility of acute pancreatitis. The mean amylase to creatinine clearance ratio for the controls with normal renal function was 1.24 +/- 0.13. In patients with chronic renal failure, it was 3.17 +/- 0.42 (P less than 0.001). Serum amylase isoenzyme patterns revealed no difference in salivary to pancreatic isoenzyme ratios between normals (1.04 +/- 0.12) and patients with severe renal insufficiency without evidence of pancreatic disease (1.07 +/- 0.13). The isoenzymes were helpful in excluding the diagnosis of pancreatic in 1 renal failure patient whose hyperamylasemia was primarily salivary in origin and in confirming the diagnosis in another who had only a pancreatic band.
