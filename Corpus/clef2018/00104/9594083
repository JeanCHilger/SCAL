Neopterin plasma concentrations predict the course of severe acute pancreatitis. In a prospective, descriptive study in 25 patients with acute pancreatitis neopterin plasma concentrations were found to be associated with the severity of the disease, which was assessed using weights of the worst 17 physiological abnormalities of the APACHE-III score over a 24 h-period after hospital admission. Neopterin concentrations were higher in severe pancreatitis (n = 10) compared to mild disease, and there existed a positive exponential correlation between neopterin and the Acute Physiology Score (r = 0.66). Higher neopterin concentrations were associated with the development of multiple organ failure (p = 0.012) and death (p = 0.019). At a cut-off concentration of 12 nmol/l the sensitivity (80%) and specificity (100%) of neopterin for the discrimination between mild and severe clinical course of pancreatitis was more accurate than C-reactive protein at a risk threshold of 1.2 g/l (70% and 87%). Development of pancreatic necrosis was associated with higher neopterin concentrations than edematous pancreatitis (p < 0.001).
