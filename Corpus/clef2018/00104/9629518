Prevention of hyperlipidemic acute pancreatitis during pregnancy with medium-chain triglyceride nutritional support. A combination of diet therapy, nutritional support with medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), and well-planned preterm Cesarean delivery on demand is an effective measure to prevent gestational hyperlipidemic pancreatitis and leads to successful childbirth.Prevention and therapy of gestational hyperlipidemic pancreatitis are important, although difficult, because the condition carries a high maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality.We describe a 32-yr-old female with lipoprotein lipase-deficient familial hypertriglyceridemia who had recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis. The third episode occurred with worsened hyperlipidemia 7 yr earlier at 32 wk of her first pregnancy and resulted in fetal death. The fourth and fifth episodes were also accompanied by marked hyperlipidemia probably caused by drug discontinuance and dietary noncompliance. She became pregnant. Serum triglyceride levels were controlled below 2000 mg/dL by strict monitoring with low-fat, low-calorie diet and MCT nutritional support. A premature but healthy infant was born by Cesarean delivery at 36 wk of gestation when the mother presented with mild abdominal pain and was found to have uterine contractions. The ensuing clinical course has been uneventful.
