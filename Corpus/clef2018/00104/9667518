Premature trypsinogen activation during cerulein pancreatitis in rats occurs inside pancreatic acinar cells. Although it is widely accepted that trypsinogen activation is an initiating event in the development of acute pancreatitis, its location inside the pancreas is not known. In our studies, acute edematous pancreatitis was induced in rats by one or two intraperitoneal injections of 50 microg cerulein/kg body weight. The pancreas was removed for examination 1 or 2 h after the first and the second cerulein injection, respectively. The cleavage product of trypsinogen activation, trypsinogen activation peptide, was specifically labeled on pancreatic tissue sections by a corresponding antibody, the signal enhanced by a biotin-avidin conjugate, and the site then visualized by coupled peroxidase activity on diaminobenzidine. The sections were examined by light microscopy. Trypsinogen activation peptide, reflecting activation of the pancreatic digestive enzyme trypsinogen, was detected inside pancreatic acinar cells in this animal model of acute pancreatitis. As early as 1 h after the first injection of cerulein, protease activation was seen within the apical pole of acinar cells. Protease activation was increased 2 h after the latter of two injections of cerulein and more evenly distributed within the cells. For the first time morphologic evidence confirms that the activation originates within the acinar cell, rather than from the interstitium or the duct lumen. The location of this activation at the apical site of the acinar cell indicates its origin from subcellular compartments involving the late steps in the secretory pathway.
