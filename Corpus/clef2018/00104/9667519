Hyperbaric oxygen therapy attenuates pancreatic microcirculatory derangement and lung edema in an acute experimental pancreatitis model in rats. This study was designed to investigate hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy as a treatment for managing animals with induced acute pancreatitis. Forty-five anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats were studied. A severe acute pancreatitis model was established by combining an intravenous infusion of cerulein (15 microg/kg/h) and an intraductal injection of 0.1 ml of glycodeoxycholic acid (5 mM). Pathology, serum amylase level, pancreatic malondiadehyde levels and water content of the lungs and the pancreas were used to evaluate the severity of disease. Moreover, an in vivo microscopic technique was used to investigate microcirculatory derangement in the pancreas, i.e., flow velocity and leukocytes sticking in postcapillary venules. HBO was delivered in three regimens, i.e., 100% oxygen at 2.5 absolute atmospheric pressure (AAP), 40% oxygen at 2.5 AAP, and 100% oxygen at 1 AAP, 6 h after the initiation of induction of acute pancreatitis. All animals survived until the end of the experiments. HBO significantly improved the pathologic conditions and pancreatic malondiadehyde levels. Concomitantly, it also significantly lessened the severity of lung edema and improved the microcirculatory environment in the pancreas. Our results support the findings that HBO therapy has a beneficial effect on pancreatic microcirculation and lung edema during acute pancreatitis in rats.
