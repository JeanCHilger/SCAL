Enteric duplications of the pancreatic head: definitive management by local resection. Enteric duplications can occur throughout the entire alimentary tract. When they occur in the pancreatic head, they present a formidable challenge in both diagnosis and treatment. Surgical management has ranged from simple drainage to local excision or radical resection (eg, Whipple procedure). The authors propose that with identification of the local anatomic relationships, definitive management can be achieved by complete local resection of the cyst mucosa.The authors have treated four patients, ages 13 months to 4 years for enteric duplication cysts within the pancreatic head.Clinical presentations were quite varied, including pancreatitis (n = 2), gastritis (secondary to increased production of gastrin), and recurrent pleural effusion with high amylase content. Two of the four cysts had been drained initially using Roux-en-Y cystenterostomies. Our preoperative imaging studies included abdominal ultrasonography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), angiography, computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning. When necessary intraoperatively, ultrasonography was used for cyst localization and transduodenal pancreatography to define precise ductal relationships. All four duplication cysts were completely excised, including two that communicated directly with the main pancreatic duct. One of the latter extended into the pleural cavity and required a thoracotomy for complete excision. Pathological exam of the excised cysts demonstrated gastric, duodenal, or respiratory mucosa. All four patients have remained entirely asymptomatic during a follow-up of 2 to 7 years postoperatively.The authors conclude that complete local resection of enteric duplication cysts in the pancreatic head can be performed for definitive management, avoiding the complications of more radical procedures.
