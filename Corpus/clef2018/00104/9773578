Macroamylasemia in a man from Bangladesh. A case report. A 30-year-old man from Bangladesh was admitted to the hospital because of abdominal pain. Elevated amylase values (both pancreatic and non-pancreatic fractions) indicated a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis although all tests conducted to confirm this were negative. Amylase isoenzyme electrophoresis disclosed an immunocomplex made up of a salivary amylase molecule with an IgA that increased total and pancreatic fractions. A diagnosis of macroamylasemia was made. Although this is considered to be a benign condition, it is generally identified only after a long series of tests which could be avoided by the use of simple amylase isoenzyme electrophoresis.
