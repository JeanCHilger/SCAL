Effects of a new cholecystokinin antagonist, TS-941, on experimental acute pancreatitis in rats. The effects of a new benzodiazepine-derivative, cholecystokinin receptor antagonist, TS-941, on experimental acute pancreatitis were studied in rats. Hemorrhagic pancreatitis was induced by an infusion of a mixture of trypsin and taurocholate into the pancreatic duct. Edematous pancreatitis was induced by intraperitoneal injection of 40 microg/kg body weight of cerulein at 0 and 1 h after the start of the experiment. TS-941 (3 mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously immediately and 3 h after the induction of pancreatitis. In trypsin-taurocholate-induced pancreatitis, TS-941, with or without the synthetic trypsin inhibitor ONO-3403, had no beneficial effects on the survival rate, pancreatic wet weight, and serum pancreatic enzymes. In cerulein-induced pancreatitis, the treatment with TS-941 significantly reduced the increases of pancreatic wet weight and serum amylase and lipase. Plasma trypsinogen activation peptide (TAP) significantly rose 1 h after the first injection of cerulein. TS-941 inhibited the liberation of TAP in cerulein-induced pancreatitis. These results show that TS-941 is effective for prevention of cerulein-induced edematous pancreatitis. ONO-3403 has beneficial effects on trypsin-taurocholate-induced hemorrhagic pancreatitis, but the combination of TS-941 and ONO-3403 has no additive effect.
