Vascular permeability induced by pancreatic exudate formed during acute pancreatitis in dogs. Acute pancreatitis was produced in five dogs by injecting bile into the pancreatic duct. The capillary permeability effects of the exudate formed within the peritoneal cavity were studied by injecting the exudate intradermally into puppies. The amount of radioactively labeled albumin escaping from the circulation and appearing at the intradermal injection site was used as a measure of capillary permeability. It was observed that the peritoneal exudate, especially that produced in the early stage of bile induced pancreatitis, contains one or more substances which result in an increased capillary permeability when injected intradermally into puppies.
