Amylase activity of parotid saliva in acute and chronic pancreatitis. The activity of the alpha-amylase was estimated in the parotid resting saliva of 17 subjects without evidence of pancreatic disease, 17 patients with chronic relapsing pancreatitis in the intervals between acute attacks, and also in 4 patients with acute pancreatitis and 3 patients with an acute attack of chronic relapsing pancreatitis. In the patients with chronic relapsing pancreatitis between attacks the concentration, output and specific activity of the salivary amylase were significantly lowered. The patients with acute pancreatitis exhibited salivary amylase concentrations in the uppper normal to grossly supranormal range, whereas those of the patients with acute attacks of chronic relapsing pancreatitis were distinctly reduced. Unlike the amylase output, the amylase concentration was independent of the rate of salivary flow. Simultaneous infusion of secretin and pancreozymin produced a significant increase in the parotid salivary amylase levels in both the patients without pancreatic disease and in those with chronic relapsing pancreatitis between acute attacks.
