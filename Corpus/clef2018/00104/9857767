Chronic pancreatitis: nutrition and pain therapy. Therapy of chronic pancreatitis rests on five arms: Avoidance of alcohol, treatment of pain, replacement therapy for exocrine and endocrine insufficiency and adequate nutrition. Alcohol withdrawal improves pain and the patient's compliance. It also seems to retard the chronic inflammatory process. Therapy of pain depends on the pathomechanism of pain. There is a lack of prospective, controlled studies comparing various treatment regimens. Thus, treatment options are partly dependent on the experience of the physician taking care of the patient and include i.e. for pseudocysts: surgical vs percutaneous or endoscopic drainage for stenosis of the main pancreatic duct close to the papilla: surgical vs endoscopic drainage (stents)
