Trypsinogen activation peptides (TAP) in peritoneal fluid as predictors of late histopathologic injury in necrotizing pancreatitis of the rat. The levels of trypsinogen activation peptides (TAP) were quantified by ELISA immunoassay in acute pancreatitis of the rat and compared to the degree of late histopathological sequelae and exocrine functional impairment 4 and 12 weeks after the acute phase of the disease. For this purpose acute pancreatitis of different severity was induced using a suitable rat model recently described. Forty five surviving animals were studied. The level of TAP in peritoneal exudate measured 3 and 6 hr after pancreatitis induction correlated well with the amount of the late histopathological injury at the end of the corresponding observation period (at 4 weeks after 3 hr: r = 0.75, P = 0.003, after 6 hr: r = 0.72, P = 0.005, Pearson and at 12 weeks after 3 hr: r = 0.86, P = 0.0001, after 6 hr: r = 0.84, P = 0.0001, Pearson). A negative correlation of TAP with the impairment of exocrine function was found only at 4 weeks for the secretion of total protein (r = -0.76 after 3 hr
