Endothelin-1 is a candidate mediating intestinal dysmotility in patients with acute pancreatitis. We studied whether gastrointestinal transit was disturbed during acute pancreatitis and attempted to identify which mechanisms might be involved in acute pancreatitis. Using a noninvasive hydrogen breath test to determine the orocecal transit time, 24 patients with the clinical diagnosis of acute pancreatitis were enrolled into the intestinal motility study. Orocecal transit time was measured twice in all patients: once at the acute stage and once at recovery. Blood was obtained to study amylase, lipase, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and endothelin-1 and nitrate/nitrite levels. Orocecal transit times measured at the acute stage were significantly delayed compared with those at recovery (mean values +/- SEM, 130.0 +/- 9.0 vs 80.8 +/- 7.4 min, P < 0.001). Plasma endothelin-1 levels exhibited a positive correlation with orocecal transit times in the acute stage (r = 0.509, P = 0.011). The percentages of altered orocecal transit times also correlated with the percentages of altered plasma endothelin-1 levels (r = 0.751, P < 0.001). Plasma nitrate/nitrite levels significantly decreased at the acute stage compared with those at recovery (5.25 +/- 0.82 vs 10.20 +/- 1.24 microM, P < 0.05). We conclude that intestinal transit is delayed in patients with mild to moderate acute pancreatitis. Elevated plasma endothelin-1 levels in the acute stage may be one mechanism mediating intestinal dysmotility.
