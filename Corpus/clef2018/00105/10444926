Functional results of experimental autologous transplantation of the pancreas. The autotransplant of the left lobe of the pancreas in the latero-cervical region has been successfully performed in 38 adult beagles with a mean cold ischemia time of 52 minutes. Juice volume and amylase, protein and bicarbonate outputs were resumed postoperatively as soon as 6 hours. A single case of thrombosis of the mesenteric vein occurred all other pancreatic grafts showed good histological vitality at 30 days. This procedure of autografting is proposed as a valid experimental model for the pathophysiologic study of acute pancreatitis.
