Hyperlipemic pancreatitis: clinical course. Acute pancreatitis is one of the complications associated with severe primary and secondary hypertriglyceridemia. The frequency of hypertriglyceridemia in patients with pancreatitis ranges from 4 to 53%. The elevation in serum triglycerides probably induces the release of free fatty acids, responsible for the pancreatic damage. During a three year study, nine patients with acute pancreatitis due to hypertriglyceridemia were followed up at the University Hospital of Federal University and at the "Hospital Monte Sinai" (Juiz de Fora, MG, Brazil). Suggestive clinical manifestations, especially superior abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and ileus, were found in all the patients however, only three showed elevated serum amylase levels. All had triglyceride levels above 1000 mg/dl (11.3 mmol/L). The evolution after clinical treatment was good in eight patients (two needed parenteral nutrition). The only death observed was due to shock and acute respiratory distress, refractory to clinical management. The maintenance treatment aimed at withdrawing the predisposing conditions and reduction of the triglyceride levels prevented recurrence of acute pancreatitis episodes during the 23 months of follow-up.
