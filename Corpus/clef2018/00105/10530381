Results of studies of carbohydrate metabolism and ultrasonography of the pancreas in man after continuous anti-orthostatic hypokinesia. Data on the hypokinesia-induced transformation of the glycemic profile and ultrasonic changes in the pancreas structure are presented. The AOH study gave further evidence of transforming glycemic curves. Moreover, increased sizes of tail and head of the pancreas and a decrease in its echogeneity were observed in all test-subjects. Structural changes in the pancreas were confirmed by biochemical investigations which revealed increased levels of blood enzymes and activation of insulin secretion. Increases in the liver size, thickness of the wall of the stomach, diameter of the splenic vein were indicative of progressing venous plethora in the portal vein system. It was shown that venous plethora are the main cause for changes in the upper GI, and in the pancreas state in particular, which can be qualified as dysfunctional. These structural changes in the pancreas could suppress its functional activity manifested by increases in blood enzymes and hormones and transformation of the glycemic profile during the glucose load.
