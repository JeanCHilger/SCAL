Jejunal feeding in necrotising acute pancreatitis--a retrospective study. The acute necrotising pancreatitis is the most serious form of pancreatic inflammatory disease leading to multiorgan failure and high (15-20%) mortality. The poor nutritional and metabolic condition and secondary bacterial translocation rise the mortality further on. A newly introduced clinical method of continuous nasojejunal feeding-based on experimental works--resulted in lower mortality rate (less than 4%) by perfusing adequate nutrients into the second loop of jejunum via a feeding tube. The better nutritional and immunological status of the patients, with restored absorption and intestinal motility promoted recovery, and prevented the septic complications. Although in some cases with serious progression operation became necessary the timing of surgery was easier because of the less fragile state of the patient. The continuous nasojejunal feeding is a promising new method among the therapeutic modalities of the acute pancreatitis.
