Jejunal limb obstruction caused by a cholesterol stone 15 years after a total gastrectomy and 20 years after a cholecystectomy: report of a case. We present herein the rare case of a 74-year-old woman found to have jejunal limb obstruction caused by a cholesterol stone 15 years after a total gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y anastomosis, and 20 years after a cholecystectomy. The patient complained of repeated episodes of upper abdominal distress on three separate occasions over a period of 20 months, and jejunal limb obstruction was diagnosed by abdominal computed tomography scanning and (99m)Tc scintigraphy. Surgery revealed a stone incarcerated in the jejunal limb, where the anastomosis had become slightly stenotic. The removed stone was 3.5 cm in diameter and was subsequently demonstrated to be a cholesterol stone by chemical analysis. This report is thought to be the first to describe jejunal limb obstruction caused by a gallstone incarcerated in the jejunal limb after a total gastrectomy in a patient with a history of cholecystectomy.
