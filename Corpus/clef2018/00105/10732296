A case of acute pancreatitis complicating Salmonella enteritis. We report a case of acute pancreatitis complicating Salmonella enteritis. A 43-yr-old woman who was admitted to our department because of Salmonella enteritis developed clinical acute pancreatitis with laboratory and radiographic signs on the fourth hospital day. She was free from symptoms on the eighth hospital day, but her elevated serum amylase and lipase levels persisted for more than 2 m.o. In this case, clinical acute pancreatitis was a complication of bacterial enteritis caused by Salmonella enteritidis, and it was characterized by onset a few days after the onset of enteritis and by sustained elevation of serum pancreatic enzyme levels.
