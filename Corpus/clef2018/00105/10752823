Serum amyloid A versus C-reactive protein in acute pancreatitis: clinical value of an alternative acute-phase reactant. The acute-phase reactant C-reactive protein (CRP) is currently the serum variable of choice for an early, accurate, and cost-effective severity assessment of acute pancreatitis in the daily clinical routine. Serum amyloid A (SAA) proteins comprise a family of apolipoproteins that constitute another major acute-phase reactant and thus could be a potential alternative to CRP assessment. In the present study we investigated the clinical usefulness of SAA determinations in acute pancreatitis using an automated immunoassay technique.Cohort study, comparing patients with complicated and mild acute pancreatitis control groups included individuals with further abdominal disorders and healthy volunteers.A collaborative study between the department of general surgery and the routine laboratory of the department of clinical chemistry/pathobiochemistry.We enrolled 66 patients with acute pancreatitis in the present study. Control groups consisted of healthy subjects (n = 30), patients with chronic pancreatitis (n = 20), patients with pancreatic carcinoma (n = 20), and patients with acute appendicitis (n = 20).Blood samples were collected during 14 consecutive days in patients with acute pancreatitis. A single blood specimen was taken in all control groups after the diagnosis was established.SAA concentrations were 3 mg/L (median range, 3-93) in healthy subjects. Although SAA and CRP both reached their maximum within 4 days after onset of symptoms in patients with acute pancreatitis, SAA concentrations rose faster above normal ranges and reached 676 mg/L (medianSAA is a nonspecific and rapidly produced variable in inflammatory abdominal disorders with a wider dynamic range than CRP. The current assay technique renders SAA an applicable and readily available variable under clinical routine conditions. In cases of acute pancreatitis, however, CRP is still superior to SAA for early and accurate stratification of patients with a complicated course.
