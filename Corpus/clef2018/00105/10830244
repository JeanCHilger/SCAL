CMV allograft pancreatitis: diagnosis, treatment, and histological features. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a common problem in solid organ transplant recipients. CMV infection of pancreas allografts is not, however, well described.We report the clinical presentation, histologic findings, treatment, and outcome in four patients with CMV allograft pancreatitis. These patients presented 18 weeks to 44 months after transplantation with elevated serum amylase and lipase and were suspected to have acute rejection. Percutaneous pancreas allograft biopsy specimens showed evidence of tissue invasive CMV infection. One patient had simultaneous CMV infection and acute rejection.Prolonged treatment with ganciclovir resulted in clinical and histologic resolution of the CMV disease. Rejection was successfully treated. Primary CMV infection in seronegative recipients seemed to be a risk factor. Three patients maintain normal allograft function one patient lost function due to chronic rejection. The histology of tissue-invasive CMV pancreas allograft infection and its differentiation from acute rejection is described.Prompt diagnosis and prolonged therapy with antiviral agents can result in maintenance of allograft function.
