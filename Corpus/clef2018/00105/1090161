Syndrome and pancreatic disease, subcutaneous fat necrosis and polyserositis. Case report and review of literature. Immunologic evaluation of a patient with pancreatitis, subcutaneous fat necrosis, pleuritis, pericarditis and synovitis is presented. The previously recognized syndrome of pancreatic disease, subcutaneous fat necrosis and arthritis is reviewed. Based on analysis of all the cases described in the English language literature it is suggested that this syndrome be expanded to include polyserositis rather than arthritis alone. Although experimental and clinical evidence tends to implicate physiocochemical tissue injury by pancreatic lipase as the primary pathogenic mechanism in this syndrome, studies in our patient suggest the possible contribution of immune-mediated injury. Supporting data include eosinophilia, biopsy demonstration of vasculitis antedating the subcutaneous fat necrosis, immunofluorescent identification of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and C3 in the pleura, and reduced levels of total hemolytic complement in the serum, and pleural and pericardial effusions.
