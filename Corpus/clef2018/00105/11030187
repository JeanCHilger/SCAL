Incidence of post-endoscopic retrograde-cholangiopancreatography/sphincterotomy pancreatitis depends upon definition criteria. The reported incidence of post-endoscopic retrograde-cholangiopancreatography/sphincterotomy pancreatitis ranges between 1.3% and 12.8%. This may likely reflect different definitions of pancreatitis and methods of data collection, rather than differences in patient populations, indications and endoscopic expertise.The present study evaluated the incidence of post-endoscopic retrograde-cholangiopancreatography/sphincterotomy pancreatitis using different definition criteria and different data collection methods.The 24-hour clinical and enzymatic course of 1185 procedures was recorded.Pancreatic-like pain and hyperamylasaemia were evaluated either 6 to 8 hours or 24 hours after the procedure computed tomography scan was performed in those patients with 24-hour pancreatic pain associated with hyperamylasaemia more than three times the upper normal limit. Results. Computed tomography scan findings consistent with pancreatitis were observed in 1.9% of cases, only among those patients with 24-hour pancreatic-like pain and hyperamylasaemia over five times the upper normal limit. The 6-8-hour and 24-hour pancreatic-like pain was associated with serum amylase levels at least three times higher in 11.7% and 6.6% and five times higher or more in 7.4% and 5.1%, respectivelyThe incidence of post-procedure pancreatitis ranged from 1.9% to 11.7% depending on the definition criteria adopted.
