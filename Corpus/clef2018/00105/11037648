Hyperamylasemia associated with endometroid carcinoma of the ovary. Hyperamylasemia and alternations of serum isoamylases have been recorded in lung tumors, tubal disorders such as acute salpingitis and ruptured ectopic pregnancies and a variety of ovarian tumors, and they have been suggested as potential tumor markers. Hyperamylasemia was noted in a patient with a stage IIIC endometroid adenocarcinoma of the ovary. Serum levels of amylase decreased rapidly after removal of the ovarian tumor. In patients presenting with acute abdominal pain and elevated amylase levels, ovarian cancer should be considered in addition to acute pancreatitis.
