Exocrine pancreas: evidence for topographic partition of secretory function. The pattern of amylase, lipase, and chymotrpsinogen content found in pancreatic exocrine tissue surrounding the islets of Langerhans (periinsular halos) differs from that of the rest, or teleinsular part, of the pancreas. Such a topographic partition of secretory function may play a role in the regulation of pancreatic juice composition.
