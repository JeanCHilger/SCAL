From gene to disease hereditary pancreatitis. Hereditary pancreatitis is an autosomal dominant form of chronic pancreatitis. It presents with recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis, usually starting in early childhood. The attacks may vary from mild abdominal pain to pancreatic necrosis, splenic vein thrombosis, pseudocysts and death. Ultimately chronic pancreatitis ensues with unrelenting pain, calcifications, endocrine and exocrine dysfunction. The penetrance is estimated at 80%. With the use of genetic linkage analysis the gene for hereditary pancreatitis was placed on the long arm of chromosome 7 (7q35). Mutational analysis identified cationic trypsinogen as the disease gene. Cationic trypsinogen mutations are thought to result in resistance of this molecule to autolysis.
