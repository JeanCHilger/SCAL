Time course profile of serum trypsinogen-2 and trypsin-2-alpha1-antitrypsin in patients with acute pancreatitis. Trypsinogen-2 and the trypsin-2-alpha1-antitrypsin complex are recently introduced new laboratory markers for acute pancreatitis. They show high sensitivity and specificity for acute pancreatitis on admission, but little is known on their time course profiles.The serum concentrations of trypsinogen-2 and trypsin-2-alpha1-antitrypsin were monitored in 92 patients with verified acute pancreatitis. The follow-up period was 42 days in patients with severe acute pancreatitis (N = 73) and 9 days in mild disease (N = 19).On admission the mean serum concentration of trypsinogen-2 was 2880 microg/l in severe and 920 microg/l in mild acute pancreatitis. These values were 32- and 10-fold the upper reference limit, respectively. Trypsin-2-alpha1-antitrypsin concentrations were 1250 microg/l (100-fold the upper reference limit) and 635 microg/l (52-fold), respectively. The differences were statistically significant (P = 0.026-0.001). The concentrations of trypsinogen-2 and trypsin-2-alpha1-antitrypsin decreased gradually during the follow-up period, but they remained elevated for the entire study period in patients with severe and mild disease.The time course profile of trypsinogen-2 and trypsin-2-alpha1-antitrypsin is favorable for diagnosing acute pancreatitis. The elevation starts within hours after the onset of the disease and it is very steep. Both markers remain elevated longer than amylase and the magnitude of the elevation correlates with the severity of the disease. This is further evidence to support the use of trypsinogen-2 and trypsin-2-alpha1-antitrypsin for the evaluation of patients suspected of having acute pancreatitis.
