Fasting exacerbates acute pancreatitis by occlusion of the common bile duct in rats. We examined the effects of fasting and non-fasting on gallstone-related acute pancreatitis by the occlusion of the common bile duct (OCD). We prepared a rat OCD-induced pancreatitis model under both fasting and non-fasting conditions, and we measured amylase activity in ascites as well as production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. We also examined the pathology of the pancreas, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in some tissues and mortality rates. In the fasted OCD group, ascites containing a large amount of amylase, interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 (CINC-1) as well as marked hemorrhage and necrosis of the pancreatic acinar cells were observed. Pulmonary MPO activity increased 3.4-fold compared to the control group. In the non-fasted OCD group, there was no development of ascites. Slight necrosis of acinar cells and slight increases in pulmonary MPO activity were observed. In addition, in the fasted OCD group, the cumulative mortality rate was 50% 6 days after ligation. However, in the non-fasted OCD group, none of the animals died. These results suggest that gallstone-related severe pancreatitis depends on fasting-related structural and/or functional changes in the pancreas. Moreover, increased production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in ascites under fasting condition may be involved in multiple organ failure resulting from severe acute pancreatitis.
