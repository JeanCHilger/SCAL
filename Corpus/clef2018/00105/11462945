Analysis of postoperative pancreatitis in DSRS with SPD. Distal splenorenal shunt with splenopancreatic disconnection (DSRS + SPD) evolved to prevent the development of a pancreatic siphon, to improve maintenance as well as quality of portal perfusion and to achieve better long-term survival. We report several cases of postoperative pancreatitis in DSRS + SPD. Recently, oxygen-derived free radicals have been reported to play an important role in pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis.In this study, ten cases of DSRS + SPD were examined intraoperatively. The local changes in oxygen-derived free radicals were obtained by measuring lipid peroxide and an endogenous scavenger (SOD) in the development of DSRS + SPD-induced pancreatitis.Lipid peroxide activity as the offense system was not changed before or after SPD. However, SOD activity as a defense system was significantly lowered after SPD compared to before SPD.These results indicate that an imbalance of both systems might be the cause of postoperative pancreatitis.
