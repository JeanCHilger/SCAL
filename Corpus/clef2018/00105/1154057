Endoscopic retrograde choledochopancreatography. Endoscopic retrograde choledochopancreatography (ERCP) was attempted in 77 patients. Of 33 patients suspected of having bilitary tract disease, ductograms were obtained in 21. Of 56 patients suspected of having pancreatic disease, ductograms were obtained in 35. Since 12 patients were thought to have disease of both ductal systems, the total number of suspected ducts exceeds the number of patients. It is concluded that ERCP is a valuable diagnostic tool in the evaluation of pancreatic or biliary tract disease. Additional data from a prospective study are necessary to determine its clinical relevance.
