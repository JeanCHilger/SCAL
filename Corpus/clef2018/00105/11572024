Hyperamylasemia and subclinical pancreatitis after cardiac surgery. Hyperamylasemia after cardiac surgery is common but typically causes no clinical concern because it consists mainly of the salivary isoenzyme. In this study we evaluated the incidence, source, and time course of postoperative hyperamylasemia with special attention to the possibility of subclinical pancreatitis. In 88 patients prospectively tested for serum amylase and lipase concentrations, elastase 1 activity, and amylase isoenzyme characteristics, 57 (64%) showed hyperamylasemia during the early postoperative period. In most cases early hyperamylasemia was not of pancreatic origin, but two patients were diagnosed with subclinical pancreatitis. Among the last 23 patients, 5 of 10 patients with early hyperamylasemia exceeding 1000 IU/L showed late hyperamylasemia on the seventh postoperative day, when it represented mainly the pancreatic isoenzyme. Lipase concentrations and elastase 1 activities were elevated in these cases. Late hyperamylasemia following cardiac surgery may be of pancreatic origin and indicative of subclinical pancreatitis, even if early hyperamylasemia was of salivary origin.
