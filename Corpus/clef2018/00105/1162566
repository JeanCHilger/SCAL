Pancreatitis of unusual origin. The anatomic pattern seen in the three patients with contiguous gastric duplications associated with pancreatic ducts evidently predisposes the patient to pancreatitis. In the previous patient reported upon from this institution, the correlation of severe bleeding episodes with attacks of pancreatitis strongly supports the concept of blood blocking the pancreatic ductal system, thereby producing pancreatitis. Passage of viscous mucoid secretions from the aberrant gastric mucosa into the pancreatic ductal system also might retard the normal flow of pancreatic juice, producing elevation of the serum amylase level and pain. Overdistention of the gastric duplication also might be considered as a source of pain, but such mechanisms can be considered only speculation at present. Diagnosis is usually made after more than one exploratory laparotomy. Hemorrhage may result, should the gastric duplication contain parietal cells, leading to hemoductal pancreatitis, hematemesis or melena and anemia. At least one in five patients with a gastric duplication possesses another intestinal duplication. Developmental defects commonly are associated with gastric cysts. Almost identical anatomy was present in the patients with contiguous duplications. That two such rare pancreatic disorders were documented in the same institution within two years suggests that this pattern of developmental defect is more common that had previously been expected.
