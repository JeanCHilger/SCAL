Effects of dopexamine on acute necrotising pancreatitis in rats. To examine the effects of dopexamine on pancreatic tissue oxygen tension (PtO2) and the extent of acinar injury in rats with acute necrotising pancreatitisLaboratory study.Medical school, Turkey.68 Sprague Dawley rats.Cardiorespiratory measurements, pancreatic PtO2, effects on activity of serum amylase and concentration trypsinogen activation peptide (TAP). and histological picture.The four study groups (sham + saline, sham + dopexamine, acute pancreatitis and acute pancreatitis + dopexamine) were each divided into two in 9 rats in each, pancreatic biochemistry was studied, and in the remaining 8 in each group serum biochemistry and histology were studied. The groups were comparable with regard to mean arterial pressure, heart rate, arterial blood gases, packed cell volume, and serum amylase activity. The use of dopexamine increased pancreatic PtO2 in the sham + dopexamine group without the important blood pressure changes. The induction of pancreatitis resulted in a significant reduction in pancreatic PtO2 in the pancreatitis groups. The use of dopexamine did not increase pancreatic PtO2. There were no significant differences in plasma TAP concentration and the extent of acinar cell injury in the animals in the pancreatitis groups.Treatment with dopexamine does not improve the pancreatic microcirculation or reduce the extent of acinar cell injury in acute necrotising pancreatitis and is therefore unlikely to be of benefit in patients with pancreatitis.
