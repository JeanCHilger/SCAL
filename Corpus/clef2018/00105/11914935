Catalytic activity of phospholipase A2 in blood plasma and pancreatic tissue perfusion in early experimental acute pancreatitis. To investigate the sequence of changes in the catalytic activity of phospholipase A2 in plasma and pancreatic tissue perfusion and oxygenation in mild and severe acute pancreatitis in pigs.Twenty-four pigs were randomized into the groups of severe acute pancreatitis, mild acute pancreatitis, and controls. The pancreatic duct of eight anesthetized and mechanically ventilated pigs was cannulated, and taurocholic acid was infused into the pancreatic duct to induce severe acute pancreatitis. Eight animals received intraductal saline and developed mild acute pancreatitis. Eight pigs were cannulated only and served as controls.Central hemodynamics, arterial blood gases, and acid-base balance were stable throughout the study period in all three groups. Pancreatic tissue oxygenation decreased in pigs with severe acute pancreatitis and increased in animals with mild acute pancreatitis. The catalytic activity of phospholipase A2 in plasma remained stable, and there was no difference between the groups. Similarly, C-reactive protein values remained within the normal range during the study period in all groups.Plasma phospholipase A2 levels do not react to the changes in pancreatic tissue perfusion in the early phase of mild and severe acute pancreatitis.
