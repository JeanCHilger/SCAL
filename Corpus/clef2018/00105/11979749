Acute pancreatitis following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: prevalence and cause of pancreatic amylasemia. To clarify the frequency and cause of acute pancreatitis following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT), we examined retrospectively 57 patients who underwent hematopoietic SCT in our institute from 1984 to 2000. Twelve (21%) of the patients showed an elevated level of serum pancreatic amylase following SCT. However, only 3 patients were clinically diagnosed as having acute pancreatitis. Among these 12 patients, 11 had undergone allogeneic transplantation. Furthermore, patients who had undergone unrelated transplantation (7/16 44%) tended to show a higher incidence of increased amylase than those who had undergone related transplantation (4/24
