The effect of steroid pulse therapy on the development of acute pancreatitis induced by closed duodenal loop in rats. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of a high dose of methylprednisolone (MP) on the development of acute pancreatitis (AP) in rats induced by closed duodenal loop (CDL).Pancreas web weight, volume of ascites, hematocrit, serum amylase activity, concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6, organ blood flow in both the pancreas and the kidney, and histological findings of the pancreas were studied 6 h after the induction of AP.The intravenous administration of MP (30 mg/kg body weight) significantly reduced the increase in pancreas web weight, volume of ascites, hematocrit, serum amylase activity, concentrations of IL-1beta and IL-6, histological edema, and necrosis observed in CDL pancreatitis. The administration of MP also apparently improved both the pancreatic and the renal blood flow.The present results suggest that these cytokines influence at least the progression of AP, and that the mechanism by which MP pulse therapy inhibits the development of AP partly involves the inhibition by MP of the release of the cytokines.
