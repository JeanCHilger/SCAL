Early refeeding after endoscopic biliary or pancreatic sphincterotomy: a randomized prospective study. Patients who have undergone endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) are usually left to fast for arbitrary reasons until they are examined on the following day. The aim of this study was to check whether this systematic fasting after ES is actually justified.A blinded randomized prospective study, involving 146 patients, was carried out from January 1999 to September 2001. All patients undergoing biliary and/or pancreatic endoscopic sphincterotomy during this period were randomly allocated to one of two groups: group 1 patients were re-fed 4 hours after ES, and the group 2 patients were only re-fed 24 hours after the procedure. These two groups were comparable for clinical and procedural data except for stenting.Eight patients in group 1 (11 %) and 26 patients in group 2 (37 %) suffered from abdominal pain which resolved with analgesic drug treatment (P = 0.01). Eight patients in the first group(11 %) and five patients in the second group (7 %) had to be given major opiate analgesics (P = 0.56). Refeeding resulted in abdominal pain in five patients in group 1 and 13 in group 2 (P = 0.04). The serum amylase and lipase levels increased significantly after refeeding in group 1, but lipasemia did not increase significantly in group 2. No significant differences in post-ES complications were observed between the two groups. The mean hospital stay was significantly shorter in group 1 : 2.6 days on average, vs. 3.8 days in group 2 (P = 0.03).In the absence of any perforation of the digestive tract or immediate severe acute pancreatitis, early refeeding could be helpful to decrease pain and shorten the hospital stay in patients who have undergone endoscopic sphincterotomy.
