Coil compaction after embolization of the superior mesenteric artery pseudoaneurysm. A 58-year-old man with an abscess of the psoas muscle was returned to our hospital with hematemesis. Two years earlier, he had undergone coil embolization for a superior mesenteric artery (SMA) pseudoaneurysm secondary to pancreatitis. Based on the physical examination, serum amylase level, and abdominal radiographs, a diagnosis of acute exacerbation of pancreatitis and coil compaction of the SMA pseudoaneurysm was made. The patient underwent re-embolization for the coil compaction using interlocking detachable coils. His condition improved gradually, and he was discharged 3 weeks later. To our knowledge, this is the first report of coil compaction of SMA pseudoaneurysm.
