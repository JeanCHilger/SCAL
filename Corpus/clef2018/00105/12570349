Panniculitis associated with pancreatitis in a cocker spaniel. A 13-year-old, male cocker spaniel presented with a history of inappetence, depression and reluctance to stand. The dog had multiple, ulcerated skin lesions which were diagnosed as panniculitis by histopathology. A diagnosis of pancreatitis was made on the basis of markedly elevated serum lipase concentrations, abdominal ultrasonography which showed an abnormal lobulated area of hypoechoic tissue in the body and right lobe of the pancreas, and a fine needle biopsy from this area which revealed large numbers of degenerate neutrophils. After treatment with antibiotics and prednisolone, the dog made a full clinical recovery and was free of clinical signs for four months. The dog was euthanased five months later and postmortem examination revealed chronic, active pancreatitis and a pancreatic adenoma. This is the first report of antemortem diagnosis of pancreatitis and panniculitis in a dog.
