Assessing the severity of canine pancreatitis. The objective of this study was to determine whether laboratory testing currently available is able to provide prognostic information in canine pancreatitis. A prospective study of dogs with naturally occurring pancreatitis was undertaken. Twenty-two cases with histologically confirmed pancreatic inflammation were included in the study. Each dog had routine haematology parameters, serum biochemistry (including lipase and amylase), serum trypsin-like immunoreactivity and trypsinogen activation peptides (TAP) in urine and plasma measured. Twelve of the dogs were classified as having severe disease. These dogs had statistically significant increases in urinary TAP-creatinine ratio (UTCR) measurement, serum lipase, serum phosphate and serum creatinine concentrations. Additionally dogs with severe pancreatitis had significantly decreased urine specific gravity levels. The most sensitive and specific test to assess the severity of pancreatitis was the measurement of UTCR.
