Liver injury during acute pancreatitis: the role of pancreatitis-associated ascitic fluid (PAAF), p38-MAPK, and caspase-3 in inducing hepatocyte apoptosis. We have demonstrated that pancreatitis-associated ascitic fluid contributes to hepatocyte injury during acute pancreatitis a phenomenon independent of ascites' enzymatic content and Kupffer cell-derived cytokines. Our aim is to characterize the mechanisms of pancreatitis-associated ascitic fluid induced hepatocyte death. NIH mice were injected intraperitoneally with pathogen-free pancreatitis-associated ascitic fluid. Twenty-four hours later, serum AST, ALT, LDH, and hepatocyte apoptosis (TUNEL) were measured. Human hepatocytes (CCL-13) were treated with pancreatitis-associated ascitic fluid +/-SB203580 or caspase-3 inhibitor-II. Mitochondrial membrane integrity was determined by DiOC6 staining. Apoptosis was measured by TUNEL staining and flow cytometry after dual labeling with Annexin-V/7-AAD. Data are mean +/- SEM of triplicates. Pancreatitis-associated ascitic fluid increased serum AST, ALT, LDH, and apoptotic cells in the mouse liver (all P < 0.03 vs. sham). In CCL-13 cells, pancreatitis-associated ascitic fluid induced a time and dose-dependent increase in apoptosis, in addition to p38-MAPK phosphorylation (P = 0.02 vs. control), caspase-3 cleavage (P < 0.03 vs. control) and decreased DiOC6 mitochondrial staining (P < 0.01 vs. control). Both caspase-3 inhibitor-II and SB203580 decreased apoptosis, but the former had no effect on DiOC6 staining. Pancreatitis-associated ascitic fluid induces liver injury and hepatocyte apoptosis by activating p38-MAPK and caspase-3 dependent pro-apoptotic pathways.
