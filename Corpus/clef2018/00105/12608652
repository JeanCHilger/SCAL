ERCP and acute pancreatitis. Acute biliary pancreatitis (ABP) is a serious complication of biliary stones disease and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The role of ERCP in the management of ABP has been the focus of discussion in recent years. In this report, we evaluated a protocol of emergency Endoscopic retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) (within 24 hours) and early ERCP (within 72 hours). From July 1997 to July 2000, were observed 45 patients (19 man and 26 women) with acute biliary pancreatitis. Mean age of patients was 63.4 years (range 21-87 years). Diagnosis of ABP was based on anamnesis and clinical assessment and was confirmed by specific laboratory data (hyperamylasemia, hyperlipasemia, total and fractionated bilirubinemia, gamma-GT, transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, hypocalcemia, hyperglycemia, leukocytosis). Ultrasound scanning within 24 h of admission was performed in 45 patients (100%) and it revealed gallbladder stones and muddy bile in 39 patients (87%). Computed tomography (CT) performed in all patients, showed a severe acute pancreatitis in the second or subsequent week following admission. The severity of acute pancreatitis was established by Glasgow's criteria and by clinical details of patients. ERCP and Endoscopic Sphinterotomy (ES) was performed in all 45 patients with acute biliary pancreatitis. Twenty-six patients (57%) were classified as having a severe attack (> 4) 19 as having a mild attack by Glasgow's criteria. ERCP associated with ES was performed within 24 hours in 22 patients (49%), 11 (50%) showed a severe attack and 11 (50%) showed a mild attack. A total of 2 complications (4%) occurred and the mortality was of 2 patients (4%). In 23 patients (51%) ERCP and ES was performed within 72 hours after conservative therapy, 8 (35%) showed a mild attack and 15 (65%) showed a severe attack. A total of 5 complications (9%) occurred and the mortality was of 3 patients (6%). Our study showed that ERCP with endoscopic sphincterotomy can be performed safely by skilled endoscopist, without adverse consequences soon after the onset of acute biliary pancreatitis even within the first 24 hours and it showed that is better than ERCP within 72 hours after conservative therapy.
