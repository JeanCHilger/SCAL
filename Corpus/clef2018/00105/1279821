A double-blinded multicenter trial of somatostatin in the treatment of acute pancreatitis. To evaluate the effect of somatostatin in the treatment of acute pancreatitis, 63 patients were randomly allocated to continuous intravenous infusion for three days of 250 micrograms of somatostatin (Dura Scan, Odense, Denmark) per hour (n = 33), or placebo (n = 30). Patients with a first attack of pancreatitis, serum amylase level of more than 450 units per liter and symptoms for less than 24 hours were eligible for participation in the study. Apart from a slightly significant faster decrease in serum amylase concentrations, we were unable to demonstrate any significant benefit from somatostatin with regard to paraclinical values and clinical course.
