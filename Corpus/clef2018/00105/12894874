Diagnostic value of pancreatic elastase-1 in human acute pancreatitis. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis (AP) is usually confirmed by a significant increase of the serum amylase and/or lipase level. However, serum pancreatic elastase-1 (pEla-1) was found to be a more sensitive diagnostic marker in AP, when assayed by the radioimmunoassay procedure. We analyzed the serum concentration of pEla-1, measured by the ELISA technique in 46 patients with AP and in a control group of 12 healthy volunteers. On admission (day 1) we found significantly higher pEla-1 levels in patients with AP than in the controls. During the following days, the concentration of pEla-1 rapidly decreased to nearly undetectable values on the 3rd day. There was no significant difference between patients with mild and severe AP nor those of different etiology. We suggest that pEla-1 has little diagnostic value and does not provide additional information to that of the less expensive and more widely available serum amylase and lipase.
