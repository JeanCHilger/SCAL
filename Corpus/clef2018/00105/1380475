Can somatostatin prevent injection pancreatitis after ERCP? In a double-blind randomized study, 30 patients received somatostatin infusion during ERCP and 30 patients placebo with the aim of evaluating whether somatostatin can reduce the incidence of injection pancreatitis. S-amylase, U-amylase and S-lipase were evaluated before, during and after (up to 48 hours) ERCP. C-peptide was also determined as a marker of the function of the endocrine pancreas. While no statistically significant effect of somatostatin in terms of amylase and lipase was to be found, somatostatin did significantly decrease c-peptide levels in plasma, indicating that the peptide inhibited beta-cell secretion. About 40% of patients in the somatostatin group and about 50% in the placebo group showed signs of injection pancreatitis (elevated levels of enzymes) and in both groups there are patients with clinically apparent pancreatitis.
