Hypotrypsinemia as a possible factor in the activation of motor function of the duodenum in pancreatic atrophy in rats. The effect of pancreas atrophy on myoelectrical activity of the duodenum and serum trypsin, trypsin inhibitor, amylase, lipase activity has been described. The activation of the duodenum motor activity has been established. The changes in the motor activity were connected with trypsin and trypsin inhibitor activity of serum. The motor activity changes were compensated by trypsin therapy.
