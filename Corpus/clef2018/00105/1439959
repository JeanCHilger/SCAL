Hereditary angioedema associated with pancreatitis. A 44-year-old woman with C1q esterase inhibitor deficiency was seen in consultation for recurrent right upper quadrant abdominal discomfort, nausea, and vomiting. Each of these episodes was accompanied by concomitant peripheral edema. Initial diagnostic efforts were fruitless. In time, intermittent elevations in amylase and lipase developed, and a diagnosis of relapsing pancreatitis was made. We contend that the patient's recurrent acute pancreatitis is associated with her hereditary angioedema. Possible pathogenesis could involve intermittent intrapancreatic edema with partial ductal obstruction or loss of inhibition on the kallikrein-kinin system.
