Expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 between pancreatic microcirculation and peripheral circulation in rats with acute edematous pancreatitis. To study the changes of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) expression on polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) in peripheral circulation and pancreatic microcirculation in rats with acute edematous pancreatitis (AEP).The model of AEP was established with 50 Wistar rats, and the changes of PECAM-1 expression on PMNs from the splenic vein and inferior vena cava were determined by flow cytometry.PECAM-1 expression on PMNs showed no significant difference between pancreatic microcirculation and peripheral circulation at AEP2h and AEP4h time points. From the AEP4h to the AEP8h time point, PECAM-1 expression in peripheral circulation was up-regulated, but PECAM-1 expression in pancreatic microcirculation was down-regulated. PECAM-1 expression had a significant difference between pancreatic microcirculation and peripheral circulation at the AEP8h time point (P<0.05).PECAM-1 expression on PMNs is in a converse way between pancreatic microcirculation and peripheral circulation in AEP.
