Acute pancreatitis: symptoms, diagnosis and management. Pancreatitis is a relatively common condition that affects approximately one per cent of the population. Although the majority of attacks are mild, it is fatal in one in four people who develop it in a severe form. Clinical manifestations are so varied that the condition should be considered in the differential diagnosis of all upper abdominal pain until serum amylase concentrations become normal. Specific treatment is unavailable, therefore therapy is supportive, including the management of complications if and when they develop.
