Fas deficiency exacerbates cerulein-induced pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis results in many deaths each year. Our understanding of pathophysiology is limited. To better understand the impact of apoptosis versus necrosis, we compared cerulein-induced pancreatitis in Fas-deficient (MRL lpr/lpr) versus Fas-sufficient (MRL +/+) mice. Average amylase values in Fas-deficient mice were substantially greater than in Fas-sufficient mouse. Histology graded on edema, inflammation, vacuolization, and necrosis showed greater injury in the Fas-deficient mouse. This finding suggests that the Fas pathway is important in controlling cerulein-induced pancreatitis.
