Endothelial nitric oxide synthase is protective in the initiation of caerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in mice. The effect of inhibiting nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS) or enhancing NO on the course of acute pancreatitis (AP) is controversial, in part because three NOS isoforms exist: neuronal (nNOS), endothelial (eNOS), and inducible (iNOS). We investigated whether inhibition or selective gene deletion of NOS isoforms modified the initiation phase of caerulein-induced AP in mice and explored whether this affected pancreatic microvascular blood flow (PMBF). We investigated the effects of nonspecific NOS inhibition with N(omega)-nitro-l-arginine (l-NNA 10 mg/kg ip) or targeted deletion of eNOS, nNOS, or iNOS genes on the initiation phase of caerulein-induced AP in mice using in vivo and in vitro models. Western blot analysis was performed to assess eNOS phosphorylation status, an indicator of enzyme activity, and microsphere studies were used to measure PMBF. l-NNA and eNOS deletion, but not nNOS or iNOS deletion, increased pancreatic trypsin activity and serum lipase during the initiation phase of in vivo caerulein-induced AP. l-NNA and eNOS did not affect trypsin activity in caerulein-hyperstimulated isolated acini, suggesting that nonacinar events mediate the effect of NOS blockade in vivo. The initiation phase of AP in wild-type mice was associated with eNOS Thr(495) residue dephosphorylation, which accompanies eNOS activation, and a 178% increase in PMBF
