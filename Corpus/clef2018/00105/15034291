Type of electric currents used for standard endoscopic sphincterotomy does not determine the type of complications. The blended current is usually used for endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST) to minimize bleeding. The pure cutting current may induce less edema of the ampulla and therefore result in less injury to the pancreas theoretically. The aim of this study was to evaluate effects of electric currents used on the development of serum pancreatic enzyme evaluation, clinical pancreatitis or bleeding after EST.One hundred and eighteen consecutive patients who underwent EST with standard papillotome alone for the treatment of choledocholithiasis were reviewed. All EST had been performed by two endoscopists whose experience on EST was similar: one uses 'blended current' (BC group, n=74), while the other uses 'pure cutting current' (PC group, n=44).Baseline clinical, laboratory, and procedural parameters were similar in both groups. The incidences of hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia were similar between two groups. There was no significant difference in the incidence of clinical pancreatitis between two groups (BC 6.8% vs PC 0.0%, p=0.1557). All episodes of pancreatitis were mild. No episodes of significant bleeding occurred after EST. The incidences of sepsis, cholangitis and perforation were also not different between two groups.Development of complications after standard EST such as hyperamylasemia, clinical pancreatitis, and bleeding may not depend on the electric current used.
