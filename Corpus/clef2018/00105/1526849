Etiology and pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis. The pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis is based on the following principles: 1. Biliary. In biliary pancreatitis there is a causal relationship between the induction of acute pancreatitis and the migration of gallstones. The basic pathomechanism seems to be a combination of an increase in permeability and pressure in the ductal system. 2. Intraacinar. Caerulein-pancreatitis is a well established experimental model which reflects the intracellular/interstitial type of activation. Basolateral secretion of pancreatic enzymes into the interstitial space represents the initial event. Intracellular activation of trypsin by the fusion of zymogen-granules and lysosomes has been advocated as an alternative mechanism. 3. Alcohol. The acute alcohol pancreatitis comprises a combined pathogenesis. Obstruction and reflux as well as the cytotoxic effect of alcohol seem to be the main principles. 4. Disturbance of pancreatic microcirculation. Ischemia of the pancreas seems to play a key role in the transition from pancreatic edema to necrosis. Improvement of capillary perfusion by isovolemic hemodilution with dextran 60 has been shown to be an efficient therapeutic tool.
