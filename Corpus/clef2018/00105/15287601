New tools for laparoscopic division of the pancreas: a comparative animal study. We tested the hypothesis that the pancreas can be safely divided laparoscopically using non-suture devices. Twelve pigs were randomized into 4 groups: 1) laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (LDP) using an ultrasonic scalpel 2) LDP using an ultrasonic scalpel with pancreatic stump suture reinforcement
