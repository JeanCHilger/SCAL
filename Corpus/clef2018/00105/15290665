Prophylaxis of ERCP-related pancreatitis: a randomized, controlled trial of somatostatin and gabexate mesylate. It still is debated whether post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis can be prevented by administering either somatostatin or gabexate mesylate. The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy of a 6.5-hour infusion of somatostatin or gabexate mesylate in preventing ERCP-related complications.In a double-blind multicenter trial, 1127 patients undergoing ERCP were randomly assigned to intravenous administration of somatostatin (750 microg n = 351), gabexate mesylate (500 mgNo significant differences in incidences of pancreatitis, hyperamylasemia, or abdominal pain were observed among the placebo (4.8%, 32.6%, and 5.3%, respectively), somatostatin (6.3%, 26.8%, and 5.1%, respectively), and gabexate mesylate groups (5.8%, 31.5%, and 6.3%, respectively). Univariate analysis of patient characteristics and endoscopic maneuvers showed that a Freeman score >1 (P < 0.0001), >/=3 pancreatic injections (P < 0.00001), and precut sphincterotomy (P = 0.01) were significantly associated with post-ERCP pancreatitis. At multiple logistic regression analysis, >/=3 pancreatic injections (odds ratio [OR], 1.95 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.45-2.63) and a Freeman score >1 (OR, 1.47Long-term (6.5-hr) administration of either somatostatin or gabexate mesylate is ineffective for the prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis. Pancreatic injury seems to be related to difficulty in common bile duct access.
