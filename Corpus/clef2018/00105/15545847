Plasmapheresis as an adjuvant therapy for hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis. Hypertriglyceridemia is an uncommon cause of pancreatitis. A serum triglyceride level of more then 1000 to 2000 mg/dL is an identifiable risk factor. Interestingly, serum pancreatic enzyme levels may be normal or only minimally elevated in such cases. The reduction of triglyceride level to below 1000 mg/dL effectively prevents further episodes of pancreatitis. The mainstay of treatment for the hypertriglyceridemia associated with pancreatitis includes dietary restriction of fat and administration of lipid-lowering agents. It is thought that within 24 to 48 hours of the onset of pancreatitis, in the majority of patients, triglyceride levels fall rapidly as a result of fasting status, as the absorption of chylomicrons to the blood is cut off. Experiences with plasmapheresis are limited. We report a case of hypertriglyceridemic necrotizing pancreatitis with mildly elevated amylase and lipase, treated successfully with plasmapheresis.
