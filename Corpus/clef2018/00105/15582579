Pivotal participation of nitrogen dioxide in L-arginine induced acute necrotizing pancreatitis: protective role of superoxide scavenger 4-OH-TEMPO. For the first time, a direct sensitive method of *NO(2) detection and measurement in biological material has been established. It is based on the interaction of this radical with the coordination compound of Cr(III) with aminodeoxysugar as biosensor. Our new method makes it possible to precisely assess *NO(2) level in experimental acute necrotizing pancreatitis induced by L-arginine, where oxidative and nitrosative stresses are supposed to play a key role in the pathomechanism of the disease. As much as 20 nmol of *NO(2)/mg protein was detected which correlated with severe deterioration of pancreatic acinar cell ultrastructure. Protective effect of superoxide radical scavenger 4-OH-TEMPO expressed as *NO(2) level decrease confirmed by preserved acinar cell ultrastructure and decreased pancreatic amylase release to blood serum is demonstrated. This study reveals a possible pathomechanism of L-arginine induced acute pancreatitis.
