Effects of moderate hypothermia on pancreatic injury and survival in rats with acute hemorrhagic necrotizing pancreatitis. To investigate the effect of moderate hypothermia on pancreatic injury and survival of rats with acute hemorrhagic necrotizing pancreatitis (AHNP).A set of 112 rats were randomly divided into three equal groups: (1)sham-operated rats (n=24) which were kept at 37.0-37.5 centigrade after laparotomy (2)AHNP rats (n=44) treated with normothermia (37.0-37.5 centigrade)Serum amylase and lipase levels, vascular permeability index were significantly reduced at 2 or 5 hours, and pancreatic edema significantly reduced at 5 hours after pancreatitis induction in hypothermic group compared with normothermic group (all P<0.05). Mean survival time, which was 7.5 hours (3.0-18.0 hours) in normothermic group, was prolonged with hypothermia to 25.5 hour (13.0-72.0 hours). The survival of hypothermic animals was higher than normothermic ones after pancreatitis induction ( P=0.000 1).Moderate hypothermia applied after pancreatitis induction can provide protection against pancreatic injury, and increase survival in rats with AHNP. While the mechanism underlying this protection remains to be clarified, the findings of present study have implications for the possibility that hypothermia may be helpful as an adjunctive clinical therapy in acute pancreatitis.
