Clinical implications of genetic risk factors of chronic pancreatitis. The identification of a specific mutation in the human cationic trypsinogen gene in large kindreds with hereditary pancreatitis was the key to understand the genetic background of chronic pancreatitis. Rapidly, other variants within the same gene were identified-even in small families with a minority of patients. Later, mutations of the most important intrapancreatic trypsin inhibitor SPINK1 were found with high prevalence in patients with idiopathic, tropical and alcoholic chronic pancreatitis. We summarize interesting genetic and biochemical findings, point to clinical features and review recommendations for genetic analysis, follow-up and cancer prevention.
