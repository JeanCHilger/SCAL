Pancreatitis accompanying inflammatory bowel diseases, and our observations. According to the literature data the modern concepts of the etiological factors, the pathomorphological features, the diagnosis, the clinical features and the treatment of the drug-induced and the idiopathic pancreatitis, accompanying the IBD are reviewed. The results of a retrospective review of the clinical data of 50 patients, operated on--16 with Crohn's disease and 34 with ulcerative colitis, are shown. Postoperative hyperamylasemia was found in 2 patients with Crohn's disease and in 3 patients with ulcerative colitis. One of them also had primary sclerosing cholangitis. All patients were treated with Metronidazole and Cortizone. Nine years after the operation one of the patients with ulcerative colitis had acute pancreatitis, treated conservatively.
