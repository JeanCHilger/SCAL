The effect of interleukin-10 on acute pancreatitis induced by cerulein in a rat experimental model. To investigate whether interleukin-10, a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine, could have a therapeutic effect on rats on that were made pancreatitis by cerulein. Thirty Wistar Albino rats were randomized into sham, pancreatitis, and therapy groups (n = 10 in each). Nothing was applied to the sham group pancreatitis by inject-ing cerulein (50 micro/g/kg/h) was induced in the pancreatitis and therapy groups. Interleukin-10 (10.000 U) was injected at 1 and 4 h after pancreatitis inductions in the therapy group. The rats were sacrificed at postoperative hour 24. The following parameters were investigated: the leukocyte count, blood glucose, amylase, lipase and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels in the blood samples
