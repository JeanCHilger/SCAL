Acute pancreatitis associated with varicella-zoster virus infection in a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. A patient with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) who developed acute pancreatitis (AP) during the course of a disseminated herpes zoster is presented. Diagnosis was based on the simultaneity of abdominal pain with hyperamylasemia, the dissemination of the cutaneous lesions and the positive varicella-zoster virus serology at titres 1/640. Response to acyclovir treatment was spectacular. To our knowledge this is the second case of AP produced by the varicella-zoster virus and the first described in the course of disseminated herpes zoster. We believe that the varicella-zoster virus should be included within the causes of AP in patients with the human immunodeficiency virus.
