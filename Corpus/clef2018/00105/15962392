Application of endoscopic sphincterotomy in acute pancreatitis with fluid collection: a prospective study. To elucidate the role of endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST) in the treatment of acute pancreatitis.Ninety patients with acute pancreatitis were randomly divided into two groups: EST group and control group. All the patients underwent pancreatitis routine therapy, additionally the EST group was treated with EST and endoscopic naso-bile drainage (ENBD). The time of disappearance of abdominal symptoms and signs, normalization of amylase, hospitalization and absorption of acute fluid was recorded for all patients.The time of disappearance of abdominal pain, normalization of blood and urine amylase and hospitalization was significantly shorter in EST group than in control group. The ratios of disappearance of fluid in mild acute pancreatitis patients was significantly higher in EST group (51.52%, 84.85%, 90.91%, 93.94%) than in the control group (0%, 30.30%, 69.70%, 72.73%, P<0.01 or P<0.05). When the ratios of reduction of fluid in severe acute pancreatitis patients of the EST group were compared (8.33%, 58.33%, 83.33%, 91.67%) with those in the control group (0%, 8.33%, 25% and 41.67%), there were significant differences.The effect of EST+ENBD on acute pancreatitis with fluid is rather good.
