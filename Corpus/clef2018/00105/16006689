Acute pancreatitis in adult as a cause of haemolytic uraemic syndrome is very rare.A 19-year-old male presented with symptom and signs suggestive of acute pancreatitis which was confirmed as his serum amylase was significantly raised. Within three days of admission he developed acute renal failure with evidence of haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia. A clinical diagnosis of haemolytic uraemic syndrome was made and he was treated with plasma exchange. He made a complete recovery.Renal failure in a patient with acute pancreatitis is rarely due to haemolytic uraemic syndrome.
