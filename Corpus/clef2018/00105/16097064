Alpha-lipoic acid protects against cholecystokinin-induced acute pancreatitis in rats. Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) has been used as an antioxidant. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of alpha-lipoic acid on cholecystokinin (CCK)-octapeptide induced acute pancreatitis in rats.ALA at 1 mg/kg was intra-peritoneally injected, followed by 75 microg/kg CCK-octapeptide injected thrice subcutaneously after 1, 3, and 5 h. This whole procedure was repeated for 5 d. We checked the pancreatic weight/body weight ratio, the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the levels of lipase, amylase of serum. Repeated CCK octapeptide treatment resulted in typical laboratory and morphological changes of experimentally induced pancreatitis.ALA significantly decreased the pancreatic weight/body weight ratio and serum amylase and lipase in CCK octapeptide-induced acute pancreatitis. However, the secretion of IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha were comparable in CCK octapeptide-induced acute pancreatitis.ALA may have a protective effect against CCK octapeptide-induced acute pancreatitis.
