Exacerbation of acute pancreatitis by combined cholinergic stimulation and duct obstruction. The role of cholinergic pathways in the pathogenesis of bile-pancreatic duct ligation (BPDL)-induced acute pancreatitis in rats remains controversial. We hypothesized that cholinergic stimulation exacerbates acute pancreatic inflammation in the presence of duct obstruction.We studied 34 rats divided into 5 groups as follows: (1) sham operation (2) BPDLThe P value was less than .05 by analysis of variance. Pancreatic morphologic changes and zymogen fraction hyperamylasemia seen with duct ligation (2 vs. 1) were ameliorated significantly by duodenal BPJ replacement (3 vs. 2), but not when exogenous CCh was administered (4 vs. 3), whereas CCh alone showed no significant changes compared with sham (5 vs. 1).Cholinergic stimulation and duct obstruction synergistically amplify acinar hyperstimulation and exacerbate acute pancreatitis.
