Hydatid acute pancreatitis. Hydatid acute pancreatitis is a rare condition, mostly reported as case presentations.A series of eight patients with hydatid acute pancreatitis, referred between January 1990 and January 2003, are reported. All patients presented acute pancreatitis confirmed with clinical presentation, radiologic examination and laboratory findings. All patients had elevated levels of blood amylase value (more than 500 U/L). Five patients (62%) had high bilirubin levels (2.1 to 3.4 mg/dl) during the initial hospitalization. Computed tomography findings revealed acute pancreatitis in four patients two had associated pseudocyst formation.Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed on all patients and revealed hydatid cystic material in the common bile duct secondary to cystobiliary rupture in all patients. All patients underwent endoscopic sphincterotomy that was performed after dilatation with extractor balloon, and hydatid material was removed in all. Six patients were operated on after the initial episode subsided. Drainage of the cyst, appropriate cavity management and T-tube drainage of the common bile duct was employed in all patients to control bile leakage after the operation. Scolices and hydatid membrane were detected during common bile duct exploration in all patients due to presentation of cystobiliary rupture. There was no mortality. Postoperative pulmonary infection and wound infection were encountered in one patient each. During two to 13 years' follow-up, one patient developed recurrent hydatid disease. Recurrent pancreatitis did not occur.Hydatid acute pancreatitis is a rare condition. However, it should be remembered in patients with abdominal pain, especially in endemic areas.
