Effects of pancreatic duct ligation on pancreatic response to bombesin. To examine mechanisms that might be related to biliary pancreatitis, we examined the effects of pancreatic duct ligation (PDL) with pancreatic stimulation in vivo. PDL alone caused no increase in pancreatic levels of trypsinogen activation peptide (TAP), trypsin, or chymotrypsin and did not initiate pancreatitis. Although bombesin caused zymogen activation within the pancreas, the increases were slight and it did not cause pancreatitis. However, the combination of PDL with bombesin resulted in prominent increases in pancreatic TAP, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and the appearance of TAP in acinar cells and caused pancreatitis. Disruption of the apical actin network in the acinar cell was observed when PDL was combined with bombesin but not with PDL or bombesin alone. These studies suggest that when PDL is combined with pancreatic acinar cell stimulation, it can promote zymogen activation, the retention of active enzymes in acinar cells, and the development of acute pancreatitis.
