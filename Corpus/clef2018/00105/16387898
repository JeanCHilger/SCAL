I.v. hypertonic glucose stimulates the exocrine pancreas in rat. Pancreatic atrophy and dysfunction resulting from parenteral nutrition (PN) may be explained by several mechanisms one of the important factors is the nutrient in the circulation, which affects the pancreatic growth and secretion. The effect of nutrients on the pancreatic exocrine still has controversies. The aim of the present study is to better understand the effect of i.v. glucose on the exocrine pancreas stimulated by cholecystokinin during the parenterally fed condition.Two mixed solutions consisting of 30% and 50% glucose, respectively, were used. Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 5 groups, including a control group a freely fed group received cholecystokininThe body weight in all groups was increased but lower than in the freely fed rats. I.v. glucose caused a decrease in the pancreatic weight, the amount of the pancreatic protein and DNA, and the level of amylase but elevated the level of trypsin in all treated groups. The enzymes were elevated after infusion of cholecystokinin with glucose, but they were lower than in freely fed animals with cholecystokinin. Compared with 30% glucose, 50% glucose elevated the level of amylase but did not affect the level of trypsin.I.v. glucose results in atrophy of the exocrine pancreas, elevates the amylase in pancreas, but suppresses the stimulatory effect of cholecystokinin on the exocrine pancreas.
