Beneficial effect of resveratrol on cholecystokinin-induced experimental pancreatitis. Resveratrol is a phytoalexin with strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects reaching high concentrations in red wine. The aim of our study was to test the effects of resveratrol pretreatment on cholecystokinin-octapeptide (CCK-8)-induced acute pancreatitis in rats. Animals were divided into a control group, a group treated with CCK-8 and a group receiving 10 mg/kg resveratrol prior to CCK-8 administration. Resveratrol ameliorated the CCK-8-induced changes in the laboratory parameters, and reduced the histological damage in the pancreas. The drug failed to improve the pancreatic antioxidant state, but increased the amount of hepatic reduced glutathione and prevented the reduction of hepatic catalase activity. Resveratrol-induced inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation or reduction of the pancreatic tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) concentration could not be demonstrated. In conclusion, the beneficial effects of resveratrol on acute pancreatitis seem to be mediated by the antioxidant effect of resveratrol or by an NF-kappaB-independent anti-inflammatory mechanism.
