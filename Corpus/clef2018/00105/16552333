Ciclosporin aggravates tissue damage in ischemia reperfusion-induced acute pancreatitis. Ischemia reperfusion (I/R)-associated early graft pancreatitis is a major complication after pancreas transplantation. The influence of immunosuppressants on graft pancreatitis remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate ciclosporin and tacrolimus in experimental pancreatic I/R.Moderate pancreatitis was induced in rats by I/R injury. Animals were assigned to 4 groups: (1) control without I/R, (2) I/R without therapy, (3) I/R + ciclosporin, or (4) I/R + tacrolimus. After 24 hours, pancreatic damage was evaluated by amylase, endothelin 1, thromboxane A2, and histology. Additionally, microcirculation was evaluated 12 hours after reperfusion by intravital microscopy.I/R significantly increased amylase compared with controls, with maximum levels after ciclosporin treatment. Histology showed comparable tissue injury in control and tacrolimus-treated animals. Ciclosporin-treated animals developed significantly (P < 0.05) more inflammation and necrosis compared with the other groups. Erythrocyte velocity evaluated by intravital microscopy was reduced in all animals after I/R. This was significantly pronounced after ciclosporin application. There was a significant increase of adherent leukocytes and platelets in ciclosporin-treated animals compared with both other groups.Tacrolimus does not negatively influence I/R-induced pancreatitis, whereas ciclosporin aggravates pancreatic tissue damage after I/R. These effects should be evaluated in the clinical setting of pancreas transplantation.
