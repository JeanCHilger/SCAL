Clinical significance of serum thioredoxin 1 levels in patients with acute pancreatitis. Thioredoxin 1 (TRX-1), a redox-regulating protein with antioxidant activity, is induced by oxidative stress, and serum TRX-1 levels are recognized as an oxidative-stress marker. The aim of this study was to clarify the clinical significance of serum TRX-1 levels in patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) and evaluate the usefulness of this measurement in assessing disease severity.Serum TRX-1 levels were determined on admission in 18 patients with severe AP and 36 patients with mild AP. We also investigated the relationship between serum TRX-1 levels and clinical and laboratory data.The median serum TRX-1 levels on admission were 54.9 ng/mL in mild AP and 118.8 ng/mL in severe AP. When the cutoff value for TRX-1 in predicting severe AP was determined to be 100 ng/mL, its sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 83.3%, 94.4%, and 90.7%, respectively. A significant correlation was observed between serum TRX-1 levels and Ranson score (r = 0.674), C-reactive protein (r = 0.718), interleukin 6 (r = 0.712), leukocyte count (r = 0.642), and serum amylase (r = 0.436).Serum TRX-1 levels significantly correlate with AP severity. TRX-1 should constitute a reliable oxidative-stress marker for the evaluation of AP severity in relation to oxidative stress.
