Cholesterol crystals enhance and phospholipids protect against pancreatitis induced by hydrophobic bile salts: a rat model study. The role of bile composition in the pathogenesis of biliary pancreatitis is unknown. The objective of this experiment was to explore the potential role of bile salts, phospholipids, and cholesterol crystals in the pathogenesis of biliary pancreatitis in a rat model.Model systems composed of taurodeoxycholate (TDC), mixed bile salts (MBS), or tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDC) [in 10 mM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4], with or without cholesterol crystals or phosphatidylcholine, were infused into bile ducts of male Sprague-Dawley rats. Twenty-four hours later, animals were killed for histopathologic scoring of (peri)pancreatic inflammation.: Severity of acute pancreatitis depended on bile salt hydrophobicity (TDC > MBS > TUDC = PBS histopathologic scores: 25.6 +/- 0.5, 23.0 +/- 1.5, 14.4 +/- 2.2, 14.8 +/- 1.0, respectivelyIn the rat model, hydrophobic bile salts and cholesterol crystals aggravate biliary pancreatitis, whereas phospholipids have a protective effect.
