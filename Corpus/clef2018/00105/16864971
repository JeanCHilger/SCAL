Influence of selenium treatment on the acute toxicity of dibutyltin dichloride in rats. Dibutyltin dichloride (DBTC) is an organotin compound used as a model for acute pancreatitis. The aim was to determine the effect of various doses of Na-selenite on the pathogenesis and course of DBTC-induced toxic changes in organs and serum of rats.Experimental pancreatitis was induced by intravenous administration of 6 mg kg(-1) BW DBTC. Na-selenite was applied as a single intravenous dose of 5 mg kg(-1) BW and as daily oral dose of 1 mg kg(-1) BW. Malondialdehyde (MDA) was detected to observe the level of oxidative stress. The tin concentration in bile and urine shows the elimination of DBTC. Organ changes were indicated by serum parameters as well as histology.DBTC causes an acute pancreatitis, cholestasis and liver lesions determined by specific elevated serum parameters and several histological lesions. Na-selenite significantly diminished MDA concentration, lipase, bilirubin and transaminases as well as organ injuries compared to only DBTC-treated rats.The treatment with Na-selenite in the scope of DBTC-induced pancreatitis points to a reduced oxidative stress characterized by diminished MDA serum levels and a milder course of pancreatitis. The generation of DBTC-Na-selenite complexes could also be a mechanism to decrease the toxicity of organotin compounds like DBTC.
