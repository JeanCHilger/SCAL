Analysis of CFTR, SPINK1, PRSS1 and AAT mutations in children with acute or chronic pancreatitis. Defects of PRSS1, SPINK1, CFTR and AAT are considered causative or predisposing to pancreatitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of these defects into molecular pathology of chronic pancreatitis (CP) and acute recurrent pancreatitis (ARP).Ninety-two children with CP or ARP, 55 family members and 50 controls were investigated. The subjects were screened for PRSS1 mutations: R122H, R122C, A16V, N29I SPINK1 N34S variantWe identified 1 mutated allele in at least 1 of 4 genes in 31 of 92 patients and 12 of 50 controls (P = 0.157). Mutations in SPINK1 and PRSS1 were most frequent. PRSS1 mutations were identified mainly in CP patients (9.6% of CP vs 2.5% of ARP alleles, P = 0.094), whereas N34S SPINK1 mutation was present with comparable frequency in CP and ARP patients (7.7% vs 10.0%, P = 0.768). The frequency of mutations in CFTR alleles was similar to controls (4.9% vs 5%, P = 0.587). Overall frequency of AAT mutations was lower than in the controls. Family studies showed that defects in the examined genes did not always segregate with disease.PRSS1 defects seem to be causative for pancreatitis, whereas defects in SPINK1 are suggested to be associated with the disease. No association between CFTR mutations and pancreatitis was observed. The importance of AAT variants remains speculative.
