Intracellular mechanism responsible for reduced enzyme secretion from camostate-induced hypertrophied pancreas. Chornic exogenous administration of cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK8) to rats led to a reduced sensitivity of pancreatic acinar cells to both CCK8 and carbachol stimulation without changes in affinity or number of CCK or muscarinic receptors. In addition, repeated feeding of camostate, a synthetic protease inhibitor which stimulates endogenous CCK release, desensitized the response of the acini to caerulein. This study investigates whether an altered postreceptor signal transduction mechanism is responsible for the reduced amylase secretion. Four days of camostate treatment significantly increased pancreatic weight, protein and amylase, but not DNA content, indicating organ hypertrophy, CCK8 and carbachol stimulated amylase release from acini, isolated from camostate-treated rats, was significantly reduced without shifting the dose response curve compared to controls. There was no difference in total phosphoinositide turnover between the groups. In addition, CCK8 and carbachol stimulated 45Ca efflux and calcium ionophore stimulated amylase release were similar in both groups. These results indicate that the release of calcium from intracellular stores and the utilization of intracellular calcium to drive amylase secretion is not affected in the hypertrophied pancreas. In contrast, incubation of acini from camostate-treated rats with TPA (a phorbol ester which directly stimulates protein kinase C) showed a 48% reduction in amylase secretion. This suggests that a regulatory mechanism is present at the level of protein kinase C or beyond, which is responsible for the decrease in amylase release in the hypertrophied pancreas.
