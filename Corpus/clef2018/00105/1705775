Glucocorticoids effects on exocrine pancreatic secretion in caerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in the rat. The present work reports on exocrine pancreatic secretion in control rats, adrenalectomized rats and hydrocortisone-treated (10 mg/Kg/d) rats during 7 days, under normal conditions and after induction of acute pancreatitis with caerulein (20 micrograms/Kg) by 4 subcutaneous injections at hourly intervals. Pancreatic secretion was seen to be affected by the procedure of adrenalectomy, which led to a marked reduction in the secretion of proteins and amylase with respect to control values. This was probably due to the decrease occurring in the zymogen granules in the acinar cells of the exocrine pancreas, a phenomenon which also led to a decrease in pancreatic weight observed in these animals. Treatment with hydrocortisone induced a decrease in the secretion of proteins and amylase, as well as an increase in pancreatic weight. This agrees with the accepted hypothesis that large amounts glucocorticoids stimulate the synthesis and storage of proteins in the exocrine pancreas, reducing the secretory phase. The administration of high doses of caerulein under these conditions led to acute pancreatitis in the three groups of animals. This was paralleled by a dramatic decrease in protein and amylase secretion and by severe interstitial edema of the pancreas and by increases in serum amylase values. In the case of the animals treated previously with hydrocortisone, the latter were tripled with respect to the control animals. The conclusion is offered that since the storage of enzyme proteins is governed by glucocorticoids, which furthermore increase the sensitivity of the acinar cells to stimulation by secretagogues, the administration of these substances during the development of pancreatic lesions such as acute pancreatitis is highly compromising to the organism.
