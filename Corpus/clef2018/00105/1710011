Clinical and pharmacological aspects of pancreatic enzyme substitution therapy. The adequate therapy of pancreatic enzyme replacement in patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is still a difficult clinical problem especially in patients following pancreatectomys, with chronic alcoholic pancreatitis or cystic fibrosis. The substitution of lipase to eliminate steatorrhoea is the most important aim but due to its acid lability even the most serious problem in pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. Various different medications are meanwhile available: conventional preparations from porcine pancreatin or fungal enzymes as rizolipase, enteric-coated tablets or even enteric-coated microspheres or adjunctive therapy with H2-receptor antagonists. While dosage requirements vary widely and therefore have to be tried out individually, the choice of the adequate preparation should be influenced by the realization of the physiological and pathophysiological characteristics of the individual patient and the pharmaceutical characteristics of the different supplements. The advantages and disadvantages of the various medications for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency are reviewed in this article.
