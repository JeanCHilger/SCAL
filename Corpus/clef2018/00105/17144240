Association between paclitaxel and necrotic pancreatitis. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of paclitaxel associated necrotic pancreatitis requiring a pancreatic necrostomy. This was a near fatal complication associated with paclitaxel with a high resulting morbidity. Although this is a rare association physicians should be wary of the potential to develop severe pancreatitis in patients receiving this therapeautic agent. Monitoring of serum amylase during therapy is therefore warranted.
