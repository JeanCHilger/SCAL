Effects of prolonged parotid duct ligation, parotidectomy and acute hepatitis of rats on amylase activity. Amylase activity in the parotid gland was extremely reduced (to 2.4 per cent) by prolonged duct ligation but that in the pancreas and serum as similar to controls. The serum amylase activity of parotidectomized rats was remarkably reduced within a week of surgery, but recovered to approximately the previous level in 4 weeks. The amylase activities in the pancreas and liver were not different between control and parotidectomized rats. The serum amylase activity of rats with acute hepatitis (1 day after administration of D-galactosamine) decreased to 18.5 per cent compared with controls however, the activity recovered to its original level after 4-7 days. There was no pancreatic amylase in the serum either of parotidectomized rats or those with acute hepatitis. These observations show that the parotid glands may not be the only source of serum amylase. Serum amylase is mainly derived from the parotid gland, but liver may contribute to serum amylase in compensation for the parotid glands.
