Peritoneal absorption of pancreatic enzymes in bile-induced acute pancreatitis in dogs. To clarify the contribution of peritoneal absorption of enzyme-rich exudate to the persistent elevation of serum amylase in bile-induced pancreatitis in dogs, serum amylase, lipase and immunoreactive trypsin (IRT) levels were measured during 24 h after induction of pancreatitis with and without peritoneal lavage. The basal level of serum amylase activity (m +/- s.e. = 1291 +/- 111 U/L) reached a plateau at 30 min (2688 +/- 185) after induction of pancreatitis and continued to rise until 24 h (7201 +/- 424). This persistent amylase elevation could be reduced significantly by peritoneal lavage. Serum IRT rose to a peak (378 +/- 103 ng/mL) at 30 min from the basal (20 +/- 5), then decreased until 3 h (211 +/- 34) and maintained a consistent level thereafter. Serum lipase elevation took an intermediate course between the levels of serum amylase and IRT. Intraperitoneal injection of 5 mL pancreatic juice could reproduce similar elevations to those of the respective enzymes, except lipase, seen in pancreatitis. These results suggest that transperitoneal absorption of pancreatic enzymes contributes to the elevation in serum enzymes levels and that rates of peritoneal absorption and serum disappearance differ from enzyme to enzyme.
