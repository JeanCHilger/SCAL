Protective effects of gabexate mesilate (FOY) against impaired pancreatic energy metabolism in rat acute pancreatitis induced by caerulein. A supramaximal dose of caerulein (5 micrograms/kg.hr for 3.5 hours) caused edematous acute pancreatitis in rats, characterized by portal hyperamylasemia (32 +/- 3 U/ml) and pancreatic edema (pancreatic water content, 86 +/- 2%) [control group: amylase, 8 +/- 1 U/ml water content, 74 +/- 2%]. In this model, increased portal levels of malate dehydrogenase (148 +/- 25 U/ml), increased mitochondrial fragility and impaired pancreatic energy charge level (0.77 +/- 0.05) were also observed [control group: malate dehydrogenase, 54 +/- 11 U/ml
