Hyperamylasemia and pancreatitis in leptospirosis. Hyperamylasemia has been documented in up to 65% of our patients with leptospirosis and jaundice. However, pancreatitis is an uncommon complication of leptospirosis. Three patients with leptospirosis and pancreatitis are described and compared with two leptospirosis patients who had hyperamylasemia but in whom the diagnosis of pancreatitis could not be substantiated. The cause of the hyperamylasemia in the latter patients was nonpancreatic. The elevation of the amylase in these latter two patients could not be explained by renal insufficiency, because the level of the amylase was greater than three to four times the normal value, the upper limit to which amylase rises in renal failure. Thus, hyperamylasemia in patients with leptospirosis can be from pancreatic and nonpancreatic sources. Leptospirosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of hyperamylasemia and pancreatitis.
