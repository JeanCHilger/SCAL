Pancreatic conservation after autotransplantation in dogs. Value of histologic surface analysis. A study of an artificial conservation fluid (hyperosmolar, pH = 8, rich in lactobionate and raffinose) was carried out by means of an experimental procedure involving segmental pancreatic autotransplants in dogs. The study covers 14 transplants, seven carried out without conservation and seven with 24-hour conservation at 4 degrees C. The caudal pancreas was removed after splenectomy and either transfused with 250 ml of 4 degrees C Euro-Collins before immediate transplant or with 250 ml of 4 degrees C conservation fluid for 24 hours before the transplant. The caudal pancreas was transplanted onto the right iliac vessels, while an arterio-venous fistula was created on the distal splenic vessels and the pancreatic duct was injected with modified tissucol. At the same time as the transplant, a cephalic pancreatectomy was performed. Laboratory tests included an intra venous glucose tolerance test monitored on days 0 and 28 and blood glucose and serum amylase measured every three days from days 1 to 28. The histological study of the pancreatic tissues 28 days after the transplants involved the light microscopic evaluation of the degree of fibrosis, inflammation of the pancreas, cystosteatonecrosis and peripancreatic inflammation. We used a computerized method to measure the surface area of the islets of Langerhans, as revealed by immunocytochemistry, and the surface area of fibrosis. The blood glucose and the serum amylase analyses from days 1 to 28, and the blood glucose variations during the intra venous glucose tolerance test, showed no differences between the two groups. Standard laboratory parameters were similar in the two groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
