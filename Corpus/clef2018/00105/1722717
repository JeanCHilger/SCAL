Usefulness of peritoneal fluid amylase levels in the differential diagnosis of peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients. Peritonitis continues to be a major cause of morbidity in peritoneal dialysis patients despite recent technological advances (Y systems) that have reduced peritonitis rates to much more acceptable levels. Most of the time when a peritoneal dialysis patient presents with peritonitis, it is infectious in origin. However, these patients occasionally develop other intra-abdominal pathology that requires more intensive medical care or, at times, surgical intervention. To help in the early differential diagnosis of the cause of peritonitis in these patients, peritoneal fluid amylase levels were prospectively obtained from 50 patients presenting to the hospital with peritonitis. Thirty-nine of them had typical infectious peritonitis, and their mean peritoneal fluid amylase level was 11.1 (range, 0 to 90). Six patients had pancreatitis and a mean peritoneal fluid amylase level of 550 U/L (range, 100 to 1,140 U/L). Five patients were found to have other intra-abdominal pathology, and their mean peritoneal fluid amylase level was 816 U/L (range, 142 to 1,746 U/L). In patients who did not respond to initial therapy, sequential peritoneal fluid amylase levels did not increase in patients with typical infectious peritonitis whereas it did increase in patients with other intra-abdominal pathology. In conclusion, it was found that peritoneal fluid amylase levels were helpful in the differential diagnosis of peritonitis in these patients. An elevated level (greater than 100 U/L) differentiated those patients with other intra-abdominal causes of peritonitis from those with typical infectious peritonitis.
