The role of oxygen-derived free radicals in two models of experimental acute pancreatitis: effects of catalase, superoxide dismutase, dimethylsulfoxide, and allopurinol. The role of oxygen-derived free radicals was evaluated in two models of experimental acute pancreatitis by testing the effects of agents which either reduce oxygen-derived free radical generation or scavenge those free radicals. Those agents (catalase, superoxide dismutase, polyethylene glycol-superoxide dismutase, dimethylsulfoxide, and allopurinol) were evaluated using the choline-deficient ethionine-supplemented diet-induced model of acute hemorrhagic pancreatic necrosis and the supramaximal caerulein stimulation model of acute interstitial edematous pancreatitis. In both models, the only effect associated with administration of the test agents was a reduction in the degree of pancreatic edema. These results suggest that oxygen-derived free radicals may play an important role in the development of pancreatic edema during pancreatitis but that those free radicals do not play an important role in the development of acinar cell injury.
