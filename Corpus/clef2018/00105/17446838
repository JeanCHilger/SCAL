Disialotransferrin, determined by capillary electrophoresis, is an accurate biomarker for alcoholic cause of acute pancreatitis. Serum disialotransferrin is a specific marker of heavy alcohol consumption. We tested its accuracy and probability in detecting alcoholic cause of acute pancreatitis (AP).Blood samples from 271 consecutive AP patients, admitted to the Helsinki University Central Hospital emergency unit, were analyzed.The median (range) disialotransferrin value was significantly higher (P = 0.001) in AP patients with alcoholic (n = 172) 1.6% (0.3%-14.4) than with biliary (n = 60) 0.7% (0.3%-1.3%) or other causes (n = 39) 0.8% (0.3%-4.1%). In receiver operating curve analysis, disialotransferrin, as a single analyte, was significantly (P = 0.001-0.0001) more accurate (area under the curve [AUC], 0.88 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84-0.92) in detecting alcoholic AP as compared with glutamyl transferase (AUC, 0.51Disialotransferrin, determined by capillary electrophoresis, is accurate, simple, and a rapid single biomarker of the alcoholic cause of AP.
