Comparison of early outcome and histologic findings of enteric drainage with bladder drainage in pancreas transplantation of dogs. The clinical and pathological findings of enteric-drained (ED) versus bladder-drained (BD) pancreas transplantation are still controversial. In this study, we compared early outcome and histological findings of these 2 methods.In an experimental animal model, after diabetization, 16 dogs were randomly divided into 2 groups. In the first group, the pancreas was transplanted with enteric drainage, and in the second group, with bladder drainage. We evaluated early clinical and pathological outcomes.The mean survival time was 11.25 +/- 5.0 (range, 5-20) days for group 1 and 13.6 +/- 7.2 (range, 3-23) days for group 2 (P>.05). Fasting blood sugar values (FBS) before transplantation were 279 +/- 26.8 mg/dL versus 278 +/- 41.6 mg/dL, respectively (P>.05). Two weeks postoperative serum FBS had decreased to 84.9 +/- 2.9 versus 84.2 +/- 0.98, respectively (P>.05). Serum amylase in the BD and ED groups were 378.5 +/- 328 versus 422.6 +/- 54.7 mg/dL, respectively (P>.05). Early leakage was not observed in dogs with BD, whereas it was 37.5% among dogs with ED (P<.05). Clinical and pathological evidences of pancreatic necrosis occurred in 37.5% of dogs with BD versus 62.5% of dogs with ED (P>.05).Although the early outcomes of these drainage methods (ED vs BD) were statistically similar more dogs with ED experienced early complications than with BD.
