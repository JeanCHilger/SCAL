Effects of enalaprilat on acute necrotizing pancreatitis in rats. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of enalaprilat on acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP) induced by glycodeoxycholic acid in rats. The induction of ANP resulted in a significant increase in the mortality rate, pancreatic necrosis, serum activity of amylase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, serum concentration of urea, and tissue activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and maondialdehyde (MDA) in the pancreas and lung, and a significant decrease in concentrations of calcium, blood pressure, urine output and p0(2). The use of enalaprilat inhibited the changes in urine output, blood pressure, serum concentration of urea, p0(2), and tissue activity of MPO and MDA in the pancreas and lungs. It reduced the mortality and pancreatic damage. Enalaprilat demonstrated a beneficial effect on the course of ANP in rats therefore, it may be used in the treatment of acute pancreatitis.
