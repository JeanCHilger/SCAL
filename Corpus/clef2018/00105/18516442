Methylene blue improves hemodynamic shock but increases lipoperoxidation in severe acute pancreatitis pig model. Study hemodynamic pattern and lipoperoxidation during methylene blue (MB) treatment on taurocholate - enterokinase induced acute pancreatitis (AP).Thirty pigs were equally divided in control group MB groupIn AP group MBP and CO decreased over time 33% (p<0.05) and 52% (p<0.05), respectively. In MB previous induced-AP group, there was 70 minutes delay (p<0.05) to decrease MBP and CO. In MB group arterial and venous nitrite decreased (p<0.05) over time. MB infusion increased (p>0.05) serum MDA when associated to AP. After induced AP, MB did not reverse MBP and CO decrease. There was no difference in serum amylase and necro-hemorrhagic findings with MB treatment.In this taurocholate-induced AP model MB treatment delayed hemodynamic shock and decreases serum nitrate levels but increases serum MDA levels. No volemic replacement was done and it may have been a mitigated factor to a poor tissue perfusion and impairment microcirculation. Further investigations are needed to elucidate MB treatment role during AP treatment.
