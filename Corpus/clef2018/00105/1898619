Exocrine pancreatic dysfunction in malnourished Australian aboriginal children. Pancreatic exocrine dysfunction has been frequently recorded in protein-energy malnutrition in underdeveloped countries. In addition, the pancreas requires optimal nutrition for enzyme synthesis and potentially correctable pancreatic enzyme insufficiency may play a role in the continuation of protein-energy malnutrition. This problem has not been previously evaluated in Australian Aborigines. We have applied a screening test for pancreatic dysfunction (human immunoreactive trypsinogen [IRT] assay) to the study of 398 infants (6-36 months) admitted to the Alice Springs Hospital over a 20-month period. All infants were assessed by anthropometric measures and were assigned to three nutritional groups (normal, moderate or severely malnourished) and two growth groups (stunted or not stunted). Of the 198 infants who had at least a single serum cationic trypsinogen measurement taken, normal values for serum IRT (with confidence limits) were obtained from 57 children, who were normally nourished. IRT levels were significantly correlated with the degree of underweight but there was no correlation with the degree of stunting or age. Mean IRT levels for the moderate and severely underweight groups were significantly greater than the mean for the normal group (P less than 0.01). Seventeen children (8.6%) had trypsinogen levels in excess of the 95th percentile for the normally nourished group, reflecting acinar cell damage or ductal obstruction. We conclude that pancreatic dysfunction may be a common and important overlooked factor contributing to ongoing malnutrition and disease in malnourished Australian Aboriginal children.
