Acute pancreatitis associated with herpes simplex virus infection: report of a case and review of the literature. Although a wide variety of infectious agents have been implicated in the aetiology of acute pancreatitis, their true incidence is unknown because they coexist quite often with other noninfectious causes. Acute herpes simplex viral pancreatitis is a rarely encountered entity in the literature. We report a patient who developed acute pancreatitis and hepatitis in association with herpes simplex virus infection as well as cholestatic syndrome because of compression of the intrapancreatic part of the common bile duct by the oedematous pancreatic head. Herpes simplex virus infection, although a rare entity, should be included in the conditions causing acute pancreatitis, when common noninfectious factors have been excluded and hepatic inflammation coexists. Diagnostically, a combination of serum amylase or lipase elevation, more than three times over the upper normal limits, as well as serologic evidence of the infectious agent should exist. Dilatation of the biliary tree is not invariably compatible with a biliary cause of acute pancreatitis.
