Elevation of serum interleukin-6 concentration precedes acute-phase response and reflects severity in acute pancreatitis. Experimental studies have shown that interleukin-6 induces all major acute-phase proteins in the liver, including C-reactive protein.

Patients were divided into three groups according to clinical criteria: mild pancreatitis (less than or equal to 1 complication n = 25), severe pancreatitis (greater than or equal to 2 complications
