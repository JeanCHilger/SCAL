Time frames for analysis of inflammatory mediators in acute pancreatitis: improving admission triage. Improving the outcome of acute pancreatitis through prognostic markers has been a matter of ample research. We evaluate the clinical usefulness of four serum markers in comparison to Ranson's score. Serum measurements of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6, -10 (IL-6, IL-10), and pancreatitis-associated protein (PAP) were performed. The usefulness of each marker for predicting severity was compared with that of Ranson's score. Time of evolution was considered for improving their usefulness. Seventy-one patients were studied. Severe cases had higher levels of all markers, although only IL-10 had better accuracy than Ranson's. In patients admitted during the first 48 h, IL-6, IL-10, and PAP had improved accuracy over Ranson's however, after this time frame, only CRP outperformed Ranson's score. Analysis of time frames improved the accuracy of all markers. Therefore, time of evolution should be considered when using these parameters for a better prognosis.
