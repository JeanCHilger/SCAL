Rosiglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma)-specific agonist, as a modulator in experimental acute pancreatitis. The purpose of this experiment was to investigate the role of PPAR ligands in the course of inflammation and of rosiglitazone, a PPAR-gamma-specific agonist, on the course of experimental acute pancreatitis (EAP).EAP was induced by administration of 5% sodium taurocholate injected into the pancreatic duct. The inflammatory activity was evaluated by biochemical scores (alpha-amylase, lipase, aminotransferases, and bilirubin), morphological changes (determined by light microscopy, H+E stained), and immunohistochemical reactions (ICAM, nitrotyrosine).Rosilgitazone administered in the course of EAP at a dose 50 mg/kg p.o. decreased the intensity of morphological changes (edema, inflammatory infiltrates, necrosis, and erythrocyte extravasations). In the rosiglitazone-treated animals all the biochemical parameters of EAP were statistically significantly decreased. Immunohistochemical reactions against ICAM-1 and nitrotyrosine showed that rosiglitazone decreased the intensity of inflammatory reactions in the groups of treated animals.PPAR-gamma agonists modulate the course of the inflammatory reaction. The administration of rosiglitazone decreased the intensity of the inflammatory process in the course of sodium taurocholate-induced EAP.
