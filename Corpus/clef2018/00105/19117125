The selective inhibition of type IV phosphodiesterase attenuates the severity of the acute pancreatitis in rats. Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are enzymes primarily responsible for regulation of the intracellular cyclic nucleotides. Among these enzymes, the type 4 PDE is highly expressed in most immune and inflammatory cells and its inhibition causes the suppression of immune and inflammatory cell activity, including production of cytokines. This study was designed to investigate the efficacy of the type 4 PDE inhibitor rolipram on acute pancreatitis in rats. Rats were divided into three groups--treatment, control, and sham. In the treatment and control groups, rats were pretreated with rolipram and vehicle before acute pancreatitis was induced. The pretreatment of rats with rolipram significantly reduced the amylase (P<0.0001) and IL-1Î² levels (P=0.002) compared to vehicle treated rats. Also, mean histopathological scores were significantly reduced by rolipram treatment (P<0.005). It can be concluded that rolipram ameliorates severity of pancreatitis in rats.
