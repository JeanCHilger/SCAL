Duodenal heterotopic pancreas in a child. Heterotopic pancreas is characterized by pancreatic tissue outside the pancreatic bed. However, duodenal heterotopic pancreas in children is rarely reported so far. We describe herein duodenal heterotopic pancreas in a child who suffered from chronic abdominal pain.An 8-year-old boy presented with upper abdominal pain and intermittent vomiting, without a history of melena, hematochezia, hematemesis, clay-colored stools, jaundice, hepatitis or dyscrasia. No specific medication or change in position relieved the pain. Based on the elevated serum amylase levels, and the findings of CT, barium meal X-ray examination, magnetic resonance imaging, and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, a duodenal mass was diagnosed initiatively. Intraoperative frozen section analysis was performed for the diagnosis. The mass was dissected.Intraoperative frozen section analysis and routine pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of duodenal heterotopic pancreas. The patient had an uneventful recovery and remained asymptomatic postoperatively during a follow-up period of 16 months.Heterotopic pancreas should be considered in children with a duodenal mass and abdominal pain. Intraoperative frozen section analysis is helpful in the diagnosis of the disease. Surgical treatment of the lesion should be performed to prevent bleeding, ulceration, outlet obstruction or malignant degeneration.
