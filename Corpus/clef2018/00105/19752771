Urinary trypsinogen-2 dipstick in acute pancreatitis. In acute pancreatitis (AP), rapid diagnosis and early treatment are of importance for clinical outcome. Urinary trypsinogen-2 has been suggested as a promising diagnostic marker however, studies using the urinary trypsinogen-2 dipstick test (UTDT) have provided varying results.The study was set to evaluate the use of the UTDT (Actim Pancreatitis Medix Biochemica, Kauniainen, Finland, Medinor, Roskilde, Denmark) in apparent first attack of AP in daily clinics. Acute pancreatitis was defined as more than a 3-fold increase in plasma amylase levels. We included 75 patients admitted with AP. Thirty-four patients with acute abdominal pain of causes other than AP served as a control group.In 58 of 75 patients, the UTDT result was positive, giving a sensitivity of 77% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 66%-86%). In severe cases, the sensitivity improved to 87% (95% CI: 69%-96%). In 33 of 34 controls, the test result was negative, giving a specificity of 97% (95% CI: 84%-99.9%).The UTDT had a low sensitivity but high specificity. These results do not support the UTDT to replace standard plasma amylase for the diagnosis of apparent first attack of AP. However, the test demonstrated an adequate sensitivity to be used for rapid early screening of AP in daily clinics.
