Protein kinase C delta-mediated processes in cholecystokinin-8-stimulated pancreatic acini. To define the role of protein kinase C delta (PKC delta) in acinar cell responses to the hormone cholecystokinin-8 (CCK) using isoform-specific inhibitors and a previously unreported genetic deletion model.Pancreatic acinar cells were isolated from (1) rat, and pretreated with a PKC delta-specific inhibitor or (2) PKC delta-deficient and wild type mice. Isolated cells were stimulated with CCK (0.001-100 nmol/L) and cell responses were measured.The PKC delta inhibitor did not affect stimulated amylase secretion from rat pancreatic acinar cells. Cholecystokinin-8 stimulation induced a typical biphasic dose-response curve for amylase secretion in acinar cells isolated from both PKC delta(-/-) and wild type mice, with maximal stimulation at 10-pmol/L CCK. Cholecystokinin-8 (100 nmol/L) induced zymogen and nuclear factor kappaB activation in both PKC delta(-/-) and wild type mice, although it was up to 50% less in PKC delta(-/-).In contrast to previous studies, this study has used specific and complementary approaches to examine PKC delta-mediated acinar cell responses. We could not confirm that it mediates amylase release but corroborated its role in the early stages of acute pancreatitis.
