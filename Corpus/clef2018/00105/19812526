Analysis of humoral immune response in experimental autoimmune pancreatitis in mice. To study the autoimmune response in MRL/Mp mice, which spontaneously develop pancreatitis in the exocrine pancreatic tissue.Six-week-old female mice were injected intraperitoneally with polyinosinic polycytidylic acid at a dose of 5 mg/kg of body weight twice a week for up to 12 weeks. The mice were serially killed, and the severity of their pancreatitis was graded with a histological scoring system. Immunohistological examinations were performed, and the serum levels of autoantibodies were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.The administration of polyinosinic polycytidylic acid accelerated the development of pancreatitis, with abundant infiltration of B220 B cells and CD138 plasmacytes. Various autoantibodies directed against autoantigens, including carbonic anhydrase II and lactoferrin, were detected but none against glutamic acid decarboxylase. Of these, autoantibodies directed against the pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (PSTI 91.7%) were more prevalent than those against carbonic anhydrase II (33.3%) or lactoferrin (45.8%). Determination of the epitope of the anti-PSTI antibody showed that most immunoreactivity was directed at the site on PSTI that is active in the suppression of trypsin activity.The autoimmune response to PSTI protein may induce a failure of PSTI activity, resulting in the activation of trypsinogen and the subsequent disease progression.
