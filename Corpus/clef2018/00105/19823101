Efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen therapy and medical ozone therapy in experimental acute necrotizing pancreatitis. Our aims were to evaluate the efficacy of ozone therapy (OT) in an experimental rat model of acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP) and to compare its effects with hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy in this entity.Forty Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into sham-operated, ANP, ANP + HBO, and ANP + OT groups. Acute necrotizing pancreatitis was induced by infusing 1-mL/kg 3% sodium taurocholate into the common biliopancreatic duct. Hyperbaric oxygen was administered twice daily at a 2.8-atm pressure for 90 minutes. Ozone therapy was set as daily intraperitoneal injections of 0.7-mg/kg ozone/oxygen gas mixture. Hyperbaric oxygen and OT were continued for 3 days after the induction of ANP. The surviving animals were killed at the fourth day, and their pancreases were harvested for biochemical, microbiological, and histopathologic analyses.Serum amylase/lipase and neopterin levels and tissue oxidative stress parameters were similar to sham's values in both the ANP + HBO and the ANP + OT groups. Histopathologic injury scores were significantly lower in the treatments groups than in the ANP group. When compared with the ANP group, the number of infected rats was significantly lesser in the ANP + HBO and the ANP + OT groups.Hyperbaric oxygen and OT reduce the severity and the mortality in the experimental rat model of ANP, and a greater benefit was received for OT comparing with HBO.
