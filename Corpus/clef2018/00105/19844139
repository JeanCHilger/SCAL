Evaluation of severity in acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis has a variable etiology and natural history, and some patients have severe complications with a significant risk of death. The prediction of severe disease should be achieved by careful ongoing clinical assessment coupled with the use of a multiple factor scoring system and imaging studies. Over the past 30 years several scoring systems have been developed to predict the severity of acute pancreatitis. However, there are no complete scoring index with high sensitivity and specificity till now. The interest in new biological markers and predictive models for identifying severe acute pancreatitis testifies to the continued clinical importance of early severity prediction. Among them, IL-6, IL-10, procalcitonin, and trypsinogen activation peptide are most likely to be used in clinical practice as predictors of severity. Even if contrast-enhanced CT has been considered the gold standard for diagnosing pancreatic necrosis, early scanning for the prediction of severity is limited because the full extent of pancreatic necrosis may not develop within the first 48 hour of presentation.
