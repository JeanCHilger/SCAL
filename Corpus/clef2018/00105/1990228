Oleic acid induced pancreatitis in pigs. An experimental model of edematous pancreatitis in pigs was established and measurement of pancreatic macro- and microcirculatory parameters and determinations of pancreatic enzymes (lipase, phospholipase A) and vasoactive mediators (prostanoids, kallikrein, kininogen) were performed. During general anesthesia the pancreas was isolated in situ. Pancreatic microcirculatory parameters were measured using videofluorescence microscopy after iv administration of FITC-Dextran. In hourly collected samples lipase and phospholipase A activities were determined enzymatically, concentrations of kallikrein, kininogen, and selected prostanoids were measured by radioimmunoassay. Two experimental groups were studied: (1) control (n = 9) (2) edematous pancreatitis induced by injection of oleic acid into the pancreatic artery (free fatty acid, ffa
