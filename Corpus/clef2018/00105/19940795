Nardostachys jatamansi protects against cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis. Nardostachys jatamansi belonging to the family Valerianaceae has been used as a remedy for stomach and skin ailments in Korea. The effect of N. jatamansi on acute pancreatitis (AP) has not been defined. Therefore, we investigated the effect of N. jatamansi on cerulein-induced AP.In the pretreatment group, N. jatamansi was administered orally to mice at 10 and 20 mg/kg for 5 days, and the mice were intraperitoneally injected with the stable cholecystokinin analogue cerulein hourly for 6 hours. In the posttreatment group, cerulein was injected hourly for 6 hours, and N. jatamansi was administered at the indicated time (1, 3, and 5 hours after the first cerulein injection) and dose (10 and 20 mg/kg) during the cerulein injection. Blood samples were taken 6 hours later to determine the serum amylase, the lipase, and the cytokine levels. The pancreas and the lung were rapidly removed for morphologic examination, myeloperoxidase assay, and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.Nardostachys jatamansi treatment attenuated the AP, as shown by the histological examination results of the pancreas and the lung, reductions in pancreatic edema, neutrophil infiltration, serum amylase and lipase levels, serum cytokine levels, and messenger RNA expressions of inflammatory mediators.These results suggest that N. jatamansi attenuates the severity of AP and pancreatitis-associated lung injury.
