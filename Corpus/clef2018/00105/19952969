Experimental study of the safety of pancreas cryosurgery: the comparison of 2 different techniques of cryosurgery. To test the feasibility of cryosurgery for pancreatic carcinoma and to observe the consequence of cryosurgery by 2 different techniques.Twelve healthy pigs underwent laparotomy, during which, chop amputation of common bile duct and duodenum were performed, meanwhile other intra-abdominal organs with the pancreas were isolated. Two different techniques of cryosurgery were performed on the pancreas. Group A (n = 6) accepted the mild hypothermic cryosurgery with liquid nitrogen superficial refrigeration, and group B (n = 6) were performed with the deep hypothermic cryosurgery at -170 degrees C with LCS2000 cryogenic surgical system. All the animals' digestive tract was reconstructed with cholecystojejunostomy and gastroenterostomy, respectively.Acute necrotizing pancreatitis occurred on all animals in group A, of which 5 of the 6 died within 1 week, whereas only 1 of the 6 reported a 4-week survival. All animals in group B survived during the observation, in which only a transient increment and a gradual correction of pancreatic amylase level were recorded. Small pancreatic pseudocyst occurred in 1 case.Mild hypothermic cryosurgery with liquid nitrogen superficial refrigeration might lead to pancreatic injury and induce acute pancreatitis, yet deep hypothermic cryosurgery with adequate time showed a promising effect in destroying pancreatic tissue and preventing acute pancreatitis.
