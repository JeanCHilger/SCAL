ERCP-induced and non-ERCP-induced acute pancreatitis: Two distinct clinical entities with different outcomes in mild and severe form? Acute pancreatitis is a complication of endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography. Aim of the study was to compare endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography-related acute pancreatitis with attacks caused by other factors.A series of consecutive patients with non-endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography-related acute pancreatitis referred to our hospital in 2007-2008 were examined retrospectively, and compared with the same number of patients with post-endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography acute pancreatitis done in the same institution. Both groups comprised 116 patients and were comparable for mean age, sex, and body mass index. Duration of abdominal pain, pancreatic enzyme elevation, hospital stay, and type of analgesia administered were retrieved.There were no differences between the groups as regards the severity of pancreatitis, mortality rate and hospitalisation, although mortality was double in severe post-endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography acute pancreatitis. In the mild acute pancreatitis cases, serum amylase fell 50% from the peak in a mean of 46.4h (range 24-72) in group 1 and 38.9h (range 24-72) in group 2 (p<0.001). The peak amylase serum level halved within 48h in 73.6% of cases with non-endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography-related acute pancreatitis, and in 92% of patients with endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography-related acute pancreatitis (p<0.001).Non-endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography- and endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography-induced pancreatitis did not differ as regards severity, hospital stay or mortality in mild pancreatitis, serum amylase halved significantly sooner in post-endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography cases.
