Genetic aspects of digestive diseases. Part 1. The paper presents the data available in the literature on mutations in known genes in pancreatitis, such as cationic trypsinogen (PRSS1), pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (PSTI/SPINK1), cystic fibrosis (CFTR), and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genes, as well as the new candidate gene--chymotrypsinogen (CTRC). It also gives the results of the authors studies estimating the spread of the mutations in the PRSS1 (2.5%), PSTI/SPINK1 (3.3%), and CFTR (0.8%) genes, as well as APOE polymorphism in patients with pancreatitis. It is shown that the E4 allele of the APOE gene was more frequently identified in patients with acute pancreatitis than in those with chronic pancreatitis (0.143 +/- 0.05 and 0.026 +/- 0.02, respectively p < 0.05). An overview is given of 7 major classes of candidate genes implicated in the pathogenesis of cholesterol cholelithiasis (CL): hepatic enzymes regulating blood lipid composition
