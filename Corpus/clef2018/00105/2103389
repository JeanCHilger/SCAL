Management of complicated acute pancreatitis: impact of computed tomography. The usefulness of computed tomography (CT) in guiding the management of 43 patients who had a complicated clinical course of acute pancreatitis was retrospectively studied. The CT scans were performed when patients had persistent fever, leucocytosis, hyperamylasaemia, palpable abdominal masses or when there was organ failure. The CT scans showed normal findings in six patients, features of pancreatic abscess in three patients, pseudocysts in three patients and inflammatory masses (a mixture of sterile inflammation and necrosis) in 31 patients. Patients with pancreatic abscesses underwent emergency laparotomy, drainage and debridement patients with pseudocysts had delayed drainage unless complication occurred
