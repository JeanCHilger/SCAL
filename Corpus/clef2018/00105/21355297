Effects of the combination of sandostatin and gardenia jasminoides ellis on pancreatic mitochondria injury in severe acute pancreatitis rats. To study the protective effects of the combination of sandostatin(SS) and gardenia jasminoides ellis (GJE) on pancreatic mitochondria injury in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) rats.SAP rat model was induced by retrograde injection of 15 g/L sodium deoxycholate into biliary tract. The rats were randomly divided into five groups: SAP group, Sham group, SS group, GJE group, as well as SS and GJE combination group. The changes of Superoxide dismutase(SOD), succinic dehydrogenase (SDH), Na+ -K+ -ATPase, Ca2+ - Mg2+ -ATPase, malondialdehyde (MDA), membrance fluidity of mitochondria in pancreatic tissue were measured.Compared to Sham group, the activities of SOD, SDH, Na+ -K+ -ATPase and Ca2+ -Mg2+ -ATPase in mitochondria were obviously decreased in SAP group, and MDA and microviscosity (eta) were markedly increased (P < 0.01), which were associated with the increase of serum amylase level (P < 0.01). The above-mentioned indexes of GJE group, SS group and combination group were obviously ameliorated in comparison with SAP group (P < 0.01), the improvement in combination group was the best (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). The correlation analysis indicated that MDA was negatively correlated with SOD, membrance fluidity, as well as the activities of Na+ -K+ -ATPase and Ca2+ -Mg2- -ATPase (r = -0.857, P < 0.01 r = -0.960, P < 0.01The combination of sandostatin and gardenia jasminoides ellis can protect pancreatic mitochondria injury in severe acute pancreatitis.
