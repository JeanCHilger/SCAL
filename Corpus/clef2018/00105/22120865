Anterior abdominal wall abscess with epididymo-orchitis: an unusual presentation of acute pancreatitis. Pancreatitis indicates inflammation of the pancreas. Clinically acute pancreatitis typically presents as upper abdominal pain mostly in epigastric region, nausea, vomiting and elevated levels of amylase and lipase. Depending upon severity of acute pancreatitis patient may presents with minimal symptoms to more severe signs of acute abdomen like generalized guarding and rigidity. Inspite of absence of disease-specific signs and symptoms for acute pancreatitis, diagnosis is usually not difficult using a combination of clinical, laboratory and radiological findings. Sometimes pancreatitis may presents atypically, which may be misleading in the management especially when typical presentation of pancreatitis as described above is absent. We have described a case of pancreatitis where patient presented with anterior abdominal wall abscess with epididymo-orchitis because of tracking of pancreatic fluid into the retroperitoneum till scrotum. Patients presentation may be different depending upon complication occurred during the course of pancreatitis. After reviewing the literature we found very few cases in which you may not get a clue to diagnose pancreatitis because of atypical presentation. In the described case, patient managed conservatively with percutaneous drainage of the abscess by pigtail catheter placement and scrotal support for epididymoorchitis. This avoided unnecessary exploration in above patient.
