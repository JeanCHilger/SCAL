Hyperlipidemic versus normal-lipid acute necrotic pancreatitis: proteomic analysis using an animal model. Hyperlipidemia is associated with a variety of pancreatic diseases. However, the underlying pathophysiology and molecular mechanisms between hyperlipidemia and acute pancreatitis remain undefined. Gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry can be used in proteomic analysis to elucidate these mechanisms.A comparative proteomic analysis was conducted to identify proteins that were altered in pancreases of hyperlipidemic acute necrotic pancreatitis rats compared with those of normal-lipid acute necrotic pancreatitis rats. A comparative proteomic approach using a hyperlipidemic rat model was used.Thirty-nine differentially expressed proteins were significantly changed in pancreatic samples from hyperlipidemic acute necrotic pancreatitis rats. Differentially expressed proteins in hyperlipidemic pancreatitis include pancreatic proteolytic enzymes, such as lipase, amylase, carboxypolypeptidase, and Î±-1-antiproteinase endoplasmic reticulum stress-related proteinsHyperlipidemia intensifies acute necrotic pancreatitis through various ways. These enzymes may be putative biomarkers of hyperlipidemic acute necrotic pancreatitis.
