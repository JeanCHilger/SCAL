Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia: which findings support observation?. On abdominal CT scans asymptomatic cystic lesions of the pancreas are accidentally detected in 1-2% of patients. Congenital cysts and pancreatic pseudocysts account for two thirds of these lesions. Pancreatic pseudocysts are a frequent complication of acute and chronic pancreatitis. Among resected cystic neoplasms serous cystic adenoma accounts for 30%, mucinous cystic neoplasms for 45% and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms for 25%. The diagnosis of a cystic pancreatic lesion is usually made by diagnostic imaging. Symptomatic lesions require definitive therapeutic treatment after appropriate diagnostic work-up. In the diagnosis of asymptomatic cystic lesions several factors are important, among them whether the cyst is connected to the pancreatic duct (as in IPMN and pseudocysts), the size of lesion (for treatment indications) and whether nodules form in the wall of the cyst (a sign of potential malignancy). EUS-guided fine needle aspiration of the cyst fluid adds to the discrimination between benign, premalignant and malignant cystic lesions. Measuring lipase activity, CEA, viscosity and mucin as well as cytology can help in differentiating cystic lesions. An algorithm is discussed for the differential diagnosis and for selection of the appropriate treatment for pancreatic cystic lesions, most of which never require surgery.
