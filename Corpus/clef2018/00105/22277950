Micro-rheological changes during experimental acute pancreatitis in the rat. Although microcirculatory disturbances play pivotal role in the pathomechanism of acute pancreatitis (AP), very few papers can be found which had been tested any of hemorheological parameters. The aim of our study was to analyze the hemorheological changes in cerulein-induced experimental acute pancreatitis in rat in two doses (5 and 10 μg/kg, s.c.). Male and female rats were subjected to Control group, or AP with 5 or 10 μg/kg cerulein groups. Blood samplings (lateral caudal vein) were completed before cerulein administration, and 1, 2 and 24 hours later. Hematological parameters, amylase activity, erythrocyte deformability (ektacytometry) and aggregation (light-transmission method) were tested. The presence of AP could be confirmed by amylase testing and histological examination. The earliest impairment of the red blood cell deformability could be observed 1 hour after cerulein administration in 10 μg/kg dosage. Female animals had the worst rheological results with high mortality. In conclusion, subcutaneously administrated cerulein in dosage of 5 and 10 μg/kg resulted in AP in rats, with significant changes in red blood cell deformability and alterations in erythrocyte aggregation. This model seems to be suitable for further comparative studies.
