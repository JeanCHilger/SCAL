Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of calcineurin protects against carbachol-induced pathological zymogen activation and acinar cell injury. Acute pancreatitis is a major health burden for which there are currently no targeted therapies. Premature activation of digestive proenzymes, or zymogens, within the pancreatic acinar cell is an early and critical event in this disease. A high-amplitude, sustained rise in acinar cell Ca(2+) is required for zymogen activation. We previously showed in a cholecystokinin-induced pancreatitis model that a potential target of this aberrant Ca(2+) signaling is the Ca(2+)-activated phosphatase calcineurin (Cn). However, in this study, we examined the role of Cn on both zymogen activation and injury, in the clinically relevant condition of neurogenic stimulation (by giving the acetylcholine analog carbachol) using three different Cn inhibitors or Cn-deficient acinar cells. In freshly isolated mouse acinar cells, pretreatment with FK506, calcineurin inhibitory peptide (CiP), or cyclosporine (CsA) blocked intra-acinar zymogen activation (n = 3 P < 0.05). The Cn inhibitors also reduced leakage of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) by 79%, 62%, and 63%, respectively (n = 3
