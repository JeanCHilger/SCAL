Role of IL-6 in the resolution of pancreatitis in obese mice. Obesity increases severity of acute pancreatitis and risk of pancreatic cancer. Pancreatitis and obesity are associated with elevated IL-6, a cytokine involved in inflammation and tumorigenesis. We studied the role of IL-6 in the response of lean and obese mice to pancreatitis induced by IL-12 + IL-18. Lean and diet-induced obese (DIO) WT and IL-6 KO mice and ob/ob mice pretreated with anti-IL-6 antibodies were evaluated at Days 1, 7, and 15 after induction of pancreatitis. Prolonged elevation of IL-6 in serum and visceral adipose tissue was observed in DIO versus lean WT mice, whereas circulating sIL-6R declined in DIO but not lean mice with pancreatitis. The severe inflammation and lethality of DIO mice were also observed in IL-6 KO mice. However, the delayed resolution of neutrophil infiltration sustained production of CXCL1, CXCL2, and CCL2
