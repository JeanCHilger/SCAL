CT-guided percutaneous catheter drainage of acute infectious necrotizing pancreatitis: assessment of effectiveness and safety. The purpose of this study is to assess retrospectively the effectiveness and safety of CT-guided percutaneous drainage and to determine the factors influencing clinical success and mortality in patients with infectious necrotizing pancreatitis.From April 1997 to December 2005, 48 consecutive patients (33 men and 15 women median age, 58.5 years) with proven infectious necrotizing pancreatitis underwent percutaneous catheter drainage via CT guidance. Evaluated factors included clinical, biologic, and radiologic scoresClinical success was achieved in 31 of 48 patients (64.6%) and was significantly associated with Ranson score (p = 0.01) and with the delay between admission and the beginning of the drainage (p = 0.005), with a calculated threshold delay of 18 days (p = 0.001). The global mortality rate (14/48 [29%]) was also influenced by the Ranson score (p = 01) and the delay of drainage (p = 0.04) with the same threshold delay (p = 0.01). Only two major nonlethal procedure-related complications were observed.Percutaneous catheter drainage is a safe and effective technique to treat acute infectious necrotizing pancreatitis.
