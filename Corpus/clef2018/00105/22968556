The use of Octreotide-depo for the pancreatitis' prophylaxis after radical surgery of gastric cancer with lymphadenectomy.

Patients of the 3rd group showed the highest levels of Î±-amylase in both blood and drainage fluid during the early postoperative period. The frequency and severity of postoperative complication rates were the lowest in those patients, who received octreotide-depo and was 3,06% whereas among patients of the 2nd group it was 16,8% and among those, who were treated with 5-ftoruracil and dalargin, it was 22,4%.
