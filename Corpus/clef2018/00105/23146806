Effect of Chaiqinchengqi decoction on serum amyloid A in severe acute pancreatitis patients. To investigate the effect of Chaiqinchengqi decoction (CQCQD) on serum amyloid A (SAA) in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) patients.Thirty-five participants enrolled and were randomly assigned into either a treatment condition (n = 17, treated with CQCQD) or a control condition (n = 18, treated with placebo) 24 hours following the onset of the disease. No statistical difference was observed in either group at baseline. Upon admission, the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation score II (APACHE II), SAA, serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were measured, as well as on the first, 3rd and 7th day and were compared between the two groups. Organ complications, infection, operation rate, mortality and hospital stay were also compared.The duration of acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute hepatitis, acute renal failure, gastrointestinal failure and blood coagulation dysfunction were shorter in the treatment group than in those in the control group (P < 0.05). The secondary infection rates and the hospital fees in the treatment group were lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05) as well as length of hospital stay (P < 0.01). After 3 days of hospitalization, the APACHEII, score SAA levels, serum CRP and IL-6 in the treatment group was lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05). SAA was positively correlated with serum CRP (R = 0.346, P = 0.042), Ranson score (R = 0.442, P = 0.008) and serum IL-6 (R = 0.359, P = 0.034). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of admission SAA predict pancreatic necrosis (PN) was 0.815 (95% CI: 0.625-0.954 P = 0.006). The best cut-off value of admission SAA was 7.85 mg/L with the sensitivity 84.6% and specificity 68.2%.The CQCQD can reduce the duration of organ damage through lowering the SAA in SAP patients and the SAA can early predict the PN and severity of SAP patients.
