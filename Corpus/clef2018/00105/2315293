Increased canine pancreatic acinar cell damage after organophosphate and acetylcholine or cholecystokinin. Sublethal doses of organophosphate anticholinesterases cause acute pancreatitis in dogs within 2 h. In vitro studies using canine pancreatic fragments have also demonstrated that the peak of amylase release in response to acetylcholine is shifted far to the left after incubation with the organophosphates echothiophate (10(-4) M) or tetraisopropyl pyrophosphoramide (iso-OMPA) (10(-3) M), indicating an increased sensitivity of response. The present in vitro study examined whether there was also an increased susceptibility to acinar cell damage at the electron microscopic level after acetylcholine or cholecystokinin. Minced pieces of whole fresh canine pancreas 2-3 mm in size were placed in buffered Eagle's solution and gassed with 100% O2. After pretreatment 1 h with echothiophate or iso-OMPA, they were then incubated with acetylcholine (10(-5) M). Other tissues preincubated with echothiophate were stimulated with cholecystokinin (10(-9) M). These are submaximal doses for untreated canine pancreatic fragments. After acetylcholine and echothiophate or acetylcholine and iso-OMPA, there was extensive acinar damage with the appearance of large vacuoles and lakes, and interstitial edema. There was evidence of intense supramaximal stimulation and lateral exocytosis. Similar destructive changes were seen after echothiophate and cholecystokinin. In control sections from tissues stimulated with acetylcholine (10(-5) M) or cholecystokinin (10(-9) M, there were lumenal exocytotic patterns typical of submaximal stimulation. Other controls, organophosphate alone and unstimulated basal conditions, showed only minor changes. It is concluded that the increased sensitivity to acetylcholine after organophosphate incubation correlates with an increased susceptibility to acinar ultrastructural damage from acetylcholine and cholecystokinin.
