Injection of microspheres into pancreatic arteries causes acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis in the rat: a new animal model. Alterations in the vascular bed of the pancreas or disturbances of the blood coagulation system are mostly considered to be sequelae of acute pancreatitis, but it seems that impairment of the pancreatic blood supply can per se lead to acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis. To test this hypothesis with a new animal model, we injected 20 microns polystyrene microspheres retrogradely into the distal splenic artery of rats, thus incompletely blocking blood perfusion in the splenic portion of the pancreas. Eight of eight rats (100%) subjected to microsphere injection developed acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis by 27 h after surgery, when they were killed, but none of the six sham-operated control animals (0%) showed macroscopic signs of pancreatitis. Blood amylase levels at death were 3,087 +/- 650 I.U./L (mean +/- SEM) and the histologic severity score for pancreatitis was 10.8 +/- 1.0 (mean +/- SEM), whereas in the six control rats amylase levels were 1,375 +/- 158 I.U./L and the histology score was only 1.7 +/- 1.0. The result is, with p less than 0.0005, highly significant (chi 2 analysis) and shows that acute experimental pancreatitis can indeed be induced by partially blocking the arterial blood supply within the organ.
