Clinical effects of pulse high-volume hemofiltration on severe acute pancreatitis complicated with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. To evaluate the effects of pulse high-volume hemofiltration (PHVHF) on severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Thirty patients were divided into two groups: PHVHF group and continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) group. They were evaluated in terms of clinical symptoms, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, simplified acute physiology (SAPS) II score and biochemical changes. The levels of IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α in plasma were assessed by ELISA before and after treatment. The doses of dopamine used in shock patients were also analyzed. In the two groups, symptoms were markedly improved after treatment. Body temperature (BT), breath rate (BR), heart rate (HR), APACHE II score, SOFA score, SAPS II score, serum amylase, white blood cell count and C-reactive protein were decreased after hemofiltration (P < 0.05). The PHVHF group was superior to the CVVH group, especially in APACHE II score, CRP (P < 0.01), HR, temperature, SOFA score and SAPS II score (P < 0.05). The doses of dopamine for shock patients were also decreased in the two groups (P < 0.05), with more reduction in the PHVHF group than the CVVH group (P < 0.05). The levels of IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α decreased (P < 0.05) in the PHVHF group more significantly than the CVVH group (P < 0.01). PHVHF appears to be superior to CVVH in the treatment of SAP with MODS.
