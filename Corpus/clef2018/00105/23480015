When a peritonitis does not seems like a peritonitis. Acute pancreatitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain. Although its incidence is low, it has increased in the last years therefore, an accurate diagnosis is necessary to avoid inappropriate surgeries. The aim of this study is to describe acute pancreatitis in the context of acute abdominal pain, which suggests appendicitis. We performed a retrospective study of all the patients who were admitted in the emergency department due to suspected appendicitis but were finally diagnosed of acute pancreatitis since 2010. Five patients were included in the investigation. One of them underwent surgery and the diagnosis was made on the 5th postoperative day. Median age at diagnosis was 5 years (range from 8 month to 6 years). Median white blood cell was 16,600/microL (13,400-31,900/microL), Median differential count of white blood cell was 14,432/microL (11,400-29,348/microL) and Median PCR 11 mg/L (155-4.6 mg/L). Median serum amylase at diagnosis was 651 U/L (10-1,443 U/L). All cases were studied with ultrasound and computerized tomography or nuclear magnetic resonance. One case had recurrent episodes of pancreatitis and was complicated by the development of a pseudocyst and a pancreatic fistula, requiring an Y-en-Roux cysto-enteric anastomosis. The median follow up period was 10 months (range: 1 to 22). All patients are asymptomatic at the moment.
