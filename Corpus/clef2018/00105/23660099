The effects of early enteral nutrition with addition of probiotics on the prognosis of patients suffering from severe acute pancreatitis. To investigate the curative effect of early enteral nutrition (EN) supplemented with probiotics (bifidobacterium) in patients with severe acute pancreatitis (ASP).Seventy SAP cases admitted from January 2005 to October 2012 were randomly assigned into parenteral nutrition (PN) group (n=22), EN group (n=25) and bifidobacterium added EN (P+EN) group (n=23). In P+EN group, patients were given their nutrition the same as that of EN, and also probiotics (bifidobacterium, 4 capsules every 12 hours, given through nasal gastric tube, each capsule weighing 210 mg). The routine treatment including anti-infection and anti-acid agents, and that of inhibition of pancreatic secretion were given, except for the different nutritional interventions in all groups. The blood samples were collected for e same measurements of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and for the C-reactive protein (CRP), lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH), white blood cell (WBC) count, amylase and lipase by biochemistry assay 1 day before intervention of nutrition, and 7 days and 14 days after intervention. Changes in organ function and outcome were also recorded at the same time points.The plasma levels of IL-8, TNF-α, CRP, LDH, WBC count, amylase and lipase were significantly reduced after nutritional intervention compared with their levels on day 1 before intervention in all three groups. The plasma IL-8, TNF-α, CRP, lipase, LDH at 14 days after intervention of nutrition in P+EN group were significantly lower than those in PN group and EN group (IL-8: 21.00 ± 7.07 μg/L vs. 48.00 ± 10.32 μg/L, 32.00 ± 9.30 μg/L TNF-α: 44.3 ± 10.9 ng/L vs. 132.1 ± 34.1 ng/L, 67.8 ± 22.3 ng/LOur results indicated that early EN with addition of probiotics (bifidobacterium) resulted in significant lowering of the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines, earlier restoration of gastrointestinal function, decrease of complications such as infection, and shortening of hospital day in patients with SAP.
