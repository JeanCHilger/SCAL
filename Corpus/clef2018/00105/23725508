Effect of interferon-γ on NF-κB and cytokine IL-18 and IL-27 in acute pancreatitis. The objective of our work was to evaluate the effect of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) on cytokine expression in rat acute pancreatitis (AP). AP was introduced to rats which were divided into Control, AP and IFN-γ group. Rats in the AP and IFN-γ group were sacrificed as 6, 12 and 24 h after IFN-γ treatment. The serum amylase (AMA), endotoxin and cytokines were detected. The pathological examination and immunofluorescence staining of pancreas for TNF-α, NF-κB and IL-18 were performed. The serum AMA increased significantly at 6 h and reduced at 48 h after AP. The increase in IFN-γ was higher than that in AMA. IL-18 increased in the AP and IFN group, and IFN increased markedly at 48 h after AP. IL-27 reduced at 24 h after AP compared with AP group. In the AP group, the immunostaining of cytokines increased. In the IFN group, the edema in the pancreas was more severe, and NF-κB and IL-18 expression was higher than that in the other two groups. IFN-γ can increase serum IL-18 and reduce IL-27 in AP. IFN-γ can increase serum IL-18 and reduce serum IL-27 in AP. The increase in NF-κB and IL-18 may exert influence on pro-inflammatory cytokines to deteriorate inflammation in the pancreas. Thus, to control the IFN-γ might has promise to attenuate pancreatitis.
