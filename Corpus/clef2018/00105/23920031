Aggressive hydration with lactated Ringer's solution reduces pancreatitis after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Pancreatitis is the most common serious complication of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). We performed a pilot study to determine whether aggressive periprocedural hydration with lactated Ringer's solution reduces the incidence of pancreatitis after ERCP.Patients who underwent first-time ERCP were randomly assigned to groups (2:1) that received aggressive hydration with lactated Ringer's solution (3 mL/kg/h during the procedure, a 20-mL/kg bolus after the procedure, and 3 mL/kg/h for 8 hours after the procedure, n = 39) or standard hydration with the same solution (1.5 mL/kg/h during and for 8 hours after procedure, n = 23). Serum levels of amylase, visual analogue pain scores (scale of 0-10), and volume overload were assessed at baseline and 2, 8, and 24 hours after ERCP. The primary end point, post-ERCP pancreatitis, was defined as hyperamylasemia (level of amylase >3 times the upper limit of normal) and increased epigastric pain (≥3 points on visual analogue scale) persisting for ≥24 hours after the procedure. Secondary end points included hyperamylasemia, increased pain, and volume overload.None of the patients who received aggressive hydration developed post-ERCP pancreatitis, compared with 17% of patients who received standard hydration (P = .016). Hyperamylasemia developed in 23% of patients who received aggressive hydration vs 39% of those who received standard hydration (P = .116, nonsignificant) increased epigastric pain developed in 8% of patients who received aggressive hydration vs 22% of those who received standard hydration (P = .146, nonsignificant). No patients had evidence of volume overload.On the basis of a pilot study, aggressive intravenous hydration with lactated Ringer's solution appears to reduce the development of post-ERCP pancreatitis and is not associated with volume overload.
