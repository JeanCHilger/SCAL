Cyst fluid SPINK1 may help to differentiate benign and potentially malignant cystic pancreatic lesions. Differential diagnosis between benign and potentially malignant cystic pancreatic lesions may be difficult. Previously we have compared cyst fluid serine protease inhibitor Kazal type I (SPINK1) with some traditionally used tumour markers (amylase, CEA, Ca19-9) and found that it may be a new promising maker in the differential diagnosis of cystic pancreatic lesions. In the present study, we focused on cyst fluid SPINK1 levels in benign and potentially malignant cystic pancreatic lesions.Sixty-one patients operated on for cystic pancreatic lesion in Tampere University Hospital, Finland and in Verona University Hospital, Italy, were included. Cyst fluid was aspirated during surgery, stored at -70 °C, and analysed with immunofluorometric assay for SPINK1. The final diagnosis was acute pancreatitis with fluid collection (Acute FC) in 4 patients, chronic pseudocyst (PS) in 17 patients, serous cystadenoma (SCA) in 7 patients, mucinous cystadenoma (MCA) in 21 patients and intraductal papillary-mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) in 12 patients (9 main/mixed duct type and 3 branch duct type).The acute FC patients had high SPINK1 levels. Among chronic cysts, SPINK1 levels were significantly higher in patients with potentially malignant cysts (main/mixed duct IPMN and MCA) than with benign cysts (side branch IPMN and SCA), (median and range, [480 (13-3602) vs. 18 (0.1-278) μg/L] p < 0.0001). In the subcohort of 24 patients with <3 cm chronic cyst, cyst fluid SPINK 1 levels were significantly lower in SCA or side branch IPMN (3 [2-116] μg/L) than in main duct IPMN or MCA (638 [66-3602] μg/LCyst fluid SPINK1 may be a possible marker in the differential diagnosis of benign and potentially malignant cystic pancreatic lesions.
