Amylase and gut infarction. Serum amylase has been determined on admission in 63 (52 per cent) of 122 patients with acute mesenteric infarction. Amylase levels were normal in 34 (54 per cent) and reached greater than twice normal in 15 patients (24 per cent). In 5 patients (3 on admission) amylase levels were in the diagnostic range of acute pancreatitis (greater than 1200 units/l) leading to inappropriate non-operative treatment in 4. Hyperamylasaemia was found in association with all aetiologies of infarction. The magnitude of the hyperamylasaemia appeared to be related to the extent of the bowel infarction, the highest levels occurring when infarction involved the small bowel and colon. The mechanism of hyperamylasaemia in acute mesenteric infarction is discussed.
