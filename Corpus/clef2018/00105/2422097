Comparison of experimental diabetes induced by streptozotocin and cyproheptadine. It is generally accepted that Diabetes mellitus is caused by the endocrinological functional disturbance of the pancreas, decreasing available insulin for carbohydrate metabolisms. Diabetes mellitus is not necessarily related to hypoinsulinemia, and some senile subjects show diabetic symptoms although the insulin levels in their blood are within the normal range. Therefore, in order to examine the cause of Diabetes mellitus, the glucose tolerance test is usually given as a routine laboratory method to monitor the pancreatic endocrine functions. The pattern of decreasing glucose level in blood will tell us what is the cause of the disease. In testing the effects of anti-diabetic drugs, experimental diabetic conditions have been prepared by various methods, and recently streptozotocin (STZ) and cyproheptadine (CPH) have been successfully used to induce diabetic conditions of various degrees. In the present study, degree of disturbance of the pancreatic functions by STZ and CPH were compared, and in addition, disturbance of organs other than the pancreas was also examined biochemically. When a high dose of STZ was given, irreversible disfunction of glucose level normalizing and insulin secreting abilities was observed. Serum GOT, GPT, lysosomal enzyme activities and lysosomal enzyme activity in the liver and pancreas decreased in high dose STZ administered rats. Low dose STZ disturbed the pancreatic endocrine function less than that in high dose STZ, and the blood glucose level normalizing function was reversibly disturbed. Insulin secretion decreased, and normalized on discontinuation of low dose STZ administration. Low dose STZ also disturbed organs other than the pancreas as in high dose STZ.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
