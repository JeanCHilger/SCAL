C/EBP homologous protein deficiency aggravates acute pancreatitis and associated lung injury. To investigate the pathophysiological role of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) in severe acute pancreatitis and associated lung injury.A severe acute pancreatitis model was induced with 6 injections of cerulein (Cn, 50 μg/kg) at 1-h intervals, then intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 7.5 mg/kg) in CHOP-deficient (Chop(-/-)) mice and wild-type (WT) mice. Animals were sacrificed under anesthesia, 3 h or 18 h after LPS injection. Serum amylase, lipase, and cytokines [interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α], pathological changes, acute lung injury, and apoptosis in the pancreas were evaluated. Serum amylase and lipase activities were detected using a medical automatic chemical analyzer. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits were used to evaluate TNF-α and IL-6 levels in mouse serum and lung tissue homogenates. Apoptotic cells in sections of pancreatic tissues were determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) analysis. The mouse carotid arteries were cannulated and arterial blood samples were collected for PaO2 analysis. The oxygenation index was expressed as PaO2/FiO2.Administration of Cn and LPS for 9 and 24 h induced severe acute pancreatitis in Chop(-/-) and WT mice. When comparing Chop(-/-) mice and WT mice, we observed that CHOP-deficient mice had greater increases in serum TNF-α (214.40 ± 19.52 pg/mL vs 150.40 ± 16.70 pg/mL P = 0.037), amylase (4236.40 ± 646.32 U/L vs 2535.30 ± 81.83 U/LThese results suggest that CHOP can exert protective effects against acute pancreatitis and limit the spread of inflammatory damage to the lungs.
