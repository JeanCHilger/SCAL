Hypothermia induced by adenosine 5'-monophosphate attenuates injury in an L-arginine-induced acute pancreatitis rat model. This study sought to investigate the effects of hypothermia induced by adenosine 5'-monophosphate (5'-AMP) on L-arginine (L-Arg)-induced acute pancreatitis in rats.The rats were divided into four groups: the control group, the acute pancreatitis group, the 5'-AMP pretreatment group, and the 5'-AMP posttreatment group. Rats in all groups, except for the control group, received two injections of 2.5 g/kg body weight (intraperitoneally) L-Arg, with an interval of 1 h between the injections. Subsequently, the rats were observed to assess whether hypothermia induced by 5'-AMP could effectively inhibit inflammation associated with L-Arg-induced acute pancreatitis in rats.Hypothermia induced by 5'-AMP produced protective effects in our acute pancreatitis model. These effects exhibited the following manifestations: (i) a significant reduction in rat mortality rates (ii) a significant decrease in the occurrence of pancreatic edemaHypothermia induced by 5'-AMP could inhibit the acute inflammatory reaction and NF-ÎºB activation associated with acute pancreatitis.
