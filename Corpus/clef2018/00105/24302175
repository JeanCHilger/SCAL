The effects of glycyrrhizin on experimental acute pancreatitis in rats. Although physiopathology of acute pancreatitis (AP) is not fully understood, the roles of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and changes of cytokines have been determined.To investigate anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects of glycyrrhizin (GL) on taurocholate-induced AP in rats.Thirty six rats were randomly divided into three groups as sham, AP and AP+GL (n=12 per group). AP was induced by 1 ml/kg body weight using 5% taurocholate injection into the biliopancreatic duct in groups II and III after clamping the hepatic duct. In groups III, GL (20 mg/kg) was given by oral gavage twice daily for 4 days. Group I and II did not receive any treatment. After the rats were killed blood samples were taken to measure amylase, lipase, calcium, albumin, urea, glucose, AST and LDH assays before killing. Pancreatic tissue samples were also taken for biochemical analyses and histopathology.Amylase, lipase, AST and urea levels were significantly lower in the AP+GL group than in the AP group. Cytokines including IL-6, TNF-α and MPO levels were significantly lower in the AP+GL group than in the AP group. Even so there is no statistically difference between in the AP+GL group and the AP group in terms of pancreatic tissue IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α levels.GL treatment significantly decreased pancreatic tissue MPO activities and MDA levels in the AP+GL group compared with the other groups (p = 0.001 and p = 0.05, respectively). Acinar cell necrosis, hemorrhage, and edema determined that were significantly lower in the AP+GL group than in the AP group (p < 0.001).GL treatment for acute necrotizing pancreatitis in rats suppressed the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and caused a clear recovery of histological changes.
