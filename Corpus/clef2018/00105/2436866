Effect of parental malnutrition on enzyme content of rat pancreas. The aim of this study was to assess in rat pups the influence of protein diets ingested by their mothers during gestation and lactation on the enzyme content of the pancreas of the offspring. Rat pups born of either well-nourished mothers or of mothers fed a diet moderately restricted in protein (9% casein w/w) were studied. After weaning, the pups were fed on one of three diets: a well-balanced diet, a 5% casein diet (protein restricted), or a well-balanced diet of a similar caloric value as the protein-restricted diet (pair-fed rat pups). The pups were sacrificed after intervals of one to 25 weeks after weaning. The results showed that the enzyme content of the pancreas increased progressively with time in pups born of malnourished mothers, particularly in pups fed the protein-restricted diet. This suggests prolonged maturation of the pancreas. Pups fed the 5% casein diet had a decreased amylase content per milligram of DNA but not of other enzymes. Malnutrition in the mother increased the ratio of enzymes to DNA and the total pancreatic enzyme content at different times after weaning, indicating that maternal malnutrition had a prolonged effect on the pancreatic enzyme content of the pups' pancreas. This mechanism could play a role in the pathogenesis of tropical chronic calcific pancreatitis in man and explain some of the geographic differences in the incidence of the disease.
