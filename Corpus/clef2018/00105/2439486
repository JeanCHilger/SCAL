Impairment of pancreatic acinar function by reserpine in vivo and in vitro. Chronic reserpine treatment of animals, an experimental model for cystic fibrosis (CF), results in generalized exocrinopathy, impaired pancreatic secretion, and decreased pancreatic content of amylase. The mechanisms of altered acinar function and decreased amylase content in both CF and the reserpine-treated rat are unknown. To examine this alteration, the rate of [3H]phenylalanine (phe) incorporation into cellular protein was determined in pancreatic acinar cells after reserpine treatment of rats in vivo (7 d) and of cells in vitro (1 to 24 h). Acinar cells isolated from control, chronic reserpine-treated, and pair-fed rats were incubated in vitro with 0, 30, 50, or 100 microM reserpine. Reserpine treatment in vitro for 24 h of acinar cells from control rats significantly decreased amylase activity (20 to 70%), an effect similar to that of reserpine treatment in vivo. In vivo, reserpine treatment decreased [3H]phe incorporation (disintegrations per minute per milligram protein) 56% in freshly isolated cells, but did not alter intracellular specific activity (disintegrations per minute per nanomole phe, SA) of [3H]phe. Reserpine treatment (30 and 50 microM) in vitro for 1 h also decreased [3H]phe incorporation by freshly isolated cells from control (53 to 85%) and pair-fed (40 to 68%) rats. Reserpine treatment for 24 h in vitro significantly decreased [3H]phe incorporation by cells from control (82 and 98%), pair-fed (80 and 95%), and chronic reserpine-treated (90 and 97%) rats as compared with cells from respective in vivo treatments cultured with no reserpine. In vitro reserpine treatment also decreased the intracellular SA of [3H]phe in freshly isolated cells from control (14 and 36%) and pair-fed (35 and 39%) rats and in cultured cells from control (11 and 86%), pair-fed (60 and 88%), and chronic reserpine-treated (49 and 76%) rats. However, these alterations of SA by reserpine did not account for the decreased incorporation of [3H]phe into acinar protein, which remained significantly lower (70 to 88%) when expressed as total phe incorporation. These results suggest that reserpine acts directly on acinar cells to alter function and that the ability of the pancreas to synthesize digestive enzymes may be impaired in this model of cystic fibrosis.
