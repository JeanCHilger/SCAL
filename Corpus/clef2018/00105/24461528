Hepatic effect of NAC on sevear acute pancteatise of rats. To analyze the hepatic protection of n-acetyl cysteine (NAC) on severe acute pancreatitis (SAP).SD rats were randomly divided into control group, SAP group and NAC group. SAP AHO method was adopted to establish the model, 2 h after modeling, rats in NAC group had intraperitoneal injection of NAC (200 mg/kg). Ten rats from each group were sacrificed in every 6 and 12 h at different time points respectively. Liver damage, liver function and serum amylase, AST, ALT and malondialdehyde (MDA) were determined.Serum amylase, AST, ALT and MDA content in SAP, NAC group at each time point were significantly higher in the control group (P<0.05), serum amylase, AST, ALT and MDA content in NAC group rats were lower in the SAP group significantly (P<0.05) Microscopic examination showed that the liver injury in rats and the NAC group significantly reduced in the SAP group.NAC provides effective protection against liver damage to SAP, protective from SAP liver injury.
