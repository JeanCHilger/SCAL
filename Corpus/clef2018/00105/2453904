When should treatment of acute experimental pancreatitis be started? The early phase of bile-induced acute pancreatitis. Sodium taurocholate pancreatitis in the rat is a frequently used experimental model for evaluating therapeutical regimes in this disease. It is, however, uncertain when treatment should be started, as the early phase of this experimental model and thus the time when the pancreatitis really develops is unknown. Serum and pancreatic enzymes, as well as pancreatic morphology, were therefore studied 5, 30, and 60 min after induction of sodium taurocholate pancreatitis. It was found that increase in serum enzymes and decrease in pancreatic enzymes and morphological changes characteristic for acute pancreatitis develop as early as 5 and 30 min after induction of pancreatitis. Thus, therapy in this model may be started shortly after induction of acute pancreatitis.
