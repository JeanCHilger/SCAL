Rational diagnosis of pancreatic diseases. Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of pancreatic disease are frequently difficult, and patience and diagnostic skill are required of the physician. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings, morphological imaging procedures (ultrasound, computer tomography, ERCP) and changes in biochemical parameters in serum, urine duodenal secretion and feces. History and clinical findings are starting-points for further chemical and technical investigations. The various diagnostic procedures and their importance in the diagnosis of acute and chronic pancreatitis and of pancreatic carcinoma are discussed and evaluated.
