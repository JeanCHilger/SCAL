Parenteral superoxide dismutase plus catalase diminishes pancreatic edema in sodium taurocholate-induced pancreatitis in the rat. Scavengers of toxic oxygen reduction products have been reported to reduce the inflammatory reaction in some models of pancreatitis. In a blinded study, the effect of parenteral pretreatment with superoxide dismutase plus catalase was compared with placebo on pancreatitis induced in rats by infusion of 0.25% or 2% sodium taurocholate into the hepatopancreatic duct. The degree of inflammation was assessed by macroscopic examination of the pancreas, dry/wet weight ratios of pancreatic specimens, amylase activity in plasma and peritoneal exudate, the weight of the exudate, and its content of total protein. All parameters were indicative of a more severe inflammation in rats given the higher concentration of sodium taurocholate. The only significant effect of the superoxide dismutase plus catalase treatment was a moderate reduction of the dry/wet weight ratio, i.e., pancreatic edema, in rats given 2% sodium taurocholate. Our results indicate that toxic oxygen reduction products, available for interception by parenterally administered superoxide dismutase plus catalase, are of only minor importance in the pathogenesis of sodium taurocholate-induced pancreatitis in the rat.
