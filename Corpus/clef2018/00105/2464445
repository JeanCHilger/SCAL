Measuring carboxypeptidase A activity with a centrifugal analyzer: analytical and clinical considerations. This adaptation of a commercially available kit for automated measurement of carboxypeptidase A (CPA EC 3.4.17.1) activity in serum with the Cobas Bio centrifugal analyzer extends the linear range to an activity concentration of 82 U/L. Results obtained by the described method correlated closely (r = 0.98) with those by the manual kit method. The reference interval for 150 apparently normal individuals was 0.12-0.91 U/L. Total CVs of the method ranged from 4.0% to 13.1%. Bilirubin and glucose decreased the CPA activity in serum by as much as 98% and 26%, respectively. Substantial CPA activity was found in pancreatic tissue, with little activity in intestinal tissue. CPA activity was not as widely distributed in extra-pancreatic tissues as were amylase and lipase activities. Peak activities of CPA, amylase, and lipase in the sera of patients with acute pancreatitis were significantly correlated (r = 0.45 to 0.78, P less than 0.05-0.01). The optimized diagnostic efficiency of CPA for acute pancreatitis was 0.85 at a cutoff value of 5 U/L. Amylase and lipase exhibited similar optimized efficiencies, and parallel testing did not significantly improve diagnostic accuracy. We conclude that automated analysis for CPA activity, even in the absence of interferences, does not add to the diagnostic information provided by the widely available assays for amylase and lipase activity.
