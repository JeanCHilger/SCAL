Recurrent pancreatitis secondary to hypercalcemia following vitamin D poisoning. A 66-year-old patient had been admitted four times for recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis. At each time, elevated serum calcium levels, between 13.5-14.5 mg/dl, were found. Surgical drainage of necrotic pancreatic tissue had to be done on one occasion. Extensive investigations failed to disclose any conventional hypercalcemic disease. At his latest admission, the serum calcium level was 13.4 mg/dl, and the serum amylase level was 440 IU/L (N, less than 85). This time, the serum 25-OH vitamin D levels were investigated using radioimmunology and proved to be raised to 330 micrograms/L (normal, 16-74 micrograms/L). Specific questioning of the patient revealed that he had been taking regularly excessive quantities of vitamin supplements as a self medication. After stopping vitamin intake, his serum amylase levels returned to normal, and he had no more episodes of pancreatitis. This case illustrates vitamin D intoxication as a cause of recurrent pancreatitis. Measuring serum 25-OH vitamin D levels is advocated in pancreatitis associated with hypercalcemia of unclear origin.
