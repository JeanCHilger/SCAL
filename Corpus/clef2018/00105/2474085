Acute pancreatitis. Clinical records of acute pancreatitis for the period 1983-1987 are summarized. Included in the study were 312 cases. The morbidity curve showed biphasic age pattern. The increased diagnostic importance of blood and urinary alpha-amylase and of leucocytosis is emphasized their levels were increased above the normal ones accordingly in 62.54 +/- 3.54%, 83.55 +/- 2.23% and 58.90 +/- 3.65% of the cases. Echographic examination of the abdominal organs is essential for the diagnosis. Sixty seven patients (21.48 +/- 0.2 per cent) were operated with case fatality rate 23.88 +/- 17%. Of those who received conservative treatment four died (1.63 +/- 0.81 per cent). kontrikal was applied in 91.99 +/- 1.60% of the cases. The overall mortality for five years was 6.41 +/- 1.39 per cent. Analysis was made of the number and type of operative interventions, the post-mortem finding and the complications. It is assumed that the rather good results of treatment of acute pancreatitis were due to the complex approach including lavage of bursa omentalis and the abdominal cavity in complicated cases, applied in the last 3-4 years.
