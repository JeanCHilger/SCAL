Mild pancreatic damage in acute viral hepatitis. Whether and to what extent the pancreas is involved in acute viral hepatitis is still unclear. In order to address this issue we evaluated serum and urinary amylase and isoamylase levels in 92 patients with acute viral hepatitis of different etiology and in 60 healthy volunteers. Furthermore, pancreatic structure and volume were evaluated by ultrasound scanning. Significant increase in serum and urinary pancreatic isoamylases was found in 12 and 35% of patients, respectively, in the early stage of the disease. Increase in serum pancreatic isoamylases was found only in patients suffering from B and non-A, non-B hepatitis. Ultrasonographic evaluation did not show any change in pancreatic structure and volume. In conclusion, this study suggests that mild pancreatic damage may occur during viral hepatitis.
