Enzyme immunoassay for serum pancreatic lipase in the diagnosis of pancreatic diseases. To evaluate the diagnostic utility of serum immunoreactive lipase (IRL), serum lipase was determined using an enzyme immunoassay and a turbidimetric method along with total serum amylase in 41 healthy controls, 76 patients with pancreatic disease and 60 with nonpancreatic disease. Serum IRL was elevated in 12 of 13 patients with acute pancreatitis, 12 of 44 with chronic pancreatitis and in 12 of 19 with pancreatic cancer. The IRL was low in 9 of the 44 patients with chronic pancreatitis, which coincided with advanced exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Overall sensitivities in pancreatic diseases were 59% for serum IRL, 38% for turbidimetric lipase and 51% for amylase, specificities in healthy controls and nonpancreatic diseases were 80% for serum IRL, 86% for turbidimetric lipase and 88% for serum amylase. Serum IRL determination is useful for diagnosis in pancreatic diseases when compared with the conventional determination of serum lipase.
