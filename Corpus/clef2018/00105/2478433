Pancreatic ascites--a collected review of 37 cases in Japan. Thirty seven cases of pancreatic ascites in the Japanese literature were reviewed. The ratio of males to females was high, and the incidence of associated pancreatic pleural effusion was higher than in the English literature. Other aspects of pancreatic ascites in Japan were similar to those reported in the English literature. Twelve patients were completely cured by conservative therapy and 18 patients required surgery. With care, the progress of pancreatic ascites was usually good. The frequency of alcoholic pancreatitis has increased, so it is important to watch out for the occurrence of pancreatic ascites as a complication of chronic pancreatitis.
