Clinico-morphologic characteristics of ischemic involvement of the pancreas. Follow-up clinical results have been analyzed for 564 patients with occlusions of visceral arteries, which presented clinically as symptoms of chronic pancreatitis in 115 patients. As a rule, chronic pancreatic ischemia leads to exocrine hyposecretion evident from the derangement of cyclonucleotide metabolism. There were also metabolic shifts in pancreatic cells related to hypoxia. Intravital biopsies revealed dystrophy of the acinar tissue as well as inter- and intralobular infiltrates of the connective and fatty tissue.
