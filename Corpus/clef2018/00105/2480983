The role of oxygen free radicals in experimental acute pancreatitis in the rat. In order to elucidate the role of oxygen-derived free radicals in acute pancreatitis, scavengers and an inhibitor of production of these free radicals were administered to rats with experimentally-induced acute pancreatitis. Acute reflux pancreatitis was produced by the occlusion of the common bile duct (OCD). Catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were used as scavengers, and allopurinol was used as an inhibitor of production of free radicals. Six h after surgery, serum amylase, lipase, and thiobarbituric acid (TBA) reactant levels were elevated significantly, and histological changes in the pancreas, consisting of edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, and necrosis, partially around the intralobular and interlobular ducts, developed in the control rats receiving no agent. However, serum lipase and amylase levels in the rats given each agent were significantly lower (p less than 0.05) than in the controls. The histological changes in the pancreas were less marked in agent-treated rats than in untreated rats. These results suggest that oxygen-derived free radicals participate in the development of acute pancreatitis.
