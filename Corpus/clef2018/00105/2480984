The effect of pancreatitis associated ascitic fluid on some functions of rat liver mitochondria. A possible mechanism of the damage to the liver in acute pancreatitis. The damage to the liver during acute pancreatitis (AP) could be partly dependent on depressive action of pancreatitis associated ascitic fluid (PAAF) on the energy metabolism of hepatocytes. The aim of the study was to assess the effect of PAAF from dogs with acute experimental pancreatitis (AEP) and from humans with AP on the respiratory function of isolated rat liver mitochondria (RLM). The mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate in state 3 respiration (with ADP) and in state 4 (without ADP) using sodium succinate as substrate and oxygen Clark's electrode was estimated. Respiratory control ratio (RCR) and P/O ratio were calculated. PAAF was collected after 6 h of AEP induced by Elliott's method in 8 dogs, and from 4 patients with AP, intraoperatively. Both animal and human PAAFs increase the oxygen consumption rate by RLM in state 4 dose dependently (by 65% with 50 microL to 150% with 200 microL of canine PAAF). This uncoupling effect of human PAAF was twice more potent than the canine. Dialysis of PAAF reduced this effect almost completely. The mitochondrial ATPase activity in RLM treated with PAAF was stimulated and this effect was also reduced by dialysis. The conclusion was that the damage to the liver in AEP could be partly dependent on the toxicity of dializable component(s) of PAAF on the energy metabolism of mitochondria. These findings may partly explain the beneficial effects of peritoneal lavage in acute pancreatitis.
