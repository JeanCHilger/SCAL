Enzyme-specific activities and mineral concentrations of the exocrine pancreas from female SHR/N-corpulent (cp) rats. A new rodent model, SHR/N-cp, for study of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) has recently been developed. The present study reports exocrine pancreatic enzyme activities and mineral concentrations in female corpulent (cp/cp) and lean (+/?) rats fed a diet containing carbohydrate as cooked corn starch or sucrose for 7 months to determine the potential of the model for studies of diet and pancreatic function in NIDDM. Although corpulent female rats weighed 2.5 times more than their lean littermates, they consumed less calories when expressed per 100 g body weight than lean rats. Corpulent rats had a significantly smaller relative pancreatic weight than lean rats (p less than 0.0001), but had greater total pancreatic DNA content and concentration (p less than 0.003) and higher pancreatic amylase (p less than 0.0001), lipase (p less than 0.0011), and chymotrypsinogen (p less than 0.0208) specific activities. Corpulent rats had a significantly lower pancreatic copper concentration than their lean littermates (p less than 0.0193). Corpulent rats consuming starch had a higher pancreatic iron concentration than all other experimental groups (p less than 0.05). The corpulent female rats were only mildly diabetic based upon serum and urine indices. The data suggest that the female SHR/N-corpulent rat may be a useful model for studying exocrine pancreatic function of mild cases of non-insulin-dependent diabetes.
