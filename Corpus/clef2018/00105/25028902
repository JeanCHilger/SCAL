Risk factors associated with the development of hyperamylasemia and post-ERCP pancreatitis in the Cuban National Institute. Acute pancreatitis is the most common complication in ERCP, and some risk factors were associated with the development of hyperamylasemia and post-ERCP pancreatitis.identifying new factors associated with the development of hyperamylasemia or post-ERCP pancreatitis in patients attended at our center.A (retrospective) cohort study was carried out in 170 patients on which a diagnostic-therapeutic ERCP was done due to biliopancreatic disease. 67 patients developed hyperamylasemia (39.4%) and 6 post-ERCP pancreatitis (3.5%). The following diagnostic criteria were applied: Hyperamylasemia: increase in the serum amylase level above the normal value (90 I/U). Acute post-ERCP pancreatitis: clinical: continuous abdominal pain for over 24 hours and biochemical: elevation of amylase3 times above normal value (90 U/I).The number of cannulations more than 4 (19 patients), (p=0.006 RR= 3.00) was associated significantly with the development of hyperamylasemia and the placing of biliary stent (14 patients), (p=0.00Technical factors were associated with the development of hyperamylasemia, however, the factors associated with the development of post-ERCP pancreatitis in our universe of study were related mainly with the patient.
