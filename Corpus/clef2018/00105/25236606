Pancreatic iron and fat assessment by MRI-R2* in patients with iron overload diseases. To determine the pancreatic iron (R2*) and fat content (FC) in comparison to hepatic and cardiac R2* in patients with iron overload disorders like β-thalassemia major (TM), Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) or hereditary hemochromatosis.R2* rates were assessed in the liver, heart and pancreas of 42 patients with TM, 29 subjects with other iron overload diseases, and 10 controls using an ECG-gated breathhold sequence (12 echo time [TE] = 1.3-25.7 ms, readout repetition time [TR] = 244 ms). Pancreatic R2* and FC were assessed from TE dependent region of interest based signal intensities performing water-fat chemical shift relaxometry and were compared with laboratory parameters (glucose, HbA1c, amylase and lipase).A pancreatic iron gradient from tail (R2* = 122 s(-1) ) to head (R2* = 114 s(-1) , P < 10(-4) ) was found. The close association between cardiac and pancreatic R2* was also confirmed in patients with TM and other iron overload diseases (rs  = 0.64, P < 10(-4) ). Receiver operator characteristic analysis (area: 0.89, P < 10(-4) ) identified patients with elevated cardiac iron at a pancreatic R2* cut-off level of 131s(-1) (sensitivity = specificity at 81%). Highest pancreatic R2* (211s(-1) ) and FC (36%) were found in the tail region of diabetic patients with TM.Pancreatic tail showed highest R2* rates and fat contents, especially in patients with thalassemia. Besides iron accumulation fatty degeneration might be an additional risk factor for the development of diabetes in β-thalassemia major, but this hypothesis needs further studies in prediabetic patients.
