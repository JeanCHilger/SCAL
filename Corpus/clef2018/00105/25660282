Risk factors of refeeding intolerance in mild acute interstitial pancreatitis: a retrospective study of 323 patients. This study was aimed to access the frequency and identify independent risk factors of refeeding intolerance in patients with mild acute interstitial pancreatitis.Patients with mild acute pancreatitis (AP) were included in this observational, descriptive, and retrospective study. Clinical variables, therapy-related variables, and biochemical and radiological variables were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analysis.Of 323 included cases, 40 patients (12.4%) developed refeeding intolerance. In the final regression model, hypertriglyceridemia-induced AP (odds ratio, 7.72 95% CI: 2.50-23.82, P < 0.001), elevated serum lipase (>2-fold of the upper limit of normal) before refeeding (odds ratio, 2.13Refeeding intolerance occurs in 12.4% patients with mild AP and appears more often in those with hypertriglyceridemia-induced AP, elevated serum lipase (>2-fold of the upper limit of normal) before refeeding, and immediate feeding.
