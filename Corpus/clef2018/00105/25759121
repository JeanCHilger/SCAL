Effect of gentiopicroside on experimental acute pancreatitis induced by retrograde injection of sodium taurocholate into the biliopancreatic duct in rats. Gentiopicroside (otherwise known as Gentiopicrin), one of the main active ingredients from the traditional Chinese herb medicine Gentiana manshurica Kitag, presents the effect of attenuating acute pancreatitis in rats. The experimental acute pancreatitis was made by retrograde injection of sodium taurocholate into the biliopancreatic duct in rats. Gentiopicroside was given orally and it markedly reduced the pancreatitis-evoked increase of serum amylase and lipase activity, decreased the pancreas mass/body mass index, tissue water content, TNF-α and IL-1β concentrations, and attenuated the histopathological changes and NF-κB p65 protein expression in pancreatic tissue. The results indicate that the function of gentiopicroside on acute pancreatitis may be related to inhibiting the release of inflammatory mediators and NF-κB p65 protein expression.
