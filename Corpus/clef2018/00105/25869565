Use of infliximab in treatment of acute pancreatitis. The aim of this study was to investigating the effects of infliximab in severe necrotizing pancreatitis.Forty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups evenly. Necrotizing pancreatitis was induced in group I and II by retrograde injection of 3% taurocholate into common pancreaticobiliary duct. In group III and IV saline was introduced instead of taurocholate to mimic pressure effect. Infliximab (8mg/kg) was infused through tail vein in group I and III and saline was infused in group II and IV just before laparotomy. Group V underwent sham laparotomy. Serum amylase activity, serum and tissue sialic acid, carbonyl content, malondialdehyde, total antioxidant activity (TAA) and pancreatic histopathology were assessed.In group I serum sialic acid, malondialdehyde, carbonyl content and amylase activity were significantly lower than in group II (p<0.01). There were no significant differences for serum TAA between group I and II (p>0.05). Tissue sialic acid and malondialdehyde in group I were significantly lower than in group II (p<0.01). But tissue TAA in group I was significantly higher than in group II (p<0.01). Carbonyl content of group I was not significantly different from group II (p>0.05). Histopathologically, pancreatic sections of group II demonstrated extensive acinar and fat necrosis, hemorrhage, and inflammation. In group I Infliximab improved histopathological changes (p0.05).Administration of infliximab resulted in a significant improvement in biochemical and histopathological alterations in acute necrotizing pancreatitis(Tab. 3, Ref. 43).
