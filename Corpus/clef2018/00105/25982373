Organ-specific monocyte activation in necrotizing pancreatitis in mice. Acute necrotizing pancreatitis (NAP) induces a systemic inflammatory response syndrome. We investigated the underlying changes of monocytes using different activation markers.A retrograde injection of 2 mL/kg bodyweight of sodium taurocholate into the common bile duct of BALB/c mice induced NAP, whereas sham-operated animals (SOP) were treated with saline. After 6, 12, 24, and 48 h, histologic alterations, pancreatic enzymes, and interleukin 6 in serum, albumin, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were examined. Isolation of mononuclear cells from the blood, spleen, and liver and the subsequent determination of macrophages (F4/80) and their activation marker CD121b and MHCII (1Ad) were performed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS analyses).After pancreatitis induction, pancreatic enzymes (amylase: SOP 7008 U/L, NAP 37,044 U/L, P < 0.001) and histologic pancreatic damage (SOP 0.80 ± 1.92, NAP 19.6 ± 0.64, P < 0.001) developed instantly. Pulmonary vascular damage and MPO were detected between 6 and 12 h after onset (6 h albumin SOP 132.0 ± 12.0 μg/mL, NAP 267.2 ± 49.6 μg/mL P < 0.05Although inflammatory mediators increased during 24 h after pancreatitis induction, monocyte activation lasted for at least 48 h. The latter is not limited to blood but also detected in isolated liver and spleen monocytes.
