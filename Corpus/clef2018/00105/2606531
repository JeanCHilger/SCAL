Acute pancreatitis and reduction of H+ ion concentration in gastric secretions in experimental acute myocarditis produced by Indian red scorpion, Buthus tamulus, venom. Crude venom (4 mg/kg) of scorpion (B. tamulus) was given in saline to anaesthetized dogs and rabbits. It produced a reduction in gastric H+ ion concentration in dogs with acute myocarditis. Simultaneously an increase in circulating amylase and lipase level was also observed. However 60% venom poisoned rabbits showed an elevated lipase level without a parallel increase in amylase. It is suggested that the venom acts directly on exocrine pancreas to cause acute pancreatitis.
