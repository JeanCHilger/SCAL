Association of claudin2 and PRSS1-PRSS2 polymorphisms with idiopathic recurrent acute and chronic pancreatitis: A case-control study from India. Gene polymorphisms, including those recently described in the claudin2 gene, have been implicated in recurrent acute (RAP) and chronic pancreatitis (CP). In India, RAP and CP have been associated with SPINK1 polymorphism. In this study, we evaluated the association of claudin2 and PRSS1-PRSS2 polymorphisms with idiopathic RAP and CP.We included 101 prospectively followed patients with documented idiopathic RAP (IRAP) and 96 patients who presented with idiopathic chronic pancreatitis (ICP) without previous history of AP. Controls were 156 unrelated individuals undergoing master health check or with non-specific symptoms. All the samples were genotyped for the SNPs rs7057398 in the claudin2 (CLDN2) gene and rs10273639 in the PRSS1 gene on Realtime polymerase chain reaction platform. Clinical data pertaining to patient and disease characteristics were recorded.Claudin2 and PRSS1 polymorphisms were seen in a significantly higher proportion of female patients (P = 0.01 and 0.039, respectively). Thirty-three (32.7%) patients with IRAP developed features of early CP during follow-up (mean [95% confidence interval, CI] duration of 11.3 [8.9-13.7] months). Female patients with claudin2 (rs7057398) CC genotype were at significantly higher risk for IRAP (odds ratio [OR] [95% CI] 6.75 [1.82-23.67] P = 0.004) and progression from IRAP to CP (OR [95% CI] 7.05 [1.51-33.01]In this study, we have demonstrated the association of claudin2 (rs7057398) polymorphism with IRAP and progression of IRAP to CP, and PRSS1 (rs10273639) polymorphism with IRAP and ICP.
