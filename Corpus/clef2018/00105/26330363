Efficacy of thymosin α1 and interferon α for the treatment of severe acute pancreatitis in a rat model. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of treatment with thymosin α1 (TA1) or interferon α (IFNα) following the establishment of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) in rats. A total of 144 Sprague‑Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups.

The three other groups were administered with 5% 1 ml/kg sodium taurocholate via the cholangiopancreatic duct. SAP group rats were administered with an intravenous injection of saline TA1 group rats received 26.7 µg/kg TA1
