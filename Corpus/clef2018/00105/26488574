Dachengqi Decoction Attenuates Inflammatory Response via Inhibiting HMGB1 Mediated NF-κB and P38 MAPK Signaling Pathways in Severe Acute Pancreatitis. Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) is a sudden inflammation of the pancreas. The traditional Chinese medicine formula Dachengqi decoction (DCQD) is proven to be beneficial in the comprehensive treatment for pancreatitis patients in clinical practice. However, the molecular mechanism of DCQD on SAP remains unclear. High mobility group box 1(HMGB1) that functions as a damage-associated molecular pattern molecule (DAMP) has attracted much interest.In this study, we used lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and cerulein to induce severe acute pancreatitis in C57BL/6 mice with subsequent administration with low, medium and high dose (2.3 g/kg, 7 g/kg and 21 g/kg, respectively) of DCQD.DCQD treatment improved the pathological score and decreased serum amylase and lipase in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, it suppressed the immune cell-induced secretion of HMGB1 and its translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, thus repressing the expression of IL-6 and TNF-α. Further, pretreatment with DCQD decreased responses of TLRs, and suppressed the activation of NF-κB and p38 MAPK pathway.Decreasing the secretion of HMGB1 could reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines, which may help cutting down the risks of development from localized pathological changes to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome and even lead to multiple organ failure.
