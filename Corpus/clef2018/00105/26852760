Evaluation of oxidant/anti-oxidants status in patients with mild acute -pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis (AP), an inflammatory disorder of the pancreas, is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The pathogenesis of AP has been suggested to -involve high oxidative stress (OS), combined with inadequate antioxidant status. We aimed to investigate the levels of serum total anti-oxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS) and ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) in patients with mild AP2016.Thirty subjects with mild AP and 29 healthy controls were enrolled into the study. The levels of TAS, TOS and IMA, C-reactive protein (CRP), high sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) and fibrinogen were measured in both groups.TAS levels were significantly lower (p = 0.037), while IMA levels were significantly higher (p < 0.001) in patients, compared to controls. TOS levels were similar between two groups. Fibrinogen, CRP and hs-CRP levels were significantly higher in patients than those of controls (p < 0.001 for all parameters). IMA levels were positively correlated with amylase and lipase levels (r = 0.448, p = 0.001 and r = 0.469, p < 0.001, respectively). There was a negative correlation between TAS levels, and amylase and lipase levels (r = -0.277, p = 0.035 and r = -0.278, p = 0.034, respectively).OS is reported to be associated with the inflammatory process and the severity of AP. In our study, among OS parameters, an increase in IMA levels and a decrease in TAS levels were observed in mild AP patients.
