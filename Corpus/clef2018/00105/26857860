Resistin: New serum marker for predicting severity of acute pancreatitis. To assess the effectiveness of resistin in predicting the severity of acute pancreatitis.Patients with acute pancreatitis who presented at the Gastroenterology Clinic, Erzurum Education and Research Hospital, Turkey were enrolled in this prospective study. White blood cell (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP) and resistin levels were measured on admission and at 24 h, day 3 and day 7 following admission, along with other blood parameters. Patients were divided into two groups: mild acute pancreatitis and moderate/severe acute pancreatitis.Of 59 patients with acute pancreatitis (mild, n = 37 moderate/severe, n = 22), significant between-group differences were found in terms of resistin and CRP levels. Receiver operating curve analysis showed that resistin levels were better for predicting severe cases of acute pancreatitis than CRP or WBC levels on day 3 (area under the curve [AUC], 0.88 versus 0.81 and 0.63, respectively). Resistin levels on day 3 were better than CRP levels for predicting necrosis development (AUC, 0.70 versus 0.69, respectively).Resistin may represent a new, effective indicator to predict the severity of acute pancreatitis and presence of necrosis in patients with acute pancreatitis.
