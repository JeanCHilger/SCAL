Therapeutic effects of ellagic acid on L-arginin ınduced acute pancreatitis. To investigate the therapeutic effects of ellagic acid on L-arginin ınduced acute pancreatitis in rats.Thirty-two were split into four groups. Group 1 (control) rats were performed only laparotomy, no drugs were administered. Group 2 (control+EA) rats were administered 85mg/kg EA orally. Rats were sacrificed by cardiac puncture 24 hours after the administration. Group3 (AP) 24 hours after intraperitoneal L-arginine administration, rats were sacrificed by cardiac puncture. Group 4 (EA)-(AP): 85mg/kg EA was administered orally after the L-arginine administration. 24 hours later, rats were sacrificed by cardiac puncture. Serum TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, total oxidative status (TOS), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), amylase levels were determined in all groups.Group 3 (AP) rats showed significantly raised TOS level as compared to Group1 (control) rats (p<0.001). Following the EA therapy, a decrease in TOS was observed in Group 4 (AP+EA). TAC levels were significantly raised in the Group 4 (AP+EA) compared to the Group 3 (AP) (p=0.003). Group 3 (AP) showed significantly increased TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 serum levels as compared to Group 4 (AP+EA). Histopathological changes were supported our result.The healing effects of ellagic acid on inflammatory and oxidative stress were confirmed by histopathological and biochemical evaluations of the pancreatic tissue.
