Protective effects of Salviae miltiorrhizae and anisodamine (654-2) against early lung injury in acute hemorrhagic necrotizing pancreatitis in the dog. Experimental study had been conducted on 18 healthy adult mongral dogs of both sex, weighting from 7.5-11 kg, randomly divided into four groups. Experimental models of acute hemorrhagic necrotizing pancreatitis (AHNP) were established by retrograde injecting 1 ml/kg of sodium taurocholate directly into the pancreatic duct. The dogs were treated respectively with intravenous infusion of Salviae miltiorrhizae (5 g/kg), 654-2(5 mg/kg) or normal saline. The results showed that PaO2, PaCO2 and pH did not change in early stage of AHNP. The contents of lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH), albumin and lipid peroxide (LPO) of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in the AHNP group were significantly higher than that of Salviae miltiorrhizae group (P less than 0.05). The necrosis and disruption of conjunction of endothelial cells resulting from the defects of vascular wall were noted under transmission electron microscope. Both pulmonary vascular and type II pneumocyte were normal in the Salviae miltiorrhizae group. These results suggested that Salviae miltiorrhizae possess the effect of protecting endothelial cells of pulmonary vascular and type II pneumocyte, which could function as scavenger of oxygen-derived free radicals.
