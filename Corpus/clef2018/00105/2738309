Effects of trypsin inhibitor (camostate) on pancreas and CCK release in young and old female rats. Differences in pancreatic responses and CCK release to intragastric administration of a synthetic protease inhibitor (camostate) were examined in young (6-mo) and old (26-mo) female rats. When rats were sacrificed 1 hour after camostate administration (100 mg/kg), plasma CCK concentration significantly increased in both age groups and was significantly higher in young rats than in the old. Acute pancreatic responses to camostate were attenuated in old rats, compared with the young. On the other hand, 5-day administration of camostate (100 mg/kg, twice a day) increased pancreatic wet weight, chymotrypsin concentration and content in pancreas in both age groups, whereas lipase content did not increase in old rats although it significantly increased in young rats. Plasma CCK concentrations were not significantly different between young and old rats. It is concluded that the acute response of CCK release to camostate is attenuated in old rats, but the capability of chronic pancreatic adaptation of chymotrypsin content to camostate is well maintained in old rats.
