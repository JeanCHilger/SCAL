Diabetic hyperlipemia with or without acute pancreatitis in patients with chronic alcoholism. A study of 4 cases. Diabetic lipemia with and without acute pancreatitis in chronic alcoholism. A report of 4 cases. Diabetic lipemia was observed in 4 chronic alcoholic men after ingestion of high doses of alcohol and/or sugar-rich beverages, including one patient who was treated for insulin-dependent diabetes. None had a previous history of serum lipid disturbances. All had marked hyperglycemia, hyperosmolality and hypertriglyceridemia (mean: 60.8 mmol/l), 2 of undetermined type and 2 of type IV with eruptive xanthomas. Factitious hyponatremia was present in 3 cases, but true serum sodium was normal (138 mmol/l) or elevated (154, 156, 182 mmol/l) after correction. Three patients developed acute pancreatitis ascribed to high serum triglyceride levels and/or to alcohol ingestion. Serum and urine amylase activity was inhibited by hypertriglyceridemia. The diagnosis of pancreatitis was assessed twice by echography and computed tomographic scan, and once by tomographic scan and an elevation of the amylase on creatinine clearance ratio. It is likely that hypertriglyceridemia predisposed these patients to develop pancreatitis, alcoholism being a precipitating factor. We suggest that the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis should be systematically considered in any case of diabetic lipemia without true hyponatremia.
