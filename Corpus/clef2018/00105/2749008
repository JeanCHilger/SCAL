Does bile play a fundamental role in inducing and influencing acute reflux pancreatitis in rat? Acute pancreatitis by closed duodenal loop in two groups of rats, with or without biliary diversion, was induced to ascertain any role that bile might have in codetermining and influencing the disease. Both the histological findings and the serum amylase levels showed the presence of mild acute pancreatitis in both groups. The histological and/or biochemical findings and the survival rates were similar for rats with and rats without biliary diversion. We may therefore conclude that the closed duodenal loop causes acute pancreatitis of a mild degree in the rat bile did not appear to play a fundamental role in inducing or in influencing the outcome of the acute pancreatic inflammation in this experimental model.
