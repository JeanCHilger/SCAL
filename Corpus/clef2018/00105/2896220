Transient elevation of serum bile acids during acute pancreatitis. An increase of serum bile acids was detected in patients with biliary acute pancreatitis who could be investigated during the first 24 hours after the onset of the acute phenomena. Serum bile acids levels, as well as alpha-amylase activity, however rapidly decreased and were found within normal limits after 48-72 h, while the increased serum gamma-glutamyltransferase activity persisted for at least 7 days. Changes affecting serum bile acids in patients with acute pancreatitis unassociated to biliary disease or in patients with acute biliary disease unaccompanied by a pancreatic reaction were less important. Mechanisms leading to these changes and their possible pathogenic relevance are briefly discussed.
