Pancreatitis and renal disease. Pancreatitis has been described previously following renal transplantation, but not in association with chronic renal failure. Analysis of 168 patients with renal transplants revealed five who developed pancreatitis, three of whom died. All five were on treatment with prednisone and azathioprine. Four patients were seen with definite attacks of pancreatitis and chronic, stable renal failure from a variety of causes. None had received immunosuppressive agents, prednisone nor thiazide diuretics, but two were on regular frusemide. One patient was on maintenance dialysis, which could not be related directly to the pancreatitis. In either group alcohol ingestion, cholethiathiasis, or hypercalcaemia was not a factor. This diagnosis of pancreatitis was established on clinical grounds and serum amylast levels of greater than 900 iu/1. Similar serum amylast elevation was not found ina random group of patients with chronic renal failure. Hyperlipidaemia was not present in any patient with pancreatitis. Although hypercalcaemia and primary hyperparathyroidism was not found in the transplant and non-transplant subjects, elevated serum parathormone levels have been described in uraemic patients with normocalcaemia. Hyperparathyroidism may be a factor in the development of pancreatitis in reanl failure. Pancreatitis carries a significant mortality risk in renal transplantation. The four non-transplanted patients have survived, despite recurrent attacks of pancreatitis.
