Fine needle biopsy of the pancreas with computerized tomography control. The results of 96 computed tomography guided percutaneous pancreatic aspiration biopsies were reviewed and compared with the findings at laparotomy or autopsy or with a follow-up of at least one year. In only four instances the follow-up was inadequate and in 29 cases the specimen did not allow a cytologic or histologic diagnosis. Of the remaining 67 biopsies 65 were diagnosed correctly and only 2 incorrectly. This corresponds to a sensitivity of 67.7% and a specificity of 97%. In patients with primary pancreatic cancer the figures for sensitivity or specificity are 76.8% and 97.3% respectively. We did not observe any serious complications. Only one patient had a transient rise of the serum amylase. We believe that the percutaneous aspiration biopsy of the pancreas guided by computed tomography is a safe and effective method in the histologic and cytologic diagnosis of pancreatic lesions.
