C-reactive protein (CRP) and pancreatic necrosis in acute necrotising pancreatitis. C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured on the operation day in 35 patients with acute necrotising pancreatitis. In this prospective study the CRP level differentiated with high significance (p less than 0.001) the patients with extensive pancreatic necrosis from the patients with limited pancreatic necrosis. A marked variation in CRP production was demonstrated in both groups. Therefore in individual cases CRP alone is not a reliable predictor of pancreatic necrosis.
