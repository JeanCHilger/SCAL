Fat macroglobule formation from chylomicrons and non-traumatic fat embolism. Chylomicrons show calcium-dependent agglutination by C-reactive protein (CRP). This has been suggested as a mechanism by which fat embolism may occur in the absence of trauma. It may also play a role in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis in patients with types I and V hyperlipidaemia.
