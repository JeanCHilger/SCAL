Sphincteroplasty: its value in the treatment of distal lithiasis of the choledochus. Twenty patients in whom sphincteroplasty was performed are presented. In 12 cases the indication was choledocholithiasis with stone impacted in the distal bile duct 5 cases with choledocholithiasis and oddian stenosis, and 3 cases with residual choledocholithiasis associated with oddian stenosis. The average length of the incision of the ampullary area was 25 mm. The postoperative control made by tube cholangiography evidenced the presence of a wide open choledochoduodenal opening. Amylase activity was followed in all patients. One case of acute pancreatitis and one case of choledochal fistula were recorded as postoperative complications.
