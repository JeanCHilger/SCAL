The enzymatic studies of the liver in acute experimental pancreatitis in dogs treated with prostacyclin (PGI2). The liver affection in acute experimental pancreatitis (AEP) could be reflected by changes of enzymatic activity in the liver and in serum. The histoenzymatic studies of the liver of dogs with AEP of different severity and time of duration induced according to Elliott's method were performed and the constellation of serum enzymatic activities considering treatment with prostacyclin was estimated. The histoenzymatic reactions on succinic dehydrogenase, lactic dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase were depressed with progression of time and severity of AEP. In contrast, the reaction on acid phosphatase was augmented at the same time. Serum AspAT, AlAT and alkaline phosphatase were augmented in the later phase of AEP, but acid phosphatase and beta-glucuronidase were not significantly changed. The treatment with PGI2 limited both histoenzymatic reactions and alterations of serum enzymatic activities. These results support the significance of changes in enzymatic activities in the course of liver reaction on pancreatogenic noxa during acute pancreatitis, and suggest the protective effect of PGI2 against liver injury in this disease.
