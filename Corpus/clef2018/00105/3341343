Cutaneous pseudo abscesses: an unusual presentation of severe pancreatitis. In this report, we present a 53-yr-old man with extensive subcutaneous fat necrosis due to acute pancreatitis presenting as fluctuant collections resembling large multiple abscesses. The diagnosis was suggested by examination of the wound aspirate. Findings included absence of organisms on the gram stain, presence of fat globules on wet mount, and an elevated amylase in the wound aspirate. This dramatic presentation preceded any symptoms or signs of overt pancreatitis.
