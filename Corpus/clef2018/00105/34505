Continuous peritoneal dialysis as treatment of acute experimental pancreatitis in the rat. II. Analysis of its beneficial effect. In acute sodium-taurocholate-induced pancreatitis in the rat, peritoneal dialysis reduced serum amylase levels and the amount of fat necrosis, but did not influence the damage to the pancreas itself. Pancreatic ascites obtained in the early course of the disease was found to have a hypotensive effect when given intraperitoneally to healthy rats. This effect vanished in the later course of acute experimental pancreatitis and was reduced by acidification of the ascites or by administration of an antihistaminic drug. Thus the beneficial effect of continuous peritoneal dialysis on survival time and mortality rate seems to be of systemic origin.
