Autologous heterotopic partial transplantation of the pancreas in the dogs with reference to different drainage methods. Pancreatic autotransplantation is a necessary requirement for studies on the technical aspects of pancreatic grafting. In the allograft model immunological problems influences the graft survival. In 25 mongrel dogs the left limb of the pancreas was transplanted into the grain with end to side vascular anastomosis. The body and right limb of the pancreas was removed and discarded. We have compared various technique for management the exocrine pancreas section (Neoprene-injected duct open duct technique). Currently the rate of complications in segmental pancreas autotransplantation was high especially in Neoprene injected dogs. Reasons for this result from technical failures like venous thrombosis and pancreatitis. In every case it was possible to ameliorate the diabetes mellitus up to the 7th day. Histological we found dilated interlobe space up to 7 days after transplantation with open ducts and there were no signs of disturbance in the endocrine tissue. In the Neoprene-injected group we found a severe intraacinous oedema and 5 days after transplantation already a beginning fibrosis with destroyed islets of Langerhans.
