Enteral feedback control of pancreatic hypertrophy: the role of pancreatic biliary secretions. Chronic diversion of pancreatic and biliary secretions away from the proximal small intestine resulted in rapid increases in pancreatic size and protein content in adult rats. The effect was detectable as early as 10 days postsurgery. Differential changes in pancreatic enzymes were evident after bypass. The concentration of trypsinogen remained stable while amylase concentrations showed a marked decrease. Total pancreatic trypsinogen content, however, was increased, while amylase content remained similar to controls. Feeding bypassed rats with chows containing various pancreatic and biliary supplements had no effect on the hyperplastic response of their pancreata. Trypsinogen and amylase levels in supplemented groups remained similar to the bypassed group fed nonsupplemented chow, with the exception of increases in trypsinogen concentration and content in the groups supplemented with bile and cotazyme plus bile acids. The adequacy of oral refeeding of pancreatic biliary components was supported by its effectiveness in restoring mucosal enterokinase activity and trypsin levels in segment 1. However, there was no correlation between tryptic activity in the contents of the bypassed segment and the eventual pancreatic weight. These results indicate that factors other than those supplemented in this study are required in maintaining the steady state of pancreatic growth in normal rats.
