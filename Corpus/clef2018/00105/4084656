Minor graft-versus-host reaction: very early effects on hepatic and exocrine pancreatic functions in mice. The alterations of aspartate aminotransferase (GOT), lipase, alpha-amylase, glucose, urea and bilirubin plasma levels, as well as body weight and electrocardiogram tracings were monitored in individual mice, as organ dysfunction tests, throughout a graft-versus-host reaction (GVHR) induced by minor non-H-2 histocompatibility antigens. Starting in the first two weeks, elevations of GOT and decreases of alpha-amylase and lipase were found indicating deterioration of liver and exocrine pancreatic function.
