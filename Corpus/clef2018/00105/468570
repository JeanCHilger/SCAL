Acute pancreatitis in animal experiments - a new method. Acute pancreatitis was induced in 30 minipigs (GÃ¶ttingen) by implantation of a T-drain into the Ductus Wirsungianus. The distal part of the T-drain, which led into the duodenum was stenosed to 1/3 of the original diameter. The inflammation was caused by stenosis of the Ductus Wirsungianus additionally by application of contrast medium. The course of the inflammation was demonstrated by biochemical, roentgenological and histological examinations.
