The effect of ethanol ingestion on plasma biochemistry and the pancreas in the rat. Intra-gastric ethanol given daily for 4 weeks caused transient elevations in plasma amylase and total protein with a fall in total calcium. Light microscopic examination of the pancreas at 4 weeks showed areas of acinar cell degranulation and necrosis without an inflammatory cell infiltrate. The pancreatic changes are unlikely to be an artefact, but rather a direct toxic effect of the alcohol as confirmed by the biochemical changes.
