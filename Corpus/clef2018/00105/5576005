Possible use of glucagon in the treatment of pancreatitis. Four patients with pancreatic disease received glucagon intravenously. In two a definite decrease in the volume of pancreatic exocrine secretion was shown, and in one of these pancreatic juice protein and bicarbonate levels also fell. Two patients with acute pancreatitis had pronounced relief of epigastric pain associated with falls in plasma amylase after intravenous glucagon.Several mechanisms could account for the possible beneficial effect of glucagon in pancreatitis, and further studies of its use in this disease are justified.
