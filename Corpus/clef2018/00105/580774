Behavior of blood amylase and plasma deoxyribonuclease I in dogs subjected to intra-operative cholangiography with the use of B 10610. An experimental study was conducted on the use of a new iodate-molecule, B 10610, synthesized in the Bracco research Laboratory, for intra-operative cholangiographic diagnostics. For the purpose of evaluating the possible rise and the extent of any pancreatic damage in animals subjected to intra-operative radiological exploration of the biliary ducts with the use of the said substance, the blood levels of amylase and plasmatic 1st deoxyribonuclease were assayed after various time intervals, such tests being particularly specific in the humoral diagnostics of both acute and chronic pancreatic diseases. On the basis of the tests made, it is concluded that the introduction of this new dye does not cause irreversible lesions of the pancreas, but only purely functional and transient alterations.
