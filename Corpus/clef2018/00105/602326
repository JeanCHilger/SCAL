A controlled trial of glucagon in acute experimental pancreatitis in rats. Acute pancreatitis was induced in 245 rats by retrograde instillation of Na-taurocholate into the pancreatic duct. Mortality rate in animals treated 6-hourly with glucagon (1 mg/kg) after induction of pancreatitis was 50% as compared to 30% deaths in the controls treated with 0,9% NaCl (chi2-test: p less than 0,05). Mortality rate in animals treated 6-hourly with the same dose of glucagon before induction of pancreatitis was 36,5% as compared to 28% deaths in the corresponding controls (chi2-test: p greater than 0,05). Glucagon in lower doses (0,1-0,5 mg/kg every 6 hours) did not alter mortality rates as compared to animals treated with 0,9% NaCl. 2. A nonletal form of pancreatitis was induced in 26 rats by ligation of the pancreatic duct. Injection of glucagon (1 mg/kg) seemed to suppress amylase activities in blood for a short period of appr. 1 hour. However, 7 and 9 hours after induction of pancreatitis, amylase activities were significantly higher in animals treated one or two times with glucagon as compared to untreated controls. It is concluded that glucagon in the high dose of 1-4 mg/kg/24 hours does not only not influence the course of acute experimental pancreatitis in rats but can even deteriorate it.
