Acute renal failure in acute pancreatitis. Nine patients who developed acute renal failure in the course of acute pancreatitis are described. All patients developed acute renal failure in the absence of hypotension. Acute renal failure developed within 24 to 72 hours after admission. They were treated conservatively except for one, who was treated with peritoneal dialysis. The duration of the oliguric phase of acute renal failure subsided between 4 to 14 days, and all patients recovered from both acute pancreatitis and acute renal failure.
