Protective effects of PGE2 on diet-induced acute pancreatitis in mice. Prostaglandins have been noted to have a "protective" effect against gastrointestinal mucosal injury induced by a wide variety of agents although possible protective effects of prostaglandins on injury to other tissues have not been reported. We have tested the effect of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) on acute experimental pancreatitis induced by feeding young female mice a choline-deficient ethionine-supplemented (CDE) diet for 24 hr. Administration of 0.05--0.20 microgram PGE2/g body wt 1 hr before and 4 hr after institution of the CDE diet lowered the mortality rate of diet-induced pancreatitis from 56% to 31%. Larger and smaller doses of PGE2 were without effect. Administration of PGE2 (0.10 microgram/g body weight) diminished the rise in in-vitro LDH discharge and the increase in "free" Cathepsin D activity which occur during diet-induced pancreatitis. Similarly, PGE2 (0.10 microgram/g body wt) diminished the magnitude of the increase in in-vitro protein discharge and the elevated concentrations of trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen in pancreas fragments taken from mice given the CDE diet. These findings indicate the PGE2 has a protective effect against CDE diet-induced acute experimental pancreatitis. The Cathespin D and LDH changes noted during CDE diet-induced pancreatitis suggest that this diet may decrease membrane integrity and thus allow these enzymes to leak out of the lysosomes and acinar cell, respectively, during pancreatitis. Although the basis for the protective effect of PGE2 remains unclear, our observations suggest that the prostaglandin may act to reduce the alteration in membrane integrity which occurs during CDE-diet induced pancreatitis.
