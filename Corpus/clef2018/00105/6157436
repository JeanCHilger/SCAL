Effect of 5-fluorouracil on the enzymatic activity of the pancreas and blood serum of rats with acute pancreatitis. The effect of 5-fluorouracil on the activity of pancreatic enzymes was studied in rats with acute pancreatitis. 5-Fluorouracil was injected intraperitoneally in a dose of 4.5 mg per 100 g body weight. Pancreatic transaminidase as well as serum alpha-amylase and trypsin levels decreased starting from 3--6h after the induction of acute pancreatitis. 5-Fluorouracil inhibited RNA and DNA synthesis and blocked the synthesis of pancreatic enzymes.
