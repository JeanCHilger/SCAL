Response of rat exocrine pancreas to chronic pulmonary ethanol intoxication. Rats were intoxicated over a 32-day period by continuous exposure to an ethanol-enriched atmosphere. Under these conditions, body weights increased up to day 26 and blood ethanol levels increased to approximately 2 g/liter. Pancreatic and hepatic histologies were normal. Amylase levels and total pancreatic protein decreased, while lipase levels rose. These changes appear to be independent of the caloric balance of the diet.
