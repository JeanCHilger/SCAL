A study of the specificity of amylases. Measurement of pancreatic isoamylases (author's transl). Serum lipase, pancreatic isoamylases and serum inhibitory activity on proteases were measured in 29 patients, 17 of whom had pancreatic disorders. The new test used to measure pancreatic isoamylases is rapid and useful, as it is relatively specific of pancreatic lesions. In acute abdominal syndromes, it undoubtedly enhances the value of biochemical investigations by confirming or excluding pancreatic lesions or involvement.
