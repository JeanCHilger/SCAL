Transient ECG changes during acute attacks of pancreatitis. Information on the prevalence of ECG abnormalities in patients with acute pancreatitis together with pertinent simultaneous laboratory data have been missing. This prospective study was undertaken in order to clarify these points. 54 patients with 72 acute attacks of pancreatitis were examined. 31 patients (57%) had transient ECG abnormalities. The ECG changes consisted mainly of unspecific T-wave changes (25 cases) and accelerated atrial or nodal rhythms (8 cases). The ECG changes were more common in patients with biliary etiology (80%) than in patients with alcoholic etiology (49%), probably partly due to the higher age of the patients with biliary disease. The laboratory data did not give any clue to the cause of the ECG changes. The authors believe that the ECG changes may be due to underlying ischemic heart disease unmasked by the stress of acute pancreatitis, and/or imbalance of the autonomous nervous system.
