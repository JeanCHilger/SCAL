Gallstone associated with acute pancreatitis in a child. The authors report a case of acute pancreatitis and cholelithiasis in a 13-year-old boy. During the clinical course of the disease temporary cholestatic jaundice appeared with pleural effusion and with biochemical relapse after the beginning of oral nutrition. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis and associated gallstone was established by clinical and laboratory findings. The authors emphasize the diagnostic importance of the plain abdominal film and of elevated renal amylase clearance. As the etiologic diagnosis was clear, cholecystectomy was postponed until the laboratory findings proved the recovery of the patient.
