Pancreatic exocrine function after truncal and highly selective vagotomy. We have measured plasma glucose and immunoreactive trypsin concentrations and serum pancreatic amylase activities in single blood samples following truncal vagotomy (TV) in 13 patients and highly selective vagotomy (HSV) in 14 patients. Our results show that an increased incidence of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency occurs postoperatively regardless of the type of vagotomy. Glucose concentrations were significantly higher after TV, suggesting that HSV is preferable for patients at risk of or suffering from diabetes mellitus.
