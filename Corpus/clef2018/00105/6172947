Correlation of the clearance of amylase and creatinine in acute pancreatitis and other pathologies. The study of a group of 151 patients confirms the diagnostic value of elevated ACCR in pancreatitis, it was positive in 89.4% of them, of the group, 30 were normal, 19 exhibited acute pancreatitis and 102 had various other pathologies. Serious pancreatitis has shown coincide with a long-lasting rise of ACCR, and its rise in the course of the disease was a sign of a new outburst of progressive necrosis. Total unreliability when abnormal creatinine clearance is present was ascertained. The possible mechanism of increase in ACCR has been considered also in connection with the study of the results obtained on a group of patients exhibiting renal insufficiency, gastrointestinal bleeding, acute colecystitis, vesicular lithiasis and obstructive jaundice.
