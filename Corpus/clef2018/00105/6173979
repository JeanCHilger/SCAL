Peritoneal lavage in acute pancreatitis. An experimental and clinical study. Experiments were performed to evaluate the use of peritoneal lavage in dogs, in which an acute non fatal necrotic-hemorrhagic pancreatitis was obtained by means of intraductal sodium-taurocholate injection. A single lavage of 2 liters of a balanced solution 6 hours after the pancreatitis onset produced a temporary biochemical improvement, as evidenced by the amylase, lipase and alcaline phosphatase values. Triple lavage with or without heparin, performed after 6, 18 and 24 hours, produced on the other hand clearcut reduction in mortality rates and long lasting improvement of the biochemical parameters. Two patients with operatively confirmed necrotic hemorrhagic pancreatitis were treated by the lavage method during three days. The treatment resulted in a significant improvement of the clinical condition and the biochemical parameters of both patients.
