Effect of gordox on the pancreas in experimental pancreonecrosis. Early treatment with gordox of white rats with experimental pancreonecrosis reduces amylasemia and prevents dissemination of steatonecroses. The drug appreciably improves pancreatic microcirculation. Similarly to the control, the injured part of the gland undergoes necrosis. However, the severity of hemorrhagic component is minimal. The treatment with gordox enhances leukocytic infiltration aimed at elimination of necrotic tissues.
