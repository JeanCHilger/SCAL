Foregut mucosal defects: an etiology of hyperamylasemia. To evaluate a preliminary correlation of hyperamylasemia to upper gastrointestinal bleeding, total serum amylase and serum isoamylase profiles were determined in 50 patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Etiologies of the bleeding were determined in 46 patients including gastritis or duodenitis in 25, gastric ulcers in 12, duodenal ulcers in 3, Mallory-Weiss tears in 3, gastric carcinoma in 2, and esophageal varices in 1. Gastritis or duodenitis was seen incidentally in 14 more patients. Hyperamylasemia was seen in 38 patients, most commonly being due to a rise of both nonpancreatic and pancreatic isoamylases (18 patients). In 13 patients it was due to an elevation of nonpancreatic amylase alone, and in 7 patients secondary to elevated pancreatic isoamylase alone. Acute pancreatitis raises only the pancreatic component and cannot explain the hyperamylasemia in most of these patients. Hyperamylasemia did not correlate to etiology of the bleeding gastritis or duodenitis present in the majority of these patients appears to be the unifying factor. Since both nonpancreatic and pancreatic amylases are present in the duodenum and the stomach with pyloric reflux, reabsorption of intraluminal amylase across damaged mucosa is postulated as a mechanism to explain the observed isoamylase patterns. The possibility of decreased amylase clearance as an explanation is unlikely. An alternative central nervous system mechanism might be invoked. It is concluded that hyperamylasemia is a complex event which the use of isoamylase analysis is beginning to elucidate. The hyperamylasemia seen commonly in patients presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding does not imply the presence of acute pancreatitis.
