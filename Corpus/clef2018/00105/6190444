Pancreas divisum: is it a surgical disease? Six patients with the congenital anomaly, pancreas divisum, and recurrent acute pancreatitis were treated surgically. The diagnostic triad of multiple episodes of abdominal pain with elevated serum amylase and identification of the anomaly by ERCP was present uniformly. Sphincteroplasty of the ampulla of Vater and ductoplasty of the accessory papilla were performed in five patients. One patient had sphincteroplasty only due to failure to identify the accessory duct. Two patients eventually required major pancreatic resection for pain relief. Three additional patients were identified and managed nonoperatively. Data of 44 patients with surgically treated pancreas divisum have been collected from the literature. Review of these patients indicates that dual sphincteroplasty or dorsal ductoplasty are the two most frequently employed procedures and appear to give good results.
