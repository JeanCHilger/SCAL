The effect of glucagon on urine amylase in various animal species. Glucagon effects on the kidney include increased water, creatinine, and amylase clearance. We have compared these effects in several laboratory animal species. Although every species responded to glucagon, 1 mg iv, by some alteration in renal function there were differences in the degree and direction of the changes. Glucagon caused an increase in amylase clearance in four of the six species studied and an increase in creatinine clearance in four. An increase in urine flow tended to occur in all species. An increased amylase clearance is a feature of acute pancreatitis, and raised glucagon levels have been found during attacks. It is possible that the two are causally related. In the experimental situation, timing of urine collections and species differences were found to be of critical importance in exploring this possibility.
