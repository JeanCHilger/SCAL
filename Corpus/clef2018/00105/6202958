Comparative study of protease inhibitors on coagulation abnormalities in canine pancreatitis. Coagulation abnormalities induced by pancreatitis were studied in 36 dogs. The 12 dogs in group I underwent a duodenotomy alone. The six dogs in groups II, III, IV, and V had pancreatitis induced by bile injection (1 cc/kg) into the pancreatic duct. Twenty minutes after bile-induced pancreatitis, group III was given 1.0 mg/kg aprotinin (trasylol), group IV was given 10 mg/kg S-2441, a new synthetic protease inhibitor, and group V was given 0.5 mg/kg alpha 2-antitrypsin by intravenous infusion over 10 min. Blood was drawn for amylase, protime (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), fibrinogen, and platelets, in addition to markers of hypercoagulation, fibrinopeptide A, and antithrombin III, and markers of fibrinolysis, B beta 15-42 immunoreactive peptide (IP), and alpha 2-antiplasmin at baseline, 1/2, 1, 3, 6, 24, 48, and 72 hr after duodenotomy or bile injection. There was no significant difference in PT, platelets, antithrombin III, and fibrinopeptide A among the five groups. With the induction of pancreatitis (group II), serum amylase was significantly elevated but fibrinogen only became elevated at 24 hr and PTT at 48 hr. The increase in B beta 15-42 IP seen 30 min after induction of pancreatitis and the decrease in alpha 2-antiplasmin were blunted by aprotinin, alpha 1-antitrypsin, and S-2441, but inhibition of the rise in amylase and B beta 15-42 IP only reached significance with S-2441 (P less than 0.05). Pancreatitis-induced fibrinolysis was inhibited by S-2441 suggesting that synthetic protease inhibitors may play a therapeutic role in pancreatitis.
