Santorini's Duct--an insignificant variant from normal or an important overflow valve? In a retrospective examination 250 consecutive pancreatograms obtained by ERCP were controlled on the existence of a D. Snatorini. Starting from the genetic development of the pancreatic ducts the question is investigated whether a second open pancreatic duct is responsible for a better drainage of the pancreas. Thus this duct may prevent hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia following ERCP. From an etiological point of view the elevation of these pancreatic enzymes is insufficiently understandable. If a D. Santorini is detectable the results demonstrate a reduction of the increased pancreatic enzymes in a statistically significant manner. A valve mechanism of the D. pancreaticus minor with volume or pressure reduction is postulated.
