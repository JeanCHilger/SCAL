A method for determination of immunoreactive trypsin in complex with alpha 1-antitrypsin in human sera. A double antibody solid phase radioimmunoassay for the determination of cationic trypsin in complex with alpha 1-antitrypsin in human sera is described. No immunoreactive trypsin in complex with alpha 1-antitrypsin can be detected in normal sera. In sera from 8 patients with acute pancreatitis levels between 100 and 1000 micrograms/l are seen. The amount of trypsin in complex with alpha 1-antitrypsin in serum in acute pancreatitis equals or exceeds the amount of trypsinogen. Serum levels of trypsin in complex with alpha 1-antitrypsin also remain elevated longer than the trypsinogen levels in acute pancreatitis.
