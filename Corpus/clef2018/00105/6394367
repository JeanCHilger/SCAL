Physiological and biochemical characteristics of changes in pancreatic secretory activity during the development of atrophy in dogs. In pancreatic atrophy the normal digestive dynamics of pancreatic juice volume, concentrations and outputs of proteolytic enzymes, alpha-amylase and bicarbonate are disturbed. The changes of enzymic dynamics are revealed before those of pancreatic juice volume and bicarbonate concentration. The subcutaneous injections of boiled pancreatic juice didn't restore dynamics of indices studied but maintained their levels during the more prolonged period.
