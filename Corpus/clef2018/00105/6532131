The effect of 5-fluorouracil on experimental acute pancreatitis. The present study was undertaken to elucidate the effects of different doses of 5-fluorouracil on experimental acute pancreatitis. Twelve mongrel dogs were used. Acute pancreatitis was induced by intraductal injection of sunflower-oil. Two groups of animals were treated with intravenous 5-fluorouracil: 1 mg/kg body weight for the first group of 5 animals, and 5 mg/kg body weight for the second one of 7 animals in subsequent three postoperative days. All the animals in the first group died within 24 to 36 hours due to acute haemorrhagic pancreatitis. All the animals in the second one survived longer than 36 hours. A statistically significant increase of serum amylase and lipase levels was found in pancreatitis with significant decrease of them during treatment. Three to 8 weeks later signs of chronic pancreatitis could be detected in surviving dogs.
