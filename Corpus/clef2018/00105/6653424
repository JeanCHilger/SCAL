Diagnostic value of lipase and isoamylase determination. Monitoring studies in patients with proven and suspected pancreatitis. Changes of lipase (turbidimetric evaluation), total amylase and isoamylases (inhibition test) were determined in 93 patients with proven or suspect pancreatitis. In 35 patients with established acute pancreatitis 143 sera were investigated in the course of disease. Lipase and pancreatic amylase were increased in these samples significantly more often (thus longer in the course of disease) than total amylase. Eight patients with chronic pancreatitis and exocrine insufficiency showed very low lipase and pancreatic amylase activities whereas total amylase was normal. Observations in the course of two groups of patients with suspect (but not established) pancreatitis showed superior organ specificity of lipase and pancreatic amylase when compared to total amylase. However, no relevant difference of the diagnostic validity of both enzymes could be demonstrated.
