Investigations into various pancreatic enzymes. The effects of several pancreatic enzymes on living tissue incapable of autodigestion were studied to analyse elements of the "pluralistic events of acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis" (Becker 1981). Phospholipase A2 induces (via toxic lysolecithin) cytotoxic necrosis in the testis elastase (via destruction of vessels and local ischemia) causes hypoxic necrosis. Injection of lipase does not result in necrosis.
