Progressive atrophy of pancreatic acinar tissue in rats fed a copper-deficient diet supplemented with D-penicillamine or triethylene tetramine: morphological and physiological studies. This paper describes the progressive effects of severe copper depletion on pancreatic weight, structure, amylase content and responses to secretin and caerulein, as well as a number of general body parameters (appearance, body weight and blood indices). Copper depletion was produced by feeding young rats a copper-deficient diet alone or together with either of the two chelating agents D-penicillamine or triethylene tetramine (Trien). After 6 weeks, the copper-deficient diet alone had relatively little effect on general body parameters but reduced gland weight and the secretory response to caerulein. Addition of D-penicillamine ductal and islet tissue relatively intact gland weight was markedly reduced, and gland amylase was reduced virtually to zero
