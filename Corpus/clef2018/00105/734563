Exocrine pancreatic function in patients with idiopathic necrosis of the femoral head. Exocrine pancreatic function after secretin and cholecystokinin stimulation was examined in a group of patients with idiopathic necrosis of the femoral head and in a normal control group. The volume output, bicarbonate and amylase concentrations in the patient group were not significantly lower than in the control group. Taken individually, however, 3 out of 8 patients with idiopathic necrosis of the femoral head had abnormal pancreatic function tests. In 4 patients there was a significant alcohol intake, with a history suggestive of acute pancreatitis in 2. This suggests that in some patients chronic pancreatitis may be a factor in the pathogenesis of idiopathic necrosis of the femoral head.
