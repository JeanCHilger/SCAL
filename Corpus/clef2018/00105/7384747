Studies of pure pancreatic secretions in chronic alcoholic subjects without pancreatic insufficiency. To determine the role alcohol might play in altering pancreatic function, we have examined pure pancreatic juice, obtained by endoscopic cannulation of the pancreatic duct, from a group of 10 chronic alcoholic subjects without history or clinical or laboratory evidence of pancreatic disease and compared the results with those obtained from 15 healthy, non-alcoholic subjects. These findings confirm observations in experimental animals made by others and support the hypothesis that chronic alcohol abuse may damage the pancreas via a sequence of events involving protein hypersecretion. Increase in concentration was not uniform for all proteins measured. Unexpectedly, chronic alcoholics exhibited a highly significant elevation (two- to three-fold over normal) in trypsinogen, in contrast to statistically insignificant increases of other zymogens and trypsin inhibitor. The strikingly increased ratio of trypsinogen to trypsin inhibitor observed in all our alcoholic patients may indicate a weakening of the defence mechanism provided by the trypsin inhibitor against premature intraductal activation of zymogens and explain the predisposition of these patients to pancreatitis.
