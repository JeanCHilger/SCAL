Acute hemorrhagic pancreatic necrosis in mice. Alterations of pancreatic lipase activity, pancreas lipids, and serum lipoproteins. Acute hemorrhagic pancreatic necrosis (AHPN) with fat necrosis was induced in female mice by feeding a choline-deficient diet containing 0.5% DL-ethionine. Pancreatic lipase increases significantly prior to the onset of AHPN and is not accompanied by gross alterations in the lipid composition of the organs. In the same animals significant activities of pancreatic lipase were detected in serum and peritoneal cavity after 3 days of dietary regimen. Analysis of serum lipids and lipoproteins indicated no hyperlipemia prior to or after onset of AHPN.
