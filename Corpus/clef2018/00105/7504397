Effects of ethanol on the motility of papillary sphincter and exocrine pancreas in the monkey. The effects of acute and chronic ethanol administration on the motility of the papillary sphincter, pancreatic duct pressures, and exocrine pancreas were studied. Acute administration (n = 5) significantly reduced the peak pressure of the papillary sphincter from 84.2 +/- 19.6 to 15.8 +/- 3.0 mm Hg (p < 0.05) and increased the frequency from 0.041 +/- 0.002 to 0.067 +/- 0.005/s (p < 0.01). Chronic administration (n = 5) significantly increased pancreatic duct pressure and frequency of the papillary sphincter from 8.6 +/- 2.9 to 22.1 +/- 2.9 mm Hg (p < 0.01) and from 0.039 +/- 0.002 to 0.071 +/- 0.004/s (p < 0.01), respectively. However, it reduced the peak pressure of the papillary sphincter from 84.8 +/- 15.1 to 21.1 +/- 2.8 mm Hg (p < 0.05). Electron microscopy showed dilation and a concentric arrangement of the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the acinar cells. The exocrine function test showed an increased concentration and output of bicarbonate, protein, and amylase. These findings suggest that chronic alcohol intake may cause papillary dysfunction and pancreatic exocrine hypersecretion, which could play a role in increasing pancreatic duct pressure.
