The acute effects of pancreaticopyelostomy on the pancreas and kidney. A preliminary study. A modified canine pancreaticopyelostomy model with an intact kidney was constructed. The effects of this procedure on the pancreas and kidney were examined in five dogs by monitoring the serum and urine levels of pH, bicarbonate, chloride, glucose, urea, creatinine and amylase in 24-h periods for up to 72 h. The contralateral kidney served as controls. The pancreas and kidney were removed and examined under light microscopy after the animals were sacrificed. Both of the organs had maintained their normal histological architecture. The serum and urine glucose levels were consistent with a normal response after the initial elevation immediately following the surgical trauma. The urine urea concentrations from both kidneys were similar, as were the creatinine excretion trends throughout the 72 h, except for a significant rise in the creatinine excretion on the pancreaticopyelostomy side at 24 h. The pH, bicarbonate, chloride, and amylase values revealed a normal and functioning exocrine pancreas. It is concluded from this preliminary study that pancreaticopyelostomy with an intact kidney does not have acute adverse effects, either on the pancreas or on the kidney. This procedure may be an alternative method for pancreatic exocrine drainage if similar results are obtained in chronic models.
