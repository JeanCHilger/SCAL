Is the early diagnosis of a pancreatic neoplasm possible? A report and comparison of 2 clinical cases. Following a critical review of the international literature on the subject of cancer of the pancreas, the authors report two case studies of this pathology, one of which was diagnosed at a preclinical stage and underwent radical surgical exeresis. The authors draw attention to two factors which must be taken into consideration in this pathology: firstly, the need to extend screening tests in the group of high-risk patients, above all in those who drink three or more cups of coffee a day secondly, to re-evaluate the diagnostic use of two hematochemical tests, lipasemia and amylasemia, which are easily performed and available in all clinical laboratories.
