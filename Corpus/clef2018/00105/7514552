Canine model of chronic pancreatitis due to chronic ischemia. An experimental model of chronic pancreatitis was produced by a chronic ischemia which was induced by ligation and separation of branches flowing into the left pancreatic lobe from the splenic artery. Macroscopic findings at 3 and 6 months after model preparation showed that the pancreas was hard, with severe inflammatory change. In the secretin-cerulein test at 3 and 6 months, the flow rate of pancreatic juice, amylase output and bicarbonate concentration were significantly reduced as compared with the controls. The histopathological findings consisted of a decrease in the pancreatic parenchyma, replacement of fat, severe inflammatory cell infiltration, extensive fibrosis and tubular complexes. As this model closely resembles human chronic pancreatitis, we conclude that ischemia is an etiological factor in chronic pancreatitis.
