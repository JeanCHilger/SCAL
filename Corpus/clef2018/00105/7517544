Therapeutic and protective effect of subcutaneous injections of L-364,718 on caerulein-induced acute pancreatitis. The prophylactic and therapeutic effects of a potent cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonist, L-364,718, on acute pancreatitis induced by caerulein were evaluated, analyzing morphologic and functional pancreatic parameters jointly. Edematous pancreatitis was induced by four subcutaneous injections of caerulein (20 micrograms/kg) in rats at 1-h intervals. Prophylactic administration of L-364,718 (0.1 mg/kg) prevented rise in serum amylase levels, interstitial edema, vacuolization, and impairment of pancreatic enzyme secretion that accompany caerulein-induced acute pancreatitis. After 7 days, a spontaneous regression of the morphologic alterations caused by caerulein-induced acute pancreatitis occurs however, recovery of the secretory function of the pancreas was only reached after this period of time when L-364,718 was administered therapeutically (0.1 mg/kg/day). Prophylactically or therapeutically administered, L-364,718 exerts a beneficial effect on caerulein-induced acute pancreatitis, indicating that CCK (exogenous or endogenous) plays an important role in the development of this pathology.
