Effect of buprenorphine on pancreatic enzyme synthesis and secretion in normal rats and rats with acute edematous pancreatitis. Pancreatic enzyme secretion is inhibited during acute pancreatitis, resulting in an increase in acinar zymogen content. Since the premature activation of zymogens has been assigned a central role in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis, minimizing the amount of stored zymogens might lead to less severe acute pancreatitis. Inhibition of enzyme synthesis or stimulation of enzyme secretion would result in reduction of zymogen stores. Opiates have a varying effect on pancreatic secretion, depending on the dosage, site of administration, and presence of pancreatic stimulants. The effect of opiates and acute pancreatitis on individual pancreatic enzyme synthesis is unknown. The following study was undertaken in order to examine the effects of an opiate on pancreatic enzyme secretion and synthesis during experimental acute pancreatitis. Four groups of rats were studied. Group I received cerulein (25 micrograms/kg) group II received an opiate, buprenorphine (BPN, 0.5 mg/kg)
