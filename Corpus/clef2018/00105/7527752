Trypsin activity. A new marker of acute alcoholic pancreatitis. A normal serum amylase level is found in up to 32% of patients with acute alcoholic pancreatitis. This underlines the need for more sensitive diagnostic tests in this frequent cause of pancreatitis. Animal and human studies have shown that chronic alcohol consumption leads to important modifications in trypsinogen metabolism. The present work has prospectively analyzed admission serum trypsin activity with a new biochemical test and usual markers such as amylase, lipase, and immunoreactive trypsin in 32 attacks of acute pancreatitis. Seventeen were due to alcohol and 15 to other causes, including 11 with gallstone pancreatitis. High trypsin activity (median: 235 units/liter range: 165-853) was found in all patients with acute alcoholic pancreatitis even when the amylase level was normal on admission (3/17: 18%). Trypsin activity did not differ between nonalcoholic pancreatitis (N = 15): 84 units/liter (42-98), alcoholic controls (N = 15): 77 units/liter (40-122), and healthy controls (N = 62): 81 units/liter (15-143). The difference was not related to the severity of disease or circulating alpha 2-macroglobulin, alpha 1-protease inhibitor, or immunoreactive trypsinogen levels. Lipase/amylase ratio was less discriminant than trypsin activity between alcoholic and nonalcoholic diseases. We conclude that serum trypsin activity seems specific to acute alcoholic pancreatitis and should be included in new prospective studies assessing biochemical testing of alcohol-related pancreatic diseases.
