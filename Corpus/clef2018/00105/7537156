Surgery for pancreas divisum. Recurrent acute pancreatitis has a documented association with pancreas divisum. The intermittent inflammation of the gland is caused by episodic obstruction of pancreatic secretions at the minute dorsal duct orifice. Selection of appropriate patients for operative treatment is paramount if long-term success is to be achieved. Dorsal duct sphincterotomy alone, performed by a transduodenal approach, requires precise surgical technique. Long-term freedom from recurrent attacks of pancreatitis can be achieved by operative treatment.
