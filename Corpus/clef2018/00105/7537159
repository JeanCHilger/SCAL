Effect of PAF antagonists on cerulein-induced pancreatitis. The present study was undertaken to investigate the involvement of PAF in acute pancreatitis induced by cerulein in rats. Cerulein (two doses of 20 micrograms/rat, the first s.c. and the second i.v., 1 h apart) induced a significant increase in vascular permeability in the pancreas, evaluated by the Evans blue (EB) extravasation method. Plasma amylase levels were also significantly increased in this group. The PAF antagonists, BN-52021 (5 mg/kg) and WEB-2170 (1 and 10 mg/kg), both significantly reduced the extravasation of EB in the pancrease induced by i.v. injection of PAF (1 microgram/kg). At these concentrations, BN-52021 was effective at inhibiting cerulein-induced pancreatitis (60-70% of inhibition) whereas WEB-2170 had no significant effect. Although the inhibition induced by BN-52021 suggests the involvement of PAF in cerulein-pancreatitis, the lack of effect of WEB-2170 reported here does not allow a definite conclusion. Further studies are needed to elucidate the differential effect of the PAF antagonists.
