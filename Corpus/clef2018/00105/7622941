Effects of C1-esterase inhibitor in three models of acute pancreatitis. The present studies were done to evaluate the therapeutic potential of C1-esterase inhibitor in three different models of acute pancreatitis: (1) Edematous pancreatitis with acinar cell necrosis was induced by 7-h ip injections of 50 micrograms/kg cerulein in mice (2) Hemorrhagic pancreatitis was induced by feeding a choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented (CDE) diet in mice
