Free fatty acids and acute pancreatitis. An in vivo experimental study. Experimental in vitro studies support a theory which attributes a key role to pancreatic lipase in the physiopathology of acute pancreatitis. Pancreatic lipase would hydrolyse triglycerides either in circulation or in tissues, releasing Free Fatty Acids (F.F.A.). These F.F.A. would contribute to the genesis of necrotizing lesions by their detergent properties. This experimental work, tried to confirm this theory in vivo in rats, using the cerulein-induced pancreatitis model (four injections 20 micrograms/kg of cerulein subcutaneously). It has been demonstrated first that a five-times increase of circulating plasma F.F.A. (3.02 +/- 0.28 mmol/l versus 0.75 +/- 0.05 mmol/l in control) dit not worsen cerulein-induced pancreatitis and were rather protective than deleterious. Furthermore, F.F.A. levels did not increase either in portal and aortic plasma during these pancreatitis, despite a major lipase release. There was also no increase of pancreatic content of F.F.A., measured by organic extraction performed on pancreatic homogenates. The role commonly attributed to F.F.A. in acute pancreatitis, based on in vitro experiments seems questionable in vivo.
