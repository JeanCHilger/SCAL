Effect of prostaglandin E on the redistribution of lysosomal enzymes in caerulein-induced pancreatitis. The redistribution of cathepsin B, a representative lysosomal enzyme, from the lysosomal pellet to the zymogen pellet in subcellular fractions and the colocalization of cathepsin B with digestive enzymes within acinar cells have been found during the early stage of caerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in the rat. This study investigated the protective effects of prostaglandins E1 and E2 on the exocrine pancreas in this experimental pancreatitis. Prostaglandin E2, but not E1, prevented the redistribution of cathepsin B along with the hyperamylasemia, and the increase in amylase and trypsinogen in the acinar cells in almost a dose-dependent manner, particularly at a dose of 100 micrograms/kg.hr of continuous infusion. These results suggest that subcellular organelle fragility is closely related to the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis, and that prostaglandin E2 has an important cytoprotective effect on biological membranes as a stabilizer of lysosomal membrane.
