Protective effect of AA-861 (5-lipoxygenase inhibitor) on experimental acute necrotizing pancreatitis in rats. The effect of the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor AA-861 on acute necrotizing pancreatitis was studied in an experimental model. Pancreatitis was induced in rats by retrograde injection of 0.4 mL/kg body wt of 6% taurocholic acid into the pancreatic duct. The animals were divided into three groups: control group administered AA-861 in a single dose of 30 mg/kg
