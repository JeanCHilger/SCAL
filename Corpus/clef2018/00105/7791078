Effects of the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist S 16118 (p-guanidobenzoyl-[Hyp3,Thi5,D-Tic7,Oic8]bradykinin) in different in vivo animal models of inflammation. The effects of S 16118 (p-guanidobenzoyl-[Hyp3,Thi5,D-Tic7, Oic8]bradykinin (BK)], a new, potent and long-acting BK B2 antagonist, were tested in some in vivo models of inflammation. In rats, S 16118 (0.1 and 1 mg/kg) given i.v. or s.c. delayed the edema formation induced by intraplantar carrageenan injections up to 4 hr after administration, confirming the involvement of kinins in this inflammatory reaction. In guinea pigs treated with atropine, vagal stimulation induced bronchial microvascular leakage. Aerosolization of S 16118 (5 x 10(-3) M for 20 sec), 4 min before vagus nerve stimulation, induced a 60% decrease in the Evans blue extravasation, demonstrating the modulatory role of BK in neurogenic inflammation. In rats, caerulein infusion (4 nmol/kg/hr) induced hypotension, massive pancreatic edema, hypovolemia due to plasma leakage and an increase in serum lipase and amylase activity. S 16118 (100 nmol/kg s.c.) prevented the hypotension, the pancreatic edema and the hypovolemia and induced a marked increase in the serum lipase and amylase activity. This confirms that BK, acting on BK B2 receptors, is involved in this model of pancreatitis. In rabbits, the injection of lipopolysaccharides (LPS 600 micrograms/kg i.v.) induced hypotension, metabolic acidosis and leukopenia. S 16118 (1.73 mumol/kg i.v.) did not influence the effects of LPS injection. In mice, i.p. LPS (25 mg/kg) administration induced over 90% mortality in 96 hr. S 16118 (1 mg/kg x 4), given 30 min before LPS injection and 4, 8 and 24 hr after LPS injection, did not influence the mortality rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
