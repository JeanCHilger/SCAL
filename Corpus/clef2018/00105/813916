Antiserum raised against human pancreatic alpha-amylase. Isozymes of human pancreatic alpha-amylase were used as immunogens to raise antisera in rabbits. These antisera were unable to differentiate between the two isoamylases but produced an almost total inhibition of serum amylase activity when used at a dilution of 1 : 5000. Similar inhibition patterns were produced with the salivary and urinary enzymes as well as with serum from a patient with acute pancreatitis. No cross reactivity of the antisera with hog pancreatic amylase was observed and only at antiserum concentrations of 1 : 5000 and above was ther any inhibition of monkey serum amylase. The degree of inhibition observed varied with the size of the substrate but was not increased by the use of a second antibody.
