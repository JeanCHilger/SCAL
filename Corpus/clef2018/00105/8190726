No parallel between the biochemical course of acute pancreatitis and morphologic findings. The clinical, biochemical (serum enzymes), and morphologic course of acute pancreatitis was studied in 83 consecutive patients from time of admission until 3 months after discharge. At discharge, all 75 surviving patients had no more symptoms of acute pancreatitis, even though amylase (in 11%) and lipase (in 25%) were still elevated, computed tomography (CT) findings still abnormal (in 81%), and necrosis amounting up to 50% of the gland still present (in 24%). There was no significant correlation between serum enzymes and CT findings at discharge. Three months later, with the exception of one patient with an acute relapse of the disease, all followed-up patients were free of symptoms and had normal serum amylase, whereas lipase was still elevated in 10%, and CT findings abnormal in 23%. Subsiding symptoms provided a more accurate picture of the patients' recovery than the biochemical markers, and even more so that the morphologic findings.
