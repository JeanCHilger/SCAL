Evidence for extraluminal trypsinogen activation in three different models of acute pancreatitis. Inappropriate extraluminal activation of trypsin is assumed to play a part in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis (AP), but proof has been elusive because active trypsin is transient and difficult to measure. We have previously shown increased levels of trypsinogen activation peptides (TAP), a direct measure of trypsin activation, to correlate with severity of AP, tissue necrosis, and survival in a rodent model induced by cerulein hyperstimulation and bile salt infusion. The present study seeks to show that increased trypsinogen activation also characterizes three other models of experimental AP in rodents to give credence to the generality of the phenomenon and to its potential relevance to human AP.Experimental AP was induced in mice by a choline-deficient diet supplemented with ethionine and in rats by creation of a closed duodenal loop or by ligation of the biliopancreatic duct plus physiologic stimulation. TAP were quantified by an immunoassay in tissue and plasma at various time points after onset of AP.In the group with choline-deficient diet supplemented with ethionine a significant increase in tissue and plasma TAP was found at 48 and 72 hours, respectively. In the group with closed duodenal loop significant TAP elevations were found in plasma as early as 6 hours and in the group with ligation of the biliopancreatic duct plus physiologic stimulation at 24 hours.These experiments provide further evidence that extraluminal protease activation is a pathophysiologic event common to the evolution of various models of experimental acute pancreatitis and therefore increase the likelihood that this phenomenon is important in the human disease as well.
