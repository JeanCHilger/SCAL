Acute pancreatitis in pregnancy. This paper describes a case of acute pancreatitis occurring in a patient immediately after delivery and in primigravida. The patient had a family case history of dyslipidemia (Type IV). The pregnancy had been complicated by preeclampsia treated at home with nifedipine tablets (one tablet three times a day) with good results on pressure values lipidic values were high despite dietary measures taken. The baby at birth weighed 3830 g after physiologic labour and a natural delivery. Acute pancreatitis was diagnosed after observation of epigastralgia with irradiation on the left shoulder, vomiting, symptoms of acute abdomen such as sweating, increased pulse rate, hypotension, abdominal pain on palpation, and absence of peristalsis. An analysis of the blood showed high levels of amylase and hyperglycemia, an increase in XDP, and leucocytosis. Instrumental tests such as pancreatic echography revealed an increase in pancreatic volume, uneven structure of the parenchyma and higher levels of liquid in the peritoneum. The patient was moved to intensive-care, a nasal gastric probe inserted, hydroelectrolytic treatment was begun, vital functions monitored, pain kept under control by medical therapy, and antibiotics administered. Subsequent tests showed an improvement in the parameters of pancreatic functions (amylase, lipase, calcium hematic) and their gradual return to normal values. The computerized tomography of abdomen additionally revealed the presence of pancreatic pseudo-cysts and effusion of peritoneal liquid near the right kidney. The patient was discharged after two weeks in the surgical ward. There are many caused of acute abdomen during and immediately after pregnancy, and one of these is acute pancreatitis, though rare (occurring between 1:3800 and 11.467 according to Rabkin).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
