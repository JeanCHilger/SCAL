Ceftriaxone-induced acute pancreatitis. To report a case probable ceftriaxone-induced acute pancreatitis.A patient with a history of short-bowel syndrome on home total parenteral nutrition developed fever, chills, and right flank pain. She was diagnosed with gram-negative catheter sepsis and prescribed antibiotic therapy to be administered for four weeks. After completion of the first week of therapy, the antibiotic regimen was changed to intravenous injections of ceftriaxone to be given daily at home. Prior to discharge the patient developed acute abdominal pain, leukocytosis, jaundice, and markedly elevated lipase and amylase concentrations consistent with acute pancreatitis. The patient's condition improved upon discontinuation of the ceftriaxone and the remainder of her stay was uneventful.There is only one other case report in the literature of probable ceftriaxone-induced pancreatitis. Multiple other medications have been implicated in causing acute pancreatitis. The exact mechanism of this uncommon adverse effect of ceftriaxone is unknown.There was a temporal relationship between the development of this patient's signs and symptoms and the administration of ceftriaxone. We could not identify any other factors that may have been responsible for the development of her acute pancreatitis. Ceftriaxone should be considered as a possible etiologic agent in patients who present with acute abdominal pain and elevated lipase and amylase concentrations.
