En bloc kidney and whole pancreaticoduodenal transplantation with bladder drainage in the rat: microsurgical technique and outcome. A microsurgical technique for en bloc kidney and whole pancreaticoduodenal transplantation with bladder drainage employing triple vascular anastomoses without the need for a vascular cuff is described. Nineteen combined isografts were performed using this technique in inbred male Lewis (RT1:I) rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Six recipients died within 1 month from early complications (two from uremia, two from pancreatitis, one from bleeding, one from peritonitis) the other 13 survived more than 1 month after transplantation with both the pancreas and kidney grafts functioning. Four of the 13 rats died after 1 month (one from uremia secondary to an obstructed ureter, one from unexplained uremia, one from peritonitis after a biopsy, and one of unknown causes). The pancreas isografts of two animals were excised at 1 and 3 months to confirm dependence on the graft
