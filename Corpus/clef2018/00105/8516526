Acute pancreatitis after resection of abdominal aortic aneurysm. The case of a patient who developed acute pancreatitis following resection of a ruptured aneurysm of the abdominal aorta is presented. During the first postoperative days the patient evolved satisfactorily except for specific abdominal symptoms. On the sixth day the patient suddenly presented tachycardia, hypotension, increase in abdominal distension and anemia for which emergency laparotomy was performed with signs of diffuse peritoneal steatonecrosis with an increase in the size and inflammation of the pancreas with necrotic and hemorrhagic zones being observed. The patient developed multiorganic failure and died at 18 days later. In this case, as in others described in the literature the beginning was uneventful. Only the determination of amylase and/or lipase, and the performance of abdominal CAT when these are increased, may be useful to obtain early diagnosis.
