Deficiency in antioxidant factors in patients with alcohol-related chronic pancreatitis. Free radicals have been suspected to play a role in the pathogenicity of alcohol-related chronic pancreatitis. The aim of this study was to determine the status of several antioxidant parameters in these patients and examine the factors that are likely to influence them. Thirty-five subjects (23 males and 12 females, mean age 48 +/- 8 years) with disease proven by endoscopic pancreatography and 14 healthy controls (6 males and 8 females, mean age 44 +/- 7 years) were included in the study. Biochemical antioxidant parameters included: selenium, zinc, and copper levels in plasma glutathione peroxidase in plasma and erythrocytes
