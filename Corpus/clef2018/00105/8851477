A model of experimental acute necrotizing pancreatitis. A model of moderate acute necrotizing pancreatitis is essential for the study of the pathophysiology of the disease and novel therapies. We tried to establish a model of bile salt-induced acute necrotizing pancreatitis in rats.Acute pancreatitis was induced by retrograde infusion of bile salt into the cannulated pancreatobiliary duct. Twenty-six rats wee divided into 3 groups. Group I (n = 8) received 0.2 ml of glycodeoxycholic acid (GDOC) 10 mmol/l group II (n = 10) 0.2 ml of 2.5% sodium taurodeoxycholate (NaTDC)Serum levels of amylase and lipase increased significantly in 5 hours in all the groups. Serum amylase levels were significantly lower in group III than in group II. No significant difference of serum lipase was found among the groups. Group II had the highest scores of necrosis and acinar cell vacuolization, whereas group III had the highest scores of leukocyte infiltration and edema. The degree of necrosis was significantly more severe in group II than in group I. The hematocrit increased significantly in 5 hours in groups I and II. The mean arterial pressure in 5 hours decreased significantly in group I. There was no significant difference of the changes of heart rate in 5 hours among 3 groups.Intraductal infusion of NaTDC was a good method to induce moderate acute necrotizing pancreatitis in rats. GDOC caused mild pancreatitis, and pancreatic injury was aggravated when enterokinase was added. The severity of pancreatic histopathology was not correlated with the changes of serum levels of pancreatic enzymes, hematocrit or mean arterial pressure at the early stage of pancreatitis.
