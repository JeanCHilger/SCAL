Somatostatin in the treatment of a pancreatic pseudocyst in a child. Pancreatic pseudocyst is a know complication of acute pancreatitis and pancreatic trauma. The treatment of pancreatitis remains a challenge and the pancreatic pseudocyst is often approached surgically. Lately, the use of somatostatin and its long-acting analogue octreotide have proved useful in the treatment of pancreatitis and its complications in adults. This is the first report on the use of somatostatin in the treatment of a pancreatic pseudocyst in a child. We present the case of a posttraumatic pancreatic pseudocyst in a 10-year-old boy, regressing rapidly under somatostatin treatment, by which means surgical re-intervention could be avoided.
