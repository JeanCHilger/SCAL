Free radical enhancement promotes leucocyte recruitment through a PAF and LTB4 dependent mechanism. In the present investigation we studied the concerted role of superoxide anion, platelet activating factor (PAF) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) in the mechanism that results in polymorphonuclear leucocyte accumulation induced by oxygen free radicals in rat pancreas. This was done by comparing the effects of a PAF antagonist (BN-52021), a LTB4 inhibitor (MK-886) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in a experimental rat model of inflammation elicited by the oxygen free radicals induced via infusion of xanthine/xanthine oxidase. Also, the effect of independent LTB4 infusion has been studied. The results show that increases in polymorphonuclear cell infiltration (evaluated by tissue histology), myeloperoxidase and LTB4 levels induced in pancreas by infusion of xanthine/xanthine oxidase were abolished by the administration of either the PAF antagonist, the LTB4 inhibitor, or SOD. The fact that BN-52021 could prevent neutrophil recruitment and LTB4 synthesis suggests that PAF is a necessary step for subsequent LTB4 synthesis and polymorphonuclear leucocyte accumulation.
