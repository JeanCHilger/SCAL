Hepatocyte growth factor in assessment of acute pancreatitis: comparison with C-reactive protein and interleukin-6. Serum levels of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were determined at the time of admission in 38 patients with acute pancreatitis. The clinical utility of HGF for the detection of severe pancreatitis and for predicting prognosis, bacterial infection (infected pancreatic necrosis or sepsis), and organ dysfunction (liver, kidney, and lung) during the clinical course of acute pancreatitis was compared with the clinical utility of CRP and IL-6 by analysis of receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves. The optimum cutoff levels of HGF for severity, prognosis, infection, hepatic dysfunction, renal dysfunction, and respiratory dysfunction were 0.9, 1.1, 1.0, 1.1, 1.1, and 1.0 ng/ml, respectively. HGF was as useful as CRP and more useful than IL-6 for detection of severe pancreatitis and for predicting hepatic dysfunction. Moreover, HGF was more useful than CRP or IL-6 for predicting prognosis, renal dysfunction, and respiratory dysfunction. However, for predicting infection, CRP was more useful than HGF. These results suggest that serum HGF levels on admission may be a useful new clinical parameter for determining the prognosis of acute pancreatitis and that HGF may be closely related to the organ dysfunction of acute pancreatitis.
