Acute pancreatitis-induced enzyme release and necrosis are attenuated by IL-1 antagonism through an indirect mechanism. Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1) is a proinflammatory cytokine which is produced within the pancreas during acute pancreatitis reaching levels which are toxic to many cell types. Since antagonism of this cytokine provides dramatic survival benefits during lethal pancreatitis, we hypothesized that IL-1 had direct secretagogue and cytolytic effects within the pancreas. The effect of IL-1 on pancreatic exocrine function and tissue viability was assessed in vivo by blockade of IL-1 with varying doses of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) prior to the induction of either moderate (caerulein-induced) or severe (choline deficient diet-induced) necrotizing pancreatitis. Subsequent in vitro studies were conducted to determine the direct effect of IL-1 on dispersed rat acini prepared through collagenase digestion. Amylase release was measured after a 30-min incubation with varying doses of recombinant IL-1 beta. Viability was determined in the presence of IL-1 via trypan blue exclusion at multiple time points. Blockade of the IL-1 receptor decreased pancreatic amylase release and tissue necrosis in both models of pancreatitis in a dose-dependent fashion (1.0 mg/kg, P = NS 10 mg/kg, P < 0.05
