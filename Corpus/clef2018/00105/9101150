Botulinum toxin injection as a diagnostic tool for verification of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction causing recurrent pancreatitis. Sphincter of Oddi dyskinesia (SOD) is among the less frequent causes of acute recurrent pancreatitis. We report on a patient with frequent pain attacks accompanied by pancreatic enzyme elevation, in whom a transitory decrease of the SO pressure following endoscopic botulinus toxin injection was a diagnostic clue for SOD. The patient's symptoms resolved for 4 months, after which time recurrent symptoms paralleled the reoccurrence of the elevated SO pressure. Endoscopic sphincterotomy of the biliary sphincter relieved her symptoms for the subsequent follow-up period which is now 10 months.
