Functional consequences of adenovirus-mediated murine pancreatic gene transfer. Pancreatic adenoviral gene transfer can be achieved with high efficiency however, questions concerning tissue injury from this commonly used vector have not been addressed. In these experiments, the effects of adenoviral gene transfer on pancreatic exocrine function were evaluated. Direct pancreatic injection with an adenoviral vector containing the Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase (beta-Gal
