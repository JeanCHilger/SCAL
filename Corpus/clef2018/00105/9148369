Serum interleukin-6 in acute pancreatitis due to common bile duct stones. A reliable marker of necrosis. In a prospective clinical study we have assessed the value of serum interleukin-6 in comparison with C-reactive protein in discriminating necrotizing from oedematous acute pancreatitis due to common bile duct stones in the first hours of disease. The study comprised 36 patients with acute biliary pancreatitis inclusion criteria were admission in hospital within 48 hours from the onset of symptoms, availability of contrast enhanced CT scan within 72 hours from admission and presence of common bile duct stones at early ERCP. A sample of serum was taken at hospitalization and interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein were measured. Interleukin-6 levels were significantly higher in necrotizing pancreatitis, being closely related to the extension of necrosis. C-reactive protein showed low efficacy in detecting necrotizing forms, although its levels were higher than in oedematous. We conclude that serum interleukin-6 is a very reliable marker of necrosis in the first 48 hours of acute biliary pancreatitis.
