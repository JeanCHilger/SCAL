The effect of beta-thia-iminoprostacyclin in taurocholate acute pancreatitis in rats: the role of antecedent acute ethanol abuse. The promoting effect of acute ethanol (E) abuse and protective effect of prostaglandin derivatives in acute pancreatitis (AP) remain obscure. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of previous intake of high-dose E on trypsinogen (Tn) activation and labilization of pancreatic lysosomal membranes (PLM), in taurocholate AP in rats, considering treatment with stable beta-thia-iminoprostacyclin (T). In 60 male Wistar rats taurocholate AP was induced or a sham operation was performed. Half of them received 40% E (5 g/kg body weight), 6 h earlier. T (0.3 mg/kg body weight i.g.) was applied before E or before the induction of AP. Free active (FAT) and total potential (TPT) trypsin, free (F) and total (T) cathepsin B, phospholipase A2 (PLA2), and lipase (L) activities were assayed. Percentage FAT/TPT was an index of Tn activation and fractional free (% F/T) activity of cathepsin B was an index of PLM fragility. FAT increased after 12 h of AP, and in E rats this increase was even more evident. Pretreatment and treatment with T partly prevented this increase, however, this effect was abolished or limited in rats previously given E-the changes were not effected by T. PLA2 and L activities in AP were not diminished after T. The promoting effect of acute E abuse prior to AP could be dependent on augmented activation of Tn and labilization of PLM. The protective effect of T seems to be dependent on the decrease in Tn activation in pancreatitic tissue. The potential therapeutic effect of this drug in AP could be limited by previous acute E intake, as evidenced by differences in histopathological changes.
