Serum isoamylase pattern in obstructive pancreatic disease. On agarose gel electrophoresis the pancreatic serum isoamylases can be separated into a main fraction and more anodally migrating minor fractions. In acute pancreatic hyperamylasemia as in normal subjects the activity of the anodally migrating pancreatic amylase does not exceed 20% of the activity of the main fraction. In patients with pancreatic main duct occlusion or stenosis with or without calculi or cysts, the anodally migrating pancreatic amylase increases proportionally more than does the main fraction, and can even be stronger than the main fraction. The majority of these patients also had abnormally increased total pancreatic serum amylase activity.
