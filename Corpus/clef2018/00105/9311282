A case of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with drug-induced acute pancreatitis due to mizoribine. A rare case of mizoribine-induced acute pancreatitis is presented. A 39-year-old female with RA was admitted to our hospital because of upper abdominal pain, fever and the elevation of serum amylase concentration. Acute pancreatitis was diagnosed. Mizoribine (MZB) had been administered for 12 days for the treatment of RA before the onset of pancreatitis. Withdrawal of MZB soon resulted in the improvement of the disease. She was asymptomatic for the next few weeks. The pancreatitis recurred 36 hours after she took MZB again on her own judgement for arthralgia. This clinical course strongly suggested that her pancreatitis was due to MZB. Acute pancreatitis due to MZB has never, to our knowledge, been reported. MZB is commonly used for the treatment of RA. Therefore the clinician should take care for the complication of acute pancreatitis even though it is rare.
