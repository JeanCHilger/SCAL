Use of pancreozymin for detection of pancreatic enzyme-secreting insufficiency in diabetic patients and selection of methods of treatment. Under conditions of stimulation with pancreozymine (in doses of 1.5 and 0.5 Units/kg), a specific stimulant of the enzyme secretion of the pancreas, there occurred a significant fall of the concentration and of the amount of lipase and trypsin in the duodenal contents of patients suffering from diabetes mellitus for over 5 years (20 investigations) in comparison with the indices in 14 healthy persons. No disturbances of amylase secretion were found in diabetes. Proceeding from the evidence on the role played by calcium and cyclic 3'--5'-adenosinmonophosphate in the regulation of the external pancreatic secretion the effect of calcium gluconate and euphylline was tested they appeared to be effective stimulants of pancreatic secretion of the enzymes in patients with diabetes mellitus.
