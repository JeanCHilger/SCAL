Pancreatitis in systemic scleroderma. We report the case of a 61-year-old woman, who suffered from abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and fever. She had a past medical history of acute rheumatism, pyelonephritis and systemic scleroderma. Since 1971 she was hospitalized many times because of recurrent abdominal pain with increased serum amylase and lipase values. On admission, she was in distress and demonstrated clinical signs of acute pancreatitis. The link between systemic lupus erythematosus and acute pancreatitis is discussed in view of the reported cases of the world literature.
