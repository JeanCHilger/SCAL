Change of pancreatic enzymes, pancreatic stone protein (PSP), and plasma alpha(2)-macroglobulin-trypsin complex-like substance (MTLS) in the activation of pancreatic juice. To characterize the activation of pancreatic zymogens (trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, and proelastase 1) in acute pancreatitis, we studied the activation of pancreatic juice with porcine enteropeptidase in vitro, and then enzymatic activities and the generation of pancreatic stone protein (PSP) S1 form in pancreatic juice were investigated. Further, we determined immunoreactive trypsin, immunoreactive elastase 1, PSP, and alpha(2)-macroglobulin-trypsin complex-like substance (MTLS) levels in plasma to which the activated juice was added. In the present report, we demonstrate that the plasma MTLS level reflected the activation of pancreatic trypsinogen in pancreatic juice. Further, the generation of PSP S1 form was found at an early stage of activation. Therefore, the plasma MTLS level and the generation of PSP S1 form may offer new diagnostic information on the amounts of activated proteases and subsequently on the severity of acute pancreatitis.
