TGF-beta 1 and IL-6--new aspects in pancreas regeneration? Plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta 1) were studied during cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8)-induced regeneration after pancreas resection in rats. The weight of the pancreas and the DNA and protein contents increased significantly. The serum levels of TGF-beta 1 and IL-6 were increased significantly on days 7 and 14. There was no significant change in serum amylase levels. These findings indicate that cytokines such as TGF-beta 1 and IL-6 may play a role in the pathomechanism of pancreas regeneration.
