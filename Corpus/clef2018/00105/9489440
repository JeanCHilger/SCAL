A case of a large pancreatic pseudocyst in the pleural cavity treated with percutaneous needle aspiration. A case of 56-year old man with a large fluid collection in right pleural cavity is described. One year before he had been treated due to acute pancreatitis and its complications (infected peripancreatic necrosis, spleen rupture, subhepatic abscess, chronic pancreatitis). Now 1300 mL of browny fluid was evacuated by needle aspirations and pancreatic origin fluid was confirmed with laboratory tests (amylase activity was 10260 U/L). Percutaneous aspiration was performed twice and resulted in a complete resolution of the cyst. A review of methods of treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts and indications of these treatments is made.
