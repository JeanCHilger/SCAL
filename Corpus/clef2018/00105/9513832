Serum C-reactive protein in acute biliary pancreatitis. Is it a reliable marker for the early assessment of severity of the disease? The cut-off point of serum C-reactive protein to differentiate the mild from the severe form of acute pancreatitis is still debated data concerning the C-reactive protein pattern in assessing the severity of acute biliary pancreatitis are lacking.To define the best cut-off point in differentiating the severe from the mild form of acute biliary pancreatitis.Fifty patients with acute biliary pancreatitis: 34 patients with mild pancreatitis and 16 with the severe form of the disease were studied.Serum C-reactive protein concentrations were assessed in all patients upon admission and for the following 5 days.No significant difference in serum C-reactive protein levels was found in the first 2 days in patients with mild pancreatitis compared to those with the severe form of the disease. Using a cut-off point of 11 mg/dl, the sensitivity of serum C-reactive protein in assessing the severity of acute pancreatitis during the first two days of the study was 9% and 57%, the specificity, 93% and 81%, and the accuracy 71% and 74%, respectively.Serum determination of C-reactive protein in the first 48 hours of the disease is not a reliable marker of the severity of acute biliary pancreatitis.
