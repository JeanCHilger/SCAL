Benzoylarginine amidase activity of blood serum and plasma in acute pancreatitis. In 40 patients with acute pancreatitis, examined 3-2 and 18-24 hours following the onset of the disease, benzoylarginine-amidase activity in blood serum and plasma was determined, as well as the activity of lipase and amylase in blood serum. A correlative dependence was found between the activity of amylase and lipase in blood serum, the activity of amylase in blood serum and trypsin-like activity in blood plasma of patients investigated in different time.
