Clinical effects of anticancer drugs to pancreatic diseases as protein synthesis inhibitors. The anticancer drugs, like 5-Fluorouracil, which are believed to interfere with enzyme protein synthesis in the exocrine cells of pancreas were administered intravenously to fifteen patients with various pancreatic diseases. The improvement of clinical symptoms and the diminution of serum and urinary amylase levels were observed in four cases with acute pancreatitis and two cases with chronic relapsing pancreatitis. The postoperative complications, namely the formation of pancreatic fistula and the rupture of pancreaticojejunostomy, or the aggravation of concomitant pancreatitis were not observed in three cases with benign surgical pancreatic diseases and six cases with pancreatic carcinoma. Furthermore, the diminution of amylase and protein output of pancreatic juice from canulae inserted into pancreatic ducts were observed.
