Necrotizing pancreatitis following radical cystectomy for infiltrating bladder carcinoma. Mortality from radical cystectomy is still high, in some series accounting for 1-10% deaths. Morbidity is even higher and can reach 50%. This paper contributes the case of a 66-year old male patient diagnosed with an infiltrant tumour of the bladder following TUR. The patient's background included prior surgery for gastroduodenal ulcus, alcohol consumption, and obesity. Following routine pre-operatory investigations, the patient underwent radical cystectomy using routine techniques and urinary by-pass via transcolonic ureterosigmoidostomy. Increased transaminases, leucocytosis, vomiting, jaundice and extended intestinal ileum were noted during the patient's post-operative period, while blood and urine amylase concentrations were moderately high. Following CAT study, laparotomy was performed and the diagnosed confirmed. The patient died on day 14 of surgery due to secondary pulmonary complications. Post-operative pancreatitis is a low-frequency, high-mortality acknowledged complication. Even though most cases are secondary to biliarypancreatic and surrounding pancreas area surgery, it has also been described in some instances of distant surgery such as the present case. Alcohol consumption, biliary lithiasis, prior cholecystectomy and diabetes are predisposing factors. High amylase values do not always accompany this condition. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for the patient's prognosis. Respiratory complications are the usual cause of death in these patients.
