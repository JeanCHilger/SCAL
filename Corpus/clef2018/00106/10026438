Clinical evaluation of cholecystokinin-A- receptor antagonist (loxiglumide) for the treatment of acute pancreatitis. A preliminary clinical trial. Study Group of Loxiglumide in Japan. The therapeutic effects of loxiglumide on human acute pancreatitis was investigated in 104 Japanese institutes from October 1992 to March 1994. Acute pancreatitis was diagnosed by the Japanese Criteria of Acute Pancreatitis. Soon after the diagnosis was made, one of three doses of loxiglumide (100, 300 and 500 mg/day) were injected intravenously twice a day for 14 days. The efficacy of the treatment was evaluated by clinical signs, physical signs, and biochemical findings. 189 patients were included in this trial. The clinical signs, such as abdominal pain, disappeared in 20% of the patients on the 1st day after treatment, and the rate of improvements increased thereafter. Physical signs also improved. Serum amylase levels returned to normal within 3 days after treatment, and serum lipase showed almost the same changes as serum amylase levels, but serum lipase levels in the high-dose group (500 mg/day) returned to normal more quickly compared with the other two doses. It is concluded that the cholecystokinin A receptor antagonist, loxiglumide, may become a useful drug in the treatment of acute pancreatitis in man, although more detailed investigations are needed.
