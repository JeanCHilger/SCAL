Glucagon in the treatment of acute pancreatitis (clinical contribution). 16 patients suffering from acute pancreatitis were treated by intramuscular or intravenous administration of glucagon, with control of the amylasemia and amylasuria values at the start of treatment, the 12th hour and the 36th hour. By the 12th hour from the start of therapy they already observed a reduction in amylasemia and amylasuria to normal values, with disappearance of the symptomatology (pains, vomiting, shock) and complete cure of the patients in 94% of cases. On the basis of their own and others' experience, the Authors therefore believe that glucagon can advantageously be used in this disease, which is characterised by much higher mortality if treated with the traditional therapeutic means.
