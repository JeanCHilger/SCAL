Molecular forms of serum pancreatic stone protein in acute pancreatitis. Elevation of serum pancreatic stone protein-(PSP) S1 suggests activation of trypsinogen in the pancreas. This information would prompt the start of intensive treatment and may improve prognosis of acute pancreatitis (AP).PSP exists in two molecular forms, PSP-S2-5 and PSP-S1. PSP-S1 is produced by enzyme cleavage of PSP-S2-5 by trypsin. Total serum PSP rose in AP, but little is known about its molecular forms. In this study, we characterized the molecular forms of serum PSP in AP.Sera were taken from 8 patients with severe acute pancreatitis (sAP) and from 11 patients with mild acute pancreatitis (mAP). Serum PSP was characterized by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) followed by the specific enzyme immunoassay (EIA).The total serum PSP in sAP was higher than in mAP, but the difference was not significant. The PSP-S1 was detected in serum in all (7/7) patients in sAP and in 72% (8/11) of patients in mAP. Serum level of PSP-S1 was significantly higher in sAP than that in mAP (p < 0.05), and the cutoff value to distinguish the two groups was 30 ng/mL. Serum PSP-S1 did not show significant correlation with total PSP, immunoreactive trypsin, or C-reactive protein.
