Acute pancreatitis after aortic surgery. Acute pancreatitis (AP) after aortic surgery has rarely been reported. A retrospective review of all abdominal and thoracoabdominal aortic operations complicated with AP from January 1982 to March 1992 was performed to study the presentation and outcome of this infrequently recognized complication. Thirteen cases of AP were found among 1965 abdominal aortic operations (0.7% incidence). The distribution of the original aortic operations was as follows: eight elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs, two aortoiliac grafts for aortoiliac occlusive disease, and three aortorenal bypasses. Two cases of pancreatitis complicated 170 thoracoabdominal aortic operations (1.2% incidence). Ten patients had mild pancreatitis, nine were discharged without any pancreatic complications after receiving supportive treatment. Five patients with severe AP died of multisystem organ failure despite aggressive surgical treatment 4 had infected necrosis. The overall mortality was 40 per cent
