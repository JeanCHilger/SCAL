Zymogen granule alterations in caerulein-induced pancreatitis developed during continuous hydrocortisone administration. The amount of enzymes stored in individual zymogen granules and the glycosylation of their membrane have been analysed in rats with acute pancreatitis induced by caerulein after hydrocortisone treatment. The consequences of prolonging hydrocortisone administration after pancreatitis and the use of the cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonist, L-364,718, have also been evaluated.Analysis was performed using flow cytometry.Caerulein-induced pancreatitis in rats previously treated for 7 days with hydrocortisone (10 mg kg-1 per day) revealed alterations in enzyme storage in the pancreas. Significant increases in amylase and trypsinogen contents in zymogen granules were observed, an effect associated with a reduction in L-fucose glycoconjugates. Pancreatitis persists 7 days later if hydrocortisone treatment is prolonged. At this stage, a reduced granule fucosylation was still observed, and a significant decrease in the amount of trypsinogen stored in the granules was found. However, hydrocortisone administration led to an increase in intragranular amylase quantities up to normal values, even when L-364,718 was simultaneously administered, but it reverted to plasma as a consequence of pancreatitis. The amount of N-acetyl D-glucosamine in the zymogen granule membrane was not altered by caerulein acute pancreatitis induced under continuous hydrocortisone treatment, but it was decreased by the administration of L-364,718 over 7 days after pancreatitis induction.The administration of hydrocortisone after the development of pancreatitis prevented recurrence of the disease. L-364,718 proved to be detrimental, not only failing to reduce the symptoms of pancreatitis but also altering the glycoproteins of zymogen granule membrane.
