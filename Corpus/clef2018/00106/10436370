Beneficial effects of hydrocortisone in a model of experimental acute pancreatitis. Proinflammatory cytokines like TNF-alpha and IL-8 have been thought to play a pivotal role in the propagation of severe acute pancreatitis (AP) and the development of its systemic complications, particularly acute lung injury.To investigate the effects of pretreatment with hydrocortisone on the production of cytokines and the occurrence of acute lung injury in rabbits with AP.AP was induced in 17 rabbits by infusion of 5% chenodeoxycholic acid into the pancreatic duct, followed by ductal ligation. The rabbits were allocated to pretreatment with subcutaneous and intravenous hydrocortisone (25 mg/kg, respectively n = 7) or 0.9% saline (n = 10) 30 min before induction of AP. Rabbits were observed for 12 h. Serum amylase, lipase, TNF-alpha, IL-8, glucose, calcium and leukocyte count were measured every 3 h. At the end of the experimental period, ascitic fluid was collected and tissue specimens from the pancreas, lungs and kidney were obtained.Hydrocortisone pretreatment improved survival from 40 to 100%. Serum TNF-alpha and IL-8 were lower in the hydrocortisone group than in the control group at 6 h (p = 0.006 and p < 0.001, respectively). Hydrocortisone abolished leukopenia (p < 0. 001), hyperamylasemia (p = 0.05), the occurrence of acute lung injury and reduced the volume of ascites.Our findings suggest a role for TNF-alpha and IL-8 in mediating the progress of AP from a local disease into a systemic illness. Hydrocortisone should be tested experimentally after the induction of AP and clinically as a prophylactic measure to avoid severe AP induced by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography.
