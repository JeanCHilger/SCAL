Severe acute pancreatitis associated with hyperlipidemia: report of two cases and review of the literature in Japan. Two cases of severe acute pancreatitis associated with type V hyperlipoproteinemia are reported. A 39-year-old obese woman was hospitalized with continuous severe abdominal pain. The diagnosis was made on the day of admission to our hospital, and treatment using continuous regional arterial infusion of a protease inhibitor and an antibiotic was performed with good results. The other patient was a 35 year-old woman in the 35th week of pregnancy, and a diagnosis of gestational hyperlipidemic pancreatitis was made on the day of onset. She was treated supportively using intravenous hyperalimentation, protease inhibitors, and antibiotics. She recovered from the acute pancreatitis and delivered a healthy term infant. It is difficult to diagnose acute pancreatitis in patients with type V hyperlipoproteinemia, because even when serum amylase levels are high, the value is reduced by high serum triglycerides. Early diagnosis was achieved in both of the present cases, and early intensive therapy was performed, which may be of the utmost importance in saving the life of a patient.
