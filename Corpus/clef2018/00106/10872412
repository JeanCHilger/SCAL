Genetic predispositions to acute and chronic pancreatitis. Advances in molecular genetics have provided the powerful tools necessary to identify the key molecules and mechanisms that underly the disease process. Continued work in this area promises to reveal new insights as new disease genes are discovered. This article focuses on the insights into the cause of acute and chronic pancreatitis gained by investigation of the HP genes, the diagnosis of the known mutations, the fascinating observation of nonpenetrance, and a look at future directions.
