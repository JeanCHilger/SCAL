Early trypsinogen activation in acute pancreatitis. This article discusses zymogen activation within the acinar cell. The authors review advances in respect to the cellular mechanism involved in a premature intrapancreatic protease activation. Critical factors that determine the onset of premature protease activation appear to be the molecular structure of trypsinogen, the presence or absence of functionally intact lysosomal hydrolases, the pH in intracellular compartments, and the calcium signaling cascade in the pancreatic acinar cell.
