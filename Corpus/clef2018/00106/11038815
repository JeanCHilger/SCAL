Somastostatin and growth hormone in preventing liver damage due to acute necrotizing pancreatitis. To study the role of somastostatin and growth hormone in preventing liver damage due to ANP.The roles of inflammatory mediators (Endotoxin, Amylase, TNF alpha) were investigated in ANP model by retrograde injection of 3.5% sodium taurocholate 2.5 ml/kg into the pancreatic duct, and TNF alpha mRNA in the liver after ANP was observed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Besides, the effects of somastostain and growth hormone were also observed.ANP caused remarkable elevation of those inflammatory mediators, being positively correlated with the development of pancreas and liver damage. Somastostain and growth hormone inhibited the inflammatory mediates and TNF alpha mRNA overexpression and reduced the damage to the pancreas and liver.TNF alpha plays an important role in ANP progression, and somastostatin and growth hormone may prevent the development and progression of liver damage due to ANP.
