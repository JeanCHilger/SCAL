Serum amylase and lipase activities in normal pregnancy: a prospective case-control study. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis during pregnancy is usually based on the association of upper abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, and elevated serum amylase or lipase activities. The changes in these enzymatic activities have not been clearly established during normal pregnancy. The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate serum amylase and lipase activities in healthy pregnant women.Serum amylase and lipase activities were measured in 103 pregnant women (first trimester, n = 34 second trimester, n = 36Serum amylase activity was similar in pregnant women and nonpregnant women during all trimesters of pregnancy. Serum lipase activity was significantly lower during the first trimester of pregnancy compared to nonpregnant women (48.6+/-27.6 vs 59.2+/-29.3 IU/L, p < 0.05) and compared to the third trimester (48.6+/-27.6 vs 76.3+/-35.8 IU/L, p < 0.001). Serum lipase activity was not statistically different between pregnant and nonpregnant women during the second and third trimesters.An increase in serum amylase and lipase activities during pregnancy should be taken into account, as in nonpregnant women.
