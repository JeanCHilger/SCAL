Reticuloendothelial system blockade promotes progression from mild to severe acute pancreatitis in the opossum. To examine the relation between hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES) dysfunction and the development of acute biliary pancreatitis. In an opossum model, the authors tested the hypothesis that RES blockade can turn the mild pancreatitis seen after pancreatic duct obstruction (PDO) into the severe form.Biliary obstruction is considered the decisive event in gallstone pancreatitis. Suppression of the RES occurs during biliary obstruction.Eighteen opossums were placed into three groups of six animals each: group A, RES blockade with lambda-carrageenan group B, PDONo changes in hepatic blood flow occurred in groups A to C. RES capacity was suppressed in groups A and C in group B, RES function remained unchanged. In group A, amylase and lipase levels remained normal, 3 +/- 1.9% of pancreatic tissue were necrotic. The animals in group B developed mild edematous pancreatitis with an increase in amylase and lipase levels and 15 +/- 10% of pancreatic necrosis. In group C, amylase and lipase increased significantly and histology revealed severe necrotizing pancreatitis, with 72 +/- 11% of necrotic areas.Artificial RES blockade can promote the progression from mild pancreatitis as observed after PDO to the severe necrotizing form of the disease. Thus, RES dysfunction resulting from biliary obstruction might be an important cofactor in the pathogenesis of bile-induced pancreatitis.
