Involvement of lipid peroxidation in spontaneous pancreatitis in WBN/Kob rats. To cast light on the mechanisms underlying development of spontaneous pancreatitis lesions, tissues from WBN/Kob rats at various ages were histopathologically and immunohistochemically investigated with special reference to the existence of the lipid peroxidation products 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), 4-hydroxy-2-hexenal (HHE), and malondialdehyde (MDA). Male 4-20-week-old WBN/Kob rats were killed to allow sampling of pancreatic tissues, which were fixed in cold acetone and 10% neutral-buffered formalin. and then processed for routine histopathology as well as immunohistochemistry for proteins modified by HNE, HHE, and MDA. Although no remarkable histologic changes were noted in younger animals, edema, hemorrhage, inflammatory cell infiltration, fibrosis, vacuolation of acinar cells, and ductular proliferation were observed in exocrine pancreatic tissue from animals at 10-15 weeks of age. In animals aged 20 weeks, the lesions had progressed remarkably and deposits of hemosiderin were apparent with fibrosis. Immunohistochemical examination for lipid peroxidation product-modified proteins showed HNE and MDA to be negative in all pancreatic tissues, but HHE was positive in the areas involving atrophy of acinar cells and fibrosis in the islets. The results of the present study thus provide support for the conclusion that lipid peroxidation during spontaneous pancreatitis in WBN/Kob rats may possibly be involved in the development of diabetes in this model.
