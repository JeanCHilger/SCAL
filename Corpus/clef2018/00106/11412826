Severe hypertriglyceridemia with plasma inhibitory factor(s) on lipoprotein lipase activity in a patient with a common Ser(447)-Ter LPL mutation. Severe hypertriglyceridemia is a major risk for acute pancreatitis. So far, several mutations on the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene causing type I hyperlipidemia have been identified. However, the common mutation Ser(447)-Ter has been recently proposed to have a lowering effect on serum triglyceride concentrations in the general population. In this study, we analyzed blood from a patient suffering from severe hypertriglyceridemia and pancreatitis with the mutation on the lipoprotein lipase gene, Ser(447)-Ter. The patient's plasma showed inhibitory effects on the LPL activities from normal subjects. The bottom fraction separated by ultracentrifugation revealed enhanced effects as an inhibitory factor. The inhibitory effect observed in the bottom fraction was dose-dependent, stable at treatment of 65 degrees C for 30 min, and decreased significantly after being dialyzed using membranes with a cut-off molecular weight of 3500 or 6000 Da. The inhibitory effect was significantly higher when the post-heparin plasma was used from the patient or a subject with the same LPL mutation as an LPL source, compared to that from normal subjects. These results suggest that the patient has inhibitory factors in his plasma. Such inhibitory factors might cause severe hypertriglyceridemia in a case with the common mutation, which has been proposed to show the lowing effect on serum triglyceride concentrations in the general population.
