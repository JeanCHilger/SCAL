Pancreatic secretion of patients with chronic renal insufficiency (author's transl). Pancreatic function tests were performed in 15 patients with advanced renal insufficiency. Pancreatic secretion was stimulated with CCK/PZ and secretin and 60 minutes later with bile given intraduodenally and CCK/PZ and secretin intravenously. The Wilcoxon-test showed that there were significantly higher lipase levels in serum and lower amylase amounts in duodenal juice compared to normal volunteers. No differences could be demonstratd for volume, maximal bicarbonate concentration, lipase and trypsin outputs. It could be shown by nonlinear discriminant analysis that pancreatic secretion might specifically be changed in patients with chronic renal failure. These patients can be definitely differentiated according to the secretion pattern from normal controls and patients with chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic carcinoma, chronic and acute duodenal ulcer.
