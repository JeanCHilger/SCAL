A pathogenesis for alcoholic pancreatitis. Twelve patients with prior episodes of alcoholic pancreatitis and hyperlipemia were admitted to a metabolic ward during a quiescent period. By lipid feeding (316 to 894 Gm. per day), significant hypertriglyceridemia (greater than 600 mg. per 100 ml.) was induced in 11 of the 12 patients. Seven of the 11 patients with hypertriglyceridemia developed abdominal pain similar to but not as severe as that experienced during prior attacks of pancreatitis. Four of the seven patients with abdominal pain developed serum amylase elevations, and, of the remaining three, one had a serum lipase elevation and one a urinary amylase elevation. Alcohol ingestion is known to increase serum triglyceride levels in many individuals. A prior study demonstrated that 41 percent of the patients presenting to our hospital with alcoholic pancreatitis had serum triglyceride elevations. The data from the present study suggest that increased serum triglycerides act as an important intermediary in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis in some alcoholic patients.
