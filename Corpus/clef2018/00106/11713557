Free radical oxidation and activity of enzymes catalyzing biotransformation of xenobiotics in the liver of rats with experimental acute pancreatitis. The development of experimental acute pancreatitis in rats was accompanied by intensification of lipid peroxidation, activation of superoxide dismutase and glutathione reductase, inhibition of glutathione transferase, and deceleration of aniline N-hydroxylation by cytochrome P-450 in the liver. Antioxidants inhibited lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzymes, but did not prevent inhibition of detoxifying enzymes.
