Plasmapheresis in the treatment of an acute pancreatitis due to protease inhibitor-induced hypertriglyceridemia. The use of protease inhibitors such as ritonavir to treat HIV-infected individuals has been associated with lipodystrophy, combined hyperlipidemias, and hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis. We report here on the treatment by plasmapheresis of a HIV-patient who presented with a rapid onset of severe ritonavir-induced hypertriglyceridemia complicated with an acute pancreatitis. A 35-year-old HIV-1 positive male following 3 weeks of ritonavir treatment presented with nausea, abdominal pain, a distended abdomen, and the following laboratory values: amylase (238 U/L), lipase (864 U/L), total cholesterol (27.1 mmol/L), and triglycerides (62.9 mmol/L). Following two plasmaphereses, the levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, lipase, and amylase declined drastically and the patient was discharged home after 4 days with lipid and pancreatic enzyme levels within the reference range. To our knowledge, this is the first case of pancreatitis due to a PI-induced hyperlipidemia in a HIV-patient treated with plasmapheresis in an acute setting.
