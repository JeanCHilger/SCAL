Enzymatic and histological alterations in the isolated perfused rat pancreas in the taurocholate and cerulein model of acute pancreatitis. The pancreas of 24 male Wistar rats was perfused extracoporally by modified Krebs-Ringer-buffer for 80 minutes (including a 20 minutes equilibration period). To verify any organ damage we measured the activity of pancreatic enzymes like amylase, lipase and lactatdehydrogenase in the portal effluent. Furthermore histological changes were analysed after perfusion. Organ damage was induced by adding cerulein in a physiological dose (10(-10) M, n = 6) and in a supramaximal dose (10(-8) M, n = 6) and by intraductal injection of taurocholate (3.5 %, n = 6).Already 10 minutes after stimulation with cerulein (10(-8) M) and after intraductal injection of taurocholate increased activities (p < 0.01) of amylase and lipase were measured in the portal effluent compared to the group without any treatment. Lactatdehydrogenase levels did not changed. Apart from marked oedema in both groups considerable zones of necrosis could be noticed especially in the taurocholate group.Our data suggest that the isolated perfused rat pancreas (IPRP) is a valuable experimental tool to verify pathophysiological changes in the early phase of acute pancreatitis (AP). Various established models of AP such as by cerulein hyperstimulation or intraductal injection of taurocholate, could be applied to the IPRP. We conclude that this method enlarges the spectrum of established experimental models of acute pancreatitis.
