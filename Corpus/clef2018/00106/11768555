Current insights into the pathogenesis of acute and chronic pancreatitis. For a long time the pathogenesis of pancreatitis has remained enigmatic. Recent developments in cellular and molecular biology, however, have provided a tremendous research impetus and some of its mysteries are finally being disclosed. This review discusses the implications of the discovery of the disease gene in hereditary pancreatitis and outlines recent advances in our understanding of the mechanism and site of trypsinogen activation and the role of immunocytes and cytokines in acute pancreatitis. With respect to chronic pancreatitis, this review focuses on its association with mutations in the cystic fibrosis conductance regulator gene and the mechanisms of pancreatic fibrosis. These advances in our knowledge of the pathogenesis of the disease, together with emerging biotechnological techniques, will boost the development of future therapies aimed at strategically targeting key pathophysiological processes involved in acute and chronic pancreatitis.
