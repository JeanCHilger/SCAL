Pancreatic involvement in inflammatory bowel diseases in children. Pancreatitis in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children is anecdotal. In adults, symptomatic pancreatitis occurs in 2% and asymptomatic in 8 to 21%.The aim of our study was to review retrospectively the frequency of pancreatitis in 124 pediatric patients (54.8% boys, 45.2% girls 97 with Crohn disease, 16 with ulcerative colitis and 11 with undetermined colitis). Diagnostic criterion of pancreatitis was an increase of amylasemia > or = +2 SD of the normal with or without evocative clinical symptoms.Symptomatic or asymptomatic pancreatitis was found in 27% (respectively 14.5 and 12.5%). Pancreatitis was significantly more frequent in girls as compared to boys (P = 0.04). Symptomatic pancreatitis was moderate and non complicated, often recurrent. It occurred mainly during active and severe diseases (P = 0.006). The localizations of IBD were not discriminant. Strong relation with drug was found in 25% of pancreatitis mainly due to azathioprine or 5-aminosalicylic acid, and salazopyrin. Duodenal localisation of Crohn disease or hepatobiliary complications were found associated with pancreatitis in 18% and 15% respectively.These data suggest the high incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic pancreatitis in children with IBD, the importance of its regular monitoring but also its multifactorial causes. Precise diagnosis of pancreatitis in pediatric IBD has to be done in order to avoid inappropriate drug pancreatitis diagnosis.
