Reference intervals for procalcitonin and C-reactive protein after major abdominal surgery. Procalcitonin (PCT). a new marker proposed as a diagnostic tool for bacterial infections, triggers a systemic-inflammatory reaction in the body (sepsis, septic shock) and has potential use in a wide range of patient settings. To interpret the results from PCT measurements, we depend on reference intervals established from relevant populations. PCT and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations were analysed in 47 patients with a normal postoperative course after major abdominal surgery. The mean concentration of PCT declines from the first day and reaches half its initial values on the second day after the operation. whereas the mean concentration of CRP increases in the first 48 h and reaches half its maximum value on the fifth day after the operation. We present a continuous reference interval for plasma PCT and CRP concentrations in the first week following major abdominal surgery. For PCT we also present a graphic display of expected mean and expected upper reference limits predicted from the value measured on the first postoperative day.
