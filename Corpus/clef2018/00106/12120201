Fatal outcome in acute pancreatitis: its occurrence and early prediction. This study aims to determine predictability of death in acute pancreatitis at a secondary-care hospital in Germany.This study is part of an ongoing study on the epidemiology of acute pancreatitis and covers 368 patients with a first attack of acute pancreatitis in LÃ¼neburg county from 1988 to 1999. Early and late mortality were defined as < or = 1 weeks and > 1 week after admission. The following parameters were used to establish on admission likelihood of death: admission within 24 h or later with an acute attack, abdominal tenderness, signs of peritonitis, amylase and lipase in serum, leukocytes, hematocrit, potassium, sodium, calcium, creatinine after rehydration, blood glucose, bilirubin, serum glutamate-oxalacetate transaminase (SGOT), serum lactate dehydrogenase (SLDH), arterial pO2, APACHE II score, Ranson and Imrie scores.Of the 368 patients 17 (5%) died, 7 early because of multiple organ failure and 10 late because of septic complications. Mortality rates in interstitial and necrotising pancreatitis were 3 and 17%, respectively. Only an elevated serum creatinine (> 2.0 mg/dl) and a blood glucose > 250 mg significantly correlated with mortality. Ranson and Imrie scores were also significantly correlated with mortality however, they were not obtained on admission, but only after 48 h. In univariate analysis, APACHE II score > or = 6 on admission and lipase > 1,000 U/l on admission provided a high sensitivity and negative predictive value for early and late mortality patients.Approximately half of the deaths in acute pancreatitis occur because of multiple organ failure or septic complications. New approaches have to be found to counteract these severe complications. A fatal outcome may be predicted by simple laboratory parameters such as a high serum creatinine and blood glucose. An APACHE II score > or = 6 and a lipase level on admission > or = 1,000 U/l indicate severe pancreatitis.
