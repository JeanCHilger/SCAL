Cholecystokinin antagonist L364,718 induces alterations in acinar cells that prevent improvement of acute pancreatitis induced by obstruction. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of the most potent CCK receptor antagonist, L364,718, on two major factors involved in pancreatitis development: enzyme load and cytosolic calcium (Ca2+) levels in acinar cells. L364,718 (0.1 mg/kg/12 hr) was administered from 30 min before inducing acute pancreatitis (AP) by pancreatic duct obstruction (PDO) for 48 hr. The results obtained at different AP stages in PDO rats treated and not treated with the CCK antagonist were compared. Similar increases in the intracellular enzyme content were found at earlier stages of pancreatitis in all PDO rats treated or not treated with L364,718. The CCK antagonist increased cytosolic Ca2+ levels up to 6 hr after administration, inducing a higher cytosolic Ca2+ overload at the earliest stages of pancreatitis in L364,718-treated PDO rats than in those not treated. This event might justify the higher increases in ascites volume and haematocrit found in PDO rats treated with L364,718 and the exacerbation in pancreatic morphological alterations induced by PDO. The CCK receptor antagonist L364,718 produces alterations in the acinar calcium homeostasis that prevent to reduction in the severity of pancreatitis induced by obstruction.
