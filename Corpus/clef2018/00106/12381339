Effect of glutamine-enriched total parenteral nutrition in patients with acute pancreatitis. The management of acute pancreatitis (AP) frequently includes parenteral nutrition, but conditionally essential amino acids such as glutamine are not included in conventional total parenteral nutrition (TPN).This study was conducted to determine whether the inclusion of glutamine has a beneficial effect in patients with AP receiving TPN.In a randomized, controlled study 28 patients with AP received either a standard TPN with 1.5 g/kg body weight protein or an isonitrogen, isocaloric TPN which contains 0.3 g/kg L -alanine- L -glutamine. Patients were assessed for nutritional and inflammatory parameters, infectious complications, length of TPN, length of hospital stay (LOS) and cost of TPN.There were no side-effects related to glutamine substitution observed. Glutamine was associated with a significant increase of cholinesterase, albumin and lymphocyte count in AP as well a decrease of C-reactive protein compared to standard TPN at day 14. There was a reduced length of TPN (10 [6-16] vs 16 [10-18] days, P<0.05) and a trend of reduced LOS (21 [14-32] vs 25 [19-40] days) in AP patients receiving glutamine. The overall cost per patient for TPN did not differ (gln+: 929+/-586 vs gln-: 981+/-507 euro/patient).Our results suggest that glutamine substitution is beneficial and does not increase the overall cost of parenteral feeding in patients with acute pancreatitis.
