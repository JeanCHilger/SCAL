Do normal leucocyte count and C-reactive protein on admission to hospital exclude a life-threatening attack of acute pancreatitis? The early severity assessment of an attack of acute pancreatitis is clinically of utmost importance. The aim of the present work was to study the role of leucocyte count and C-reactive protein (CRP) measurements on admission to hospital in assessing the severity of an attack of acute pancreatitis. In particular, patients with a life-threatening attack of acute pancreatitis but a normal leucocyte count and CRP level were sought.A total of 1050 attacks of acute pancreatitis were treated at Turku University Central Hospital during the years 1995-1999. Leucocyte count and C-reactive protein (CRP) value were determined on admission to hospital. There were 58 life-threatening attacks of acute pancreatitis (group A). Fifty-eight consecutive mild attacks served as controls (group B). The number of patients with both values normal, only leucocyte count raised, only CRP level raised and both values raised were calculated in the groups A and B.Both leucocyte count and CRP level were significantly (P < 0.001 in both comparisons) higher on admission to hospital in patients with a life-threatening disease (group A) than in those with a mild disease (group B). Group A contained no patients with both values in the normal range. In group B, one fifth of the patients had both values normal.It is very unlikely that acute pancreatitis proves to be a life-threatening one when both the leucocyte count and CRP are normal on admission to hospital. In the present 1050 acute pancreatitis there were no patients with life-threatening disease but normal laboratory values on admission.
