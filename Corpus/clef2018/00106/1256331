Comparison between a titrimetric and a photometric method for determination of serum lipase activity (author's transl). Comparative studies of two methods for the determination of serum lipase activity (SLA) in human serum show in both methods, the one titrimetric the other photometric, a comparable sensivity and comparable results, especially within the group of subjects suffering from pancreactic diseases. The values of SLA within the group of 45 patients with acute and chronic pancreatic diseases and within a control group of 39 persons without pancreatic affections show a marked correlation for each group. The values of SLA obtained with the titrimetric method of Rick are found to be higher, which would be due to better conditions of the procedure. Also in the study of precision the titrimetric method gave a better result. The determination of SLA with both methods includes post-heparin-lipase-activity (PHLA).
