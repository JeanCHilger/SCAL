The alteration of inflammatory cytokine during acute pancreatitis. To observe the alteration of both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines during acute pancreatitis, and to investigate the effect of somatostatin on modulation of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in experimental acute pancreatitis.SD male rats were divided into 3 groups: group 1. the normal rats as control (n = 6) group 2, the rats with acute pancreatitis induced by transabdominal injection of 5% sodium cholate sulfur (at the volume of 1.0 ml/kg) into the parcreatic duct and not given drug treatmentSerum IL-1, TNF alpha, IL-6, IL-10 and TGF-beta in control group were 0.56 +/- 0.06 ng/ml, 23.50 +/- 1.87 IU/ml, 69.0 +/- 6.40 IU/ml, 32.05 +/- 14.87 pg/ml and 66.4 +/- 13.20 pg/ml, respectively. After acute pancreatitis was induced, the serum level of these inflammation-concerned cytokines increased significantly in group 2 (P < 0.05). Serum IL-1, TNF alpha, IL-6, IL-10 and TGF-beta in group 2 at 24 hours after pancreatitis were 1.15 +/- 0.13 ng/ml, 55.33 +/- 12.79 IU/ml. 127.17 +/- 13.91 IU/ml, 68.13 +/- 19.90 pg/ml, and 103.77 +/- 28.95 pg/ml, respectively. After administration of somatostatin, the inflammation-concerned cytokines in group 3 were remarkably decreased (P < 0.05). Serum IL-1, TNF alpha, IL-6, IL-10 and TGF-beta in group 3 were 0.83 +/- 0.12 ng/ml, 33.00 +/- 7.40 IU/ml. 71.83 +/- 6.34 IU/ml, 42.2 +/- 14.55 pg/ml, and 45.98 +/- 18.10 pg/ml, respectively. The indeies of the severity of pancreatitis, such as amylase and the weight of pancreas alse improved in group 3.Both inflammatory and antiinflammatory cytokines increased remarkably in the rats with acute pancreatitis. This result indicates that there is a potential tendency of inflammatory response syndrome and compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome in the course of acute pancreatitis. Somatostatin can modulate the derangement of these cytokines in acute pancreatitis.
