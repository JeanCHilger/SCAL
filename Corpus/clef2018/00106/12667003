Preparation and characterization of reference materials for human pancreatic lipase: BCR 693 (from human pancreatic juice) and BCR 694 (recombinant). There is a lack of certified reference material (CRM) for lipase catalytic activity. Consequently between-method comparability is very poor. The aim of this study was to produce two lipase CRMs, one from human pancreatic juice (BCR 693), and another using recombinant technologies (BCR 694). Lipase was purified from pancreatic juice, using column chromatography and isoelectric focusing. Recombinant lipase was produced with a transfected cell line and purified with column chromatography. Adding buffered bovine serum albumin and subsequent freeze-drying were used to stabilize both materials. A standardized titrimetric method was employed to compare their catalytic properties to those of two plasma pools of patients suffering from acute pancreatitis. About 5 kU (titrimetry, 37 degrees C) of each material were obtained. They were lyophilized without apparent modifications of their catalytic properties, which stayed identical to those exhibited by the enzyme present in patient's pools. Stability of both materials was estimated at several years when stored in a dry form at -20 degrees C. Both materials appear to have similar catalytic properties and stability and were found commutable as regards a reference method and a routine measurement procedure. An international certification campaign will be carried out to assign values to BCR 693 and BCR 694.
