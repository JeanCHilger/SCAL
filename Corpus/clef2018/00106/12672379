Ultrasonographic imaging of experimentally induced pancreatitis in cattle. This study was conducted to determine the ultrasonographic patterns of pancreatitis evoked in cattle, with reference to laboratory and pathological findings. Using ultrasonographic guidance, acute necrotizing pancreatitis was induced in six cows by injecting chloroform into the pancreatic tissue. Ultrasonographic examination was then performed once daily for nine days. Pancreatic lesions were visible 24h after induction of pancreatitis, as represented by a uniform increase in echogenicity and by intralobular and subcapsular fluid accumulation. As the experiment progressed, patchy hypoechogenic foci appeared within the gland parenchyma. Amylase and lipase activities showed rapid increases. Post mortem examination revealed gross and microscopic necrotic and haemorrhagic lesions in the body and right lobe of the pancreas, accompanied by oedema and fibrosis. Ultrasonography was found to be extremely useful for the detection and characterization of experimentally induced pancreatitis and to monitor its progression in the cow. These findings are of potential value as a reference for the diagnostic workup of bovine pancreatitis, and ultrasonography is seen as a promising non-invasive technique for the diagnosis of suspected pancreatitis in cattle.
