Upper digestive hemorrhage in acute pancreatitis. We proposed to investigate the following parameters regarding upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurring in the patients with acute pancreatitis: incidence, form of manifestation, severity, correlated to the clinical and morpho-pathological form of acute pancreatitis, cause (direct causality or morbid association). The study was carried out on the inpatients of the internal-medicine and surgery units over a period of one year. For sake of accuracy the study also included the cases submitted to necropsy over a period of 5 years. The practical experience has revealed that though gastrointestinal bleeding is not a frequent complication--9.1% in the patients with acute pancreatitis and 36.3% of the necropsied cases--it is often severe, which imposes the early recognition for its adequate management.
