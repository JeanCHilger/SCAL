Chronic intragastric alcohol exposure causes hypoxia and oxidative stress in the rat pancreas. The effect of chronic enteral ethanol on pancreatic hypoxia was investigated using the hypoxia marker, pimonidazole. Male Wistar rats were fed an ethanol-containing diet for 3 weeks using an enteral model shown to cause pancreatic damage pimonidazole (120 mg/kg i.v.) was injected 1h before sacrifice. Pimonidazole and 4-hydroxynonenal (an index of lipid peroxidation) adducts were detected immunochemically. Breathing air with low oxygen content (8% O(2)) for 1h increased pimonidazole adduct accumulation approximately 2-fold in pancreata of nai
