Effects of the S2-serotonergic receptor antagonist, ketanserin, on cerulein-induced pancreatitis in the rat. We investigated the effects of ketanserin, a S 2 (5-hydroxytryptamine 2 5-HT 2)-serotonergic receptor antagonist, on cerulein-induced pancreatitis in the rat. Large pharmacological doses of cerulein induced acute pancreatitis in the rat. Ketanserin reduced the cerulein-induced increase in serum amylase concentration in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment with 10 mg/kg of ketanserin per os markedly improved cerulein-induced pancreatitis and was associated with a significant reduction of the increase in serum amylase concentration. In addition, a very specific serotonin S 2 antagonist, ritanserin which has no antihypertensive effect, also reduced the cerulein-induced increase in the serum amylase concentration. These results suggest that S 2 (5-HT 2) may play a role in pathophysiology of cerulein-induced pancreatitis in the rat.
