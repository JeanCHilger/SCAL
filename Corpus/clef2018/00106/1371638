Hyperamylasemia in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Marked elevations of serum amylase, unexplained despite extensive evaluation in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), prompted this retrospective review of 85 patients to determine the prevalence of hyperamylasemia and identify any associated demographic and etiologic factors. Of 39 patients who had amylase determinations, 54% had hyperamylasemia (2/3 pancreatic, 1/3 salivary) and 31% had pancreatitis. Biliary tract disease, alcohol intake, and opportunistic infections were similar in hyperamylasemic and normoamylasemic subjects. Non-Caucasian race, intravenous drug abuse, renal dysfunction, alkaline phosphatase elevation, and pentamidine use were more prevalent in patients with hyperamylasemia (p less than 0.001, p less than 0.001, p less than 0.01, p less than 0.05, and p less than 0.05, respectively). However, by stepwise deletion multiple regression analysis, only non-Caucasian race, pentamidine use, and Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare infection were significant, independent predictors of hyperamylasemia (R2 = 0.65). Followed over time, in a historical prospective manner, case fatality rates (66.6% and 61.1%) and median survival times (101 and 84 days) were similar in the hyperamylasemic and normoamylasemic groups. We conclude that, although pancreatitis occurs frequently in AIDS, hyperamylasemia is often of salivary origin and clinical outcome is unaffected. Certain demographic factors are strongly associated with hyperamylasemia in AIDS patients, but multiple, concurrent, etiologic factors are probably operative in these patients.
