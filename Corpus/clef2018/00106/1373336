Serum pancreatic enzyme assays in acute abdomen: a comparative prospective study. Serum amylase, pancreatic isoamylase, lipase, trypsinogen and elastase-1 were measured in 100 consecutive patients who were emergency admissions to a surgical department, and in 27 selected patients with proven acute pancreatitis who served as controls. The final diagnoses in the 100 patients of the study group were: acute pancreatitis in eight patients, other digestive diseases in 87, and urogenital tract diseases in five. In the control group, pancreas-specific enzymes were abnormally high in all patients and amylase in 26 out of 27. In the study group, all enzymes were markedly high in all eight patients with acute pancreatitis. In the remaining 92 patients, serum amylase was abnormally high in seven, and at least one pancreatic enzyme was elevated in 16. These elevations were generally mild. The diagnostic efficiency, i.e., the percentage of patients correctly classified, was 96% for pancreatic isoamylase and lipase, 93% for amylase, 91% for elastase-1, and 84% for trypsinogen. We conclude that serum lipase turbidimetric assay is the most suitable test for emergency diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, because it is highly sensitive and specific and simply and quickly performed.
