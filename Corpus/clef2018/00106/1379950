Functional changes of the exocrine perfused rat pancreas in cerulein-induced pancreatitis. Functional changes of the exocrine pancreas in cerulein-induced pancreatitis were evaluated with the isolated perfused rat pancreas. In control specimens (n = 7), baseline pancreatic juice volume was 0.23 +/- 0.06 microliter/min and after stimulation with CCK-8 (10(-10) M) and secretin (10(-10) M), it was 2.26 +/- 0.45 microliter/min, and in cerulein-induced pancreatitis specimens (n = 8), the corresponding values were 0.11 +/- 0.03 and 0.23 +/- 0.08 microliter/min. The amylase content in the pancreatic juice (IU/min) was 0.73 +/- 0.15 (baseline) and 7.03 +/- 1.66 (stimulated) in the control specimens, and 0.012 +/- 0.002 (baseline) 0.018 +/- 0.004 (stimulated), in the cerulein-induced pancreatitis specimens. Amylase and lipase concentrations in the portal effluents were significantly higher in the cerulein-induced pancreatitis (481.3 +/- 79.4 IU/ml, 283.7 +/- 47.2 BALB U/ml) than in the control specimens (10.7 +/- 1.8 IU/ml, 8.9 +/- 2.9 BALB U/ml). Using the electron microscope fusion of large vacuoles with lateral plasma membrane was observed in cerulein-induced pancreatitis. In cerulein-induced pancreatitis, normal secretion was markedly decreased, and the lateral secretion was suggested to result in the elevation of pancreatic enzyme levels in portal effluents.
