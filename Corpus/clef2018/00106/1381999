Macroamylases: differences in activity against various-sized substrates. Hyperamylasemia caused by macroamylases can lead to the overdiagnosis of acute pancreatitis. We examined whether interference from macroamylase is less in assays that use high-molecular-mass (high-M(r)) substrates rather than oligosaccharide substrates. We hypothesized that high-M(r) substrates would be sterically excluded from macroamylasemic complexes and thus would be hydrolyzed less efficiently. Eighteen macroamylasemic samples were assayed by using red-dyed amylopectin or blue-dyed starch as polysaccharide substrates or by using maltoheptaose or maltotetraose as oligosaccharide substrates. The oligosaccharide substrates gave comparable results (y = 0.81x + 83), but we observed consistently lower activities for amylopectin than for maltotetraose (y = 0.32x + 38). We observed no bias among methods when nonmacroamylasemic specimens were analyzed. The mechanism of this difference was examined by adding antihuman pancreatic amylase antibodies to hyperamylasemic serum samples from patients without macroamylasemia and to purified human pancreatic or salivary isoamylases. In each case, polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies lowered amylase activity more in assays with complex polysaccharides than in those with oligosaccharides. The use of high-M(r) substrates diminishes interference, and detection of suspected macroamylasemia may be possible through comparing activities determined from automated methods that use different substrates.
