Altered systemic and tissue prostacyclin in cerulein induced acute pancreatitis in rats. Prostacyclin metabolism in rat acute pancreatitis was evaluated by measuring the tissue levels of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha) and the urinary excretion of 2, 3-dinor 6-keto-PGF1 alpha. Acute pancreatitis was induced by i.v. cerulein perfusion and was confirmed by the pancreas enzyme changes and the histological findings. Significantly enhanced tissue and urinary prostacyclin levels were found in acute pancreatitis rats, when compared to the controls. Concomitantly, an enhanced tissue phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity was also found. These data show the importance of 2, 3-dinor PGF1 alpha as an inflammatory marker in cerulein-induced pancreatitis.
