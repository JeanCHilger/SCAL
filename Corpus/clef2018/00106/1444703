Protective effect of prostaglandin E2 on cerulein-induced rat pancreatitis. In order to clarify the effect of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) on cerulein-induced rat pancreatitis, we investigated the interaction of PGE2 with cerulein or secretin. Intravenous infusion of 10 micrograms/kg.h cerulein inhibited external secretion of the pancreas from one hour and caused macroscopic edema at 3 hours. Administration of PGE2 relieved the inhibitory effect of supramaximal dose of cerulein and decreased the pancreatic edema. The 100 micrograms/kg.hr PGE2 had no significant effect on the pancreatic juice volume and amylase secretion stimulated with 0.2 micrograms/kg.hr of cerulein. Intravenous injection of 100 micrograms/kg PGE2 inhibited both the volume and amylase secretion of pancreatic juice stimulated with 1 U/kg.h of secretin. The protective effect of PGE2 on cerulein-induced pancreatitis was not the stimulation on secretion but caused the cytoprotective effect of PG such as stabilization of cytoplasmic and lysosomal membrane.
