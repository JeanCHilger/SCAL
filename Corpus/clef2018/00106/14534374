Experimental model of obstructive, chronic pancreatitis in pigs. We aimed to develop a reproducible, experimental model of obstructive pancreatitis for future analysis of surgical interventions, and characterized this model using functional, histological and biochemical parameters.In 10 female pigs the pancreatic duct (PD) was ligated. After 4, 6 or 8 weeks the animals were sacrificed. Before and after ligation, glucose tolerance and intraductal pressure were measured, and pancreatic juice was collected after stimulation with cholecystokinin and secretin. Amylase and lipase activities were analyzed in plasma and juice. Pancreatic tissue was collected for histochemical analysis.Within 4 weeks of ligation, the pancreas appeared atrophic. Intraductal pressure had risen significantly. Acinar-to-ductal metaplasia was accompanied by strong proliferation of stellate cells and increased collagen deposition. Islets of Langerhans appeared smaller and more numerous. Blood amylase and lipase levels were normal and glucose tolerance was unaffected. Pancreatic juice volume and amylase and lipase activities were significantly lower.Ligation of the PD in pigs resulted in a marked fibrosing obstructive pancreatitis within 4 weeks, similar to human chronic pancreatitis in regard to clinical, functional, histological and biochemical parameters.
