Pancreatitis in children. To determine the incidence, etiology and outcome of pancreatitis at a regional children's hospital.Chart review of all patients with pancreatitis seen during a 6 year period at the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin. The diagnosis of pancreatitis required either a serum amylase or lipase >3 times normal or radiographic evidence of pancreatitis.Two hundred fourteen episodes of pancreatitis in 180 patients were documented. The most common etiologies were systemic disease (14%), trauma (14%), drug induced (12%), biliary tract disease (12%), infectious (8%), and idiopathic (8%), which made up 68% of the total cases. Eleven patients died, all from underlying systemic illnesses. The serum amylase and lipase were elevated in 82% and 83% of patients respectively.Pancreatitis is more common in children than previously thought. Upon careful assessment fewer cases were found to be idiopathic than in previous series. The outcome of pancreatitis depends on co-morbid conditions.
