A case of acute pancreatitis due to Weil's disease. Leptospirosis, the most common vasculitic zoonosis in the world, is characterized with jaundice and acute renal failure. However, pancreatitis is an uncommon complication of leptospirosis. In this report, an acute pancreatitis case due to Weil's disease has been presented. A 31-year-old female patient with high levels of glucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, creatine kinase, bilirubin, amylase and lipase, has been diagnosed to have leptospirosis by the high positive result (1/800) of microscopic agglutination test against Leptospira interrogans serogroup icterohemorrhagiae. The patient has been treated with supportive and symptomatic therapy, and with penicillin G for leptospirosis. Following triple hemodialysis, all the blood biochemistry tests returned to normal on the tenth day of therapy. This case was reported to draw attention to Leptospira infections which should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with jaundice and pancreatitis.
