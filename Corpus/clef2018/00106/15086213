Effect of octreotide administration on serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels of patients with acute edematous pancreatitis. Based on former studies in experimental animals on the effect of octreotide on serum and ascitic levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 in the field of necrotizing pancreatitis, the present study was designed to investigate the effect of octreotide on serum interleukin-6 of patients with acute edematous pancreatitis.A total of 36 patients with acute edematous pancreatitis and initiation of symptoms 12 hours before their admission were enrolled in the study 20 were treated with octreotide 200 microg tid and 16 with octreotide 500 microg tid for five days. Blood was sampled at regular time intervals. Interleukin-6 was determined by an enzyme-immunoassay and C-reactive protein by nephelometry.Mean concentrations of interleukin-6 of patients treated with octreotide 200 microg tid were 59.52 pg/mL before and 94.08, 46.25, 49.94, 58.16 and 26.08 pg/mL at 3, 6, 24, 48 and 72 hours after the start of therapy respectively. Respective values of patients treated with octreotide 500 microg tid were 57.19, 53.07, 57.83, 36.06, 54.29 and 65.49 pg/mL. Mean C-reactive protein of patients treated with octreotide 200 microg tid were 67.37 mg/L before and 48.51, 106.08 and 95.58 mg/L at 24, 48 and 72 hours after the start of therapy respectively. Respective values of patients treated with octreotide 500 microg tid were 65.51, 60.56, 90.68 and 64.22 mg/L.A transient, but not statistically significant, decrease of serum interleukin-6 levels was documented after administration of octreotide in the field of acute edematous pancreatitis. That decrease was earlier after the application of the 500 microg tid dose than the 200 microg tid dose. Studies with a greater number of patients are mandatory to fully clarify the effect of octreotide, if any, on acute pancreatitis.
