The value of Ranson and APACHE II scoring systems, and serum levels of interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein in the early diagnosis of the severity of acute pancreatitis. We investigated the effectiveness of scoring systems, acute inflammation and acute phase responses in the early diagnosis of the severity of acute pancreatitis.In a prospective design, we determined Ranson and APACHE II scores, and serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in 30 patients (21 females, 9 males mean age 56 yearsSevere pancreatitis was diagnosed in six patients (20%), one of whom died due to multiple organ failure. Biliary symptoms were the most common presenting signs in both groups. The mean Ranson (p=0.004) and APACHE II (p=0.001) scores, serum IL-6 (p=0.001) and CRP levels at 24, 48, and 72 hours (p=0.02) were significantly high in patients with severe pancreatitis. The sensitivity was found as 66.6%, 83.3%, 100%, and 83.3% the specificity as 87.5%, 91.7%, 87.5% and 71%Ranson and APACHE II scores, CRP and, in particular, serum IL-6 levels are strong predictors of severe pancreatitis.
