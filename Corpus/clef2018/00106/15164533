Acute pancreatitis associated with acute hepatitis E infection. A 45-year-old male presented with severe abdominal pain, hyperamylasaemia and a bulky pancreas. In addition, he had deep jaundice and markedly raised serum transaminases, and his serum was positive for IgM anti-hepatitis E virus (HEV) antibodies. The common aetiologies of acute pancreatitis were excluded. The patient ran a benign course for both acute viral hepatitis and acute pancreatitis, and recovered completely. Acute pancreatitis caused by HEV infection has been reported only occasionally.
