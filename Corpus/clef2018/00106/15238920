Pancreatic enzyme elevations in children with diabetic ketoacidosis. The incidence of pancreatic enzyme elevations in children with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) compared with children with newly diagnosed diabetes without DKA was assessed in a prospective study. Pancreatic enzyme elevations, particularly hyperlipasemia, are common but not associated with significant symptomatology. Acute pancreatitis was diagnosed in 2% of children with DKA.
