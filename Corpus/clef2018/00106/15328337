Reduction of the multiple organ injury and dysfunction caused by endotoxemia in 5-lipoxygenase knockout mice and by the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor zileuton. The role of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) in the pathophysiology of the organ injury/dysfunction caused by endotoxin is not known. Here, we investigate the effects of treatment with 5-LOX inhibitor zileuton in rats and targeted disruption of the 5-LOX gene in mice (5-LOX(-/-)) on multiple organ injury/dysfunction caused by severe endotoxemia. We also investigate the expression of beta2-integrins CD11a/CD18 and CD11b/CD18 on rat leukocytes by flow cytometry. Zileuton [3 mg/kg intravenously (i.v.)] or vehicle (10% dimethyl sulfoxide) was administered to rats 15 min prior to lipopolysaccharide (LPS Escherichia coli, 6 mg/kg i.v.) or vehicle (saline). 5-LOX(-/-) mice and wild-type littermate controls were treated with LPS (E. coli, 20 mg/kg intraperitoneally) or vehicle (saline). Endotoxemia for 6 h in rats or 16 h in mice resulted in liver injury/dysfunction (increase in the serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin), renal dysfunction (creatinine), and pancreatic injury (lipase, amylase). Absence of functional 5-LOX (zileuton treatment or targeted disruption of the 5-LOX gene) reduced the multiple organ injury/dysfunction caused by endotoxemia. Polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration (myeloperoxidase activity) in the lung and ileum as well as pulmonary injury (histology) were markedly reduced in 5-LOX(-/-) mice. Zileuton also reduced the LPS-induced expression of CD11b/CD18 on rat leukocytes. We propose that endogenous 5-LOX metabolites enhance the degree of multiple organ injury/dysfunction caused by severe endotoxemia by promoting the expression of the adhesion molecule CD11b/CD18 and that inhibitors of 5-LOX may be useful in the therapy of the organ injury/dysfunction associated with endotoxic shock.
