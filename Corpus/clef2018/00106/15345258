A case of hypertriglycideremia-induced pancreatitis in pregnancy: value of heparin. We report the case of a 28-year-old secundipari with a history of severe hypertriglycideremia-induced pancreatitis 3 years ago who was admitted in the 37th week of gestation with abdominal pain. A blood sample had a milky aspect and plasma concentrations were as follows: triglycerides 8,5g/l, cholesterol 1000 mg/dl, amylase 574 IU/l, lipase 1310 IU/l. Acute pancreatitis was diagnosed, a caesarean was performed under spinal anaesthesia. The diagnosis was confirmed by CT-scan. Treatment with 15,000 IU heparin per day and intravenous nutrition decreased triglycerides level to less than 1g/l within 48 h. She was discharged 28 days later. Heparin could be a low-cost alternative to plasmapheresis in hypertriglycideremia-induced pancreatitis.
