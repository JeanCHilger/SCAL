Patient with left-sided pleural effusion and large structures of soft-tissue-density in the mediastinum. A patient was admitted to the hospital to clarifying a left-sided pleural effusion. Typical cytological findings in pleural effusion did not leave a doubt about being present a pancreatitis in conformity with clearly increased levels of lipase and amylase in the effusion fluid. The CT of the upper abdomen showed signs of a exsudative pancreatitis. In the chest CT as well as in transesophageal ultrasound evaluation large structures of soft-tissue-density together with areas of encapsulated fluid were seen in the dorsal mediastinum reaching down to the diaphragm and abdomen. Just with subsequent diet and strict termination of any alcohol consumption the pathological findings recovered completely. Due to the expansive involvement of the pleural, mediastinal and abdominal compartments this is an extraordinary case of acute pancreatitis.
