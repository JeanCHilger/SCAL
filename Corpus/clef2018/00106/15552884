Role of apoptosis in severe acute pancreatitis. The role of apoptosis in a severe acute pancreatitis is recently given the most attention, but it is hardly known in a clinical study. We show three assumptions between apoptosis and the pathophysiological mechanisms of severe acute pancreatitis in this paragraph. First, the apoptosis of pancreatic acinar cell might prevent from a worsening in acute pancreatitis due to diminish leakage of pancreatic enzyme and extension of inflammation. Secondly, impairment cellular immunity due to peripheral lymphocyte apoptosis might be linked to the development of subsequent infectious complications in acute pancreatitis. Third, apoptosis in various major organs might be involved in the mechanism of multiple organs failure in acute pancreatitis. These findings might lead the new development in the therapeutic strategy of acute pancreatitis.
