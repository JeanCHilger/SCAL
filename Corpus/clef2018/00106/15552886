Recent advances in biochemical diagnosis and assessment of severity in acute pancreatitis. Serum amylase is most commonly used as a biochemical marker of acute pancreatitis (AP). But it lacks specificity. The serum lipase level is more accurate and a better marker. Serum elastase -1 level is specific and remains elevated longer, but its radioimmunoassay is not routinely used. Recently, it can be rapidly measured by latex turbidometric immunoassay with automatic analyzer. Biochemically, only CRP test is available and useful to assess severity, but its sensitivity is unacceptably low in the early course of the disease. Urinary trypsinogen activation peptide (TAP) or trypsinogen-2 is an earlier marker. Increasing knowledge of the inflammatory process in AP has led to possibly useful biochemical indicators of severity, such as cytokines, nonpancreatic synovial type group II PLA2 or granulocyte elastase.
