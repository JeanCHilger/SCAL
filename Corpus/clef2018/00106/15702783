Effects of analogs of pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide on acute pancreatitis in rats. To examine the effects of analogs of pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP)--PACAP6-27 (10, 100 microg/kg) and (4-Cl-D-Phe6, Leu17)VIP (10, 100 microg/kg) on the pancreata of normal rats and on the development of experimental acute pancreatitis.Male Wistar rats were allocated into normal control groups, experimental acute pancreatitis groups and PACAP analog intervention groups. Acute pancreatitis was induced with s.c. cerulein and intraductal sodium taurocholate PACAP analogs were infused intravenously immediately after pancreatitis induction. Pancreatic morphology was observed at 4 h, and serum amylase, pancreatic water content and PACAP contents were measured.It was found that PACAP6-27 induced pancreatic edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, and elevation of serum amylase [(1464.33 +/- 265.6)-(1692.17 +/- 312.18)] IU/L vs (520.8 +/- 163.27) IU/L of control, P < 0.05) that PACAP6-27 aggravated vacuolization of pancreatic acinar cells in cerulein-induced pancreatitis with hemorrhage and fatty and parenchymal necrosisPACAP6-27 and (4-Cl-D-Phe6, Leu17)VIP could induce mild pancreatitis and aggravate experimental acute pancreatitis. PACAP probably plays a role in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis.
