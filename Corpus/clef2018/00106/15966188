Hyperamylasemia induced by percutaneous papillary balloon dilatation for symptomatic choledocholithiasis. We investigated the relationship between percutaneous papillary balloon dilatation (PPBD) and hyperamylasemia after PPBD.We studied the rate of pancreatitis and asymptomatic hyperamylasemia after PPBD for choledocholithiasis in 64 symptomatic patients. Pancreatitis was defined as epigastric pain combined with at least a 3-fold rise in serum amylase at 24 hours after PPBD. Asymptomatic hyperamylasemia was defined as a rise in serum amylase (normal range, 50 to 160 IU/L) without epigastric pain.The stones were successfully pushed out into the duodenum in all patients. Three patients developed post-PPBD pancreatitis, graded moderate in one and mild in two. Serum amylase values were elevated over the normal upper limit in 21 patients, 33%, over 3-fold in 10, 16% over 1000 IU/L in 6, 9%. Asymptomatic hyperamylasemia was observed in 18 patients. The amylase value after PPBD was elevated to more than 160 IU/L in 44% (17/39) of patients 80 years old or under vs. 16% (4/25) of patients older than 80 and in 23% (10/44) of patients with intrahepatic bile duct dilatation on admission vs. 55% (11/20) of patients without it, with a significant difference, respectively (p<0.05). The amylase value after PPBD was elevated to more than 1000 IU/L in 15% (6/39) of patients 80 years old or under vs. 0% (0/25) of patients older than 80 and in 29% (4/14) of patients with bile duct stones having a horizontal diameter of 8mm or smaller and 4% (2/50) of patients with stones larger than 8mm (p < 0.05 and p<0.01, respectively).We believe that postoperative continuous decompression of the bile duct by PPBD is reliable and that it contributed to the prevention of severe pancreatitis. We conclude that PPBD can be performed more safely in symptomatic patients older than 80 with choledocholithiasis with intrahepatic bile duct dilatation at the time of admission.
