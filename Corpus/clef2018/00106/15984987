The clinical value of procalcitonin in early assessment of acute pancreatitis. Early assessment of the severity and the etiology is crucial in the management of acute pancreatitis. To determine the value of procalcitonin (PCT) as a prognostic marker and as an indicator of biliary etiology in the early phase of acute pancreatitis.In a prospective study, 75 consecutive patients were included (severe pancreatitis in 12 patients, biliary etiology in 42 cases). The value of PCT as a prognostic marker was compared to C-reactive protein (CRP), hematocrit (HCT), acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score, and Ranson score. The value of PCT as an indicator of biliary etiology was compared to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (AP). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was applied as a measure of the overall accuracy of the single markers and multiple scoring systems.The most accurate prediction of severe disease was provided by the APACHE II score on the day of admission (AUC: APACHE II, 0.78 CRP, 0.73PCT is of limited additional value for early assessment of severity and etiology in acute pancreatitis. CRP is found to be a reliable prognostic marker with a delay of 48 h, while ALT is validated as the best indicator of biliary etiology.
