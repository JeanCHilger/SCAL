Primary sclerosing cholangitis associated with limy bile and acute pancreatitis. Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) as the cause of acute pancreatitis (AP) is a rare phenomenon. Here, we report the first case of PSC associated with limy bile (LB) as well as AP. In this case, spontaneous outflow of the LB occurred, and the AP resolved on its own with conservative management. In addition to the administration of ursodeoxycholic acid, endoscopic intervention was undertaken and the patient remains symptom free to date. This report describes a unique case in which PSC, LB, and AP occurred in the same patient. The association of these rare conditions is also discussed.
