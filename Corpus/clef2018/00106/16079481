The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, lovastatin (statin) ameliorates CCK-induced acute pancreatitis in rats. Statin, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, has an anti-inflammatory effect. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Lovastatin (statin) on the cholecystokinin-octapeptide (CCK)-induced acute pancreatitis in rats. In statin treated group, the pancreas weight/body weight (pw/bw) ratio in CCK-induced acute pancreatitis was significantly lower than DMSO-treated group. Statin also increased the pancreatic level of HSP 60. Additionally, the secretions of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and IL-6 and the lipase levels were decreased in statin treated group. These results suggest that statin may play an important role in mitigating the progression of the inflammatory reactions during acute pancreatitis.
