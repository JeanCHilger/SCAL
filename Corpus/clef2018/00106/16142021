Combination of apolipoprotein E2 and lipoprotein lipase heterozygosity causes severe hypertriglyceridemia during pregnancy. Pregnancy is a physiological condition where plasma triglyceride levels are moderately increased. This results from raised synthesis of very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) in response to elevated estrogen levels. The occurrence of marked hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is rare and may result from combination of heterozygote mutation in the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene and apolipoprotein E2 isoform, as reported in this case. This observation illustrates the interaction between genetic and environmental factors, since pregnancy may disclose a silent LPL deficiency. The risk of acute pancreatitis threatens both the mother and fetus lives. Early recognition of severe HTG and appropriate management are essential for a successful pregnancy outcome.
