Effect of cecostomy on the pathophysiology and prognosis of acute experimental pancreatitis. In 76 male wistar rats with a median weight of 340 g acute pancreatitis was induced by injection of 2% sodium taurocholate into a temporarily closed duodenal loop. 40 animals received an additional cecostomy (group B), the others served as controls (group A). The postoperative figures for amylase, leucocyte count, and hemoglobin were nearly identical in both groups. According to histologic criteria acute pancreatitis was comparable in both groups, too. In nine rats endotoxin was found elevated postoperatively (13.4%). Seven animals belonged to the control (22.6%) and only two to the cecostomy group (5.6%). The difference was statistically significant (p less than 0.05). Also the differences between the median serum endotoxin levels reached statistic significance (79 ng/l in group B vs. 219 ng/l in group A). Mortality was significantly increased in endotoxin-positive animals (42.9% vs. 19.4%). Additionally, among the animals of the control group alterations of the colonic mucosa were observed more frequently than in the cecostomy group. The results are in favour of a translocation of endotoxin from the gut lumen into the circulation during acute experimental pancreatitis.
