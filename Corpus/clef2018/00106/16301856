A case of metastasis-induced acute pancreatitis improved by chemotherapy. Pancreatic metastases are found in up to 40% of patients with small cell lung cancer, but metastasis-induced acute pancreatitis is rare. Treatment of metastasis-induced acute pancreatitis is initially supportive, but failure of conservative management are common. There are few reports on aggressive treatment with chemotherapy which lead to rapid clinical improvement and prolongation of survival in patients with metastasis-induced acute pancreatitis. We experienced a case of metastasis-induced acute pancreatitis in a patient with small cell lung cancer. Despite conservative treatment with dietary restriction and intravenous fluid supply, serum amylase levels increased persistently with severe abdominal pain. After chemotherapy with irinotecan and carboplatin, abdominal pain and serum amylase levels resolved dramatically.
