Acute pancreatitis associated with hemophagocytic syndrome in systemic lupus erythematous: a case report. Exceptionally, acute pancreatitis and reactive hemophagocytic syndrome (RHS) are observed in the course of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, the association of the two conditions has never been reported before. A 31-years-old woman with a 7-year history of SLE was admitted for abdominal pain and fever. Elevated serum amylase and pancreatic enlargement on computerized tomography confirmed the diagnosis of pancreatitis. Laboratory examinations revealed pancytopenia, abnormal hepatic tests, and elevation of serum LDH and triglyceride levels. Bone marrow aspiration showed hemophagocytosis. The patient responded well to high dose corticosteroids. About eighty cases of pancreatitis have been reported in patients with SLE. The mechanisms are still unclear: SLE as the primary etiologic factor, drug toxicity, especially steroids which play a controversial role, or infection. About 40 cases of RHS have been reported in patients with SLE, sometimes associated with active infection. Overall mortality is 38.5%. When RHS occurs as an initial manifestation of SLE, or in the course of active SLE, it responds well to immunosuppressive therapy.
