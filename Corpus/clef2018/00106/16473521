Effects of gabexate mesilate on serum inflammatory cytokines in rats with acute necrotizing pancreatitis. Gabexate mesilate is a synthetic protease inhibitor. The effectiveness of gabexate mesilate in patients with acute pancreatitis is controversial. Proinflammatory cytokines are associated with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in acute pancreatitis. A compensatory anti-inflammatory response occurs in parallel with SIRS. We investigated the effects of gabexate mesilate on acute necrotizing pancreatitis in rats, emphasizing the changes in serum levels of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Acute necrotizing pancreatitis was induced by retrograde infusion of sodium taurodeoxycholate into the pancreatobiliary duct in rats. The rats were divided into three groups. Group I was given gabexate mesilate 2 mg/kg/h i.v. continuously 1 h before the induction of acute pancreatitis. Group II was given gabexate mesilate the same dose immediately after the induction of acute pancreatitis. Group III was given normal saline as the controls. Serum levels of amylase, lipase, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, and interleukin-10, pancreatic histopathology and hemodynamics were examined at 5h after the induction of acute pancreatitis. Gabexate mesilate significantly reduced serum levels of amylase, lipase, tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6 at 5 h. Serum levels of interleukin-10 significantly increased in Group I, as compared with Groups II and III. The severity of pancreatic histopathology, the reduction of mean arterial pressure, the volume of ascites and pancreatic wet weight/body weight ratios were also significantly improved by the administration of gabexate mesilate. The beneficial effects of gabexate mesilate on acute pancreatitis may be, in part, due to the modulation of inflammatory cytokine responses.
