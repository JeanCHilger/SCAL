The expression of toll-like receptor 2, 4 of livers in mice with systemic inflammatory response syndrome. The complicated pathogenesis of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is a hot topic in critical care medicine. In this study we explored the expression of toll-like receptor (TLR) 2, 4 of livers in SIRS mice and evaluated the role of TLR2, 4 in the pathogenesis of SIRS.Forty BABL/C mice were randomly divided into 2 groups: control (n=20) and SIRS (n=20). SIRS model was induced by severe acute pancreatitis. Blood routine, blood amylase, glutamic pyruvic transaminase and temperature were measured. Histological changes of pancreases and livers were observed microscopically. The mRNA expressions of TLR2, 4 were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The protein expressions of TLR2, 4 were examined by Western blot.Marked edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, hemorrhage, and necrosis were observed in the pancreases and livers of SIRS mice. The concentrations of amylase and glutamic pyruvic transaminase were increased significantly. Body temperature and white blood cell count were decreased. The mRNA and protein expressions of TLR2, 4 increased markedly in SIRS mice. Significant difference was observed between SIRS and control mice (P<0.01).The expressions of TLR2, 4 of livers were increased markedly in SIRS mice, indicating that TLR might play an important role in the pathogenesis of SIRS.
