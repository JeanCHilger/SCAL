Comparison of lipase activity in peritoneal fluid of dogs with different pathologies--a complementary diagnostic tool in acute pancreatitis? A clinical diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is often difficult to obtain. Histopathology remains the gold standard, whereas clinical signs, diagnostic imaging and laboratory testing, even in combination, may be insufficient. In a prospective study, lipase activity in ascitic fluid of various aetiologies was determined in 44 dogs in order to investigate its performance in cases of acute pancreatitis. Data of simultaneously determined blood lipase activities were available in 27 dogs. Lipase activity was measured by a colorimetric assay. A complete peritoneal fluid analysis was performed. Dogs were divided into four groups, according to their final diagnosis: acute pancreatitis (A), abdominal trauma (B), abdominal neoplasia (C) and others (hepatic or cardiac diseases) (D). Dogs with acute pancreatitis had a significantly higher peritoneal lipase activity than those in other groups (P < or = 0.024), while no significant difference was found between the other groups (P > or = 0.734). Blood lipase activity as well as protein content and total cell count of the ascitic fluid did not show any significant difference between groups. Data show that determination of lipase activity in dogs that develop ascites may be useful in complementing the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.
