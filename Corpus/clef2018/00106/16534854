Inhibitory effect of Patrinia scabiosaefolia on acute pancreatitis. To investigate the effect of Patrinia scabiosaefolia (PS) on the cholecystokinin (CCK) octapeptide-induced acute pancreatitis (AP) in rats.Wistar rats weighing 240-260 g were divided into three groups: (1) Normal saline-treated group (2) treatment with PS at 100 mg/kg group, in which PS was administered orally, followed by subcutaneous administration of 75 microg/kg CCK octapeptide three times after 1, 3 and 5 h, and this whole procedure was repeated for 5 dPS reduced the pancreatic weight/body weight ratio, the levels of serum amylase and lipase, and inhibited expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the CCK octapeptide-induced AP. Furthermore, PS pretreatment increased the pancreatic levels of HSP60 and HSP72.Pretreatment with PS has an anti-inflammatory effect on CCK octapeptide-induced AP.
