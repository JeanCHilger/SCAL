Neutrophil depletion--but not prevention of Kupffer cell activation--decreases the severity of cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis. To determine whether neutrophil depletion and Kupffer cell inhibition might combine their protective effects to decrease the severity of acute pancreatitis.Mice had cerulein administration to induce acute pancreatitis and were pretreated with either anti-mouse neutrophil serum or gadolinium chloride (GdCl3) to prevent Kupffer cell activation, or both treatments. Injury was assessed in pancreas and lungs. Myeloperoxidases (MPO) assessed neutrophil infiltration. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-10 were measured in serum, pancreas, lungs and liver.In mice with acute pancreatitis, neutrophil depletion reduced the severity of pancreatitis and pancreatitis-associated lung injury. Kupffer cell inactivation by GdCl3 had less protective effect, although IL-6 and IL-10 concentrations were significantly decreased. The protective treatment brought by neutrophil depletion was not enhanced by Kupffer cell inactivation and both treatments did not combine their protective effects.Our results confirm the role of activated neutrophils in aggravating organ injury in acute pancreatitis while the role of Kupffer cell activation is less obvious.
