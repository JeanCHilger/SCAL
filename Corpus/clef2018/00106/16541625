The correlation of procalcitonin serum levels with the presence of biliary obstruction. There is still no general agreement as to which patients suffering from attacks of acute biliary pancreatitis should undergo emergent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with subsequent endoscopic intervention (endoscopic papilotomy, stent placement etc.). Many authors have described large differences in Procalcitonin (PTC) serum levels in patients suffering from biliary pancreatitis as opposed to patients whose acute pancreatitis is based on toxic etiology. Therefore, we have investigated the correlation of Procalcitonin serum levels with the presence of biliary obstruction in patients undergoing ERCP examination.From 1.8.2004 to 31.3.2005, 97 patients undergoing ERCP were enrolled into the study. Blood samples were taken from each patient just before their ERCP examinations, and PCT serum levels were subsequently correlated to ERCP findings.ERCP examinations were completed in 90 out of 97 patients. Bile ducts obstructions were confirmed in 61 out of 90 patients and the mean serum level of PTC was 0.078 ng/ml. In the remaining 29 patients ERCP revealed normal findings and the mean PCT value was 0.069 ng/ml. There was no statistical correlation between PCT serum levels and the presence of biliary obstruction on ERCP findings.The measurement of PCT serum levels is of no help in the identification of patients, who should undergo emergent ERCP due to acute biliary pancreatitis (Tab. 1, Fig. 1, Ref. 6).
