Effects of lazaroid U-74389G on acute necrotizing pancreatitis in rats. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of U-74389G on acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP) induced by glycodeoxycholic acid in rats. The induction of ANP resulted in a significant increase in mortality rate, pancreatic necrosis, and serum levels of amylase, alanine aminotransferase, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and urea, in lactate dehydrogenase levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and in the activities of myeloperoxidase and malondialdehyde in pancreas and lung tissue a significant decrease was observed in serum calcium levels, blood pressure, urine output, and pO(2). The use of U-74389G inhibited the changes in serum urea, pO(2), and tissue levels of myeloperoxidase and malondialdehyde in pancreas and lungs. Moreover, it indicated a limited effect on the course of ANP in the rats and did not reduce mortality and pancreatic damage. Therefore, it may be used in the treatment of lung injury during acute pancreatitis.
