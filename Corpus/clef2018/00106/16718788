Effect of early administration of exogenous basic fibroblast growth factor on acute edematous pancreatitis in rats. To observe the therapeutic effect of early administration of exogenous Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) on acute edematous pancreatitis (AEP) in rats.Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three (n = 10): normal control group (group I), AEP group (group II) and AEP with bFGF treatment group (group III). AEP was induced by subcutaneous injection of cerulein (5.5 microg/kg and 7.5 microg/kg) at 1 h interval into rats of groups II and III. Three hours after induction of AEP, 100 microg/kg bFGF was administrated intraperitoneally for 1 h to group III rats. For test of DNA synthesis in acinar cells, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling solution was intraperitoneally injected into the rats of groups II and III 24 h after bFGF treatment. The changes in serum amylase, lipase, pancreatic tissue wet/dry ratio were detected.In bFGF treatment group, there was a significant decrease in the volume of serum amylase, lipase and the pancreatic wet/dry weight ratio(1383.0+/-94.6 U/L, 194.0+/-43.6 U/L, 4.32+/-0.32) compared to AEP group (3464+/-223.7 U/L, 456+/-68.7 U/L, 6.89+/-0.47) (P < 0.01), and no significant difference was found between bFGF treatment and control group (1289+/-94.0 U/L, 171+/-23.4 U/L, 4.12+/-0.26, P > 0.05). The inflammatory changes such as interstitial edema, polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and vacuolization were significantly ameliorated compared to AEP group (P < 0.01). A small number of BrdU-labeled nuclei were observed in acinar cells of AEP rats (1.8+/-0.3 nuclei/microscopic field, n = 10) while diffuse BrdU-labeled nuclei were found in bFGF-treated rats (18.9+/-1.4 nuclei/microscopic field, n = 10) (P < 0.01). Immunohistochemical study showed increased DNA synthesis in pancreatic acinar cells.Early administration of exogenous bFGF has significant therapeutic effect on cerulein-induced acute edematous pancreatitis in rats. Its mechanism is related to the amelioration of inflammation and facilitation of pancreatic regeneration.
