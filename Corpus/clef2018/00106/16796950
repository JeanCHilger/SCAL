Utility of magnetic resonance cholangiography prior to cholecystectomy in acute biliary pancreatitis. To analyze the role of magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRC) in candidates for cholecystectomy after acute biliary pancreatitis (ABP).We performed a prospective study of patients with mild ABP (Atlanta criteria) admitted to our hospital from January 2004 to March 2005. Diagnosis of ABP was based on clinical features, serum amylase levels more than 3 times higher than the upper level of normality, and gallstones detected by ultrasonography. In all patients, MRC was performed preoperatively. If positive for common bile duct stones (CBDS), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) was performed, followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). When MRC was negative, LC was performed directly. Intraoperative cholangiography was not routinely performed .Of the 31 patients admitted, 27 were included (mean age 66.4 +/- 18 years, 78% female). Four patients were excluded: 2 refused to undergo cholecystectomy and two had severe ABP. The mean interval between onset of ABP and cholecystectomy was 1.7 months +/- 1.2. Three patients (11.1%) experienced recurrence within 4 weeks of the index admission. MRC revealed CBDS in four patients (14.8%). In 3 patients, all the gallstones were removed by ERCP and ES. In one patient, 12 gallstones were retrieved but attempts to remove a stone from the cystic duct were unsuccessful. One patient with preoperative CBDS was readmitted 4 weeks after cholecystectomy due to recurrence. Another patient with negative findings on preoperative MRC was also readmitted with postcholecystectomy ABP. Twenty-five of the 27 patients (93%) have remained asymptomatic after cholecystectomy (median follow-up: 16 months [8-22 months]).MRC should not be routinely used in the preoperative evaluation of patients with ABP but is an accurate tool in selected patients with this disease.
