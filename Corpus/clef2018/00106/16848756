Does the septic shock interfere experimental acute pancreatitis in rats? Acute pancreatitis is a disease involving pro-inflammatory mediators. Two complex and multifactorial pathogenetic ways lead to edematous or necrotizing pancreatitis. The course of the disease is thought to be the consequence of an acute inflammatory response.The authors examined the impact of Escherichia coli LPS on the acute cerulein pancreatitis in rats.The study was performed on rats using the ceruleine pancreatitis model. The activation status of polymorphonuclear cells, blood IL-6 concentration, oxidative stress parameters, pancreatic enzymes concentration and microscopic alterations were determined at 5th and 9th h observations.In acute pancreatitis and acute pancreatitis with LPS groups, the peripheral polymorphonuclear cells activity was lower than in control one. Authors noticed the same neutrophil activation in acute pancreatitis after lipopolysaccharide administration although the peripheral blood polymorphonuclear cells count was significantly higher at the 9th h observation. LPS neither changed the oxidative stress within pancreatic gland, nor amylase or serum lipase activity. LPS given to acute pancreatitis animals resulted in significant increase of serum IL-6 concentration at 5th observation turning normal after 9th h.Collected data supports thesis of early polymorphonuclear cells involvement in acute pancreatitis and oxidative stress evidence in pancreatic parenchyma. However, results did not reveal that administration of LPS amplified inflammatory response during the course of acute pancreatitis.
