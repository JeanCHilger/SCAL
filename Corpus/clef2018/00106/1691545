Pancreatitis necessitating urinary undiversion in a bladder-drained pancreas transplant. After successful combined pancreaticoduodeno-renal transplant in an insulin-dependent diabetic, recurrent episodes of transplant pancreatitis were treated with Foley catheter drainage. The apparent cause of pancreatitis was increased pressure on the pancreatic duct due to infrequent voiding and a large bladder. A frequent voiding program partially relieved the pancreatitis, but final resolution necessitated conversion of the pancreaticoduodeno-cystostomy to a Roux-en-Y duodenojejunostomy at 6 months posttransplant. Both renal and pancreatic function are stable after 1 year, with no recurrence of pancreatitis since urinary undiversion. We believe pressure pancreatitis or urine reflux pancreatitis to be an infrequently reported cause of graft dysfunction in bladder-drained pancreas transplant recipients.
