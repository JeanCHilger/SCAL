Cholecystokinin antagonist prevents hyperamylasemia and improves pancreatic exocrine function in cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis. Supramaximal cerulein administration induces acute pancreatitis, which markedly impairs pancreatic secretion in conscious rats. We hypothesized that pretreatment with the potent cholecystokinin antagonist, L-364,718, improves the pancreatic secretory impairment associated with cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis. Rats were surgically prepared with gastric, duodenal, bile, and pancreatic fistulas and jugular vein catheters. On postoperative day 4, groups of rats were administered (a) L-364,718 1 mg/kg intraduodenally, (b) cerulein 5 micrograms/kg/h for 6 h intravenously, (c) L-364,718 1 mg/kg intraduodenally followed by cerulein 5 micrograms/kg/h for 6 h intravenously, and (d) safflower oil carrier intraduodenally. On postoperative day 5, we studied cholecystokinin (CCK)-stimulated pancreatic secretion. Plasma amylase was measured at the time of surgery and at the conclusion of experiments on postoperative days 4 and 5. The duodenally administered CCK antagonist had no effect, 24 h later, on CCK-evoked protein secretion and prevented the pancreatic exocrine impairment and hyperamylasemia caused by supramaximal cerulein administration. These observations suggest that cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis is mediated by a CCK-receptor mechanism.
