Common channel syndrome--2 case reports. The common channel syndrome is a disease mostly of young girls. To demonstrate the problems of diagnosis and therapy we report on 2 cases operated on in 1987 and 1989. The long delay of several years between the onset of symptoms and the diagnosis might be shortened by improved diagnostic possibilities (Ultrasound, ERCP). In any case of hyperamylasemia or chronic pancreatitis in childhood an obstruction of the biliary tract should be excluded. The common channel syndrome can be treated by means of sphincteroplasty or a bilidigestive anastomosis.
