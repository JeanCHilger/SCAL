Clinical analysis of 9 cases of solid-cystic pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas with literature review. Solid-cystic pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas (SCPT) is a rare type of pancreatic tumor with low grade of malignancy. Its diagnosis and treatment remain controversial. This study was to discuss the diagnosis criteria and treatment strategy of SCPT.Clinical data, including general history, medical history, treatment history and treatment outcome, of 9 SCPT patients, treated in the Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery of the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University from Jan. 1997 to Feb. 2005, were analyzed retrospectively, and the related literature was reviewed to summarize the clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and treatment of SCPT.Among the 9 patients, 7 (77.8%) were women under 44 years old. The laboratory tests of liver function, serum amylase, and CEA, CA199 were normal. The accurate diagnosis rate of ultrasound was 22.2%, while that of CT was 77.8%. Most patients received local resection of the tumor. All patients were followed-up till Oct. 2005 and no metastasis was detected.SCPT is a rare disease with good prognosis. It occurs mainly in young women. In spite of unspecific laboratory tests, CT and fine needle aspiration method are useful to diagnose the disease. Based on literatures, operation could achieve satisfactory efficacy for SCPT patients.
