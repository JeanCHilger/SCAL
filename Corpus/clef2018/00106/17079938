Can pancreatic steatosis explain the finding of pancreatic hyperenzymemia in subjects with dyslipidemia? It has been proposed by some investigators that benign pancreatic hyperenzymemia could result from pancreatic steatosis that they believe would have been caused by dyslipidemia their diagnosis of steatosis was based on the finding of a hyperechogenic pancreas at ultrasound. The aim of this study was to assess the validity of this proposed model.The study group was composed of 18 subjects with benign pancreatic hyperenzymemia, 12 men and 6 women mean age, 55 yearsMagnetic resonance imaging showed normal pancreas with no signs of fatty infiltration in all 18 subjects with dyslipidemia, including those with both dyslipidemia and hyperechogenic pancreas at ultrasound. A similar result was found in all control subjects.The finding of a completely normal pancreas at magnetic resonance imaging does not support the proposed model in which pancreatic hyperenzymemia in subjects with dyslipidemia is attributed to pancreatic steatosis.
