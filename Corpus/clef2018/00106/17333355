Role of ghrelin and leptin in predicting the severity of acute pancreatitis. Ghrelin and leptin are the hormones that influence endocrine and exocrine functions of the pancreas and regulate feeding behaviors and energy metabolism. The aim of this study was to investigate the levels of ghrelin and leptin in pancreatitis of different severities and the relation of these hormones with blood glucose level and proinflammatory cytokines. The study was performed on 90 Wistar Albino rats. Three experimental groups composed of 30 rats were established: control group, 0.9% NaCl solution was injected intraperitoneally (i.p) acute edematous pancreatitis (AEP) group, 1 microg/100 g cerulein was injected i.p. five times, at 1-hr intervals
