Effect of BN52021 on NFkappa-Bp65 expression in pancreatic tissues of rats with severe acute pancreatitis. To investigate dynamic changes and significance of expression of NF-kappaBp65 in pancreatic tissues of rats with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), as well as BN52021 effects.Wistar male rats were randomly divided into negative control group (NC group, n=60), SAP-model group (SAP group, n=60), and BN52021-treated group (BN group, n=60), and each of the above groups was respectively divided into 6 subgroups at different time points after operation (1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h) (n=10). By RT-PCR and Western blot, NF-kappaBp65 mRNA and its protein expression in pancreatic tissues of rats were detected respectively.The expression of NF-kappaBp65 mRNA dynamically changed in both SAP groups and BN groups. The mRNA level was higher in SAP groups than NC groups at 2 h, 3 h, 12 h, and 24 h after operation (P<0.05), higher in BN groups than NC groups at all time points (P<0.05), and higher in BN groups than SAP group at 1 h (P<0.05). The NF-kappaBp65 protein level was higher in SAP groups than NC groups at 1 h, 3 h, and 6 h (P<0.01), and 2 h, 12 h, and 24 h (P<0.05), higher in BN groups than NC groups at all time points (P<0.05), and lower in BN groups than SAP groups at 1 h, 3 h, and 6 h (P<0.05).The expression of NF-kappaBp65 in pancreatic tissues is dynamically changed and the changes play an important role in pathogenesis of SAP. BN52021 exerts therapeutic effects through reducing the expression level of NF-kappaBp65 protein in the early stage of SAP.
