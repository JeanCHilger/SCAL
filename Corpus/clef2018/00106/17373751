Effect of parenteral and early intrajejunal nutrition on pancreatic digestive enzyme synthesis, storage and discharge in dog models of acute pancreatitis. To study the effect of early intrajejunal nutrition on enzyme-protein synthesis and secretion during acute pancreatitis.Fifteen dogs were randomly divided into parenteral nutrition (n = 7) and early intrajejunal nutrition groups (n = 8). An acute pancreatitis model was induced by injecting 5% sodium taurocholate and trypsin into the pancreas via the pancreatic duct. Intrajejunal nutrition was delivered with a catheter via a jejunostomy tube after the model was established for 24 h. On d 1 and 7 and at the beginning of nutritional support, radioactive tracing and electron microscopes were used to evaluate the enzyme-protein synthesis in acinar cells, the subcellular fractionation and the change in zymogen granules after 1.85 x 10(6) Bq L-(3)H phenylalanine was infused at 30, 60, 120, and 180 min.The 3H radioactivity in pancreatic acinar cells reached its peak level at 60 min, and the contents in the early intrajejunal nutrition group were higher than those in the parenteral nutrition group, which were then decreased. The mean number and area of zymogen granules did not show any significant statistical difference in both groups on d 1 or on d 7 (P > 0.05).Early intrajejunal nutrition might be effective in dogs with acute pancreatitis.
