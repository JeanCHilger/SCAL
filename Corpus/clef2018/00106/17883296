Effect of the administration of rectal indomethacin on amylase serum levels after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and its impact on the development of secondary pancreatitis episodes. Hyperamylasemia and acute pancreatitis represent the most frequent major complication after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), developing in 1-30% of cases.To determine the incidence of hyperamylasemia and acute pancreatitis after ERCP, and to assess the utility of rectal indomethacin to prevent these events.A randomized clinical trial. During a 12-month period 150 patients were included. They were divided up into a study group (n = 75), where 100 mg of rectal indomethacin were administered 2 hours prior to the procedure, and a control group (n = 75), which received rectal glycerin. Two hours after ERCP serum amylase levels were measured and classified as follows: 0<or=150 IU/L, 1 = 151-599 IU/L, 2>or=600 IU/L. Clinical pancreatitis episodes were quantified and classified according to Ranson's criteria.Gender distribution: 100 women and 50 men. Mean age: 55.37 +/- 18.0 for the study group, and 51.1 +/- 17.0 for the control group. A diagnosis of benign pathology was present in 56 (74.7%) cases in the study group, and 59 (78.7%) controls. After ERCP 13 (17.3%) patients in the study group and 28 (37.3%) in the control group developed hyperamylasemia (p (2) 0.05). Hyperamylasemia > 600 IU/L was found in 3 patients in the study group, and in 10 in the control group (p = 0.001). Mild pancreatitis was detected in 4 (5.3%) patients in the study group, and in 12 (16%) patients in the control group (p = 0.034). There were no deaths or adverse drug reactions.Rectal indomethacin before ERCP decreases the risk of hyperamylasemia and pancreatitis. Indomethacine is a feasible, low-cost drug with minimal or nil side effects.
