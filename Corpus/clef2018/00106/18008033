Activated protein C, an anticoagulant polypeptide, ameliorates severe acute pancreatitis via regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinases. Our aim was to investigate the changes of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) by activated protein C (APC) treatment in rats with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), and relate them to changes in SAP severity, thus providing evidence for developing clinical therapies.Sprague-Dawley rats were given an intravenous injection of saline (SAP group), APC (50 microg/kg or 10 microg/kg), or CNI1493 just before SAP induction. One group of rats underwent a sham operation (control group). Experimental samples were harvested 16 h after SAP induction. The gene expression of pancreatic MAPKs was evaluated by cDNA microarrays. The mRNA and protein/phosphorylated protein levels of p38 MAPK, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) 1/2, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and the protein levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1beta were determined in pancreatic tissue. The severity of disease was evaluated by pancreatic histology, the pancreatic wet/dry weight ratio, and the serum amylase level.In rats treated with APC (50 microg/kg) or CNI1493, the severity of pancreatitis and expression of pancreatic TNF-alpha and IL-1beta proteins were attenuated by the decreased expression and activity of p38 MAPK and JNK (vs. the SAP group, P < 0.01). The expression and activity of ERK1/2 were increased in APC-treated rats, especially in the group treated with APC 50 microg/kg (vs. the SAP or CNI1493-treated group, P < 0.01, respectively).Inhibition of expression of pancreatic p38 MAPK and JNK and upregulation of ERK1/2 expression by APC treatment may protect against pancreatic injury, thus ameliorating severity of the disease.
