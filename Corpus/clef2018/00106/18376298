Taurocholate-induced pancreatitis: a model of severe necrotizing pancreatitis in mice. The outcome from acute pancreatitis depends on the severity of systemic complications. To be able to investigate mechanisms underlying the development of these systemic complications in acute pancreatitis in both wild-type and genetically engineered animal models, a mouse model of severe necrotizing pancreatitis was developed and characterized.Pancreatitis was induced by retrograde infusion of sodium taurocholate into the common bile duct in mice. After determining the optimum volume and concentration of taurocholate, the pancreatic damage and systemic inflammatory response were compared with those in cerulein-induced pancreatitis.Pancreatic damage was higher in taurocholate pancreatitis than hyperstimulation-induced pancreatitis (24 hours: cerulein, 5.8 +/- 0.2 points taurocholate, 14.8 +/- 0.8 pointsTaurocholate pancreatitis is a reliable model for severe necrotizing pancreatitis in mice with significantly greater pancreatic damage and systemic inflammatory response in comparison with cerulein-induced pancreatitis.
