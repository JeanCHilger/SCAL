Risk factor analysis of severe acute pancreatitis complicated by pancreatic encephalopathy. To study the risk factors for severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) complicated by pancreatic encephalopathy (PE).Clinical data from 255 patients with SAP from January 2005 to December 2006 were reviewed. Thirty-one SAP patients had PE, and 224 SAP patients did not. Clinical characteristics of SAP patients in both PE group and non-PE group were analyzed.Ranson scale and the incidence rates of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, hypoproteinemia, hypocalcemia and hyperglycosemia in PE group were higher than those in non-PE group (P<0.05). There were no significant differences in acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II and CT severity index scales, the activities of amylase and lipase, the incidence rate of liver function failure, the infection rate and the operability between the PE group and the non-PE group (P>0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that ARDS and hyperglycosemia were high risk factors. Cure rate in PE group was higher than that in non-PE group.Nosogenesis of PE is the result of multiple factors. ARDS and hyperglycosemia may be the high risk factors for PE.
