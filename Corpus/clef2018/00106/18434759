Predictors of vascular and gastrointestinal complications in severe acute pancreatitis. To determine prognostic factors for arterial injury and gastrointestinal perforation in patients with severe acute pancreatitis (AP).A prospective cohort study was performed in 39 patients with AP whose Ranson scores were > or =3. The following parameters were assessed: Ranson score, APACHE II score, C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration on admission and on day 7, and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans on admission (first CT) and between days 6 and 8 (second CT). The Balthazar CT severity index was calculated.Six patients developed seven vascular and/or gastrointestinal complications (duodenal perforations in 3 and arterial pseudoaneurysm in 4). CRP on day 7 and the CT severity indices at the second CT were significantly higher in the complication group than in the noncomplication group. A stepwise logistic regression analysis demonstrated that CRP > or =15 mg/dl on day 7 and CT severity index > or =7 at the second CT were independent risk factors (p = 0.02 and 0.04, respectively). The odds ratio for CRP > or =15 mg/dl was 23.0 and 15.7 for a CT severity index of > or =7.A persistent elevation of the CRP concentration and a high CT severity index are independent risk factors for local complications associated with AP.
