Use of an endotoxin adsorber in the treatment of severe abdominal sepsis. Methods for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (endotoxin) reduction have been proposed as one way to improve the treatment of Gram-negative sepsis. Here we present a case with severe Gram-negative sepsis, treated with a novel device for LPS adsorption (Alteco LPS Adsorber, Alteco Medical AB, Lund, Sweden). After LPS adsorption, the level of LPS in the patient's bloodstream was almost eliminated: from 1.44 EU/ml before treatment to 0.03 EU/ml post treatment). The procalcitonin level and inflammatory cytokines were concurrently reduced. Also, an obvious improvement in the status of the patient's hemodynamics was seen. Forty-five days after treatment the patient is still alive. In conclusion, LPS adsorption may represent a significant improvement in the treatment of Gram-negative sepsis and further studies are planned.
