Proteasome inhibitor ameliorates severe acute pancreatitis and associated lung injury of rats. To observe the effect of proteasome inhibitor MG-132 on severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) and associated lung injury of rats.Male adult SD rats were randomly divided into SAP group, sham-operation group, and MG-132 treatment group. A model of SAP was established by injection of 5% sodium taurocholate into the biliary-pancreatic duct of rats. The MG-132 group was pretreated with 10 mg/kg MG-132 intraperitoneally (ip) 30 min before the induction of pancreatitis. The changes in serum amylase, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity of pancreatic and pulmonary tissue were measured. The TNF-alpha level in pancreatic cytosolic fractions was assayed with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. Meanwhile, the pathological changes in both pancreatic and pulmonary tissues were also observed.MG-132 significantly decreased serum amylase, pancreatic weight/body ratio, pancreatic TNF-alpha level, pancreatic and pulmonary MPO activity (P < 0.05). Histopathological examinations revealed that pancreatic and pulmonary samples from rats pretreated with MG-132 demonstrated milder edema, cellular damage, and inflammatory activity (P < 0.05).The proteasome inhibitor MG-132 shows a protective effect on severe acute pancreatitis and associated lung injury of rats.
