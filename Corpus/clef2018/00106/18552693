Increased levels of soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 in patients with acute pancreatitis. To determine the contribution of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM)-1 in acute pancreatitis (AP).Prospective study.General intensive care unit at Kobe University Hospital.Forty-eight patients with AP and seven patients as control.None.We measured serum concentrations of soluble TREM-1 (sTREM-1) at the time of admission by enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay. Serum sTREM-1 levels increased significantly in AP (63 +/- 11 pg/mL) and correlated with Ranson score (R = .628, p < .001) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (R = .504, p < .001). Serum TREM-1 levels were higher in patients with early organ dysfunction (which occurred within 7 days after onset) than those without early organ dysfunction (101 +/- 19 vs. 25 +/- 4 pg/mL, p < .001). Incidences of early organ dysfunction in patients whose serum sTREM-1 levels were < or = 40 and > 40 pg/mL were 17% and 83%, respectively (p < .001). The usefulness of serum sTREM-1 in detecting early organ dysfunction was superior to that of C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, Ranson score, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score. Serum sTREM-1 levels decreased with resolution of early organ dysfunction.Serum sTREM-1 levels were significantly increased and correlated with disease severity and early organ dysfunction in patients with AP. Serum sTREM-1 level may be a useful marker for early organ dysfunction in AP.
