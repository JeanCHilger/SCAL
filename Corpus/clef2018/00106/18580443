Pentoxifylline attenuates pulmonary inflammation and neutrophil activation in experimental acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis (AP) is associated with a systemic inflammatory response. Pentoxifylline (PTX) has been shown to attenuate neutrophil activation and end-organ injury in shock states such as hemorrhage and sepsis. We hypothesized that PTX would down-regulate AP-induced lung injury.Sprague-Dawley rats underwent catheterization of the pancreatic duct. Acute pancreatitis (n = 7) and AP/PTX animals (n = 7) received a retrograde infusion of 3.5% sodium taurocholate and intravenous treatment with normal saline or normal saline and PTX (25 mg/kg), respectively. Pulmonary neutrophil degranulation and sequestration were determined by zymography and detection of myeloperoxidase. Nuclear factor kappa B and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation was determined by Western blot. Cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant was quantified by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.Pulmonary histologic injury scores were attenuated in the AP/PTX group (P < 0.05). Plasma amylase levels remained unchanged. Pentoxifylline produced a significant decline in myeloperoxidase content and matrix metalloproteinase activity (P < 0.05). The increase in the phosphorylation of pulmonary nuclear factor kappa B, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and extracellular-related signal kinase 1/2 observed after AP was not demonstrated with PTX (P < 0.05). Pentoxifylline supplementation reduced pulmonary cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant levels by 50% (P < 0.05).Pentoxifylline significantly attenuated histologic lung injury, pulmonary neutrophil activity, and proinflammatory signaling in a severe model of AP. Therefore, PTX may serve as an adjunct for the treatment of the inflammatory complications of severe AP.
