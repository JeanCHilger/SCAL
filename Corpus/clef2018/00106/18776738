Autophagy and acute pancreatitis: a novel autophagy theory for trypsinogen activation. Autodigestion of the pancreas by its own prematurely activated digestive proteases is thought to be an important event in the onset of acute pancreatitis. Although lysosomal hydrolases, such as cathepsin B, play a key role in intrapancreatic trypsinogen activation, it remains unclear where and how trypsinogen meets these lysosomal enzymes. Autophagy is an intracellular bulk degradation system in which cytoplasmic components are directed to the lysosome/vacuole by a membrane-mediated process. To analyze the role of autophagy in acute pancreatitis, we produced a conditional knockout mouse that lacks the autophagy-related (Atg) gene Atg5 in the pancreatic acinar cells. The severity of acute pancreatitis induced by cerulein is greatly reduced in these mice. In addition, Atg5-deficient acinar cells show a significantly decreased level of trypsinogen activation. These data suggest that autophagy exerts a detrimental effect in pancreatic acinar cells by activation of trypsinogen to trypsin. We propose a theory in which autophagy accelerates trypsinogen activation by lysosomal hydrolases under acidic conditions, thus triggering acute pancreatitis in its early stage.
