West Nile virus-induced pancreatitis. West Nile Virus (WNV) infection is a fairly common infection in Israel, especially during the summer season. Common manifestations are fever, headaches, malaise and myalgia. Pancreatitis had been described only twice previously as a complication of WNV infection in the medical literature. In this report, an 88-year-old patient is described, who was admitted to hospital with fever, confusion and general deterioration in her condition, accompanied by severe abdominal pain. WNV infection was diagnosed by a lumbar puncture and serological tests. The laboratory results demonstrated elevated amylase and lipase levels. The patient was treated conservatively and the symptoms regressed slowly until full recovery. WNV infection and its complications are described, along with descriptions of previous reports of pancreatitis associated with WNV infection.
