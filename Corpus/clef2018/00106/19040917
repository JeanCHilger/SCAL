Choledochoduodenal fistula caused by blunt abdominal trauma in a child. We report a 15-year boy who presented with obstructive cholangiopathy and pancreatitis after blunt abdominal trauma. A magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showed dilated common bile duct, dilated hepatic ducts, and a suspicious choledochoduodenal fistula. An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography revealed a parapapillary choledochoduodenal fistula. An operation of choledochojejunostomy, excision of common bile duct, and cholecystectomy was done for recurrent cholangitis. Abdominal symptoms completely subsided one month later. Serum amylase, lipase and bilirubin levels turned to normal 3 months after operation.
