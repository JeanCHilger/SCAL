Prophylactic effect of glyceryl trinitrate on post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis: a randomized placebo-controlled trial. To examine the prophylactic effect of glyceryl trinitrate on post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis and hyperamylasemia.Patients scheduled for ERCP were randomly divided into study group and placebo group. Patients in study group and placebo group were treated with 5 mg glyceryl trinitrate and 100 mg vitamin C, respectively, 5 min before endoscopic maneuvers.A total of 74 patients were enrolled in the final analysis. Post-ERCP pancreatitis occurred in 3 patients (7.9%) of the study group and 9 patients (25%) in the placebo group (P = 0.012). Hyperamylasemia occurred in 8 patients of the study group (21.1%) and 13 patients (36.1%) of the placebo group (P = 0.037).Glyceryl trinitrate before ERCP can effectively prevent post-ERCP and hyperamylasemia.
