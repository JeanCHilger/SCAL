State of the pancreas in persons with alcohol-related risk factors. Clinico-laboratory and instrumental techniques were used to investigate the pancreas states in alcohol abusers at preclinical stage. Examined were 74 persons, 24-31 years of age, with established alcohol-related risk-factors, who would consider themselves healthy. The character and forms of alcohol addiction were determined by a psychiatrist. Complaints were studied in the group which fell into astheno-vegetative syndrome (56.2%), dyspeptic disorders (32%) and pain (14.1%). Ultrasound scanning of all the cases was performed. Pancreas tissue echostructure changes were detected in 16% cases, including fibrosis and edema in 7 and 5 cases, respectively. Hydrochloride methionine intraduodenal testing was performed to assess the pancreas external secretion indices. 98.6% cases manifested changes in external secretory function, e.i. increased concentration and secretion of amylase, decreased concentration and secretion of bicarbonates in the stable volume and rate of pancreatic juice secretion.
