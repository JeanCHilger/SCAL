Effect of 5-FU on modulation of disarrangement of immune-associated cytokines in experimental acute pancreatitis. To investigate the effects of 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) on modulation of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in acute pancreatitis and the mechanism of it in the treatment of acute pancreatitis.Male Sprague Dawley rats were assigned to 3 Groups: Group A, sham operated rats as controls (n = 7) Group B, acute pancreatitis induced by ductal injection with 5% sodium cholate at a volume of 1.0 mL/kg without any other treatmentFour rats in Group B and one in Group C died after pancreatitis was induced. Both pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-6) at the 2 and 6 h period and the anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, TGF-beta) at 24 h increased significantly (P < 0.05) in rats of Group B. After treatment with 5-FU, TNF-alpha, IL-1, and IL-6 in serum of rats of Group C were inhibited at 2 and 6 h after operation (P < 0.05), and IL-10, TGF-beta were inhibited at 24 h compared to Group B (P < 0.05). Obvious improvements in the severity of the acute pancreatitis, including the amylase levels, wet weight of pancreatic tissue and neutrophil counts, were also observed after treatment with 5-FU.5-FU is an anti-metabolic and immunosuppressive agent which can minimize the abnormal immune cytokine response and relieve the pathophysiological disorders associated with experimental acute pancreatitis.
