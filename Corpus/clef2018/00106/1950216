Pancreatogenic pleuritis and pancreatico-pleural fistula: pathogenesis, diagnosis and therapy. Two patients with alcohol-induced chronic pancreatitis are presented, who developed a massive pleural effusion characterized by an extremely high amylase content. We report our diagnostic observations and therapeutic experiences in non-operative and surgical management. A review on the pertinent literature is given. Acute pancreatitis frequently (10-20%) occurs in conjunction with small left-sided pleural effusions. These effusions usually undergo spontaneous regression. Their genesis is explained by vascular transdiaphragmatic inflammatory involvement of the pleural space. In patients with alcohol-induced chronic pancreatitis pleural effusion is, however, a rare event. The activity of the pancreas-specific enzymes (amylase, lipase) are extremely high. The most likely underlying pathogenetic mechanism is transdiaphragmatic lymphatic transfer of pancreatic secretions to the subpleural space. A rare cause is the formation of a pancreatico-pleural fistula. The use of endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) can reveal the site of pancreatic fistulas to the pleural cavity.
