Ghrelin inhibits the development of acute pancreatitis and nuclear factor kappaB activation in pancreas and liver. To investigate the influence of ghrelin on the development of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) and the expression of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65 in the pancreas and liver.Severe acute pancreatitis was induced in rat by sodium taurocholate injection in the pancreaticobiliary duct. Ghrelin was administrated twice at the dose 10 or 20 nmol/kg per injection, respectively. Then, serum amylase activity serum tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1beta, and interleukin 6 concentrationsThe serumal parameters increased, and morphological damages were observed in the pancreas and liver in SAP rats. Nuclear factor kappaB p65 expression was significantly higher in the pancreas and liver than sham-operated rats (P < 0.05). Treatment with ghrelin attenuated the morphological damages, and reduced the serumal parameters. Nuclear factor kappaB p65 expression was also significantly reduced by ghrelin (P < 0.05), both in the pancreas and liver.Ghrelin inhibits the development of acute pancreatitis induced by sodium taurocholate. It exerts the therapeutic effects through inhibiting NF-kappaB expression, thereby blocks the inflammatory signal transduction pathway and reduces the release of inflammatory media and cytokines.
