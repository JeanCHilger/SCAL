Dynamic change in microcirculation of pancreas after experimental high-voltage electric burn. To observe the changes in surface microcirculation of pancreas after high-voltage electric burn (HEB).Thirty rabbits were divided into electrical injury (E) group and control (C) group in a simple random method, with 15 rabbits in each group. Rabbit model of HEB was reproduced from E group with TC-30-20KVA type voltage regulator and YDJ-10KVA type experimental transformer. Rabbits in C group were shamly burned with the same equipment as in E group but not electrified. Intravenous blood of rabbits in both groups was drawn 15 mins before HEB and 0, 1, 2, 4, 8 h after to determine the levels of serum amylase and blood glucose. The morphology of the pancreas microvessels and its surrounding tissues, and the dynamic changes in microvascular blood flow were observed with WX-9 microscope and its image analytical system.The level of serum amylase of rabbits in E group increased gradually and peaked (849 +/- 39) U/L at 8 post HEB h (PHH), which decreased gradually reaching the nadir (153 +/- 21) U/L at 8 PHH in C group (P < 0.05). The blood glucose levels of rabbits in E group and C group increased gradually, with the former level obviously higher than the latter (P < 0.05). Arteriole, venule and capillary network on the surface of pancreatic lobules of rabbits in both groups were clearly seen and well-distributed in the natural way before HEB. In E group, arterioles of rabbits contracted at 0 PHH, and increased gradually in caliber size at 1 PHH venules of rabbits were unevenly thickened at 2 PHH, and dilated at 8 PHHHEB produces microcirculation disturbance and functional disturbance of pancreas.
