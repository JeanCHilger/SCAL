Pathological and immunohistochemical examinations of the pancreas in subacute endosulfan toxicity in rabbits. Pancreas pathology in subacute endosulfan toxicity and the effect of vitamin C in rabbits were studied.: Twenty-four rabbits in 4 groups were used. The rabbits in group END were given a daily sublethal dose (1 mg/kg of body weight) of endosulfan in corn oil by oral gavage for 6 weeks. Group END+C received the same dose of endosulfan and also vitamin C (20 mg/kg) every other day. Group OIL+C received oral corn oil daily and vitamin C (20 mg/kg) every other day. Group OIL received corn oil daily by oral gavage throughout the experiment. Serum amylase, lipase, and glucose levels were analyzed 1 week after the last treatment. Histopathological and immunohistochemical methods were used.The amylase levels were normal, but the lipase levels were increased in all the groups. Marked increases in glucose levels were observed in the END and the OIL+C groups. Microscopy examination of the pancreases indicated degenerative changes in the END group. The pancreases of the END+C group were relatively normal in appearance. The immunohistochemistry of the pancreas showed marked decreases in proinsulin-, insulin-, and amylin-secreting cells and slight decreases in glucagon-secreting cells, whereas cells expressing caspase 3 increased.Endosulfan can cause toxic effects on rabbit pancreases, but vitamin C has an ameliorative effect.
