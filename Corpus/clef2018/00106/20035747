Protective effects of the free radical scavenger edaravone on acute pancreatitis-associated lung injury. Impaired lung function is the primary contributor to most deaths associated with severe acute pancreatitis. It is widely accepted that oxidative stress plays a central role in the pathogenesis of pancreatitis and associated complications. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated whether therapeutic treatment with the free radical scavenger edaravone could protect rats against acute pancreatitis and the associated lung injury. Acute pancreatitis was induced by infusion of 1ml/kg of sodium taurocholate (3% solution) into the biliopancreatic duct. Edaravone (8mg/kg) was administered 1h and 13h after inducing pancreatitis, the severity of pancreatic and pulmonary injuries was evaluated 24h after inducing pancreatitis. Edaravone treatment significantly reduced the elevated malondialdehyde levels in rat lungs after acute pancreatitis, suggesting an important role for free radicals in acute pancreatitis-associated lung injury. In addition, edaravone showed significant protective effects against neutrophil infiltration and tissue injury in both pancreas and lung, as demonstrated by serum amylase levels, myeloperoxidase activity and histopathological analysis. Edaravone treatment also attenuated the elevated mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in rat lungs after acute pancreatitis. In conclusion, edaravone protects rats against acute pancreatitis-associated lung injury, probably through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Thus, edaravone shows promise as a treatment for lung injury in patients with acute pancreatitis.
