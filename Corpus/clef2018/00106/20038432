Betacellulin protects from pancreatitis by activating stress-activated protein kinase. Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a serious, unpredictable clinical problem, the pathophysiology of which is poorly understood. Here, we evaluate whether betacellulin (BTC), a ligand of the epidermal growth factor receptor also able to activate the proapoptotic ERBB4 receptor, can protect against experimental AP.AP was induced in transgenic mice overexpressing BTC (BTC-tg), control mice, or control mice after administration of recombinant BTC. The severity of pancreatitis was assessed by measurements of serum amylase and lipase and histologic grading. The involvement of the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) was evaluated by treating BTC-tg mice with an SAPK inhibitor before induction of AP.BTC-tg mice showed increased apoptosis and proliferation in the exocrine pancreas, indicating an increased cell turnover. There was a marked, epidermal growth factor receptor-independent decrease in pancreas weight. After induction of AP by cerulein injection, BTC-tg mice showed a significantly lower increase in serum amylase and lipase levels as well as less pronounced tissue necrosis, edema, and inflammation, as compared to nontransgenic littermates. This protective effect, also confirmed in the L-arginine AP model, was associated with increased phosphorylation of SAPK and abrogated after treatment of BTC-tg mice with a SAPK inhibitor. Finally, the protective effect of BTC against AP was confirmed by treating nontransgenic mice with recombinant BTC.These findings indicate a potential application of the BTC/ERBB4 pathway for modulating the course of AP.
