Anti-inflammatory effects of peritoneal lavage in acute pancreatitis. Intraperitoneal administration of trypsin stimulates the production of cytokines from peritoneal macrophages. Removing the pancreatitis-associated ascitic fluid from the peritoneal cavity may decrease the systemic inflammatory response in acute pancreatitis (AP). We investigated the effect of peritoneal lavage on the systemic inflammatory response in severe AP.Acute pancreatitis was induced in Wistar rats by 5% taurocholate intraductal injection. Peritoneal lavage was performed for 4 hours after onset of AP. At 4 hours after induction of AP, serum samples were assayed for amylase and inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin-6 [IL-6], and IL-10). Expression of pancreatic cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase, liver mitochondrial function, and pulmonary myeloperoxidase activities were determined.Peritoneal lavage after AP led to a decrease in serum levels of tumor necrosis factor α and IL-6 and an increase in IL-10. In the pancreas, this treatment reduced cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression. Liver mitochondrial dysfunction was also reduced. There were no differences on serum amylase levels and pulmonary myeloperoxidase between groups with AP.Peritoneal lavage has a systemic anti-inflammatory effect in severe AP and may be able to decrease the severity of severe AP.
