Acute pancreatitis due to rotavirus gastroenteritis in a child. Serum amylase can be elevated in various pathological conditions, but its primary application is as a biochemical test for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. Acute gastroenteritis has not been widely recognized as a cause for hyperamylasemia and pancreatitis.We describe a case of acute pancreatitis after rotavirus gastroenteritis occurring in a previously healthy child.Rotavirus infection was demonstrated by detection of virus particles in stool culture and pancreatitis by raised serum amylase and lipase levels. No abnormalities were noticed during clinical follow-up.Further investigation to understand the role of rotavirus as a cause of pancreatitis in children may be helpful.
