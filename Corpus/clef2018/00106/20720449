Circulating levels of visfatin, resistin and pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-8 in acute pancreatitis. Resistin and visfatin, hormones produced by adipose tissue, have pro-inflammatory potential however, their role in acute pancreatitis (AP) has been investigated only rarely.The study group comprised 32 patients with alcoholic AP and 30 controls. In all cases AP was classified as C according to Balthazar's CT score and as severe according to Ranson's criteria. The serum level of visfatin, resistin, and interleukin(IL)-8 immunoassays were measured by ELISA on admission and on the third and fifth day of hospitalization.On the admission day serum resistin and IL-8 concentrations in AP patients were significantly higher than in controls and they further increased on the third and fifth day of hospitalization. On the admission day serum visfatin levels in AP patients were significantly higher than in controls and further increased on the third day of hospitalization. On the fifth day the levels decreased however, they were still higher than on admission. The correlation between visfatin and resistin as well as between C-reactive protein and visfatin, resistin and IL-8 levels has been found.In the course of AP, visfatin and resistin levels increase in parallel with C-reactive protein. We speculate that those parameters may provide an additional tool for the prognosis and monitoring of AP. and IAP.
