Effect of pancreatic tissue sampling on serum pancreatic enzyme levels in clinically healthy dogs. Little is known about the potential consequences of pancreatic tissue sampling in dogs. The goal of the present study was to evaluate changes in serum trypsin-like immunoreactivity and canine-specific pancreatic lipase after pancreatic fine-needle aspiration and surgical biopsy in 27 clinically healthy dogs. Presurgical, ultrasound-guided aspiration of the pancreas was performed with the dogs under sedation. Subsequently, all the dogs underwent intraoperative pancreatic fine-needle aspiration and clamshell biopsy. After euthanasia, pancreata were sectioned for histopathologic evaluation. Serum pancreatic enzyme levels were measured at 3 time points: baseline, after ultrasound-guided aspiration, and after intraoperative aspiration and biopsy. No significant differences were detected among mean serum pancreatic lipase values at any point (P > 0.05). Serum trypsin-like immunoreactivity did not change from baseline (18.2 +/- 2.1 microg/dl mean +/- standard error) after ultrasound-guided aspiration (13.6 +/- 2.2 microg/dl) but increased significantly after intraoperative sampling (44.8 +/- 1.9 microg/dl
