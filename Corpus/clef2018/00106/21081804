Role of hormonal axis, growth hormone - IGF-1, in the therapeutic effect of ghrelin in the course of cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis. Ghrelin is a ligand for growth hormone secretagogue receptor and stimulates release of growth hormone (GH). Recent studies have shown that treatment with ghrelin exhibits protective and therapeutic effect in the course of experimental pancreatitis. The aim of present study was to examine the role of GH and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in these effects. Acute pancreatitis was induced by cerulein. Study was performed on pituitary-intact hypophysectomized rats. Ghrelin was administered twice a day at the dose of 8 nmol/kg/dose. IGF-1 was given twice a day at the dose of 20 nmol/kg/dose. The severity of acute pancreatitis was assessed 0 h or 1, 2, 3, 5 and 10 days after the last dose of cerulein. Administration of cerulein led to the development of acute edematous pancreatitis. In pituitary-intact rats, treatment with ghrelin reduced biochemical indexes of the severity of acute pancreatitis and morphological signs of pancreatic damage, leading to faster regeneration of the pancreas reduction in serum concentration of pro-inflammatory interleukin-1Î² and decrease in serum activity of amylase and lipase. These effects were accompanied with an improvement of pancreatic blood flow and an increase in pancreatic DNA synthesis. Hypophysectomy delayed the healing of the pancreas and abolished the therapeutic effect of ghrelin. In hypophysectomized rats with pancreatitis, treatment with IGF-1 exhibits therapeutic effect similar to that observed in ghrelin-treated rats with the intact pituitary. We conclude that therapeutic effect of ghrelin in cerulein-induced pancreatitis is indirect and depends on the release of GH and IGF-1.
