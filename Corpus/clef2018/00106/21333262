Acute pancreatitis may cause pancreaticopleural fistula. Pancreaticopleural fistula is a condition in which pancreatitic enzymes drain into the pleural cavity. It is a complication of pancreatic disease and usually presents with thoracic rather than abdominal symptoms. Although unusual, it should be included in the differential diagnosis to substantial and persistent unilateral pleural effusion. We report the case of a 71-year-old man who presented with dyspnoea. During two months, the patient underwent pulmonary evaluation before the pancreas was identified as the site of primary pathology. The key to the diagnosis was an elevated level of pleural fluid amylase.
