Pomalidomide suppresses cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in mice. An overproduction of proinflammatory mediators in severe acute pancreatitis contributes to the systemic inflammatory response, which may lead to multiorgan damage and even death. Thus, inflammatory cytokines, e.g., tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-1β, may be novel targets for the treatment of acute pancreatitis. The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effects of pomalidomide (or CC-4047), a thalidomide analog and immunomodulatory agent, in acute pancreatitis.Acute pancreatitis was induced in C57BL/6 mice by intraperitoneal administration of cerulein (100 μg/kg/h × 8). Pomalidomide was administered (0.5 mg/kg orally) 1 h before the first or 1 h after the last cerulein administration. The severity of the acute pancreatitis was evaluated biochemically and morphologically.Pretreatment with pomalidomide significantly reduced the plasma levels of amylase and lipase the histological injuryTreatment with pomalidomide ameliorated the severity of cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in mice. Our data suggest that pomalidomide may become a new therapeutic agent in future clinical trials for the treatment of acute pancreatitis.
