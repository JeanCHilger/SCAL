Protective effect of gum acacia against the aspirin induced intestinal and pancreatic alterations. The current study was carried out to examine the influence of aspirin (400 mg/kg of body weight) and gum acacia (one g/day) and their combination on pancreatic, intestinal mucosal enzymes, intestinal tissue iron and zinc after 21 days of treatment on experimental rats.The treated rats were sacrificed and the pancreatic and intestinal lipase and amylase were measured photometrically. Moreover, zinc and iron level were determined using atomic absorption spectrometry. Intestinal sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin.The results showed that treatment with aspirin caused a marked decrease in pancreatic lipase and amylase compared with that of the control group. This decrease in aspirin treated group was accompanied by significant increase in the intestinal amylase, lipase, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) compared with the control group. On the other hand, gum combined with aspirin caused a significant increase in pancreatic and intestinal lipase, amylase accompanied with significant increase in intestinal ALP and LDH compared with that of the control group. Concentration of Zn in wet weight of intestine showed a significant decrease in aspirin and aspirin combined with gum groups but it was increased significantly in gum acacia treated group. Histological analysis revealed intestinal epithelial damage in aspirin treated rats, this damage was not noticed with gum acacia treatment. Co-administration of gum in combination with aspirin indicated some changes of denuded intestinal mucosal cells compared with that of the control.Gum acacia exhibited a protective property that can ameliorate the alterations induced hazardous effect of aspirin treatment.
