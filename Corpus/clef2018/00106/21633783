Oxymatrine ameliorates L-arginine-induced acute pancreatitis in rats. The aim of this study was to determine whether oxymatrine has a protective effect against acute pancreatitis (AP) in a rat model of L-arginine-induced AP. AP was induced by two intraperitoneal injections of L-arginine (250 mg/100 g) at a 1-h interval. Oxymatrine (50 mg/kg) was administered every 6 h after the induction of AP. Oxymatrine significantly reduced the plasma amylase, D-lactic acid and tumor necrosis factor alpha concentration, serum diamine oxidase and lipase activity, and pancreatic myeloperoxidase activity, which were increased in AP rats (P < 0.05). In addition, the pancreatic CD45 expression and the expression of claudin-1, but not zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin, in the intestinal tissues were significantly reduced after the induction of AP. However, oxymatrine increased the expression of claudin-1 and CD45, but did not alter the expression of ZO-1 and occludin. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that oxymatrine is potentially capably of protecting against L-arginine-induced AP and attenuating AP-associated intestinal barrier injury by up-regulation of claudin-1.
