Point-of-care urine trypsinogen-2 test for diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. To assess a point-of-care urine trypsinogen-2 (UT) test for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.This was a prospective study of patients presenting to the emergency department with abdominal pain suggestive of acute pancreatitis. A 3-minute point-of-care UT test (Actim Pancreatitis Medix Biochemica, Kauniainen, Finland) was compared with final diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, which was based on suggestive clinical features, serum lipase and/or amylase levels and imaging.Of 124 patients included in this study, 69 patients had final diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. The sensitivity and specificity of UT were, respectively, 73.9% (95% CI 61.9% to 83.8%) and 94.6% (95% CI 84.9% to 98.9%).The point-of-care UT test for acute pancreatitis had good sensitivity and specificity, and can be used reliably at the bedside to make a positive diagnosis.
