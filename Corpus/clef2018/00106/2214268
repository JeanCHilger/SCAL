Effect of continuous arterial infusion of protease inhibitor on experimental acute pancreatitis induced by closed duodenal loop obstruction. The effectiveness of continuous arterial infusion of protease inhibitor on acute experimental pancreatitis was investigated. Acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis was induced by closed duodenal loop obstruction using mongrel dogs. The obstruction was released at 16 hr, and dogs were divided into three groups Group I: non-treated control, Group II: nafamostat mesilate (FUT-175) was admitted intravenously (5 micrograms/kg/min), Group III: FUT-175 was admitted via celiac artery. At 24 hr, the concentration of FUT-175 in the pancreatic tissues in group II and III were 905 and 4453 ng/g, respectively. The trypsin like activities in the pancreatic tissues in group I, II and III were 2.1, 1.4 and 0.7 nmol/min/mg protein, and the extent of necrosis of pancreatic parenchyma in each group were 49.5, 25.6 and 12.4%, respectively. Serum calcium, amylase and lipase levels were significantly improved in group III. These results suggest that continuous arterial infusion of protease inhibitor markedly decreases the extent of pancreatic necrosis in severe acute pancreatitis.
