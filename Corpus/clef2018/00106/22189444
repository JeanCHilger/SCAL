Does nuclear factor-kappa B in peripheral mononuclear cells have a prognostic role during acute necrotizing pancreatitis in rats? To investigate the prognostic role of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) during acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP) in rats.ANP was induced by an intravenous infusion of cerulein over 6 h superimposed on glycodeoxycholic acid (10 mmol/l) into the biliary-pancreatic duct for 10 min. The rats were divided into five groups and the first group served as the control. ANP was induced in the remaining groups, which were followed for 6, 12, 24 and 48 h. The mortality rate, serum amylase, alanine transferase (ALT), urea, creatinine and calcium, pancreatic histology, and NF-κB activity in PBMNCs were investigated. The NF-κB activity in PBMNCs was measured as two subunits of NF-κB, p50 and p65.A significant increase in mortality rate, pancreatic damage, serum activity of amylase and ALT, urea and NF-κB p65 activity in PBMNCs were observed. There was a significant correlation between the mortality rate and pancreatic damage in conjunction with time, but there was no correlation between NF-κB p65 activity in PBMNCs and the mortality rate.The measurement of p65 levels of NF-kB in PBMNCs has no prognostic role during ANP in rats.
