Pancreatitis in the setting of the metabolic syndrome. There is paucity of literature on the relation of obesity with recurrent and chronic pancreatitis. We recorded the clinical details and the outcome of five patients with recurrent pancreatitis who had components of the metabolic syndrome. Their age ranged from 8 to 20 years. All five patients had acanthosis nigricans. Body mass index (BMI) could not be evaluated as these patients lost weight following episodes of pancreatitis. Three patients had two or more first-degree relatives who had diabetes mellitus. Only one patient had severe necrotizing pancreatitis. Coexisting liver disease was seen in two patients. Elevated serum cholesterol levels and moderately elevated serum triglycerides along with elevated serum amylase levels observed in these patients suggest possibility of a different mechanism from that of hypertriglyceridemia-related pancreatitis. Evaluation of pancreatic steatosis should be considered in patients with pancreatitis in the setting of metabolic syndrome.
