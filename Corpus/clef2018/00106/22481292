Incidence of hyperamylasemia after endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration of pancreatic lesions: a multicenter study from China. There have been few reports regarding the incidence of hyperamylasemia after endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA). In particular, the potential risk factors involved in the development of hyperamylasemia have not been analyzed owing to the small number of cases reported. The aim of this study was to evaluate hyperamylasemia and associated risk factors after EUS-FNA of a large sample of pancreatic lesions.Patients who underwent EUS-FNA for treatment of a pancreatic lesion were recruited from 6 medical centers in China.A total of 1023 patients presenting with pancreatic lesions between January 2004 and June 2008 were enrolled in this study, with 48 (4.7%) of the 1023 patients presenting with hyperamylasemia 3 hours after the procedure. These patients had a mean ± SD serum amylase level of 331.64 ± 138.60 UI/L. With the use of unconditional logistic regression analysis, the incidence of hyperamylasemia was found to be affected by the type of cystic lesion present and the gauge of the needle used. In 4 (0.4%) of the 1023 patients, acute pancreatitis developed.The overall incidence of hyperamylasemia after EUS-FNA is relatively low. However, the type of cystic lesion present and the gauge of the needle (19G) used for EUS-FNA may represent risk factors for the incidence of hyperamylasemia.
