Do opioid receptors play a role in the pathogenesis of the inflammatory response in acute pancreatitis? To investigate the effect of the opioid blocker naltrexone in the inflammatory response in acute pancreatitis (AP).Acute pancreatitis was induced in anesthetized male Wistar rats by retrograde injection of 2.5% sodium taurocholate diluted in 0.5ml saline into the main pancreatic duct. Animals were randomized to the following experimental groups: Control Group (n=9): animals received an intraperitoneal injection of saline solution (0.5ml), 15 minutes before the induction of AP. Naltrexone Group (n=9): animals received an intraperitoneal injection of naltrexone 0.5ml (15 mg/kg), 15 minutes before induction of AP. Peritoneal levels of TNF-Î± and serum levels of IL-6 and amylase were determined The volume of the ascitic fluid was also evaluated. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities were analyzed in homogenates of pulmonary tissue.There were no significant differences in the ascitic fluid volume, nor in TNF-a and IL-6 levels in the naltrexone group compared to controls. Treatment with naltrexone did not affect the lung MPO activity compared to control group.The opioid receptors don't play an important role in the pathogenesis of the inflammatory response in acute pancreatitis. If opioids affect leukocytes inflammatory signaling, there are no major implications in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis.
