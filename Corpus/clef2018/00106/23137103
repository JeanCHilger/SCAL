Effect of short-term propofol administration on pancreatic enzymes and lipid biochemistry in children between 1 month and 36 months. Use of propofol in pediatric age group has been marred by reports of its adverse effects like hypertriglyceridemia and acute pancreatitis, although a causal relation has not yet been established.This prospective, clinical trial was carried out to evaluate the effects of short-term propofol administration on serum lipid profile and serum pancreatic enzymes in children of ASA physical status I and II aged between 1 month and 36 months.Anesthesia was induced with Propofol (1%) in the dose of 3 mg·kg(-1) intravenously and was maintained by propofol infusion (0.5%) at the rate of 12 mg·kg(-1·) h(-1) for the first 20 min and at 8 mg·kg(-1·) h(-1) thereafter. The mean dose of propofol administered was 12.02 ± 2.75 mg·kg(-1) (fat load of 120.2 ± 27.5 mg·kg(-1) ). Lipid profile, serum amylase, and lipase were measured before induction of anesthesia, at 90 min, 4 h, and finally 24 h after induction.Serum lipase levels (P < 0.05), serum triglyceride levels (P < 0.05), and serum very low-density lipoproteins VLDL levels (P < 0.05) were raised significantly after propofol administration from baseline although remained within normal limits. Serum cholesterol levels and serum low-density lipoproteins LDL levels showed a statistically significant fall over 24 h. No significant changes in serum pancreatic amylase levels were seen (P > 0.05). None of the patients developed any clinical features of pancreatitis in the postoperative period.We conclude that despite a small, transient increase in serum triglycerides and pancreatic enzymes, short-term propofol administration in recommended dosages in children of ASA status I and II aged between 1 month and 36 months does not produce any clinically significant effect on serum lipids and pancreatic enzymes.
