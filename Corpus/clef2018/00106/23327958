The effects of ω-3 fish oil lipid emulsion on inflammation-immune response and organ function in patients with severe acute pancreatitis. To investigate the effects of ω-3 fish oil lipid emulsion via vein on the inflammatory response, immune and organ function in patients with severe acute pancreatitis.A total of 53 patients with severe acute pancreatitis were randomized into conventional therapy plus fish oil group (FO group) and conventional therapy group (CON group). The patients in FO group were treat with ω-3 fish oil lipid emulsion (0.2 g×kg(-1)×d(-1), 10%) based on conventional therapy for 14 days. The level of C-reactive protein (CRP), TG and TC were detected before treatment and at day 7 and day 14 after treatment. CD(4)(+), CD(4)(+)/CD(8)(+) and C(3), C(4) were also detected at day 1 and day 14 after treatment. At the same time, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score (APACHEII score), intra-abdominal pressure, negative fluid balance time, enteral nutrition start-time and ICU stay time were observed and recorded.Forty-five out of 53 patients were finally recruited into results statistics. The level of CD(4)(+), CD(4)(+)/CD(8)(+) and C(3) at day 14 after treatment in FO groups improved significantly than that in the CON group (P < 0.05). The levels of CRP, intra-abdominal pressure and APACHE II score at day 7 and day 14 in FO group descended more obviously than that in the CON group (P < 0.05). The negative liquid balance time in FO group (3.55 ± 0.86)days was obvious shorter than that in CON group (4.61 ± 1.12) days, while enteral nutrition start-time (3.86 ± 1.17) days was significantly earlier compared with CON group (5.30 ± 1.61) days (P < 0.05), however ICU stay time and 28 days mortality rate had no significant difference between the two groups.ω-3 fish oil lipid emulsion can decrease the inflammatory response and the negative liquid balance time, improve the immune function and restore bowel function in severe acute pancreatitis patients. Therefore, it maybe provide a new and effective means for severe acute pancreatitis.
