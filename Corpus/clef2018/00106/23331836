Ectopic pancreas presenting with pancreatitis and a mesenteric mass. Ectopic pancreas is defined by the presence of abnormally situated pancreatic tissue that lacks contact with normal pancreas and possesses its own duct system and vascular supply. Ectopic pancreas in the gastrointestinal tract is not uncommon. Moreover, there are several reported cases of adult ectopic pancreatitis in the literature, but to date, only two cases of pediatric ectopic pancreatitis have been reported. We describe a 15-year-old female with acute right upper quadrant pain and elevated serum lipase and amylase, in whom the radiological diagnosis was mesenteric soft tissue mass with adjacent inflammatory changes. The surgical pathology diagnosis, however, was mesenteric ectopic pancreas complicated by pancreatitis. We advocate for ectopic pancreatitis to be considered in a pediatric patient with acute abdominal pain, laboratory findings consistent with pancreatitis, and imaging findings of a mesenteric mass and normal orthotopic pancreas.
