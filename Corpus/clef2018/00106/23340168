The role of TRAIL signal pathway in acute pancreatitis. The incidence of acute pancreatitis has been increasing recently. This study aims to elucidatethe role of TRAIL signal pathway in the process of acute pancreatitis.Pancreatitis models were constructed by cerulein or cerulein plus lipopolysaccharide. Amylase and lipidase were measured in different groups. The mRNA expression of TRAIL, DR5, DcR1 and DcR2 were studied by means of relative Quantitative-Real-Time PCR. In addition, the expression of TUNEL and Caspase 3 was studied by immunohistochemistry.The establishment of pancreatitis model was successful. There were significant differences of amylase and lipidase in the three groups (p<0.05), with highest in MAP group. The mRNA expression of TRAIL was upregulated in SAP group and downregulated in MAP group. The expressions of DcR1 were detected to be statistically upregulated in MAP group and SAP group. The expressions of DR5 and DcR2 were not significant different from each other among the three groups (p>0.05). There were no siginificant differences among the three groups for the expression of Caspase 3 which indicated the apoptosis of acinar cell. The correlation coefficient between the expression of TUNEL and Caspase 3 was 0.383 (p=0.037).TRAIL signal pathway might play a role in the process of acute pancreatitis which needs to be explored further.
