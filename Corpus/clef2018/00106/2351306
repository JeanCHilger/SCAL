Pancreatic pseudocyst causing portal vein thrombosis and pancreatico-pleural fistula. Portal vein thrombosis and pancreatico-pleural fistula are unusual complications of chronic pancreatitis. We describe a patient with chronic alcoholic pancreatitis in whom erosion of the splenic vein led to portal vein thrombosis and to the development of a pancreatico-pleural fistula. We suggest that fistula formation may occur over a considerable time period as the portal vein thrombosis was diagnosed three years before the amylase-rich pleural effusions.
