Evaluation of biliary and pancreatic function in pancreolithiasis. Value of the determination of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. Ten patients with pancreolithiasis and ten controls underwent a 110-minute pancreozymin-secretion test in which post-pancreozymin collection periods were prolonged to 30 minutes. Gamma-Glutamyl transpeptidase concentrations and outputs of duodenal aspirate in response to pancreozymin and to secretin were greatly increased in patients with pancreolithiasis. No correlation was noted between gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and bile pigment concentrations. The mean concentrations and outputs of amylase in disease were much less than those in control subjects throughout the test. Two categories of pancreolithiasis were distinguished with respect to the distribution and size of the calculi and amylase secretion. We suggest that, in pancreolithiasis, there is an increase in ductal or centroacinar cell mass.
