Contrasts and comparisons between childhood and adult onset acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis (AP) in children is an increasingly recognised clinical entity notably different from the adults with respect to incidence, aetiology, severity and outcome. Yet our current understanding and approach to the management of paediatric pancreatitis is based almost entirely on adult studies. Acute recurrent pancreatitis (ARP) in children is more likely associated with various genetic factors, some of which have been relatively well characterised and others are in an evolving phase. The aim of this review is to summarise current knowledge, highlight any recent advances and contrast the paediatric and adult forms of this condition.
