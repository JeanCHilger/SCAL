Acute pancreatitis of biliary etiology. A retrospective study has been carried out, comparing 87 patients with acute pancreatitis of biliary etiology and 53 patients with pancreatitis secondary to other causes. The clinical presentation, laboratory data, radiological findings (chest X-rays, radiography of the abdomen and gastrointestinal, echography), morbidity and mortality have been analyzed. In acute pancreatitis related to biliary disease, pain is most frequently located in the right hypochondrium and the levels of amylase, GOT, GPT an alkaline phosphatase were higher, although only the last two parameters showed significant differences. Morbidity (local and general complications) did not show differences in both groups, but mortality was higher in pancreatitis secondary to biliary disease (5.6% compared to 3.7%).
