Acute pancreatitis and biochemical markers. Isoamylase. Amylase activity in blood and urine, lipase activity in blood, and amylase/creatinine clearance ratio have been prospectively compared in order to test these parameters against estimation of pancreatic isoamylase. Pancreatic isoamylase had been evaluated by inhibition methodology and not by electrophoresis. One hundred patients admitted for strictly sus-umbilical abdominal pain in emergency unit have been studied. Results show that we do not have in blood specific biochemical marker for acute pancreatitis. Lipase and P isoamylase activity evaluation have about the same specificity. In emergency situation the choice of routine investigation will be rather based on methodological simplicity and lower cost.
