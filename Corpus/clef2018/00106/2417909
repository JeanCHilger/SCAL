Effect of obstructive jaundice on amylase secretion in rat pancreatic acini. The effect of obstructive jaundice on pancreatic amylase secretion was studied in isolated pancreatic acini prepared from bile duct ligated rats (7 days postoperatively), sham operated rats being used as control. Obstructive jaundice caused increase in pancreatic wet weight, pancreatic protein content and pancreatic amylase content by 27.9%, 40.1% and 33.2%, respectively. In acini prepared from obstructive jaundice group, compared with acini from sham operation group, responsiveness to cholecystokinin (CCK) and carbachol was decreased when amylase release was expressed as the percentage of total amylase activity initially present in acini. However, sensitivity to both secretagogues was unchanged when expressed as the percentage of maximally stimulated amylase release. The dose-response curves to Ca2+ ionophore for amylase release were similarly shaped in both groups. These results suggested that a pancreatico-trophic effect, compared with altered responsiveness of pancreatic acini, should play a major role in hypersecretion in obstructive jaundice.
