Pancreatic injury secondary to renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury: possible role of oxidative stress. Recent studies demonstrated remote effects of renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury on some organs such as brain, liver, and lungs. We investigated the effects of renal I-R injury on function, histology and oxidative stress state of pancreas. Twenty-four male adult Sprague-Dawley rats were divided equally into 2 groups sham group: rats underwent midline laparotomy and dissection of renal pedicles without renal ischemia, and ischemic group: rats underwent bilateral renal ischemia for 45 min. Renal functions (serum creatinine and BUN), pancreatic functions (serum amylase, lipase and insulin) and fasting blood glucose were measured at 2 h, 1 day, 3 days and 7 days after ischemia. Also, pancreatic histology and malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase and reduced glutathione (GSH) were examined at 2 h and 7 days after ischemia. The ischemic rats showed significant increase in serum creatinine and BUN with significant increase in serum amylase and lipase at 2 h, 1 day and 3 days after ischemia. Blood glucose and fasting insulin showed no significant change apart from significant increase in insulin in sham group at 1 day after ischemia. Pancreas isolated from ischemic rats showed significant increase in histopathological damage score and significant increase in MDA and catalase enzyme with decrease in GSH. In conclusion, bilateral renal ischemia for 45 min caused significant impairment of pancreatic functions and histology. This might be due to deficiency of antioxidant and increased lipid peroxidations in pancreatic tissues.
