Effects of somatostatin and a somatostatin agonist on diet-induced pancreatitis in mice. We examined the effects of somatostatin-14 and the potent somatostatin agonist (N-acetyl-[Des(Ala1,Gly2),p-Cl-Phe6,D-Trp8]-somatostatin amide) on choline deficient, ethionine enriched diet (CDED)-induced acute pancreatitis in mice. Serum amylase determinations were performed, and specimens from the pancreas were examined by light and electron microscopy. No significant beneficial effects of somatostatin or its agonist were found in this model of acute pancreatitis.
