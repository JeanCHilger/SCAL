Exocrine pancreatic function among diabetic patients in Thailand. Pancreozymin-secretin-stimulated secretion was measured for volume, bicarbonate concentration and total amylase output in 16 noninsulin-dependent patients and 23 age-, sex-, and weight-matched similar control subjects. Another group of 17 insulin-dependent patients was studied using secretin stimulation and the secretory response compared to a similar group of 37 control subjects. Pancreozymin-secretin-stimulated pancreatic function was normal in noninsulin-dependent patients. Abnormal values for at least one parameter of secretion were found in 82% of insulin-dependent patients. Amylase output was low in 35% and bicarbonate concentration was low in 30%. Hypersecretion occurred in 35%. One patient had abnormal values for all three parameters and three patients had two abnormal values. Hypersecretory response to secretin stimulation is considered to be an early finding of pancreatic exocrine dysfunction among insulin-dependent patients. Progressive secretory failure occurs as the pathological process increases, and a decrease in total amylase output becomes the most significant abnormality.
