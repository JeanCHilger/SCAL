Effect of somatostatin on hyperamylasemia following endoscopic pancreatography. Prophylactic somatostatin (Stillamin, Serono) was given i.v. to 26 patients for 24 hours (250 micrograms/h) in order to reduce the incidence and severity of hyperamylasemia and pancreatitis following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Patients who during the preceding year had been subjected to ERCP served as historical controls. The incidence of hyperamylasemia following ERCP was 58% and 57% in somatostatin-treated patients and controls, respectively. There was no significant difference between the serum amylase levels in the controls and in patients given prophylactic somatostatin. No patient developed clinically overt pancreatitis. It is concluded that prophylactic somatostatin does not reduce the incidence or severity of hyperamylasemia following ERCP.
