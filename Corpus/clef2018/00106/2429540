Effect of niacin and niacin-tryptophan deficiency on pancreatic acinar cell function in rats in vitro. To determine the effect of niacin deficiency on pancreas, rats were fed a standard rat chow ad libitum or an equal amount of a niacin-deficient or niacin-sufficient diet in the first experiment, or of a niacin-tryptophan-deficient or niacin-tryptophan-sufficient diet in the second experiment. Niacin deficiency decreased tissue chymotrypsinogen and trypsinogen content amylase, chymotrypsinogen, and trypsinogen concentration
