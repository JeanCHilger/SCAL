The diagnostic benefits of lipase values in acute pancreatitis. Serum lipase is a biochemical marker used for diagnosing acute pancreatitis. Lipase has largely replaced amylase in terms of diagnostic value, although both markers are still commonly used. In this publication, we discuss the diagnostic superiority of lipase compared to amylase in acute pancreatitis. Two cases are discussed both patients presented with elevated lipase values but due to different causes. The first patient, who had recently experienced cholecystitis, presented to the emergency room with abdominal pain and high lipase levels. The second patient, who had received a renal transplant a few years earlier, visited the gastroenterological outpatient clinic with abdominal pain and only a slightly elevated lipase level.
