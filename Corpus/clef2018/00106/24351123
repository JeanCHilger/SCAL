Clinical characteristics of patients after dicamba herbicide ingestion. Despite a widespread use of dicamba herbicide and numerous animal model studies, there had not been studies on acute toxicity of this chemical compound in human subjects following ingestion. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate clinical characteristics of dicamba poisoning and to guide physicians treating patients intoxicated with dicamba herbicide.A retrospective observational case series was conducted for 14 patients with history of dicamba herbicide ingestion. Data were collected for clinical manifestation, patient management, and final outcome.The most common symptom was altered mental state (Glasgow Coma Scale â‰¤ 14). Laboratory abnormalities were elevations in lactate, and creatine kinase, metabolic acidosis (pH < 7.35, and HCO3(-) < 20 mmol/L), and elevated lipase. QTc prolongation was commonly observed. These abnormal clinical findings had normalized within two days of supportive treatment after dicamba ingestion. One patient did demonstrate corrosive esophagitis.Acute toxicity of dicamba herbicide in human following oral exposure was manageable with supportive treatment. However, physician should take into account for corrosive effect on GI tract, rhabdomyolysis, or acute pancreatitis.
