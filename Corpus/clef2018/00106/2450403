Treatment of mild exacerbations of recurrent alcoholic pancreatitis in an emergency department observation unit. Patients with mild exacerbations of recurrent alcoholic pancreatitis are occasionally treated in the emergency department observation unit with parenteral hydration and analgesia in hopes of avoiding hospitalization. To determine whether such treatment is efficacious and cost-effective, we reviewed 27 consecutive admissions to the emergency department observation unit for exacerbation of previously documented recurrent alcoholic pancreatitis. For comparison, we studied 27 randomly selected, matched patients admitted directly to the hospital. Of the 27 admitted to the observation unit, 14 (52%) improved sufficiently for discharge in less than 24 hours (group A mean duration of observation, 14.4 hours)
