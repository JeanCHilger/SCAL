Clinical significance for monitoring of serum ghrelin in acute pancreatitis severity assessment. To explore the value of altered serum level of Ghrelin for severity assessment in patients with acute pancreatitis (AP).Peripheral blood samples were collected from 47 AP patients at admission, 48 hours post-admission and at discharge. According to the criteria of APACHEII score ≥ 8, RANSON ≥ 3, CT ≥ 4, they were divided into mild (n = 17) and severe (n = 30) groups. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure the serum level of Ghrelin. And correlation analysis was made with the score of APACHEII and the level of C reactive protein (CRP). Also the serum level of Ghrelin was analyzed with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.The serum levels of Ghrelin after 24 h were 358.6 ± 119.3 vs 212.1 ± 42.7 ng/L (P < 0.001) after 48 hours, 253.1 ± 71.2 vs 275.5 ± 73.6 ng/L (P = 0.572)The serum level of Ghrelin during early-stage AP has significant differences between two groups. And it may become an early predictor of pancreatic necrosis and a degree marker of clinical severity.
