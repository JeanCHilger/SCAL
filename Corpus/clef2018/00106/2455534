Alterations with time of secretion and ultrastructure of the exocrine pancreas in rats with an obstructed biliary system. The effects of biliary obstruction on the secretory activity and ultrastructure of the exocrine pancreas were studied in rats. Increased volume, protein and amylase secretion were observed in the early periods, under basal conditions and in response to cerulein-secretin stimulation. Bicarbonate concentrations in the pancreatic juice were not significantly altered during the experiments, under either basal or stimulated conditions. The wet weight of the pancreas, and the tissue protein and amylase content of the pancreas increased progressively after bile duct ligation, under basal conditions. Morphological changes were marked in the acinar cells, the most characteristic being an increase in the size and number of zymogen granules and dilatation of the Golgi cisternae. These findings demonstrate a hyperfunctional state of the acinar cells following progressive suppression of granule discharge. It is suggested that the inhibition of granule discharge from acinar cells in rats with prolonged bile duct ligation may be due to the cytotoxic effects of hyperbilirubinemia and inhibition of normal mitochondrial function.
