Hyperamylasemia is associated with increased intestinal permeability in patients undergoing diagnostic oral double-balloon enteroscopy. To investigate the correlations between serum amylase levels, intestinal permeability (IP), and pancreatic injury and to explore the mechanisms responsible for hyperamylasemia in double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE).A prospective study was conducted in 20 patients who underwent DBE from August 1, 2008 to February 28, 2009. Serum amylase was examined 0, 2, 6 and 24 h post-DBE, C-reactive protein and lipase were examined at 24 h, and urine lactulose, mannitol, and trypsinogen-II (TRY-II) levels were measured at 6 h. Lactulose/mannitol ratio indicated IP, and TRY-II indicated pancreatic injuries. Procedure duration and enteroscope insertion length were recorded.Twelve patients underwent oral DBE (M:F, 5:7 mean age 50.42 Â± 11.11 years) and 8 underwent anal DBE (M:F, 5:3Hyperamylasemia correlates with increased IP and clinically undetectable pancreatic injuries. DBE could cause intestinal mucosa damage, which may result in IP elevation and increased amylase absorption, necessitating improvements and standardization of DBE methods.
