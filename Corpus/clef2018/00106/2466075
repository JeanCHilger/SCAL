Serum amylase, isoamylase, and lipase in the acute abdomen. Their diagnostic value for acute pancreatitis. We evaluated the diagnostic value of serum amylase, isoamylase, and lipase for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis from sera of patients with acute abdominal pain. Comparison was first made in condition A between 32 patients with image-proven pancreatitis and 414 patients with nonpancreatic acute abdomen (the control group), then in condition B, between 62 pancreatitis patients with or without image proof and the control group. We found (a) that patients with image-proven pancreatitis suffer a more severe clinical course than those without (b) that the sensitivity, positive predictive value, and accuracy in condition B are higher than in condition A at any cutoff level
