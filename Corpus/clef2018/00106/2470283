Major hypertriglyceridemia, associated with severe acute pancreatitis, successfully treated with plasma exchange. A 27 year-old alcoholic patient with severe acute pancreatitis (4 Ranson's objective prognostic signs), complained of abdominal pain and vomiting and presented fever and rigors. The plasma was of milky turbidity and the concentration of triglycerides (TG) very high (26 Mmol/l, Normal: 3-1.6). Serum pancreatic amylase was elevated (262 U/l, Normal: 10-200). The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed S-T depression. The diagnosis was confirmed by computed tomography which showed a pancreatic phlegmon and a collection in the left pararenal space (Ranson's grade D). After PE on days 1 and 2: the amylase became normal, plasma clear, TG decreased (7.8 Mmol/l), the clinical picture improved and the ECG normal. Assisted ventilation was necessary over 10 days. Pancreatic morphology remained unchanged. The patient was discharged to intensive care on day 18. There was no indication for surgery. The fast drop in TG levels, the precursors of free fatty acids, may have limited their toxicity the pancreas, allowing a difficult stage to be over come and the course of the illness to interrupted. Normalization of the ECG requires emphasis. The association of HG, increased plasma amylase and abdominal pain justifies early iterative PE.
