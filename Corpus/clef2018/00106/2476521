Pancreatic calcifications in patients with normal pancreatic function. This is a report on five patients who had acute attacks of pancreatitis (three cases complicated by pseudocysts). They all showed pancreatic calcifications on plain abdominal X-ray (n = 5), computed tomography (n = 3), or at postmortem examination (n = 1). Despite calcifications, the exocrine pancreatic function, as tested with the secretin-pancreozymin test and fecal fat analysis, was either normal or returned to normal. The conclusion is that pancreatic calcifications do not indicate severe exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and the necessity for pancreatic enzyme substitution. Calcifications are not necessarily a sign of chronic pancreatitis. They may result rather from scars following acute pancreatitis.
