Study on the trophic effect of camostate mesilate on ethionine-induced pancreatic injury rat. Pancreatic injury was induced to rats with intraperitoneal injection of ethionine 60 mg per 100 g BW twice or three times weekly for 6 weeks. These rats were given 100 mg/kg of Camostate mesilate (CM) via a gastric tube daily for 14 days. CM administration resulted in an increase of pancreatic wet weight, hypertrophy and hyperplasia of acinar cells, and an increase of exocrine pancreatic function. Acini prepared from CM and ethionine-treated rats exhibited increased response to caerulein, but decreased sensitivity to caerulein. The plasma CCK level in rats with CM administration 24 hours later was higher than that without CM administration. However, there were no significant changes in plasma CCK and secretin level thereafter. We concluded that CM had a trophic effect on the pancrease with ethionine-induced pancreatic injury, and CCK was considered playing the same role in injured pancreas as the normal rat pancreas. Studies using CCK receptor antagonist are needed for further clarification.
