Protective effect of a protein-free diet in acute experimental pancreatitis. 1. Survival time, amylase activity and pancreatic protein, DNA and RNA content were measured in 38 control rats and in 104 rats injected with sodium taurocholate to induce acute pancreatitis after 21 days on one of four diets differing in protein, lipid and carbohydrate content. 2. All of the parameters measured were lower in rats with pancreatitis than in controls maintained on the same diets. Among the rats with pancreatitis, those receiving a protein-free diet survived longer and had significantly higher DNA, lower amylase activity and lower RNA and protein levels than those receiving a balanced diet or one that was high in protein or lipid content. 3. We conclude that acute pancreatitis in rats has a more benign course in protein-undernourished animals.
