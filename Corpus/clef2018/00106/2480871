Role of zinc in treatment of experimental acute pancreatitis in mice. A study on the effect of zinc feeding on the survival rate as well as the levels of trypsinogen, alpha 2-macroglobulin, zinc, calcium, and magnesium in the plasma, pancreata, and livers of BALB/c mice fed a choline-deficient diet supplemented with 0.5% DL-ethionine (CDE diet) was undertaken. Feeding them a zinc-excess diet significantly increased the survival rate of mice with pancreatitis induced by CDE diet feeding. Trypsinogen concentrations in plasma and pancreas increased in mice fed a CDE diet and further increased in mice fed a zinc-deficient diet. The plasma alpha 2-macroglobulin levels in mice fed a zinc-deficient diet decreased compared to those fed a zinc-adequate or a zinc-excess diet. In mice with pancreatitis, zinc and calcium concentrations of pancreata increased and magnesium concentrations decreased compared to those of normal controls. The calcium concentrations in both livers and pancreata increased, but magnesium concentrations in these tissues decreased. These results suggest that altered mineral metabolism in the pancreas may have contributed to the pathophysiology of the mice with acute pancreatitis and that zinc supplementation in the diet may be therapeutic for pancreatitis.
