Acute necrotizing pancreatitis: laboratory, clinical, and imaging findings as predictors of patient outcome. In patients with acute necrotizing pancreatitis, we analyzed whether laboratory and clinical findings determined in the early phase of disease and morphologic features on contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) at the beginning of the late phase of disease are helpful in predicting patient outcome and whether CECT findings provide additional information in establishing prognosis compared with the laboratory and clinical findings.A retrospective analysis of 99 patients with acute necrotizing pancreatitis was performed. Four laboratory variables (albumin, calcium, C-reactive protein, WBC count) and three clinical variables (Acute Physiology, Age, Chronic Health Evaluation [APACHE] II score Simplified Acute Physiology Score [SAPS] IIIn our study population of 99 patients (63 men, 36 women median age, 52 yearsIn patients with suspected or proven acute necrotizing pancreatitis, performing CECT at the beginning of the late phase of disease is recommended to identify patients at increased risk for adverse outcomes.
