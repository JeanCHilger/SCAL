Hypertriglyceridemia and pancreatitis in a patient with apolipoprotein E7 (p.[E244K E245K])/E4. The etiology of hypertriglyceridemia is complex and one of the common variants in affecting plasma lipid levels is apolipoprotein (apo) E isoform. Scores of apo E variants have been reported, including apo E7. However, a clinical lipid phenotype of apo E7 has not been fully elucidated.A 48-year-old Japanese male had hypertriglyceridemia and a history of repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis. The measurement of serum apolipoproteins and apo E phenotyping, and the sequencing analyses of several genes regulating triglyceride metabolism were performed in the patient.The apo E phenotype of the patient was E7/E4. Apo E7 had the same point mutations p.[E244K E245K] in APOE as reported previously. In addition, he had APOA5 haplotypes associated with hypertriglyceridemia. Laboratory examinations excluded deficiency of apolipoproteins, lipoprotein lipase, and GPI-HBP1 in this patient.This is, to our knowledge, the first report of severe hypertriglyceridemia and acute pancreatitis in a patient with apo E7.
