Use of CT and MRI in emergency department patients with acute pancreatitis. Assess the utility of CT and MRI in patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) presenting to emergency department (ED).In this Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective study, we identified all patients with AP from March 2012 through February 2013 in ED of a teaching hospital with approximately 60,000 annual visits. Patients were initially identified via ICD-9 code for AP (577.0) diagnosis was confirmed by chart review using established diagnostic criteria (presence of two of the following: typical abdominal pain, elevated lipase/amylase >3 times normal, or imaging findings of pancreatitis). Abdominal CT or MRI obtained in the ED and within 24 h of admission was reviewed by a fellowship-trained abdominal radiologist.Of 101 patients admitted with AP (60 women, 41 men mean age 52 years, range 20-89), 63 (62.4%) underwent imagingEarly imaging is common in patients with AP, even when the diagnosis can be established based on non-imaging criteria, rarely demonstrating pancreatic necrosis. Reducing overuse of early imaging in patients with confident diagnosis of AP may improve quality and reduce waste.
