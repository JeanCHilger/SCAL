The role of D-dimer in prediction of the course and outcome in pediatric acute pancreatitis. Current predictive severity scores for pediatric acute pancreatitis are either extrapolated from adult studies or difficult to use in practice. The aim of this study was to assess the value of the plasma D-dimer level as a marker of severity and outcome in pediatric AP.36 patients (aged 1-17 yrs) with AP were included in the study. Levels of D-dimer and other routine laboratory parameters for AP were determined on admission. The Pediatric Acute Pancreatitis Severity Score was used to assess disease severity. The development of systemic and local complications was also recorded.D-dimer level was significantly higher in a group of patients with complications, median 1189.5 (271-4800) vs 172.5 (105-1086) in a group of patients without complications (p < 0.001). D-dimer showed high precision in the prediction of acute necrotic collection, with the optimal cut-off values of 442.5 μg/L, Sensitivity (Sn) 100%, Specificity (Sp) 62.1% and in the prediction of multiple organ failure with optimal cut-off value 1189 μg/L, Sn 100% and Sp 87.5%. According to the areas under the curve (AUCs) of each parameter, D-dimer seemed to have predictive power similar to PAPS score and higher than C-reactive protein and Lactate dehydrogenase level.D-dimer level may be a simple clinical predictor of severity in pediatric acute pancreatitis.
