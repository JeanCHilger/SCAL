Intramuscular diclofenac for the prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis: a randomized trial. Rectal nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been shown to reduce the incidence of postendoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis (PEP). The aim of this study was to determine whether intramuscular diclofenac reduces the risk of PEP.Patients who underwent ERCP were randomized to receive either 90 mg of diclofenac or placebo by intramuscular injection immediately after the procedure. PEP was defined as elevated serum amylase levels (at least three times the upper limit of normal 24 hours after the procedure) associated with new or worsened upper abdominal, epigastric, or back pain.In total, 380 patients were randomized, and 343 were eligible for analysis. The two groups were similar regarding clinical and demographic factors, as well as patient- and procedure-related risk factors for PEP. PEP developed in 20/170 patients (11.8 %) in the placebo group and in 22/173 patients (12.7 %) in the diclofenac group (P = 0.87). Multivariate regression analysis failed to illustrate that intramuscular diclofenac prevented PEP (odds ratio 0.79 95 % confidence interval 0.39 - 1.25Prophylactic intramuscular diclofenac had no beneficial preventive effect on PEP.Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01717599.
