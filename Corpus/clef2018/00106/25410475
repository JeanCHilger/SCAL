Relationship between the degree of severe acute pancreatitis and patient immunity. To investigate the relationship between the APACHE II score and the immunity of patients with severe acute pancreatitis.Clinical data were collected from 88 patients with acute pancreatitis, divided into four groups according to the severity of the disease. C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-Î±, interleukin-6, interleukin-10, interleukin-4 and endotoxin (ET) in serum were measured on admission and then on days 3, 5, and 7.The incidence of local complications and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome increased with a higher APACHE II score. The CRP levels were increased significantly on day 3 in all four groups, but remained high only in the extremely severe group. In the mild and moderate groups, the pro-/anti-inflammatory cytokines peaked on day 3 and then decreased slowly. In the severe and extremely severe groups, the proinflammatory cytokines levels peaked on days 3 and 5, and then decreased rapidly. The antiinflammatory cytokines increased progressively on days 3, 5 and 7. The ET levels peaked significantly and then decreased slowly in the mild, moderate and severe groups, but remained high in the extremely severe group.An APACHE II score of 16 or higher is predictive of more local and systemic complications, excessive immune response, and premature immunosuppression.
