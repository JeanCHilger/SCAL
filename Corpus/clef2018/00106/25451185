Detrimental effect of high volume fluid administration in acute pancreatitis - a retrospective analysis of 391 patients. Early fluid resuscitation is recommended for the therapy of acute pancreatitis in order to prevent complications. There are, however, no convincing data supporting this approach.We reviewed 391 consecutive cases of confirmed acute pancreatitis. Admitting physicians had been advised to administer an aggressive fluid resuscitation in the early phase of disease, if possible. We tested whether disease severity according to the revised Atlanta Classification, local complications, and maximum C-reactive protein levels were predictable by the initial volume therapy in logistic and linear regression models, respectively. We also determined which parameters on admission encouraged a more aggressive fluid resuscitation.The recorded fluid administered within the first 24 h was 5300 [3760 7100] ml (median [1stWe found detrimental effects of fluid therapy on major outcome parameters throughout the whole range of administered volume. More volume was administered in younger patients and in patients with evidence of hemoconcentration and inflammation. The adverse effects of volume therapy persisted after elimination of these parameters. Caution should therefore be advised with regards to volume therapy in patients with acute pancreatitis.
