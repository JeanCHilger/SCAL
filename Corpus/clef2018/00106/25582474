Experience in diagnosis and treatment of asparaginase-associated pancreatitis in children. To analyze the clinical characteristics and the course of diagnosis and therapy of PEG-asparaginase associated pancreatitis (AAP) in childhood, and to reveal the pathophysiology of AAP, enhance the ability of diagnosis and treament.Data of 13 cases with AAP in childhood seen from March 2011 to March 2014 were analyzed with regard to clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, imaging feature and treatment.AAP was found in 12 of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 1 of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), 8 were boys and 5 were girls, with a mean age 6 years. In 12 cases AAP occurred during the induction-remission treatment, in 1 case during the maintenance- intensification phase. AAP occurred after a median of two doses, and 9 d (median) from the latest administration of PEG-asparaginase. The major manifestations of AAP was abdominal pain (11/13) . At the time of AAP diagnosis during the first 48 hours the median peak serum amylase and serum lipase levels were 559 U/L (range 118-1 585, upper normal limit: 125) and 934 U/L (range 221-1 673, upper normal limit: 300). Three cases with serum amylase and serum lipase levels above 3 times upper normal limit were repeatedly complicated with pancreatic pseudocyst 11 patients had abnormal CT imaging, 8 cases revealed effusion around the pancreas, and 4 cases had pseudocyst. Therapy with ulinastatin, octreotide acetate, glucocorticoid could relieve abdominal pain significantly. Three cases underwent abdominal puncture drainage and 5 cases fulfilled nasojejunal nutrition therapy. Nine of them were cured, 4 developed pseudocyst, in 2 AAP vanished gradually and 2 died with pseudocyst.The major manifestations of AAP were abdominal pain, but sometimes apparent and sometimes latent. Condition of acute pancreatitis may exacerbate rapidly and easily. Early identification had significance. Pancreatic pseudocyst suggested a poor prognosis.
