Passive-bending, short-type single-balloon enteroscope for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in Roux-en-Y anastomosis patients. To evaluate short-type-single-balloon enteroscope (SBE) with passive-bending, high-force transmission functions for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in patients with Roux-en-Y anastomosis.Short-type SBE with this technology (SIF-Y0004-V01 working length, 1520 mmThe rate of reaching the blind end was 90% with SIF-Y0004-V01 and 91% with SIF-Y0004 (P = 0.59). The median time required to reach the papilla was significantly shorter with SIF-Y0004-V01 than with SIF-Y0004 (16 min vs 24 min, P = 0.04). The diagnostic success rate was 93% with SIF-Y0004-V01 and 84% with SIF-Y0004 (P = 0.17). The therapeutic success rate was 95% with SIF-Y0004-V01 and 96% with SIF-Y0004 (P = 0.68). The median procedure time was 40 min with SIF-Y0004-V01 and 36 min with SIF-Y0004 (P = 0.50). The incidence of hyperamylasemia was 6.0% in the SIF-Y0004-V01 group and 14.7% in the SIF-Y0004 group (P = 0.723). The incidence of pancreatitis was 0% in the SIF-Y0004-V01 group and 5.9% in the SIF-Y0004 group (P > 0.999). The incidence of gastrointestinal perforation was 2.0% (1/50) in the SIF-Y0004-V01 group and 2.9% (1/34) in the SIF-Y0004 group (P > 0.999).SIF-Y0004-V01 is useful for ERCP in patients with Roux-en-Y anastomosis and may reduce the time required to reach the blind end.
