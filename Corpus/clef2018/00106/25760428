Protective effects of polyenoylphosphatidylcholine in rats with severe acute pancreatitis. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect of polyenoylphosphatidylcholine (PPC) in rats with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) and its mechanism.Seventy-two clean, conventional Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 groups (SAP sham operation [SO], SAP + PPC, and SO + PPCThe SAP + PPC group had significantly improved pathologic pancreas increased in pancreatic acinar cell membrane fluidity, pancreatic tissue Ca-Mg-ATPase activity, and superoxide dismutasePolyenoylphosphatidylcholine could reduce the damage to the pancreas through increasing pancreatic acinar cell membrane fluidity and pancreatic tissue calcium pump activity. Polyenoylphosphatidylcholine also scavenges oxygen free radicals and reduces lipid peroxide levels.
