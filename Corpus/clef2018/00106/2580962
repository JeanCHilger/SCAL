Serial alterations in the forms of immunoreactive pancreatic cationic trypsin in plasma from patients with acute pancreatitis. We employed a radioimmunoassay for human cationic trypsin to define the time course for alterations in the molecular forms of this enzyme in plasma from patients with pancreatitis. Six patients developed acute pancreatitis as a complication of a known disorder [three, Reye's syndrome two, hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)
