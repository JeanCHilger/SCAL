Sedum sarmentosun bunge extraction ameliorated severe acute pancreatitis-induced lung injury: an experimental research]. To explore the effect of Sedum sarmentosum Bunge Extract (SSBE) on severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) induced acute lung injury (ALI) model rats and their excessive inflammatory reactions.Forty-two healthy adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into 3 groups, the sham-operated control group (C), the SAP group (SAP), and the SSBE treated group (SSBE), 14 in each group. SAP induced ALl rat model was induced by retrograde injection of 5% sodium taurocholate (1 mL/kg) into the pancreatic duct. SSBE (100 m/kg) was administrated subcutaneously after the establishment of the SAP model. Equal dose of SSBE was injected again 12 h later. Equal volume of normal saline was administrated in the same way for rats in the C group and the SAP group. Rats were sacrificed after successful modeling and samples taken at 12 and 24 h. Pathological changes in the pancreas and the lung tissue were observed under light microscope. The ascites, serum amylase (AMS), wet/dry proportion (W/D) of the lung tissue, activities of myeloperoxidase (MPO), interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were also measured.Ascites and serum AMS activities significantly increased MPO, IL-1, IL-6, TNF-alpha contents, and W/D ratio also significantly increased in the SAP group, when compared with the C group (P<0.05). Compared with the SAP group, those parameters were all attenuated in the SSBE group at 12 and 24 h (P<0.05, P<0.01). Pathological changes in the pancreas and the lung tissue were alleviated in the SSBE group under light microscope. The injury degree ranged between that of the C group and the SAP group.SSBE could relieve the ALl in SAP model rats, which could be achieved through alleviating inflammation responses of SAP rats.
