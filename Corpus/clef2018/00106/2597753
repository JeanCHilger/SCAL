Effects of several regulatory peptides on the functional activity of the pancreas in acute experimental pancreatitis. The influence of regulatory peptides (somatostatin, calcitonin, and dalargin) on xanthine oxidase activity and lipid peroxidation level in pancreatic tissues as well as on the release of pancreatic enzymes (alpha-amylase, trypsin, lipase, and transamidinase) into blood was studied in 205 rats with experimental acute pancreatitis. Somatostatin and dalargin were shown to have obvious antioxidant effect seen by reduced xanthine oxidase activity and MDA level. All studied peptides stimulate reduced release of pancreatic enzymes. Particularly, reduction of dalargin and somatostatin is caused by inhibition of their synthesis as well as by pancreas protective effect of the peptides. Release of enzymes reduced by calcitonin is probably associated only with inhibition of secretory activity of the pancreas.
