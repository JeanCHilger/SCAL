Lipids generated during acute pancreatitis increase inflammatory status of macrophages by interfering with their M2 polarization. Necrosis of adipose tissue is a common complication of acute pancreatitis. The areas of steatonecrosis become a source of inflammatory mediators, including chemically modified fatty acids which could influence the progression of the systemic inflammation. In an experimental model of acute pancreatitis we analyzed the effects of lipids generated by two representative areas of adipose tissue on the switch to the M1 phenotype in macrophages.Pancreatitis was induced in rats by intraductal administration of 5% taurocholate and after 6 h, lipids from retroperitoneal, mesenteric or epididymal adipose tissues were collected. Lipid uptake, phenotype polarization and the activation of PPARγ and NFκB were evaluated in macrophages treated with these lipids.After induction of pancreatitis, lipids from visceral adipose tissue promote the switch to an increased pro-inflammatory phenotype in macrophages. This effect is not related with a higher activation of NFκB but with an interfering effect on the activation of M2 phenotype.During acute pancreatitis, lipids generated by some areas of adipose tissue interfere on the M2 polarization of macrophages, thus resulting in a more intense pro-inflammatory M1 response.
