Clinical Efficacy of L-Asparaginasum Combined with CHOP for Treating Patients with Extranodal Natural Killer/T Cell Lymphoma. To investigate the clinical efficacy of L-asparginasum, ASP) combined with CHOP for treating patients with extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma.A total of 68 patients with extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma in our hospital from August 2007 to May 2009 were enrolled in this study, out of them 34 patients received CHOP regimen (CHOP group) and other 34 patients received CHOP regimen combined with L-Asparaginasum (ASP+CHOP group). The clinical efficacy of both groups was analyzed and compared after treatment.In CHOP group 16 patients achieved CR+PR, the total remission rate (TRR) was 47.06% in ASP+CHOP group 24 patients achieved CR+PR, the TRR was 70.58%, and the TRR in ASP+CHOP group was higher than that in CHOP group, there was statistical significance between these 2 groups (X(2) = 3.886, P < 0.05). The time of PFS in CHOP group was 24.7 months, and the time of PFS in ASP+CHOP group was 47.5 months which was significantly longer than that in CHOP group, and there was statistical siguificance between these 2 groups (P < 0.05). The incidence of anemia with grade I-II and III-IV blood cell reduction in ASP+CHOP group was higher than that in CHOP group (P < 0.05). The incidence of fever with grade I-II and albumin decrease in ASP+CHOP group was higher than that in CHOP group (P < 0.05). The abnormality of coagulation function in ASP+CHOP group was higher than that in CHOP group (P < 0.05). The anaphylactic reaction was found in 6 cases. The increase of serum amylase was observed in 1 case of aggressive NK/T cell lymphoma, the acute pancreatitis occured in 1 case who was inproved after treatment, but this patients died due to rapid progression of disease caused by poor general condition and untolerance to chemotherapy. The incomplete intestinal obstruction was found in 3 patients who recovered after conservative treatment. The grade II serum creatinine was elevated in 2 cases of ASP+CHOP group and in 1 case of CHOP group who was inproved after symptomatic therapy.L-Asparaginasum combined with CHOP for treating patients with extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma is effective, and may be used in clinic.
