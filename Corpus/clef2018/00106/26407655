Loganin protects against pancreatitis by inhibiting NF-κB activation. Acute pancreatitis (AP) is an inflammatory disease of the pancreas, which, in its most severe form, is associated with multi-organ failure and death. Loganin, a major iridoid glycoside obtained from Corni fructus, has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and anti-shock effects. However, the effects of loganin on AP have not been determined. Pre-treatment of loganin reduced pancreatic damage and AP-associated lung injury and attenuated the severity of AP, as evidenced by (1) a reduction in several biochemical parameters (pancreatic weight to body weight ratio, myeloperoxidase activity, and level of amylase) and (2) production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. However, post-treatment of loganin failed to improve pancreatic damage and biochemical parameters of AP, but could inhibit the AP-induced elevation of IL-1β and TNF-α significantly. In addition, cerulein-induced activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB was inhibited in the pancreas by administration of loganin. In conclusion, these results suggest that loganin exhibits an anti-inflammatory effect in cases of AP and its pulmonary complications through inhibition of NF-κB activation.
