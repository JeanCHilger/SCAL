Biological disturbances during the lupus-associated pancreatitis: case report. We report in this paper the case of female patient, hypertriglyceridemia associated with milky serum and hyperglycemia have been the alarm signal of a lupus-associated pancreatitis, the confirmation of this entity was done with elevated rate of serum lipase activity. It is about a 33 years age female. She has as unique antecedent a lupus diagnosed on January of the same. The patient was admitted on august 2013 for another episode of lupus associated to the lower lamb edema with a rate of C3 at 0.4 g/L (0.82-1,93) and C4 at 0.05 g/L (0.15-0.57). One day after the beginning of the corticotherapy, the patient presented hyperthermia, ataxis and behavior troubles, epigastric and articular pains and vomiting. Biochemical tests found hyperglycemia at 38.9 mmol/L (3.9-6.1), dyslipidemia with hypertriglyceridemia at 15.7 mmol/L (0.3-1.7) and total cholesterol rate at 5.2 mmol/L (<5.2) associated with milky serum. Haematological tests objective normocytic normochromic anemia with 81 g/L of hemoglobin, lymphopenia at 0.88 G/L and normal platelet rate. Lupus associated pancreatitis was suggested and confirmed biologically with an hyperlipasemia at 180 UI/L (8-78) and radiologicaly with the image of focal hepatic steatosis. We conclude that on the presence of lupus, gastrointestinal and/or biological signs must motivate the measurement of the serum lipase activity as quickly as possible to assess the diagnosis of lupus-associated pancreatitis.
