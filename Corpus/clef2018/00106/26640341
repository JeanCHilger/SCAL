Single center experience in selecting the laparoscopic Frey procedure for chronic pancreatitis. To share our experience regarding the laparoscopic Frey procedure for chronic pancreatitis (CP) and patient selection.All consecutive patients undergoing duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection from July 2013 to July 2014 were reviewed and those undergoing the Frey procedure for CP were included in this study. Data on age, gender, body mass index (BMI), American Society of Anesthesiologists score, imaging findings, inflammatory index (white blood cells, interleukin (IL)-6, and C-reaction protein), visual analogue score score during hospitalization and outpatient visit, history of CP, operative time, estimated blood loss, and postoperative data (postoperative mortality and morbidity, postoperative length of hospital stay) were obtained for patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery. The open surgery cases in this study were analyzed for risk factors related to extensive bleeding, which was the major reason for conversion during the laparoscopic procedure. Age, gender, etiology, imaging findings, amylase level, complications due to pancreatitis, functional insufficiency, and history of CP were assessed in these patients.Nine laparoscopic and 37 open Frey procedures were analyzed. Of the 46 patients, 39 were male (85%) and seven were female (16%). The etiology of CP was alcohol in 32 patients (70%) and idiopathic in 14 patients (30%). Stones were found in 38 patients (83%). An inflammatory mass was found in five patients (11%). The time from diagnosis of CP to the Frey procedure was 39 ± 19 (9-85) mo. The BMI of patients in the laparoscopic group was 20.4 ± 1.7 (17.8-22.4) kg/m(2) and was 20.6 ± 2.9 (15.4-27.7) kg/m(2) in the open group. All patients required analgesic medication for abdominal pain. Frequent acute pancreatitis or severe abdominal pain due to acute exacerbation occurred in 20 patients (43%). Pre-operative complications due to pancreatitis were observed in 18 patients (39%). Pancreatic functional insufficiency was observed in 14 patients (30%). Two laparoscopic patients (2/9) were converted. In seven successful laparoscopic cases, the mean operative time was 323 ± 29 (290-370) min. Estimated intra-operative blood loss was 57 ± 14 (40-80) mL. One patient had a postoperative complication, and no mortality was observed. Postoperative hospital stay was 7 ± 2 (5-11) d. Multiple linear regression analysis of 37 open Frey procedures showed that an inflammatory mass (P < 0.001) and acute exacerbation (P < 0.001) were risk factors for intra-operative blood loss.The laparoscopic Frey procedure for CP is feasible but only suitable in carefully selected patients.
