Experimental pancreatic duct occlusion with polyurethane. Pancreatic transplantation requires an effective method to manage exocrine secretion. A new technique to eliminate the exocrine function of the pancreas by obstruction of the duct with polyurethane was investigated in terms of function, outcome and morphology. Polyurethane is an alcoholic solution of block copolymers with the property of polymerizing within 5-10 min. In this study the in-situ pancreatic tail model in dogs was utilized, the pancreatic duct was cannulated and injected with 2-3 ml of polyurethane. As a result, complete atrophy and fibrosclerosis of the exocrine tissue was obtained leaving islets well vascularized and functioning for the entire experimental periods. All animals remained normoglycemic and showed normal K-values. Amylase levels were found to be maximally elevated at 24 h and returned to normal within 2 weeks after duct occlusion. Insulin, glucagon and somatostatin levels remained normal. Because of its ability to effect a complete occlusion of the pancreatic ducts with subsequent atrophy of the exocrine gland and without notable disturbance of endocrine function, we feel that polyurethane solution is superior to previously used materials for this purpose.
