Risk Factors Of Pancreatitis After Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography--A Retrospective Cohort Study. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the most important non-surgical procedure in serious pancreatic and biliary diseases, still burdened with the risk of severe complications. The objective of the study was to distinguish factors which could increase the risk of occurrence of ERCP complication in the form of pancreatitis.The study included 452 patients who had undergone ERCP. Patients' records were retrospectively analyzed from the aspect of demographic data, indications for the procedure, type and course of the procedure, type and severity of complications, width of the common bile duct (CBD), concomitant diseases and administered medicines which might increase the risk of complications.In 35 patients (7.7%) a complication occurred in the form of pancreatitis (AP). A severe course was confirmed in 11 patients (31%). Cholelithiasis constituted approximately 2/3 of indications for ERCP. AP after ERCP was significantly more often observed in the group of patients aged under 40 (22.9% vs 8.6% p<0.05). Narrow biliary ducts (3-8 mm) were the factor increasing the frequency of development of AP (25.9% vs 45%ERCP is a very valuable procedure in clinical treatment however, it is burdened with the risk of complications, such as AP, bleeding, or duodenal perforation. A group especially exposed to the risk of complications in the form of AP are young patients aged under 40 with a narrow CBD.
