Acute obstructive suppurative pancreatic ductitis after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in a patient with carcinoma of the pancreatic head:a case report. An 85-year-old woman with jaundice was referred to our hospital where she was diagnosed with obstructive jaundice due to carcinoma of the pancreatic head based on blood tests and abdominal computed tomography (CT). We performed endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for biliary drainage, but 5 days after the procedure, she complained of epigastric pain. Laboratory data revealed an elevated white blood cell count and a high serum amylase concentration. Follow-up CT 6 days after the ERCP revealed that the main pancreatic duct diameter had increased since the time of admission. Therefore, ERCP was performed for pancreatic ductal drainage. Purulent pancreatic juice was drained by endoscopic placement of a nasopancreatic drainage tube in the main pancreatic duct, resulting in marked alleviation of clinical symptomshowever, after removal of the tube, the abdominal pain recurred. Subsequent endoscopic placement of a pancreatic stent improved her clinical status once again. Herein, we report this rare case of acute obstructive suppurative pancreatic ductitis in a patient with carcinoma of the pancreatic head.
