Hyperlipoproteinemia associated acute pancreatitis complicating with pregnancy--a case report. Hyperlipoproteinemia associated with acute pancreatitis is a rare complication during pregnancy. Acute pancreatitis may occur when physiologic hyperlipoproteinemia of pregnancy superimposes on primary or secondary hyperlipoproteinemia. In the meantime, acute pancreatitis may unmask hyperlipoproteinemia and the pattern of lipoprotein electrophoresis may evolve from Fredrickson type III to type IV or type V during acute pancreatitis. We reported a case and reviewed the literature. A 28 years old woman, G4P3, was admitted to our hospital in the sixth month of pregnancy because of epigastralgia and vomiting for 10 days and respiratory distress for one day. Laboratory examination revealed amylase 551 U/L, lipase 1073 U/L, blood sugar 873 g/dl, triglyceride 1298 mg/dl and cholesterol 1044 mg/dl. Abdominal sonogram revealed diffuse edematous change of the pancreas and minimal ascites. The symptoms and signs subsided gradually after supportive treatment that included nothing per os, fluid and electrolyte balance, antacid and analgesics. Unfortunately , intrauterine fetal death was found on the twentieth day after admission. The blood levels of triglyceride and sugar were still elevated 3 weeks after discharge. The most important observation was a broad beta lipoprotein band found in lipoprotein electrophoresis in the acute stage of this case. The broad beta band disappeared and Fredrickson type IV was found in the late stage of pancreatitis. The pattern of lipoprotein electrophoresis changed to Fredrickson type V 3 weeks later.
