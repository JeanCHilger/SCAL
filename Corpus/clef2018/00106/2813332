Failure of a potent cholecystokinin antagonist to protect against diet-induced pancreatitis in mice. The effects of a potent cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonist, L-364,718, on two forms of experimental acute pancreatitis in mice were evaluated. The antagonist prevented the hyperamylasemia, pancreatic edema, and acinar cell vacuolization that followed administration of a supramaximally stimulating dose of the cholecystokinin analogue cerulein. In contrast, the same dose of L-364,718 (1 mg/kg/6 h) and an even higher dose (10 mg/kg/6 h) failed to prevent the hyperamylasemia, acinar cell necrosis, and mortality that followed administration of a choline-deficient ethionine-supplemented diet. These observations are at variance with those previously reported to follow administration of the relatively weak cholecystokinin antagonist proglumide (Niederau C et al. J Clin Invest 198678:1056-63). The observations reported in this communication suggest that cholecystokinin does not play an important role in diet-induced pancreatitis and that CCK receptor antagonists are unlikely to be of benefit in the treatment of clinical acute pancreatitis.
