Acute pancreatitis: a complication of Foley catheter gastrostomy. Acute pancreatitis can be caused by inadvertent migration into the duodenum of the inflated balloon of a Foley gastrostomy catheter. The clinical picture is that of an acute abdomen. The diagnosis is made with a high index of suspicion and confirmed by marked elevation of serum and urine amylase levels. The treatment consists of repositioning of the gastrostomy tube and supportive therapy. Careful external fixation of the tube to the abdominal wall can prevent this complication.
