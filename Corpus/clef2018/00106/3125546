Controlled trial of protease inhibitor gabexelate mesilate (FOY) in the treatment of acute pancreatitis. A controlled trial with synthetic protease inhibitor gabexelate mesilate (FOY) in the treatment of acute pancreatitis was conducted in a total of 42 patients. The age, sex, etiology of pancreatitis, initial serum amylase level, and amylase creatinine clearance ratio were comparable between FOY-treated and control groups. FOY did not alter the course of the disease, but there was a weak trend toward lower morbidity and mortality in the FOY-treated patients. These results may justify further, larger scale studies or evaluation of alternate dosage or route of administration.
