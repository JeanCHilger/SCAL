Contribution of pancreatic edema and short-term ischemia to experimental acute pancreatitis in the rat. II. Behaviour of serum parameters. The biochemical characterization of experimental acute pancreatitis was performed by determination of the secretory enzymes lipase and alpha-amylase, of the cytoplasmic ALAT (alanine aminotransferase), of total protein and calcium concentration in serum of rats. The moderate and protracted course of the pathological process in the small animal model presented allowed to study the initial phase from 1-24 h. In the first 4-8 h most massive enzyme release into the intravasal space was observed. The level of enzyme activities was correlating with the severity of assault. One noxa alone (ischemia or juice edema) resulted in a moderate enzyme release (lipase : 2-2.5 fold of control). The action of both noxae caused a drastical increase in enzyme activities in the initial phase lipase : 8-20 fold, ALAT: 7 fold, alpha-Amylase: 2.5 fold). 24 h postoperatively the serum enzyme activities were at distinct pathological level. At this time acute pancreatitis provoked already a decreased serum protein content. A hypocalcemia was not observed.
