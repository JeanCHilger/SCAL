Cerulein induces hyperplasia of the pancreas in a rat model of chronic pancreatic insufficiency. Chronic pancreatic insufficiency (CPI) was induced in male Wistar rats by the injection of a zein-oleic acid-linoleic acid solution into their pancreaticobiliary ducts. Animals injected developed severe pancreatic atrophy with fibrosis and greater than 90% loss of pancreatic enzyme content. The animals also developed malabsorption of fat and bentiromide. Three weeks after the CPI lesion was induced, animals were randomized to receive cerulein 2 micrograms/kg twice daily subcutaneously or saline twice daily subcutaneously for 2 weeks. Cerulein significantly increased pancreatic trypsinogen (p less than 0.03), amylase (p less than 0.01), lipase (p less than 0.02), DNA (p less than 0.02), and RNA (p less than 0.01) content and improved fat and bentiromide malabsorption as compared to saline (p less than 0.05). We conclude that cerulein therapy can cause significant hyperplasia of pancreatic acinar parenchyma in an animal model of CPI and that this therapy can partially reverse malabsorption.
