Survival after profound hypocalcaemia with tetany complicating severe haemorrhagic acute pancreatitis. A patient is reported who developed severe haemorrhagic pancreatitis, without hyperamylasemia, which was complicated by gross hypocalcaemia presenting as tetany. Tetany is very uncommon in acute pancreatitis and is a grave prognostic indicator, recovery being exceptionally rare. The mechanisms responsible for disordered calcium homeostasis associated with acute pancreatitis are reviewed. CT scanning was an important feature of this patient's management and its role in severe pancreatitis is discussed.
