Study of pancreatic tissue pH in the early stage of experimental acute pancreatitis. Pancreatic pH was measured electrometrically over a period of 3 h in 34 dogs with acute necrotic pancreatis. The disease had been induced with sunflower oil in 10, with Na-taurocholate in 10 and with hen's egg yolk in 10 animals. Four dogs served as controls. The pH of the pancreatic tissue changed differently in the different groups, in accordance with the different pathomechanisms. Injection of sunflower oil was followed by a protracted acidosis of pancreatic tissue, that of taurocholate by a transitory moderate decline of pH. Egg-yolk produced an evanescent, slight fall in pancreatic pH, followed by complete normalization within a few minutes. The differences between the initial and the 3-h values attain the level of significance only in case of sunflower-oil pancreatitis.
