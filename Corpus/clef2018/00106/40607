The two human trypsinogens. Evidence of complex formation with basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor-proteolytic activity. The formation of complexes between human trypsinogens and the basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor is demonstrated by using affinity chromatography on Sepharose coupled to basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor. This interaction indicates the pre-existence of the active site in human trypsinogens. This active site induces the proteolytic activity of the two zymogens which activate spontaneously at pH 5.6 and pH 8.0 before and after affinity chromatography. The effect of affinity-chromatography on trypsinogen spontaneous activation is not the same on trypsinogens 1 and 2. A striking difference appears between the activation of the two trypsinogens. In all cases, trypsinogen 1 autoactivates more rapidly than trypsinogen 2, except at pH 5.6 in the presence of 10 mM Ca2+, which inhibits the autoactivation of trypsinogen 1. The effect of inherent proteolytic activity of human trypsinogens is discussed in relation to pathological conditions of enterokinase deficiency and acute pancreatitis.
