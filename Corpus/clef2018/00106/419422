Evaluation of atropine in acute pancreatitis. A prospective randomized clinical trial was carried out to evaluate the efficacy of atropine in the treatment of acute pancreatitis. Fifty-one patients with elevated amylase levels, and with the clinical signs and symptoms of acute pancreatitis, were included in the study. All were treated with fluids intravenously and analgesics, and a nasogastric tube if needed. In addition, on a random basis, 19 were given atropine intramuscularly and 32 were not. The clinical courses of the two groups of patients did not differ significantly.
