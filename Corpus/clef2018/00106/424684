Influence of anticholinergic treatment on rat pancreatic protein and amylase concentrations. Pancreatic protein and amylase concentrations were measured after subcutaneous administration of an anticholinergic drug (Pro-Banthine to rats in different doses. In doses comparable to those given in acute pancreatitis an increase of both pancreatic protein and amylase concentrations was found. If pancreatitis is indeed caused or maintained by proteases released from the acinar cell, anticholinergics--giving rise to an accumulation of enzymes within the pancreas--may do more harm than good in the treatment of acute pancreatitis.
