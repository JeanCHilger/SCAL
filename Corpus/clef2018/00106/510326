Phospholipase A2 in serum and ascitic exudate in experimental acute haemorrhagic pancreatitis in pigs. We have developed a model of experimental haemorrhagic pancreatitis in pigs with a 100% mortality within 24 h without treatment. In this model we have studied the production of peritioneal exudate and compared the concentrations of amylase, lipase and phospholipase A2 in the ascitic exudate and serum. The results suggest that the determination of phospholipase A2 might be important in the diagnosis and follow-up of acute pancreatitis.
