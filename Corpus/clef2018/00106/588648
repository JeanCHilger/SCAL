Hepatic and pancreatic dysfunction in anorexia nervosa: a report of two cases. Two patients with anorexia nervosa with evidence of pancreas and liver injury are reported. Both showed evidence of organ dysfunction in the presence of cachexia. Serum amylase, ASAT (GOT), and ALAT (GPT) became normal parallel with body weight. On the basis of reports on the effects of malnutrition on pancreas and liver function, it is suggested that nutritional pancreas and liver dysfunction might represent hitherto unrecognized complications of anorexia nervosa.
