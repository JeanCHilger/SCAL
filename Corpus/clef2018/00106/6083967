Proteinases and inhibitors in plasma and peritoneal exudate in acute pancreatitis. Examination of the peritoneal exudates of 12 patients with acute pancreatitis revealed high activities of pancreatic lipase and amylase. The immunologic levels of the plasma-derived inhibitors alpha 1-antitrypsin, antithrombin III and alpha 2-macroglobulin in the peritoneal exudates were not markedly different from those of the plasma. However, the inhibitory capacity of alpha 2-macroglobulin, the main inhibitor of human pancreatic trypsin in the exudate, was almost completely depleted when measured by an enzymatic method. Furthermore, spontaneous fibrinolysis occurred in 6 out of 13 exudates applied to plasminogen-free fibrin plates, indicating the presence of free proteinase. This fibrinolytic activity might be inhibited by exogenous alpha 2-macroglobulin or aprotinin (Trasylol, Bayer AG).
