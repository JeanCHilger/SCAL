Reovirus type 3 infection in a suckling mouse: the effects on pancreatic structure and enzyme content. Alterations in pancreatic function and structure were examined in suckling mice infected intraperitoneally with reovirus type 3. The results were compared to pancreatic zymogen enzyme activities and histology in adult mice infected with the same virus. No effect of the rovirus type 3 on the adult mice could be elicited. In contrast, the suckling mice infected by the reovirus type 3 revealed a definite change in pancreatic zymogen enzymes. However, the zymogen enzymes were affected in a nonparallel fashion and three groups of enzymes with different responses were noted. Amylase and lipase activities were significantly diminished (P less than 0.001) at 6 days of viral infection. The endopeptidases, trypsin (P less than 0.025) and cymotrypsin (P less than 0.001) activities were increased significantly in the infected group. The exopeptidases, carboxypeptidase A and B in the infected animals were not changed significantly compared to the control. It seems reasonable that the reovirus type 3 infection in the suckling mouse causes diminished lipase and amylase activities that might contribute to the pathogenesis of viral enteritis.
