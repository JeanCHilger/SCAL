Hyperamylasemia, duodenal duplication, and pleural effusions in hereditary spherocytosis. A 15-year-old girl with hereditary spherocytosis was admitted for evaluation of recurrent pleural effusions containing amylase in high concentration and was found to have biliary obstruction, pancreatitis, and a congenital duplication of the duodenum attached to an accessory lobe of the pancreas via the duct of Santorini, a unique entity. Successful surgical management of these disorders included common duct clearance and anastomosis of the duplication to the adjacent duodenum.
