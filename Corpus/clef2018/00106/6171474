Changes of amylase during experimental pancreatic carcinogenesis in hamsters. Changes of amylase activity and isozymic pattern in the serum, urine, ascites, pancreas and parotid gland of hamsters during pancreatic carcinogenesis induced by N-nitrosobis (2-oxopropyl) amine (BOP) were examined. During the early stage of pancreatic carcinogenesis, amylase activity in the urine was greatly increased and the pancreatic type of isozyme increased in the serum and urine, but in the terminal stage, the activity decreased and the isozymic pattern reverted to normal. These alterations of amylase could be due to focal pancreatitis around dysplastic ductules and small carcinoma lesions causing leakage of pancreatic juice. This phenomenon may be of value in diagnosis of the early stage of pancreatic cancer.
