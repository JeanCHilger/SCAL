Acute pancreatitis in systemic lupus erythematosus: report of twenty cases and a review of the literature. A retrospective study was undertaken of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus in whom serum amylase had been determined. Sixty-three patients were identified, and of these 53 had abdominal pain at the time of the amylase measurement. Twenty-seven (51 percent) had a normal serum amylase, and 12 of this group had defined reasons for the abdominal pain. Of the 26 patients with hyperamylasemia, 6 had extrapancreatic causes for the elevated amylase. In 20 patients (37 percent of those with abdominal pain) the clinical diagnosis of pancreatitis was made. The amylase levels showed no correlation with renal function nor with dose of corticosteroid. Four patients with pancreatitis were identified in whom no contributing factor other than SLE could be ascertained. No serious complication of the pancreatitis was seen, and recovery occurred despite continued steroid therapy. Pancreatitis is not a rare occurrence in SLE, and may be related in part to the vasculitis seen during periods of disease activity.
