Acute pancreatitis in identical twins. Identical twins, 34-years-old at the time, developed abdominal pain of similar character while at a holiday resort. Both had drunk a greater amount of alcohol than usual, approximately eight 200-mL glasses of beer. The symptoms in one twin forced him to present to hospital where his plasma amylase level was found to be 2300 u/L. The other had the same symptoms, but did not present to hospital however, when the symptoms later recurred, he also was found to have pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis occurring simultaneously in identical twins has been reported only on one previous occasion.
