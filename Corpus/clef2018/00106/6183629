Acute pancreatitis in pregnancy: two case reports. Two cases of acute pancreatitis in pregnancy with apparently different etiology are reported and the literature is reviewed. In 1 case, continued fetal growth during a period of hyperalimentation is shown. Although acute pancreatitis is a rare complication of pregnancy, there is evidence that both maternal mortality and fetal loss should be low. The main risk to the fetus is from the effects of premature birth. Experimental evidence suggests that pregnancy may be an etiologic factor, but the condition is probably not more common in pregnancy. Although termination of pregnancy may cause prompt regression of symptoms, it should not normally be necessary. Indications for surgical intervention are not affected by the pregnancy, nor are indications for mode of delivery affected by the pancreatitis.
