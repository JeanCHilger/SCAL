Concomitant pancreatitis in hepatic coma. Increased levels of serum amylase were found in 14 out of 34 patients (41%) with coma due to acute liver failure, in 8 out of 55 patients (14%) with hepatic encephalopathy, and in 5 out of 10 patients with a mixed pathogenesis. In 4 patients of the first group (11.7%) and 4 of the second group (7%) pancreatitis was diagnosed at post mortem. The pathogenesis of pancreatitis concomitant with liver failure is unclear. Virus infection and intoxication may do damage to both organs hemodynamic factors, coagulation defects, and derangements of metabolism may play a role as well.
