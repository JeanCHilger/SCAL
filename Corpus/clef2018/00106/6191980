Inhibition of human serum alpha-amylase activity. Amylase activity was measured in normal sera and serum of patients with acute pancreatitis and mumps. A significant decrease of enzyme activity in patients with acute pancreatitis was observed after incubation with specific antibody against hog pancreas amylase. A minimal effect of the antibody on normal serum and on that from mumps patients was noted. A comparable effect was observed in the presence of glyceraldehyde used as an amylase differentiating factor.
