Serum proteolytic and antiproteolytic activity in acute pancreatitis. This study has demonstrated an imbalance between the blood proteolytic and antiproteolytic system in acute pancreatitis. Serum elastase activity is markedly increased and elastase inhibitory capacity is decreased in this disease as compared with those in chronic pancreatitis and the control values. We have found that a return to normal values represents better evidence of resolution than amylase determinations. These results offer the clinician a biochemical guideline for the medical management of acute pancreatitis.
