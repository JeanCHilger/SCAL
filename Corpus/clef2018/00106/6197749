Bedside diagnosis of pancreatitis using the urinary amylase test tape. Preliminary results. A test strip for rapid detection of alpha-amylase in urine was evaluated in 12 patients with an acute episode of acute or chronic pancreatitis and in 16 patients with hyperamylasemia of varying origin. The test strip was positive in 11 of 12 patients with acute pancreatitis and in 8 of 13 patients with hyperamylasemia. In 3 patients with macroamylasemia the test strip was negative. The specificity was 98% in 100 ambulatory patients without evidence of pancreatic disease.
