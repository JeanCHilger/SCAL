Ct-morphology and exocrine function in chronic pancreatitis. A quantitative correlation between computer-tomographic (CT) findings and exocrine pancreatic function following secretin-ceruletide stimulation was performed in 48 patients with chronic pancreatitis thereby a significant correlation between the degree of morphological changes in CT and the stage of functional impairment was found (r = 0,7841, p less than 0,001). Bicarbonate secretion/h showed the strongest correlation to CT findings (r = -0,7193, p less than 0,001) within the single functional parameters. CT showed a limited sensitivity (50%) in detecting chronic pancreatitis in cases with a slight functional impairment (stage 1). Morphological signs as calcifications, pancreatic duct ectasia were constantly coupled with a severe degree of functional impairment, whereas enlargement and cysts were found throughout the different functional stages.
