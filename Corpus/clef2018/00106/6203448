Effects of protease inhibitors on coagulation abnormalities in acute canine pancreatitis. Coagulation abnormalities associated with severe pancreatitis were studied in 24 dogs. Group I consists of six control subjects who had duodenotomy alone. Group II consists of six dogs with pancreatitis induced by bile injection ( lcm3 /kg) into the pancreatic duct. The six dogs in Group III and the six in Group IV were given aprotinin (trasylol) 1.0 mg/kg and S-2441 (10mg/kg), a new synthetic protease inhibitor, respectively. These were given over 10 minutes by intravenous infusion, 20 minutes after bile induced pancreatitis. Blood was drawn for amylase, prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), fibrinogen, and platelets, in addition to markers for hypercoagulation, fibrinopeptide A, antithrombin III, and markers for fibrinolysis, B beta 15-42 immunoreactive peptides and alpha 2 antiplasmin at baseline, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours, 6 hours, and daily for 3 days after injection of bile or duodenotomy. There was no significant difference in PT, platelets, antithrombin III, and fibrinopeptide A among the four groups. Fibrinogen levels and PTT were minimally elevated in animals with bile induced pancreatitis, but these changes reached significance only at 24 hours and 48 hours, respectively (P less than 0.05). Immunoreactive B beta 15-42 became elevated at 30 minutes indicating fibrinolysis in animals with pancreatitis, and these changes were significant compared with Group I control subjects (P less than 0.05) throughout the study. Levels of alpha 2 antiplasmin were decreased in Group II animals with pancreatitis, which also suggests fibrinolysis. Amylase was elevated in Group II animals with pancreatitis (P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
