The effect of p-bromophenacylbromide, a phospholipase A inhibitor, in experimental acute pancreatitis in rats. In this study the effect of p-bromophenacylbromide (p-BPAB), an inhibitor of phospholipase A, was studied in acute pancreatitis in an experimental rat model. Acute pancreatitis was produced by instillation of 0.4 ml bile into the pancreatic duct. p-BPAB was injected i.p. in a dosage of 0.25 micrograms/g b.wt. 30 min before, 30 min after, or 4h after the onset of pancreatitis. Prophylactic and early administration of p-BPAB inhibited severe morphological changes, such as necrosis and hemorrhages. Moreover, during administration of the inhibitor, decreased plasma concentrations of serum lipase and amylase (P less than 0.001) were monitored and compared with untreated animals. These therapeutic effects of p-BPAB were not seen in rats in which the inhibitor was injected 4 h after the onset of pancreatitis. As a result the phospholipase inhibitor, p-BPAB, reduces the clinical and morphological manifestations of acute pancreatitis. The effect of p-BPAB is dependent on the time of administration.
