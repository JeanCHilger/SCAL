Relationship between insulin secretion and pancreas morphology in subjects with chronic pancreatitis. In order to investigate whether a relationship exists between in vivo insulin secretion and islet mass, 8 patients suffering from severe chronic relapsing pancreatitis were studied before and after pancreatectomy by glucose-glucagon-test (per os 1.75 g glucose i.v. glucagon 0.01 mg/kg b.w.) and by intravenous glucose-tolerance-test (iGTT) (i.v. glucose 0.33 g/kg b.w.). Postoperative in vitro assessments of pancreatic insulin and alpha-amylase content were performed, and morphometric studies were carried out. Patients were characterized by reduced c-peptide secretion when compared with healthy subjects. The c-peptide response to the glucose-glucagon-test correlated well with the morphometrically estimated exocrine and islet tissue mass (P less than 0.05) and with the content of insulin and amylase in the tissue. The findings suggest that in subjects suffering from severe chronic relapsing pancreatitis the maximal insulin response might represent a parameter for the patient's islet mass.
