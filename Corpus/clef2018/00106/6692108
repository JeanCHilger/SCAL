Pancreatic abscess: a review of seventeen cases. Seventeen patients out of a total of 190 cases of acute pancreatitis, over a period of 12 years, developed the rare but serious complication of pancreatic abscess. Presence of toxaemia, fever, tachycardia and a tender epigastric mass suggested the possibility of abscess formation. Significant hyperamylasaemia was present in 2 patients only. Barium enema examination showed colonic changes due to direct involvement in 3 patients. Pre-operative management included complete rest to the gastrointestinal tract, correction of fluid and electrolyte imbalance, monitoring of vital signs and other parameters and antibiotic cover with penicillin in combination with broad spectrum antibiotic. In recent years Metronidazole was added in 7 patients, and this resulted in significant improvement of results. Surgical drainage was performed in all cases. The postoperative course was stormy and a significant number of patients developed both local as well as systemic complications with multiorgan failure. Residual/recurrent abscess was seen in one case only. Ten patients died in the immediate postoperative period. The survival rate was 41 per cent.
