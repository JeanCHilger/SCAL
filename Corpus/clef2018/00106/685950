On the appearance, levels and regulation of pancreatic enzyme serum concentrations. The evaluation of serum pancreatic enzyme activity on whole and diluted serum permits the estimation of serum enzyme inhibitor activity via a ADS/AWS ratio. This has diagnostic value in chronic pancreatic disease. The serum pancreatic ferment activity appears to be regulated in part by serum steroid levels. It is responsive to high protein diet. A physiologic rationale is presented for the use of steroids and high protein diet in the treatment of acute and chronic pancreatic inflammation.
