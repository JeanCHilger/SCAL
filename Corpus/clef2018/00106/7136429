Clinical course and autopsy findings in acute and chronic pancreatitis. A retrospective study of 314 patients hospitalized for pancreatitis in the period 1972-1973, showed that 74 (24%) had died in the course of five years. The aim of the study was to elucidate the etiology and the course of the pancreatitis and the immediate cause of death in the 61 cases where an autopsy was performed. There were three types of histopathological findings at autopsy concerning the pancreas: acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis and one group with no or minimal changes in the pancreas. The last group had had typical clinical symptoms of pancreatitis with abdominal pain and elevated urine and/or serum amylase, in many patients a very marked rise. Alcoholism was the dominant predisposing factor, regardless of the type of histopathological findings, but when the first attack of pancreatitis appeared at advanced age, biliary tract disease and cancer were the dominant causes. Liver damage was a common finding in alcoholic pancreatitis.
