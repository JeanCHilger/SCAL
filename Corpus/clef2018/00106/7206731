Responses of exocrine pancreas to a six month oral treatment by methadone in rats (author's transl). Pancreatic secretion and pancreatic enzyme contents were studied in rats given orally methadone for six months (10 to 50 mg . kg-1 . day-1 in drinking water). The main results were as follows: 1. In conditions of acute pancreatic fistula under urethane anesthesia: (a) basal concentration of total protein increased in the juice (+23 p. 100, p less than 0,05). The increase in trypsinogen appeared larger than that of other enzymes (b) under conditions of maximal stimulation by 2 deoxy-glucose (2 DG), all secretory parameters were increased (protein x 2.7, p less than 0.05
