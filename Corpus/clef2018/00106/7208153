Gastric emptying and lingual lipase activity in cystic fibrosis. To identify gastric factors likely to contribute to fat maldigestion and malabsorption in cystic fibrosis (CF), gastric emptying time, secretion rate, and preduodenal lipolytic activity were studied. Gastric emptying of a liquid test meal and gastric acid secretion were determined in five CF teenagers with pancreatic insufficiency and in five healthy controls. During the first hr, the rate of gastric emptying exhibited a linear pattern in both CF patients and controls. Neither the emptying time nor the gastric secretion rate was different. Lingual lipase activity was measured in eight other CF patients with pancreatic insufficiency and in eight controls. Lipase activity was higher (P less than 0.05) in CF patients than in controls with values (mean +/- S.E.) of 34.48 +/- 11.59 and 12.65 +/- 5.60 mumole butyric acid min-1 ml-1, respectively. No correlation with age or body surface was observed. Intragastric lipolysis of a butterfat triglyceride test meal was fast in both groups, but more extensive (P less than 0.05) in CF patients than in controls. The data show that in CF with pancreatic insufficiency, gastric factors contributing to the first step of fat digestion are preserved. In fact, lingual lipase activity was found to be increased, and a more complete intragastric lipolysis was documented.
