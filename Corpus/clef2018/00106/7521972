Effect of serum glucose on the function of pancreatic exocrine in diabetic rats. In streptozotocin induced diabetic rats, the amylase content and amylase release from isolated pancreatic acini stimulated by CCK-8 were significantly decreased. Both decrease could be reversed when vanadate, a chemical which is capable of lowering blood glucose without effect on serum insulin level in diabetic rats, was given intragastrically. The in vitro analysis showed that high concentration of glucose could inhibit 3H-leucine incorporation in pancreatic acini and increase the MDA content in pancreatic acinar membrane. These results indicated that hyperglycemia might be one of the reasons which cause the dysfunction of pancreatic exocrine in diabetic rats.
