The effect of octreotide (SMS 201-995) on experimentally induced pancreatitis with 50% ethyl alcohol in rats. Brattle-Boro type rats with average weight of 200 gms were used for the experiment. We established 5 groups with 10 rats in each. Group I was the control group, Group II pancreatic trauma group and Group III rats were the pancreatitis group induced by 50% alcohol. Groups IV and V were the groups in which Octreotide was injected in different time intervals after induction of pancreatitis by 50% alcohol. Amylase values were statistically significant between the control group in which Octreotide was injected in different time intervals after induction of pancreatitis by 50% alcohol. The amylase values were statistically significant between the control group and the experiments (t2 = 4.69 p < 0.001, t3 = 8.06 p < 0.00001, t4 = 4.23 p < 0.002, t5 = 4.3 p < 0.002), and it was also significant between Group III and Groups II, IV, V (t2 = 9.62 p < 0.0001, t4 = 10.26 p < 0.0001, t5 = 3.69 p < 0.005), but it was not found significant between Groups II and IV, V (t4 = 0.52 p < 0.6, t5 = 1.69 p < 0.1). Histopathologic examination of the trauma group showed congestion, minimal lymphomonocyte infiltration. Patchy necrosis and shrinkage of the acinar cells with ductal dilatation were seen in the SMS 201-995 injection groups which were more pronounced in Group V. As a conclusion SMS 201-995 is not effective to prevent the ongoing pathology of pancreatitis but the increasing values of amylase were limited on the level of simply induced traumatic pancreatitis. It may be useful in the suppression of the enzymatic production during the course of pancreatitis.
