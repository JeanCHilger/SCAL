Effects of cyclosporine and tacrolimus (FK 506) on acute pancreatitis in mice. To use mice to examine the effects of cyclosporine and tacrolimus (FK 506) on two forms of acute pancreatitis often seen after clinical organ transplantation.In the first experiment, male CD-1 mice received cyclosporine (10 mg/kg), tacrolimus (0.32 mg/kg), or saline solution (control) subcutaneously once a day for 10 days. On the 11th day, acute edematous pancreatitis was induced by ceruletide (cerulein). In the second experiment, female ICR mice were fed with a choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented (CDE) diet for 72 hours to induce necrotizing pancreatitis. After 30 hours on the CDE diet, the mice received cyclosporine (10 mg/kg), tacrolimus (0.32 mg/kg), or saline solution (control) subcutaneously twice daily for 3 days.The pancreatic dry-to-wet weight ratios after ceruletide injections significantly decreased in mice treated with cyclosporine but did not with tacrolimus. Cyclosporine also significantly increased serum amylase levels, but tacrolimus did not. Cyclosporine or tacrolimus alone did not produce pancreatitis. In the CDE diet groups there was a significant difference in survival among the cyclosporine-treated, the tacrolimus-treated, and the control groups.Cyclosporine or tacrolimus given alone does not induce acute pancreatitis. In contrast, cyclosporine can adversely affect the course of acute edematous pancreatitis, and both immunosuppressants may worsen the survival of mice with acute hemorrhagic necrotizing pancreatitis. This study also demonstrated that the deteriorating effect of tacrolimus is less potent than that of cyclosporine.
