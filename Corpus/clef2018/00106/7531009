Recurrent acute pancreatitis induced by isoniazid. A 31-year-old man on haemodialysis who developed recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis during the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis is presented. The pancreatitis rapidly subsided once isoniazid was withdrawn, but the problem recurred again upon reintroduction of the drug. There was no further recurrence during successful treatment with full doses of rifampicin and pyrazinamide for 1 year.
