Loss of sensitivity to cholecystokinin stimulation of isolated pancreatic acini from genetically diabetic rats. Pancreatic exocrine function of a new inbred strain Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rat that develops spontaneous persistent hyperglycemia was evaluated in in vitro isolated pancreatic acini and compared with that in the control Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rat. Serum glucose and insulin concentrations in the OLETF rats were significantly high (glucose: 270 +/- 12 vs. 208 +/- 10 mg/100 ml, P < 0.01 insulin: 12.4 +/- 1.7 vs. 4.9 +/- 0.6 ng/ml, P) < 0.01), whereas pancreatic wet weight was significantly low (803 +/- 20 vs. 1,138 +/- 17 mg, P < 0.01) compared with those in the LETO rat. Pancreatic acini isolated from the OLETF rat were totally insensitive to cholecystokinin (CCK)-8 stimulation at concentrations of up to 100 nM. However, neither the responsiveness nor the sensitivity to carbamylcholine, bombesin, and secretin of the acini from the OLETF rat was altered or even increased, probably due to the larger amylase content in the OLETF rat acini compared with those of the LETO rat acini (31.5 +/- 2.0 vs. 13.0 +/- 1.1 Somogyi units/micrograms DNA, P < 0.01). The responsiveness to fluoride, a direct activator of guanine nucleotide-binding protein, in the OLETF rat acini was similar to that in the LETO rat, suggesting that the transmembrane signaling and effectors and subsequent intracellular signal transduction molecules in the OLETF rat acini are normal. Moreover, 125I-CCK binding to the acini prepared from the OLETF rat was totally absent. These present results indicate that the OLETF rat has a selective defect in the binding of CCK to its receptors on the acinar cell surface.
