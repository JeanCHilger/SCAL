Biliary amylase and congenital choledochal dilatation. The relationship between levels of biliary amylase measured at operation and clinical features was studied in a series of 55 children with congenital biliary dilatation (choledochal cyst) who presented between 1976 and 1993. There were 36 cystic and 19 fusiforms dilatations in the series. The most common modes of presentation were painless jaundice (n = 23) and pancreatitis (n = 22). Five infants presented with abnormal antenatal ultrasound examinations. Children with pancreatitis were older than those with painless jaundice (4.2 versus 1.5 years P = .005), and a higher proportion had raised levels of biliary amylase (100% versus 44%
