Nitric oxide modulates pancreatic basal secretion and response to cerulein in the rat: effects in acute pancreatitis. Nitric oxide synthase activity is detected in the pancreas, but the role of NO on pancreatic function has not been fully characterized. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of NO in normal and diseased pancreatic function.Amylase and NO secretion were measured in vivo in rats and in vitro in dispersed acini, with and without NO synthesis blockade, by NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). Rats were subjected to cerulein-induced pancreatitis, and the effects of L-NAME or NO donors were assessed.L-NAME reduced amylase output to 60% of basal. This effect was reversed by L-arginine. The secretory response to optimal doses of cerulein induced a poor amylase secretion and a marked release of NO. High doses of cerulein in combination with L-NAME inhibited NO formation and amylase secretion. In dispersed acini, supramaximal cerulein concentrations induced NO release, but the amylase dose-response curve was not modified by NO inhibition. In acute pancreatitis, L-NAME increased amylasemia and tissue myeloperoxidase activities, whereas NO donors reduced amylasemia, lipasemia, and the histological damage score.The L-arginine/NO pathway facilitates basal and stimulated pancreatic secretion in vivo. NO donor drugs may improve the course of acute pancreatitis.
