Acute pancreatitis following liver transplantation. Acute pancreatitis (AP) has not been recognized as a frequent complication following orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Reports have suggested that this condition is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates.A retrospective review of 354 patients who underwent OLT at the University of Toronto, with at least one-year follow-up, was done to identify the incidence, etiology, risk factors, and severity of pancreatitis following OLT, as well as to discuss its management. A possible correlation between AP and hepatitis B was also investigated. Prognostic score systems, including Ranson, Imrie, and APACHE II, were also evaluated.Acute pancreatitis occurred in 5.9 percent of the OLT recipients. Based on clinical presentation and diagnostic tests, AP could be subdivided into three distinct categories: biochemical AP, significant increase of serum amylase or lipase levels in absence of objective radiologic or surgical evidence of the disease clinical AP, pancreatitis with radiologic or surgical evidence of the diseaseAcute pancreatitis is not an uncommon complication of OLT. Clinical presentation and diagnostic tests have important prognostic values. In some patients, hepatitis B virus may play an important role. APACHE II scores appear to be useful in the evaluation of clinical AP following OLT. Treatment of AP should be similar in both the transplant and nontransplant setting.
