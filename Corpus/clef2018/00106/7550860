Effects of short-term administration of the CCK receptor antagonist, KSG-504, on regeneration of pancreatic acinar cells in acute pancreatitis in rats. Cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonists have been reported on have an inhibitory effect on acute experimental pancreatitis, but their long-term administration is also reported to block pancreatic regeneration. We examined whether the short-term administration of KSG-504 (KSG), a synthetic CCK-A receptor antagonist, inhibited the regeneration of pancreatic acinar cells after ethionine-induced acute pancreatitis in rats. KSG (50 mg/kg), given 12 times by subcutaneous injection at 6-h intervals, prevented the reduction of protein, amylase, and trypsinogen levels, and the DNA content of the pancreas and facilitated the recovery of these values. Ornithine decarboxylase activity in pancreatic tissue and a 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine labeling study indicated that DNA synthesis was accelerated in rats treated with KSG. These findings suggest that the short-term administration of KSG inhibits the development of ethionine-induced acute pancreatitis and facilitates the regeneration of acinar cells.
