The effect of chronic alcohol administration on cerulein-induced pancreatitis. Alcohol consumption i associated with pancreatitis, but the mechanism underlying this injury remains unclear. Alcohol consumption has recently been shown to increase the fragility of both rat pancreatic lysosomes and zymogen granules in vitro, which may predispose to autodigestion via the intracellular activation of digestive enzymes by lysosomal enzymes. Cerulein-induced pancreatitis is also associated with lysosomal fragility. To determine the effect of alcohol consumption on this form of pancreatic injury, the severity of pancreatitis was compared in three groups of rats following i.v. cerulein infusion: rats fed alcohol in a liquid diet, pair-fed dextrose controls, and chow-fed controls. The histological severity of pancreatitis induced by supramaximal cerulein infusion was not found to be increased by prior alcohol consumption. Since alcohol did not appear to increase the severity of pancreatic injury induced by cerulein, we sought to define biochemical parameters that might precede obvious injury. The subcellular distribution of cathepsin B activity and markers of lysosomal fragility were compared in the same groups of experimental animals. Cerulein infusion led to a marked redistribution of cathepsin B activity from the lysosomal to the zymogen-granule-enriched fractions.For animals killed in the fed state, a redistribution of cathepsin B activity toward the zymogen-granule-enriched fraction was also demonstrated in alcohol-fed animals compared to their pair-fed controls. However, chronic alcohol administration did not influence the effect of cerulein on subcellular cathepsin B distribution or lysosomal fragility. In this rat study, administration of alcohol did not increase the effects of supramaximal doses of cerulein on the pancreas.
