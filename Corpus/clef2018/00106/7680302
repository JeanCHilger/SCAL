Monitoring of serum proteinase--antiproteinase balance and systemic inflammatory response in prognostic evaluation of acute pancreatitis. Results of a prospective multicenter study. With the aim of studying the clinical usefulness and applicability of circulating levels of protease inhibitors, complement factors, acute phase reactants, and leukocytic enzymes in the prognostic evaluation of acute pancreatitis (AP), the present prospective multicenter study has been carried out. A total of 182 patients with AP have been included, to whom an exhaustive evolutive protocol has been applied from the time of their hospital admission (2-12 hr from the onset of the disease) until the 15th day of evolution in order to clearly define them. The severe episodes exhibit a greater consumption of alpha 2-macroglobulin, and C3 and C4 complement factors, as well as a greater increase of alpha 1-protease inhibitor, C-reactive protein and polymorphonuclear elastase than mild events, with regards to the underlying pathophysiological condition. The determination of the plasma levels of leukocytic elastase in the first hours of evolution allows a prediction of the severity of the acute pancreatitis event with a high reliability (predictive values that become higher than 90%). The clinical value of the remaining parameters analyzed, in this aspect, is less, being applicable to the monitoring of the disease.
