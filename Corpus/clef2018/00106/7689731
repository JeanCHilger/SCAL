Role of local pancreatic blood flow in development of hemorrhagic pancreatitis induced by stress in rats. Our previous data showed that the pancreatitis induced in rats by cerulein develops into hemorrhagic pancreatitis following water-immersion stress. The present study examined the effects of water-immersion stress and high doses of cerulein (intraperitoneal injection) on pancreatic blood flow. Five hours of water-immersion stress reduced the local pancreatic blood flow to approximately 30% of the initial value (253.75 +/- 12.58 ml/min/100 g) without causing any histological alterations. Blood flow was decreased as early as 1 h after the immersion and reached the lowest value (30% of initial value) 3 h after the immersion. The administration of 40 micrograms/kg body wt cerulein as two intraperitoneal injections reduced the pancreatic blood flow by 40% 5 h after the first cerulein injection. The injections of cerulein combined with water-immersion stress did not reduce the pancreatic blood flow more than did water-immersion stress alone. The systemic blood pressure was unaffected during 5 h of water immersion after the cerulein injections. These findings suggest that in rats the stress-induced decrease of local pancreatic blood flow may not produce pancreatitis, but may aggravate an existing acute pancreatitis.
