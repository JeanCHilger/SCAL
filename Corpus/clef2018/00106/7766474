Treatment of post-traumatic pancreatic pseudocyst by percutaneous Huisman's drainage. Pancreatic pseudocysts is a complication of acute posttraumatic pancreatitis. They usually cause recurrent abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and elevation of serum amylase levels. A history of epigastric blunt trauma, the before mentioned clinical signs and echographic or scanning studies may lead to a certain diagnosis. Although most of them resolve spontaneously, some persist and active therapeutic measures are required. Surgical internal drainage has been the operative technique of choice in children. Nevertheless, treatment can be achieved by percutaneous aspiration or drainage of pancreatic recurrent collections. We present our experience in two children with posttraumatic pancreatic pseudocyst, treated successfully by means of a percutaneous transabdominal pig-tail catheter (Huisman catheter). The technique of catheter placement and clinical aspects are discussed.
