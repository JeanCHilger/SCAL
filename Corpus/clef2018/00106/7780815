Cryosurgery of acute hemorrhagic necrotizing pancreatitis. Acute hemorrhagic necrotizing pancreatitis (AHNP) was induced by introduct retrograde injection of the autologous bile in canine. The cryoprobe was under the influence of temperature ranging from -160C to -190C for fifteen to eighteen seconds, and the frozen areas were about 80% surface of pancreas. Cryotherapy of AHNP strongly inhibited the development of the inflammation in pancreatic parenchyma. Postcryotherapy 24hr for remarkably decreased the activities of pancreatic enzymes. The activities of phospholipase A, lipase and amylase in serum decreased by 502.1%, 355.8%, 502.5% respectively in 7 days. The level of blood glucose decreased. At the second week, the fibroblasts were growing around the residual pancreatic aciner cells and insular cells rich in intact zymogen granules. The mortality (6.89%) of the treatment group within 48 hours was significantly lower than that of the control group (100%).
