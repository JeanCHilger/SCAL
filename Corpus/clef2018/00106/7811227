Pancreatic lesions in HIV-infected patients. The pancreas is frequently involved during HIV infection, especially by disseminated infections or neoplasms. These lesions are generally asymptomatic and are discovered at autopsy. However, hypoglycaemia secondary to massive pancreatic infiltration by a tumour or tuberculous necrosis may occur. The most important cause of pancreatic dysfunction in HIV-infected patients is a drug toxic effect (intravenous pentamidine, didanosine, zalcitabine). Hypoglycaemia, which may or may not be followed by diabetes, can develop during intravenous pentamidine therapy. In cases with increased serum amylase and/or lipase levels, potentially toxic drugs must be promptly discontinued to avoid major pancreatic involvement.
