Current status of surgical transduodenal papillotomy. The treatment of biliary lithiasis has changed during the past 20 years. Cholecystectomy remains the gold standard for cholelithiasis, but many options are available for calculi of the common bile duct. Among them are surgical open or laparoscopic choledochotomy, biliary-enteric anastomosis, transduodenal sphincterotomy (TDS), endoscopic sphincterotomy. With the aim to describe the current place of TDS, we reviewed the patients operated on in our department between 1976 and 1992. We found 78 patients with a mean age of 58 years (26-89 years). 34 (43%) of them had acute cholecystitis, with 26 being operated on urgently. 47 (60%) were jaundiced, 15 (19%) had pancreatitis and 12 (15%) had cholangitis before operation. Indications for TDS have been impacted stone or absence of progression of the contrast medium on intraoperative cholangiography in 71 patients (91%). 3 patients died (1 pulmonary embolism, 1 sepsis of pulmonary origin, 1 MOF syndrome complicating preoperative necrotizing pancreatitis). 30 patients (38%) had complications, of which 20 were directly related to TDS. Hemorrhage occurred in 4 cases, and resolved spontaneously without transfusion. Hyperamylasemia occurred in 17 instances, but clinical pancreatitis developed in only 1 case, with complete resolution. 1 duodenal fistula healed after conservative therapy. No death is attributable directly to TDS. Today, the importance of endoscopic sphincterotomy is increasing. This retrospective study shows that TDS, if performed with caution, does not increase the operative risks even in emergent operations. During surgical exploration of the common bile duct, TDS is indicated to remove an impacted stone, or as a bilio-enteric anastomosis if multiple stones are present with a thin common duct.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
