Pancreatitis associated with salmonella. There is no general agreement about the possibility that pancreatitis could be regarded as a clinical complication of Salmonella infection. We report 2 cases of salmonellosis WHO were admitted to our Department for clinical and biological signs of pancreatitis. Our observation agrees with other reported cases, suggesting that patients affected by salmonellosis with upper abdominal pain should be investigated for concomitant pancreatitis on the other hand in patients suffering from diarrhea with hyperamylasaemia, salmonellosis should be considered as a likely explanation for their clinical condition.
