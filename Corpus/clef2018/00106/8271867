Acute pancreatitis in newly diagnosed type I diabetes mellitus with diabetic ketoacidosis and hypertriglyceridemia. A 19 years old patient who presented grade D acute pancreatitis by abdominal CT with marked hypertriglyceridemia during a diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in the onset of a type I diabetes mellitus is described. The pancreatitis and DKA were resolved with the usual treatment, and the levels of triglycerides became normal within one week. Hyperamylasemia is frequent in DKA although of uncertain significance. Acute pancreatitis coinciding with DKA has been described, in this case radiologic findings demonstrated the diagnosis. No other bibliographic references have been found in which pathologic imaging in abdominal CT are described in a situation of DKA with hyperamylasemia. Moderate hypertriglyceridemia is common upon initiation of diabetes mellitus and likewise it usually presents during the course of acute pancreatitis. Pancreatitis could be secondary to hypertriglyceridemia and the latter to the insulin deficiency.
