Pancreatic scanning in diagnosis of macroamylasemia: case report. Macroamylasemia and acute pancreatitis are both associated with a high serum amylase. The former is an incidental laboratory finding and seems to have no apparent clinical significance or specificity. On the other hand, acute pancreatitis is a serious illness demanding recognition and treatment. Persistently normal pancreatic scans convincingly exclude acute pancreatitis and should alert one to the possible presence of macroamylasemia.
