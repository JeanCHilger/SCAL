Update on laboratory diagnosis and prognosis of acute pancreatitis. In this review, the relative values of serum pancreatic enzyme assays and other laboratory tests for diagnosis and prognosis of acute pancreatitis have been evaluated. It is concluded that serum lipase measurement should be the preferred diagnostic method since it is as simple and accurate as amylase assay, all the while being more specific. As for prognosis, among the several biochemical tests now available, the most useful for clinical practice is serum C-reactive protein determination.
