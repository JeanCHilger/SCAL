Clinical and analytical evaluation of a continuous enzymatic method for measuring pancreatic lipase activity. We report the evaluation of a new commercial kit for the determination of pancreatic lipase activity. The kit is based on the use of a 1,2-diglyceride as substrate and a specific monoglyceride lipase. The detection step is the continuous colorimetric measurement of hydrogen peroxide produced from glycerol by glycerol kinase, glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase, and peroxidase reactions. The procedure appears to be precise (between-day CV < 9%) and the results show good correlation with those obtained by alternative procedures (vs turbidimetry, r = 0.965 vs ultraviolet absorbance-enzymatic method, r = 0.995
