Risk factors associated with acute pancreatitis in dogs: 101 cases (1985-1990). The medical records of 101 dogs with acute pancreatitis, diagnosed on the basis of medical histories of acute vomiting, with serum lipase or amylase activity greater than the reference range, or with gross signs of pancreatitis at surgery or histopathologic evidence at necropsy, were evaluated to identify potential risk factors for the development of acute pancreatitis. Age, sex, and breed of dogs with acute pancreatitis were compared with those from a reference population of 100 dogs admitted for other medical emergencies during the same period. Analysis of multiple regression models indicated that dogs > 7 years old were at increased risk for acute pancreatitis. Spayed dogs and castrated male dogs had an increased risk, compared with that of sexually intact males. Similarly, terrier and nonsporting breeds appeared to be at higher risk of developing acute pancreatitis than were other breed types. Most dogs in this study (63/101) had intercurrent diseases, including diabetes mellitus (n = 14), hyperadrenocorticism (n = 12), chronic renal failure (n = 8), neoplasia (n = 17), congestive heart failure (n = 6), and autoimmune disorders (n = 5). Fourteen dogs had undergone anesthesia or surgery in the week before admission only 3 had undergone abdominal procedures. Recent medication use was listed in 52 of 101 cases. Antibiotics (n = 18) and corticosteroids (n = 18) were most frequently described. Anticancer chemotherapeutic agents (n = 5) and organophosphate insecticides (n = 5) also were listed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
