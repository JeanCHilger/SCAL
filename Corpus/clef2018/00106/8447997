Acute pancreatitis. The patient with acute pancreatitis requires constant assessments and interventions to minimize pancreatic inflammation and promote early detection and treatment of systemic complications. The onset of acute pancreatitis is most commonly initiated by biliary or alcohol disease, although many other causes have identified. The course of the disease may range from mild to fulminant based on the degree of pancreatic necrosis. Significant clinical symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may present with signs of hypovolemic shock, with associated sequestration of fluid in the peritoneum as a result of inflammatory and mediated responses. Laboratory evidence of the disease includes increased levels of amylase and lipase, although a definitive diagnosis cannot be made without radiographic tests. Multisystem failure can occur in necrotizing acute pancreatitis as a result of mediators that are activated by the proteolytic enzymes, normally produced by the pancreas, and released into the peritoneum by injured cells. Collaborative management of the patient includes therapies directed at correcting initiating events, hemodynamic stabilization, and supportive measures to rest the pancreas and resolve presenting clinical symptoms. The management of multisystem organ failure that can result from necrotizing pancreatitis is a multidisciplinary challenge.
