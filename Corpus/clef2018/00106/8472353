Characteristics and clinical application of a radiometric Escherichia coli-based phospholipase A2 assay modified for serum analysis. Determination of activities of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) in human sera was based on the hydrolysis of phospholipids from [1-14C]oleic acid-labeled Escherichia coli biomembranes. The E. coli membranes served as substrate specifically for the PLA2 of human serum and were essentially resistant to other lipases in human sera, i.e., lipoprotein lipases, hepatic triacylglycerolipase, or pancreatic lipase in acute pancreatitis. Exchange of phospholipids between the serum and the biomembrane compartment aggravates the determination of PLA2 activity in human serum, which is naturally rich in phospholipids. In our modified E. coli assay, which overcomes these difficulties, the main substrate components phosphatidylethanolamine (70%) and cardiolipin (25%) were > 90% labeled in the sn-2 position. Fatty acids released by PLA2 activity were eluted from an aminopropyl solid-phase column directly into scintillation vials, where the radioactivity was counted. The ratio of [1-14C]oleic acid to released total fatty acids was used to calculate true enzymatic activity. The linear assay range extended from 0 to 3.6 U/L (0-60 nkat/L), with a detection limit of < 0.03 U/L (< 0.5 nkat/L). Within-assay imprecision (CV) was < 6% and between-assay is < 10% over the whole activity range. The normal range for men was 0-0.44 U/L (0-7.33 nkat/L) and for women 0.044-1.11 U/L (0.73-18.4 nkat/L). Patients with septicemia, pancreatitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or other severe diseases had PLA2 values up to 540 U/L (9000 nkat/L).
