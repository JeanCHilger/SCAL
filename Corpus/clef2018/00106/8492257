Pancreatic function and congenital duodenal anomalies. Six children operated on for congenital anomalies of the duodenum were investigated to find out if pancreatic dysfunction was associated with the duodenal malformation, even in the absence of clinical evidence of pancreatic insufficiency. None of the children had diarrhea and none requested nutritional support. Pancreatic function was assessed by enzyme activities (lipase, trypsin, and chymotrypsin) bicarbonate and calcium measurements in pancreatic juice obtained through a nasoduodenal tube under stimulation by secretin and cerulein. Results showed no significant modification in hydro-electrolytic secretion, but impairment of enzymatic secretion was seen. The physiopathological relationship between duodenal anomalies and pancreatic dysfunction is discussed.
