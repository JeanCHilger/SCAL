Effects of the cholecystokinin receptor antagonist L-364,718 on pancreatitis induced by a deficient in choline and supplemented with ethionine (CDE) diet in the rat. The role of cholecystokinin (CCK) in the development of a necrotizing acute pancreatitis induced by a diet deficient in choline and supplemented with ethionine (CDE) has been evaluated in the rat by using a potent CCK receptor antagonist L-364,718. Acute pancreatitis was induced by administration of CDE diet for 14 days. L-364,718 administration was carried out by subcutaneous injections at dose of 0.1 mg/kg/day. Pancreatic exocrine secretion (flow, protein, amylase and trypsin outputs) in resting and under infusion of 1.25 microgram/kg/h of CCK-8 were used to evaluate the pancreatic functionality. Others parameters (serum amylase, percentage fluid in pancreas, haematocrit and mortality) evaluated the severity of pancreatitis. L-364,718 slightly reduced the mortality and the increases of percentage of fluid accumulated in pancreas in CDE diet acute pancreatitis. Basal and CCK stimulated pancreatic secretion was significantly depressed 36 hours after L-364,718 treatment. A slight response to CCK was observed. Nevertheless it was lower than usually observed in control rats. Our results demonstrate that in the rat, chronic L-364,718 treatment did not completely restore pancreatic activity in acute pancreatitis induced by CDE diet. Hence CCK cannot be considered as the main factor involved in the development of this pancreatitis model.
