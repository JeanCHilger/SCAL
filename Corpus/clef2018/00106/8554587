TGF-beta 1 overexpression in murine pancreas induces chronic pancreatitis and, together with TNF-alpha, triggers insulin-dependent diabetes. We have generated transgenic mice overexpressing TGF-beta 1 in pancreatic beta cells. This resulted in massive fibrosis of the pancreas in adult mice, most of the acini were replaced by fibrotic and adipose tissues. A conspicuous disorganization of the islets of Langerhans was also observed
