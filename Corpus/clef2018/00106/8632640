Effect of the somatostatin analogue octreotide on experimental pancreatitis in rats. Somatostatin and its analogue octreotide have a profound inhibitory effect on the endocrine and exocrine secretions of the pancreas, stomach, and small intestine. Previous studies have been inconclusive about the possible therapeutic effect of somatostatin and its analogues in the treatment of pancreatitis. This study assessed the effect of the long acting somatostatin analogue, octreotide, in two models of experimental pancreatitis in rats. Necrotizing pancreatitis was induced by pancreatic injection of 5 ml taurocholate, 5% in male Wistar rats. In a second model mild edematous pancreatitis was induced by intravenous injection of caerulein at a supramaximal dose, 6 micrograms/kg/hr, for 5 hr. Compared to untreated rats, treatment with octreotide either prior to or following the induction of necrotizing pancreatitis resulted in less hypocalcemia (P < 0.05) and acidosis (P < 0.05), and prevented the increase in pancreatic weight (P < 0.05). Amylase levels remained high. After 20 days, there was less pancreatic damage, lower mortality rates (P < 0.05), and increase in body weight (P < 0.05). In the model of milder pancreatitis, octreotide treatment attenuated the increase in pancreatic weight (P < 0.05) and pathological damage (P < 0.05). We concluded that the somatostatin analogue octreotide has a beneficial effect in the treatment of experimental acute pancreatitis.
