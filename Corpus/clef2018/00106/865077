Foreign serum-induced pancreatitis in mice. II. Secretory disturbances of acinar cells. As previously reported, pancreatic acinar cell necrosis and inflammation develop in mice a few hours after one intraperitoneal injection of foreign serum. However, sublethally injured acinar cells exhibited notable increases in both zymogen granule numbers and amylase activity, observed within 3 hours and increasing with time. These two changes were coupled with a progressive decrease in the secretory response to pilocarpine and were preceded by significant disturbances in pancreatic tissue concentrations of sodium and potassium. We conclude that (1) the granule increase results from an induced disturbance of the granule exocytosis mechanism while granule formation continues and, therefore, (2) the granule secretory process is more sensitive to the serum injury mechanism than is the zymogen synthesis process. Although the granule increases developed in acinar cells throughout most of the nonnecrotic gland and persisted for at least 24 hours, acinar cell necrosis was maximal in extent--approximately 25% of the gland in severest form--by 12 to 15 hours. We conclude, therefore, that the increase in granules is neither the primary determinant nor initiator of acinar cell death. The latter is likely caused by disturbed plasma membrane functions, sufficient in some cells to result in  lethal changes in ion and fluid composition. The injury mechanism, which permits granule formation to go on in the face of impaired granule exocytosis, is yet to be worked out. The possibilities are discussed in relationship to the reactivity of foreign sera for target cell plasma membranes.
