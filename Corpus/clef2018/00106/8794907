Detection of alpha-hydroxyethyl free radical adducts in the pancreas after chronic exposure to alcohol in the rat. Chronic pancreatitis is characterized by inflammation and fibrosis leading to tissue destruction in industrialized nations, alcohol abuse is the cause of 70-80% of cases of pancreatitis in adults. The purpose of the current work was to determine whether free radical adducts are produced by the pancreas during the early phases of chronic exposure to ethanol. Accordingly, rats were chronically fed ethanol using the model of continuous enteral infusion developed by Tsukamoto et al.[Am. J. Physiol. 247: R595-R599 (1984)]. Histological evaluation revealed only mild acinar steatosis and spotty necrosis after 4 weeks of alcohol treatment
