Acute pancreatitis with diabetic ketoacidosis associated with hypermyoglobinemia, acute renal failure, and DIC. We report a case of acute pancreatitis with diabetic ketoacidosis associated with increased serum myoglobin concentration, acute renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. A 49-year-old man suffering from diarrhea, vomiting, and somnolence was admitted to the hospital. He had had flu-like symptoms for 4 days prior to the onset of these symptoms. He was a habitual drinker and had been consuming 360 ml-900 ml of the drink "shochu" (distilled spirits containing 28% alcohol) daily for 30 years. Laboratory data on admission revealed elevated serum levels of pancreatic enzymes, including amylase, trypsin, lipase, pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (PSTI), phospholipase A2 (PLA2), and elastase-1, as well as elevated levels of glucose (373 mg/dl), ketone bodies (3675 mumol/l), and myoglobin (229.8 ng/ml). Treatment with subcutaneous insulin and intravenous administration of electrolyte fluid and the systemic protease inhibitor, gabexate mesilate, was begun immediately. Early after the initiation of treatment, there was an increase in serum creatinine (4.9 mg/dl), and thromobocytopenia (15000/microliters) was observed. The patient completely recovered from renal failure and acute pancreatitis, but required insulin therapy. Alcohol ingestion and dehydration are thought to have played a major role in the triggering of the acute pancreatitis. We examined the relationship among acute pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, and hypermyoglobinemia in the literature.
