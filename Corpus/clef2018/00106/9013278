Role of hypertriglyceridemia in the pathogenesis of experimental acute pancreatitis in rats. The pancreatic damage initiated via different pathogenetic pathways can be increased by triglycerides. Thus, triglycerides seem to play an important role in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis.Lipolytic enzymes and their substrates may play a role in the pathogenesis of acute necrotizing pancreatitis. We investigated, therefore, whether triglycerides alter the course of acute pancreatitis in three experimental models of rats.1. Edematous acute pancreatitis induced by repeated sc injections of cerulein 2. Necrotizing acute pancreatitis by retrograde duct injection of sodium taurocholateIn both cerulein and taurocholate acute pancreatitis, amylase/lipase activities were significantly higher compared to controls during 45 min of perfusion. In both models, addition of triglycerides caused a dose-dependent marked elevation of enzymes. Ligation (a) did not cause any rise in enzymes in the venous effluent triglycerides had no effect. Ligation (b) or (c) caused a significant increase of pancreatic enzymes, which was further increased by triglycerides. Histology showed various degrees of severity of tissue damage depending on the model used. The additional damaging effect of a 45-min perfusion with triglycerides, however, could not be detected by histology.
