The time course of ultrastructural changes in the secretory components of pancreatic acinar cells and trypsinogen activation in taurocholate pancreatitis in rats. The purpose of this study was to compare a time course of ultrastructural changes of secretory compartment of acinar cells in the pancreas, and a pattern of trypsinogen activation during the course of taurocholate acute pancreatitis (AP) in rats. Acute pancreatitis was induced in 21 rats by injection 0.2 ml of 5% natrium taurocholate into the biliopancreatic duct. Control rats (n = 18) were sham operated (SO). The ultrastructural and biochemical (trypsinogen activation, free active [FAT] and total potential trypsin [TPT]) examinations were performed after 6, 12 and 18 h of AP or SO. Ultrastructural lesions of acinar cells comprised of disorganization of RER, enlargement of Golgi apparatus, changes in size, shape and number of zymogen granules. These alterations were most conspicuous after 6 h of AP and they were associated with maximal activation of trypsinogen. Biochemical changes gradually normalized at 12 to 18 h of AP, however the morphological lesions persisted at these intervals of time.
