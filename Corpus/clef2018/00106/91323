Molecular forms of immunoreactive pancreatic cationic trypsin in pancreatitis patient sera. The molecular forms of immunoreactive pancreatic cationic trypsin in sera of patients with acute pancreatic inflammation have been characterized using a radioimmunoassay technique that is capable of detecting trypsinogen as well as trypsin bound to alpha 1-antitrypsin. Trypsin bound to alpha 2-macroglobulin is not immunoreactive under normal assay conditions. However, alpha 2-macroglobulin-bound trypsin can be detected after gel filtration of serum on Bio-Gel A-0.5 m and acid treatment of column fractions. The average serum level of immunoreactive cationic trypsin from 20 patients with acute pancreatic inflammation was 1,590 ng/ml. An average normal value of 26 ng/ml has been obtained previously. Serum samples from 14 patients with pancreatic inflammation were chromatographed under conditions that resolve trypsinogen, alpha 1-antitrypsin-bound trypsin, and alpha 2-macroglobulin-bound trypsin. In each case, the major portion of the immunoreactive material eluted at a position corresponding to free trypsinogen, while a minor fraction of the immunoreactive material appeared to be trypsin bound to alpha 1-antitrypsin. The zymogen nature of the major peak was confirmed in one case by activation with human enteropeptidase. In 11 of 14 patients, acid treatment of the alpha 2-macroglobulin peak yielded immunoreactive trypsin.
