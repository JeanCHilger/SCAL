Effects of early ductal decompression in human biliary acute pancreatitis. It was recently demonstrated in experimental models that, after pancreatic outflow obstruction, serum amylase levels first increase and then progressively decline regardless of whether the obstruction was maintained or relieved. Furthermore, early decompression of the ductal biliary system may prevent the progression of the disease. This finding prompted us to look for a similar pattern in patients with obstructive acute pancreatitis due to biliary stones. Forty-two patients with biliary acute pancreatitis were prospectively studied. Twenty-one patients underwent urgent endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES), and 21 received conservative medical treatment (CMT). The two groups were comparable for sex, age, onset of pain, and severity. Serum amylase and lipase were determined in all patients on admission and 24 h later. The percentage variation of serum amylase and lipase was calculated considering, for each patient, the concentrations of the two enzymes assayed on admission and 24 h later. On admission, all patients had elevated serum concentrations of amylase (mean +/- SEM: ES, 2,560+/-473 U/L CMT, 1,783+/-481 U/L) and lipase (ES, 3,037+/-574 U/L
