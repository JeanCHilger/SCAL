Experimental study on the therapeutic effects of SMS201-995 on bile-induced acute pancreatitis in the dog. We studied the effects of SMS201-995, a long-acting somatostatin analogue, on bile-induced acute pancreatitis in the dog. According to morphometrical study, parenchymal necrotic ratio, zymogen granules area and zymogen granules occupied ratio of acinus were significantly decreased in SMS-treated pancreatitis. These results suggests that SMS-treated pancreatitis showed less damage than non-treated ones and decreased secretion of pancreatic enzyme. On the other hand, pancreatic blood flow showed a stronger decrease in SMS-treated dogs than in non-treated ones, and a significant difference was observed at 15 minutes and 1 hour after induction of pancreatitis. Many clinical and experimental evidences suggest that pancreatic ischemia causes acute pancreatitis. Pancreatitis may be worsened by an early phase treatment with SMS201-995, because this substance reduces pancreatic tissue blood flow. The harmful effect of this substance on pancreatic tissue blood flow must be kept in mind when SMS201-995 is used for therapeutic purpose of acute pancreatitis.
