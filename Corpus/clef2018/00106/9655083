Ischemia/reperfusion injury of the pancreas: a new animal model. Ischemia/reperfusion is thought to play an important role in the development of postimplantation pancreatitis after pancreas transplantation and also in the transition of edematous pancreatitis into necrotizing pancreatitis. Previous studies have suggested that impairment of microcirculation and hence tissue oxygenation and energy metabolism may be critical steps in this process.In landrace pigs vascular isolation of the pancreatic tail was performed. Morphological alterations, tissue oxygenation, and energy metabolism were assessed in response to 3 h of global warm ischemia and the following reperfusion.A rapid onset of morphological alterations immediately after reperfusion was noted. Oxygen consumption and ATP levels were markedly decreased, and tissue oxygenation was severely impaired especially during the first hour after reperfusion. ATP tissue levels and oxygen consumption 10 min after reperfusion correlated significantly with the morphological changes at the end of the experiment.These findings can be explained by a failure of nutritive capillary perfusion and concomitant shunt perfusion. Therefore an impaired microcirculation rather than an impaired oxygen utilization shortly after reperfusion is of major relevance in the development of the ischemia/reperfusion injury of the pancreas.
