Changes in blood enzyme activity and tumor necrosis factor level in the treatment of experimental pancreatitis with pentoxifylline. It was established in an acute experiment on rats of Wistar line while an acute pancreatitis simulation using the pancreatic tissue freezing that the level of a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in a blood serum was maximal in 4 hours from the cold action onset, the activity of amylase and trypsin was heightened and trypsin activity inhibitor (TAI) had lowered. Intraperitoneal application of pentoxifylline in 100 mg/kg dose twice daily have promoted the significant lowering of TNF contents, the amylase and trypsin activity as well, and the TAI concentration increase.
