Serum interleukin 6 in the prognosis of acute biliary pancreatitis. Data concerning the interleukin 6 pattern in acute biliary pancreatitis are lacking.To define the best cut-off point of this molecule in differentiating the severe form of acute biliary pancreatitis from the mild form and to evaluate its sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy in the prognosis of acute biliary pancreatitis in comparison with those of serum C-reactive protein.Forty-four patients with acute biliary pancreatitis: 27 patients with mild pancreatitis and 17 with the severe form of the disease.Serum interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein concentrations were assessed in all patients on admission and for the following 5 days.Serum interleukin-6 levels were significantly higher (p < 0.02) in patients with severe acute biliary pancreatitis than in those with the mild form of the disease. No significant difference in serum C-reactive protein levels was found in the first 2 days in patients with mild biliary pancreatitis when compared to those with the severe form of the disease. Using a cut-off point of 2.7 pg/ml for serum interleukin-6 and 11 mg/dl for serum C-reactive protein, the sensitivity of the two molecules in assessing the severity of acute pancreatitis on the first day of the study was 87.5% for interleukin-6 and 6.3% for C-reactive protein, the specificity, 83.3% for interleukin-6 and 91.7% for C-reactive protein, and the accuracy 85.0% for interleukin-6 and 57.5% for C-reactive protein.Serum determination of interleukin-6 in the first 24 hours of the disease is a better marker of the severity of acute biliary pancreatitis than C-reactive protein.
