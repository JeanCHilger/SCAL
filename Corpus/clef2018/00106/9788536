Metallothionein protects against cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis: analysis using transgenic mice. Oxidative stress has been proposed to play a role in the early events of acute pancreatitis, and metallothionein (MT) can provide protection against oxidative stress. Using transgenic mice, we characterized the effects of depletion of MT-I and -II, or overexpression of MT-I, on pancreatic responses during cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis. In MT-I/-II knockout mice, repeated injections of cerulein caused (a) higher serum amylase levels at 3 and 7 h after the initiation of acute pancreatitis (b) earlier and stronger upregulation of oxidative stress-responsive genes, including heme oxygenase (HO)-1 and c-fos
