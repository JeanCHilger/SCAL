Portal but not peripheral serum levels of interleukin 6 could interfere with glucose metabolism in patients with pancreatic cancer. Interleukin 6 (IL-6), an autocrine growth factor for many tumors, seems to favour tumor spread to the liver. Our aims were first to evaluate the pattern of portal and systemic IL-6 levels in patients with pancreatic cancer (PC, n = 18) and chronic pancreatitis (CP, n = 22) compared with controls (CS, n = 20) and second, to ascertain whether there was any relation between IL-6 levels and tumor spread or PC-associated Diabetes mellitus. For all subjects, a fasting serum sample was obtained from a cubital vein(1) Portal IL-6, which is partly of pancreatic origin, is first metabolised in the liver (2) Systemic IL-6 reflects hepatic and renal functions rather than local conditions in the pancreas
