Experimental studies on the aetiology of acute scorpion pancreatitis. This study examined the action of the venom of the scorpion Tityus trintatis on the pancreas and gastrointestinal tract in anaesthetized dogs, on the isolated extracorporeal haemoperfused canine pancreas and on the isolated canine sphincter of Oddi. The venom induces exocrine secretion in both the isolated and intact pancreas and causes contraction of the isolated sphincter of Oddi. These results are discussed in relation to the pathogenesis of acute scorpion pancreatitis and possibly of some other forms of acute pancreatitis.
