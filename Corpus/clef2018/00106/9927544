Cytokine suppressive agent improves survival rate in rats with acute pancreatitis of closed duodenal loop. This study was designed to evaluate the possible role of cytokines (IL-1 and TNF-alpha) in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis in the early stage of the disease and to evaluate the protective effect of the cytokine suppressive agent, FR167653, against pancreatic injuries. Acute pancreatitis was induced in rats by closed duodenal loop. However, the free passage for the gastrointestinal contents was maintained by inserting the tube into the duodenum. In this model, the survival rate was significantly decreased as compared with the control sham-operated rats at 48 h after induction of pancreatitis. Marked hyperamylasemia and a significant increase in pancreatic water and trypsin contents were observed at 24 h after induction of pancreatitis. Pancreatic subcellular redistribution of lysosomal enzyme cathepsin B from the lysosomal fraction to the zymogen fraction was also observed. However, treatment with FR167653 at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg (four times, every 6 h after induction of pancreatitis) significantly prevented all these pancreatic injuries, improving the survival rate. These results indicate that cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-alpha may be involved in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis in the early stage of the disease, and that a cytokine-suppressive agent might be of therapeutic value for the treatment of acute pancreatitis.
