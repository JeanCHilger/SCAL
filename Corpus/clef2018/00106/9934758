Proinflammatory cytokines in early assessment of the prognosis of acute pancreatitis. Proinflammatory cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis. The value of serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1-beta, interleukin-6, and interleukin-8 in predicting the outcome of acute pancreatitis was evaluated.In 50 patients with acute pancreatitis, the serum concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1-beta, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and C-reactive protein were determined on days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 after admission. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) scores were recorded on days 1, 2, and 3.Serum concentrations of interleukin-1-beta, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and C-reactive protein on days 1-7 were significantly higher in patients with severe pancreatitis than in patients with mild pancreatitis. Patients with severe attacks had significantly elevated serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha concentrations on days 1-3 compared with those with mild attacks, but not on days 4 and 7. The median peak value of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1-beta, interleukin-6, and interleukin-8 was reached on day 1, in contrast to the median peak of C-reactive protein, which was reached on day 2. Using cutoff levels of 12 pg/ml for tumor necrosis factor-alpha, 1 pg/ml for interleukin-1-beta, 400 pg/ml for interleukin-6, 100 pg/ml for interleukin-8, 12 mg/dl for C-reactive protein, and 10 for the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score, the accuracy rates for detecting severe pancreatitis were 72%, 82%, 88%, 74%, 80%, and 72%, respectively, on day 1 and 78%, 74%, 80%, 76%, 80%, and 78%, respectively, on day 2.Among the proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin-6 is the most useful parameter for early prediction of the prognosis of acute pancreatitis.
