Acute renal failure in patients with acute pancreatitis. We describe five patients with acute pancreatitis in whom acute renal failure developed in the absence of hypotension. Pancreatitis was diagnosed clinically, with mean serum and urinary amylase levels of 766 +/- 197 (SE) and 2,378 +/- 572 units/100 ml, respectively. Acute renal failure developed within 24 hours after admission in all patients. It was manifested by oliguria, elevated levels of serum creatinine (mean, 6.9 +/- 1.1 mg/100 ml) and BUN (105 +/-28 mg/100 ml) a urinary sodium level of 72.0 +/- 6.6 mEq/liter
