Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of pancreatitis--diagnostic relevance of clinical and biochemical changes during the course of the disease and of endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (author's transl). In order to classify a patient with pancreatitis according to the Marseille clasiffication the following criteria must be fulfilled: (a) an acute attach of pancreatitis must be observed, (b) the cause of pancreatitis has to be established, (c) the patient has to be followed over longer periods of time in order to find out, whether the process becomes chronic (involving progredient endocrine and exocrine insufficiency). Diagnostic problems of acute pancreatitis, relapsing pancreatitis, and chronic pancreatitis are discussed taking into account the author's own results. It is concluded, that repeated tests of pancreatitis function and demonstration of pancreatic calcification are more important for establishing the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis than studies of pancreatic morphology including endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP). ERP may help to find the cause of relapsing pancreatitis of unknown origine it may help as well preoperatively to diagnose local changes of the pancreatic duct system in chronic pancreatitis.
