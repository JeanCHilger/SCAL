Acute pancreatitis associated with viral hepatitis: a report of six cases with review of literature. Association of hepatitis viruses with acute pancreatitis in the setting of nonfulminant viral hepatitis is rare. We report six cases of nonfulminant viral hepatitis complicated by acute pancreatitis, including the first documented case of hepatitis E virus (HEV) associated acute pancreatitis. The other five patients had acute viral hepatitis caused by hepatitis A infection. Besides features of viral hepatitis, the presence of typical abdominal pain, high serum amylase, and ultrasound or CT scan features suggested the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. This complication generally developed in the initial phase of the hepatitic illness. All of the patients had mild to moderate pancreatitis that recovered uneventfully with conservative treatment.
