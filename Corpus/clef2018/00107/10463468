No microheterogenous changes of plasma C-reactive protein found in man during various diseases. Increased levels of the acute phase protein C-reactive protein (CRP) in plasma may indicate severe acute abdominal disease, risk of serious postoperative complications or malignancy serial measurements may indicate postoperative complications, relapse of intra-abdominal sepsis and complications during acute pancreatitis. The increase in CRP is an unspecific acute phase reaction, however, and low levels do not exclude these conditions. These facts are important obstacles to the clinical routine use of CRP measurements. The aim of this study was to look for possible biochemical microheterogeneity of CRP in single plasma samples from various large groups of patients to overcome these problems. Two-hundred-and-twelve patients with acute abdominal diseases, 274 patients with various forms and stages of cancer and 134 patients operated on due to benign diseases, were studied. The biochemical studies included SDS-PAGE, native PAGE and gel filtration for molecular weight determinations, isoelectric focusing and crossed immuno-electrophoresis for electrophoretic mobility studies and Concavalin A and ACA 34 as intermediary gels for possible lectin binding or complexation. Western blot analysis was also used to identify CRP. In summary, however, these more elaborate biochemical methods could not disclose any microheterogneity of CRP in plasma and thus did not add any diagnostic information to the crude levels.
