Abdominal aortic aneurysm compression is probably responsible for the recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis: case report. An aged male with a known history of abdominal aortic aneurysm suffered from epigastralgia, vomiting and cold sweating for one day. According to the physical examination, serum amylase level and computed tomographic examination, acute pancreatitis was diagnosed. Surgical intervention for the abdominal aortic aneurysm was not performed because of his age, and finally this patient died after three recurrent episodes. Acute pancreatitis co-existing with an intact abdominal aortic aneurysm has never been reported before. The possible pathogenesis of this recurrent acute pancreatitis was discussed.
