Melatonin reduces lipid peroxidation and tissue edema in cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in rats. Since oxygen free radicals and lipid peroxidation have been implicated in the pathogenesis of an early stage of acute pancreatitis, we examined whether melatonin, a recently discovered free-radical scavenger, could attenuate pancreatic injury in Sprague-Dawley rats with cerulein-induced pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis was induced by four intraperitoneal injections of cerulein (50 microg/kg body wt) given at 1-hr intervals. Thirty minutes after the last cerulein injection, the rats were killed and the degree of pancreatic edema, the level of lipid peroxidation in the pancreas, and serum amylase activity were increased significantly. Pretreatment with melatonin (10 or 50 mg/kg body wt) 30 min before each cerulein injection resulted in a significant reduction in pancreatic edema and the levels of lipid peroxidation. Serum amylase activity, however, was not significantly influenced by either dose of melatonin. Moreover, we found that cerulein administration was associated with stomach edema as well as high levels of lipid peroxidation in the stomach and small intestine, which were also reduced by melatonin. Melatonin's protective effects in cerulein-treated rats presumably relate to its radical scavenging ability and to other antioxidative processes induced by melatonin.
