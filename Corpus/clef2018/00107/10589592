Cholecystokinin in the early course of acute post-ERCP pancreatitis. A high dose of cholecystokinin (CCK) agonist cerulein can induce acute pancreatitis in animals. The role of CCK in the induction of acute pancreatitis in humans is unclear. We investigated basal plasma CCK levels before and after induction of post-ERCP pancreatitis to determine CCK levels in the early course of the disease.We determined plasma CCK concentrations in four groups of patients who underwent ERCP: (1) post-ERCP pancreatitis patients (n = 23) (2) patients with post-ERCP hyperamylasemia without pancreatitis (n = 5)Plasma CCK levels increased five-fold early in the course in post-ERCP pancreatitis patients, but not in post-ERCP hyperamylasemia patients or in uncomplicated ERCP patients, where CCK levels temporarily decreased after ERCP. In patients with abdominal pain, CCK levels did not change. After the early increase, plasma CCK levels declined to almost unmeasurable levels one day after the onset of symptoms in post-ERCP pancreatitis. In other groups CCK levels were close to the pre-ERCP level.It remains to be shown whether CCK is important in the pathogenesis of post-ERCP pancreatitis or merely a secondary phenomenon. There is a rationale to test CCK antagonists in preventing post-ERCP pancreatitis.
