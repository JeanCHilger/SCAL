H(2)O(2) and PARS mediate lung P-selectin upregulation in acute pancreatitis. P-selectin and circulating xanthine oxidase are involved in the process of neutrophil infiltration into the lung associated with acute pancreatitis. This study investigated the mediators that trigger the upregulation of P-selectin in this process. Pancreatitis was induced in rats by intraductal administration of 5% sodium taurocholate. P-selectin expression was measured using radiolabeled antibodies. Neutrophil infiltration and PAF levels were also evaluated. The role of superoxide radical, H(2)O(2), or the enzyme poly (ADP-ribose) synthetase (PARS) on these processes was determined in groups of animals treated with the corresponding inhibitors. Pancreatitis was associated with an increase in P-selectin expression in the lung. Inhibition of PARS or H(2)O(2) abrogated P-selectin upregulation, PAF generation, and neutrophil recruitment. Superoxide dismutation prevented neutrophil recruitment and PAF generation, but had no effect on P-selectin expression. We conclude that during acute pancreatitis, upregulation of P-selectin in the pulmonary endothelium is triggered by H(2)O(2) and PARS activity.
