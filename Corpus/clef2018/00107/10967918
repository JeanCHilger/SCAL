Levels of alpha-amylase, C-reactive protein and lipoprotein (a) in acute pancreatitis. On the course of acute pancreatitis which occurred in 30 patients treated in our clinic changes in levels of alpha-amylase, C-reactive protein and lipoprotein (a) were monitoring during 7 days of hospitalisation talking into account the severity and aetiology of disease. The highest level of the alpha-amylase were observed in 1-st day, C-reactive protein in 3-rd day and lipoprotein (a) in 7-th day of observation. These parameters are very useful to monitoring course and heaviness of acute pancreatitis.
