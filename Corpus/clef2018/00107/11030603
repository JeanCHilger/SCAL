Mechanisms of intracellular zymogen activation. The pancreatic acinar cell is potentially the initial site of injury that begins the series of events leading to acute pancreatitis. Pathological intrapancreatic zymogen activation occurs in experimental pancreatitis in animals and in human pancreatitis. Intracellular activation has been clearly linked to aberrant zymogen processing in one form of hereditary pancreatitis in this genetic disease a mutation in cationic trypsinogen may eliminate the degradation of any trypsin activated in the acinar cell. Recent studies have also provided the first direct evidence that trypsinogen activation takes place early in the course of caerulein-induced pancreatitis
