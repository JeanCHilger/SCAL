Laparoscopic cholecystectomy and perioperative ERCP. Study of acceptance of simultaneous laparoscopic cholecystectomy and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography for treatment of cholelithiasis with choledocholithiasis.There were 25 patients. Ten patients had acute pancreatitis of biliary etiology, accompanied by transitory icterus. In 15 patients, choledocholithiasis was suspected preoperatively both on ultrasonography and i.v. cholangiography. In all patients laparoscopic cholecystectomy with perioperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and sphincterotomy were performed for the treatment of cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis.Simultaneous laparoscopic cholecystectomy and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was successfully done in all patients. The patients were discharged home on the 4th day after the surgery. Concerning early complications, there where 3 early complications, e.g., prolonged hemorrhage after papillotomy in a patient with choledocholithiasis with stenotic papillitis. Conservative therapy (fresh frozen plasma, local hemostats) was used in this patient. In 4 patients with choledocholithiasis, transitory hyperamylasemia was observed, with no clinical symptoms of pancreatitis. The symptoms disappeared with conservative therapy 3 days after the beginning of treatment.Simultaneous laparoscopic cholecystectomy and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography for treatment of cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis is a safe and acceptable treatment.
