Interleukin 10 reduces the incidence of pancreatitis after therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Prophylactic administration of interleukin (IL)-10 decreases the severity of experimental pancreatitis. Prevention of post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis in humans is a unique model to study the potential role of IL-10 in this setting.In a single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, the effect of a single injection of 4 microg/kg (group 1) or 20 microg/kg (group 2) IL-10 was compared with that of placebo (group 0), all administered 30 minutes before therapeutic ERCP. The primary endpoint was the effect of IL-10 on serum levels of amylases and lipases measured 4, 24, and 48 hours after ERCP. The secondary objective was to evaluate changes in plasma cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor) at the same time points and the incidence of acute pancreatitis in the 3 groups. Subjects undergoing a first therapeutic ERCP were eligible for inclusion.A total of 144 patients were included. Seven were excluded based on intention to treat (n = 1) or per protocol (n = 6). Forty-five, 48, and 44 patients remained in groups 0, 1, and 2, respectively. The 3 groups were comparable for age, sex, underlying disease, indication for treatment, type of treatment, and plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), cytokines, and hydrolases at baseline. No significant difference was observed in CRP, cytokine, and hydrolase plasma levels after ERCP. Forty-three patients developed hyperhydrolasemia (18 in group 0, 14 in group 1, and 11 in group 2 P = 0.297), and 19 patients developed acute clinical pancreatitis (11 in group 0, 5 in group 1, 3 in group 2A single intravenous dose of IL-10, given 30 minutes before the start of the procedure, independently reduces the incidence of post-therapeutic ERCP pancreatitis.
