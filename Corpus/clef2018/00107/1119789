How should the common bile duct be explored? An attempt has been made to find which of 3 operations currently in use for exploring the bile ducts gave the best clinical results. For this purpose 3 series of consecutive patients treated at The London Hospital over a 12-year period have been studied retrospectively. The operations used were as follows: (1) conventional supraduodenal choledochotomy (2) transduodenal biliary sphincterotomy
