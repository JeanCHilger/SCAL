Acute pancreatitis in parrots. Acute pancreatitis was diagnosed in three parrots. Antemortem diagnosis of pancreatitis in the avian patient is rarely documented, and should be suspected in birds showing clinical signs attributable to abdominal pain or gastro-intestinal dysfunction. However, not all birds with confirmed pancreatitis display these signs. A serum amylase level greater than 1,500 U/L is suggestive of pancreatitis and pancreatic biopsy can be used to confirm a diagnosis. The aetiology of acute pancreatitis in parrots is discussed and a suggested treatment protocol is described.
