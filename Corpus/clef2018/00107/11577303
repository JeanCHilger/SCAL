Serum lipase, C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6 levels in ERCP-induced pancreatitis. C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are elevated in acute pancreatitis. Limited studies have evaluated their role in ERCP-induced pancreatitis. The aim of this study was to assess the role of serum lipase, CRP, and IL-6 in ERCP-induced pancreatitis.Eighty-five patients (62 women, 23 men mean age 43 yearsMild, moderate, and severe pancreatitis occurred, respectively, in 9, 7, and 4 patients after ERCP. There were significant differences in levels of CRP and IL-6 but not lipase for patients with mild versus moderate and moderate versus severe pancreatitis. The mean CRP levels (mg/dL) at 12 to 24 hours were 0.98 +/- 0.24 in mild pancreatitis, 3.89 +/- 0.32 in moderate pancreatitis, and 12.0 +/- 1.60 in severe pancreatitis. The levels, respectively, at 36 to 48 hours were 1.60 +/- 0.31, 7.60 +/- 0.74, and 25.0 +/- 2.9. The mean IL-6 levels (pg/mL) at 12 to 24 hours were 16.6 +/- 2.06 in mild pancreatitis, 73.0 +/- 15.60 in moderate pancreatitis, and 235.5 +/- 26.31 in severe pancreatitis. The levels at 36 to 48 hours were, respectively, 18.92 +/- 3.28, 100.17 +/- 11.56, and 438.2 +/- 71.50.Serum CRP and IL-6 levels may be useful early markers for predicting the severity of ERCP-induced pancreatitis.
