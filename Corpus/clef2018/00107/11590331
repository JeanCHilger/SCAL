Continuous enteral feeding has an attenuating effect on the exocrine pancreas in rats. Recent clinical observations suggest that continuous enteral feeding (CEF) may exert a beneficial effect in the management of inflammatory pancreatic diseases. Its effects on the exocrine pancreas, however, remain only partially investigated.To examine the effects of CEF on the exocrine pancreas in rats.Eight male Wistar rats were intrajejunally cannulated, and CEF was started on postoperative day 6. In 10 control animals, laparotomy was followed by intragastric feeding (GF) with the same nutriment (Osmolite, Abbott) from postoperative day 6. The daily discharge was 24 kcal in both groups. After 5 days of feeding, the pancreas was removed its weight and its protein, DNA, trypsin, and lipase contents were determinedThe results revealed no significant difference in body weight loss between the two groups of animals, whereas the pancreas weight/body weight ratio was lower (p < 0.01) in the CEF group. The pancreatic protein, DNA, and enzyme contents were decreased (p < 0.01) after CEF as compared with the values for the GF group. Histologic examinations demonstrated clear decreases in acinar size and in the zymogen content of the pancreas in the CEF animals.This study clearly indicates that CEF reduces the enzyme production of the pancreas.
