Immunoglobulin A secretion into pancreatic juice as a novel marker of local immune defense and exocrine pancreatic function. The importance of secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA) of local immune defense in the gastrointestinal tract has gained increasing acceptance. Bacterial contamination is a major factor related to mortality in acute pancreatitis. However, very little is known about IgA in pancreatic juice. Pure pancreatic juice was collected from 40 patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy. The patients were divided into three groups according to the degree of preoperative pancreatic duct obstruction, as follows: normal, narrowed, and obstructed. IgA concentration, amylase activity, and daily volume of pancreatic juice were measured. Daily IgA secretion into pancreatic juice was constant during the early period after the operation. The concentration of IgA in the control group was 5 +/- 0.8 microg/ml, and IgA daily secretion was 1.2 +/- 0.2 mg/day. Pancreatic duct obstruction resulted in a marked decrease in both amylase and pancreatic juice secretion. The concentration of IgA, however, was markedly increased in the narrowed group (11.1 +/- 2.4 microg/ml) and the obstructed group (32.5 +/- 5.4 microg/ml). The concentration of amylase increased with the increase in pancreatic juice. Conversely, the concentration of IgA increased with the decrease in volume of pancreatic juice. Similarly, the increased in IgA concentrations positively correlated with the decrease in amylase activity. In conclusion, the mechanisms that modulate IgA secretion in the human pancreas are essentially different from those that modulate digestive enzyme and fluid secretion. IgA in pancreatic juice may play an important role in pathological conditions such as pancreatic duct obstruction. As such, the measurement of IgA in pancreatic juice may potentially be used as a new marker of local immune defense and exocrine pancreatic function.
