Procalcitonin rapid test in surgical patients treated in the intensive care unit. Procalcitonin test (PCT) has been proposed to check severity of generalized infections or sepsis. The authors measured the PCT values with PCT-Q quick test (BRAHMS DIAGNOSTICA GmbH, Berlin) at 14 surgical patients treated in their intensive care unit (7 sepsis, 4 peritonitis, 2 localized pancreatic abscess, 1 postoperative fever). At 3 septic patients (2 pancreatitis, 1 intestinal necrosis) they measured the PCT levels repeatedly during treatment. In 2 patients with localized pancreatic abscess and in 1 patient with postoperative fever without evidence of infection the PCT levels were low (< 0.5 ng/ml). At 4 patients with peritonitis following gastric or colon perforation the PCT levels were highly elevated (> 10 ng/ml). At 7 patients with severe sepsis the PCT values were high (> 2 ng/ml), except for 1 patient with intestinal necrosis. At this patient the PCT levels were repeatedly low. In 2 septic patients with pancreatitis elevated PCT levels indicated the need for surgery. In most patients PCT was a good indicator of generalized infections. PCT levels measured repeatedly in sepsis were lower than in patients with peritonitis.
