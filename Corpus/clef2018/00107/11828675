Persantine improves acute pancreatitis in vitro. Persantine combined with TNF-a enhances antiproliferative activity in human tumor cells. We hypothesized that the vasodilator persantine would ameliorate acute pancreatitis (AP) in vitro. Rat pancreatic ductal cells were cultured using standard techniques. Acute pancreatitis was induced by adding cerulein (10(-9) M) or TNF-a (200 ng/ml). AP was verified by increased amylase production. Persantine was added at concentrations from 0.1 uM to 100 uM post cerulein or TNF-a treatment. Statistical analysis was achieved by ANOVA. Amylase production was significantly increased (p < 0.05) compared with control upon stimulation with either cerulein or TNF-a. When persantine was added in graded concentrations from 0.1 uM to 100 uM to cerulein treated cells, it decreased amylase production significantly (p < 0.05) at 100 uM. However, when persantine was added to TNF-a treated cells, it decreased amylase production (p < 0.05) at the lower concentrations of 0.1 uM and 1 uM. We have shown for the first time that AP, resulting from either mild (cerulein) or severe (TNF-a) stimulation, is significantly improved by treatment with persantine.
