Pathological evaluation, clinical chemistry and plasma cholecystokinin in neonatal and young miniature swine fed soy trypsin inhibitor from 1 to 39 weeks of age. The potential toxicity of dietary soy trypsin inhibitor (TI) was evaluated in neonatal miniature swine. From 1 to 6 weeks of age, two groups of male piglets were artificially reared in an Autosow and automatically fed either TI or control liquid diet. From 6 to 39 weeks of age, these two groups were fed either TI or control chow diet. A third group, sow control (SC), suckled from birth to 6 weeks of age, were also weaned to control chow from 6 to 39 weeks of age. Clinical chemistry and plasma cholecystokinin (CCK) determined at 6, 18, 30 and 39 weeks of age, and serum amylase activity with gross and histopathological analyses of major organs at 6 and 39 weeks of age are reported. TI had no effect on plasma CCK, serum amylase activity, or numerous clinical chemistry values. TI-fed piglets had a larger relative liver weight at 6 weeks of age. Relative pancreas weight decreased with age but was not affected by TI. Gross and histopathological analyses of major organs, except the spleen, were within normal limits. Increased incidence of extramedullary hematopoiesis was noted in the spleen of the TI group at 6 but not at 39 weeks of age. There was no consistent pattern in immunohistochemical foci for secretin, gastrin releasing polypeptide or CCK, and no change in DNA, RNA, mitotic index or nuclear density of pancreatic cells. At 6 weeks of age, TI increased pancreatic protein and amylase activity but not trypsin or chymotrypsin activity. None of the effects suggested that this dose of TI was toxic to either the neonatal or sexually mature miniature male swine.
