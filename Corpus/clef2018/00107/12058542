Pancreatic enzyme activity in early phases of acute experimental pancreatitis in rats. Experiments were performed on laboratory rats with acute pancreatitis caused by local freezing the pancreas with chlorethyl. An active action of enzymes alpha-amilase, lipase, phospholipase A2, was revealed. During the first hours, an increase in action of all three enzymes, particularly that of phospholipase A2, was found. It was established that the lipid spectrum of pancreas had changed. It shows that cell membranes were destroyed. Experiments revealed an activating role of Ca2+ ions for all the enzymes and a correcting action of chlorpromasine.
