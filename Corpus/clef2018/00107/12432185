What are the predictors of post-ERCP pancreatitis, and how useful are they? Acute pancreatitis is one of the major complications of ERCP. It is of paramount importance that we accurately identify which patients will go on to develop post-ERCP pancreatitis. As most ERCPs are performed on an outpatient basis, early evaluation can allow safe discharge of the majority of patients who will not develop post-ERCP pancreatitis or develop only mild symptoms that will be self-limited. Alternatively, early detection of those patients who will go on to develop moderate or severe post-ERCP pancreatitis can guide decisions regarding hospital admission and aggressive management and can help direct the use of targeted therapies that have the potential to prevent or mitigate pancreatic inflammation. Thus, significant efforts have focused on trying to identify predictors of post-ERCP pancreatitis. These parameters can be organized into three categories of tests: 1) pancreatic enzymes as markers of pancreatic injury: serum amylase/urine amylase 2) markers of proteolytic activation: trypsinogen, trypsinogen activation peptide
