Usefulness of examination of the cholesterol versus triglyceride ratio for lipoprotein fractions in a patient with marked hyper-triglyceridemia. A patient consulted the emergency room with acute pancreatitis, hypertriglyceridemia, and diabetes mellitus, and was later admitted to the hospital. Serum levels of total cholesterol(TC) and total triglyceride (TTG), and the cholesterol(Chol) versus triglyceride(TG) ratio(Chol/TG) for lipoprotein fractions were examined periodically during the course of treatment using Chol/Trig Combo, which identifies Chol and TG by differential staining. On admission, the patient's TTG, pancreatic amylase and glucose levels were 4020 mg/dl, 2012 IU/l, and 242 mg/dl, respectively. Clinofibrate administration resulted in a decrease in Chol and TG values for all fractions. However, the Chol/TG ratios were unchanged(HDL of 0.2 to 0.4, VLDL of approximately 0.13, and LDL of 0.1 to 0.2: Reference values from 103 healthy students were as follows: HDL 5.8 +/- 2.0, VLDL 0.39 +/- 0.1, and LDL 4.9 +/- 1.3[Mean +/- SD].). During clinofibrate treatment, TC and TG values gradually increased. Clinofibrate was discontinued and fenofibrate administration was initiated. This was followed by a dramatic improvement in TC, TTG and Chol/TG values for both HDL and LDL. The monitoring of lipoprotein fraction values proved useful for determining the treatment regimen for this patient with hypertriglyceridemia.
