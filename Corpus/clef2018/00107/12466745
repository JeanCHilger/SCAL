EUS-guided pancreatic pseudocyst drainage: review and experience at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. Pancreatic pseudocyst, the most common cystic lesion of the pancreas, is a localized collection of fluid rich in amylase within or adjacent to the pancreas and enclosed by a nonepithelialized wall, occurring as a result of acute or chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic trauma, or pancreatic duct obstruction. Currently, at least 3 major forms of therapy are available: percutaneous drainage, surgical intervention, and endoscopic drainage. Controversy exists concerning which of these techniques should be offered to the patient as initial therapy. Three options exist for the surgical management of pancreatic pseudocysts: excision, external drainage, and internal drainage. Surgery, which traditionally was the major treatment approach for pancreatic pseudocysts, has been challenged by newer endoscopic techniques. Given the low complication and mortality rates and the high success rate of endoscopic drainage when compared with surgery, surgical intervention should be reserved only for certain cases. Addition of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) for endoscopic drainage is a new and exciting development and may decrease the risks associated with endoscopic drainage. We report our experience of 14 cases of EUS-guided pancreatic pseudocyst drainage and review the literature for advantages and disadvantages of these pancreatic pseudocyst drainage procedures. Complications, recurrence, success, and mortality rates for each procedure are described. Our approach to pancreatic pseudocyst management is described in the form of an algorithm.
