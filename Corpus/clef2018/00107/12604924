Spirits and gastrectomy increase risk for chronic pancreatitis in Japanese male alcoholics. Most cases of chronic pancreatitis are alcohol-related, but not all alcoholics develop pancreatitis.To elucidate historical and biologic risk factors for this disease.Alcoholic Japanese men (n = 132) consecutively admitted to the National Alcoholism Center over 24 months, including 54 with chronic pancreatitis (diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) and 78 without, were surveyed about drinking history, smoking, education, and marital status, and tested for amylase, glycosylated hemoglobin, body mass, alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenase genotypes, and K-ras gene mutations in pancreatic juice.Higher risk for chronic pancreatitis was associated with drinking spirits rather than lower-alcohol beverages (odds ratio [OR], 2.58 p= 0.01). Daily ethanol consumption by those who drank spirits was greater than that among those who drank lower-alcohol beveragesOur study strongly suggested that spirits and partial gastrectomy increase the risk for chronic pancreatitis in male alcoholics.
