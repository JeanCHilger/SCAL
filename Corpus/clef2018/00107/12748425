Oxygen radicals promote ICAM-1 expression and microcirculatory disturbances in experimental acute pancreatitis. The course of pancreatitis is paralleled by a drastic reduction in organ perfusion and increased ICAM-1-mediated leukocyte-endothelial interaction. We aimed to evaluate the effect of oxygen radicals on ICAM-1 expression and the microcirculation in severe acute pancreatitis using the oxygen radical scavenger dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO).Severe pancreatitis was induced in rats (n = 32) who were randomly assigned to one of two groups: either 4 ml/kg 50% DMSO/saline (v/v) started 3 h after induction of pancreatitis or 4 ml/kg saline (control). Microcirculation was evaluated by intermittent intravital microscopy. Serum amylase and lipase, histomorphometric changes, immunohistochemistry for ICAM-1 expression and 24-hour survival were investigated.Leukocyte adherence was significantly reduced (4.4 +/- 0.47 vs. 5.58 +/- 0.69 sticker/100 micro m, p < 0.05), and mean capillary (0.96 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.45 +/- 0.13 mm/s p < 0.01) and venous erythrocyte velocity (1.16 +/- 0.12 vs. 0.58 +/- 0.16 mm/s, p < 0.01) were significantly increased by DMSO treatment. Microcirculatory disturbances were paralleled by an increase in endothelial ICAM-1 expression, whereas DMSO reduced ICAM-1 expression.DMSO improves pancreatic microcirculation and reduces ICAM-1 expression and subsequent leukocyte adhesion, suggesting an important role of oxygen free radicals in the pathway of endothelial ICAM-1 expression and microcirculatory disturbances in acute pancreatitis.
