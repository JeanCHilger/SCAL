Metabolic syndrome and pancreas. Status of exocrine and incretory function of the pancreas in various types of hyperlipoproteinemia in patients with metabolic syndrome. We studied the frequency of the main types of hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP) by Fredrickson (1971) and the functional state of the pancreas in 53 patients with metabolic syndromes without any clinical signs of the digestive apparatus pathology and pancreatic diabetes. It was established that IIb [symbol: see text] IV types of the disease were observed in 26 and 13 cases (49 and 24.5%, respectively), type IIa was recorded in 9 cases (17%), and type V was recorded in 5 patients (9.5% of all cases). Functional pancreas disorders were recorded more often in cases of HLP of IIa, IV and V types. Excretory disorders were characterized mainly by insufficient production of lipase, bicarbonates and the liquid secretion fraction, while insular disorders were characterized by apparent disorders of glucose tolerance and pre-clinical pancreatic diabetes of type II.
