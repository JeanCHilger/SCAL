Effect of chronic ethanol feeding on factors leading to inappropriate intrapancreatic activation of zymogens in the rat pancreas. In rats fed control and ethanol-containing Lieber-DeCarli diets for a period of 12 months, the bile did not contain any enterokinase, the pancreatic juice did not contain any plasmin or thrombin, but in animals fed high fat diet with ethanol, trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen were significantly increased and trypsin inhibitor decreased. In the tissue, free trypsin and cathepsin B were increased. Composite profile of trypsinogen in gel segments obtained from the pancreatic juice and the tissue showed higher peaks of cationic and anionic variants of trypsinogen in animals fed ethanol. There was no evidence of mesotrypsinogen or of enzyme Y in the juice or the tissue. These studies show that serine proteases and cathepsin B may play a major role in the pathobiology of alcoholic pancreatitis.
