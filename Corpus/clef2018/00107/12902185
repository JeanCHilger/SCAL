Transcutaneous ultrasound-guided pancreatic biopsy in cattle and its safety: a preliminary report. This study describes a free-hand technique for percutaneous pancreatic biopsy in cattle with ultrasound-guidance using a 14G spinal biopsy needle. Its safety was evaluated based on 36 consecutive procedures. To assess the immediate effects of pancreatic biopsy, 31 cows were necropsied shortly after the procedure and examined. The remaining five cows were examined daily for eight days and then necropsied and examined. No life-threatening complications nor clinically detectable abnormalities were observed. Changes indicative of inflammation were not apparent in total and differential WBC counts or in total protein and fibrinogen concentrations. A small increase of amylase activity was detected in only one cow kept for the eight-day observation period. Serum lipase activity increased significantly on day four after biopsy. Urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose and the activities of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyltransferase remained within reference ranges. Changes in the peritoneum and pancreas observed at necropsy were negligible. We conclude that percutaneous ultrasound-guided pancreatic biopsy did not appear to influence the cow's condition adversely and the procedure provided an excellent method of obtaining a pancreatic specimen for histological examination. The procedure was considered safe, fast, cost-effective, and practical when performed properly. We believe that the technique can be used in cows with suspected pancreatic disease for making an ante mortem diagnosis.
