Prediction of peritoneal fluid pancreatic amylase to histopathological change and prognosis of acute experimental necrotic pancreatitis of monkey. To observe the significance of peritoneal fluid pancreatic amylase in predicting the degree of histopathological change and prognosis of acute necrotic pancreatitis (ANP) of monkey.Injection of the mixture of bile and trypsin into the pancreatic duct set up ANP monkey model.The severity of ANP depended on the injection rate and volume, in correlation to the peritoneal fluid pancreatic amylase (PF Amylase) in the early stage of ANP. With the rate (3-13 ml/min) and volume (0.1-1.0 ml/kg) of injection increase, the PF Amylase in the early stage of the ANP significantly went up. Meanwhile, the survival time was negatively correlated to the PF Amylase in the early stage (0.5 hour) of ANP (t = -9.06 InX + 129.85, r = -0.88, P < 0.01).The PF Amylase in the early stage of ANP can effectively predict the severity of ANP and prognosis.
