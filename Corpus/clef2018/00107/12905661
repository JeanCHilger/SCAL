A mouse model of severe acute pancreatitis induced by caerulein plus lipopolysaccharide. To set up a convenient nontraumatic mouse model of severe acute pancreatitis(SAP).Mice received intraperitoneal injections with caerulein and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Serum amylase and pancreatic moisture content were measured during experiment. The histo pathological changes of pancreas and relevant organs were observed under light microscope.Serum amylase and pancreatic moisture content increased and pancreatic interstitial edema, inflammatory cellular infiltration, parenchymal necrosis as well as parenchymal hemorrhages were happened in the caerulein plus LPS group, and the lesions of other organs including stomach, ileum, spleen, and lung were seen as well. In the careulein group, there was only pancreatic interstitial edema with no parenchmal necrosis or hemorrhage, and the rest organs were normal.The SAP mouse model induced by caerulein plus LPS has the same pathological characteristics of human SAP, which can be used for human SAP studies.
