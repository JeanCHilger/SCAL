A rare initial manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus--acute pancreatitis: case report and review of the literature. Acute pancreatitis as the initial manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has been documented only nine times in the English literature.We report the case of a 25-year-old woman patient with fever, abdominal pain and vomiting, elevated levels of pancreatic enzymes, and various other laboratory abnormalities. Further investigation led to a diagnosis of SLE. A literature search, using the key words "systemic lupus erythematosus" and "pancreatitis" was undertaken.The treatment of SLE pancreatitis is steroids, which is somewhat controversial because steroids have been implicated in the cause. SLE can involve any organ system. It is important that the family physician, who treats patients as a whole, rules out SLE when a straightforward diagnosis is associated with inexplicable multiple concomitant abnormalities.
