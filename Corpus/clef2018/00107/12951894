Acute pancreatitis occurring in the early postpartum period: a case report. We report a case of acute pancreatitis, which occurred after delivery in a woman who had an uneventful course of pregnancy and parturition. A 17-year-old Japanese woman was referred to our department because of nausea and vomiting two hours after delivery, followed by severe abdominal and back pain. On admission, in addition to elevated serum and urine amylase, plain computed tomography demonstrated a swollen pancreas and high density in the peripancreatic lesion with a large amount of ascites, suggesting the presence of an inflammation of the pancreas as well as peripancreatic lesion. Accompanied by subsiding abdominal and back pain, serum amylase concentration gradually decreased and returned to a normal level on the 11th postpartum day. Acute pancreatitis must be kept in mind when evaluating patients presenting with abdominal pain after delivery.
