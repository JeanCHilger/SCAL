Peptide YY exhibits a mitogenic effect on pancreatic cells while improving acute pancreatitis in vitro. Peptide YY (PYY), a gastrointestinal regulatory peptide, improves survival and histologic parameters in animal models of acute pancreatitis. Its effects on pancreatic cell growth and acute pancreatitis in pancreatic acinar and ductal cells are unknown. We hypothesized that PYY would affect cell growth and attenuate acute pancreatitis in pancreatic acinar and ductal cells in vitro.Rat pancreatic acinar and ductal cells were cultured in the presence of 1) cerulein, a synthetic cholecystokinin analog that induces pancreatitis, 2) PYY, or 3) a combination group pretreated with PYY prior to addition of cerulein. Cell survival was measured at 48 h using MTT assay. Amylase secretion, as marker for pancreatitis, was measured at 48 h using an amylase activity assay. Statistical significance was calculated using analysis of variance and the Student's t test.Peptide yy significantly increased cell growth and decreased amylase secretion compared with control and cerulein groups. Pretreatment with PYY significantly protected against the pancreatitis effects of cerulein.We have shown for the first time that PYY has a mitogenic effect on pancreatic acinar and ductal cells in vitro. In addition, it directly protects against cerulein-induced pancreatitis. Its potential therapeutic benefit in acute pancreatitis would therefore be twofold: amelioration of the inflammatory process, and augmenting growth of normal pancreas to replace necrotic or apoptotic cell loss.
