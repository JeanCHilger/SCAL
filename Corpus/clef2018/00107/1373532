The importance of a colloid in canine pancreas preservation. The role of hydroxyethyl starch (HES), the colloid component of the UW solution, was tested in canine pancreas preservation. Segmental pancreatic autografts were preserved for 48 hr cold storage with UW solution with HES (group 1) or UW solution without HES (group 2). After preservation, the pancreas was transplanted, and survival, serum glucose, serum amylase, intravenous glucose tolerance tests, tissue water content, and histology were compared between groups. In group 1 (with HES), 9/10 dogs were long-term survivors with one dog dying due to causes unrelated to preservation failure. In group 2 (without HES), 3/6 dogs died due to graft loss within one week posttransplant (P = 0.01). No graft failure occurred in group 1 (0/9) versus graft loss in 4/6 dogs in group 2 (P = 0.04). All animals in group 1 (with HES) showed normal serum glucose and amylase concentrations postoperatively, normal tissue water values after preservation, k values comparable to those observed after segmental autotransplantation without preservation, and relatively good histology. In group 2 (without HES), in 4/6 dogs graft failure occurred that led to the death (3 dogs) of the animals or to a diabetic state (1 dog). After 48-hr cold storage without HES, a significant increase in tissue water content, glucose and amylase levels was seen. After transplantation, hyperglycemia, hyperamylasemia, and clinical diabetes were observed in 4/6 dogs. Autopsy and histological evaluation showed evidence of thrombosis and ischemic insult. Two of 6 dogs in group 2 remained normoglycemic during follow-up with borderline k values. The results suggested that for consistently successful 48-hr preservation of the pancreas, HES is an important component of the UW solution. Although a colloid may not be essential for short-term preservation of kidney and liver, it appears to be an important factor in successful pancreas preservation.
