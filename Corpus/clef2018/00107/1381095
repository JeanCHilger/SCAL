Endogenous cholecystokinin, the major factor responsible for dietary protein-induced pancreatic growth. This study was undertaken to clarify the role of endogenous cholecystokinin (CCK) in induction of pancreatic growth stimulated by a high protein diet. Rats with i.v. jugular cannulae in place and kept in Bollman cages were adapted to 5% casein diet for 9 days and switched to 70% casein for 2 days. MK-329, a CCK receptor antagonist, and SMS 201-995, a somatostatin agonist, were continuously infused at 0.5 mg/kg/h and 5 micrograms/kg/h, respectively, starting at the onset of feeding 70% casein. The 5 and 70% casein control groups were infused with saline. Feeding 70% casein significantly stimulated pancreatic hyperplasia and tissue hypertrophy. MK-329 and SMS 201-995 totally prevented 70% casein-induced increases in pancreatic weight and total RNA and DNA contents. The results indicate that endogenous CCK is the major factor responsible for pancreatic growth induced by a high protein diet.
