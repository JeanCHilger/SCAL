Effects of elevated zinc intake on the copper metabolism and the pancreas of the mouse. The effects of moderately elevated zinc (Zn) intake on copper (Cu) metabolism and on the pancreas were studied. Zn (80 mg/L) as acetate was added to the drinking water of male Swiss mice for up to 12 weeks, which increased the total daily Zn intake to about 5 times the adequate level. Total Cu and Zn in tissues was measured by atomic absorption spectrometry. 64Cu was used to measure some effects of the Zn suppletion on the Cu metabolism. Furthermore, ceruloplasmin and amylase in plasma and superoxide dismutase in erythrocytes were measured. The pancreas was examined by light microscopy. The Zn supplementation decreased the 64Cu absorption and increased the retention of 64Cu, but did not lead to a Cu deficiency. Microscopic examination of the pancreas revealed focal hypertrophy of acinar cells, occasionally accompanied by vacuolation of cytoplasm and/or the presence of degenerated cells. The results, obtained in mice given a moderately increased Zn intake, should be interpreted as a warning against the chronic use in man of high doses of Zn for non-medical purposes.
