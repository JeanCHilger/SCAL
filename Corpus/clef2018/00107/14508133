Depletion of serum L-arginine in patients with acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis may be initiated by interference with the pancreatic outflow to the duodenum. This flow is normally regulated by reflex relaxation of the sphincter of Oddi in which nitric oxide is an important mediator.To test the hypothesis that acute pancreatitis involves a depletion in serum L-arginine resulting in impaired production of nitric oxide.We measured serum L-arginine and L-citrulline and urinary nitrite/nitrate concentrations 1 to 3 days after the onset of symptoms in 11 patients with gallstone pancreatitis, 10 patients with alcoholic pancreatitis, and 6 patients with idiopathic pancreatitis. We compared their results with those from control groups of 13 healthy blood donors, 9 patients fasting before hernia operations, 8 patients with acute cholecystitis, and 9 alcoholic subjects but no pancreatitis. Serum arginine and citrulline concentrations were measured with high performance liquid chromatography, and urinary nitrite/nitrate spectrophotometrically.Patients with acute pancreatitis, of whatever cause, had lower serum L-arginine and L-citrulline concentrations than controls. Patients with gallstone and idiopathic pancreatitis also have reduced urinary concentrations of nitrite and nitrate but this was not seen in patients with alcoholic pancreatitis.L-arginine and L-citrulline concentrations are depleted in the serum of patients with acute pancreatitis. Reduced urinary nitrite and nitrate in gallstone pancreatitis indicate that there is a defect formation of nitric oxide. This may cause a functional obstruction of the outflow of pancreatic juice to the duodenum and so may be involved in the pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis.
