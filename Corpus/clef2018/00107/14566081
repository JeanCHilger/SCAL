Poly-C specific ribonuclease activity correlates with increased concentrations of IL-6, IL-8 and sTNFR55/sTNFR75 in plasma of patients with acute pancreatitis. Plasma pancreatic-type Poly-C specific ribonuclease (P-RNase)-enzyme activity increases in patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) who develop pancreatic necrosis and severe disease course. It is considered as a marker of pancreatic tissue destruction. The aim of this study was to estimate interrelations between major inflammatory cytokines such as: interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor soluble receptors: sTNFR55 and sTNFR75 output, and plasma P-RNase activity. The study was carried out in a group of 56 patients with AP, where 20 developed pancreatic necrosis. It was found that serum P-RNase concentration and levels of all studied inflammatory cytokines significantly increase already in the first day from diagnose of the disease (2.5 folds for P-RNase, 20 for IL-8, about 200 for IL-6 and 1.5 for receptors, respectively). In the first day from admission to hospital, P-RNase activity significantly correlated with plasma concentration of studied inflammatory cytokines. The most pronounced correlation was found for P-RNase and IL-6 in days 1-4 from diagnose, manifested by Pearson correlation r coefficients amounting to 0.86, 0.79, 0.60 and 0.57 respectively (p<0.001). Dividing the studied AP patients into two groups, varying in severity of disease a significant differences in P-RNase and IL-6, IL-8 and sTNFR55/sTNFR75 were found. In patients with acute necrotizing pancreatitis P-RNase significantly correlate with levels of major inflammatory cytokines. Carried out studies suggest that activity of P-RNase reflects severity of inflammatory reaction, which is dependent on development of pancreatic injury and tissue necrosis in AP.
