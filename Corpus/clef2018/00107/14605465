Carcinoma of the pancreas with neuroendocrine differentiation and nodular panniculitis. On rare occasions tumours of the pancreas produce high amounts of pancreatic lipase. The enzyme activity in the blood and in different tissues causes a syndrome called nodular panniculitis by focal necrosis of lipids and a concomittant inflammatory reaction.A 72-year-old man was admitted to the dermatology clinic with the diagnosis of erythema nodosum. The patient had been well until 3 months earlier when painful red nodes developed on the skin of both shanks. He complained of profuse night sweating and a weight loss of 10 kg within that time but did not have fever. He also had noticed a painful swelling of his right index finger, left middle finger and the third toe on his left foot. Biopsy of the nodes revealed a focal necrosis of fatty tissue. Laboratory examinations showed a highly elevated concentration of serum pancreatic lipase. Further investigations showed a tumour in the pancreas and several osteolytic lesions. Tumour biopsy revealed a neuroendocrine carcinoma. After tumour resection serum lipase level immediately fell to almost normal values, and all skin and bone manifestations disappeared quickly.Due to its clinical appearance the panniculitis syndrome is most often mistaken for either erythema nodosum or rheumatoid arthritis. A resection of the tumour after correct diagnosis should always be considered because the widespread manifestations in the skin and bones do not represent distant metastasis and have a very good chance to dissolve completely.
