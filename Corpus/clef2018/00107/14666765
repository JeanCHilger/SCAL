Therapeutic effect of qingyi decoction and tetrandrine in treating severe acute pancreatitis in miniature pigs and serum drug level determination. To investigate the therapeutic effect of Qingyi Decoction (QYD) and tetrandrine (Tet), used singly or combind, in treating miniature pigs with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) and its mechanism.Thirty-two Guizhou miniature pigs were made into SAP model by pancreatic duct retrograde injection of 5% sodium taurocholate. They were randomly divided into 4 groups: the control group, the QYD group, the Tet group and the combined treated group. The serum amylase activity and interleukin-1 and 6 (IL-1, IL-6) contents in serum from vena cava and portal vein were tested by biochemistry and radioimmunoassay (RIA). Serum emodin and plasma Tet levels were measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) 24, 48 and 72 hrs after treatment. And the pathological changes of pancreas, lung and liver were observed under microscope.The mortality of SAP pigs was reduced significantly and the inflammatory injury of the organs was ameliorated obviously in all treated groups, and the increased amylase activity and IL-1, IL-6 levels was attenuated. The therapeutic effect was much more obvious, and the plasma Tet level at different time points were much higher in the combined treated group than those in the other two groups treated by single drug (P < 0.01).Both QYD and Tet could treat effectively SAP through multiple pathways, combination of them reveals an elevation of serum drug concentration and shows a synergistic effect.
