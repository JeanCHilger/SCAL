Comparison of sensitivity and specificity of serum poly-C avid ribonuclease activity and C-reactive protein concentration in detection of mild and severe acute pancreatitis. The aim of this study was to compare diagnostic performance of C-reactive protein (CRP) and poly-C avid ribonuclease (P-RNase) levels in the prediction of a severe clinical course of acute pancreatitis (AP). The study included 36 patients with mild and 20 with severe AP. CRP concentration was measured by an immunonephelometric method and P-RNase activity by the rate of polycytidylate hydrolysis at pH 7.8. At the time of admission, both P-RNase and CRP levels were significantly increased in all patients when compared to healthy subjects (29.2 vs. 18.7 U/l and 91.1 vs. 2.89 mg/l p < 0.001). Up to days 3 and 4 a further increase in P-RNase was observed. On the other hand, the increase in CRP continued only through days 2 and 3 (p < 0.001). Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) and mild acute pancreatitis (MAP) differed significantly with respect to P-RNase levels on all days studied
