Usefulness of urinary trypsinogen-2 dipstick test for diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. The clinical usefulness of urinary trypsinogen-2 dipstick test is still in controversy. We evaluated the usefulness of urinary trypsinogen-2 dipstick test in patients with acute pancreatitis.Urinary trypsinogen-2 dipstick test was prospectively performed in 50 patients with acute pancreatitis, 50 patients with non-pancreatic abdominal pain, and 50 healthy controls.On admission, urinary trypsinogen-2 dipstick test was positive in 36 of 50 patients with acute pancreatitis (sensitivity, 72%) and in 4 of 50 patients with non-pancreatic abdominal pain (specificity, 92%). On the other hand, it was all negative in controls. The sensitivity and specificity of serum lipase were 78% and 94%, respectively. At 24 hours after admission, the positive rate of urinary trypsinogen-2 dipstick test rose from 72% to 94% (p=0.02). The results of urinary trypsinogen-2 dipstick test was positive in 14 of 15 patients with severe pancreatitis and 22 of 35 patients with mild pancreatitis according to the criteria by Atlanta International Symposium, 1992.Urinary trypsinogen-2 dipstick test is comparable to serum lipase in diagnosing acute pancreatitis. Delayed measurement and severe pancreatitis are more likely to yield positive results with urinary trypsinogen-2 dipstick test. Thus, we suggest that the cut-off value of urinary trypsinogen-2 dipstick test should be lowered to increase its sensitivity.
