Protective and therapeutic effect of leptin in acute pancreatitis evoked by ischemia/reperfusion. Leptin is a hormone implicated in the regulation of the food intake and body weight, but also increasing number of evidence suggest that leptin participates in the regulation of inflammatory processes. The aim of our study was to examine the influence of exogenous leptin administration on the development and the course of acute ischemic pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis was induced by temporary limitation of pancreatic blood flow, followed by reperfusion. Leptin was administered three times daily at the dose 10 or 50 micrograms/kg. Studies were terminated at 1, 3, 5, 10 and 21 days after induction of acute pancreatitis. Leptin administration reduced development of pancreatic damage and accelerated pancreatic regeneration. It was manifested by the decrease in serum lipase and amylase activity, the reduction in serum interleukin-1 beta concentration and the improvement of pancreatic histology. Additionally, treatment with leptin caused the increase in the pancreatic blood flow and pancreatic DNA synthesis. Serum interleukin-10 concentration was not effected by leptin administration. Leptin at the dose 50 micrograms/kg was more effective than 10 micrograms/kg. We conclude that leptin is able to limit the pancreatic damage in the course of ischemic pancreatitis and accelerates the pancreatic tissue repair. These effects of leptin seem to be dependent on the increase in pancreatic cell growth, the limitation of pro-inflammatory interleukin-1 beta release and the improvement of pancreatic blood flow.
