Decreased red blood cells deformability in acute pancreatitis in the rat. Effect of tirilazad mesylate. The ability of erythrocytes to deform is the key feature in maintain the microcirculation. Both acute pancreatitis and decrease in deformability of erythrocytes are associated with increase in lipid peroxidation as a result of excess production of free radicals. Hence the aim of this study was to investigate the red blood cell (RBC) deformability and lipid peroxidation product content within erythrocytes in acute pancreatitis in rats.Rats with cerulein induced acute edematous pancreatitis (CR), pancreatitis induced by cerulein and water immersion stress (CR + WIS) and closed duodenal loop pancreatitis (CDL) treated by tirilazad mesylate were sacrificed in 9 th hour of the experiment. Deformability of erythrocytes has been investigated by means of shear stress diffractometry and expressed as elongation index (EI). Histological scoring and serum amylase were used as parameters of acute pancreatitis. Lipid peroxidation products have been assayed in RBC as a malonyldialdehyde. 1. There were no changes in EI of RBC during CR. 2. EI of RBC were impaired at low shear stresses (up to 3.0 Pa) but not in higher shear stresses in CR + WIS. 3. CDL are associated with decreases of elongation indexes in all shear stresses. 4. Tirilazad mesylate prevent decrease in EI of RBC in CR + WIS but not in CDL. 5. A significant increase in MDA content in RBC in CR, CR + WIS, but not in CDL as compared to control rats was observed. 6. Tirilazad mesylate has no effect on MDA content in RBC during experimental acute pancreatitis.1. In experimental acute pancreatitis a decrease in erythrocyte's deformability has been observed. 2. Protective effect of tirilazad mesylate on decrease in RBC deformability in acute pancreatitis induced by cerulein and water immersion stress are not depend on inhibition of lipid peroxidation within erythrocytes.
