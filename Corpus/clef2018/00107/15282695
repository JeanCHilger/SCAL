Pancreatitis causing death in bulimia nervosa. We report the case of a 19-year-old woman with bulimia nervosa who died of acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis. Our objective is to raise awareness that because the symptoms of both conditions are very similar, the pre-existence of an eating disorder should not distract physicians from the possibility that potentially lethal acute pancreatitis may coexist.The study includes autopsy results and a review of the literature.Pancreatitis usually presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.In patients with eating disorders who may already have exhibited these symptoms pancreatitis may not be considered. Elevated serum amylase values may occur in subjects with bulimia nervosa without pancreatitis. If the serum amylase value is elevated, pancreatitis can be confirmed by measuring the levels of serum lipase, trypsinogen, pancreatic isoenzyme of amylase, or by abdominal computerized tomography (CT).
