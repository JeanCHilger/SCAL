The effect of continuous arterial infusion of gabexate mesilate (FOY-007) on experimental acute pancreatitis. The effectiveness of continuous arterial infusion of Gabexate Mesilate (FOY-007) on experimental acute pancreatitis was investigated. Acute necrotizing pancreatitis was induced by an injection of 10% Na-taurocholate (1ml/kg) into the main pancreatic duct of mongrel dogs. Animals were divided into three groups Group A: non-treated control, Group B: after the induction of pancreatitis, injected with FOY-007 intravenously (5mg/kg/hr), Group C: after the induction of pancreatitis, injected with FOY-007 via the celiac artery. The changes in the values of amylase and lipase in serum and ascites etc. were examined. A histological examination was done and the FOY-007 concentration of the pancreas was measured. In both groups B and C, the serum levels of amylase and lipase reached significantly to low levels compared with those in group A. The extents of pancreatic parenchyma necrosis in each group were 36.1, 25.3 and 19.5%, respectively, and were significantly improved in group C. In addition, the FOY-007 levels in pancreas specimens in the intraarterial infusion group exceeded those in the intravenous infusion group by 32 times. The results suggest that continuous FOY-007 arterial infusion therapy is useful as a local treatment for severe acute pancreatitis.
