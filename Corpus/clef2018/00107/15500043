The effect of hepatoprotectors containing phospholipids on rats with experimental acute pancreatitis. The experiments on rats with a model acute pancreatitis showed that hepatoprotectors containing phospholipids (eplir and essentiale) improve the parameters of metabolism and the functions and histological characteristics of the pancreas and liver. Both drugs produced an antioxidant effect, decreased the activity of alpha-amylase, lipase, enzymes of hepatic origin in the blood, and reduced the content of creatinine, glucose, urea, bilirubin, and lipids. The therapeutic action of eplir was more pronounced than that of essentiale.
