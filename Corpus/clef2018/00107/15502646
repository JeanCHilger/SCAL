Serum trypsinogen activation peptide in the assessment of the diagnosis and severity of acute pancreatic damage: a pilot study using a new determination technique. To evaluate the clinical value of a new direct and competitive immunoassay for trypsinogen activation peptide (TAP) determination in acute pancreatitis (AP).The subjects were 34 patients with AP (22 mild, 12 severe), 12 patients with nonpancreatic acute abdominal pain (AA), 11 healthy subjects (HS), and 16 consecutive patients who underwent therapeutic ERCP (ERCP). Serum TAP, amylase, and lipase levels were determined in AP, AA, and HS at their initial observation the AP patients were also studied for 6 consecutive days after admission. In the ERCP patients, serum TAP, amylase, and lipase levels, as well as urine TAP and amylase levels, were determined before and 6 hours after endoscopy.Serum TAP levels on admission were 0.35 +/- 1.60 OD (mean +/- SD) in AP patients and 0.005 +/- 0.001 OD in AA patients, while HS patients had no detectable serum TAP levels. ERCP patients had no detectable serum TAP levels before and 6 hours after the ERCP, whereas urine TAP concentrations were 1.72 +/- 3.43 OD and 0.75 +/- 1.49 OD before and 6 hours after the execution of the endoscopy, respectively (P = 0.249). The sensitivities and specificities of serum TAP, amylase, and lipase levels in discriminating between AP and AA were 23.5% and 91.7%, 94.1% and 100%, and 97.1% and 100%, respectively, while those used in the assessment of the severity of AP were 29.9% and 73.5%, 38.8% and 81.2%, and 28.4% and 83.6%, respectively.TAP is of limited value in assessing the diagnosis and the severity of acute pancreatic damage.
