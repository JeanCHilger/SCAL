Effect of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor on opsonin receptor expression in cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis. Decreased levels of expression of opsonin receptors (CD11b and CD32/16) on peritoneal exudate neutrophils may lead to susceptibility to infection. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) increases the expression levels of CD11b on neutrophils and prolongs neutrophil survival. The effects of G-CSF on neutrophils and opsonin receptor expressions of neutrophils were investigated in cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis.Forty-two mice were randomly assigned to each group (n = 6). Mice received subcutaneous G-CSF (120 microg/kg body weight) before the induction of acute pancreatitis with cerulein. Saline was used for instead of G-CSF or cerulein solution in control groups. CD11b and CD32/16 expression levels on circulatory and peritoneal exudate neutrophils were investigated 6 and 24 hours after the induction of acute pancreatitis.Treatment with G-CSF did not aggravate the inflammation of pancreatic tissue evaluated by plasma amylase, acinar necrosis. However, it significantly increased the number of peritoneal exudate neutrophils (P < 0.05) and the CD11b- (P < 0.05) and CD32/16-positive (P < 0.05) peritoneal exudate neutrophils in mice with cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis. The means of fluorescence intensity for CD11b and CD32/16 expressions on circulatory and peritoneal exudate neutrophils were also elevated in the G-CSF groups.G-CSF administration increases the numbers of neutrophils and improves expression levels of opsonin receptors on neutrophils in mice with cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis.
