Selected biochemical parameters and ultrastructural picture of pancreas due to Ulinastatin treatment of experimental acute pancreatitis. Urinary trypsin inhibitor (UTI, Ulinastatin) is a protease inhibitor that has not been yet used in Europe in any experimental trial of severe acute pancreatitis. We have combined the experimental model of severe, hemorrhagic form of acute pancreatitis, and pharmacological treatment with a protease inhibitor. Male Wistar rats were divided into four experimental groups: healthy controls, operated, operated with experimentally induced acute pancreatitis, and animals with acute pancreatitis--treated with UTI preparations. Subjects in the last group were administered UTI intraperitoneally 1 h after pancreatitis induction in an average standard dose of 3000 units/animal. Additionally, four subgroups were created in this treated group, based on the UTI administration time--number of standard doses received: 2 h - 1 standard dose, 6 h - 5 standard doses, 12 h - 11 doses, 24 and 48 h - 15 doses. Statistically significant differences in the serum amylase and lipase activity between the UTI-treated and non-treated subjects were found. In the group of non-treated animals, there a profound destruction of cellular organelles was observed with a total degradation of nuceli, endoplasmatic reticulum and zymogen granules. However, in the UTI-treated subjects, pathological processes proceeded with the significantly slower pace and in much smaller quantities.
