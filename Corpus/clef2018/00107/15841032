Mild hypothermia protects against sodium taurocholate (NaTc)-induced acute pancreatitis in rats with adverse effects on serum cytokines. To test the effect of mild hypothermia in reducing pancreatic damage and improving the survival of acute hemorrhagic and necrotic pancreatitis (AHNP) in rats.Thirty-six male Sprague-Dawley rats were studied. Sham animals (n = 12) received laparotomy and normothermia for AHNP with normothermia (n = 12), the core temperature was maintained at 37 degrees C to 37.5 degrees C after AHNP for 2 to 5 hoursMild hypothermia significantly decreased the release of serum amylase and lipase compared with AHNP normothermia at 2 and 5 hours. Histology examination revealed significantly less tissue damage in AHNP hypothermia. There was a further increase in TNF-alpha and IL-1beta in AHNP in animals with hypothermia compared with normothermia animals. The application of mild hypothermia significantly improved the survival in animals induced with AHNP.Mild hypothermia decreases amylase and lipase release and improves a survival of AHNP in rats.
