An increase in creatine kinase secondary to acute pancreatitis: a case report. Creatine kinase (CK) activity is found in high concentrations in skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle and brain. Here, we describe a 64-year-old woman with acute pancreatitis and elevated serum CK activity. This association is extraordinarily rare. In particular, laboratory findings which were found to be abnormal were serum CK 4.150 U/l (peaked 1 day after admission) with the CK-MB fraction being less than 5%, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 424 U/l, serum lipase 1.265 U/I and serum amylase 1.105 U/l. Some data regarding the phenomenon of acute pancreatitis and elevated serum CK activity are given.
