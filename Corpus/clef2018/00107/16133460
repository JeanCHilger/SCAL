Ascites in the puerperium: a missed diagnosis of acute postpartum pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis in pregnancy is often associated with severe morbidity. It is usually an antepartum problem occurring in late pregnancy. It rarely occurs in the postpartum period and when it does diagnosis can be difficult.We report a case of 'unexplained' ascites following ventouse delivery, diagnosed 6 weeks later as acute pancreatitis.Although it is rare, acute pancreatitis must be considered when evaluating patients presenting with abdominal pain and/or ascites in the postpartum period. Serum amylase may not always be elevated and early recourse to CT scan will facilitate diagnosis and allow for appropriate management.
