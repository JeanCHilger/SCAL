Can propofol precipitate pancreatitis in patients with Cushing's syndrome? We encountered two cases of acute pancreatitis in patients with Cushing's disease following transnasal transsphenoidal hypophysectomy. In both cases propofol was used in bolus doses, and is thought to be the probable factor for its development. Since elevated cortisol levels in Cushing's disease poses a threat for pancreatitis, there is a possibility that patients with Cushing's disease might be more prone to acute pancreatitis following propofol administration. Anaesthesiologists and physicians dealing with the management of Cushing's disease need to be aware of this possibility.
