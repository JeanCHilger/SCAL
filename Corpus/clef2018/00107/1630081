Informativeness of the methods of early clinical laboratory diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. In 92 patients with acute pancreatitis, the informative value of the available methods for laboratory investigations (general blood analysis, biochemical blood analysis with measurement of the level of total protein, bilirubin, glucose, ALAT, ASAT, amylase activity, amylase activity in the urine) was analysed. The authors consider that the indices studied are rather informative for independent reliable diagnosis of acute pancreatitis and differentiation of its forms.
