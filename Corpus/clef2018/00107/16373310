Acute pancreatitis in paediatric systemic lupus erythematosus. Acute pancreatitis (AP) rarely complicates the clinical course of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). AP as the initial manifestation of SLE is exceptional, but its outcome is often fatal. Corticosteroids have been suspected to play a role in the development of AP, but the therapeutic benefit seems to be far above the risk of exacerbation of pancreatic lesions. We report a 13-y-old girl presenting with arthralgia and malaise, followed by abdominal pain, generalized oedema and haemodynamic instability. Increased CRP (325 ng/ml), serum amylase (14,000 IU/l) and lipase (2500 IU/l) levels suggested AP. Acute anuric renal failure required haemodialysis. Multiorgan involvement suggested SLE, which was confirmed 3 d later by increased anti-ds-DNA levels. Three methylprednisolone pulses were administered promptly, followed by oral prednisone (1.5 mg/kg/d) and six pulses of cyclophosphamide (500 mg/1.73 m2/2 wk). Mycophenolate mofetil was introduced for long-term disease control. Amylase and lipase levels decreased over 4 wk. Renal function was normal after 3 wk and proteinuria negative after 6 wk. This case suggests that steroid pulse therapy should be promptly administered if clinical and biochemical investigations suggest SLE to be responsible for AP. Aggressive treatment may be life saving.
