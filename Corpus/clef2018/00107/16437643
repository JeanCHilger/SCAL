Alteration of chaperonin60 and pancreatic enzyme in pancreatic acinar cell under pathological condition. To investigate the changes of chaperonin60 (Cpn60) and pancreatic enzymes in pancreatic acinar cells, and to explore their roles in the development of experimental diabetes and acute pancreatitis (AP).Two different pathological models were replicated in Sprague-Dawley rats: streptozotocin-induced diabetes and sodium deoxycholate-induced AP. The contents of Cpn60 and pancreatic enzymes in different compartments of the acinar cells were measured by quantitative immunocytochemistry.The levels of Cpn60 significantly increased in diabetes, but decreased in AP, especially in the zymogen granules of the pancreatic acinar cells. The elevation of Cpn60 was accompanied with the increased levels of pancreatic lipase and chymotrypsinogen in diabetes. However, a decreased Cpn60 level was accompanied by high levels of lipase and chymotrypsinogen in AP. The amylase level was markedly reduced in both the pathological conditions.The equilibrium between Cpn60 and pancreatic enzymes in the acinar cells breaks in AP, and Cpn60 content decreases, suggesting an insufficient chaperone capacity. This may promote the aggregation and autoactivation of the premature enzymes in the pancreatic acinar cells and play roles in the development of AP.
