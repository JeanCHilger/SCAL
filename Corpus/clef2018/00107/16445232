Analysis of a complex of biochemical parameters of hepatic functions in opisthorchiasis. A complex of biochemical parameters of hepatic functions was analyzed in 170 patients with chronic opisthorchiasis and in 90 apparently healthy dwellers from a region wherein opisthorchiasis is endemic. The activity of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase, alpha-amylase, and choline esterase and the serum concentrations of bilirubin, cholesterol, and glucose were studied. A correlation analysis indicated that prolonged Opisthorchis invasion rearranged the system of interactions of the biochemical parameters of the functions of the liver and pancreas. The auxiliary ("local") standards obtained from a study of a group of apparently healthy dwellers from an opisthorchiasis-endemic region may be use to consider the results of individual examinations of patients with chronic opisthorchiasis in order to correct the processes of treatment and rehabilitation.
