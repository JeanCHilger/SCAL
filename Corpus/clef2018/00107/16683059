Influence of hydrocortisone, prednisolone, and NO association on the evolution of acute pancreatitis. Leukocyte activation, inflammatory up-regulation, and microcirculatory disruption associated with ischemia-reperfusion injury are hallmarks in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis (AP). NO donors ensure microvascular integrity, while glucocorticoids act as anti-inflammatory and immune modulator drugs. AP was induced by the biliopancreatic duct outlet exclusion-closed duodenal loops (BPDOE-CDLs) model. Treatment with hydrocortisone (6 mg/kg) or prednisolone (0.5 mg/kg) alone or together with DETA-NO (0.5 mg/kg) was done (a)1 hr pre or (b)1 hr post, or (c) 1 hr pre and 4 hr post ,or (d) 4 hr post triggering AP. NOS inhibition by L-NAME (15 mg/kg) and glucocorticoid receptor blockage by mifepristone (3 mg/kg) was considered. AP severity was assessed by biochemical and histopathological analyses. Treatment with glucocorticoids together with DETA-NO 1 hr pre and 4 hr post BPDOE-CDLs reduced serum amylase, lipase, C-reactive protein, IL-6, IL-10, hsp72, and 8-isoprostane as well as pancreatic and lung myeloperoxidase. Acinar and fat necrosis, hemorrhage, and neutrophil infiltrate were also decreased. Hydrocortisone together with DETA-NO rendered the best results. We conclude that AP severity was significantly diminished by glucocorticoids associated with DETA-NO, with the optimal dose and time point of administration being crucial to provide adequate protection against AP.
