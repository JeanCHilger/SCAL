The role of junctional adhesion molecule C (JAM-C) in acute pancreatitis. The recruitment of inflammatory cells contributes significantly to tissue injury in acute pancreatitis. This process implies several molecular interactions between circulating and endothelial cells. The adhesion molecule junctional adhesion molecule C (JAM-C) is involved in leukocyte transendothelial migration and it can form homophilic (JAM-C/JAM-C) and heterophilic interactions with the leukocyte integrin alpha(M)beta(2). In this study, the effect of early administration of monoclonal antibodies directed against JAM-C in cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis was assessed. This reagent significantly blocked influx of leukocytes, release of serum amylase, secretion of inflammatory cytokines, and acinar cell necrosis. These effects were rapid and protected against tissue injury throughout the duration of the model. Conversely, cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis was more severe in transgenic mice overexpressing JAM-C on endothelial cells under the control of the Tie2 promoter. It is proposed that JAM-C expressed by endothelial cells contributes to the pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis and could be considered a target for clinical applications.
