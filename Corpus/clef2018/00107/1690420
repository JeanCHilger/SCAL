Protective effect of misoprostol, a synthetic prostaglandin E1 analog, on cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in rats. This study was performed to assess the effects of misoprostol, a synthetic prostaglandin E1 analog, on cerulein-induced pancreatitis. Per group of 10 each, male Wistar rats received either cerulein (2.5 micrograms/kg/h subcutaneously), cerulein and misoprostol (500 micrograms/kg intraperitoneally at 0 and 4 h), or saline. Rats were killed 6 h after the first injection. Misoprostol treatment significantly reduced interstitial edema and acinar cell lesions induced by hyperstimulation. Pancreatic amylase and chymotrypsin contents were increased by cerulein and returned towards control levels in the misoprostol-treated group. The lysosomal volume density and the pancreatic beta-D-glucuronidase activity were significantly increased after hyperstimulation. The two parameters were significantly reduced by misoprostol. A protective effect of misoprostol against lesions induced by cerulein hyperstimulation would be a consequence of a lysosomal stabilizating effect.
