The effect of caerulein induced pancreatitis on the hepatic microvasculature. A three-dimensional morphological study of the hepatic microvasculature in caerulein induced oedematous pancreatitis was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) vascular casts and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of hepatocytes and hepatic sinusoids. TEM studies provided ultrastructural evidence of hepatocellular damage while SEM views demonstrated gross irregularity of the sinusoidal outline with abruptly terminating sinusoidal buds and extravasation of cast material, findings which were similar to those previously reported in the pancreas itself using the same model and which were supported by TEM cross-sectional views of the hepatic sinusoids. The results suggest that caerulein induced pancreatitis is associated with extrapancreatic microvascular damage which may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of extrapancreatic organ impairment associated with acute pancreatitis.
