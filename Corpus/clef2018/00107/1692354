Pancreatic hypersecretion in pancreatitis. Extensive data on clinical and experimental pathology of pancreatic function are reviewed. In literature there is much controversy on the presence of hyperenzymatic secretion on the mechanism of hypersecretion and therapeutic policy for pancreatitis with hypersecretion. Fifty patients with chronic pancreatitis were evaluated functionally. Experimental study of progressing pancreatitis showed enhanced protein biosynthesis in the initial disease. Protein spectra were shifted. It is stated that hypersecretion can be either primary or secondary depending on the cause of pancreatic inflammation which is thought to initiate pancreatic hypersecretion as such.
