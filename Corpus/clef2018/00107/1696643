Effect of peripheral pancreatic duct obstruction on the progression of chronic pancreatitis. Experimental chronic pancreatitis model were made in five dogs with chronic pancreatic fistula by injection of microspheres into peripheral pancreatic duct. Sequential changes of pancreatic exocrine and endocrine functions also with morphology were studied. Significant decrease of volume, bicarbonate output, and amylase output of pure pancreatic juice (PPJ) separately collected with stimulation of secretin were detected. While, viscosity of PPJ was significantly increased with concomitant increase of hexosamine concentration. Chronic pancreatitis was demonstrated morphologically also. These results suggest that concentrated PPJ caused by decrease in volume in PPJ and increase in viscosity of PPJ with concomitant increase in hexosamine concentration bring about the progression of chronic pancreatitis in this experimental model.
