Acute experimental enzymatic cholecystitis (clinico-morphological comparisons). In the experiment on 30 mongrel dogs, acute enzymatic cholecystitis (AEC) was modelled by means of intraduodenal connection with a fluoroplastic catheter of the common bile duct and pancreatic duct. The animals died at day 3-5 from transudative biliary peritonitis. A correlation between the severity of the clinical course, pronouncement of enzymologic shifts (increase in activity of amylase and phospholipase A2, content of biliary malonic dialdehyde) and morphological changes in the gallbladder and common bile duct in the form of necrosis and round-cell infiltration of the mucosa was revealed. Only decompression of the bile duct within the first 6 h from the moment of AEC development contributes to regression of clinical and enzymologic disorders and recovery of the animals.
