Ghrelin and melatonin in the regulation of pancreatic exocrine secretion and maintaining of integrity. Ghrelin and melatonin are produced in the central nervous system and in the gastrointestinal tissues ghrelin in the stomach, and melatonin - in the liver and in the intestine. Both ghrelin and melatonin have been reported to protect the gastric mucosa against acute lesions and to influence gastrointestinal motility and secretions, however the physiological significance of these peptides in the gastrointestinal tissues remains unknown. In spite of the presence of ghrelin and melatonin receptors in the pancreatic tissue little is known about the role of these peptides in the pancreas. It is very likely that both ghrelin and melatonin, which are released from the gastrointestinal tract in relation to food ingestion, could be implicated in the postprandial stimulation of pancreatic enzyme secretion though the activation of cholinergic entero-pancreatic reflex and CCK release. Our experimental studies have shown that exogenous melatonin, as well as this produced endogenously from its precursor
