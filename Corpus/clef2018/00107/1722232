Pancreatic enlargement in alcoholic pancreatitis: prevalence and natural history. We determined the prevalence and natural history of pancreatic enlargement by abdominal ultrasonography or computed tomography in 72 patients with alcoholic pancreatitis. Pancreatic enlargement was observed in 54 patients (75%) it was diffuse in 28 (52%) and focal in 26 (48%). The focal enlargement was frequently cystic (50%), while the diffuse enlargement was only occasionally cystic (7%). Sequential imaging of the pancreas in 29 patients demonstrated partial to total resolution of pancreatic enlargement in greater than 50% during 6 months of follow-up. Determination of serum amylase and p-isoamylase activity was neither sensitive nor specific for pancreatic enlargement in alcoholic pancreatitis.
