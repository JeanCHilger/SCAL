Mild ERCP-induced and non-ERCP-related acute pancreatitis: two distinct clinical entities? The aim of this study was to evaluate the hypothesis that mild endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)-induced acute pancreatitis (AP) runs a distinctly shorter clinical course compared with mild attacks caused by other etiological factors.ERCP-induced AP was defined as the persistence of postprocedure abdominal pain requiring analgesia for at least 24 h in association with hyperamylasemia of more than three times the normal value. Among 2552 patients who had undergone ERCP between 1996 and 2002 in two different hospitals, mild AP developed after "elective" ERCP in 48 (group I). Among a random sample of 10% of 700 patients admitted with AP to both hospitals during the same study period, 58 had mild non-ERCP-related AP (group II). Results shown are medians.Patients in group I had significantly shorter durations of pain (55 vs. 114 h, P < 0.0001), analgesic intake (56 vs.93 h, P = 0.007), and intravenous hydration (48 vs. 80 h, P < 0.0001), a lower opiate analgesic requirement (58 mg morphine equivalent vs. 100 mg, P = 0.001), a shorter time to resumption of oral diet (3 vs. 5 days, P < 0.0001), and a shorter hospital stay (4 vs. 7 days, P < 0.0001) than patients in group II.The current definitions of ERCP-induced AP select a cohort of patients whose mild attacks run a significantly shorter and milder course than non-ERCP-related mild attacks. A new consensus definition of ERCP-induced AP that describes attacks of similar clinical course is needed.
