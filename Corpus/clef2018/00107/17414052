IS-741 attenuates local migration of monocytes and subsequent pancreatic fibrosis in experimental chronic pancreatitis induced by dibutyltin dichloride in rats. Chronic pancreatitis consists of excessive leukocyte infiltration and fibrosis. IS-741 has been reported to be an antiinflammatory drug through an inhibitory action on cell adhesion. In this study, we investigated whether IS-741 could inhibit the progression of pancreatic fibrosis through monocyte infiltration. Moreover, we investigated the effect of IS-741 on rat pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs).Chronic pancreatitis was induced by dibutyltin dichloride in rats. From days 7 to 28 after dibutyltin dichloride application, IS-741 or distilled water was administered. At days 14 and 28, histological [hematoxylin-eosin stain and immunostain for ED1 and [alpha] smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA)] and biochemical evaluations (intrapancreatic amylase, protein, cytokines, chemokines, and alpha-SMA) were performed. In vitro, rat PSCs were incubated with cytokine, chemokine, and growth factor simultaneously with IS-741, and their proliferation and activation were examined.Histologically, IS-741 inhibited pancreatic fibrosis and decreased the number of ED1- and [alpha]-SMA-positive cells. The intrapancreatic expression of cytokines, chemokine, and [alpha]-SMA were also decreased. In vitro, IS-741 has no direct effect on the proliferation, alpha-SMA expression, and collagen synthesis of PSCs.These results suggest that IS-741 suppressed macrophage infiltration and subsequent pancreatic fibrosis and that the infiltration of monocytes into pancreas is essential for pancreatic fibrosis.
