Severe, gestational, non-familial, non-genetic hypertriglyceridemia. Severe hypertriglyceridemia is a rare condition in pregnancy. All the cases of severe gestational hypertriglyceridemia that have been reported previously in the literature were caused by genetic mutations or familial hypertriglyceridemia secondary to lipoprotein lipase deficiency or apolipoprotein C-II deficiency. We report the first case of severe, non-genetic, non-familial, pregnancy-induced hypertriglyceridemia. The genetic underlying causes were excluded by molecular genetic investigation. The reported case was managed solely by strict dietary control. Hypertriglyceridemia was diagnosed incidentally during pregnancy, in this case, while taking a blood sample to check her hemoglobin level. Acute pancreatitis, which is a relatively common life threatening complication of this condition, was avoided. This report reviews the subtypes of hyperlipidemia, clinical picture, antenatal management and its effect on pregnancy and vice versa. It is important that the clinician has a clear understanding of the normal lipid profile during pregnancy, the clinical picture, the potential complications, available treatment options of hypertriglyceridemia particularly during pregnancy. The timing and route of delivery should be individualized.
