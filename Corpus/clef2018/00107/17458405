Ezetimibe-induced acute pancreatitis. Ezetimibe is a lipid-lowering agent that inhibits the intestinal absorption of cholesterol and other related phytosterols. It is used alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering agents in the treatment of various forms of hypercholesterolemia. Since its FDA approval in 2002, there are no known citations of ezetimibe-induced pancreatitis.
