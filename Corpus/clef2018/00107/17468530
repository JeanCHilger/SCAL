Encephalopathy in type I hyperlipidemia. Familial chylomicronemia syndrome is a group of rare genetic disorders characterized by deficient activity of an enzyme lipoprotein lipase or apo-protein C-II deficiency. In this paper we present an infant with massive hyperchylomicronemia and severe pancreatitis. Exchange transfusion for controlling hypertriglyceridemia and pancreatitis led to an increase in hyperviscosity which resulted in encephalopathy.
