Update on dyslipidemia. Recently, considerable progress has been made in understanding the genetic basis of dyslipidemias and in studying the safety and efficacy of lipid-lowering drugs for coronary heart disease (CHD) prevention. Novel loci have been identified for monogenic hypercholesterolemia, such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR)-associated protein, proprotein convertase subtilisin-like kexin type 9, and ATP-binding cassette transporters ABCG5 and ABCG8. LDLR-associated protein promotes clustering of LDLRs into clathrin-coated pits for LDL uptake proprotein convertase subtilisin-like kexin type 9 is involved in LDLR degradation
