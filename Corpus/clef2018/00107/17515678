Typhoid fever and acute pancreatitis: two cases. Acute pancreatitis is a pancreatic inflammation that recognises Salmonella typhi among its aetiological agents. In this article the authors describe two cases of acute pancreatitis secondary to typhoid fever, evolving towards complete recovery. These two cases, besides confirming that Salmonella typhi can be responsible for acute pancreatitis, remind us that during typhoid fever, amylase enzyme test should be always assessed. Moreover, salmonella infection must also be considered in cases of non-alcoholic or non-lithiasic pancreatitis.
