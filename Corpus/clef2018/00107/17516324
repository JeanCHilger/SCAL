Mediastinal necrosis in acute pancreatitis - case report. Ascites, pseudocyst, necrosis of the retroperitoneal fat tissue and pancreatopleural fistula with left sided pleural effusion may complicate pancreatitis. However, steatonecrosis of the mediastinum and right side pleural effusion are rather rare complications of pancreatitis. We present a case of a patient with alcohol induced pancreatitis. Chest x-ray showed right sided pleural effusion. Although high levels of amylase in pleural fluid made the diagnosis of pancreatopleural fistula most likely, necrosis of the mediastinal fat tissue with right side pleural effusion was found postmortem.
