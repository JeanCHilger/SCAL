Functional polymorphisms of the GSTT-1 gene do not predict the severity of acute pancreatitis in the United States. Acute pancreatitis (AP) is an inflammatory response to pancreatic injury that is clinically classified as mild AP or severe AP, depending on specific criteria. Rahman and colleagues [Gastroenterology 2004126:1312-1322] reported that genetic variation in the glutathione S-transferase theta-1 gene (GSTT-1) is associated with susceptibility and severity of AP in England. Our aim was to determine whether the same GSTT-1 polymorphism affects the severity of AP in a population from Pittsburgh, Pa., USA.Ninety-one consecutive patients with AP (19 severe) were prospectively evaluated. The GSTT-1 haplotypes were determined by PCR amplification in all patients and 268 controls. The resulting genotypes were classified as functional (GSTT-1*A/*A or *A/null) and nonfunctional (GSTT-1 null/null) phenotypes.The relative frequencies of functional GSTT-1 phenotypes were similar in subjects with severe AP (15 of 19, 78.9%) and mild AP (61 of 72, 84.7% p = 0.54) and in the controls (228 of 268, 85.1%Functional GSTT-1 phenotypes do not correlate with susceptibility to AP or severity of AP in our patient population.
