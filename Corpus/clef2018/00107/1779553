Diagnosis and treatment of acute pancreatitis. From study of 549 patients with various forms of acute pancreatitis (AP) the authors conclude that membrane disorders occur in these patients, in which case membrane modulators, products of lipid peroxidation (PLO) among others, play an inducing role. In addition to the routine clinical data, of great significance for the diagnosis of AP are laboratory findings on lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, endogenous enzymes, transamidinase, concentrations of free kinins, blood coagulative system, study of free radical oxidation of lipids, beta-lipoprotein levels, etc. The authors recommend a wider use of fatty emulsions with heparin and intraarterial infusion of agents in the generally accepted complex of therapeutic measures. Operative treatment is usually indicated in approximately 20% of cases.
