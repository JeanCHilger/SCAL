Neuroendocrine aspects of the pathogenesis of fatty pancreonecrosis. In fatty pancreonecrosis, ejection of the considerable amount of endogenous insulin into the blood occurs. Insulin is a potent inhibitor of gluconeogenesis, a most important hormone of lipogenesis, and at the same time considerably inhibits lipolysis. This defines its pathogenetic role in the development of fatty pancreonecrosis.
