Effects of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta inhibition on the development of cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in mice. Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3 is a ubiquitous serine-threonine protein kinase that participates in a multitude of cellular processes and signal transduction pathways. It also plays an important role in the pathophysiology of a number of diseases characterized by an enhanced or unregulated inflammatory response. Here we investigate the effects of GSK-3beta inhibition on the development of experimental acute pancreatitis induced by cerulein in mice.Prospective, randomized study.University-based research laboratory.One-hundred and sixty anesthetized male CD mice.Pancreatitis was induced by intraperitoneal injection of cerulein (hourly x5, 50 microg/kg). In the treatment group, the potent and selective GSK-3beta inhibitor 4-benzyl-2-methyl-1,2,4-thiadiazolidine-3,5-dione (TDZD-8) was administered 1 hr and 6 hrs after the first injection of cerulein (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). Sham groups were treated with vehicle (0.1 mL of 0.9% NaCl, intraperitoneally) and TDZD-8. In another set of experiments, mice were monitored for 24 days to determine their mortality rate.The injection of cerulein resulted in acute necrotizing pancreatitis. TDZD-8 significantly reduced the degree of pancreas injury, amylase, and lipase serum levels (p < .01) nuclear factor-kappaB activation (p < .01)Inhibition of GSK-3beta reduces the degree of cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis and the associated mortality rate in mice. Blocking protein kinase activity may be a novel approach to treatment of this inflammatory condition.
