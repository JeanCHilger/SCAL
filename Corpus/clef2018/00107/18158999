Protective effect of proteasome inhibitor MG-132 in rats with severe acute pancreatitis and lung injury. To observe the protective effect of the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 in rats with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) and the associated lung injury.In rat models of the SAP established with injection of 5% sodium taurocholate into the biliary-pancreatic duct, the changes of the serum amylase and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in the pancreatic and lung tissues were evaluated. The pathological changes of the pancreatic and lung tissues were also observed.MG-132 significantly decreased serum amylase, pancreatic weight/body weight ratio, and pancreatic and pulmonary myeloperoxidase activity (P<0.05). Histopathological examinations revealed milder edema, cellular damage, and inflammation in the pancreatic and lung tissues of rats pretreated with the peptide (P<0.05).MG-132 ameliorates SAP and the associated lung injury in rats.
