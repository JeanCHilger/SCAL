Effect of short-term-ischemia and reperfusion on the rat pancreas. In order to examine the toxic effects on the pancreas of oxygen free radicals which are generated at reperfusion after ischemia, a short term-ischemia/reperfusion model was prepared in rats. Both the anterior mesenteric artery and the celiac artery were ligated and then released to restore blood flow. In a group where the anterior mesenteric and the celiac arteries were ligated for 60 minutes, the serum levels of amylase and lipase rose 7 and 6 times, respectively, 7 hours after reperfusion. In a group ligated for 30 minutes, both levels remained unchanged. Histologically, vacuolization of the pancreatic acinar cells was observed, only in a group rats ischemic for 7 hours. In rats ligated for 60 minutes with a continuous venous infusion of superoxide dismutase (SOD) (3600 U/Kg/hour), the secretion of amylase and lipase decreased to 25 percent of that in the non-injected group. These results confirm that the oxygen free radicals, which are generated by the short term-ischemia/reperfusion method, injure the pancreas. This may lead to pancreatitis with hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia. Pretreatment with an active oxygen scavenger, SOD, markedly reduces the rise in serum amylase and lipase levels. This suggests that active oxygen free radicals are involved in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis.
