A case of acute intermittent porphyria with acute pancreatitis. A case of acute pancreatitis in a 29-year-old female associated with an attack of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is reported. Following the attack of AIP, serum pancreatic amylase originating from the pancreas increased transiently, and mild swelling of the pancreas was detected by ultrasonography. On this basis acute pancreatitis was diagnosed. Additionally, this patient had mild hepatic dysfunction. Laparoscopy disclosed diffuse slightly dark bluish pigmentation on the irregular surface of the liver. Mild fibrous dilatation of the portal area with lymphocytic infiltration was seen histologically. Acute pancreatitis and hepatic damage with AIP is extremely rare, however it is possible that these findings are etiologically connected in this patient.
