Hyperglycaemia, stress oxidant, liver dysfunction and histological changes in diabetic male rat pancreas and liver: protective effect of 17 beta-estradiol. Oxidative stress is thought to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of chronic diabetic complications. We investigated the protective effects of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) on alloxan-induced stress oxidant, hepatic dysfunction and histological changes in male rats liver and pancreas. Our results showed that 17 beta-estradiol could attenuate the increase of blood glucose in plasma and normalise the hepatic glycogen level. In addition, E2 enhanced superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) (by 207, 52 and 72%, respectively, as compared to diabetic rats), reduced lipid peroxidation in the hepatic tissue (by 54%) and improved the liver dysfunction parameters by the significant decrease of gamma-glytamyl transferase (GGT), phosphatases alkalines (PAL), lactate deshydrogenase (LDH) and aspartate and lactate transaminases (AST and ALT) activities which increased in diabetic rats. Moreover, 17 beta-estradiol treatment in diabetic rats protects against alloxan-induced pancreatic beta-cells and hepatic cells damages.
