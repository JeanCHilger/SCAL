Tissue adhesives and the pancreas: biocompatibility and adhesive properties of 6 preparations. The aim of this study was to investigate biocompatibility and adhesive properties of 6 tissue adhesives available, when applied between the pancreas and jejunum in an experimental model.Portion of jejunum was glued on the pancreas in rats with 3 cyanoacrylate derivatives (Histoacryl, Dermabond, and Glubran 2), 2 human fibrin sealants (Tisseel Duo Quick and Quixil), and 1 albuminglutaraldehyde sealant (BioGlue). Pancreatic tissue specimens and blood samples were harvested 1, 3, 7, and 21 days after gluing for histological determination and amylase activity measurement. Pancreaticojejunal attachment created with adhesives underwent tensile strength measurement at each time point. Samples were also taken from unoperated rats and sham-operated rats.Exposure and sham groups both induced a similar increase in amylase activity on day 1 with normalization by day 3. Sham operation induced mild changes in the pancreas. Each tissue adhesive induced changes in pancreatic histology to the entire gland. Injurious effect was more severe with the 3 cyanoacrylates than with the 3 fibrin/semisynthetic glues. Histoacryl and Quixil induced lower tensile strength than the other adhesives.All of the tissue adhesives studied induced histological changes in the pancreas of which at least part might be considered harmful. The potentially harmful tissue effects of the preparations tested might compromise the use of these substances in pancreatic surgery.
