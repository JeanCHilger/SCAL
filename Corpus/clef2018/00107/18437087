Small-interference RNA gene knockdown of pancreatitis-associated proteins in rat acute pancreatitis. Pancreatitis-associated proteins (PAPs) are induced in acute pancreatitis and antisense-mediated gene knockdown of PAP decreased PAP gene expression and worsened pancreatitis. Here, we investigated the effect of a more stable inhibition of PAP using small-interference RNA gene knockdown in vitro and in an in vivo model of experimental pancreatitis.Pancreatitis-associated protein-specific siRNA was administered to AR42J cell cultures or rats induced with pancreatitis. Controls included administration of scrambled siRNA or vehicle alone. After 24 hours, cells and pancreata were harvested and assessed for PAP (PAP 1, PAP 2, PAP 3) gene expression and pancreatitis severity.In vitro, PAP protein, and mRNA levels were reduced (PAP 1, 76% PAP 2, 8%siRNA-mediated gene knockdown of PAP worsens pancreatitis. Differences in gene knockdown technology may provide different approaches to study gene function.
