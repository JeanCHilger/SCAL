The effect of synacthen on acute necrotizing pancreatitis in rats. This study investigates the hypothesis that an adrenocorticotropic hormone-analog therapy may ameliorate relative adrenal insufficiency in the early phase of acute necrotizing pancreatitis (NP) by boosting endogenous glucocorticoid production.Forty Wistar rats with taurocholate-induced NP were divided into 5 groups: the first group received low-dose Synacthen (0.5 mg/kg) the second, high-dose Synacthen (5mg/kg)Corticosterone increased neither in the low-dose nor in the high-dose Synacthen group. Synacthen did not improve the early course of NP in terms of laboratory and histological results. A reduction of pancreatic necrosis and inflammation was observed in the low-dose cortisol group.Endogenous glucocorticoid release seemed to be at its maximum during the early stage of NP and could not be further increased by Synacthen. Low-dose exogenous cortisol ameliorated the disease. These findings support the existence of relative adrenal insufficiency in the early phase of acute NP.
