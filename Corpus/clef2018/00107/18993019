Pancreatic-type hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia secondary to ruptured ovarian cyst: a case report and review of the literature. Although salivary-type hyperamylasemia is known to occur with ovarian pathologies such as salpingitis and adenocarcinoma, pancreatic-type hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia are considered to be highly specific for pancreatitis.To discuss the interpretation of hyperamylasemia in the context of acute abdominal pain, implications for management, and to review the literature relating to non-pancreatic causes of hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia.We present the case of a 25-year-old woman who presented with an acute abdomen and a markedly elevated pancreatic-type amylase and lipase in whom acute pancreatitis was suspected. Further investigations showed that the underlying pathology was actually a ruptured ovarian cyst causing massive intra-abdominal hemorrhage and necessitating emergency laparotomy.This case represents an initial report of pancreatic-type hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia occurring with ovarian pathology and hemoperitoneum. Although these derangements may have been secondary to peritoneal irritation, this case raises the possibility that ovarian tissue is able to secrete large amounts of pancreatic-type amylase and lipase in addition to salivary-type amylase. Clinicians should be aware that simultaneous elevations of both enzymes are not necessarily pathognomic of acute pancreatitis.
