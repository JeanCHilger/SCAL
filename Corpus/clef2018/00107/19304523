Effect of resveratrol-induced FasL up-regulation on the apoptosis of pancreatic acinar cells in rats with severe acute pancreatitis. To investigate the effect of resveratrol on the apoptosis of pancreatic acinar cells in rats with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) and explore the mechanism of such effect.SD rats with 3.5% sodium taurocholate-induced SAP were treated with resveratrol, and the serum amylase was detected with automatic biochemistry analyzer. The apoptosis of the pancreatic acinar cells in the rats was detected by TUNEL assay, and the expression of Fas and FasL genes was determined by RT-PCR and Western blotting. The pathological changes of the pancreas were observed under optical microscope.Compared with SAP group, the resveratrol-treated rats showed obviously decreased serum amylase and scores for pancreatic histopathological lesions. Resveratrol treatment significantly increased the apoptotic indices of pancreatic acinar cells and the levels of FasL mRNA and protein in rats with SAP.Resveratrol produces important therapeutic effect on SAP in rats by inducing pancreatic acinar cell apoptosis possibly as a result of up-regulated FasL gene expression.
