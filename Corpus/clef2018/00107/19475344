Acute pancreatitis as the initial presentation in pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus. It is exceptionally rare for acute pancreatitis to be the presenting manifestation of childhood systemic lupus erythematosus. We report a 14-year-old girl who presented with a history of fever, generalized rash, arthralgia and abdominal pain. Her serum amylase was 1472U/L and lipase 3316 U/L suggestive of acute pancreatitis. Other investigations revealed pancytopenia, low complement, high 24-hour urinary protein and elevated ANA and dsDNA. She was treated with IV methylprednisone, followed by oral steroids.
