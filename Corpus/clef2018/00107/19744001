Plasma concentrations of growth arrest-specific protein 6 and protein S in patients with acute pancreatitis. The aim of the present study was to clarify the changes in plasma concentrations of growth arrest-specific protein 6 (Gas6) and protein S (PS) in patients with mild or severe acute pancreatitis (AP).The study group comprised 29 consecutive patients with AP (24 males, five females mean age, 54.8 +/- 15.0 years) and 20 healthy controls (10 males, 10 femalesThe concentration of Gas6 was significantly higher in both severe and mild AP than in healthy controls, and was significantly correlated with two of the multiple organ failure assessment scores. Furthermore, when compared with survivors, the concentrations of Gas6 in non-survivors of severe AP were significantly increased. The concentrations of free PS and total PS were significantly decreased compared with normal controls, but there was no difference between cases and controls in the concentrations of C4 binding protein-PS.Plasma concentrations of Gas6 and PS correlate with disease severity. High concentrations of Gas6 reflect microcirculatory abnormalities, and phagocytosis of dying cells in sepsis associated with severe AP.
