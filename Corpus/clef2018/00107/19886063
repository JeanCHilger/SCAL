Risk factors in chronic pancreatitis. Chronic pancreatitis is an inflammatory disease followed by structural alterations--inflammation, fibrosis and acinar atrophy--pain emergence, exocrine and endocrine pancreatic insufficiency, severe alteration of quality of life. The pathogenetic mechanisms characteristic to this disease are not thoroughly known, but the identification of some genetic and autoimmune factors in certain entities has elucidated several pathogenetic links. The etiologic risk factors for chronic pancreatitis may associate each other and may cause different evolutions to the disease. By tracing out the risk factors and their typical working mechanisms, further pathogenetic treatments may occur, taking place precociously and preventing the evolution of the disease towards exocrine and endocrine pancreatic insufficiency.
