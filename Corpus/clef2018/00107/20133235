Pathological changes at early stage of multiple organ injury in a rat model of severe acute pancreatitis. Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) is a commonly seen acute abdominal syndrome characterized by sudden onset, rapid progression and high mortality rate. The damage in peripheral organs may be more severe than that in the pancreas, and can even lead to multiple organ dysfunction. It is critical to recognize early pathological changes in multiple organs. This study aimed to assess the early pathological features of damaged organs in a rat model of SAP.Thirty clean grade healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250-300 g were randomly divided into a model control group (n=15) and a sham-operated group (n=15). The SAP rat model was induced by sodium taurocholate. Samples of blood and from multiple organs were collected 3 hours after operation. We assessed the levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha, PLA2, NO, ET-1, MDA, amylases and endotoxin in blood and observed the early pathological changes in multiple damaged organs.Levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha, PLA2, NO, ET-1 and MDA in serum and of amylase and endotoxin in plasma of the model control group rats were significantly higher than those of the sham-operated group (P<0.01). Different degrees of pathological change were observed in multiple damaged organs.Multiple organ injury may occur at the early stage of SAP in rats.
