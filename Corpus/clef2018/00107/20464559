Exogenous melatonin treatment reduces hepatocyte damage in rats with experimental acute pancreatitis. The hormone melatonin affects cellular immunity in particular and the immune system in general both directly and indirectly. We report our evaluation of the effects of decreasing and increasing serum melatonin levels on hepatocyte damage in rats with experimental acute pancreatitis.Wistar Albino rats with experimentally induced acute pancreatitis were divided into three groups of ten rats each: (1) control (induced acute pancreatitis only) (2) rats with induced acute pancreatitis plus surgical pinealectomy (no melatonin injections)Rats undergoing the pinealectomy had increased amylase and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, while those receiving injections of exogenous melatonin had decreased amylase, aspartate transaminase, LDH, and bilirubin levels but increased levels of alanine transferase levels.Melatonin may have a therapeutic or protective effect on acute pancreatitis and obstructive jaundice.
