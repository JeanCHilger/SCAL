A comparison of presentation and management trends in acute pancreatitis between infants/toddlers and older children. Acute pancreatitis is a necroinflammatory disease that leads to 210,000 hospitalizations in the United States annually. Recent reports suggest that there may be important differences in clinical features between infants/toddlers and older children. Thus, in this study we make a direct comparison between the pediatric age groups in presentation and management trends of acute pancreatitis.We examined all children (ages 0 to 20 years) admitted to Yale-New Haven Children's Hospital with pancreatitis between 1994 and 2007.Two hundred seventy-one cases met inclusion criteria for acute pancreatitis. Infants and toddlers manifested fewer signs and symptoms of abdominal pain, epigastric tenderness, and nausea compared with older children (43% vs 93% 57% vs 90%Infants and toddlers with acute pancreatitis present with fewer classical symptoms and are managed differently from older children. We believe these data will be helpful in evaluating and understanding treatment practices in this age group.
