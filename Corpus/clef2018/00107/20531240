Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein for the prediction of severity of acute pancreatitis. To investigate the performance of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) for predicting severe acute pancreatitis (AP).Fifty patients with AP were prospectively enrolled. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and CRP were measured at admission and every 12 hours for 48 hours after admission.The patients' mean age was 50 ± 2.2 years, 64% were male, and 30% developed severe AP. Patients with severe AP had higher levels of ESR (77 ± 4.7 vs 50 ± 4.8 mm/h P = 0.002) and CRP (218 ± 30.7 vs 97 ± 12.1 mg/LErythrocyte sedimentation rate can predict severe AP with a slightly inferior performance to CRP. Combined ESR and CRP at 24 hours can predict severe AP accurately.
