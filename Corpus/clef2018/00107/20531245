Role of ulinastatin in preventing post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis: the Emperor's New Clothes or Aladdin's Magic Lamp? The role of prophylactic ulinastatin in the prevention of post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis is debated. A meta-analysis of all published randomized clinical trials was performed to evaluate the efficacy of ulinastatin on post-ERCP pancreatitis.Searches were conducted in multiple databases composed of PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the Science Citation Index Expanded, and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure series full-text database. Primary outcome was post-ERCP pancreatitis, with or without hyperamylasemia.Seven randomized clinical trials fulfilling the inclusion criteria were selected for meta-analysis, 5 comparing ulinastatin with placebo and 2 for ulinastatin versus gabexate. The incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis was reduced by ulinastatin (odds ratio, 0.53 95% confidence interval, 0.31-0.89Ulinastatin shows to be of value on preventing post-ERCP pancreatitis and hyperamylasemia for patients in average risk, when given intravenously at a dose of not less than 150,000 U, just before ERCP. More high-quality trials are needed for further confirmation.
