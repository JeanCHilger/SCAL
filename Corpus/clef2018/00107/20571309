Hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis treated with insulin in a nondiabetic patient. Heparin and/or insulin stimulate lipoprotein lipase and are known to decrease serum triglyceride level. However, their efficacy in hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis in nondiabetic patients is not well documented. We report a case of hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis in 43-year-old nondiabetic woman in whom treatment with insulin was accompanied by reduction in serum triglyceride level and the resolution of pancreatitis. She presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain and biochemical evidence of acute pancreatitis. Her medical history was unremarkable. There was no history of alcohol consumption, and biliary imaging was not remarkable. Subsequent laboratory investigation revealed marked hypertriglyceridemia (1,951 mg/dL), impaired fasting glucose, and normal HbAlc level. The Ransons score and APATCH II score were 1 and 4. Abdominal CT showed diffuse enlargement of pancreas, peripancreatic fat infiltration, and multiple fluid collections around the pancreas. We treated the patient with the infusion of 5% dextrose and 1.5 unit/hr regular insulin to reduce serum triglyceride level. The level of serum triglyceride was decreased to 305 mg/dL on day 5. During the remainder of hospitalization, her clinical symptoms and laboratory values gradually improved.
