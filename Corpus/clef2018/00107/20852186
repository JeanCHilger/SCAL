Effects of enteral immunonutrition on the maintenance of gut barrier function and immune function in pigs with severe acute pancreatitis. This study evaluated the effects of enteral immunonutrition (EIN) supplemented with glutamine, arginine, and probiotics on gut barrier function and immune function in pigs with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP).The model was induced by retrograde injection of 5% sodium taurocholate and trypsin via the pancreatic duct. After induction of SAP, 18 pigs were randomly divided into 3 groups, in which either parenteral nutrition (PN), control enteral nutrition (CEN), or EIN was applied for 8 days. Serum and pancreatic fluid amylase concentration was determined. Intestinal permeability (lactulose to mannitol ratio) was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography, and plasma endotoxin was quantified by the chromogenic limulus amebocyte lysate technique. Samples of venous blood and organs were cultured using standard techniques. Pancreatitis severity and villi of ileum were scored according to histopathologic grading. Plasma T-lymphocyte subsets were measured by flow cytometry, and immunoglobulins (Igs) were determined via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.There were no significant differences in serum and pancreatic fluid amylases concentrations or in pancreatitis severity between any 2 of the 3 groups. Compared with PN and CEN, EIN significantly decreased intestinal permeability, plasma endotoxin concentration, and the incidence and magnitudes of bacterial translocation, but increased ileal mucosal thickness, villous height, crypt depth, and percentage of normal intestinal villi. Significant differences were found in CD3+, CD4+ lymphocyte subsets, the ratio of CD4+: CD8+ lymphocyte subsets, and serum IgA and IgG, but not IgM, between any 2 of the 3 groups.EIN maintained gut barrier function and immune function in pigs with SAP.
