Emergent therapy with therapeutic plasma exchange in acute recurrent pancreatitis due to severe hypertriglyceridemia. Hypertriglyceridemia causes acute pancreatitis in 1.3-3.8% of patients. We report here on two cases with severe (triglyceride level >1000 mg/dL) hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute recurrent pancreatitis. Both patients had uncontrolled hypertriglyceridemia and suffered from acute pancreatitis. No cause of secondary hypertriglyceridemia was detected. While stage E pancreatitis (Ranson's score: 2) was diagnosed in the first case, stage D pancreatitis with a null Ranson's score was detected in the second case. Both patients were treated with classical treatment with fluid replacement, analgesic, antibiotics and discontinuation of oral intake. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) with fresh frozen plasma was performed consecutively and with two procedures on the 2nd and 3rd day in the first case. After TPE, while the triglyceride levels decreased from 4408 to 302 mg/dL, the amylase levels dropped from 4234 to 171 IU/L. In the second case, TPE was performed once daily. After TPE, the levels of triglyceride and amylase decreased from 2210 mg/dL and 1618 IU/L to 154 mg/dL and 110 IU/L, respectively. Local and systemic complications due to acute pancreatitis were not observed. Clinical signs and laboratory values improved. At the two-year follow-up of both patients, acute pancreatitis had not recurred with regular fenofibrate treatment. Hypertriglyceridemia should be considered in patients with acute recurrent pancreatitis. Although there is no definitive evidence for early application of TPE in severe hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis yet, therapy with TPE may be of benefit, improving the clinical course.
