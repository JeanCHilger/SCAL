Acute pancreatitis as initial manifestation of adult Henoch-Schönlein purpura: report of a case and review of literature. Abdominal pain observed in Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is usually attributed to edema and hemorrhage in the small bowel wall, secondary to a small-vessel vasculitis. Pancreatitis secondary to HSP is extremely rare. Here we report a 53-year-old man presented with acute pancreatitis that developed into characteristic rashes seen during HSP at the second day of the clinical onset, together with arthritis and glomerulonephritis. HSP is a rare and benign cause of acute pancreatitis. This complication can occur as an initial manifestation of HSP. Elevated serum amylase level can be considered as the early diagnostic tool for HSP pancreatitis. The patients with HSP who have abdominal pain as their chief complaint should be evaluated for pancreatitis, by routine serum amylase and abdominal computed tomography scan, to plan the specific treatment and avoid unnecessary surgery.
