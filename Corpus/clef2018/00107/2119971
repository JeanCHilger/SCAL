A retrospective study on diagnosis and treatment of severe acute pancreatitis. Severe acute pancreatitis is highly controversial on its diagnostic criteria, the optimum time for surgery, the selection of surgical procedures, and the prevention and treatment of complications. We treated 40 patients with severe acute pancreatitis from July 1983 to July 1988. The comparison of clinical and laboratory data of severe acute pancreatitis and mild acute pancreatitis showed that in some patients neither Ranson's nor Bank's criteria are reliable in classifying or predicting the severity of the disease. The coexistence of acute peritonitis and bloody ascites with elevated amylase level is very helpful to identify the local conditions of pancreatic necrosis and hemorrhage. We suggest early operation (within 48 hours) be applied in severe acute pancreatitis. In our series, five types of surgical procedures were used. We consider that proper treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is most important in the management of severe pancreatitis.
