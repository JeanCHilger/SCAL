A case of lupus-associated pancreatitis in Jamaica. Pancreatitis complicating a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is rarely reported in the literature and there are no known published cases thus far in the Caribbean. A 50-year old female diagnosed with SLE and discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) since 1990, presented in February, 2009, to the University Hospital of the West Indies (UHWI), Kingston, Jamaica, with symptoms suggestive of lupus pancreatitis. Serum amylase level was 2341 IU/L and serum lipase was 203 IU/L. Pancreatitis has a 3-8% rate of occurrence in adult patients with SLE. Aetiology and management of this entity remains controversial in these cases, but one must bear the diagnosis in mind, when faced with a SLE patient presenting with abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea.
