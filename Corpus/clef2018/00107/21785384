Lipid profile changes and importance of low serum Î±-lipoprotein fraction (high-density lipoprotein) in cases with acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a common systemic inflammatory disorder of the pancreas. The data related to the lipid changes in patients with AP were insufficient. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relation between high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and the other lipid parameters and the severity of the disease in AP cases.Seventy-five cases admitted to the Gastroenterohepatology Clinic with diagnosis of AP were included in the study. Ranson scores and Glasgow scores were used for prognosis. Lipid parameters were evaluated for the first 24 hours and after clinic and laboratory remission.The causes of the disease among patients included in the study were as follows: 44 biliary origin (58.7%), 14 alcohol dependent (18.7%), 10 idiopathic (13.3%), 6 hyperlipidemic (8%), and 1 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography dependent (1.3%). Triglyceride (TG) levels of the patients included in the study measured in the first 2 days were significantly higher than TG levels measured after clinic and laboratory remission (P = 0.013). High-density lipoprotein was significantly lower in alcoholic and hypertriglyceridemic AP cases. There was a statistical correlation between HDL and Ranson (P = 0.023).The low levels of HDL in AP cases during acute attack are associated with severity of the disease.
