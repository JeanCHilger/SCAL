Success rate and cannulation time between precut sphincterotomy and double-guidewire technique in truly difficult biliary cannulation. Precut sphincterotomy (PS) is usually indicated in failed standard biliary cannulation (BC). PS requires experienced endoscopists, and contains significant risk. Double-guidewire (DG) cannulation seems to be easier, and might be useful after failed standard BC. We aimed to compare cannulation time, success rate, and complication rates between the two techniques.Patients who failed standard BC within 10 min by the expert were defined as truly difficult BC and randomized into both groups. In the DG group, the first guidewire was left in the pancreatic duct, and then a catheter, pre-inserted with another guidewire, was used for the BC. In the PS group, a fistulotomy technique was used.From June 2008 to October 2009, 534 patients underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Forty-four patients (8.2%) who failed standard BC were randomized into the DG group (n = 23) and the PS group (n = 21). Median cannulation times and success rates in the DG and PS groups were 172 versus 394 s (P < 0.001), and 73.9% versus 80.9% (P = 0.724), respectively. The pancreatitis rate and serum amylase at 24 h in the DG and PS groups were 21.7% versus 14.3% (P = 0.701) and 937 versus 195 mg/dL (P = 0.020), respectively. Two from each group developed mild bleeding. No perforation occurred.In truly difficult BC, the DG technique requires a significant shorter duration for BC, with a comparable success rate to the PS technique. The post-procedure serum amylase level in the DG group was significantly higher, and there was a trend of more pancreatitis.
