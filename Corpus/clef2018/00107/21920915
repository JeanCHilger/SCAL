Specific immunoassay reveals increased serum trypsinogen 3 in acute pancreatitis. Trypsinogen 3 is a minor trypsinogen isoform in the pancreas. In contrast with trypsin 1 and 2, trypsin 3 degrades pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor, which may lead to an excess of active trypsin and acute pancreatitis (AP). We developed an immunoassay for trypsinogen 3 and studied whether an assay of serum trypsinogen 3 is of clinical utility in the diagnosis of AP.Monoclonal antibodies were generated using recombinant human trypsinogen 3 as the antigen and used to establish a sandwich-type immunoassay. We analyzed serum trypsinogen 3 concentrations in 82 patients with AP and 63 patients with upper abdominal pain (controls). The reference interval was determined using serum samples from 172 apparently healthy individuals.The measuring range of the trypsinogen 3 assay was 1.0-250 μg/L. Intra- and interassay CVs were <11%, and cross-reactivity with other trypsinogen isoenzymes was <0.1%. The median trypsinogen 3 concentration in serum from healthy individuals was <1.0 μg/L, and the upper reference limit was 4.4 μg/L. We observed increased trypsinogen 3 concentrations in patients with mild (median 9.5 μg/L) and severe (15.0 μg/L) AP in both groups, the concentrations were significantly higher than in controls (median <1.0 μg/L) (P < 0.0001). In ROC analysis, the area under the curve of trypsinogen 3 for separation between AP and controls was 0.90 (P < 0.0001).We established for the first time a specific immunoassay for trypsinogen 3 using monoclonal antibodies. Patients with AP were found to have increased serum concentrations of trypsinogen 3. The availability of this assay will be useful for studies of the clinical utility of trypsinogen 3.
