Oral administration of levan polysaccharide reduces the alloxan-induced oxidative stress in rats. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a polysaccharide named levan, which was produced by new isolated bacteria, on oxidative stress and hyperglycemia in alloxan-induced diabetic rats. Levan polysaccharide was given in drinking water for 60 days at a daily dose equivalent to 2%. The oral administration of levan in diabetic rats caused a decrease in glucose level in plasma and an increase of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activities in both pancreas and liver. Furthermore, a protective action against hepatic and pancreatic toxicity in diabetic rats was clearly observed. Furthermore, a significant decrease in hepatic and pancreatic indices toxicity was observed, i.e., alkalines phosphatases (ALP), aspartate and lactate transaminases (AST and ALT), lactate deshydrogenases (LDH) activities and the thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARs). These beneficial effects of levan were confirmed by histological findings in hepatic and pancreatic tissues of diabetic rats. This study demonstrates for the first time that levan is efficient in inhibiting hyperglycemia and oxidative stress induced by diabetes and suggests that administration of levan may be helpful in the prevention of diabetic complications associated with oxidative stress.
