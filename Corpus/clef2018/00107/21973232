Variations in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D during acute pancreatitis: an exploratory longitudinal study. We tested the hypothesis that 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25OHD) changes during acute inflammation in humans.Patients with first episode of acute pancreatitis were included. Blood samples were acquired on admission and on days 1, 2, and 14.In total, 73 patients (35 males, median age 59) entered the study. On admission, the distribution of 25-OHD levels was as follows: severely deficient (<13 nmol/L) 23% deficient (13-25 nmol/L) 20%The 25OHD levels dropped during the first 2 days of acute pancreatitis beyond what was expected based on 25OHD half-life. This study supports our hypothesis that an acute inflammatory condition utilizes 25OHD, but other mechanisms could interfere.
