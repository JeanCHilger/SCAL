Diagnosis and management of type I and type V hyperlipoproteinemia. Both type I and type V hyperlipoproteinemia are characterized by severe hypertriglyceridemia due to an increase in chylomicrons. Type I hyperlipoproteinemia is caused by a decisive abnormality of the lipoprotein lipase (LPL)- apolipoprotein C-II system, whereas the cause of type V hyperlipoproteinemia is more complicated and more closely related to acquired environmental factors. Since the relationship of hypertriglyceridemia with atherosclerosis is not as clear as that of hypercholesterolemia, and since type I and V hyperlipoproteinemia are relatively rare, few guidelines for their diagnosis and treatment have been established however, type I and V hyperlipoproteinemia are clinically important as underlying disorders of acute pancreatitis, and appropriate management is necessary to prevent or treat such complications. Against such a background, here we propose guidelines primarily concerning the diagnosis and management of type I and V hyperlipoproteinemia in Japanese.
