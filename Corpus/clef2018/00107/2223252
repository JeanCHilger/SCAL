A model of experimental acute pancreatitis in the conscious rat. We describe an experimental model of acute pancreatitis in conscious rats, based on biliary reflux sodium deoxycholate was injected while maintaining the common duct (biliary and pancreatic) temporally occluded. A progressive increase of serum amylase, cardiac rate and hematocrit value, as well as a decrease of plasma proteins are characteristic of this experimental model. Blood pressure was maintained until shortly before death, which occurred after 85 minutes. This is a simple model, reliable and reproducible, which requires minimal surgical manipulation.
