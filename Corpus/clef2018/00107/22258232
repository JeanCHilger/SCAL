Honokiol attenuates the severity of acute pancreatitis and associated lung injury via acceleration of acinar cell apoptosis. Severe acute pancreatitis remains a life-threatening disease with a high mortality rate among a defined proportion of those affected. Apoptosis has been hypothesized to be a beneficial form of cell death in acute pancreatitis. Honokiol, a low-molecular-weight natural product, possesses the ability of anti-inflammation and apoptosis induction. Here, we investigate whether honokiol can ameliorate severe acute pancreatitis and the associated acute lung injury in a mouse model. Mice received six injections of cerulein at 1-h intervals, then given one intraperitoneal injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharide for the induction of severe acute pancreatitis. Moreover, mice were intraperitoneally given vehicle or honokiol 10 min after the first cerulein injection. Honokiol protected against the severity of acute pancreatitis in terms of increased serum amylase and lipase levels, pancreas pathological injury, and associated acute lung injury. Honokiol significantly reduced the increases in serum tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin 1, and nitric oxide levels 3 h and serum high-mobility group box 1 24 h after acute pancreatitis induction. Honokiol also significantly decreased myeloperoxidase activities in the pancreas and the lungs. Endoplasmic reticulum stress-related molecules eIF2α (phosphorylated) and CHOP protein expressions, apoptosis, and caspase-3 activity were increased in the pancreas of mice with severe acute pancreatitis, which was unexpectedly enhanced by honokiol treatment. These results suggest that honokiol protects against acute pancreatitis and limits the spread of inflammatory damage to the lung in a severe acute pancreatitis mouse model. The acceleration of pancreatic cell apoptosis by honokiol may play a pivotal role.
