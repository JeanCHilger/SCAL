A pediatric case of an unusual type of annular pancreas presenting with duodenopancreatic reflux. Pancreatitis, a late complication of an annular pancreas (AP), results from coexisting pancreaticobiliary malformations including pancreas divisum (PD), and pancreaticobiliary maljunction (PBM). The authors report the case of a 3-year-old boy with an unusual type of AP in which the dorsal anlage encircled the duodenum. The patient developed duodenal obstruction as well as duodenopancreatic reflux with resulting hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia. This type of AP associated with duodenopancreatic reflux in AP has not been reported previously. The patient was successfully treated by duodenoduodenostomy, which, by correcting the duodenopancreatic reflux, prevented the later development of pancreatitis.
