Chemokine receptor CXCR3 is involved in the acute pancreatitis-associated lung injury. Acute pancreatitis is a common disease, which is divided into mild pancreatitis and severe pancreatitis. For the latter, a systemic inflammatory response may occur and lead to distant organ damage and the development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), which accounts for significant morbidity and mortality in humans. Chemokines and their receptors are being believed to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis. Chemokine receptor CXCR3 is reported to be involved in acute tissue injury, for example acute lung injury induced by cigarette smoking, but its role in acute pancreatitis is not yet known. In this study, two animal models of acute pancreatitis (cerulein- and arginine-induced pancreatitis) were applied in CXCR3⁻/⁻ mice and wild-type mice, in order to explore the role of CXCR3 in acute pancreatitis. Serum amylase, lipase and histological observations revealed that CXCR3 knockout did not affect the severity of acute pancreatitis. However, edema and inflammatory cell infiltrate in the lung tissue were attenuated in CXCR3⁻/⁻ mice when acute pancreatitis was induced. In conclusion, chemokine receptor CXCR3 is not involved in acute pancreatic injury, but has a connection with acute pancreatitis-associated lung injury. Acute pulmonary injury is attenuated in CXCR3 knockout mice in experimental acute pancreatitis.
