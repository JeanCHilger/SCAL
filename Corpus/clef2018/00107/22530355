Pancreatic injury during AAA repair: a comparison between EVAR and open repair. Enzymatic pancreatic injury (EPI) in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) treatment has been scarcely studied in the literature. Aim of this work was to compare perioperative EPI in AAA patients treated by endovascular repair (EVAR) or open repair (OR).Forty AAA patients consecutively treated with either EVAR (GI, 20 pts) or OR (GII, 20 pts) were prospectively evaluated in terms of epidemiology, comorbidities and technical details. Serum levels of amylase, lipase and pancreatic isoamylase were assessed before treatment (T0), before aortic clamping/endograft deployment (T1), 1, 2, and 6 hours after aortic declamping/endograft deployment (T2, T3, T4) and 24, 48, and 72 hours after the procedure (T5, T6, T7). GI and GII were compared by Mann Whitney test with significance set at p < 0.05.GI patients were significantly older and with higher frequency of preoperative renal insufficiency than GII ones (p = 0.001 and 0.047 respectively). Other characteristics were not significantly different. Pancreatic enzymes values at T0 were within normal parameters in all patients. Total serum amylase was significantly greater at T4 (p = 0.003), T5 (p = 0.010), T6 (p = 0.003), T7 (p = 0.011) and isoamylase at T3 (p = 0.052), T4 (p = 0.037), T5 (p = 0.016) and T6 (p = 0.014) in GII compared with GI. Amylase and isoamylase peak occurred 24 hours after the procedure. Lipase was significantly different in the two groups only in T4 (p = 0.028). No acute pancreatitis occurred in the whole study group.EVAR significantly reduces EPI compared with OR in the AAA treatment.
