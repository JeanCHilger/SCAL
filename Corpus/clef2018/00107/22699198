The risk for immediate postoperative complications after pancreaticoduodenectomy is increased by high frequency of acinar cells and decreased by prevalent fibrosis of the cut edge of pancreas. Soft pancreas is considered as a factor for pancreatitis after pancreaticoduodenectomy, which in turn constitutes a high risk for local complications. The aim was to analyze the proportion of different cell types in the cut edge of pancreas (CEP) in relation to postoperative pancreatitis and other complications after pancreaticoduodenectomy.Data from postoperative follow-up was collected on 40 patients who had undergone pancreaticoduodenectomy. Positive urine trypsinogen-2, an early detector of pancreatitis, was checked on days 1 to 6 after operation. Drain amylase was measured on postoperative day 3. Anastomotic leakages, delayed gastric emptying, and other complications were registered. The areas of different cell types were calculated from the entire hematoxylin-eosin-stained section of CEP.High frequency of acinar cells in the CEP significantly increased positive urine trypsinogen-2 days, drain amylase values, and delayed gastric emptying. In a subgroup of patients with more than 40% acini in the CEP, there were significantly more postoperative complications. Increased fibrosis correlated with a small number of positive urine trypsinogen-2 days and postoperative complications.A large number of acinar cells in the CEP increases, whereas extensive fibrosis in the CEP decreases, the risk for postoperative complications after pancreaticoduodenectomy. These results emphasize the importance of acini in the development of postoperative complications.
