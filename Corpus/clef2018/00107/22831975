The inhibitory effects of Nardostachys jatamansi on alcoholic chronic pancreatitis. Nardostachys jatamansi (NJ) belonging to the Valerianaceae family has been used as a remedy for gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases for decades. However, the potential for NJ to ameliorate alcoholic chronic pancreatitis (ACP) is unknown. The aim of this study was to examine the inhibitory effects of NJ on ACP. C57black/6 mice received ethanol injections intraperitoneally for 3 weeks against a background of cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis. During ACP, NJ was ad libitum administrated orally with water. After 3 weeks of treatment, the pancreas was harvested for histological examination. NJ treatment increased the pancreatic acinar cell survival (confirmed by amylase level testing) and reduced collagen deposition and pancreatic stellate cell (PSC) activation. In addition, NJ treatment reduced the activation but not death of PSC. In conclusion, our results suggest that NJ attenuated ACP through the inhibition of PSC activation.
