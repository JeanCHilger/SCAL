Effects of porcine pancreatic enzymes on the pancreas of hamsters. Part 2: carcinogenesis studies. Our previous study suggested that porcine pancreatic extract in hamsters with peripheral insulin resistance, normalizes insulin output, islet size and pancreatic DNA synthetic rate. It also inhibited the growth of human pancreatic cancer cells in nude mice.To examine the potential value of the porcine pancreatic extract in controlling pancreatic carcinogenesis in this model, the present experiment was performed.Hamsters were fed a high fat diet and four weeks later when insulin resistance emerges, they were divided into two groups. One group received 1 g/kg BW of porcine pancreatic extract in drinking water and the other group received tap water. One week later, when insulin output normalizes in porcine pancreatic extract-treated hamsters, a single subcutaneous injection of N-nitrosobis-(2-oxopropyl) amine (BOP) at a dose of 40 mg/kg BW was given to all hamsters. The experiment was terminated at 43 weeks after the porcine pancreatic extract treatment. The number and size of pancreatic tumors, blood glucose, insulin, amylase and lipase levels, the average size of islets and the number of insulin cells/islets were determined.The incidence of pancreatic cancer was significantly lower in the porcine pancreatic extract group (P=0.043), as well as the plasma insulin level and the size of the islets in the porcine pancreatic extract group were significantly lower (P&lt0.001) than in the control group. No significantly differences were found in the glucose level between the groups.These results show that porcine pancreatic extract has a potential to inhibit pancreatic cancer growth.
