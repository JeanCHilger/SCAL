Hyperamylasemia and pancreatitis following spiral enteroscopy. Acute pancreatitis is a significant potential complication with double-balloon enteroscopy. Hyperamylasemia is frequently observed after both double-balloon enteroscopy and single-balloon enteroscopy but often without associated pancreatitis. Whether the same phenomenon occurs with spiral enteroscopy is currently unknown.To determine the incidence of pancreatitis and hyperamylasemia following spiral enteroscopy.A prospective cohort study of consecutive patients undergoing proximal spiral enteroscopy was conducted. Serum amylase levels were measured immediately before and following the procedure, combined with observation for clinical signs of pancreatitis.A total of 32 patients underwent proximal spiral enteroscopy, with a mean total procedure time of 51 min (range 30 min to 100 min) and mean depth of insertion of 240 cm (range 50 cm to 350 cm). The diagnostic yield was 50%, with 31% of all procedures being therapeutic. While no patients exhibited signs that raised suspicion of pancreatitis, hyperamylasemia was common (20%). Hyperamylasemia was not significantly associated with procedure duration or depth of insertion but was linked to patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and with the use of propofol sedation, suggesting that it may be more common in difficult cases.Postprocedural hyperamylasemia occurred frequently with proximal spiral enteroscopy, while no associated pancreatitis was observed. This finding suggests that hyperamylasemia may not necessarily reflect pancreatic injury nor portend a risk for pancreatitis.
