New model of acute necrotizing pancreatitis induced by excessive doses of arginine in rats. We examined the biological and histologic characteristics of a new experimental model of acute necrotizing pancreatitis induced by excessive doses of arginine in rats. Rats were given a single intraperitoneal injection of 500 mg/100 g body weight of L-arginine. At 12-24 hr after the arginine injection, serum levels of amylase, lipase, and anionic trypsin(ogen) reached respective peak values 2, 5, and 20 times those of control rats without arginine and returned to control levels after 24-48 hr. The contents of pancreatic protein, DNA, and digestive enzymes were markedly reduced after the arginine injection and reached their nadirs at 72 hr. After 14 days these levels were almost normal. Histologic examination revealed a number of small vesicles within acinar cells at 6 hr, which were identified as markedly swollen mitochondria by the electron microscope. Other intracellular organelles and nuclei also showed degenerative changes. At 12 hr interstitial edema appeared, and acinar cell necrosis was seen after 24 hr. The extent and severity of necrotic changes of pancreatic exocrine tissue with inflammatory cell infiltration were maximal at 72 hr. At seven days, pancreatic acinar cells began to regenerate, and pancreatic architecture appeared almost normal after 14 days. The present study has demonstrated that the administration of excessive doses of arginine induces a new, noninvasive experimental model of acute necrotizing pancreatitis.
