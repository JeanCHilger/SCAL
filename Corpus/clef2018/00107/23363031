Efficacy of endoscopic nasobiliary drainage for the prevention of post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis and cholangitis after repeated clearance of common bile duct stones: experience from a Chinese center. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether it is reasonable to insert an endoscopic nasobiliary drainage (ENBD) tube in patients with endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST) and repeated clearance of common bile duct (CBD) stones.Patients with choledocholithiasis who underwent EST and CBD stone clearance at our center from January 2010 to May 2012 were reviewed. The following parameters were evaluated: (i) serum amylase 2 and 24 h after ERCP (ii) incidence of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)-related pancreatitis and cholangitisCompared with the no-ENBD group, the ENBD group presented a significantly lower postoperative serum amylase of 2 and 24 h (81.3 ± 31.8 U/L vs 90.8 ± 31.2 U/L, 107.0 ± 51.1 U/Lvs 132.3 ± 100.8 U/L, respectively). The incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis and cholangitis was also lower in the ENBD group, although the differences were not significant (1% vs 4.4%, 0 vs 4.5%, respectively). Time elapsed to normalization of total serum bilirubin levels and length of hospital stay was shorter in the ENBD group (4.3 days ± 0.6 days vs 4.5 days ± 0.7 days, P > 0.05 4.8 days ± 2.1 days vs 6.3 days ± 2.8 days, respectively, P < 0.01).ENBD significantly reduces the incidence of hyperamylasemia and decreases the length of hospital stay in patients with EST and repeated stone extraction. ENBD should be considered for patients with large or multiple CBD stones.
