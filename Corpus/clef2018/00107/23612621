Roux-en-Y biliary by-pass - a new approach in the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia induced recurrent acute pancreatitis. Clinical case study. Acute pancreatitis is a disease with significant mortality. Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is the third most common etiological factor of this disorder after alcohol and gall-stones. The authors presented a case of 42-years old caucasian female who was hospitalized due to recurrence of acute pancreatitis. She had been diagnosed with HTG. She had earlier seven episodes of acute pancreatitis. Endoscopic papillotomy and conservatory treatment didn't change her complaints and she was consented for surgery. Exclusion of distal part of bile duct was performed. The common bile duct was anastomosed side-to-side to the 70 cm long Roux loop of the jejunum with the ligation of the distal part of the common bile duct. Following the surgery authors observed normalization of amylase, lipase, leukocytosis and CRP levels. During six months after procedure patient didn't have any new episode of pancreatitis. Exclusion of distal part of bile duct may be a useful tool in surgical treatment of recurrent acute hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis.
