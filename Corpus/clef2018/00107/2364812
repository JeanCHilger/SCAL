Diagnosis and treatment of severe pancreatitis: analysis of 40 cases. Forty cases of severe pancreatitis confirmed and treated by surgery were studied. In order to have a retrospective observation, we compared the clinical and laboratory data of 28 severe cases with that of 72 mild cases treated conservatively and found that in some cases neither Ranson nor Bank criteria were reliable in predicting the severity. We also found that frank peritonitis and bloody ascites with elevated amylase level were very good indication of pancreatic necrosis and hemorrhage. It was the author's opinion to explore early within 48 hrs after onset, using both drainage and open lesser sac lavage in most severe cases of pancreatitis.
