Comparative study of secretin and Lundh tests. Exocrine pancreatic function in 19 patients with pancreatic disease and in 14 of 16 controls was measured by secretin stimulation and by the Lundh test on two different occasions. Peak bicarbonate concentration in the Lundh test emerged as the most reliable parameters. No additional diagnostic value was obtained by measuring enzymes after secretin injection. In 6 patients with chronic and in 8 of 13 patients with acute pancreatitis, both tests gave results that agreed with each other. The remaining 5 patients showed either an abnormal secretin value or an abnormal Lundh test. This is consistent with the wide variation seen in acute pancreatitis. It is concluded that the Lundh test as well as the secretin test were of value in the assessment of chronic pancreatic disease. The secretin test may be slightly more sensitive to mild and acute pancreatic damage than is the Lundh test. However stimulation of the pancreas by a test meal is easier to perform and more economic.
