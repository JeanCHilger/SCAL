Increased urinary levels of thyrotropin-releasing hormone immunoreactivity in acute pancreatitis. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) has been shown to be present and have actions in the human gastrointestinal tract. We have studied urine TRH immunoreactivity (TRH-ir) levels in healthy subjects and patients with acute pancreatitis, gallstones, ulcerative colitis, or acute gastritis. The urine samples were prepurified by SP-Sephadex-C-25 cation exchange chromatography, subjected to reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography, and assayed in our TRH radioimmunoassay. The mean urine TRH immunoreactivity values of healthy subjects were 4.42 +/- 1 ng/l (x +/- SEM) of patients with acute pancreatitis on the 1st day of hospitalization, 23 +/- 7 ng/l
