Experimental study of respiratory failure with acute pancreatitis in dogs. In this experimental study, we investigated pathophysiology of respiratory failure with acute pancreatitis. Pancreatitis was induced by injection of 15% Na-taurocholate 1 ml/kg into the main pancreatic duct of the dogs. Experimental dogs were divided into two groups based on the value of Respiratory Index (R-Index). Group A included 9 dogs in whom respiratory failure was not recognized (R-Index less than 0.5) and Group B included 9 dogs with respiratory failure (R-Index less than 0.5). All the dogs were sacrificed 12 hours after induction of pancreatitis, and histological findings were examined. Quantity of water in the lung (Qwl) was also measured by gravimetric method. Group B showed severe hypoxia with hypocapnia, and increase of A-aDO2, R-Index, and decrease of a/A PO2. Qwl in Group B increased significantly comparing with Group A. In biochemical study, increase of serum lipase, triglyceride, free fatty acid, and angiotensin converting enzyme were observed in Group B. These results indicate that respiratory failure with acute pancreatitis is due to lung edema following injury of the capillary of the lung. The role of free fatty acid liberated by lipolysis was suggested in the mechanism of pulmonary damage with acute pancreatitis.
