Impact of hyperglycemia and acute pancreatitis on the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts. Since hyperglycemia aggravates acute pancreatitis and also activates the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) in other organs, we explored if RAGE is expressed in the pancreas and if its expression is regulated during acute pancreatitis and hyperglycemia. Acute pancreatitis was induced by cerulein in untreated and streptozotocin treated diabetic mice. Expression of RAGE was analyzed by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. To evaluate signal transduction the phosphorylation of ERK1/ERK2 was assessed by Western blot and the progression of acute pancreatitis was monitored by evaluation of lipase activity and the pancreas wet to dry weight ratio. RAGE is mainly expressed by acinar as well as interstitial cells in the pancreas. During acute pancreatitis infiltrating inflammatory cells also express RAGE. Using two distinct anti-RAGE antibodies six RAGE proteins with diverse molecular weight are detected in the pancreas, whereas just three distinct RAGE proteins are detected in the lung. Hyperglycemia, which aggravates acute pancreatitis, significantly reduces the production of two RAGE proteins in the inflamed pancreas.
