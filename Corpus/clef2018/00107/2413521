Studies on the plasma kallikrein-kinin system in peritoneal exudate and plasma during experimental acute pancreatitis in pigs. Acute pancreatitis was induced in pigs by retrograde injection of Na-taurocholate into the pancreatic duct. By means of chromogenic peptide substrate assays, increased plasma kallikrein activity, parallel with a reduction of plasma prekallikrein and functional kallikrein inhibition values, was found in peritoneal exudate. In plasma, however, no changes in the kallikrein-kinin system were found during the 6-h observation time. The study demonstrates the presence of components of the plasma kallikrein-kinin system in peritoneal fluid and suggests that the peritoneal cavity to a great extent is a functionally separate compartment from plasma. Activation of the plasma kallikrein-kinin system in peritoneal exudate during acute experimental pancreatitis appears to be of importance for the initial symptoms and the development of shock seen during this condition.
