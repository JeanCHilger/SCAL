Effect of new oligopeptide inhibitors of elastase on acute experimental pancreatitis in the rat. Acute experimental pancreatitis was induced in male Wistar rats by retrograde injection of 0.4 ml 2% sodium taurocholate into the common choledochopancreatic duct. Prophylactic intraperitoneal injection of 20 mg glutaryl-trialanine-ethylamide, Glt-(Ala)3-NH-Et, 30 min. before induction of pancreatitis reduced the amount of fat necroses and the activity of amylase and lipase in ascites. Repeated intraperitoneal injection of this inhibitor decreased pancreatic hemorrhage. Simultaneous administration of 20 mg Glt-(Ala)3-NH-Et intraperitoneally, and 10 000 KIU of aprotinin intravenously was followed by the most extensive inhibitory effect. Prophylactic and repeated administration of both inhibitors also reduced the area of pancreatic hemorrhage. The same mode of administration of 20 mg undecenoyl-aspartyl-dialanyl-proline-ethylamide, UDE-Asp-(Ala)2-Pro-NH-Et, intraperitoneally and 20 000 KIU of aprotinin intramuscularly, resulted in selective inhibition of fat necroses in all localizations. Glt-(Ala)3-NH-Et and UDE-Asp-(Ala)2-Pro-NH-Et are considered effective inhibitors of various macroscopic and biochemical signs of acute pancreatitis in the rat during short-ferm experiments, if administered prophylactically or early after induction of the disease.
