Value of biochemical and imaging procedures for the diagnosis and prognosis of acute pancreatitis--results of a prospective clinical study. For a period of 14 days we carried out measurements for alpha-1-protease inhibitor, alpha-2-macroglobulin, complement C 3, complement C 4, and C-reactive protein in two different groups of patients with acute pancreatitis. Group I consisted of 13 patients with edematous-interstitial pancreatitis and group II of 22 patients with necrotizing pancreatitis. Diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was established by clinical signs and symptoms, by specific pancreatic enzymes determined in the serum, by imaging procedures, and by laparotomy in 24 cases. The overall detection rate for pancreatic necrosis was 90% for the contrast enhanced CT and 33% for ultrasonography respectively. There were significant differences as to all measured serum parameters between the two morphologically defined pancreatitis groups. The necrosis detection rate was 95% for CRP and 85% for alpha-2-macroglobulin. The combined determination of CRP and alpha-2-macroglobulin is recommended in patients with acute pancreatitis to stage the severity of the disease and to probably replace the CT investigation.
