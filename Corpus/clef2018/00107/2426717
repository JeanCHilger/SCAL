Pancreatic duct occlusion in the rat: report and assessment of a new technique. Temporary reduction of the exocrine pancreatic secretion may be desirable in various experimental models. In the rat this can be achieved by obstructing the connection between the pancreas and the duodenum. A new, simple technique of pancreatic duct occlusion using metal hemostatic clips is described. The reduction of secretion produced by the procedure was assessed by measuring duodenal protein, amylase, and trypsin during stimulation with cholecystokinin. Stimulated duodenal amylase activity 1 and 4 weeks following duct occlusion was reduced by approximately 80% compared with sham-operated controls, whereas proteolytic activity was reduced by 96 and 60%, respectively. The magnitude and duration of pancreatic insufficiency achieved by this technique is equivalent to that achieved with more complicated methods.
