Opuntia humifusa ameliorated cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of Opuntia humifusa (OH) on cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis (AP).Acute pancreatitis was induced via intraperitoneal injection of cholecystokinin analog cerulein (50 Î¼g/kg). In the OH pretreatment group, OH was administered intraperitoneally (100, 250, or 500 mg/kg) 1 hour before first cerulein injection. In the posttreatment group, OH was administered intraperitoneally (500 mg/kg) 1 hour after the first cerulein injection. Furthermore, we isolated the pancreatic acinar cells using collagenase method, then investigated the acinar cell viability, cytokine productions, and the regulating mechanisms.The both pretreatment and posttreatment of OH treatment attenuated the severity of AP, as shown by the histology of the pancreas and lung, and inhibited neutrophil infiltration serum amylase and lipase activitiesThese results suggest that OH reduces the severity of AP by inhibiting acinar cell death through c-Jun N-terminal kinases.
