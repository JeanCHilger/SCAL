Role of pancreatic duct occlusion with prolamine (Ethibloc) in necrotizing pancreatitis. There is evidence that the pancreatic duct plays an important role in the evolution of necrotizing pancreatitis. We hypothesized that occlusion of the pancreatic duct and its smaller ductules with prolamine (Ethibloc) in opossums at risk of severe necrotizing pancreatitis would have a beneficial effect on the progression of the disease. Sixteen opossums underwent bile duct ligation below the entrance of the pancreatic duct. They were divided into four groups at 6 days. Group I (control, n = 5) opossums were killed for histologic observation of the degree of necrosis of the pancreas group II (n = 5) underwent external drainage of the pancreatic biliary duct
