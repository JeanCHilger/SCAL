Rutin rich Emblica officinalis Geart. fruit extract ameliorates inflammation in the pancreas of rats subjected to alcohol and cerulein administration. The modulating effect of methanolic extract of Emblica officinalis (MEEO) on ethanol (EtOH)- and cerulein (Cer)-induced pancreatitis in rats was investigated in this study.Male albino Wistar rats were divided into four groups. Group 1 and 2 rats served as control and fed normal diet. Group 3 and 4 rats were fed isocalorically adjusted diet containing EtOH (36% of total calories) for 5 weeks and also subjected to intraperitoneal injection of Cer 20 µg/kg b.wt. thrice weekly for the last 3 weeks of the experimental period. In addition, group 2 and 4 rats received 200 mg/kg b.wt. of MEEO from 15th day till the experimental period. Serum levels of lipase (L), amylase (A), cytokines IL-1β, IL-18, caspase-1 and oxidative stress index (OSI) were determined. Levels of fecal trypsin, total collagen, caspase-1, myeloperoxidase (MPO), antioxidants and mRNA expression of caspase-1, IL-1β and IL-18 were determined in the pancreas.HPLC analysis showed the presence of rutin in MEEO. We observed a significant elevation in serum L/A ratio, IL-1β, IL-18, caspase-1, OSI, collagen, MPO activity and the mRNA expression of IL-1β, IL-18 and caspase-1 and significant reduction in fecal trypsin and antioxidant status in EtOH- and Cer-administered rats. The inflammatory markers were found to be reduced and the antioxidant status of pancreas was maintained in MEEO-coadministered rats.The rutin rich nature of E. officinalis can be claimed for its anti-inflammatory and pancreato protective effects.
