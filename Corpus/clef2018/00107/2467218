Serum lipase and amylase levels in chronic renal failure: interpretation of results--effects of extrarenal purification. Serum amylase and lipase activities were studied in two groups of patients without clinical evidence of pancreatitis: 47 with stable chronic renal failure, 61 treated by haemodialysis. Amylase activity was significantly increased in 73 of 108 patients (68%) and lipase activity in 67 of 108 (62%). After dialysis, both enzymatic activities were decreased, despite of the lack of extraction by the artificial kidney. Laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis of pancreatitis is difficult in patients with chronic renal failure, and cannot be supported only by serum amylase and lipase activity measurements.
