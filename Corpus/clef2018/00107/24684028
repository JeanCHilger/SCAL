Comparison of biohumoral and morphological parameters in acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis occurs as a result of autodigestive activation of pancreatic proenzymes, within the parenchyma of the glands.The goal of the work was to establish possible connection of etiology and severity of the acute pancreatitis and biohumoral parameters, ultrasound and CT.The study included 273 patients with pancreatitis, classified by Ranson's score, according to degree of severity and etiology, whose biohumoral parameters were correlated with each other, and with the ultrasound and CT findings.The values of amylase and ALT were significantly higher in the severe form of pancreatitis and biliary etiology compared to etilic (p < 0.05).The ratio of AST/ALT was significantly higher in the group of etilic compared to biliary etiology (p < 0.05). LDH was significantly higher in the severe form group compared to moderate form of pancreatitis (p < 0.01). Cholesterol was significantly higher in the group of biliary compared to the group of etilic pancreatitis (p < 0.05). There was a negative low correlation between the value of calcium ions in the plasma and CT analysis (p = 0.05). Low degree negative correlation between the value of calcium ions and ultrasound analysis was established (p = 0.0001).There was a negative correlation between the level of ionized calcium in the blood and the degree of the acute pancreatitis by the Balthazar score. Mean value of alpha amylase, total value of cholesterol and ALT were significantly higher in the group of biliary compared to the group of etilic acute pancreatitis. The average values of the alpha amylase, LDH and ALT were significantly higher in the group of severe form of the acute pancreatitis compared to the group of moderate form. The ratio AST/ALT was significantly higher in the group of etilic than in the group of biliary pancreatitis.
