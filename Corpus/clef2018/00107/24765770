Ultrasonographic diagnosis of acute pancreatitis caused by ruptured hydatid disease to the biliary system. Acute pancreatitis is a rare complication of hydatic disease which occurs following the rupture of a cyst to the intrahepatic bile ducts. Herein, we report a case of a 34-year-old Turkish man, who presented with upper abdominal pain. In laboratory examination, amylase and lipase levels were elevated. Ultrasound examination showed a cystic hypoechoic mass lesion located in the right lobe of the liver with dilated intrahepatic bile ducts, and germinative membranes were detected originating from the ruptured hydatid cyst to the common bile duct. The pancreas was found to be diffusely hypoechoic, consistent with acute pancreatitis. Contrast enhanced CT and MRI were also performed for further evaluation of the primary lesion and its complications.
