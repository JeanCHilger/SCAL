Exocrine pancreas in rabbits fed a copper-deficient diet: structural and functional studies. The effects of a copper-deficient diet supplemented with D-penicillamine on both the structure and exocrine function of the pancreas were studied in rabbits. The pancreases of the animals kept on this diet for 13 weeks showed lesions in the acinar tissue but not in ductal or islet tissue. The weights of the glands were markedly reduced. Copper deficiency caused a slight (non-significant) reduction in the flow of pancreatic juice and in sodium output and significantly decreased chloride output (p less than 0.01). No changes were observed in bicarbonate and potassium output. Total protein and amylase secretions were maintained at clearly detectable levels in pancreatic juice, although they decreased significantly (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.001, respectively), in the copper-deficient animals compared with the controls. The pancreases of the animals kept on a copper-deficient diet were seen to maintain their capacity for response to secretin, cholecystokinin (CCK), and bethanechol. Our results show that rabbit pancreatic acinar tissue is less sensitive to copper deficiency than that of other species studied. Additionally, the data on secretion of water and electrolytes suggest that in the rabbit the acinar cells may contribute to the secretory process with a chloride-rich fluid.
