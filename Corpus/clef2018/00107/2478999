Activation of proteases in cerulein-induced pancreatitis. The activation of zymogen proteases and lysosomal enzyme cathepsin B in the pancreas was investigated in cerulein-induced pancreatitis in rats. Acute pancreatitis was induced by two intraperitoneal injections of 40 micrograms/kg of body weight of cerulein at intervals of 1 h. After the first cerulein injection, the active trypsin and elastase contents in the pancreas tissues significantly increased, and reached the highest level at 3 h after the first injection, followed by peaks at 5 h in the serum amylase and lipase levels and the pancreas wet weight. Cathepsin B contents in pancreas tissues showed a parallel increase with active zymogen enzymes during the first 3 h of pancreatitis. These findings may suggest that the intracellular activation of trypsinogen is an important step in the development of cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis and that cathepsin B plays a role in the activation of trypsinogen in pancreatic acinar cells.
