Role of the kallikrein-kinin system in human pancreatitis. Various factors in the kallikrein-kinin system were evaluated in acute and chronic pancreatitis. It was noted in particular that plasma trypsin and glandular kallikrein increased markedly in acute phase of pancreatitis and its correlation with amylase was observed. Plasma prekallikrein (PPK) decreased in acute pancreatitis, but increased in chronic pancreatitis. A negative correlation was noted between PPK and kallikrein like activity. Both HMW and LMW kininogen decreased in acute pancreatitis. It was presumed from these findings that the increase in kinin and its activation at the acute phase of pancreatitis might be due to kallikrein or trypsin originating from the pancreas.
