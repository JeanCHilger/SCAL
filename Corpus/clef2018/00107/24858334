Determination of hepatocyte growth factor at early phase of acute pancreatitis. The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic value of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) as a new predictor of severity in patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) at early phase of disease.The studied group involved 40 patients (16 women and 24 men) with AP admitted to Ist Dept. of Surgery Jagiellonian University Medical College in Krakow. Twenty-four patients had mild and twelve severe form of AP. Glasgow and Imrie scores were calculated to evaluate severity of AP. HGF concentrations were measured by ELISA (R&D Systems) on days 1, 3 and 5 after admission within 48 hours after onset of symptoms.Serum median concentrations of HGF was significantly higher in patients with severe versus mild clinical course of AP on each of the study days (7.61 vs 3.30 ng/mL, p = 0.05 on day 1 7.19 vs 3.43, p = 0.04 on day 3 and 5.76 vs 2.42, p = 0.02 on day 5). HGF positively correlated with Glasgow and Imrie scores (R = 0.57 and R = 0.51). HGF negatively correlated with fetuin A, a negative acute phase protein (R = -0.60 on day 3 and R = -0.45 on day 5) and positively with CRP (R = 0.93Serum HGF correlates with several inflammatory markers and clinical scores (Glasgow, Imrie) in patients with AP and may be considered a new promising tool in assessing the severity of acute pancreatitis.
