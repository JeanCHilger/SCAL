Myocarditis, pancreatitis, polyarthritis, mononeuritis multiplex and vasculitis with symmetrical peripheral gangrene of the lower extremities as a rare presentation of leptospirosis: a case report and review of the literature. Leptospirosis is a zoonosis caused by the spirochete, Leptospira interrogans. While most cases of leptospirosis are mild to moderate, the course may be complicated by multiorgan dysfunction. We present a rare case of leptospirosis with acute myocarditis, pancreatitis, polyarthritis, mononeuritis multiplex and severe vasculitis with necrosis of the extremities.A 32-year-old man from Congo presented with high-grade fever, confusion and headache. He developed tachycardia and hypotension followed by electrocardiogram changes and elevation of troponin I levels suggesting myocarditis. A physical examination revealed conjunctival suffusion, polyarthritis of his lower extremities and cutaneous necrosis of his feet due to vasculitis. Laboratory findings included amylase levels 10-fold the upper normal serum levels and thrombocytopenia. The diagnosis was confirmed by a positive leptospira immunoglobulin M, negative immunoglobulin G and a positive rapid agglutination test. Our patient recovered progressively with antimicrobials and supportive care.Because the clinical features and diagnostic findings of leptospirosis are not specific, a high index of suspicion must be maintained for the diagnosis. Serology is the most important tool for accurate and quick diagnosis in order to administer the appropriate therapy.
