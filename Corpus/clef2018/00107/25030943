Effect of diclofenac on the levels of lipoxin A4 and Resolvin D1 and E1 in the post-ERCP pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis is one of the most common complications of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Numerous studies have shown that administered nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may reduce the incidence of acute pancreatitis after ERCP. Little is known, however, about the mechanism of NSAIDs in preventing pancreatitis (PEP).In this study, we assigned patients to receive a single dose of intramuscular diclofenac 75 mg immediately after ERCP (diclofenac group) or without (control group). The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of PEP. The serum amylase levels were measured before ERCP and at 3 and 24 h post-procedure in all patients. The Lipoxin A4 (LXA4), Resolvin D1 (Rvd1), and Resolvin E1 (RvE1) levels were measured before ERCP, and 3 and 24 h after the procedure in 30 patients from the diclofenac group and 30 patients from the control group.A total of 120 patients were enrolled and completed the follow-up. The overall incidence of PEP was 13.3% (16/120). It occurred in four of 60 patients (6.67%) in the diclofenac group and in 12 of 60 patients (20.00%) in the control group (p = 0.032). The LxA4, RvD1, and RvE1 levels in the diclofenac group at 3 h after ERCP were significantly increased compared with before ERCP (p < 0.05). Compared with the control group, the LxA4, RvD1, and RvE1 levels in the diclofenac group at 3 and 24 h after ERCP were significantly increased (p < 0.05).Intramuscular diclofenac after ERCP can reduce the incidence of PEP. This may be related to the fact that diclofenac can increase the levels of LxA4, RvD1, and RvE1.
