Mesenchymal stem cells improve intestinal integrity during severe acute pancreatitis. Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) is an acute inflammatory disease of the pancreas that involves various distant tissues and organs. This study aimed to investigate post-tissue injury repair by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in a rat model of SAP. A total of 54 pathogen-free adult male SD rats were randomly assigned to the groups SAP, SAP + MSCs and sham-operated (SO). SAP was induced by 4% sodium taurocholate, and MSCs were injected via the dorsal penile vein 1 h later. The amylase activity, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and diamine oxidase (DAO) levels were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), while the expression of aquaporin (AQP)-1 was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining. The pathological score of intestinal tissues was also compared among groups. Marked improvement in intestinal necrosis, villi shedding and infiltration of inflammatory cells was observed in the SAP + MSCs group compared to the SAP and SO groups. Amylase, TNF-α, and DAO levels were significantly increased in the SAP + MSCs group. The intestinal expression of AQP-1 was increased at 12 and 24 h post-MSC transplantation compared to the SO group. Rats of the SAP + MSCs group displayed higher pathological scores compared to the SAP group at all time points. Overall, these data showed that MSCs can inhibit systemic inflammation and reduce TNF-α release in a rat model of SAP-induced intestinal injury, suggesting that MSCs exert protective effects on the intestinal barrier during SAP.
