The predictive value of proteinuria in acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis has a highly variable clinical course. Early and reliable predictors for the severity of acute pancreatitis are lacking. Proteinuria appears to be a useful predictor of disease severity and outcome in a variety of clinical conditions. This study aims to investigate the predictive value of proteinuria on admission for the severity of acute pancreatitis compared with other commonly used predictors the APACHE II score, Modified Glasgow score and C-reactive protein (CRP).This is a post-hoc analysis of 64 patients admitted with acute pancreatitis treated in one teaching hospital, who participated in a previous randomized trial. Proteinuria was defined as a Protein/Creatinine (P/C) ratio >23 mg/mmol. The primary endpoint was severe acute pancreatitis. Secondary endpoints included infectious complications, need for invasive intervention, ICU stay and in-hospital mortality.Proteinuria was present in 30/64 patients (47%). Eleven patients (17%) had severe acute pancreatitis. There was no difference in incidence of severe acute pancreatitis between patients with and without proteinuria: 6/30 patients (20%) versus 5/34 patients (15%) respectively (p = 0.58). Likewise, the occurrence of infectious complications, need for intervention and ICU stay and mortality did not differ significantly (p = 0.58, p = 0.99, p = 0.33 and p = 0.60 respectively). The diagnostic performance of the P/C ratio for the prediction of severe pancreatitis was inferior to the Modified Glasgow score (p = 0.04) and CRP (p = 0.03).Proteinuria on admission does not seem to be a reliable predictor for disease severity in acute pancreatitis. The diagnostic performance of the P/C ratio is inferior to the Modified Glasgow score and CRP.
