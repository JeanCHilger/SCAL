Hydroalcohol extract of Trigonella foenum-graecum seed attenuates markers of inflammation and oxidative stress while improving exocrine function in diabetic rats. The herb fenugreek, Trigonella foenum-graecum Linn (Fabaceae), seeds have been traditionally used in the treatment of diabetes but its effect on oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the improvement of exocrine function of diabetes has not been studied. The effect of hydroalcoholic extract of Trigonella foenum-graecum seeds (HEF) on alloxan-induced type-II diabetic rat model was investigated.Effect of HEF (500, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg), glimepiride (4 mg/kg), and combination of HEF (500 mg/kg) + glimepiride (2 mg/kg), on alloxan-induced diabetic rats was evaluated by assaying (blood glucose, serum protein, glycosylated hemoglobin, muscle and liver glycogen, glucose uptake by diaphragm, liver glucose transport, serum pancreatic enzymes (α-amylase, lipase), pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6), antioxidant enzymes [glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD)], lipid peroxides (liver and pancreas), and histoarchitecture (liver, pancreas).Treatment with HEF (at different doses), glimepiride, and HEF + glimepiride increased body weight and glucose uptake, reduced plasma glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, liver glucose transport, pro-inflammatory cytokines, pancreatic enzymes and restored depleted glycogen (muscle, liver) and total protein significantly (p < 0.01) and dose dependently, including prevention of lipid peroxidation and restoration of GSH and SOD (liver and pancreas). Treatment with HEF + glimepiride potentiated hypoglycemic activity of glimepiride. Histoarchitecture of liver and pancreas showed marked improvement.Present experimental findings suggest that HEF possesses promising hypoglycemic activity, presumably by amelioration of oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory cytokines. HEF may be useful as an adjuvant with clinically effective antidiabetic drugs in the management of type-II diabetes.
