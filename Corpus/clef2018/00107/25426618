C-reactive protein may influence decisively the prescription of prophylactic antibiotics in acute pancreatitis: a population-based cohort study. Prescription of prophylactic antibiotics in acute pancreatitis (AP) is controversial. We aimed to identify the patients' characteristics that may prompt clinicians to prescribe prophylactic antibiotics in AP.This single-center retrospective cohort study included 299 consecutive patients with AP from a Portuguese hospital in 2009 to 2010. Logistic regression was used to study the association of patients' characteristics with prescription of prophylactic antibiotics in AP.Persistent organ failure developed in 7% of patients (9/136). The median C-reactive protein at 48 hours after hospital admission was 154 mg/L (interquartile range, 55-271 mg/L). Bedside Index for Severity in AP score greater than or equal to 3 occurred in 14% of patients (42/299). Pancreatic necrosis was diagnosed in 21% of the patients (35/169). Computerized Tomography Severity Index score greater than 3 occurred in 23% of patients (38/169). In-hospital mortality rate was 4% (10/299). Prophylactic antibiotics were prescribed to 14% of patients (42/299). After adjusting for persistent organ failure and Computerized Tomography Severity Index score greater than 3, C-reactive protein at 48 hours after hospital admission greater than or equal to 150 mg/L was significantly associated with higher likelihood of receiving prophylactic antibiotics (odds ratio, 12.2). Prophylactic antibiotics did not improve in-hospital mortality rate (P = 0.637).C-reactive protein was the most influential in prescribing prophylactic antibiotics in AP. Clinicians may need better tools to support the decision to prescribe prophylactic antibiotics in AP.
