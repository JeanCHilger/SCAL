Retrospective analysis of fixed dose rate infusion of gemcitabine and S-1 combination therapy (FGS) as salvage chemotherapy in patients with gemcitabine-refractory advanced pancreatic cancer: inflammation-based prognostic score predicts survival. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of fixed dose rate infusion of gemcitabine and S-1 combination therapy (FGS) in patients with gemcitabine (GEM)-refractory pancreatic cancer (PC) and to explore independent variables associated with survival.We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients with GEM-refractory PC who received FGS at our institution from March 2009 to December 2013. GEM was administered by fixed dose rate intravenous infusion of 1,200 mg/m(2) as a 120-min infusion on day 1, and S-1 was administered orally twice a day at a dose of 40 mg/m(2) on days 1-7. Cycles were repeated every 14 days.Sixty-one patients with GEM-refractory PC received FGS. Sixteen patients received FGS as third-line treatment. Twenty-nine patients (48 %) had a history of S-1 administration. The objective response rate was 13 %, and the disease control rate was 49 %. The median progression-free survival time was 2.7 months, and the median overall survival time was 6.0 months. Major Grade 3 or 4 adverse events included neutropenia (15 %), diarrhea (3 %), anorexia (2 %), and fatigue (2 %). A high inflammation-based prognostic score (modified Glasgow prognostic score (mGPS), which incorporates C-reactive protein and albumin), a performance status >0, and serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 level >2,000 IU/ml were independently associated with a poor outcome.FGS might be effective and well tolerated as salvage chemotherapy in a practical setting. The inflammation-based prognostic score is a simple and reliable indicator of survival in the setting of salvage chemotherapy.
