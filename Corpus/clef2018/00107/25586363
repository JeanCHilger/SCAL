Canine pancreatic-specific lipase concentrations in dogs with heart failure and chronic mitral valvular insufficiency. Chronic mitral valvular insufficiency (CMVI) in dogs is very common and might cause clinical signs of congestion and poor tissue perfusion.Poor tissue perfusion from CMVI causes pancreatitis in dogs, as indicated by serum pancreatic lipase concentrations.Sixty-two client-owned dogs consisting of 40 dogs with different stages of heart failure from CMVI and 22 age-matched healthy dogs, based on full cardiac exam and routine laboratory tests.Prospective, controlled, observational study. Serum canine pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (cPLI) concentrations were determined by quantitative cPLI test in healthy and CMVI groups.Serum cPLI concentrations were 54.0 μg/L (IQR: 38.0-78.8 μg/L) in control, 55.0 μg/L (IQR: 38.3-88.8 μg/L) in ISACHC I, 115.0 μg/L (IQR: 45.0-179.0 μg/L) in ISACHC II and 223.0 μg/L (IQR: 119.5-817.5 μg/L) in ISACHC III. Close correlation to serum cPLI concentration was found in the left atrial to aorta (LA/Ao) ratio (r = 0.597 P = .000) and the severity of heart failure (r = 0.530This study found CMVI is associated with pancreatic injury in congestive heart failure caused by CMVI. Therefore, periodic monitoring on cPLI could be useful in monitoring dogs in heart failure.
