Renal tubular dysfunction in pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis. Urinary excretion of alpha-glucosidase (AGL), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and ribonuclease (RNase), and serum amylase and immunoreactive trypsin (IRT) were determined in 38 control subjects, 48 patients with pancreatic cancer, 77 with chronic pancreatitis and 47 with extrapancreatic diseases in order to ascertain the presence of a renal tubular damage and to investigate its etiology. A significantly increased frequency of pathological results for all urinary enzymes was documented in the various groups of patients as compared to controls. Significant correlations were detected among AGL, GGT and RNase. Considering the subjects as a whole, GGT and RNase excretions correlated with serum IRT and amylase the two urinary enzymes were found to be higher when jaundice was present. In chronic pancreatic disease enzymuria was related to increased serum pancreatic enzymes
