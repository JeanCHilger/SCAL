5-Fluorouracil (ftorafur) in the treatment of acute pancreatitis. Indications for and efficacy of its use. The main aim of the complex medical treatment in acute pancreatitis is the inhibition of exocrine pancreas secretion and decrease or annulment of the proteolytic effect, of autolysis, of its enzymes, both on the gland itself and on the neighbouring tissues. The authors introduced cytostatics of the 5-fluorouracil type (ftorafur) in the medical and/or medico-surgical treatment of 30 cases of acute pancreatitis admitted to the "Caritas" Surgical Clinic, during 1986-1987. The drugs lead to DNA-RNA inhibition and reduce significantly the pancreatic exocrine activity. Efficiency of 5-fluorouracil within the other therapeutic methods is proved by the results obtained, especially by the favourable rapid clinical evolution, blood amylase normalization in 48-72 hours, arrest in evolution of the pancreatic lesions. The treatment is economical and has no side effects. It may be also used for the digestive fistulae with pancreatic content or for the pure pancreatic fistulae.
