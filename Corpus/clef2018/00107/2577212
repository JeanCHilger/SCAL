Enzymatic diagnosis of alcoholism-induced damage of internal organs. ++Post-alcoholic lesion of liver, pancreas, and heart muscle was estimated by measurement of some enzymes activity. Alcoholic in-patients were divided into two groups in regard to the age and the length of the disease. The activity of enzymes in the blood was measured by kinetic methods using the RA-1000/Technicon analyser. It was shown that the increase of activity of alanine aminotransferase (AlAT), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGTP), and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) may indicate the ++post-alcoholic liver damage, while increase of activity of alpha-+-amylase and ++leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) may be useful for the diagnosis of pancreas lesion, and creatine kinase (CK) as well as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) for the evaluation of postalcoholic lesion of the heart muscle.
