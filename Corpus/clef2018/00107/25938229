The Reduction of Peripheral Blood CD4+ T Cell Indicates Persistent Organ Failure in Acute Pancreatitis. Few data are available on the potential role of inflammatory mediators and T lymphocytes in persistent organ failure (POF) in acute pancreatitis (AP). We conducted a retrospective study to characterize their role in the progression of POF in AP.A total of 69 AP patients presented within 24 hours from symptom onset developing organ failure (OF) on admission were included in our study. There were 39 patients suffering from POF and 30 from transient OF (TOF). On the 1st, 3rd and 7th days after admission, blood samples were collected for biochemical concentration monitoring including serum IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). The proportions of peripheral CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes were assessed based on flow cytometry simultaneously.Patients with POF showed a significantly higher value of IL-1β and hs-CRP on day 7 compared with the group of TOF (P < 0.05). Proportions of CD4(+) T cells on days 1, 3, 7 and CD4(+)/ CD8(+) ratio on day 1 were statistically lower in the group of POF patients (P < 0.05). A CD4(+) T cell proportion of 30.34% on day 1 predicted POF with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.798, a sensitivity with 61.54% and specificity with 90.00%, respectively.The reduction of peripheral blood CD4(+) T lymphocytes is associated with POF in AP, and may act as a potential predictor.
