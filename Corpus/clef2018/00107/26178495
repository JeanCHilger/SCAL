Clinical efficacy and safety of ulinastatin plus octreotide for patients with severe acute pancreatitis. To explore the clinical efficacy and safety of ulinastatin plus octreotide for patients with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP).During January 2011 to January 2014 at our hospital, 120 SAP patients were randomly divided into control and observation groups (n = 60 each). The control group received an injection of octreotide injection while the observation group had a combination of ulinastatin and octreotide. After treatment, clinical efficiency, serum indicators and their improvements and complications were compared for two groups.The overall efficiency of observation group was significantly higher than that of control group (83.3% vs 65.0%, P < 0.05). And abdominal pain relief time, decompression time, surgical intervention rate, length of stay and mortality rate of observation group (1.9 ± 0.9 d, 6.3 ± 2.2 d, 1.7%, 11.8 ± 0.5 d, 5%) were significantly lower than those of control group (3.6 ± 0.7 d, 10.4 ± 3.1 d, 8.3%, 23.7 ± 2.1 d, 15.0%) (P < 0.05). After treatment, the levels of blood amylase, white blood cell (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) of observation group (107.2 ± 9.1 U/L, 6.2 ± 1.0 × 10(9)/L, 7.3 ± 3.4 mg/L, 28.3 ± 4.3 pg/ml) were significantly lower than those of control group (430.8 ± 20.2) U/L, (11.2 ± 1.2) × 10(9)/L, (16.3 ± 5.2) mg/L, (45.3 ± 5.9) ng/L, (P < 0.05). And the incidences of such complications as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure and shock of observation group (10.0%, 5.0%, 13.3%) were significantly lower than those of control group (36.7%, 21.7%, 33.3%) (P < 0.05).Ulinastatin plus octreotide can significantly improve the serum and clinical parameters and reduce the incidence of complications in SAP patients. And it is worthy of wider popularization.
