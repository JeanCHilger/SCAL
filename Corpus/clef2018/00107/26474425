Cartilage Oligomeric Matrix Protein-Angiopoietin-1 Has a Protective Effect of Vascular Endothelial Barrier in Rat With Acute Necrotizing Pancreatitis. To investigate the protective effect of angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) from capillary endothelial damage in rats with acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP).96 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly averaged and divided into control group, ANP group, Si-Ang-1 group, and COMP (cartilage oligomeric matrix protein)-Ang-1 group. Animals were killed at 6, 12, and 24 hours after molding. Levels of serum amylase, porcine endothelin 1, C-reactive protein, and Ang-1 were detected histopathological changes in the pancreas were observed(1) Levels of serum amylase, C-reactive protein, and porcine endothelin-1 increased and level of Ang-1 decrease in the ANP group and Si-Ang-1 group compared with the control group, whereas COMP-Ang-1 group could improve the changes. (2) The order of pancreas pathological changes (mild to severe) is: control group, COMP-Ang-1 group, ANP group, and Si-Ang-1 group. (3) Capillary permeability of the pancreatic tissue in the COMP-Ang-1 group was lower than that in the ANP group. (4) Ang-1 mRNA and protein expression in the COMP-Ang-1 group was significantly higher than in the ANP group.COMP-Ang-1 can upregulate the expression of Ang-1 protein to promote angiogenesis and improve early inflammatory and pathological damage in ANP group.
