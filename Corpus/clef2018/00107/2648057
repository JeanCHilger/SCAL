Immunocytochemical evidence of phospholipase A2 in pancreatic tumors--diagnostic values. Phospholipase A2 is an enzyme which is produced in acinar cells, and persists even in regressive states of chronic pancreatitis, when the production of other enzymes diminishes. We therefore tested this enzyme as a marker of acinar descent in various pancreatic tumors. This enzyme could be seen in 50% of the acinar-cell carcinomas, in 60% of solid and papillary pancreatic tumors, and in 50% of microglandular carcinomas. Ductal cancers and isletcell cancers were negative. In contrast to other markers of acinar matrix (amylase, antitrypsin), phospholipase A2 gave fewer false-positive or false-negative results.
