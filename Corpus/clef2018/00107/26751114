Endoscopic therapy for infected pancreatic necrosis using fully covered self-expandable metal stents: combination of transluminal necrosectomy, transluminal and percutaneous drainage. Endoscopic transluminal therapy has become the standard of care as a less invasive alternative to surgery. In a retrospective case series of two tertiary referral centers we report on an individualized concept combining EUS-guided drainage with self-expanding metal stents, direct transluminal debridement und percutaneous drainage.We treated 13 patients with infected pancreatic necrosis. Initially in all patients an EUS-guided drainage with plastic stents was performed under antibiotic protection (transduodenal: 2, transgastral: 11). After clinical consolidation (after 9.6 ± 9.4 days) a covered self-expanding metal stent (Niti-S, Taewoong medical Co., Seoul, Korea) was inserted by performing direct endoscopic necrosectomy in 2.9 ± 1.7 sessions through the stent. In cases of disrupted duct syndromes a pancreatic plastic stent was inserted (5 of 13 patients). In 5 of 13 cases additional percutaneous drainage was applied because of extended necrosis. In one patient percutaneous endoscopic drainage using the percutaneous access was needed.A sustained clinical success was achieved in 12 of 13 cases (CRP before therapy 23.5 ± 14.4 mg/L, after 3.1 ± 2.6 mg/lL). Discharge occurred after 2.5 ± 22.4 days. The self-expanding metal stent was extracted after 82.5 ± 56.6 days. Mean follow up was 8.5 ± 5.9 months.Our concept of combining transluminal drainage, direct endoscopic necrosectomy and percutaneuos drainage offers a safe and reliable alternative to surgery, even in case of extended necrosis.
