Ameliorative Effects of Curcumin on Fibrinogen-Like Protein-2 Gene Expression, Some Oxido-Inflammatory and Apoptotic Markers in a Rat Model of l-Arginine-Induced Acute Pancreatitis. The aim of the study was to investigate the ameliorative effects of curcumin on fibrinogen like protein-2 (fgl-2), some oxido-inflammatory and apoptotic markers in rat-induced acute pancreatitis (AP). Seventy-five albino rats were divided into control group, l-arginine (l-Arg)-induced AP group, curcumin pre-treated group before AP induction, curcumin post-treated group after AP induction, and curcumin injected group only. AP group showed severe necrotizing pancreatitis confirmed by histopathological changes and elevations in serum amylase and lipase activities, levels of epithelial neutrophil-activating peptide 78, tissue content of protein carbonyls, levels of tumor necrosis factor Î±, and caspase-3 as well as myeloperoxidase activity. Significant elevation in pancreatic fgl-2 mRNA expression was detected in AP group. Improvement of all parameters was detected with increase of caspase-3 in both curcumin-treated groups that confirmed curcumin ameliorative effects against AP through induction of apoptosis and inhibition of micro-thrombosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress.
