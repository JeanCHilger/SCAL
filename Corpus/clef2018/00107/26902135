Lung ultrasonography as a direct measure of evolving respiratory dysfunction and disease severity in patients with acute pancreatitis. The value of lung ultrasonography in the diagnosis of respiratory dysfunction and severity stratification in patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) was investigated.Over a 3-month period, 41 patients (median age: 59.1 years 21 males) presenting with a diagnosis of potential AP were prospectively recruited. Each participant underwent lung ultrasonography and the number of comet tails was linked with contemporaneous clinical data. Group comparisons, areas under the curve (AUC) and respective measures of diagnostic accuracy were investigated.A greater number of comet tails were evident in patients with respiratory dysfunction (P = 0.021), those with severe disease (P < 0.001) and when contemporaneous and maximum CRP exceeded 100 mg/L (P = 0.048 and P = 0.003 respectively). Receiver-operator characteristic plot area under the curve (AUC) was greater when examining upper lung quadrants, using respiratory dysfunction and AP severity as variables of interest (AUC = 0.783, 95% C.I.: 0.544-0.962, and AUC = 0.996, 95% C.I.: 0.982-1.000, respectively). Examining all lung quadrants except for the lower lateral resulted in greater AUCs for contemporaneous and maximum CRP (AUC = 0.708, 95% C.I.: 0.510-0.883, and AUC = 0.800, 95% C.I.: 0.640-0.929).Ultrasonography of non-dependent lung parenchyma can reliably detect evolving respiratory dysfunction in AP. This simple bedside technique shows promise as an adjunct to severity stratification.
