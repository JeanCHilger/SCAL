Association of the HindIII Lipoprotein Lipase Gene Polymorphism with the Development of the Non-Biliary Acute Pancreatitis: a Pilot Study. We studied the relationship between lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene HindIII polymorphism and the development of acute pancreatitis in the Russian population. Whole blood samples were collected from 145 patients with acute non-biliary pancreatitis and 191 healthy individuals. Genotyping of LPL gene HindIII (rs320) polymorphism was performed by PCR with TaqMan assay. It was found that allele H+ (OR=0.63, 95%CI 0.41-0.96, p=0.03) and genotype H+/H+ (OR=1.79, 95%CI 1.06-3.04, p=0.03) were associated with the risk of acute non-biliary pancreatitis only in males. In this study, the relationship between HindIII polymorphism of LPL gene with the risk of acute non-biliary pancreatitis was revealed.
