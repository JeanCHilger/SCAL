Sulindac-induced acute pancreatitis mimicking gallstone pancreatitis. Two patients with sulindac-induced acute pancreatitis presented clinically with abdominal pain, right upper-quadrant tenderness, markedly increased serum amylase values, and hyperbilirubinemia, findings initially suggestive of gallstone pancreatitis. Ultrasound examinations were negative for gallstones. One patient was inadvertently treated two years later with sulindac with recurrence of abdominal pain, marked hyperamylasemia, and jaundice. Clinical resolution was rapid with each episode following discontinuation of sulindac.
