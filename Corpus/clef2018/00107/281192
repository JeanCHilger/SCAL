Iatrogenic pancreatitis. A fatal complication in the induction therapy for acute lymphocytic leukemia. A patient with acute lymphocytic leukemia developed acute pancreatitis during induction therapy with corticosteroids and asparaginase. Postmortem examination showed changes consistent with hemorrhagic pancreatitis and fat necrosis over the pancreas and omentum. Corticosteroids were thought to be responsible for pancreatitis in this patient since "hemorrhagic pancreatitis" has not been previously described with asparaginase. We recommend careful follow-up of serum and urinary amylase values in patients receiving induction therapy with these agents.
