Effect of FOY-305 (camostate) on severe acute pancreatitis in two experimental animal models. Two models of severe acute pancreatitis were chosen and pancreatitis induced by sodium taurocholate and by a choline-deficient ethionine-supplemented diet, to evaluate the effectiveness of FOY-305 (camostate), a new synthetic trypsin inhibitor. Prophylactic administration of FOY-305 had a significantly favorable effect on the course of the sodium taurocholate-induced disease and on the survival rate of the treated group. A beneficial effect on the amylase and lipase content in serum and ascites was found, but no effect was observed on enzyme concentration in pancreatic tissue or on the degree of histologically detectable organ destruction. Therapeutic administration of FOY-305 had a significantly positive influence when infused directly, 5 and 30 min after the operation, whereas enzyme increase and organ destruction remained unaffected. FOY-305 showed a beneficial effect when given prophylactically or therapeutically at the beginning of the pancreatitis induced by a CDE diet, with no significant change in enzyme increase and degree of organ destruction. The favorable effect on survival time and rate in the early phase of these two severe experimental forms of pancreatitis may justify an evaluation of FOY-305 in a clinically controlled study.
