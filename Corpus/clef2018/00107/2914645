Role of pancreatic enzymes and their substrates in autodigestion of the pancreas. In vitro studies with isolated rat pancreatic acini. Intrapancreatic activation of proteases is believed to play a major role in the pathogenesis of acute necrotizing pancreatitis. Several authors have questioned, however, the central role of trypsin in autodigestion of the pancreas. To clarify the direct effects of pancreatic enzymes and other related factors on acinar cells, we used the model of isolated pancreatic acini. Acini were prepared from male Wistar rats by collagenase digestion. Protein synthesis was measured by incubation of acini with [35S]methionine. Acini were resuspended thereafter in fresh buffer and further incubated for 30-90 min under various conditions [e.g., with pancreatic homogenates, ascites (from rats with pancreatitis induced by sodium taurocholate), pure pancreatic enzymes, and other factors]. The percentage of release of newly synthesized proteins into the culture medium was regarded as a biochemical parameter of cellular integrity. A morphologic score of cellular integrity was obtained via light microscopic evaluation of acini at the end of the various incubations by measuring the degree of cell lysis, loss of cell granules, ballooning, formation of vacuoles, and karyopyknosis. When normal [35S]methionine-labeled pancreatic acini were incubated with various factors, the percentage of release of labeled proteins into the medium was as follows: incubation with HEPES/Ringer's buffer, 1.8% hemorrhagic pancreatic ascites, 3.8%
