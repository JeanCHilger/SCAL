Effect of contrical introduced into Wirsung's duct on the morphofunctional response of the pancreas in acute experimental pancreatitis. Induction of contrical into Wirsung's duct is shown to lessen the total proteolytic amylolytic and lipolytic action of the pancreatic juice, blood and urine, normalizing by this token the exo- and endosecretion of the pancreas. It is also shown that in acute pancreatitis there is in evidence hyperfunction of the acinar glandular cells, responsible for the synthesis of the secretion, and their focal destruction. Introduction of contrical into Wirsung's duct degrades intracellular processes of the secretion synthesis.
