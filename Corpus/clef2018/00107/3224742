Maternal survival after acute haemorrhagic pancreatitis complicating late pregnancy. In the 41st week of her first pregnancy, a 25-year-old woman presented abdominal complaints. After the Caesarean delivery of an healthy child, the mother developed a severe hypoglycaemia and septic shock. Although normal serum and urine amylase values were obtained, an exploratory laparotomy disclosed acute haemorrhagic pancreatitis. Clinical treatment was complicated by repeated sepsis, multiple organ failure and ARDS, requiring the patient to receive intensive care for 3.5 months. To control abdominal sepsis and bleeding complications, an additional ten laparotomies were carried out. During this period the abdomen was kept closed by means of a nylon mesh. Although according to present day criteria the prognosis was fatal, the patient ultimately fully recovered. By exclusion, the cause of the pancreatitis was ascribed to the pregnancy itself. The medical, obstetric and surgical aspects of the management of acute pancreatitis complicating pregnancy and puerperium are reviewed.
