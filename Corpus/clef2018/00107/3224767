New canine model of chronic pancreatitis due to chronic ischemia with incomplete pancreatic duct obstruction. A new experimental model of chronic pancreatitis was produced by a combination of chronic ischemia and incomplete obstruction of the pancreatic duct. Ischemia was induced by ligation and separation of branches flowing into the left pancreatic lobe from the splenic artery. Incomplete ductal obstruction was achieved by ligation and separation of the minor pancreatic duct and placement of a polyethylene tube in the major pancreatic duct. Macroscopic examination at 6 months after model preparation showed that the pancreas was hard, with severe inflammatory change. In the secretin test, the flow rate of pancreatic juice, amylase output and bicarbonate concentration were significantly reduced as compared with the controls. Pancreatography revealed dilatation and meandering of the major pancreatic duct and poor visualization of its secondary and tertiary bifurcations. The histopathological findings consisted of a decrease in the pancreatic parenchyma, replacement of fat, severe inflammatory cell infiltration, extensive fibrosis and tubular complexes. This model most closely resembles human chronic pancreatitis, and is a very useful instrument.
