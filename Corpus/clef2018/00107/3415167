The value of immunoreactive lipase in acute pancreatitis. We have evaluated a new agglutination test for serum immunoreactive lipase in 24 patients with abdominal pain and hyperamylasaemia. On admission all 20 patients with acute pancreatitis had a positive lipase test, 3 of the 4 patients who did not have pancreatitis had a negative lipase test. The sensitivity of the lipase test on day 1 is 100%, the specificity 96% and predictive value of a positive test is 95.2% compared to 83% for amylase. A negative test excludes pancreatitis. In addition, the test stays positive longer than hyperamylasaemia.
