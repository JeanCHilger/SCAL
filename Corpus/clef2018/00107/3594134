Acute pancreatitis associated with carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater. Acute pancreatitis associated with pancreatic carcinoma or tumour metastases in the pancreas is well documented. In this paper we show a similar association between acute pancreatitis and ampullary carcinoma. Of 41 patients with ampullary carcinoma seen at a single centre over a 25 year period (1959-83), 6 developed acute pancreatitis. Three other patients with a history of obstructive jaundice were noted to show mild transient hyperamylasaemia. Endoscopic retrograde choledochopancreatography is mandatory in the investigation of such patients.
