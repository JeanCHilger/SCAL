Pancreatitis coincident with Crohn's ileocolitis. Report of a case and review of the literature. A young woman who developed acute pancreatitis coincident with Crohn's disease is presented. The pancreatitis was documented by pancreatic hyperamylasemia, elevated urine amylase activity, abdominal sonogram, computed tomography, and laparotomy. A cause-and-effect relationship has not been established, however no etiology other than the Crohn's disease, which was confined to the ileum and colon, could be identified. Surgical removal of the severely involved ileum led to the resolution of the pancreatitis. A possible relationship between acute pancreatitis and Crohn's disease is proposed, although potential pathophysiologic mechanisms are unknown. The diagnosis of pancreatic involvement in such cases may make an important contribution to therapy.
