Therapeutic pancreatic duct occlusion in chronic pancreatitis: clinical, exocrine and endocrine consequences in a 12 month follow-up study. Therapeutic pancreatic duct occlusion (PDO) is applied to preserve endocrine pancreatic function by atrophizing and thus eliminating chronically inflamed exocrine pancreatic parenchyma. So far, efficient and lasting elimination of exocrine parenchyma is brought about only by intraoperative PDO upon partial duodenopancreatectomy. While partial duodenopancreatectomy itself reduces endocrine pancreatic function by about 40%, intraoperative PDO does not further impair endocrine function. Endocrine function is not affected at all by endoscopic PDO, which has to be improved, however, concerning its eliminatory effect on exocrine pancreatic parenchyma.
