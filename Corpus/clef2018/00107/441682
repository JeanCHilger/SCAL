Lymph and blood enzymes and pathologic alterations in canine experimental pancreatitis after administration of benzo-pyrones. The effect of Venalot, a combination of two benzo-pyrones, on canine experimental acute pancreatitis was examined. Activities of lymph and blood plasma enzymes, thoracic duct lymph flow, and morphological changes of the pancreas were compared with those of a control group of dogs. The drug was found to enhance the removal of amylase and trypsin via lymph from the gland and to decrease the elevation of plasma amylase and lactate dehydrogenase. When administered simultaneously with the induction of pancreatitis, benzo-pyrones were effective in the reduction of pancreatic edema and necroses.
