The unusual presentation of pancreatitis in infancy. Two infants with acute pancreatitis are described. It appears that acute pancreatitis in infancy presents in one of two ways: part of a severe generalized illness, or as ascites. The outlook for the former depends on the prognosis of the generalized illness. If pancreatitis can be recognized as the cause of the ascites, then adequate treatment will result in survival. Although the cause in some infants is said to be idiopathic, exploration should be performed, the lesser sac investigated and if the child is in reasonable condition, appropriate study of the biliary tree and pancreatic ductile system should be considered. If a pseudocyst is present, adequate drainage is mandatory. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment will be possible only if this rare disorder is suspected. The eventual prognosis is excellent and the chance of recurrent attacks is minimal.
