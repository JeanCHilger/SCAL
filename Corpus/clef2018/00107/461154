Defibrination syndrome during acute pancreatitis: 6 cases. Prospective studies of coagulation in 41 patients (author's transl). Studies of coagulation were performed prospectively in 41 patients with mild to moderately severe acute pancreatitis. Six patients (15%) presented with coagulation data suggestive of defibrination two of them had clinical signs of bleeding. No other cause than pancreatitis was found in these 6 patients to account for coagulation abnormalities. Comparing the patients who presented defibrination to those who did not, no difference was observed in clinical course and admission values of serum amylase, fibrinogen, urea, calcium, glucose, transaminase levels, white blood cell count and arterial partial pressure of oxygen. Platelets counts and serum creatinine levels were respectively lower and higher in the first group of patients.
