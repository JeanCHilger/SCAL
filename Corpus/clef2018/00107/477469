Prevention of postoperative pancreatic complications following duodenopancreatectomy using somatostatin. Somatostatin was prophylactically administered to 10 patients who had surgery for pancreatic diseases. The postoperative course uncomplicated with no increase in serum amylase levels. Bile induced acute pancreatitis in six beagles was prophylactically treated with somatostatin. The results demonstrate that SRIF not only inhibits basal but also pancreatic-induced blood amylase and enzyme activities in the dog. SRIF-treated animals were in good general condition compared with untreated controls, macroscopic and histologic aspects of the pancreas were significantly improved.
