Evaluation of gamma radiation therapy in experimentally induced hemorrhagic pancreatitis in dogs. Acute bile-trypsin pancreatitis was induced in two groups of six dogs each. One group was given supportive treatment only the second group was treated with irradiation of the pancreas (400 rad). A third group of six dogs was irradiated, but pancreatitis was not induced. A 13-fold increase in survival time was observed in the dogs with pancreatitis which had been irradiated. Irradiation alone was found to reduce the volume of pancreatic secretion with a relative increase in trypsin content. Modification of the inflammatory reaction by irradiation and reduction in pancreatic secretion probably account for the therapeutic effect.
