Serum lipase assay for clinical use. Critical study (author's transl). An accurate, quick, and reproducible method to assay serum lipase activity allowed a parallel study of lipase and amylase in 147 patients. Lipase appeared very specific of pancreatic distress. In acute pancreatitis its increase was constant, frank, quick and lasting. It brought a diagnostic argument superior to the dosages of amylase activities in serum and/or urine. But its value as an evolutive and pronostic test was as much limited. Its interest as a negative argument for differential diagnosis was not superior either. In chronic pancreatic diseases, it gave evidence of massive spread or complications.
