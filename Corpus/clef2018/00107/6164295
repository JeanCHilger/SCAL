Serum cholinesterase, serum lipase, and serum amylase levels during long-term echothiophate iodide therapy. Previous studies have found increased pancreatic intraductal pressures in dogs and the development of acute pancreatitis in humans after cholinergic stimulation. However, we did not find abnormally high levels of serum lipase or serum amylase in 44 patients with glaucoma using therapeutic doses of echothiophate iodide for intraocular pressure control on a long-term basis.
