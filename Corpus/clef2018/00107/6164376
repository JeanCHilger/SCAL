Cimetidine after operations on Vater papilla (author's transl). The effectiveness of Cimetidine in preventing complications, like acute pancreatitis and hemorrhagic gastritis, after operations on Vater papilla (ISP) is studied. In patients treated with Cimetidine the volume of nasogastric secretion was smaller and diastasemia and diastasuria treated values returned to the normal range earlier than in non-treated patients. In the latter group a case of pancreatitis and one of post-operative hemorrhagic gastritis were found. The treated patients, instead, did not suffer these complications. It was concluded that Cimetidine after IPS is useful, because it complies with the request that determined its employ.
