Protective effect of ranitidine in acute experimental pancreatitis in the rat. Acute experimental pancreatitis was induced in rats, with a polyethylene splint placed into the duodenum, by the closed duodenal loop technique. Ranitidine (20 mg . kg-1) or saline were administered intraperitoneally every 8 hrs, beginning 15 min prior to surgery. The degree of pancreatitis and the amylase to creatinine clearance ratio (ACCR) were evaluated in all the animals after sacrifice. Ranitidine-treated animals showed significant by reduced pancreatic damage and ACCR values in comparison with non-treated rats. These data confirm the efficacy of ranitidine as a preventive agent in the development of acute pancreatitis and suggest that controlled trials should be performed with this H2-antagonist in the human subyects with this disease.
