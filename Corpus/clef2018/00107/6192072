Immunohistochemical demonstration of altered functional differentiation of pancreatic tissue in sacrococcygeal teratomas. The finding of teratomas with mature-appearing pancreatic tissue showing abnormal production of immunoreactive amylase appears to contradict earlier suggestions that somatic tissue in teratomas that appears mature also functions normally. It therefore seems judicious to study carefully both morphologic and functional characteristics of tissues in teratomas before utilizing them as experimental models of tissue differentiation, since at least in the case of human amylase, functional differentiation does not always follow morphologic differentiation.
