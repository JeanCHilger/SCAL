Gallstone pancreatitis. The charts of 55 patients with clinical and surgical evidence of pancreatitis, secondary to gallstones, were reviewed. Patients with a history of high alcoholic intake were excluded. Gallstones were retrieved from all patients, 18 (33%) of whom had choledocholithiasis. Severe pancreatitis with extensive fat necrosis was documented during surgery in 27 patients (49%). We found an inverse relationship between the preoperative serum amylase levels and the severity of pancreatitis. Cholecystectomy was performed in 53 patients (96%). The operative mortality rate was 5.5%, and severe postoperative complications developed in five patients (9%). The follow-up period ranged from two to 24 years, and 39 of the patients in the follow-up evaluation remained completely asymptomatic postoperatively.
