On the pathogenesis of pancreatic ascites. The pancreatic ascites of 2 patients and the drainage fluid collected adjacent to the pancreas postoperatively of 1 of them were analyzed for protein composition and enzyme activity. We did not find a proteolytic activity, especially enzymatically active trypsin and chymotrypsin in these fluids. Immunoreactive (inactive) trypsin was, however, present in rather high concentrations. The drainage fluid changed from an inflammatory exudate to a fluid similar in composition to pancreatic juice later on. Our results indicate that pancreatic ascites consist of a combination of enzyme-rich pancreatic fluid and protein-rich exudate from the inflamed pancreas. No evidence of peritonitis or of proteolytic activity capable of inducing peritonitis was found.
