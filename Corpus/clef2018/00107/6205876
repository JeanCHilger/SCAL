Prostaglandin E1 treatment in experimental acute pancreatitis in the rat. Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) was tested for cytoprotective activity against the development of experimental acute pancreatitis in the rat induced by the closed duodenal loop technique. Sham-operated, untreated and PGE1-treated pancreatic rats were investigated. All rats received an initial bolus of 3 ml 5% dextrose in normal saline (D5NS) via jugular catheter 30 min prior to surgery, and a continuous subcutaneous infusion of 35 ml D5NS over 24 h. Each treated rat received 10 micrograms/kg PGE1 in the initial bolus and a maintenance dosage of 10 micrograms/kg/h via the infusate. Serum amylase rose significantly in all pancreatic rats with no significant difference between treated and untreated. Pancreatic edema was more pronounced in PGE1-treated than in untreated rats. The ischemic and autolytic damage to acinar cells and vascular endothelial cells typical of untreated pancreatitis was delayed by PGE1. Mortality rates were unaffected by PGE1.
