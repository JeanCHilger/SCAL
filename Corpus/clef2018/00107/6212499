Prognostic value of computed tomography in acute pancreatitis (author's transl). A prospective study was performed in 50 patients with acute pancreatitis to find out the value of computed tomography for an early prognosis. CT findings (retroperitoneal fluid collections with enlargement of the retroperitoneal space, intraperitoneal air-fluid levels and ascites), clinical (age, ileus) and laboratory tests (LDH, blood glucose, urea, creatinine and calcium) were taken into consideration. These data were collected during the first two days after hospitalisation and turned out to be of considerable prognostic value: About 70% of the patients died when 5 or more of these pathological findings existed. More than 90% of all patients who died belonged to this group.
