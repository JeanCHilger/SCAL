Pancreatic duct occlusion with Ethibloc. An experimental study in juvenile pigs. In the transplantation of vascularized pancreatic grafts severe problems are related to the exocclusion is an improved alternative to duct ligation in producing atrophy of the exocrine pancreas while leaving the endocrine pancreas intact. Fractional growth rate in duct-ligated and duct-occluded animals was reduced to 1/3 - 1/4 of that of sham operated controls. Fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, sum of blood glucose and glucose elimination rate during an intravenous glucose tolerance test remained normal in the duct-ligated and Ethibloc-occluded animals. There was a diminished insulin response to a maximal glucose load. In spite of this, the glucose tolerance remained virtually normal. The volume of the pancreas was reduced to 1/3 of its normal size after both experimental procedures. Histologically, the islets appeared to remain normal, while the exocrine portion of the gland was replaced by fibrous tissue. No traces of the active compound, Ethibloc, remained after 4 weeks. This study shows that pancreatic duct occlusion with Ethibloc results in impairment of endocrine function. Consequently, Ethibloc duct occlusion does not seem to be a superior alternative to other methods of producing exocrine atrophy in organs intended for transplantation.
