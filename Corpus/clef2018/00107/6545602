Acute pancreatitis associated with a calculosis of the gallbladder in childhood. Review of the literature and personal experience. The authors present a case of a thirteen year old girl with acute hemorrhagic pancreatis and cholelithiasis. They show the rarity of this pathology in children underlaying the difficulty of an early diagnosis emphasizing the lack of specific symptoms with the exception of an increase of amylase in the saliva and in the serum, the only laboratory data. Moreover, they underlay a more favourable prognosis in children than in adults.
