Lactoferrin and albumin in human pancreatic juice: a valuable test for diagnosis of pancreatic diseases. Lactoferrin and albumin concentrations in pure pancreatic juice were studied by radial immunodiffusion in 81 patients. Lactoferrin concentration (% of total protein) was specifically increased in patients suffering from chronic calcifying pancreatitis (mean +/- SE: 0.169 +/- 0.024) and no overlap was observed with patients suffering from other pancreatic diseases (0.008 +/- 0.001), organic nonpancreatic diseases (0.011 +/- 0.001) and without organic disease (0.01 +/- 0.001). Lactoferrin concentration was not found to be correlated with chronic alcohol consumption or pancreatic insufficiency. Albumin concentration (% of total protein) was increased in patients suffering from chronic calcifying pancreatitis (5.55 +/- 0.49) and other pancreatic diseases (5.45 +/- 1.02). These values were significantly higher (P less than 0.001) than the corresponding values in patients with organic nonpancreatic diseases (1.66 +/- 0.16) and patients without organic diseases (1.46 +/- 0.22). Measuring lactoferrin and albumin in pancreatic juice may aid in the diagnosis of pancreatic disease and in the differentiation of chronic calcifying pancreatitis, even in the earliest stage, from other pancreatic diseases such as pancreatic carcinoma or acute pancreatitis.
