Effect of serotonin on secretory and lysosomal enzyme activity in pancreatic tissue and the inhibitory properties of serum. Experiments on rats have demonstrated that changes in the serotonin level in the body intensifies pancreatic function. The pancreas shows the increased contents of trypsinogen and proelastase and those of lysosomal enzymes (cathepsins and acid phosphatase). Administration of serotonin leads to the reduction of the inhibitory properties of blood serum versus proteolytic pancreatic enzymes. Administration of serotonin to animals with the preliminarily ligated pancreatic duct results in the development of pancreatitis with a pronounced fat necrosis of the pancreatic tissue.
