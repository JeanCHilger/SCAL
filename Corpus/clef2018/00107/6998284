A randomized double-blind trial of glucagon in treatment of first attack of severe acute pancreatitis without associated biliary disease. The effects of glucagon versus placebo were evaluated in a double-blind trial including only patients with a first attack of severe acute pancreatitis not associated with biliary disease. All 22 patients had deterioriation of their clinical condition, elevated serum amylase and pulse rate above 100/min. or shock. An initial dose of 1 mg. glucagon was given as a bolus injection followed by infusion of 6 mg. in 1,500 ml. saline/24 hr. for three days. All were treated with nasogastric decompression, fluids, calcium and antibiotics. Severe complications developed in five of the 10 patients receiving glucagon and in eight of the 12 given a placebo. Three of the 10 (glucagon) and five of the 12 (placebo) died from these complications. Hemorrhagic pancreatitis was found in 11 patients at laparotomy or autopsy. Three of the five with hemorrhagic pancreatitis in the glucagon group and four of the six in the placebo group died. Pooling the data of the present and two other studies makes it probable that glucagon has no effect on mortality from acute severe pancreatitis.
