Prognosis of patients with acute pancreatitis as predicted by clinical, laboratory and CT diagnostic data (author's transl). A prospective study was performed in 59 patients with acute pancreatitis evaluating the following 11 diagnostic parameters in regard to prognosis quo ad vitam: clinical (ileus, age), laboratory tests (LDH, blood glucose, urea, creatinine, calcium), CT-scan (fluid in the retroperitoneal space, enlargement of the retroperitoneal space, air-fluid levels, ascites). These data were collected during the first 24-48 hours after hospitalisation of the patients and turned out to be of considerable prognostic value. 70-80% of the patients from groups in which 5 or more of these parameters were pathological died. 90% of all patients who died belonged to the aforementioned groups.
