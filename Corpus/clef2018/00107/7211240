Excessive hypertriglyceridemia and pancreatitis in pregnancy. Association with deficiency of lipoprotein lipase. Acute pancreatitis verified at laparotomy occurred in the 37th week in 1 of 4 women who developed excessive hypertriglyceridemia (type V hyperlipoproteinemia) during pregnancy. The hypertriglyceridemia was associated with and possibly caused by deficiency of lipoprotein lipase, measured as the NaCl sensitive component of post-heparin lipase activity. A severely fat-restricted diet controlled the hypertriglyceridemia in 1 of the patients, followed during a second pregnancy.
