Early course in acute pancreatitis (author's transl). In this retrospective study the prognostic significance of 5 laboratory parameters in a low and high range (LDH) greater than or equal to 450 and 600 U/l, calcium less than or equal to 2.2 and 2.0 mmol/l, bloodglucose greater than or equal to 160 and 240 mg/dl, creatinine greater than or equal to 1.5 and 2.0 mg/dl, BUN greater than or equal to 25 and 40 mg/dl) and the patient's age was determined in 298 cases at the first attack of acute pancreatitis. The laboratory parameters were determined on the day of admission. The results presented in this study allow 2 major conclusions: 1. both the low and the high range laboratory parameters are potent indices in predicting a high risk group of patients very early. 2. a higher specificity is achieved by these high range parameters.
