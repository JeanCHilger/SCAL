Trophic and functional changes of the pancreas induced by chronic truncal vagotomy. The effects of chronic truncal vagotomy on the pancreatic gland was studied in male adult Wistar rats. Two to three months after parasympathetic decentralization, the gland weight was found to be significantly increased by nearly 100%. This trophic effect is mainly due to the proliferation of young acinar cells. Concomitantly, there is a decrease of the ductular mass and of the Langerhans islets. Choline acetylase activity was decreased by about 35% to 40% in the vagotomized pancreas. Further, enzyme concentration was found to be greater in the head than in the body and tail of the gland, thus suggesting a higher nerve density of vagal cholinergic fibers in the former than in the latter. Basal pancreatic secretion of the decentralized gland showed a significant increase in the flow rate with no significant changes in both bicarbonate concentration and output. Protein concentration was significantly reduced at 60 minutes protein output remained unchanged. The most remarkable finding was the fall in both lipase concentration and output (60-70%) when compared with control values. These findings may be related to clinical manifestations after long-term vagotomy.
