Chronic pancreatitis in late childhood and adolescence. Acute pancreatitis is unusual in pediatric patients, and chronic pancreatitis is even less common. Between 1983 and 1988, we diagnosed 24 patients in late childhood and adolescence with chronic pancreatitis. Our review revealed that chronic pancreatitis presents as recurrent abdominal pain in late childhood and adolescence. Individual laboratory and radiological investigations may be normal during acute exacerbations of pain, but the determination of serum amylase and lipase concentrations--combined with ultrasonography--will accurately identify most patients. We found that endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is a valuable tool in the diagnosis of structural abnormalities. Surgical intervention may reduce symptoms in patients with structural abnormalities. There is a tendency toward decreased frequency and severity of pain as the patients increase in age.
