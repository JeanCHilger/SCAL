Induction of heat shock protein and prevention of caerulein-induced pancreatitis by water-immersion stress in rats. Water-immersion stress is known to be involved in the development of hemorrhagic pancreatitis in caerulein-induced pancreatitis, when the stress is given following caerulein injection. The effects of pre-treatment with water-immersion to caerulein-induced pancreatitis were investigated in this study. 1. A 60-kDa heat shock protein was induced by pre-treatment with water-immersion stress in the pancreas. 2. Intra-peritoneal injection of caerulein (40 micrograms/kg) induced acute pancreatitis in rats without pre-treatment with water-immersion. However, when the rats were pre-treated with water-immersion, acute pancreatitis was not developed and no change of serum amylase levels was observed by i.p. injection of caerulein.
