Xanthine oxidase activation in cerulein- and taurocholate-induced acute pancreatitis in rats. Oxygen free radicals (OFR) are postulated to play a role in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis. The aim of this work was to examine the role of xanthine oxidase in the generation of OFR and the activity of the endogenous defense mechanisms as reflected by pancreatic superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in a model of edematous pancreatitis induced in rats by administration of cerulein at supramaximal doses, as well as in necrohemorrhagic model induced by intraductal administration of sodium taurocholate. Comparison between these two models of pancreatitis suggests important differences in origin and importance in the evolution of injury. In necrohemorrhagic pancreatitis OFR can be produced by xanthine oxidase activity probably associated to cell death. By contrast, in cerulein induced pancreatitis, other sources of oxygen free radicals, such as inflammatory cells, can be of more importance.
