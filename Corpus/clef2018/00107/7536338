Simplified model of induction of experimental acute pancreatitis with a supra-maximal dose of cerulein. The study was performed to compare an usual method of induction of acute experimental pancreatitis with a simplified, easier and faster induction through a subcutaneous and intravenous injection of cerulein, with good reproducibility as compared to the literature. Four groups were studied. In the group I, continuous three hour intravenous injection of 15 micrograms/Kg of cerulein, was given. Group II was a control group with saline infusion. Group III received a subcutaneous injection of 20 micrograms/Kg and an intravenous injection of 20 micrograms/Kg of cerulein one hour later. Group IV was the control group with saline. The results of biochemical measurements, such as tecidual trypsinogen, chimotrypsinogen, proelastase, cathepsin and serum amylase, showed no difference between the two methods. Histologic study revealed edematous pancreatitis in group I and III, with moderate acinar necrose in group III. These results suggest that the proposed simplified method induces enough acute and edematous pancreatitis to allow studies in physiopathology and therapeutics.
