"Human pancreas-specific protein" (procarboxypeptidase B): a valuable marker in pancreatitis? Human pancreas-specific protein (PASP) has been characterized previously as a serum marker for pancreatitis. It was then identified as pancreatic procarboxypeptidase B (PCB). The aim of the present study was to verify the usefulness of PASP (PCB) as a serum marker in patients with acute (n = 20) and chronic (n = 12) pancreatitis and in those following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP) (n = 44). Serum PASP values were analyzed by radioimmunoassay, with a range of normal values between 15 and 111 ng/ml. Between April 1992 and September 1992, 20 subjects (19-86 years of age) with acute pancreatitis (alcoholic, 8 biliary, 8
