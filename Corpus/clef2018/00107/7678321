Humoral factors that induce alterations of the pancreas in rats with obstructive jaundice. This study was conducted to investigate the role of humoral factors in pancreatic alterations induced by obstructive jaundice (OJ) in rats. OJ in male Sprague-Dawley rats induced significant increases in pancreatic weight, DNA content, and RNA content of acinar cells. These changes were accompanied by enlargement of eosinophilic granules and compressed nuclei. Protein, amylase, and trypsinogen contents of pancreas were also increased in OJ rats. In addition, plasma levels of bilirubin, cholecystokinin (CCK), and estradiol increased in OJ rats and were correlated positively with each other and with pancreatic weights. Administration of a specific CCK receptor, L-364,718, to OJ rats partly attenuated the changes of the pancreas, indicating that CCK is involved in these changes. These findings suggest that estradiol may be involved in regulating the pancreatic changes induced by OJ in rats.
