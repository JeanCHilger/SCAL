Pancreatic duct obstruction triggers acute necrotizing pancreatitis in the opossum. The common channel theory suggests that bile reflux, through a common biliopancreatic channel, triggers acute pancreatitis. In the present study, this controversial issue was evaluated using an experimental model of hemorrhagic necrotizing pancreatitis.American opossums underwent ligation of the pancreatic duct alone, bile and pancreatic duct separately, or common biliopancreatic duct the severity of pancreatitis was evaluated at selected times after ligation.Animals in all three experimental groups developed hemorrhagic necrotizing pancreatitis the severity of pancreatitis was similar in each group, although only those subjected to common biliopancreatic duct ligation experienced bile reflux.Bile reflux into the pancreatic duct, via a common biliopancreatic channel, is not necessary for the development of pancreatitis and does not worsen the severity of pancreatitis associated with pancreatic duct obstruction in this model.
