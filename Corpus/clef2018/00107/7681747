Effect of intrinsic CCK and CCK antagonist on pancreatic growth and pancreatic enzyme secretion in pancreaticobiliary diversion rats. When pancreaticobiliary diversion (PBD) surgery was performed in rats, plasma CCK level increased, the pancreas grew mainly by proliferation, and pancreatic trypsinogen showed a remarkable increase, although amylase and lipase synthesis were somewhat decreased. The sensitivity of amylase release against CCK-8 in the pancreatic acini decreased when plasma CCK level was high. These changes in pancreatic growth and pancreatic enzyme secretion caused by PBD were completely inhibited by the CCK-receptor antagonist loxiglumide. From these results, intrinsic CCK was considered to play an important role in both pancreatic enzyme synthesis and proliferation.
