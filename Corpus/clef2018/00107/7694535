Recurrent nodular panniculitis associated with pancreas divisum. We report the case of a 46-year old woman who, over a 12-year period, had 6 episodes of nodular panniculitis. Each lesion regressed and disappeared within four to six weeks. Fistulization before formation of a cupula-shaped scar was observed on two occasions. These episodes of hypodermitis seemed to be isolated when they began, but histological examination of the skin showed cytosteatonecrosis of the hypodermis pointing to a pancreatic origin. Signs of pancreatic abnormality appeared progressively: first an increase of amylasaemia concomitant with the cutaneous flares, then morphological abnormalities of the pancreatic ducts suggestive of pancreas divisum, and finally dilatation of the main pancreatic duct associated with upstream pancreatitis. No radical treatment of the pancreatic abnormality was carried out.
