Enzyme-histochemical studies of ischemic damage to the pancreaticoduodenal graft ready for transplantation in the dog. The ischaemic lesion of the pancreaticoduodenal graft prepared for transplantation was studied by enzyme histochemical methods. Estimation of lactate dehydrogenase, non-specific acid and alkaline phosphatases and esterases and of glucose-6-phosphatase pancreas. While in the pancreas, lesions due to warm ischaemia will appear after one hour, the same can be observed in the duodenum after 30 minutes and in both organs the lesions progress rapidly. Lesions resulting from cold effects appear in the pancreas after three hours and remain unchanged for 15 to 18 hours, while in the duodenum they will appear after one hour and deteriorate considerably after three hours. Continuous perfusion for more than 30 minutes or the glucose perfusion test performed after cold ischaemia of more than two hours duration considerably affected the enzymes of the organs.
