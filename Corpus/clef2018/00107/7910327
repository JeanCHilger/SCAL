Blood tests for detection of alcoholic cause of acute pancreatitis. We investigated the ability of various blood markers to detect an alcoholic cause of acute pancreatitis. Serum carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT) was significantly correlated with reported 2 month and 7 day ethanol consumptions and was significantly higher in 42 patients with alcoholic acute pancreatitis and in 24 patients with possibly alcoholic acute pancreatitis than in 20 patients with non-alcoholic disease. At a cutoff over 17 U/L, the specificity of CDT was 100% and the sensitivity was 75% to detect an alcoholic cause of acute pancreatitis. The lipase/amylase ratio index, erythrocyte mean corpuscular volume, and gamma glutamyl transferase could not distinguish alcoholic from non-alcoholic acute pancreatitis.
