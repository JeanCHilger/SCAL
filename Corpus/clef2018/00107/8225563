Effect of prostaglandins and superoxide dismutase administration on oxygen free radical production in experimental acute pancreatitis. Oxygen free radicals and prostaglandins are implicated in the pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis, although their mechanisms of action remain unclear. We have studied the effect of administration of exogenous 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 and superoxide dismutase on oxygen free radical production in acute pancreatitis. For this purpose, five experimental rat groups were studied: group I, control group II, sodium taurocholate-induced acute pancreatitis
