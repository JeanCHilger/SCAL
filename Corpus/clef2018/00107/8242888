Biochemical tests in the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis and in the evaluation of pancreatic insufficiency. Chronic pancreatitis (adults) and cystic fibrosis (children) are the most common diseases leading to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency that, when reduced to < 5% of normal function, is characterised by steatorrhoea. The pathogenesis of the former condition is outlined, and recent concepts are emphasized. Biochemical tests to detect pancreatic insufficiency and to identify pancreatic disease as the cause of steatorrhoea include: serum enzyme tests (lipase, amylase, trypsin) stool chymotrypsin
