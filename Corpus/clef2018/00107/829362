Calcium, pancreatic secretion and pancreatitis (author's transl). The concentration of calcium in the pancreatic juice is lower than in plasma. Two calcium fractions occur in the juice, the one associated with the enzyme protein and the other entering the juice via diffusion. In chronic pancreatitis the calcium concentration of the juice is increased in post-secretin periods. Hypercalcemia stimulates enzyme secretion and elevates calcium concentration in the juice. Hypocalcemia inhibits secretion of enzymes and fluid. Calcium is an important mediator substance for the secretion of pancreatic hydrolases at the intracellular level. In primary hyperparathyroidism with chronic hypercalcemia the prevalence of acute and chronic pancreatitis is 10--12 times higher than in normal population. In chronic pancreatitis caused by alcoholism, primary hyperparathyroidism, and chronic protein deficiency without alcoholism calcifying duct stones are seen in the pancreas in high frequency.
