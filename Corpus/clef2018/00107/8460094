Assay of trypsinogen activation in the cat experimental model of acute pancreatitis. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for trypsinogen activation peptide (TAP) was used to measure urinary TAP levels in standard feline models of acute oedematous pancreatitis and acute haemorrhagic pancreatitis. It has been shown that the extent of pancreatic damage as assessed histologically is significantly greater in the model of acute haemorrhagic pancreatitis. This increase in damage has been found to be associated with a significantly greater increase in the excretion of urinary TAP.
