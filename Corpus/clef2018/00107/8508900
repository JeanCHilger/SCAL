Acute pancreatitis following transurethral resection of prostate. Three cases of acute pancreatitis following transurethral resection of the prostate are reported. The incidence is rare. A review of perioperative data failed to disclose any unique factor except in 1 patient who had an underlying biliary tract disease. Hyperamylasemia or hyperlipaemia in association with abdominal pain and vomiting was noted in all patients to establish the diagnosis. Computed tomography also confirmed the existence of acute pancreatitis. One patient died of respiratory and renal failure. However, early diagnosis and prompt treatment are essential to reduce high mortality. In conclusion, acute pancreatitis should be considered as one of the differential diagnoses in the presence of abdominal pain with vomiting, azotemia or oliguria after transurethral resection of the prostate.
