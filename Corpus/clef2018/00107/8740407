Carboxylic ester hydrolase and amylase in ischemic pancreatitis in the guinea pig. The observation that an elevated level of pancreatic carboxylic ester hydrolase (CEH) in serum is a more sensitive and specific marker of acute pancreatitis than is elevated serum amylase activity prompted us to explore whether these findings could be confirmed in an experimental model and, if so, to find the explanation behind this difference. We therefore developed a model for ischemic pancreatitis in the guinea pig and a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for determination of CEH in this species. There was a strong correlation between duration of ischemia and severity of pancreatic inflammation and between severity of inflammation and serum CEH level. In contrast, serum amylase was elevated only in animals with the most severe grade of inflammation. Amylase was, however, increased in urine in animals with mild inflammation, but the level did not increase with severity of inflammation. Only one of 31 animals had detectable CEH in urine. In animals with intermediate serum CEH levels the serum and biliary concentrations correlated, indicating that CEH may be cleared by the liver. Amylase was detectable in bile only in animals with high serum levels. The results confirm our observations made in previous clinical studies. A likely explanation for differences in serum levels of CEH and amylase is clearance from the circulation at different rates and, at least partly, via different routes, e.g., the liver and kidney, respectively.
