Serum procarboxypeptidase B, amylase and lipase in chronic renal failure. Procarboxypeptidase B (human pancreas-specific protein) has been reported to be a good serum marker for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. The current study was conducted in order to evaluate the frequency and degree of elevated serum levels of procarboxypeptidase B in chronic renal failure and their correlations with serum levels of amylase, lipase and renal function tests. Blood samples were taken from 84 asymptomatic patients with chronic renal failure, including 34 patients with periodical haemodialysis and 50 patients without haemodialysis. Serum levels of procarboxypeptidase B, amylase, lipase, creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were measured. Serum levels of procarboxypeptidase B in 84 patients were 63.4 +/- 5.5 micrograms/L significantly greater than the figure of 29.6 +/- 1.6 micrograms/L in healthy adults in our previous report (P < 0.0001). There was a significant difference in serum levels of PCPB between patients with and without haemodialysis (78.0 +/- 9.4 vs 53.6 +/- 6.3 micrograms/L P < 0.01). The frequencies of elevated serum levels of procarboxypeptidase B, amylase and lipase greater than upper normal limits were 27.4, 35.7 and 26.2%, respectively. The frequencies of elevated PCPB in patients with and without haemodialysis were 38.2 and 20%, respectively. Only one patient had a serum procarboxypeptidase B level greater than three-fold the upper normal limit. A significant correlation was found between procarboxypeptidase B and lipase (r = 0.785
