Pancreatic secretion in hamsters with pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic secretory abnormalities develop in most persons with pancreatic cancer and have been attributed to ductal obstruction. These experiments investigated whether abnormal secretion results instead from carcinogen-induced changes in the secreting cells. Fifty male Syrian Golden hamsters (40 to 100 grams) received weekly injections of di-isopropyl-nitrosamine (250 mg/kg, subcutaneously), and survivors and age-matched controls were studied after 3.5 to 6.5 months of treatment. Pancreatic secretion was stimulated by secretin or cholecystokinin (2 units/kg, intravenously, as a bolus). After each stimulus four 15-minute collections of pancreatic juice were analyzed for HCO3- and Cl- or total protein, amylase, trypsin, and chymotrypsin. The organs were examined histologically. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma developed in 30% of the animals at 5 months, 56% at 5.5 months, and 100% at 6.5 months. The animals without cancer either had hyperplasia of the duct epithelium or were histologically normal. The histologic appearance of acinar tissue and protein secretion were normal in all groups. The tumors did not obstruct the major ducts. In all treated animals the pancreatic secretory response to secretin was of low volume, low maximal [HCO3-] and HCO3- output, and low [Cl- + HCO3-] these changes progressed with time. The secretory abnormalities antedated the appearance of the neoplasms and were not caused by obstruction.
