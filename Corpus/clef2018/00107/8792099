High-fat hypercaloric diet induces obesity, glucose intolerance and hyperlipidemia in normal adult male Wistar rat. There is strong evidence that genetic factors contribute to the development of obesity in humans as well as laboratory animals. Another important factor leading to obesity is an increase in energy intake. However, it is difficult to make normal rats obese by controlling daily food intake. There is no report of normal adult male Wistar rats becoming obese and diabetic on a high-fat diet. The aim of the present study was, therefore, to make normal adult Wistar rats obese by infusing high fat and hypercaloric diet through the cannula without disturbing the free movement and to investigate the influence of an increase in the caloric intake on body weight and glucose metabolism. High-fat hypercaloric diet (360 kcal/kg body wt./day H group) or control diet (180 kcal/kg body wt./day
