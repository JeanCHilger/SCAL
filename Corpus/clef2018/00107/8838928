Fat necrosis with features of erythema nodosum in a patient with metastatic pancreatic carcinoma. A 59-year-old man presented with painful subcutaneous nodules on the anterior surfaces of the legs. He had received oral antibiotics and supportive care for presumed cellulitis and thrombophlebitis, but had minimal improvement. Five months earlier, he had undergone pancreaticoduodenectomy for acinar pancreatic carcinoma at that time, the serum level of amylase had been normal, but the level of lipase was elevated. The patient denied fever, rigors, arthritis/arthralgia, or pleuritic pain. His medications included aspirin, furosemide, ranitidine, and nortriptyline. He denied any allergies. Physical examination revealed numerous firm, tender, erythematous and violaceous, subcutaneous nodules on the lower extremities, with marked bilateral pitting edema (Fig. 1). Skin biopsy of a representative lesion revealed septal panniculitis, consistent with erythema nodosum (Fig. 2). None of the characteristic changes of pancreatic fat necrosis was present. The patient was treated with aspirin, 650 mg orally, q 6 h, and indomethacin, 50 mg orally, q 12 h, but he continued to develop new nodules
