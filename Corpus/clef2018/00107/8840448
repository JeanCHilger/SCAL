Sequential endoscopic-laparoscopic treatment of cholecystocholedocholithiasis. Preoperative common bile duct (CBD) clearance with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) is routinely performed in many centers where laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is the procedure of choice for the treatment of cholelithiasis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate prospectively the results of the sequential endoscopic-laparoscopic management in patients with gallstones and suspected CBD stones. From November 1990 to May 1993, 700 consecutive patients were evaluated for LC. Preoperative workup included clinical history and physical examination serum levels of bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and amylase
