Endoscopic fibrin gluing of a pancreatic duct fistula following acute pancreatitis. A 45-year-old patient was admitted because of frequent attacks of upper abdominal pain after food intake. The pain episodes had started shortly after a bout of acute pancreatitis. Physical examination was unremarkable except for mild pain on palpation of the left lower abdomen.Amylase and gamma-glutamyl transaminase activities as well as inflammatory parameters were slightly raised. Ultrasonography was suggestive of a circumscribed area of necrosis in the tail of the pancreas, a finding confirmed on endoscopic retrograde injection of contrast medium, which passed into the necrotic cavity via a fistula.The fistula failed to close during 12 days of conservative treatment (total parenteral nutrition 2 g ceftizoxim twice dailyA previously treatment-resistant pancreatic fistula can be successfully occluded by injection of fibrin glue by retrograde endoscopy, obviating surgical intervention with subsequent reduction in glandular capacity.
