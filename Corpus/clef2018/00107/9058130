Protecting effects of intravenous insoluble glycogen treatment on the experimental necrotizing acute pancreatitis of dogs. We have studied the effects of insoluble glycogen applied intravenously on the experimental acute pancreatitis of dogs.Experimental acute pancreatitis was induced by olive oil injected into the main pancreatic duct. The effects of insoluble glycogen were evaluated histologically and by measurements of levels of amylase, lipase in sera. The binding of endotoxin and secretable phospholipase A2 by insoluble glycogen were tested by isotopically labeled materials.Application of insoluble glycogen had beneficial effects on the experimental acute pancreatitis of dogs.The binding capacity on endotoxin and secretable phospholipase A2 could play the main role in the protection offered by insoluble glycogen.
