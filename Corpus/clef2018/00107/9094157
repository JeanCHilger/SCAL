Effects of propentofylline on tumor necrosis factor-alpha and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant production in rats with cerulein-induced pancreatitis and endotoxemia. We investigated the effects of the xanthine derivative propentofylline on lung injury in rats with cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis and endotoxemia. Pancreatitis was induced by four intramuscular injections of cerulein (50 micrograms/kg at 1-h intervals). Pancreatitis rats were injected intraperitoneally with 30 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 6 h following the first cerulein injection as a septic challenge. Propentofylline (50 mg/kg) was injected intravenously 15 min before the administration of LPS. Rats were divided randomly into five experimental groups: group I, normal rats group II, pancreatitis
