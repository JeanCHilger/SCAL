Octreotide: effects in experimental severe acute pancreatitis. Analysis of survival, biochemical findings and histomorphometry. The effect of octreotide in acute experimental pancreatitis was examined.Acute pancreatitis was induced in 70 male Wistar rats by retrograde injection of 5% sodium taurocholate into the pancreatic duct. Octreotide (50 micrograms = 0.5 ml) or isotonic saline was administered subcutaneously every six hours for 24 hours, beginning at the time of induction of pancreatitis (groups 1 and 2) or 12 hours later (groups 3 and 4). Six hours after the last dose of octreotide or saline, the rats were sacrificed. Ten additional rats were used for basal biochemical determination. For the analysis of survival, another 10 rats were included. The survival rate, serum concentrations of amylase, lipase and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and morphometric studies (total area of the pancreas and percentage necrosis) were examined. Statistical analysis involved Student's t test, ANOVA and the Mantel-Haenszel test.No significant differences existed among the groups with respect to survival, morphometric analysis or biochemical determinations, except for a minor increase in LDH levels in the group treated with octreotide at the time of induction.Octreotide administration has almost no impact on mortality in experimental severe acute pancreatitis. Biochemical and morphometric changes are minimal. Therefore, according to the present study, the efficacy of octreotide administration is very low.
