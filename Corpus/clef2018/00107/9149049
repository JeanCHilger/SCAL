Differential effect of nitric oxide inhibition as a function of preservation period in pancreas transplantation. The role of nitric oxide, produced during reperfusion as a function of preservation time, in the development of the inflammatory process in pancreas transplantation has been explored. For this purpose, the effect of nitric oxide synthase inhibition, as well as 6-keto-prostaglandin F1alpha, leukotriene B4, and lipoperoxidation levels were evaluated in an experimental model of rat pancreas transplantation after different periods of cold preservation. The results show posttransplantation increases in 6-keto-prostaglandin F1alpha, leukotriene B4, and lipoperoxidation levels in pancreatic tissue and in plasma lipase. When ischemia was induced for 30 min, nitric oxide synthase inhibition prevented these increases, and L-arginine was able to reverse this effect. By contrast, nitric oxide synthase inhibition has no effect when ischemia was prolonged for 12 hr. In summary, this study suggests that, during reperfusion, nitric oxide modulates 6-keto-prostaglandin F1alpha synthesis, lipoperoxidation levels, and the development of pancreatic injury but only when the ischemic period is quite short.
