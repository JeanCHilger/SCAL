Classification of acute pancreatitis and the role of prognostic factors in assessing severity of disease. Clinical assessment of acute pancreatitis by experts is as accurate as any of the individual approaches which have been recommended. What is important in a hospital setting is for one or more of these systems to be applied in individual hospitals so that forewarning is given, especially to the less experienced clinicians, of the patient who is likely to run into difficulties and requires high dependency or intensive care. One practical approach which can be personally recommended is to employ the Glasgow scoring system plus C-reactive protein levels and also to take into account body mass index. Any patient with three positive Glasgow factors, or CRP > 150 mg/l or BMI > 30 kg/m2 has severe acute pancreatitis. More refined systems may ultimately be developed but we are still some way from a single substance in blood or urine being easily and cheaply measured and representing an accurate prognostic indicator of severe acute pancreatitis. Part of the journey has been completed but there is still considerable potential to make the rest of the journey an improvement for both clinicians and patients.
