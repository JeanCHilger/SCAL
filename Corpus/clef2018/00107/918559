Amylase thermolability in body fluids. The thermolability of amylase was measured in saliva, pancreatic juice, urine, adult and neonatal sera. The mean percentage thermolability from these fluids was 100%, 99%, 87%, 44% and 23% respectively. In patients with acute pancreatitis and mumps the amylase was 84% and 83% thermolabile during the acute phase. On resolution of the pancreatitis this dropped towards normal. Patients with a pancreatic pseudocyst showed a high mean percentage thermolability (82%). These results could suggest that a component of amylase in human serum is not of pancreatic or salivary origin. In addition, this simple technique may be helpful in the diagnosis of pancreatic pseudocyst.
