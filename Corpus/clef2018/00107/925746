Pancreatitis following spinal cord injury. Six cases of pancreatitis following spinal cord injury are presented. No single, etiologically accepted mechanism already postulated to cause pancreatitis can account for all the cases reported. The authors hypothesize that spinal cord disruption may produce pacreatitis by sympathetic-parasympathetic nervous system imbalance resulting in over-stimulation of the sphincter of Oddi. This may lead to stasis of secretions with absorption of amylase into the systemic circulation, and structural pancreatic damage. Pancreatitis in those with cord injuries is easily overlooked because abdominal pain is usually absent and fever is usually attributed to more frequently occurring pulmonary or urinary tract infections. Recognition of this complication is important in order to decrease the morbidity and mortality that follows spinal cord damage.
