Eosinophilic gastroenteritis presenting with acute pancreatitis. We present the findings on a 27-year-old male with eosinophilic gastro-enterocolitis accompanied with acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis may be induced by pancreatic duct obstruction caused by marked swelling of the papillary region of the duodenum due to eosinophil infiltration. After prednisolone treatment, clinical manifestations rapidly improved the serum amylase decreased and the peripheral eosinophilia was recovered. The serum interleukin-5 (IL-5) level was high at diagnosis and decreased by prednisolone therapy
