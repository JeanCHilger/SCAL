Small molecule inhibition of tumor necrosis factor gene processing during acute pancreatitis prevents cytokine cascade progression and attenuates pancreatitis severity. The morbidity and mortality associated with acute pancreatitis are primarily a result of pancreatic parenchymal necrosis and the development of marked pulmonary dysfunction. Recent evidence suggests that both of these conditions are propagated by interleukin (IL)-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, which are produced in large quantities within these organs. Because the generation of these cytokines occurs in a predictable manner early in the development of acute pancreatitis, we aimed to determine whether cytokine gene processing could be inhibited in vivo and what effects this would have on pancreatitis severity.
