Duodenal secretion of phospholipase A2, amylase, and bicarbonate in chronic pancreatitis. Phospholipase A2 has been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis. We determined phospholipase A2 and amylase activities in duodenal juice collected during a secretin test from 30 consecutive patients who were suspected to have chronic pancreatitis or biliary disease. The patients underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) the following day. In the 8 patients with ERCP findings of advanced chronic pancreatitis, the mean outputs of phospholipase A2, amylase, and bicarbonate were reduced by 74%, 72%, and 60% compared to the respective values in the 13 (control) patients without a diagnosis of any pancreatic disorder or jaundice. In the 3 patients with recurrent pancreatitis but normal ERCP findings and in the 6 patients with jaundice the output values were not significantly reduced compared to those in the patients without any pancreatic disorder or jaundice. The outputs of amylase and phospholipase A2 were not significantly interrelated, whereas the outputs of phospholipase A2 and bicarbonate correlated well. Receiver characteristic (ROC) curves confirmed the high specificity and sensitivity of phospholipase A2 or bicarbonate output in patients with ERCP findings of advanced chronic pancreatitis compared to those with no changes in pancreatic ducts, with similar probability values of 0.880 +/- 0.111 (SEM), compared to the respective lower value of amylase, 0.676 +/- 0.118. Phospholipase A2 and bicarbonate output proved of equal value as markers of chronic pancreatitis and were superior to amylase output in the secretin test.
