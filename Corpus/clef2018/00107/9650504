Endogenous levels of somatostatin, C-peptide and insulin in acute pancreatitis. The authors compared in seven patients with acute pancreatitis the levels of endogenous somatostatin, insulin and C-peptide to assess their mutual correlation and relation to the development of the disease and serum amalyse levels. The results were compared with values recorded in 11 healthy volunteers. The levels of endogenous somatostatin were in patients with acute pancreatitis significantly higher (p < 0.05) than in the control group. The authors found an inverse relationship between the somatostatin and amylase level (correlation coefficient 0.75). They did not observe a significant correlation between somatostatin and insulin levels nor between somatostatin and C-peptide levels. The elevated somatostatin level may be due to the counteregulatory reaction during secretion, stimulated by endogenous or exogenous factors (cholecystokinin, alcohol, food).
