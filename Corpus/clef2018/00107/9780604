Pancreatic pseudocyst involving the spleen. The pseudocyst of the pancreas is a frequent complication of acute pancreatitis. The splenic involvement from the pancreatic pseudocyst is an uncommon entity. A 40-year-old man, who had a five-year history of alcohol consumption, was referred to our hospital for treatment of throbbing pain over left upper quadrant (LUQ) of the abdomen. Except for LUQ tenderness, physical examination was essentially normal. MRI showed two cystic lesions in splenic hilum and pancreatic tail, and prominent vessels in left infrasplenic area and gastrosplenic ligament. Angiography revealed splenic vein thrombosis. Because of persistent LUQ pain, he underwent laparotomy. During the operation, we found the cysts in pancreatic tail and splenic hilum. The cystic content was aspirated to check amylase, which showed the level of amylase being as high as 20,000 IU/L. The diagnosis of a pancreatic pseudocyst involving the spleen was established. Splenectomy and distal pancreatectomy were performed to remove both cysts. The pathologic examination of the resected spleen showed splenic infarction with cyst formation and pancreatic pseudocyst. The patient recovered uneventfully after operation.
