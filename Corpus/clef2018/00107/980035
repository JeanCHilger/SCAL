Mechanism of increased renal clearnace of amylase/creatinine in acute pancreatitis. We investigated three possible causes of the increased ratio of amylase/creatinine clearance observed in acute pancreatitis. The presence of rapidly cleared isoamylase was excluded by studies of serum and urine, which demonstrated no anomalous isoamylases. In pancreatitis, the ratios (+/-1 S.E.M.) of both pancreatic isoamylase (9.2+/-0.6 per cent) and salivary isoamylase (8.6+/-1.6 per cent) were significantly (P less than 0.01) elevated over respective control values (2.4+/-0.2 and 1.8+/-0.2 per cent). Increased glomerular permeability to amylase was excluded by the demonstration of normal renal clearance of dextrans. We tested tubular reabsorption of protein by measuring the renal clearance of beta2-microglobulin, which is relatively freely filtered at the glomerulus and then avidly reabsorbed by the normal tubule. During acute pancreatitis the ratio of the renal clearance of beta2-microglobulin to that of creatinine was 1.22+/-0.52 per cent, an 80-fold increase over normal (0.015+/-0.002 per cent), with a rapid return toward normal during convalescence. Presumably, this reversible renal tubular defect also reduces amylase reabsorption and accounts for the elevated renal clearance of amylase/creatinine observed in acute pancreatitis.
