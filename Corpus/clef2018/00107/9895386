Inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB activation improves the survival of rats with taurocholate pancreatitis. Death in the early stages of severe acute pancreatitis is frequently the result of multiple organ dysfunction, but its mechanism is not clear.To investigate the state of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) in macrophages of rats with lethal pancreatitis, and to assess the effectiveness of pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, an inhibitor of NF-kappaB, on the pathology and mortality.Taurocholate pancreatitis was produced in rats, and the severity of the disease, the mortality, and activation of NF-kappaB in peritoneal and alveolar macrophages were compared in rats receiving pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) treatment and those that were not.Taurocholate pancreatitis produced massive necrosis, haemorrhage, and severe leucocyte infiltration in the pancreas as well as alveolar septal thickening in the lung. NF-kappaB was activated in peritoneal and alveolar macrophages six hours after pancreatitis induction. Pretreatment with PDTC dose-dependently attenuated the NF-kappaB activation and improved the survival of the rats, although it did not affect the early increase in serum amylase and histological findings.Early blockage of NF-kappaB activation may be effective in reducing fatal outcome in severe acute pancreatitis.
