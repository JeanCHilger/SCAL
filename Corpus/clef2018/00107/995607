Effusions rich in amylase without pancreatitis. 14 cases. This study involved 14 cases or pleural effusions or ascites rich in amylase and unrelated to chronic pancreatitis, a pseudo-cyst of the pancreas or acute pancreatitis. A pleural effusion rich in amylase may be secondary to a pancreatic neoplasm but this possibility seems rare. Amylase-containing effusions related to a nonpancreatic neoplasm are more common. The lesion is in general an advanced pleuro-pulmonary carcinoma, frequently an adenocarcinoma. The amylase activity of neoplastic effusion fluid is significantly increased but although levels similar to those of certain pancreatic effusions may be seen, very high figures would appear to be rare. Finally, two cases of amylase-rich pleural effusions were related to a pleuro-digestive fistula and one left-sided effusion was secondary to abdominal trauma.
