Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia in children. Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae are frequently involved in lower respiratory tract infections in children. Their responsibility must be evoked whenever an antibiotic treatment has been prescribed for a suspected bacterial origin, without clinical improvement (persistent fever particularly) after 48 hours. This must lead to the prescription of a macrolide.
