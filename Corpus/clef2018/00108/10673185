Alveolar fibrin formation caused by enhanced procoagulant and depressed fibrinolytic capacities in severe pneumonia. Comparison with the acute respiratory distress syndrome. Changes in the alveolar hemostatic balance in severe pneumonia were compared with those in the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Analysis was performed in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) of patients with ARDS triggered by nonpulmonary underlying events in the absence of lung infection (ARDS n = 25), pneumonia demanding mechanical ventilation (PNEU-vent
