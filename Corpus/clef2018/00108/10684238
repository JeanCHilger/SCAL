Irrigation drainage and fibrinolysis for treatment of parapneumonial pleural empyema. We report on our experiences on 336 patients suffering from manifest pleural empyema within a period of 10 years (1985-1995). Considering the pathogenesis, particularly the results of 218 patients with "parapneumonic pleural empyema" were analysed retrospectively. Definite healing could be achieved by chest tube placement and pleural irrigation in 201 patients (= 92.2%). Other 11 patients finally needed surgical interventions (= 5%). Only 6 patients could not be cured: An indwelling tube was palliatively inserted once and 5 patients died in the course of the medical treatment (mortality = 2.3%). Within the first years the irrigation therapy was performed using a single chest tube (n = 38%) but since 1989 a double-lumen drainage was used (n = 158). Since 1987 in most cases (n = 182) intrapleural medicinal fibrinolysis was performed by instillation of streptokinase (Varidase N). If outward invasively pretreated patients (n = 30) are analysed separately, a statistical dependency can be found between the duration and the way of treatment. Without significant difference between the groups (Gr) the average duration of treatment using a single tube without fibrinolysis (Gr1) was 31.8 days, but 26.5 days using a single tube combined with fibrinolysis (Gr2). A clear shortening of the duration is detectable if patients were treated with a combination of double lumen drainage and fibrinolysis: If 2 tubes were used (Gr4) the treatment lasted 20.6 days, using one double-lumen tube (Gr5) it took 19.8 days. There is a proof of significance at comparison of Gr4 with Gr1 (p = 0.005). Gr5 with Gr1 (p < 0.001) and Gr5 with Gr2 (p = 0.014) respectively. A significant longer duration of treatment (40.6 days, p < 0.001) is found for the group of the pretreated patients, if compared with the corresponding groups Gr4 or Gr5.Parapneumonic empyemas most often can be cured by irrigation drainage. The mortality is comparatively low. The shortest duration of treatment is needed using the combination of a double-lumen tube with intrapleural instillation of a fibrinolytic agent (Varidase N). Invasively pretreated patients need significantly longer durations at same form of treatment.
