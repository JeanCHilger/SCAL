In vitro release of interleukin-15 by broncho-alveolar lavage cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with different lung diseases. IL-15 shares several biological activities with IL-2 and uses the b and g chain of the IL-2 receptor. In addition to its T-cell stimulating capacity, IL-15 exhibits regulatory properties on macrophage proinflammatory cytokine release. IL-15 is released by non-lymphoid cells, e.g. muscle cells, fibroblasts and monocytes/macrophages. In many lung diseases alveolar macrophages (AM) are activated and release pro- inflammatory cytokines. We asked whether IL-15 is released ex vivo by AM and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with inactive sarcoidosis (PSi), active sarcoidosis (PSa), tuberculosis (TB), hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HSP), cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis (CFA) and pneumonia (PN). Additionally, we examined the kinetics of the IL-15 release of these cells. During 24 hours of culture, AM from controls (CO) released 3.8 +/- 1.9 pg/ml (mean +/- SD) of IL-15, which was significantly lower than in most of the patient groups (PSa: 8.7 +/- 3.9 pg/ml, TB: 8.4 +/- 1.9 pg/ml, CFA: 5.7 +/- 1.5 pg/ml, and PN: 7. 8 +/- 2.6 pg/ml) except PSi (4.0 +/- 2.6 pg/ml) and HSP (9.3 +/- 9.5 pg/ml). PBMC from patients with PSa released significantly more IL-15 than PBMC from CO (10.8 +/- 8.9 pg/ml versus 6.9 +/- 2.2 pg/ml) whereas PBMC IL-15 release of the other groups did not differ from CO (TB: 5.7 +/- 1.4 pg/ml CFA: 4.6 +/- 1.6 pg/ml
