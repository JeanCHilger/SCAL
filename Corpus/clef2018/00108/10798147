Blood culture and respiratory syncytial virus identification in acute lower respiratory tract infection. Even though the incidence of pneumonia in developed and developing countries is similar, the mortality is five times higher in developing countries. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of bacteremia in children with acute lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and relative contribution of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). One hundred and one children under five years of age who attended a primary care level clinic with diagnosis of acute LRTI, were enrolled. Diagnosis and management of pneumonia were done according to the WHO guidelines. Two blood cultures were drawn at the time of admission. A nasopharyngeal sample was taken for detection of RSV by indirect immunofluorescence. Blood cultures were positive for pathogenic bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus) in three patients. The detection for RSV was positive in 24 patients (23.7%). The clinical and radiographic presentations were not significantly different between patients with and without RSV (p > 0.05). RSV is a common cause of LRTI in children younger than five years old. Blood cultures are not commonly positive in outpatients with acute LRTI. The practice of obtaining blood cultures in primary and secondary care clinics is not useful to guide the treatment of patients with community-acquired pneumonia.
