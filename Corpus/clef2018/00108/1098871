As part of the Pan-European multi-centre trial of doxycycline in the treatment of respiratory tract infections during the winter of 1973/1974, a field trial was carried out in Austria. 95 physicians provided 540 case reports for evaluation. Very good or good results were obtained in 93.9% of patients and the rate of improvement as indicated by fall in temperature, reduction in cough, sputum and pain, and easing of inflammatory symptoms was rapid 77.8% of patients showed complete remission of acute symptoms after 3 days of treatment. Only 5.6% of patients suffered from side-effects which were mostly mild.
