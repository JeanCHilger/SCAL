A multi-centre trial of alpha-6-desoxy-5-oxytetracycline (doxycycline). 23 physicians in Italy took part in a multi-centre clinical trial of doxycycline in the treatment of respiratory tract infections. The case records of 290 patients were assessed with respect to both subjective and objective improvement and clinical cure: most patients were considered improved by the third day and cured by the fifth. The recommended dose of doxycycline was 200 mg on the first day and 100 mg daily thereafter only 11 of the patients had to continue treatment beyond the tenth day. The antibiotic was extremely well tolerated
