Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections and exanthems. A review of the medical literature and two case reports of M. pneumoniae infections with exanthems are presented. Erythematous maculopapular and vesicular exanthems were most common. The duration of rash was more than seven days in the majority of instances, and most patients had associated pneumonia. A striking difference in prevalence and clinical symptomatology by sex was noted 16 of 20 patients analyzed were males, and they frequently dad severe mucocutaneous syndromes. In contrast, severe conjunctivitis, generalized ulcerative stomatitis, and vesicular or bullous exanthems were not seen in females. Clinicians should suspect infection with M. pneumoniae in patients with exanthem and pneumonia, although other etiologic possibilities should also be considered.
