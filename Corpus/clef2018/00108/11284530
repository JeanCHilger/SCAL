Complicated persistent patent ductus arteriosus with acute pneumonia in an adult. Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a malady usually identified during childhood. Prompt surgical correction provides definitive therapy with long-term survival. When not corrected, PDA leads to significant morbidity and mortality, making it a rare condition in the adult population. We report the case of a 44-year-old man with a history of persistent PDA admitted for worsening dyspnea and fever. Radiographic studies are illustrative of this complex syndrome. We review the complications and treatment alternatives in these patients.
