Pneumonia due to mycoplasma pneumoniae in a primary health care district. Most studies of atypical pneumonia due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae have been performed in hospitalized patients. The aim of this study was to determine the epidemiological, clinical and radiological characteristics as well as the evolution of patients with atypical pneumonia due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae in an out-of-hospital setting.A prospective observational study was conducted in 31 patients with atypical pneumonia due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae in the pediatric population of a primary health care district from May to July 1996. In all patients serological confirmation of infection by Mycoplasma pneumoniae was obtained using a complement-fixation test.The age of the children in the study ranged from 4-13 years. The most common clinical manifestations were cough (93 %), high fever (84 %) and pharyngitis (48 %). The most frequent auscultatory finding was crackles (93 %), which were bilateral in 14 patients. Clinical-radiological dissociation was found in 16 % of the children 27 (87 %) showed radiological alterations. No characteristic radiological pattern was detected because alveolar and interstitial alterations were equally frequent, with a predominance of lung base involvement (67.7 %). In all patients response to macrolides was excellent, fever abated within 48-72 h and the remaining symptoms progressively improved.Atypical pneumonia due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae normally presents in children aged more than 5 years old or in adolescents. No signs, symptoms, or radiological patterns clearly indicate the etiology. However, because of its frequency, this disease should be suspected when school-aged children or adolescents present a pneumonia syndrome. Macrolides administration
