Two cases of lymphadenopathy with liver dysfunction due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection with mycoplasmal bacteraemia without pneumonia. We present two cases of unusual manifestations of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection: lymphadenopathy with liver dysfunction without pneumonia. One was diagnosed as an infectious mononucleosis-like syndrome and the other as Kawasaki disease. Polymerase chain reaction successfully detected Mycoplasma pneumoniae DNA using blood samples. Mycoplasma pneumoniae can be included in the panel of aetiological agents in patients with lymphadenitis and hepatitis even in the absence of pneumonia.
