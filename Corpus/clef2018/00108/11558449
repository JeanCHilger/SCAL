Etiology and microbiological diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia in newborns. A comparative analysis of the cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) among premature infants in intensive care units and premature infant nurseries in 1994 (group I) and 1999 (group II) is presented. It was shown that the number of the cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia in the premature infants of group. I was 2,4 times higher than that in the group II (45.8 and 19.2 per cent respectively). A marked difference in the species pattern of the pathogens isolated from the endobronchial aspirate in 1994 and 1999 was observed. The species pattern of the isolates from the respiratory tract (Pseudomonas aeruginosa--40 per cent Klebsiella pneumoniae--31 per cent
