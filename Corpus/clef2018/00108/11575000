Respiratory problems in children after severe pneumonia. In the course of complicated pneumonia in children diffuse inflammatory infiltrations with the risk of durable destruction of lung parenchyma are confirmed clinically and radiologically. The aim of the study was an evaluation of the general health state and respiratory problems in 55 children who had been earlier hospitalized for pneumonia with signs of localized changes and severe symptoms. The evaluation was done 2-10 years after the onset of the disease. In 89.1% of children a planned treatment was continued after hospital discharge. The period of recovery lasted over 6 weeks in 50.8% of examined children, and it was shorter than 2 weeks only in 23.6% of children. The relapses of the lower respiratory tract inflammation occurred in 43.6% of children in the form of bronchitis and in 9.1% of children a recurrent pneumonia was diagnosed. Only 12.7% of children needed subsequent hospitalization for respiratory problems. In 34.5% of children a limitation of physical activity was noted. 40 children underwent a functional examination of the respiratory system. In this group 35% of children ventilation problems of restrictive character were stated, whereas in 17.5% spirometry revealed bronchial obstruction. Presented results suggest the necessity of the specialistIc care of children after severe pneumonia including the monitoring of clinical and spirometric parameters of respiratory function and adequate rehabilitation.
