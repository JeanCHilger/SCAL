Pneumonia due to viral and atypical organisms and their sequelae. Most children presenting with pneumonia in the industrialised world will have a viral or 'atypical' organism. The clinical features of these 'atypical' pneumonias may be indistinguishable from bacterial pneumonia. New diagnostic techniques such as the polymerase chain reaction may help in diagnosis and choice of treatment, where appropriate. The pathological and clinical features of infection with each agent are discussed, together with their sequelae.
