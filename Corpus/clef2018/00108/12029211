Pulmonary activity on labelled leukocyte images: patterns of uptake and their significance. The objective of this study was to characterize, and determine the significance of, pulmonary activity on labelled leukocyte images. This retrospective review included 137 immunocompetent patients who had undergone 111In labelled autologous leukocyte chest imaging and chest X-ray within 7 days. Pulmonary activity was classified as normal, focally increased, or diffusely increased. Images were correlated with chest X-rays and final diagnoses. One hundred and twelve patients (82%) had normal pulmonary activity. Seventy-six had normal chest X-rays none had pulmonary infection. Thirty-six patients had chest X-ray abnormalities
