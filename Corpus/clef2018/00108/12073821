Neonatal pneumonia caused by Trichomonas vaginalis. The authors present two cases of newborn babies infected by Trichomonas vaginalis (hereafter referred to as T. vaginalis) and suffering from severe congenital breathing difficulties and needing artificial respiration. Microscopic examination of the tracheal discharge revealed characteristically moving, flagellated, pear-shaped unicellular organisms. Cultures on CPLM medium proved the presence of T. vaginalis. During pregnancy the mothers' clinical status was negative and both of them mentioned leukorrhoea of changing intensity. They were regularly involved in antenatal care. The infection caused by T. vaginalis could be detected in the two mothers later by culture procedures.
