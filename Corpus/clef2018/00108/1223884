Difficulties in diagnosis in primary cardiomyopathies in infants (author's transl). Four children were observed in 1970-1973 in whom cardiomyopathy was diagnosed in early infancy. The symptoms were severe congestive cardiorespiratory failures accompanied by pulmonary infections. Considerable cardiomegaly, particularly the left ventricular and atrial hypertrophy, abnormal E.C.G. and mechanocardiographic records, rhythm and conduction disturbances were found in all cases.
