Serum profiles of interleukin-18 in different severity forms of human acute pancreatitis. Interleukin 18 (IL-18) is a new mediator and modulator of the immune response its role in acute pancreatitis (AP), however, has not yet been fully explained. The aim of our study was to evaluate the profile IL-18 serum concentrations in the course of acute pancreatitis.The prospective study involves 30 patients with AP (n = 15 with mild AP and n = 15 with severe AP) as well as 10 healthy subjects. AP severity was defined according to Ranson's and Balthazar's criteria, supplemented by serum CRP concentration measurements. In the course of hospitalization, 2 patients with severe AP died. Serum IL-18 and plasma polymorphonuclear leukocyte elastase (PMN-E) concentrations were measured at admission (day 1) and on days 2, 3, 5 and 10.In both the mild and the severe forms of AP, serum IL-18 concentration was significantly higher than in the healthy controls. In severe AP, serum IL-18 reached the highest levels in all observed periods compared to that in patients with mild AP. Significant correlations, calculated for day 1, were found between serum IL-18 and plasma PMN-E (Rs = 0.514. P < 0.001) and between IL-18 and CRP (Rs = 0.463, P < 0.001) levels.Serum profile IL-18 during AP indicates that this cytokine was released early after AP onset and may play the key role in inflammatory and immune response. Positive correlation between serum IL-18 and commonly known early prognostic markers of AP severity suggest that serum IL-18 concentrations may represent another early marker indicating severe course of AP.
