Steady-state free precession projection MRI as a potential alternative to the conventional chest X-ray in pediatric patients with suspected pneumonia. Magnetic resonance imaging of the lung tissue is thought to be hardly possible due to physical limitations especially the low proton density, susceptibility, and motion artifacts. The objective of our study was to evaluate and refine a very fast MR technique at a low field strength which overcomes the limitations in MR lung imaging. Thirty-five investigations were performed in 30 pediatric patients with suspected pneumonia. The MR investigations were performed in coronal slice orientation without cardiac or respiratory triggering in a low-field MR system. An optimized true fast imaging with steady precession sequence was applied. The MR images and the corresponding conventional chest radiographs were evaluated. The examination time per slice was 1.6 s. No motion artifacts could be observed. The signal-to-noise ratio for pulmonary parenchyma ranged from 4.9 to 7.1. All pathological findings of the chest X-ray images were correctly identified by the MRI (kappa=0.82-0.85). Effusions as well as small pneumonic infiltrates were more precisely detected by the MRI investigation (kappa=0.82) as compared with X-ray. Low-field projection MRI is a promising alternative to pediatric chest X-ray. Due to its short examination time, it overcomes the physical limits of usual MRI methods and provides comparable diagnostic information.
