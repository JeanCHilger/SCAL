A comparison of cefditoren pivoxil and amoxicillin/ clavulanate in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia: a multicenter, prospective, randomized, investigator-blinded, parallel-group study. Cefditoren pivoxil is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin that is approved for the treatment of pharyngitis, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, and skin and skin-structure infections.This study was conducted to examine the efficacy and tolerability of cefditoren in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Amoxicillin/clavulanate was chosen as a comparator because of its established efficacy and general acceptance as a standard of care in CAP.This multicenter, prospective, randomized, investigator-blinded, parallel-group trial compared oral cefditoren 200 and 400 mg BID with oral amoxicillin/clavulanate 875/125 mg BID for 14 days in adult outpatients with CAP.Eight hundred two patients (404 men, 398 women mean age, 50 yearsIn this study in adult outpatients with CAP, both doses of cefditoren demonstrated equivalence to amoxicillin/clavulanate based on rates of clinical and microbiologic cure. All 3 regimens were effective in resolving or improving the clinical signs and symptoms of CAP. Both cefditoren and amoxicillin/ clavulanate were well tolerated.
