Comparison between the severity criteria of the Chinese guidelines for community acquired pneumonia and Fine's risk classes. To validate the Chinese guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in evaluating severe pneumonia and hospitalization criteria for the implementation of the Chinese guidelines accordingly.The medical records of 137 inpatients with CAP in the hospital from September 1, 2001 to March 31, 2002 were retrospectively studied and analyzed with SPSS 10.0. Chi-square test and ANOVA were used to compare severity criteria of the Chinese guidelines with Fine's risk classes. Statistical differences in age, duration of hospitalization, cost, duration of intravenous therapy, number of risk factors, and the mortality of the three subgroups stratified by the severity criteria of the Chinese guidelines were also analyzed.(1) The correlation was significant between the severity criteria of the Chinese guidelines and Fine's risk classes (P < 0.001, Pearson coefficient 0.601) (2) The differences in age, duration of hospitalization, cost, duration of intravenous therapy, number of risk factors and mortality were statistically significant between patients who met the hospitalization criteria and patients who did not base on the severity criteria of the Chinese guidelines (P < 0.001). The number of risk factors and the mortality in patients with severe pneumonia were significantly higher than those in other groups (P < 0.01).The severity criteria of the Chinese CAP guidelines can differentiate patients with different risks. Fine's risk classification is useful for evaluating Chinese patients with CAP. The current Chinese guidelines for the management of CAP should be implemented.
