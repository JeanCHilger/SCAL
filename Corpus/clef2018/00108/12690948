Body image in cystic fibrosis--development of a brief diagnostic scale. For a number of reasons, body image is an important concept in behavioral medicine. First, it is known to be related to clinical phenomena such as poor self-esteem, depression, and anxiety. Second, body image has the potential to influence the patients' self-management and compliance motivation. Finally, body image can be improved through psychological and educative interventions. This study presents the development and validation of a brief, 8-item scale assessing attitudinal body image in patients with cystic fibrosis. A principal component analysis supported three domains represented by the items: evaluation/satisfaction, importance, and trust in physical functioning/health. The test-retest correlations ranged from 0.83 to 0.88, internal consistencies were above 0.70, except for the domain "importance" (alpha = 0.44). The scale scores differentiated between patients with mild and severe symptoms of the disease. Regression analyses identified body image as an important predictor of the patients' health-related quality of life. In summary, our results provide preliminary evidence for the reliability and construct, concurrent, and clinical validity of the instrument.
