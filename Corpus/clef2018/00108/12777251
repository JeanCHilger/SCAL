Aberrant lung structure, composition, and function in a murine model of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome. Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) is a genetically heterogeneous inherited disease causing hypopigmentation and prolonged bleeding times. An additional serious clinical problem of HPS is the development of lung pathology, which may lead to severe lung disease and premature death. No cure for the disease exists, and previously, no animal model for the HPS lung abnormalities has been reported. A mouse model of HPS, which is homozygously recessive for both the Hps1 (pale ear) and Hps2 (pearl) genes, exhibits striking abnormalities of lung type II cells. Type II cells and lamellar bodies of this mutant are greatly enlarged, and the lamellar bodies are engorged with surfactant. Mutant lungs accumulate excessive autofluorescent pigment. The air spaces of mutant lungs contain age-related elevations of inflammatory cells and foamy macrophages. In vivo measurement of lung hysteresivity demonstrated aberrant lung function in mutant mice. All these features are similar to the lung pathology described in HPS patients. Morphometry of mutant lungs indicates a significant emphysema. These mutant mice provide a model to further investigate the lung pathology and therapy of HPS. We hypothesize that abnormal type II cell lamellar body structure/function may predict future lung pathology in HPS.
