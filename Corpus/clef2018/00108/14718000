Clinical profile of children with nephrotic syndrome not on glucorticoid therapy, but presenting with infection. This is a prospective, hospital based study over a period of one year, to examine the clinical profile of nephrotic children not on glucocorticoid therapy, but presenting with infection.Sixty-eight children with 76 episodes of nephrotic syndrome were enrolled during the study year. They were examined for evidence of infection using clinical and investigative criteria. The children were monitored daily for proteinuria and improvement of infection. After the infection was controlled, prednisolone therapy was started in those who were not already in remission.Of the 76 episodes, eight were excluded from analysis as they had developed infection while they were on glucocorticoid therapy. Of the remaining 68 nephrotic episodes in 60 children, there was evidence of infection in 57 episodes (83.8%). Upper respiratory infection was the most common (28.0%) followed by urinary tract infection (22.8%), peritonitis (15.8%), pneumonia (14.0%), acute invasive diarrhoea (10.5%) and empyema (5.3%). Children with infection had significantly lower serum albumin and higher serum cholesterol compared to non-infected children. Of the 57 episodes with infection, remission occurred with control of infection alone in nine episodes (15.8%) and glucocorticoid therapy was not required.Infection is widely prevalent among Indian children presenting with episodes of nephrotic syndrome, even when they are not on glucocorticoid therapy. Some children may go into remission by control of infection alone. Among the infections, upper respiratory and urinary tract infections are the most common.
