Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ertapenem: an overview for clinicians. Ertapenem, a Group 1 carbapenem, is a once-a-day parenteral beta-lactam antibiotic recently licensed in the USA and Europe. Monotherapy with ertapenem dosed as 1 g once a day has been shown to be highly effective in clinical trials for the treatment of complicated infections of skin and skin structures, complicated intra-abdominal infections, community-acquired pneumonia, acute pelvic infections and complicated urinary tract infections. Dosing modifications have not been recommended for adults on the basis of gender, age, weight or liver disease. Presently there are no data regarding the use of ertapenem in children. Dose reductions are indicated for patients with advanced renal insufficiency. Ertapenem is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein or cytochrome P450 enzymes significant drug interactions between ertapenem and drugs handled by these systems are not expected.
