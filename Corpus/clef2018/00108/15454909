Short-term outcomes and their predictors for patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia. This study of patients who were hospitalized with pneumonia describes 4 short-term outcomes and the relative value of 4 variables for predicting the outcomes.We prospectively documented 4 short-term outcomes (hospital length of stay, discharge location, death, 30-day readmission) among 213 adults (mean age = 72.5 years) with pneumonia who were admitted to the hospital. Relationships between the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), preadmission walking, malnutrition, grip strength, and outcomes were examined with correlations and multiple logistic regression.The mean (SD) hospital stay was 8.8 (10.4) days. Many patients (51.6%) were not discharged to their homes 13.6% died during admission or within 30 days of discharge. Of 205 patients discharged alive, 23.9% were readmitted within 30 days. All predictor variables correlated significantly with length of stay, discharge, and death. Except for grip strength, all predictor variables correlated significantly with readmission. Regression showed that the PSI contributed significantly to the prediction of all outcomes but that other variables also contributed (R(2) =.099 [readmitted] to.484 [discharged to home]).Because malnutrition and physical performance measures independently predicted or added to the PSI's prediction of untoward outcomes, the measures merit inclusion when assessing patients with pneumonia.
