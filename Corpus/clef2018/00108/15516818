Influence of enteral nutrition on the frequency of complications in case of major burns. The objective of the study was to assess if enteral nutrition reduces the rate of severe complications and complication-related mortality in case of major burns.Two groups were included in the study. Group A was assessed prospectively and included 67 patients treated in Kaunas University of Medicine Hospital in 2000-2003. These patients received 30-40 kcal/kg/day in enteral way over the period of wound surgery. Group A was compared with Group B, which was assessed retrospectively and included 71 patients without enteral nutrition treated in 1997-1998. Groups were homogeneous by patients' age extent of general and deep burn area10 patients (15%) in Group A had pneumonia, 3 (30%) of them died 11 (16%) had lung edema, 3 (27%) of them diedEnteral nutrition statistically significantly diminished frequency of pneumonia and lung edema for burned patients. Pneumonia, lung edema, sepsis and renal insufficiency were less hazardous for life of patients with enteral nutrition (p<0.05).
