The change of cryptdin-4 mRNA expression in the intestine of mouse with experimental pancreatitis. experimental pancreatitis and explore the mechanism of bacterial translocation at the molecular level in mice with severe acute pancreatitis.Thirty-six ICR mice were randomly divided into 6 groups with 6 mice in each group. The animals in the experimental groups (from A to E) received seven intraperitoneal injections of caerulein (50 microg/kg body weight) at hourly intervals over 6 hours, and were killed at 9, 18, 24, 48 and 72 hours after the first injection. The control group (F) received intraperitoneal injection of the same volume of saline, and the animals were killed at the 18th hour after the first injection. Blood and pancreatic tissue samples were obtained after the animals were killed. Amylase and pancreatic pathological alterations were observed. The ileum sequential segments were removed from each mouse. The amplification products of RT-PCR were electrophoresed and the images were analyzed by UVI software.Acute necrotizing pancreatitis in ICR mice were induced by the intraperitoneal injection of caerulein at large doses. Markedly pathological lesions were observed at the 18th hour after the first injection of caerulein. And, intestinal cryptdin-4 mRNA expression was down regulated slightly at the 9th hour and most markedly at the 18th hour (P < 0.05). After 24 hours, the cryptdin-4 mRNA expression recovered to the normal level gradually.Acquired cryptdin-4 deficiency may play an important role in the pathogenesis of bacterial tanslocation in acute necrotizing pancreatits.
