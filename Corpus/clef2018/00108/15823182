Nasal wash as an alternative to bronchoalveolar lavage in detecting early pulmonary inflammation in children with cystic fibrosis. The aim of this study was to determine whether nasal inflammation reflects pulmonary inflammation in young children with cystic fibrosis (CF), as assessed by inflammatory markers in nasal wash (NW) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), respectively.CF patients younger than 6 years of age who were to undergo bronchoscopy for routine BAL from May 2000 to October 2001 were recruited for this study. NW was collected immediately after the patient was sedated for bronchoscopy. Total cell counts (TCC), differential cell counts and interleukin (IL)-8 levels (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) were assessed in NW and BAL.In total, 19 children with CF (mean age, 1.9 years SD, 1.7 years) were included in the study. There was a significant relationship between IL-8 and the percentages of neutrophils in NW (r (2) = 0.76When measured under 'ideal' conditions, nasal IL-8 reflects lower airway levels and may reflect the inflammatory stimulus that results in neutrophilic inflammation. These data encourage further assessment of nasal wash under clinically appropriate conditions to determine its utility for assessing inflammation in young children with CF.
