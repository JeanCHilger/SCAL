De novo mutation causing X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome: a family study in Taiwan. X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome (XHIM) is a rare primary immunodeficiency disorder caused by mutations of the gene encoding the CD40 ligand (CD40L). It is characterized by recurrent infections with markedly decreased serum IgG, IgA and IgE levels but normal or elevated IgM levels. We report the clinical manifestations and complete immune studies in the first family with molecularly proven XHIM in Taiwan. A 5-month-old boy presented with rapidly progressive pneumonia which responded poorly to antibiotics. High levels of IgM and very low levels of IgG, IgA, and IgE were noted in his plasma specimen: IgM, 128 mg/dl IgG, 18 mg/dl
