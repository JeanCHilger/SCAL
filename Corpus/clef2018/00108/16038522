Treatment of childhood complicated community-acquired pneumonia with amoxicillin/sulbactam. The clinical and microbiological efficacy, as well as the tolerability of the amoxicillin/sulbactam combination as empiric treatment for complicated community-acquired pneumonia (CCAP) were evaluated in children from 3 months to 15 years with CCAP who were randomized 1:1 to receive either amoxicillin/sulbactam or cefuroxime. Of 234 patients hospitalized with CCAP in the study period (June, 1999-April, 2002), 62 patients qualified for the study: 32 received amoxicillin/sulbactam and 30 cefuroxime. Two were excluded. Demographic and clinical data showed that both groups were comparable at entry. One etiologic agent was identified in 55% of the patients, with Streptococcus pneumoniae being the most frequent. After treatment, the days of fever, duration of intravenous treatment, and hospitalization stay were similar in both groups. Overall favorable clinical responses were comparable: 97% for amoxicillin/sulbactam vs 100% for the comparative therapy. There was good tolerance to both drugs. Amoxicillin/sulbactam produced a satisfactory therapeutic outcome similar to that of cefuroxime for treatment of CCAP, and may be an appropriate choice for the treatment of this serious pediatric infection.
