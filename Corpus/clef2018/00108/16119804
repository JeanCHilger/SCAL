Evaluation of ELISA kits for detection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae--specific IgG, IgA, IgM antibodies on the diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in children. A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the utility of Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgG (quantitative), IgA (quantitative), IgM (qualitative) ELISA kits (Medac Diagnostika, Germany) for the diagnosis of M. pneumoniae pneumonia in children under 16 years of age. This study included a total of 159 serum samples from 113 patients with acute respiratory diseases such as bronchitis, pneumonia, which were classified into three groups according to the results of a particle agglutination (PA) test as a reference method, that is, Group I (Mycoplasma-definite cases): Group I-a (paired 52 samples from 26 cases) a four-fold or greater rise of antibody from an acute phase PA titer of < or = 1:80, Group I-b (paired 12 samples from 6 cases)
