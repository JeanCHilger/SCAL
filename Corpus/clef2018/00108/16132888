Mechanical ventilation strategies and inflammatory responses to cardiac surgery: a prospective randomized clinical trial. To examine whether postoperative mechanical ventilation with lower tidal volumes (V(T)) has protective effects on inflammatory responses induced by cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery in smokers and nonsmokers.Prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial in the intensive care unit of a university hospital.We examined 44 patients (22 smokers, 22 nonsmokers) immediately after uncomplicated CPB surgery.Ventilation was applied for 6 h with either V(T) of either 6 or 12 ml/kg ideal body weight.The time course of serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, interleukin (IL) 6, and IL-8 determined 0, 2, 4, and 6 h after randomization did not differ significantly between the ventilatory strategies. By contrast, in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids sampled after 6 h only TNF-alpha levels were significantly higher in the high V(T) group than the low V(T) group (50+/-111 pg/ml vs. 1+/-7 pg/ml). IL-6 and IL-8 concentrations did not differ between groups. Subgroup analysis of patients with serum TNF-alpha level higher than 0 pg/ml after surgery revealed lower TNF-alpha serum levels during lower V(T) ventilation. All observed effects were small, independent of patients' history of smoking, and were not correlated with duration of ventilation and ICU stay.Ventilation with lower V(T) had no or only minor effect on systemic and pulmonary inflammatory responses in patients with healthy lungs after uncomplicated CPB surgery. Our data do not suggest a clinical benefit of using low V(T) ventilation in these selected patients.
