Acute pancreatitis possibly caused by allergy to bananas. We are reporting a forty-seven year old female who had three attacks of acute pancreatitis after having eaten bananas. She was treated with a light diet and intravenous fluids during each of her admissions. The treatment concluded with the disappearance of clinical symptoms such as epigastralgia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea within a few days. In addition, elevated serum and urine amylase levels returned to normal values in parallel with the clinical symptoms. The data during her three attacks of acute pancreatitis were as follows: serum total IgE level = 644 IU/mL, specific IgE to bananas = 2.18 UA/ml. No remarkable abnormalities were present in sonography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. Endoscopic examination of the upper digestive tract showed the ampulla of Vater swollen and edematous, thus a biopsy was performed. Toluidine blue staining and immunohistochemical staining against human mast cell tryptase with the biopsy specimens showed mast cells accumulating in mucosa and submucosa. By avoiding consumption of bananas, she has not suffered from any additional attacks of pancreatitis since the third attack in the last thirty-four months up to this day of December 10, 2004.
