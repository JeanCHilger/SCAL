Cortisol and its action on the glucocorticoid receptor in malnutrition and acute infection. Severe malnutrition alone is believed to cause hypercortisolemia. Cortisol's effects are mediated through the glucocorticoid receptor, which binds the hormone in the cytosol, translocates to the nucleus, and promotes gene transcription. This observational study in marasmic children with and without acute infection tested the hypothesis that marasmus is associated with hypercortisolemia, less glucocorticoid receptor, and less receptor translocation to the nucleus. Twenty-eight Malawian children participated 14 with marasmus and infection, 6 with marasmus without infection, and 8 well nourished with infection. Free serum cortisol, interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha, leucine derived from whole-body proteolysis, and the amount of whole-cell and nuclear leukocyte glucocorticoid receptor were measured upon admission. Free serum cortisol concentration was increased in marasmic and well-nourished children with infection compared with uninfected children with marasmus (14.2 [8.5, 16.3], 24.4 [15.0, 39.2], 5.1 [3.5, 7.0] microg/L, median [25th, 75th percentiles]
