Virus antibody levels in serum specimens from patients with optic neuritis and from matched controls. Virus antibody levels in serum specimens taken in acute and convalescent phases from 77 patients with optic neuritits were tested by measles hamagglutination inhibition (HI), measles hemolysis inhibition (HLI), rubella HI, parainfluenza-1 HI, Epstein-Barr immunofluorescence (IF), and against 11 other viruses and mycoplasma pneumoniae with the complement fixation (CF) technique. The virus antibody levels were indicated to be usually very stable, and a fourfold change in virus antibody levels was demonstrated in only eight patients. The virus antibody levels were compared with specimens from two carefully selected control groups. The first control group consisted of 71 healthy persons matched in age, sex and place of residence with the patients with optic neuritis. The other control group consisted of 58 patients with various neurological diseases other than multiple sclerosis (MS) or infectious diseases of the central nervous system. The patients with optic neuritis had significantly higher measles antibody titres than the two control groups in both measles HI and measles HLI tests. Also in 33 patients with optic neuritis of unknown cause, the measles antibody levels were higher than in the control groups. On the other hand, various other antibody tests showed no statistically significant differences between patients with optic neuritis and the control group.
