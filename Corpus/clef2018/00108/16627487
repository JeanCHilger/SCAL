Role of Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae in children with community-acquired pneumonia in Istanbul, Turkey. To investigate the role of Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae infection in pediatric pneumonia, in Istanbul, Turkey, we conducted a prospective study covering all the children between 2 months and 15 years hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia.A total of 140 children (85 males, median age 2.5 years) with community-acquired pneumonia were enrolled. Acute and convalescent sera were tested for IgM and IgG antibodies to M. pneumoniae (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Serion ELISA classic) and for IgM and IgG antibodies to C. pneumoniae (microimmunofluorescence, Savyon, Israel).Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was diagnosed in 38 patients (27%) and C. pneumoniae infection in 7 (5%). In 2 children M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae co infection was observed. The average age of the M. pneumoniae cases was 5.3 years and that of the C. pneumoniae was 1.5 years. The average age of pneumonia cases caused by other pathogens was 3.4 years (p<0.05). No significant difference was observed in clinical onset, signs, symptoms and laboratory parameters in children with M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae infection and in those without M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae infection.The results of this study suggest a remarkable role for M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae in childhood community-acquired pneumonia, and the knowledge of the true prevalence of these two types of infections discovered in the community might lead to modifications in the present empirical treatment of bacterial pneumonia.
