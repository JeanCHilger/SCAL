Neonatal risk factors for respiratory morbidity during the first year of life among premature infants. There have been dramatic increases in very low birth weight infant survival. However, respiratory morbidity remains problematic. The aim here was to verify associations between pulmonary mechanics, pulmonary structural abnormalities and respiratory morbidity during the first year of life.Prospective cohort study at Instituto Fernandes Figueira, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro.Premature infants with birth weight < 1500 g were studied. Lung function tests and high-resolution chest tomography were performed before discharge. During the first year, infants were assessed for respiratory morbidity (obstructive airways, pneumonia or hospitalization). Neonatal lung tests and chest tomography and covariables potentially associated with respiratory morbidity were independently assessed using relative risk (RR). RR was subsequently adjusted via logistic regression.Ninety-seven newborn infants (mean birth weight: 1113 g mean gestational age: 28 weeks) were assessed. Lung compliance and lung resistance were abnormal in 40% and 59%. Tomography abnormalities were found in 72%Upon discharge, there were high rates of lung mechanism and tomography abnormalities. More than 50% presented respiratory morbidity during the first year. Neonatal pneumonia and mechanical ventilation use were statistically significant risk factors.
