Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis associated with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis is a clinical syndrome of ophthalmoplegia, cerebellar ataxia, and central nervous system signs and is associated with the presence of anti-GQ1b antibodies. There is a clinical continuum between Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis and Miller Fisher syndrome. We describe the case of an 11-year-old boy with encephalopathy, external ophthalmoplegia, brainstem signs, and ataxia with raised titers of anti-GQ1b antibodies. He presented following a respiratory illness and had laboratory evidence of recent infection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae. M pneumoniae infection has been associated with both Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis and Miller Fisher syndrome. This is only the second case in the literature of Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis with raised titers of anti-GQ1b antibodies described in association with M pneumoniae infection. The patient responded to intravenous immunoglobulin administration.
