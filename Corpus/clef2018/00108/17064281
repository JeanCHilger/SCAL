Low mannose-binding lectin function is associated with sepsis in adult patients. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is an innate immune system pattern recognition molecule that kills a wide range of pathogens via the lectin complement pathway. MBL deficiency is associated with severe infection but the best measure of this deficiency is undecided. We investigated the influence of MBL functional deficiency on the development of sepsis in 195 adult patients, 166 of whom had bloodstream infection and 35 had pneumonia. Results were compared with 236 blood donor controls. MBL function (C4b deposition) and levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Using receiver-operator characteristics of MBL function in healthy controls, we identified a level of <0.2 U microL(-1) as a highly discriminative marker of low MBL2 genotypes. Median MBL function was lower in sepsis patients (0.18 U microL(-1)) than in controls (0.48 U microL(-1), P<0.001). MBL functional deficiency was more common in sepsis patients than controls (P<0.001). MBL functional deficient patients had significantly higher sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores and higher MBL function and levels were found in patients with SOFA scores predictive of good outcome. Deficiency of MBL function appears to be associated with bloodstream infection and the development of septic shock. High MBL levels may be protective against severe sepsis.
