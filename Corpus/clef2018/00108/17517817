Frequency of Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections in children. Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae are among the most important pathogens of acute respiratory infections in children between the ages of 5 and 15 years. We aimed to investigate seasonal frequency of respiratory infections caused by C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae, frequency of coinfection, clinical findings and to determine relationship between clinical findings and laboratory results.Total of 284 patients (ranging 5-15 years of age), admitted to out-patient clinic with symptoms of respiratory tract infections between January 2004 and June 2005, were enrolled in the study. IgA, IgG and IgM antibodies against C. pneumoniae were quantitatively detected in all serum samples by using microimmunofluorescence (MIF). For the M. pneumoniae infection an IgM titer in the ELISA test were analyzed. Nasopharyngeal smear samples were collected for PCR detection.Mean age was 8 +/- 2.2 (range 5-14) years. Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM in 86 (30.2%) cases, C. pneumoniae IgM in one (0.3%) case, IgA in six (2.1%) cases and IgG in 10 (3.5%) cases were found positive. In 10 (3.5%) cases, both C. pneumoniae IgG (a titer of >1/216) and M. pneumoniae IgM were found positive concomitantly. The M. pneumoniae IgM in winter was found significantly higher compared to other seasons. Mycoplasma pneumoniae PCR method was performed on a total of 203 samples in 33 (16.2%) of which M. pneumoniae was found positive. The false positive ratio of PCR technique was found 16.2%. In a total of 217 examined samples by PCR method, the DNA of C. pneumoniae was found positive in two patients.Mycoplasma pneumoniae was a common pathogen in respiratory infections. The otherwise C. pneumoniae infections were rarely seen in children. A Comparison of serology diagnostic tests for M. pneumoniae infections was found more sensitive and specific than PCR.
