Daily versus weekly azithromycin in cystic fibrosis patients. Four randomised, placebo-controlled trials have previously documented the clinical benefits of azithromycin (AZM) in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. The present study examined whether the beneficial effect of AZM is equivalent when administered daily or weekly. A double-blind, randomised study was carried out in 208 CF patients aged 6-58 yrs who were assigned to AZM either 250 mg daily (n = 103) or 1,200 mg weekly (n = 105) for 6 months, with assessments at baseline and at 1, 3, 6 and 7 months. Patients were taken from five adult and children CF centres in South-east Queensland, Australia. Equivalence was demonstrated between the two groups (daily versus weekly) with respect to improvements in lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second and forced vital capacity), C-reactive protein, days spent in hospital, admission rates and nutrition (body mass index, z-scores) using 95% confidence intervals with a tolerance interval of +/-10%. In patients aged <18 yrs the daily group had significantly better improvements in z-scores for height and weight after 6 months. In children, a nutritional advantage for daily administration was found. Gastro-intestinal adverse effects were more common with weekly therapy. Apart from these findings, daily and weekly administered azithromycin demonstrated similar outcomes for cystic fibrosis patients.
