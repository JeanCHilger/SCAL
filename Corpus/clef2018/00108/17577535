Adolescents' beliefs about preferred resources for help vary depending on the health issue. Adolescents' health care use is less than ideal, especially for more sensitive services. We know little about adolescents' preferred resources for help for health-related issues, and whether these resources vary by problem type. This study examined whether adolescents' preferred resources for help differed depending on the health issue studied.Two hundred ten high school students (54% females 76.6% participation rate) completed a self-administered survey of four separate age- and gender-specific health case scenarios: an adolescent who has symptoms of pneumoniaMost adolescents believed it somewhat or very important to get help in general for all scenarios (94% pneumonia 81% cigaretteAdolescents' preferred resources for help differ depending on the health issue in question, with adolescents preferring informal resources (friends and partners) and significant adults (parents) to go to for help for nonphysical health-related issues and physicians for physical health-related issues. Future preventive service efforts and research should also consider the importance of age and gender when examining adolescents' preferred resources for help.
