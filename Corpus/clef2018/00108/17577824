Monocyte CD14 and soluble CD14 in predicting mortality of patients with severe community acquired infection. Monocyte membrane CD14 (mCD14) and soluble CD14 (sCD14) both associate with poor outcome in sepsis. Because the value of combined use of the markers is unknown we measured both in patients with severe community acquired infections. The study comprised 142 acutely ill patients with community acquired pneumonia and/or blood culture-positive sepsis. Expression of mCD14 was measured, on admission to hospital, by whole blood flow cytometry and sCD14 by ELISA. There was no significant correlation between mCD14 and sCD14. Patients in the lowest tertile of mCD14 were 9.79 times (95% CI 1.31- >50, p =0.006) more likely to die than patients in the middle/highest tertiles. Survival rates in the highest and middle/lowest tertiles of sCD14 levels were comparable. After stratification by sCD14, patients in the lowest tertile of mCD14 were 14.4 times (95% CI 1.90-39.44) more likely to die than patients in the middle/highest tertiles. A significant positive correlation was detected between C-reactive protein and sCD14 levels, providing evidence that sCD14 may serve as an acute phase reactant. In conclusion, low monocyte mCD14 level, unlike the concurrent sCD14 level, predicts 28-d mortality in patients with community acquired infections.
