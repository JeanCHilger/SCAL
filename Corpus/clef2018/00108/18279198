HsCRP levels: measurement of airway inflammation in asthmatic children. The inflammatory marker, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HsCRP), is known to be related to non-allergic asthma, obesity, cardiovascular disease and smoking in adults. The aim of the present study was to determine whether HsCRP is related to respiratory symptoms and pulmonary function test findings in asthmatic children.HsCRP was measured in 63 asthmatic children aged 2-12 years. The measurements were performed in 37 children during an episode of acute exacerbation and in 42 children during remission.HsCRP level (14.28 +/- 8.45 mg/L) during exacerbation was significantly higher than the mean level (1.92 +/- 3.16 mg/L) during remission (P < 0.0001), with the decrease being more prominent in children with a low body mass index percentile (P < 0.05). A reciprocal relationship was found between forced expiratory volume in 1 s and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein values (P > 0.049).Elevated HsCRP levels were significantly associated with respiratory impairment in children.
