Respiratory symptoms in the general practice. An analysis of the Leipzig SESAM Study. The Saxon Study of General Medicine (SESAM) investigated the reasons why patients consulted the general practitioner, which diagnoses were established and how the patients were subsequently treated. In the majority of cases, the respiratory symptoms were simple infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract. Pneumonia must always be considered, while severe pulmonary diseases are of no significance in the differential diagnosis of respiratory complaints in the general practice.
