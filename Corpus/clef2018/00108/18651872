Transplant-associated Ochroconis gallopava infections. Ochroconis gallopava is a neurotropic dematiaceous mold that causes respiratory and central nervous system (CNS) infection in domestic poultry and in immunocompromised patients. We recently treated 3 solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients for pulmonary Ochroconis infections with successful outcome, prompting us to review the literature on this unique pathogen.We reviewed all published cases of O. gallopava infections in SOT recipients and analyzed the impact of CNS infection on the outcome.In addition to the 3 new cases reported here, 9 published cases of Ochroconis infection were analyzed. The disease involved the lungs only in 5/12 (42%) of patients, brain in 6/12 (50%) patients, and lung and skin in 1 patient. Survival was significantly reduced with brain infection (33% vs. 100% P<0.03O. gallopava may infect SOT recipients with a particular tropism for the CNS. Early recognition of O. gallopava pulmonary infection is important, as the prognosis is excellent before dissemination to the brain.
