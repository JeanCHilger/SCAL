Disorder of fibronectin-dependent opsonization of monocytes in children in purulent pulmonary diseases and in osteomyelitis. The influence of fibronectin (FN) on phagocytic activity of monocytes in children in abscessing pneumonia and in an acute hematogenic osteomyelitis was studied. Hypofibronectinemia, which may be explained by enhanced FN consumption, occurring as a reactive fibrin creation in pathological focus, was observed during an acute phase of the disease. Hypofibronectinemia is associated with the monocytes phagocytic activity lowering. The FN preparations application (the recently freezed plasm, cryoprecipitate) is pathogenetically substantiated for hypofibronectinemia elimination. Local hypercoagulation, the local blood flow disorder promotes the local lowering of the FN level, the fibronectin-dependent mechanism inhibition by monocytes, mainly in organs and tissues, harboring significant quantity of macrophages.
