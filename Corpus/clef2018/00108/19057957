Rescue ERCP and insertion of a small-caliber pancreatic stent to prevent the evolution of severe post-ERCP pancreatitis: a case-controlled series. Recently prophylactic placement of a trans-sphincteric pancreatic stent has successfully been applied to prevent post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis. Rescue ERCP and emergency application of small-caliber pancreatic stents during the early course of post-ERCP pancreatitis as a possible endoscopic therapy has not been reported yet.All patients who underwent ERCP were hospitalized for at least 24 h, with routine laboratory testing of amylase levels. Out of 1,225 ERCPs, evolution of severe post-ERCP pancreatitis was anticipated in six consecutive patients, based on severe pancreatic pain attack, more than tenfold elevation of serum amylase levels at 8 and 24 h, and moderate rise of white blood cell (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Rescue ERCP and emergency application of small-caliber (4-5F, 4-cm, Geenen stent) pancreatic stents were successfully performed in all patients within 8-20 h after the initial ERCP.Moderate to severe papillary oedema was observed in all patients during the rescue ERCP. Pancreatic pain was promptly reduced after the rescue pancreatic drainage procedure and completely diminished within 24 h after pancreatic stenting. Serum amylase levels were exponentially reduced and normalized within 72 h in all patients no pancreatic necrosis or any other late complications were observed. Pancreatic stents could be safely removed a few days later.Rescue pancreatic stenting with small-caliber prophylactic pancreatic stents seems to be a safe and effective procedure that might be feasible to stop the evolution of severe post-ERCP pancreatitis, but prospective controlled studies are clearly demanded to support this innovative approach.
