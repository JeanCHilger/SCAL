Clinical characteristics and therapy of severe Mycoplasma pneumonia in children. To study the clinical characteristics, therapeutic regimen and outcome of severe Mycoplasma pneumonia (MP) in children.Clinical data of 79 children with MP, including 69 mild and 10 severe cases, were retrospectively analyzed. The 10 children with severe MP were followed-up.In severe MP cases, the fever duration prior to hospitalization and the total fever duration were more prolonged, peripheral blood leucocytes counts, C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate increased, and serum IgM and IgE levels increased as compared to mild MP cases. Of the 10 cases of severe MP, 4 manifested as pulmonary consolidation, 4 as pulmonary consolidation complicated by moderate to large pleural effusion and 2 as progressively worsening pulmonary radiographic findings. Nine severe MP cases were administered with glucocorticoid as well as antibiotics, and the therapeutic effect was satisfactory. In the convalescence stage, bronchofiberoscope lavages were used in 5 severe cases because of persistent pulmonary consolidation.Severe MP was characterized by rapid progression, pulmonary consolidation, moderate to severe pleural effusion, obviously increased inflammatory indexes, and poor therapeutic reaction to simple macrolide antibiotics. Besides antibiotics, glucocorticoid should be used for severe MP cases as soon as possible. For severe cases with persistent pulmonary consolidation, bronchofiberoscope lavages are recommended.
