Chlamydia trachomatis infections in neonates--overview of current laboratory diagnostics. Based on recent literature and their own laboratory experiences the author summarizes the clinical manifestations, diagnostic possibilities and the tools of prevention of neonatal Chlamydia trachomatis infection, where a potential or a verified role of this pathogen is present. Definitive diagnosis is complicated by the common phenomenon of asymptomatic, undiagnosed maternal infection, as well as by the need for adequate sample-collection and targetted screening techniques. There are only estimated data regarding the incidence of neonatal Chlamydia trachomatis infection however we do have the diagnostic tests to identify the affected neonates, who may have generally only a mild-moderate manifestation of infection in case of an early treatment. Focussed screening efforts should be made to reduce the number of infected pregnant women and thereby the vertical rate of transmission.
