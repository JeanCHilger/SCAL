Evaluation of the effectiveness of serodiagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections by ELISA in Poland in 2006-2008. This study analyses the results of over 15 thousand patients tested by ELISA against the presence of antibodies to Mycoplasma pneumoniae in Poland in 2006-2008. Most of the tested patients were hospital-treated children with lower respiratory tract infections or pneumonia. The positive results of ELISA were obtained in 4.513 (29.6%) patients. Among them IgG and IgM antibodies were diagnosed in 24.0%, antibodies only class IgG in 44.0% and only IgM in 32.0% of cases. The results of our study showed the oversensitivity of serodiagnosis of mycoplasmosis based only on the presence in the tested sera of IgG antibodies.
