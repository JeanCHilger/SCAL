Cytomegalovirus glycoprotein B genotype in hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients from China. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) can be classified into 4 subgroups based on genotype variation of the glycoprotein B (gB) encoded by UL55 gene. Little is known about the CMV gB genotype distribution and its clinical implication in patients who receive hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) in China. In this study, which comprises 101 HSCT patients with CMV infection, we have found that 36 patients (35.64%) were infected with CMV genotype gB1, 3 patients (2.97%) with gB2, 39 patients (38.61%) with gB3, 1 patient (0.99%) with gB4, and 17 patients (16.83%) were infected with mixed CMV genotypes. We also found that CMV gB3 was associated with a high risk of CMV pneumonitis nevertheless, there were no significant differences among patients with gB genotypes with respect to the other CMV diseases
