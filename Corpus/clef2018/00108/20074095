Travel-related cerebro-meningeal infections: the 8-year experience of a French infectious diseases unit. The etiological spectrum of cerebro-meningeal infections (CMI) in travelers has never been specifically analyzed.To assess the etiologies of CMI in hospitalized travelers and to propose a diagnostic approach to travel-related CMI.During an 8-year period, we retrospectively collected data on all travelers hospitalized in our department for a CMI occurring during travel or in the month after their return.Fifty-six patients (35 men and 21 women mean age 29 years (16-83)Among the diversified etiological spectrum of CMI, cosmopolitan infections are widely predominant, particularly viral infections, followed by tropical causes, of which malaria is the leading disease in returnees from endemic areas. The diagnostic approach should be driven by history and physical examination. Key investigations include: blood smear, cerebrospinal fluid polymerase chain reaction and culture as well as neuroimaging. Management should focus on curable causes.
