Necrotising pneumonia due to influenza A (H1N1) and community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus clone USA300: successful management of the first documented paediatric case. Necrotising pneumonia in young, previously healthy patients due to Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL) producing Staphylococcus aureus has been increasingly recognised. PVL pneumonia is often associated with influenza co-infection and high mortality. This case report describes the successful management of the first documented paediatric case of a previous healthy adolescent who developed necrotising pneumonia due to community-acquired methicillin-resistant (CA-MRSA) clone USA300 with pandemic influenza A (H1N1) co-infection, and highlights the importance of early recognition and initiation of appropriate therapy for this potentially fatal co-infection. PCR remains the gold standard to diagnose pandemic H1N1 since it may not be detected by rapid antigen tests. Bacterial necrotising pneumonia should be suspected in those presenting with worsening flu-like symptoms and clinical and/or radiological evidence of PVL infection (multifocal infiltrates, effusion and cavitation). These patients may benefit from the administration of toxin neutralising agents. In light of the current H1N1 pandemic, healthcare professionals will be increasingly confronted with this clinical scenario.
