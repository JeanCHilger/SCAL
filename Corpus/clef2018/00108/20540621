High prevalence of macrolide resistance in Mycoplasma pneumoniae isolates from adult and adolescent patients with respiratory tract infection in China. The resistance rate of 67 Mycoplasma pneumoniae isolates from 356 ambulatory adult patients with respiratory tract infection was 69% (46 of 67). All 46 macrolide-resistant strains harbored point mutations in the 23S ribosomal RNA gene. Patients infected with macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae required significantly longer durations of antibiotic therapy and had longer time to resolution of fever.
