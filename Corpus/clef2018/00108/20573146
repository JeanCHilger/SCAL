Community-acquired pneumonia in children: what's old? What's new? Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) still remains a significant cause for childhood morbidity worldwide. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most important causative agent at all ages. Respiratory syncytial virus is common in young children, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in schoolchildren. Paediatric CAP is universally treated with antibiotics amoxicillin is the drug of choice for presumably pneumococcal and a macrolide for presumably atypical bacterial cases. Because of globally increased resistances, macrolides are not safety for pneumococcal CAP. At present, available prospective research data on the epidemiology of paediatric CAP in western countries are from 1970s to 1980s
