Prognostic impact of bleomycin-induced pneumonitis on the outcome of Hodgkin's lymphoma. Bleomycin-induced pneumonitis (BIP) has been well described in Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) patients. The impact of BIP on patients uniformly treated with adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) is not clear previous studies have included patients treated with both ABVD and hybrid regimens. We reviewed our experience with BIP in HL to better understand the impact of BIP on overall survival. One hundred and eighty four consecutive patients who were treated with ABVD for newly diagnosed HL were eligible for retrospective review. BIP was defined by the presence of pulmonary symptoms, bilateral interstitial infiltrates on chest X-ray, computed tomography or presence of lung fibrosis on transbronchial lung biopsy, and the absence of infection. Patients were required to meet all three criteria to be included in the BIP group. BIP was observed in 28 patients (15%). A low albumin level and the use of colony granulocyte stimulating factor were associated with a higher risk of developing BIP. Age, smoking history, and underlying lung function were not predictive of BIP. Importantly, patients with BIP had similar rates of 5-year overall survival compared to unaffected patients. There were no deaths from BIP. Omission of bleomycin from subsequent treatment did not adversely affect the outcomes.
