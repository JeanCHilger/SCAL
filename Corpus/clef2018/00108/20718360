Clinical study on cross-infection of mycoplasma pneumoniae and other viruses in children. To investigate the clinical cross infections of mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) and other viruses in children, providing a reference for the diagnosis and treatment of respiratory disease.Serum specimens of the children hospitalized with fever, respiratory symptom besides positive results of MP-Ab IgM detection were collected. And several common viruses popular in children were investigated within the specimens collected by ELISA kits or indirect immunofluorescence.(1) The PCT levels of 385 cases (81.7%) appear to be under 0.5 ng/ml. (2) In the 514 cases detected for Cox-IgG and Cox-IgM, the positive rates are respectively 40.3% and 35.6%. (3) 2 cases (0.8%) appear to be influenza B virus positive. And the positive rates of parainfluenza virus 1, 2 and 3 are 0.8%, 0, and 9%. 4, 84 cases (11.8%) are positive for EB-IgM and 451 cases (63.6%) positive for EB-IgG.Cross infections rarely occur between MP and common respiratory viruses in Children. The cross-infection rate between Cox-virus and MP is up to 35.6%.
