Modern characteristics of epidemiology and prevention of community-acquired pneumonia in military staff. To study the effectiveness of system for prevention of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in military teams and determine the main ways for its improvement.Data on incidence of CAP in military staff during 1993 - 2008 were used. Analysis of morbidity was performed using classical methods of epidemiological analysis.Registered incidence of CAP in military staff was 5 - 7 times higher compared with average incidence in adult population of the country. Main factors determining realization of CAP epidemic process mechanisms in military teams were revealed. Two-fold and more rise in incidence of CAP and acute respiratory infection in military recruits is forecasted for 2010. Effect of use of Pneumo 23 vaccine for freshmen recruits is grounded.Immunization of military staff with Pneumo 23 vaccine considered effective and needed component in complex of prophylactic measures performed in troops.
