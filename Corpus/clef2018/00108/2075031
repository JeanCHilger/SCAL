Pathophysiological characteristics of various types of hemodynamics in acute bronchopulmonary diseases in infants and young children. Polycardiography, biomicroscopy and angiography of the bulbar conjunctiva were used to examine 54 children aged 1 month to 3 years in the acute period of bronchopulmonary inflammation. Diverse hemodynamic alterations were revealed at different levels of circulation, representing a successive chain of pathogenetic reactions at the basis of which there lie the adaptive mechanisms. The status of the terminal hemodynamics was analyzed in different phasic syndromes of the left ventricular systole.
