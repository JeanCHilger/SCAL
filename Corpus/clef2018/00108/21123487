Detection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in children with lower respiratory tract infections. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is known to be a major cause of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in children. We studied 75 children who had been hospitalized for community-acquired LRTIs for the detection of M. pneumoniae by serological analysis and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify a 277-base pair region of 16S rDNA gene of M. pneumoniae applied to throat swab specimens. Serological and/or PCR positive results diagnosed M. pneumoniae infection in 23 (30.7%) patients.
