Community-acquired pneumonia in patients with liver cirrhosis: clinical features, outcomes, and usefulness of severity scores. We performed an observational analysis of a prospective cohort of nonimmunocompromised hospitalized adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) to determine the epidemiology, clinical features, and outcomes of patients with liver cirrhosis. We also analyzed the prognostic value of several severity scores. Of 3420 CAP episodes, 90 occurred in patients with liver cirrhosis. The median value of the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) was 14 (range, 6-36). On the Child-Pugh (CP) score, 56% of patients were defined as grade B and 22% as grade C. Patients with liver cirrhosis were younger (61.8 vs. 66.8 yr p = 0.001) than patients without cirrhosis, more frequently presented impaired consciousness at admission (33% vs. 14%
