Selected indicators of care in patients with acute pancreatitis in the Slovak Republic. The aim of this study was to state the standard of care in patients with acute pancreatitits in the surgical wards in the Slovak republic and compare the results to the European study. We sent out 57 questionnaires to surgical wards and received 34 back (59.65%).Most wards treat 51-60 patients per year (20.59% of wards). C-reactive protein (CRP) was mainly used as a stratification system (85.29%), followed by clinical assessment (79.41%). Only 41.18% of wards use antibiotic prophylaxis and primary CT indicated only 29.41% of the Slovak wards. Non improvement of clinical state is as indication for repeated CT in 100%. Only 11.76% of wards in the Slovak republic use fine needle aspiration (FNA) to confirm infection of pancreatic necrosis. The surgical intervention was mostly (76.47%) indicated in patients with organ dysfunction and sepsis, while according to 38.24% of wards, the optimal time for intervention is between 15th and 21st day after disease onset. 44.12% of wards would treat pancreatic abscess by surgical evacuation and consecutive closed lavage, pancreatic necrosis would treat identically 50% of participating wards (Fig. 6, Tab. 4, Ref. 14).
