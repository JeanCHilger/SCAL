Analysis of clinical characteristics and antimicrobial resistance of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infections in children. This study aimed to summarize the clinical characteristics and antimicrobial resistance of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) infections in children, identify its risk factors and to raise the level of diagnosis and treatment of this disease.The data of clinical and antimicrobial susceptibility of 32 cases of CRAB and 64 cases of carbapenem-susceptible Acinetobacter baumannii (CSAB) infections as control seen between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2010 in Yuying Children's Hospital Affiliated to Wenzhou Medical College were analyzed retrospectively.Thirty-two cases of CRAB infections were identified, 21 were male and 11 female. The ages ranged from 1 day to 16 years (median age 43 days) ,among whom 14 (44%) were aged < or = 28 days 28 cases (88%) were diagnosed as hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and 4 cases (12%) had wound infection. The common primary diseases of the cases were neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (n = 12, 38%), followed by congenital heart disease (n = 5,16%) and open fractures (n = 5,16%). Before the isolation of CRAB, 10 cases (31%) had received major surgeryNosocomial infections in children due to CRAB infections mainly cause HAP and open wound infection. Previous surgery, prolonged tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation for more than 10 days and previous carbapenems therapy within 2 weeks before the isolation of CRAB were independent risk factors for CRAB infections. CRAB showed MDR or even PDR to the common antimicrobials, which made great difficulties in antibiotic choices.
