Risk factors for recurrent pneumonia in children: a case-control study. To study the risk factors for recurrent pneumonia in children without underlying diseases.A case-control study was conducted in 106 children with recurrent pneumonia (case group) and 106 age, gender- and weight-matched children with pneumonia but no recurrence (control group). The children in both groups had no underlying disease. The risk factors for recurrent pneumonia were investigated by the Chi-Square analysis and the multivariate logistic regression model.The Chi-Square analysis showed that the percentages with the history of wheezing, allergy (food or medicine) and eczema and the percentage of transient neutropenia in the case group were significantly higher than those in the control group. The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the wheezing history (OR=13.387, 95% CI: 5.541-32.343), allergic history (food or medicine) (OR=4.267, 95% CI: 2.081-8.751) and transient neutropenia (OR=3.606, 95% CI: 1.806-7.202) were the independent risk factors of recurrent pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS The wheezing history, allergic history and transient neutropenia may increase the risk of recurrence of pneumonia in pneumonic children without underlying diseases.
