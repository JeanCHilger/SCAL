Serum matrix Gla protein concentrations in patients with mild and severe acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis (AP) causes an increase in proinflammatory cytokine and acute phase protein levels. Our previous studies in AP showed the role of fetuin A as a negative acute phase protein. Matrix Gla protein (MGP), beside fetuin A, is one of the main inhibitors of extraosseous calcification. In the present preliminary study we evaluated the relationship between MGP, lipase, and inflammation in AP patients.The study included 40 patients with AP of diverse severity (28 mild, 12 severe), assessed during the early phase of AP (day 1 - day 7 of hospitalization). The concentration of MGP, fetuin A, polymorphonuclear elastase (PMN-elastase), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 18 (IL-18), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), high sensitivity tumor necrosis factor alpha (hs TNFalpha), soluble receptor of tumor necrosis factor II (sTNFRII), and neopterin were measured by ELISA kits albumin, lipase and amylase were measured on a Modular P Chemistry Analyser (Roche Diagnostica, Germany)MGP positively correlated with lipase activity (R = 0.64 p < 0.05) on day 1 after admission to hospital. Lower MGP levels were consistent with higher intensity of inflammation, as MGP significantly (p < 0.05) inversely correlated with IL-6 (R = -0.48 on day 3Our preliminary results indicate that the MGP level correlated negatively with all of the proinflammatory cytokines and acute phase proteins studied in patients with AP, and positively with lipase, fetuin A, and albumin measurements. These findings may indicate the role of MGP in calcium and phosphate metabolism disturbances in the course of AP.
