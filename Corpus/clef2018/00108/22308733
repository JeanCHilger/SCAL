Development and use of test-systems for molecular-genetic detection of out-of-hospital pneumonia agents. Search of new targets and improvements of molecular-genetic detection methods of species specific DNA fragments of out-of-hospital pneumonia (OP) infection agents in sputum.Species specific oligonucleotide primers to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Branhamella catarrhalis were selected. 103 sputum samples from OP patients and 15 from practically healthy humans were test by using PCR and bacteriological method.Mixed bacterial flora was detected by bacteriologic method in OP in 26 cases (25.2%). 14 patients (13.6%) had B. catarrhalis DNA in sputum, 12 patients (11.6%)--S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae was detected in 11 examined individuals (10.7%), K. pneumoniae (7.9%)-- in 8. In 32 cases (30%) etiology of OP could not be deciphered bacteriologically. B. catarrhalis was detected in 19 (18.5%) of OP patients, S. pneumoniae--in 17 (16.5%), H. influenzae and K. pneumoniae--in 14.5% and 12.6% (15 and 13 patients) respectively by Using the developed PCR primers. In 16.5% cases (17 patients) positive results against several bacteria species simultaneously were obtained by PCR method, in 3.9% (4 patients) P. aeruginosa was detected. CONCLUSION. Use of PCR for detection of out-of-hospital pneumonia agents DNA significantly increases informativity of the study when compared with bacteriological method.
