Clinicopathological differences between early-onset and late-onset sepsis and pneumonia in very low birth weight infants. We performed clinicopathological studies on early-onset sepsis (5 infants, less than 72 hours of life, EOS) and late-onset sepsis (15 infants, greater than 72 hours, LOS) of very low birth weight, less than 1500 g (VLBW). In EOS, the clinical features mimic the respiratory distress syndrome and hematological changes were not observed. The lungs showed slight interstitial pneumonia with structural immaturity, hyaline membranes, hemorrhage, and minimal infiltration by polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs). The pathogen was group B streptococcus or weakly gram-negative bacilli. In LOS, pneumonia proceeded to sepsis and neutropenia with elevated numbers of circulating immature neutrophils, and increased levels of C-reactive protein were observed at the onset of sepsis. Severe pneumonia with infiltration of numerous PMNs and bacterial colonies and polymicrobial infection by nosocomial pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were common. The thymus and spleen weights varied but retained normal structure in EOS. The thymus was depleted of lymphocytes, and the spleen was hypertrophic but poorly reactive against infection in LOS. The pathogenesis of EOS is regarded as being more closely correlated with lung immaturity and circulatory disorder in early life, whereas that of LOS is associated with immunological defenses of the host, potency of the pathogens, and terminal multiple organ failure.
