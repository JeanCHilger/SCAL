Investigation of Chlamydia trachomatis pneumonia in children. A neonatal pneumonia caused by Chlamydia trachomatis (C. trachomatis) is well-known. But it is uncertain whether C. trachomatis causes pneumonia in a patient over 1 year of age. Therefore, a search for serologic and cultural evidence of C. trachomatis infection in patients suffering from acute pneumonia over 1 year of age was made. We studied 183 children ages 1 to 5 year-old suffering from acute pneumonia admitted to Kousei General Hospital to assess the relation between acute pneumonia and C. trachomatis. We investigated the serologic evidence of acute C. trachomatis infections in 73 children with a persistent cough and wheezing, detecting specific IgG antibodies and IgM antibodies by microimmunofluorescence test. Serologic results signifying acute infection were observed in 4 cases (2.2%). Then we tried to isolate C. trachomatis from the cultures of nasopharyngeal swabs, specific inclusion bodies of C. trachomatis in 2 cases (1.1%) were found. Our study suggests that C. trachomatis might cause pneumonia in children over 1 year of age.
