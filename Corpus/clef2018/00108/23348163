The significance of mean platelet volume on diagnosis and management of  adenomyosis. The present study was designed to assess the significance of mean platelet volume on the pathogenesis and management of adenomyosis.A total of 26 patients out of 123 with pathologically confirmed adenomyosis in hysterectomy specimens without concomitant gynecological pathology were selected for the study. Control group was consisted of 24 symptom-free subjects out of 35, with normal smear test and without infection. Groups were compared in terms of mean platelet volumes and platelet counts.The mean platelet volume values of patients with pathologically confirmed adenomyosis were found to be significantly higher than the values in the control group (9.3±0.8 fL versus 7.3±0.8 fL p less 0.05). Platelet count comparison between the two groups showed no statistical significance (p>0.05).This study confirms the previous studies indicating endometriosis and adenomyosis as inflammatory processes. As a result, mean platelet volume has shown to be a significant clinical marker for chronic inflammatory process of adenomyosis and endometriosis. This basic finding should be supported by new studies concerning the correlation of mean platelet volume levels with severity and duration of the disease, as well as response of mean platelet volume levels to therapies targeting chronic inflammatory process in adenomyosis and endometriosis pathogenesis.
