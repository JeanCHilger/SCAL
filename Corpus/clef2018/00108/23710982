Selective progesterone receptor modulators and their therapeutical use. Currently developed selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRMs) are steroid derived compounds with a bulky radical substitution at carbon 11. They interact with progesterone receptor and exert antagonistic or/and agonistic effects. Mifepristone was approved for pregnancy termination and ulipristal acetate as emergency contraception and pharmacological therapy of uterine fibroids. SPRMs inhibit endometrial proliferation and myoma growth, this suggests a therapeutical effect in cases of endometriosis and other estrogen-dependent diseases.
