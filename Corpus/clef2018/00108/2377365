Cryptosporidium as a co-pathogen in infantile diarrhea and pneumonia. The authors describe a case of cryptosporidiosis in a 10 month old immunocompetent infant, who suffered from prolonged diarrhoea and pneumonia. Cryptosporidium oocysts, Giardia lamblia were detected by using modified Kinyoun stain, and klebsiella was identified in the stool culture. According to the clinical presentation and the laboratory data the streptococcus infection is presumed as cause of the pneumonia, but the authors could not exclude the role of cryptosporidium in predisposing and/or causing the pneumonia.
