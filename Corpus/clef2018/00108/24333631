Validity of intraoperative diagnosis at laparoscopic surgery for ovarian tumors. To evaluate the accuracy and usefulness of intraoperative diagnosis of ovarian tumor during laparoscopic surgery.Retrospective cohort study (Canadian Task Force classification II-3).Tertiary care university hospital.We reviewed the cases of 262 patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery at our institution between January 2005 and December 2011 in whom a benign ovarian tumor was diagnosed intraoperatively.Intraoperative pathologic assessment of frozen sections.Intraoperative diagnosis of ovarian tumors demonstrated sensitivity of 80%, specificity of 99.6%, positive predictive value of 80%, and diagnostic accuracy of 99.2%. Mucinous tumors diagnosed intraoperatively showed differing intraoperative and final pathologic diagnoses significantly more frequently than did other types of tumors.Intraoperative pathologic assessment of benign ovarian tumors during laparoscopic surgery is reliable. However, clinicians should recognize that it is possible to make an incorrect diagnosis in some situations and should exercise caution accordingly.
