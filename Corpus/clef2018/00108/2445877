Effects of somatostatin on acute canine experimental pancreatitis. Somatostatin is an inhibitory hormone that decreases the secretion and end organ response of cholecystokinin (CCK). Inhibition of hormonal stimulation of pancreatic exocrine secretion by somatostatin may improve the course of acute pancreatitis. Anesthetized dogs underwent cholecystectomy and cannulation of the pancreatic duct, thoracic duct, and portal vein. Twenty experiments were performed in random order with 5 dogs in each group. Hourly measurements of lymph flow and portal and thoracic duct amylase were made. Portal blood insulin, glucagon, and CCK concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay on samples obtained at the beginning and end of the experiments. Pancreatitis was induced by injecting, under constant pressure, 10 ml bile into the pancreatic duct during 1 min. Somatostatin was administered intravenously (20 micrograms/kg/hr). After 5 h, the dogs were killed, pancreas glands removed and weighed and tissue samples obtained for histologic evaluation. There was a significant increase in lymph amylase output and portal venous amylase and CCK concentrations in the dogs with pancreatitis compared to the control dogs. In dogs with pancreatitis, lymphatic amylase secretion and portal CCK concentrations were significantly decreased by somatostatin. Somatostatin did not significantly alter portal amylase concentrations, pancreas gland weights or histologic inflammation when compared to values from dogs with pancreatitis not treated with somatostatin.
