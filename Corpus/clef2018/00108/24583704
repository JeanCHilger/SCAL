Pulmonary sequestration presenting elevated CA19-9 and CA125 with ovarian cysts. A 41-year-old woman was evaluated because of elevated serum levels of the tumor markers CA19-9 and CA125. Whole-body examination revealed an intralobar pulmonary sequestration in the right lower lobe and bilateral cystic ovarian tumors (right: 20 mm, left: 60 mm in diameter, respectively). The left ovarian cyst was resected and diagnosed as an endometrioma. The right ovarian cyst was preserved because of its small size. However, the tumor marker levels remained elevated postoperatively. S10 segmentectomy of the right lung was subsequently performed. Immunohistochemical examination of the sequestrated lung demonstrated positive staining for CA19-9 in the bronchial and alveolar epithelia and mucus. After the pulmonary resection, the CA19-9 and CA125 levels decreased to their normal ranges.
