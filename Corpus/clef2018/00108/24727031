Effect of surgery for endometrioma on ovarian function: a different point of view. Recent evidence in the literature suggests that surgical excision of the endometrioma wall may reduce ovarian reserve, which may have a negative effect on subsequent reproductive function. However, because of inconsistent results and methodologic flaws of anti-m√ºllerian hormone (AMH) as a marker of ovarian reserve, antral follicle count may be a more accurate noninvasive marker than AMH. Evaluating ovarian reserve using antral follicle count rather than AMH may yield different conclusions insofar as postsurgical damage to the ovary. Surgery should be performed only by experienced surgeons, and the stripping technique currently is still the only one supported by strong scientific evidence. The dual function of surgery, that is, to improve fertility and reduce pain, cannot be minimized or undervalued.
