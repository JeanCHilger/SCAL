Evidence for different expression profiles for c-Met, EGFR, PTEN and the mTOR pathway in low and high grade endometrial carcinomas in a cohort of consecutive women. Occurrence of PIK3CA and K-Ras mutations and microsatellite instability. Molecular and genetic investigations in endometrial carcinogenesis may have prognostic and therapeutic implications. We studied the expression of EGFR, c-Met, PTEN and the mTOR signalling pathway (phospho-AKT/phospho-mTOR/phospho-RPS6) in 69 consecutive tumours and 16 tissue microarrays. We also analysed PIK3CA, K-Ras mutations and microsatellite instability (MSI). We distinguished two groups: group 1 (grade 1 and 2 endometrioid cancers) and group 2 (grade 3 endometrioid and type II clear and serous cell cancers). We hypothesised that these histological groups might have different features. We found that a) survival was higher in group 1 with less aggressive tumours (P‚ü®0.03) b) EGFR (P=0.01), PTEN and the AKT/mTOR/RPS6 signalling pathway were increased in group 1 versus group 2 (P=0.05 for phospho-mTOR)
