Intestinal endometriosis - a case report. Endometriosis is defined as the presence of functional endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity. The most common clinical symptoms of endometriosis are infertility and chronic pelvic pain. Endometriosis affects 8-10% of women of reproductive age and the condition is highly associated with infertility. Ectopic endometrial tissue is usually found in the small pelvis and the peritoneum, but endometrial tissue deposits have also been reported in other anatomical locations in the human body. We describe the case of a young patient with persistent abdominal pain and bleeding via the rectum during menstrual periods, hospitalised at the Second Department of Surgery, Pavol Jozef Šafárik University, Faculty of Medicine and Louis Pasteur University Hospital Košice.
