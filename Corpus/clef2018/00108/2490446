Pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common causative agent of community acquired pneumonia. To assess its epidemiological, clinical and evolutive features in our area, we retrospectively analyzed 88 instances which occurred during 10 years. Both sexes were similarly involved, with a higher incidence in younger patients (mean age: 22 years). A clear seasonal predominance was not detected during the study period. In nearly one half of instance there were similar respiratory episodes in the same household. Cough was a constant symptom, followed by fever and headache. The absence of leukocytosis and the presence of cryoagglutinins were suggestive data. Pulmonary infiltration in the chest radiogram was unilateral in most cases, with a segmental distribution and predominating in the lower lobes. Hilar lymph nodes, pleural effusion and cavitation were present in a limited number of instances. All patients were cured without sequelae. The occurrence of particular epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data may be very helpful in suggesting the diagnosis of pneumonia due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae.
