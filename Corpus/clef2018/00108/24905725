Efficacy of dienogest in the treatment of symptomatic adenomyosis: a pilot study. Adenomyosis is a common disorder in premenopausal women that causes dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain and menorrhagia. Considering that adenomyosis is an estrogen-dependent disease, the medical treatment is based on this hormone. Effective and well-tolerated medical treatments for symptomatic adenomyosis are needed. Dienogest, an oral progestin, has been extensively investigated in the treatment of endometriosis. In this report, we present the results on the efficacy and safety of dienogest in the treatment of symptomatic adenomyosis. Seventeen patients with symptomatic adenomyosis were included in this study, of which 15 continued dienogest for up to 24 weeks. Dienogest significantly reduced adenomyosis-associated pelvic pain as well as serum CA-125 and CA19-9 levels. It also demonstrated a modest suppression of estradiol (>50 pg/ mL), which is consistent with the findings of other reports. During treatment, five patients experienced worsening anemia because of metrorrhagia, which is the most frequent adverse effect associated with dienogest. This report suggests that dienogest is an effective and well-tolerated therapy for symptomatic adenomyosis.
