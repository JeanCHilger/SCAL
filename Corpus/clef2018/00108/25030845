Increased levels of oxidative and carbonyl stress markers in normal ovarian cortex surrounding endometriotic cysts. Many evidence support the view that endometriotic cyst may exert detrimental effect on the surrounding ovarian microenvironment so representing a risk to functionality of adjacent follicles. Patients with benign ovarian cyst (endometriotic, follicular and dermoid cysts) subjected to laparoscopic cystectomy were enrolled in the present retrospective study in order to analyze whether endometriotic tissue could negatively affect the surrounding normal ovarian cortex more severely than other ovarian cysts. To this end we carried out immunohistochemistry analysis and comparative determination of the transcription factor FOXO3A, oxidized DNA adduct 8-OHdG (8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine) and damaged proteins known as AGEs (Advanced Glycation End products) as markers of ovarian stress response and molecular damage. Our results show that all the markers analyzed were present in normal ovarian tissue surrounding benign cysts. We observed higher levels of FOXO3A (15.90 ± 0.28), 8-OHdG (13.33 ± 2.07) and AGEs (12.58 ± 4.34) staining in normal ovarian cortex surrounding endometriotic cysts in comparison with follicular cysts (9.04 ± 0.29, 2.67 ± 2.67, 11.31 ± 2.95, respectively) and dermoid cysts (2.02 ± 0.18, 4.33 ± 2.58 and 10.56 ± 4.03, respectively). These results provide evidence that ovarian endometrioma is responsible for more severe alterations to cellular biomolecules than follicular and dermoid cysts.
