Detection of the pan neuronal marker PGP9.5 by immuno-histochemistry and quantitative PCR in eutopic endometrium from women with and without endometriosis. To assess endometrial gene as well as protein expression of neuroendocrine and supposedly endometriosis-associated product PGP9.5 and pain symptoms in women with endometriosis and controls undergoing laparoscopy, using molecular biological and immuno-histochemical approaches in the same patients.Biopsy of eutopic endometrium from 29 patients by sharp curettage, and preparation of paraffin blocks. Determination of PGP9.5 gene expression and protein abundance using qPCR and immuno-histochemistry.qPCR The PGP9.5 mRNA expression level between women with (N = 16) and without (N = 13) endometriosis was not different, regardless of pain symptoms or menstrual cycle phase. PGP9.5 expression was higher in women who reported pain compared to those who did notPGP9.5 mRNA expression is increased in the proliferative phase of endometriotic women with pain. The presence of nerve fibres was demonstrated by a PGP9.5 protein signal in immuno-histochemistry and restricted to patients with endometriosis. Based on these results, however, there did not appear to be a direct association between the gene expression and protein abundance in women with and without endometriosis or those that experienced pain.
