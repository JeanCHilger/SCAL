Endometriosis: increasing concentrations of serum interleukin-1β and interleukin-1sRII is associated with the deep form of this pathology. To assess interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and its inhibitory soluble interleukin-1 receptor type II (IL-1sRII) levels into the serum of patients with various forms of endometriosis and normal women, and investigate the correlation with disease activity.In this prospective laboratory study (2005-2010), 510 women with histologically proven endometriosis and 93 endometriosis-free controls have been enrolled. Laparoscopic complete exploration of the abdominopelvic cavity and blood samples have been performed in each patient. For each serum, IL-1β and IL-1sRII have been evaluated using Elisa.IL-1β and IL-1sRII have been respectively detectable in 64% and 54.6% of serum samples from all 603 women studied. IL-1β was higher in women with deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) (mean 10.0pg/mL [0.005-416.2]) than in endometriosis-free women (mean 0.5pg/mL [0.01-1.7], P<0.01) or in women with superficial endometriosis (SUP) (mean 0.6pg/mL [0.1-2.9], P<0.01). Also, IL-1sRII was higher in DIE (mean 236.7pg/mL [0.9-6975]) than in the witness group (mean 85.0pg/mL [1-235.2], P<0.05) or in SUP (mean 85.1pg/mL [0.6-302], P<0.01).This study highlights both a marked significant increase in serum IL-1β and IL-1sRII levels in DIE compared to SUP and normal women and suggests that a defect in the control of IL-1 can impact the pathophysiology of endometriosis.
