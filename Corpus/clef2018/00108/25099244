Ovarian endometriosis signatures established through discovery and directed mass spectrometry analysis. New molecular information on potential therapeutic targets or tools for noninvasive diagnosis for endometriosis are important for patient care and treatment. However, surprisingly few efforts have described endometriosis at the protein level. In this work we enumerate the proteins in patient endometrium and ovarian endometrioma by extensive and comprehensive analysis of minute amounts of cryosectioned tissues in a three-tiered mass spectrometric approach. Quantitative comparison of the tissues revealed 214 differentially expressed proteins in ovarian endometrioma and endometrium. These proteins are reported here as a resource of SRM (selected reaction monitoring) assays that are unique, standardized, and openly available. Pathway analysis of the proteome measurements revealed a potential role for Transforming growth factor Î²-1 in ovarian endometriosis development. Subsequent mRNA microarray analysis further revealed clear ovarian endometrioma specificity for a subset of these proteins, which was also supported by further in silico studies. In this process two important proteins emerged, Calponin-1 and EMILIN-1, that were additionally confirmed in ovarian endometrioma tissues by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. This study provides the most comprehensive molecular description of ovarian endometriosis to date and researchers with new molecular methods and tools for high throughput patient screening using the SRM assays.
