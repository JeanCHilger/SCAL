Serum tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and paraoxonase-1 profiles in women with endometriosis, PCOS, or unexplained infertility. To investigate the serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and Paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) during fertility treatment of women with endometriosis (Endo), PCOS or unexplained infertility (Unexpl).Thirty-six patients with Endo, PCOS or Unexpl undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation for IVF or IUI were consented and their serum, on day-3 (baseline) and at the end of FSH treatment (peak), was collected and investigated for levels of TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1, and PON-1. Correlations, ANOVA and Student's t-test were used for statistical analysis.Peak serum levels of IL-6, MCP-1 and PON-1 were positively correlated to E2 peak levels. TNF-α levels were inversely correlated to estradiol levels and they were lower in patients who ultimately became pregnant when compared to non-pregnant (P < 0.05). Mean TNF-α levels were significantly higher in Unexpl group (P < 0.05). The mean levels of IL-6, and MCP-1 were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in women with PCOS compared with Endo and Unexpl. No differences were found between the three clinical groups in patient's age, BMI, Day-3 FSH, PON-1 and pregnancy outcome.Circulating cytokine levels were influenced by ovarian stimulation, as demonstrated by increased levels of IL-6, MCP-1 and PON-1, and decreased level of TNF-α at the end of controlled ovarian stimulation. While evidence of relationship between circulating cytokines with mild endometriosis was not found, PCOS was associated with elevated serum IL-6 and MCP-1 but lower TNF-α concentration. Unexplained infertility was associated with elevated TNF-α level. No relationship between serum PON-1 concentration and PCOS, mild endometriosis or unexplained infertility was noted.
