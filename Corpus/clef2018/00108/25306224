Clinical analysis of transvaginal hydrolaparoscopy in infertile patients. To evaluate the application of transvaginal hydrolaparoscopy for exploration of the pelvic cavity exploration in infertile women.A total of 510 infertile women were included in this study from May 1st, 2009 to April 30, 2012 in the clinic of the Hebei Research Institute for Family Planning.In 495 of 510 of the patients (97.06%), a successful operation was achieved at the first puncture. Of these 495 patients, 286 (57.78%) showed bilateral patency. Completely normal tubo-ovarian and pelvic structures were observed only in 79 patients (15.96%): 16 patients (3.23%) had bilateral tube obstruction, 18 (3.64%) had hydrosalpinx, and 8 (1.62%) had fimbrial stenosis. Pelvic abnormalities occurred in 240 patients (44.04%), including bilateral and/or unilateral tubo-ovarian adhesions in 80 patients (16.16%) and 160 (32.32%) found with adhesions in other parts of the pelvic cavity. Pelvic endometriosis was found in 82 patients (16.57%) and 19 (3.84%) had two or more lesions in the pelvic cavity. In addition, 9 cases (1.82%) of ovarian cysts, 7 (1.41%) of bilateral vesicular appendices and 43 cases (6.69%) of a unilateral vesicular appendix were observed. In addition, convoluted tubes such as bent or twisted tubes were found in 4 cases of bilateral fallopian tube occlusion patients (0.81%) and 17 cases of unilateral tubal occlusion patients (3.43%).Transvaginal hydrolaparoscopy is a feasible, safe, and cost-effective microinvasive technique. This technique can be considered as an alternative procedure for evaluating female infertility.
