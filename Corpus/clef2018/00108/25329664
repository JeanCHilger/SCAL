Integrated microRNA and mRNA transcriptome sequencing reveals the potential roles of miRNAs in stage I endometrioid endometrial carcinoma. Endometrioid endometrial carcinoma (EEC) is the most dominant subtype of endometrial cancer. Aberrant transcriptional regulation has been implicated in EEC. Herein, we characterized mRNA and miRNA transcriptomes by RNA sequencing in EEC to investigate potential molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis. Total mRNA and small RNA were simultaneously sequenced by next generation sequencing technology for 3 pairs of stage I EEC and adjacent non-tumorous tissues. On average, 52,716,765 pair-end 100 bp mRNA reads and 1,669,602 single-end 50 bp miRNA reads were generated. Further analysis indicated that 7 miRNAs and 320 corresponding target genes were differentially expressed in the three stage I EEC patients. Six of all the seven differentially expressed miRNAs were targeting on eleven differentially expressed genes in the cell cycle pathway. Real-time quantitative PCR in sequencing samples and other independent 21 pairs of samples validated the miRNA-mRNA differential co-expression, which were involved in cell cycle pathway, in the stage I EEC. Thus, we confirmed the involvement of hsa-let-7c-5p and hsa-miR-99a-3p in EEC and firstly found dysregulation of hsa-miR-196a-5p, hsa-miR-328-3p, hsa-miR-337-3p, and hsa-miR-181c-3p in EEC. Moreover, synergistic regulations among these miRNAs were detected. Transcript sequence variants such as single nucleotide variant (SNV) and short insertions and deletions (Indels) were also characterized. Our results provide insights on dysregulated miRNA-mRNA co-expression and valuable resources on transcript variation in stage I EEC, which implies the new molecular mechanisms that underlying pathogenesis of stage I EEC and supplies opportunity for further in depth investigations.
