L-22 enhances the invasiveness of endometrial stromal cells of adenomyosis in an autocrine manner. It has reported that interleukin-22 (IL-22) promotes the invasion of tumor cells. IL-22 in the endometriotic milieu stimulates the proliferation of human endometrial stromal cells (ESCs). The present study aimed to elucidate whether and how IL-22 regulates the invasion of ESCs from adenomyosis. The expression of IL-22 and its receptors in normal endometrium, eutopic endometrium and ectopic lesion was analyzed by immunohistochemistry the invasiveness of ESCs in vitro was verified by Matrigel invasion assay
