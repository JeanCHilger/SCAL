Pathological characteristics and prognosis of 664 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer: a retrospective analysis. To analyze clinicopathologic features and risk factors associated with the recurrence and prognosis of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).710 EOC patients treated at the West China University Second Hospital from Jan. 2006 to Jun. 2011 were recruited in this study retrospectively. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were constructed to evaluate the risk of factors. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank methods were adopted for survival analyses.The final sample included 664 patients with complete and well-documented data. The participants had a mean age of (49.35 +/- 11.58) yr. and 79.07% (525/664) were older than 40 year-old. CA125 was tested in 550 patients before surgery and 82.55% showed abnormal values. Over half (55.57%) of the patients were classified as serious EOC, which was followed by clear cell EOC (12.35%), endometrioid EOC (10. 09%), mucinous EOC (7.68%), and others (14.31%). Stage I (FIGO) comprised 30. 72% of the cases. The patients were followed up on average of (37.48 +/- 12.51) months and 303 died with a mean survival length of (28.54 +/- 9.56) months. Recurrence was found in 126 patients at a median of (26.10 +/- 5.75) months. For the 361 survived, 81. 72% lived without detectable cancer. All patients received surgical operations, including 483 undergoing retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy. The univariate analysis identified older age, advanced FIGO stage, suboptimal debulking, abnormal CA125 values before surgery, undifferentiated, mixed type and serous pathologic subtypes, poor-differentiation and pathogenesis of tumor as risk factors associated with survival prospect. The multivariate logistic regression models confirmed that poor prognosis was associated with older age, advanced FIGO stage, suboptimal debulking and undifferentiated, mixed type and serous pathologic subtype.Older age, advanced FIGO stage, high grade differentiation, suboptimal debulking, lymphnode metastasis, and type II EOC are associated with poor prognosis of EOC patients.
