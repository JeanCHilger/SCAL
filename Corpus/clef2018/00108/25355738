Endometriosis: a rare and interesting cause of recurrent haemorrhagic ascites. Recurrent haemorrhagic ascites as a cause of endometriosis is rare. We report the case of a 36-year-old woman presenting acutely with abdominal distension, ascites and an elevated CA-125 raising the suspicion of ovarian malignancy. Tissue biopsies retrieved during laparoscopy confirmed the diagnosis of endometriosis associated with haemorrhagic ascites. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues were started to manage symptoms, with good effect. Subsequently, in vitro fertilisation resulted in a successful singleton pregnancy and by the second trimester, there was full resolution in symptoms. During the early puerperal period, the development of massive ascites recurred, requiring symptomatic relief through repeated ascitic drainage and GnRH analogues. Long-term follow-up is planned with the hope of continuing with medical management at least until the patient's family is complete when the surgical option of bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy will be discussed.
