Immunohistochemical characterization of endometrial carcinomas: endometrioid, serous and clear cell adenocarcinomas in association with genetic analysis. Developments in immunohistochemistry, which are closely linked with the advances in the analyses of genetic abnormalities and their associated molecular disorders as early and late histogenetic events, have contributed greatly to the improvement of pathological diagnostic confirmation and validation. Immunohistochemistry has also generated great benefit to the innovation of therapeutic strategies for various kinds of cancers. In this article, the three representative histological types of corpus cancer, namely, endometrioid adenocarcinoma, serous adenocarcinoma and clear cell adenocarcinoma, will be histologically approached in association with their immunohistochemical profiles as well as genetic disorders. First, the focus will be on 'Conventional/prototypic features,' followed by 'Controversy over conventional histological subclassification,' and subsequently 'Tumorigenesis and re-subclassification'.
