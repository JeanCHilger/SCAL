Coexistence of homologous-type cervical carcinosarcoma with endometrioid-type G1 endometrial cancer: a case report with an immunohistochemical study. Coexistence of two or even more independent primary tumors derived from the female genital tract organs is a unique event. The most common combination is the coexistence of synchronous tumors in the ovary and endometrium. In the present case study, we described a coincidence of homologous-type cervical carcinosarcoma (CS) with endometrioid-type G1 uterine adenocarcinoma (EC) arising on the basis of hyperplastic endometrium. A panel of immunohistochemical markers was applied, either in both CS components or in endometrioid-type EC, to assess possible differences between both uterine malignancies. We also presented a short overview of the coexistence of cervical carcinosarcomas with other female genital tract malignancies.
