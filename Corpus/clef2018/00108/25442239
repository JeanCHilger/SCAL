Ovarian reserve markers and assisted reproductive technique (ART) outcomes in women with advanced endometriosis. The role of ovarian reserve markers as predictors of the controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) response in intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles in women with endometriosis has been much debated. The aim of the present study is to assess the predictability of ovarian reserve markers for the number of mature oocytes (MII) retrieved and to assess the pregnancy rate and live birth rate in women with advanced endometriosis.Two hundred eighty-five infertile women who had laparoscopy followed by a first ICSI cycle were recruited in this prospective study. One hundred ten patients were diagnosed with endometriosis stage III-IV (group 1), and 175 patients had no endometriosis (group II). Sixty-three patients in group 1 had no history of previous endometrioma surgery (group Ia), and 47 patients had a history of previous endometrioma surgery (group Ib).The number of mature oocytes retrieved was significantly lower in women with advanced endometriosis than in women with no endometriosis. The number of mature oocytes retrieved in women with and without endometriosis was best predicted by antral follicle count (AFC) and age, whereas only AFC was a predictor in women with previous endometrioma surgery (odds ratio: 0.49 95% confidence interval: 0.13-0.60). Women with endometriosis had a lower rate of live births than the control group, but this difference was not statistically significantThe best predictor of the COS response in ICSI was AFC, followed by age. Women receiving ICSI following surgery for ovarian endometrioma had a poorer clinical outcome and lower rate of live births compared with those with endometriosis but no previous surgery and the control group.
