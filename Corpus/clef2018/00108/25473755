Heart and Neural Crest Derivatives Expressed Transcript 2 (HAND2): a novel biomarker for the identification of atypical hyperplasia and Type I endometrial carcinoma. Progesterone inhibits the proliferative growth effects of estrogen in the endometrium and prevents the development of endometrial hyperplasia and Type I adenocarcinoma. The exact mechanism of this action is unknown. The progesterone-induced helix-loop-helix transcription factor Heart and Neural Crest Derivatives Expressed 2 (Hand2) was recently shown to suppress production of growth factors in the endometrium. In Hand2 knockout mice, continuous proliferation of the endometrium was observed. In this study, archival paraffin-embedded tissue from 56 hysterectomy specimens was examined by immunohistochemistry for the expression and localization of Hand2, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and Ki-67. Diagnoses included disordered proliferative endometrium, simple and complex hyperplasia with or without atypia, and endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Hand2 expression is localized to endometrial stromal nuclei. In benign endometrium, Hand2 expression was moderate to strong (10/11 91%), with weak Hand2 expression in only 1 case (1/11
