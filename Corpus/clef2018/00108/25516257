Early pregnancy IGF-I and placental GH and risk of epithelial ovarian cancer: A nested case-control study. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) signaling may promote ovarian tumor development by exerting mitotic, antiapoptotic and proangiogenic effects. During pregnancy, maternal production of IGF-I is regulated by placental growth hormone (GH). Parity is an established protective factor for ovarian cancer, however, no prior study has evaluated placental GH and IGF-I in pregnancy and epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Prior prospective studies on the association between IGF-I and EOC in nonpregnant populations were inconclusive and did not address associations in subtypes of EOC. Among members of the Finnish Maternity Cohort and the Northern Sweden Maternity Cohort, we identified 1,045 EOC cases, diagnosed after recruitment (1975-2008) and before March 2011 and 2,658 individually matched controls. Placental GH and IGF-I were measured in serum from the last pregnancy before EOC diagnosis or selection as control. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for tertiles and a doubling of hormone concentrations. Higher IGF-I was associated with a nonsignificant decrease in risk for invasive [ORT3 vs. T1 : 0.79 (0.62-1.02) ptrend  = 0.07] and endometrioid tumors [ORT3 vs. T1 : 0.55 (0.28-1.07)
