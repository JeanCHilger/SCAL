Tissue-specific somatic stem-cell isolation and characterization from human endometriosis. Key roles in the initiation of endometrial proliferative disorders. The endometrial-proliferation related diseases leads to endometrial hyperplasia, i.e., endometriosis. Endometrial progenitor and stem cells play key roles in the beginning of endometrial proliferative disorders. The purpose of this study was the isolation of stem cells in the endometriosis lesion as well as the evaluation and comparison of the stemness-related target genes in endometriosis endometrial stem cells (EESCs), normal endometrial stem cell (ESCs), endometrial lesions stem cell (ELSCs) and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).EESCs, ESCs, ELSCs and MSCs were isolated. Flowcytometry and real-time PCR were utilized to detect the cell surface marker and expression pattern of 16 stemness genes. The proliferation of all stem cells was observed by MTT assay. The differentiation potential was evaluated by alizarin red, oil red O and RT-PCR method. The karyotyping was performed on EESCs and ELSCs at passage 20.The unique patterns of gene expression were detected although EESCs, ESCs, ELSCs and MSCs have a background expression of stemness-related genes. Spindle-like morphology, normal karyotype, adipogenic and osteogenic potential, significantly expression of Oct4, SALL4, DPPA2, Sox2, Sox17 and also specific surface markers such as CD44, CD105, CD90, CD73 and CD146 in EESCs and ELSCs was observed.According to our data, stem cells in endometriosis endometrial and endometriosis are such a informative tools to study of pathogenesis of gynecological diseases. Furthermore, endometrial stem/progenitor cells which easily obtain from tissue may be valuable targets for early diagnosis of endometrial disorders in the future.
