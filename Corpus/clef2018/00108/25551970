Relation of red cell distribution width to the presence and severity of endometriosis. Although the exact pathogenesis of endometriosis is not known, it is proposed to be a chronic inflammatory disease. The asso- ciation between red cell distribution width (RDW) and inflammation is well established. Therefore, in the present study, the authors aimed to investigate the association between presence and severity of endometriosis and RDW.Fifty endometriosis patients and 48 controls were included in the study. The endometriosis group was categorized in two subgroups as mild-to-moderate (n = 35) and moderate-to-severe disease (n = 15). CA-125 and RDW values of all participants were measured.Both RDW (17.7 ± 2.2 vs 14.9 ± 1.5, p < 0.001) and CA-125 (50.6 ± 35.1 vs 27.9 ± 4.8) levels were significantly higher in the endometriosis patients when compared to the control group. Moreover the authors found a significant positive correlation between RDW and CA-125 levels (r: 0.495, p < 0.001).The present study results demonstrated that RDW levels were significantly increased in endometrio- sis patients and associated with the severity of endometriosis.
