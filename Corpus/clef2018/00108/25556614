The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in ovarian cancer: therapeutic opportunities and challenges. The phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) pathway is frequently altered in cancer, including ovarian cancer (OC). Unfortunately, despite a sound biological rationale and encouraging activity in preclinical models, trials of first-generation inhibitors of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in OC have demonstrated negative results. The lack of patient selection as well as resistance to selective mTOR complex-1 (mTORC1) inhibitors could explain the disappointing results thus far. Nonetheless, a number of novel agents are being investigated, including dual mTORC1/mTORC2, Akt, and PI3K inhibitors. Although it is likely that inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway may have little effect in unselected OC patients, certain histological types, such as clear cell or endometrioid OC with frequent phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) and/or phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) alterations, may be particularly suited to this approach. Given the complexity and redundancy of the PI3K signaling network, PI3K pathway inhibition may be most useful in combination with either chemotherapy or other targeted therapies, such as MEK inhibitors, anti-angiogenic therapy, and hormonal therapy, in appropriately selected OC patients. Here, we discuss the relevance of the PI3K pathway in OC and provide an up-to-date review of clinical trials of novel PI3K inhibitors alone or in combination with cytotoxics and novel therapies in OC. In addition, the challenges of drug resistance and predictive biomarkers are addressed.
