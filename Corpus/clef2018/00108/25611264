Prognostic biomarkers in endometrial adenocarcinoma. Endometrial carcinoma is the most common malignancy in the female genital system and has increased in incidence during the past years. Our study was retrospective and included 79 patients with diagnosed endometrial adenocarcinoma. The parameters investigated in the study included clinical status, menopause, history of estrogen intake, obesity, histological results, transvaginal ultrasonography. We evaluated the status of the common clinicopathological features and immunohistochemical biomarkers of endometrial carcinoma. The main type of carcinoma was endometrial endometrioid carcinoma (68 cases), followed by serous carcinoma (seven cases). Immunohistochemical study performed included the following antibodies: cytokeratin, vimentin, ER, PR, PTEN, p53, Î²-catenin, bcl-2, WT1 and Ki67. The immunohistochemical profile showed significant differences between the two subtypes. The majority of cases showed positivity for steroid hormones and the positivity correlated with the endometrioid subtype. We observed a correlation between p53 overexpression and specific histological alterations. A high percentage of Ki67 positivity tumors correlated with grade 3 tumors, as well as with a high percentage of p53 positivity. The study shows the importance of the use of biomarkers in the positive diagnosis and the guiding of therapeutic approach.
