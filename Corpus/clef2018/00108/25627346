Establishment and characterization of a cell line designated Nur-1 derived from human endometrioid adenocarcinoma of uterine corps. A new cell line designated Nur-1 has been established from human endometrioid adenocarcinoma, Grade 1, pT1a, PN1 (3/24), Stage IIIc (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics/Union for International Cancer Control (FIGO/UICC TNM Classification of Malignant Tumours, 7th ed.). Cytological findings of Nur-1 cells reveal anaplastic and pleomorphic features such as anisonucleosis, nucleolar pleomorphism, and piling-up tendency in cellular arrangement. Distribution of the chromosome number is found at the hyperploid range, and the apparent marker chromosome has not been identified. The original tumor and graft of the Nur-1 cell line had a large amount of estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors, as revealed by immunohistochemistry. The cytokeratin pattern of the tumor was positive for cytokeratin-7 and negative for cytokeratin-20. However, a few cells were positive for cytokeratin-20 in the original tumor. Nur-1 cells express mRNA of estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors, cytokeratin-7, and cytokeratin-20 at 105 passages. These findings are consistent with the cytokeratin pattern of endometrial glandular cells. The cells make contact with each other via interdigitation and desmosomes. They possess bundles of microtubules and tonofilaments and many free ribosomes. Some cells have various sizes of phagosomes. The Nur-1 cell line exceeded 102 passages in 5 years, and multiplication of the cells is stable. The modal number of the Nur-1 cell line is 91-92 (56 %). The Nur-1 cells develop well-differentiated adenocarcinoma in tumors sustained in nude mice that resemble the original tumors.
