Macrophage-derived chemokine CCL22 and regulatory T cells in ovarian cancer patients. The study was undertaken to evaluate macrophage-derived chemokine (CCL22) levels in the peritoneal fluid (PF) and plasma of patients with ovarian cancer (n = 93) in relation to regulatory T cells (Tregs n = 75). The peritoneal fluid CCL22 concentrations were significantly higher in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients than in patients with benign tumors-serous cystadenoma (n = 32). There was no difference in plasma levels of CCL22 in EOC patients compared with the non-cancer and healthy volunteers (n = 10). There were no significant differences in the plasma and PF CCL22 levels based on tumor grade. However, women with stage IV FIGO (International Federation of Gynecologists and Obstetricians) had significantly higher plasma CCL22 levels than patients with stages I and III. Women with stage I FIGO had significantly higher PF CCL22 levels than patients with stages II and III. Women with endometrioid cystadenocarcinoma had higher PF CCL22 levels than women with undifferentiated carcinoma. The percentage of tumor-infiltrating Tregs (11.06 %) was significantly higher compared to PF (3.05 %) and peripheral blood (PB) (2.01 %). Moreover, the percentage of Tregs was higher in the PF than in the PB of EOC patients. There were no significant differences in the PB, PF, and tumor-infiltrating Tregs percentage based on tumor stage, grade, or histology. Elevated levels of CCL22 found in the ascites could create a chemokine gradient aiding in Treg cells migration. Increased Tregs percentage in the local microenvironment of ovarian cancer might be an important mechanism of immunosuppression.
