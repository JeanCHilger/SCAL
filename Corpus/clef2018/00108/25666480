Expression of p27 and Jun activation domain-binding protein 1 in endometriosis. The goal of this study was to investigate differential expression of the cell cycle signaling proteins p27 and Jun activation domain-binding protein 1 (Jab1) in benign ovarian cysts of patients with endometriosis compared to controls.Ovarian tissues of 26 endometriosis and 28 non-endometriosis patients were used to evaluate expression of p27 and Jab1 by immunohistochemistry.There are no differences in clinical characteristics between the endometriosis and non-endometriosis group. In the endometriosis group, CD10, Jab1 and p27 were positive in 50, 48.3 and 57.7 % of cases, respectively, compared to 14.3, 17.9 and 50 %, respectively, in the non-endometriosis group. Jab1 and p27 were positive in 69.2 and 84.6 %, respectively, of the definite endometriosis cases.These results demonstrate that Jab1 expression was increased in endometriosis, while p27 expression was similar in the endometriosis and non-endometriosis groups.
