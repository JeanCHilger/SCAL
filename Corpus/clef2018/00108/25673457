Identification of biomarkers for endometriosis using clinical proteomics. We investigated possible biomarkers for endometriosis (EM) using the ClinProt technique and proteomics methods.We enrolled 50 patients with EM, 34 with benign ovarian neoplasms and 40 healthy volunteers in this study. Serum proteomic spectra were generated by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MS) combined with weak cationic exchange (WCX) magnetic beads. Possible biomarkers were analyzed by a random and repeat pattern model-validation method that we designed, and ClinProtools software, results were refined using online liquid chromatography-tandem MS.We found a cluster of 5 peptides (4210, 5264, 2660, 5635, and 5904 Da), using 3 peptides (4210, 5904, 2660 Da) to discriminate EM patients from healthy volunteers, with 96.67% sensitivity and 100% specificity. We selected 4210 and 5904 m/z, which differed most between patients with EM and controls, and identified them as fragments of ATP1B4, and the fibrinogen alpha (FGA) isoform 1/2 of the FGA chain precursor, respectively.ClinProt can identify EM biomarkers, which - most notably - distinguish even early-stage or minimal disease. We found 5 stable peaks at 4210, 5264, 2660, 5635, and 5904 Da as potential EM biomarkers, the strongest of which were associated with ATP1B4 (4210 Da) and FGA (5904 Da) this indicates that ATP1B4 and FGA are associated with EM pathogenesis.
