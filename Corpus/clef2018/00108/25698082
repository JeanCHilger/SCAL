Activated mutant p110Î± causes endometrial carcinoma in the setting of biallelic Pten deletion. PTEN and PIK3CA mutations occur with high frequency in uterine endometrioid carcinoma (UEC). Although PTEN mutations are present in complex atypical hyperplasia and carcinoma, PIK3CA mutations are restricted to carcinoma. We generated mouse models harboring Pten loss and/or activated Pik3ca in the endometrial epithelium to investigate their respective roles in the pathogenesis of UEC. Presence of an activated mutant Pik3ca on the background of Pten loss led to aggressive disease, with 100% of mice exhibiting carcinoma. Expression of Pik3ca with E545K mutation alone was unable to cause hyperplasia or cancer in the uterus and did not activate Akt as effectively as Pten deletion in short-term cultures of mouse endometrial epithelium, likely explaining the lack of phenotype in vivo. We also report that nuclear localization of FOXO1 correlated with PTEN mutational status irrespective of the PIK3CA status in endometrial cancer cell lines. Furthermore, gene expression profiles resulting from Pten loss or activation of Pik3ca in primary mouse endometrial epithelial cells exhibit minimal overlap. Thus, Pten and Pik3ca have distinct consequences on the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway in endometrial epithelium and are likely to affect other nonoverlapping cellular mechanisms involved in the development and progression of the most common type of uterine cancer.
