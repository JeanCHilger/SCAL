Phytochemical analyses and effects of Alchemilla mollis (Buser) Rothm. and Alchemilla persica Rothm. in rat endometriosis model. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the treatment potential of Alchemilla mollis (Buser) Rothm. and Alchemilla persica Rothm. in the experimentally induced endometriosis model in rats.Endometriosis was surgically induced in rats by autotransplanting endometrial tissue to abdominal wall. Thirty-six rats were randomly divided into six groups. The groups were orally treated with the methanol:water (80:20) extracts of aerial parts and roots of A. mollis and A. persica. Buserelin acetate (20 mg) was used as the reference drug. The phytochemical contents of the most active extracts were determined by high performance liquid chromatography.The cystic formation was determined to be significantly decreased with the aerial part extract of A. mollis. A reduction in the endometrioma was also determined for the aerial part extract of A. persica group. However, significant reduction on the levels of cytokine were recorded for the A. mollis aerial part extract group. Therefore, the phytochemical contents of the aerial part extracts of A. mollis. and A. persica were analyzed.The results of the present study revealed that the aerial part extracts of A. mollis and A. persica could be beneficial in the treatment of endometriosis.
