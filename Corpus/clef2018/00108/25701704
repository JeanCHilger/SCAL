PIKing the type and pattern of PI3K pathway mutations in endometrioid endometrial carcinomas. The vast majority of endometrioid endometrial carcinomas (EECs) harbor mutations in the PI3K pathway. Here we sought to determine whether the type and pattern of mutations targeting different components of the PI3K pathway are distinct between microsatellite stable (MSS) and high-level microsatellite instable (MSI-H) EECs.Whole exome massively parallel sequencing-based mutation data from EECs of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were used to define the number, type and pattern of mutations affecting PI3K pathway-related genes, including AKT1, INPP4B, MTOR, PIK3CA, PIK3R1 and PTEN. EECs were classified as MSI-H (n=70) and MSS (n=109) based on seven MSI markers assessed by TCGA. Ultramutated cases were excluded.Although the mutation rates and mutational signatures of MSS and MSI-H EECs were distinct, the prevalence of PI3K pathway mutations was similar between these two groups (all p>0.05), with the exception of PTEN mutations, which were more prevalent in MSI-H (61/70 87%) than in MSS EECs (78/109Although the prevalence of mutations targeting PI3K pathway genes is similar between MSS and MSI-H EECs, PIK3CA hotspot mutations, which result in constitutive kinase activation, are significantly more prevalent in MSS than in MSI-H EECs. Our findings warrant further investigation of the role of different types of PIK3CA mutations and their predictive impact on distinct subtypes of EECs.
