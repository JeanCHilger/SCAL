Addition of MCP-1 and MIP-3β to the IL-8 appraisal in peritoneal fluid enhances the probability of identifying women with endometriosis. Chemokines have been associated with endometriosis. Our study was aimed at evaluating the levels of six chemokines--CXCL8 (IL-8), CXCL12 (SDF-1), CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL5 (RANTES), CCL19 (MIP-3β), and CCL21 (6-Ckine)--in the peritoneal fluid (PF) of patients with and controls without endometriosis by multiplexed cytokine assay. In this retrospective case-control study conducted at the Charité University Hospital, patients (n = 36) and controls (n = 27) were enrolled. The patients were separated into groups according to stage of the disease: I-II (n = 21), III-IV (n = 1 5), and according to clinical findings: peritoneal endometriosis (PE n = 7), deep-infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) affecting the retrocervical area (n = 13) or the bowel/rectovaginal site (n = 14). The subjects were also separated according to the cycle phase: follicular (n = 14) or luteal (n = 8) and the previous use (n = 25) or not (n = 38) of hormones. PF was collected from all subjects (n = 63) consecutively during laparoscopy. The concentration of chemokines in the PF was assessed using Luminex(®) x-MAP(®) technology. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated. A model of multiple logistic regressions estimated the odds of endometriosis for each combination of the chemokines detected. We observed significantly higher concentrations of IL-8 (p < 0.001), MCP-1 (p = 0.014), and MIP-3β (p = 0.022) in the PF of women with endometriosis than in the controls. A joint evaluation revealed that elevated levels of the three chemokines had a positive endometriosis prediction value of 89.1%. The combined assessment of MCP-1, MIP-3β, and IL-8 concentration in PF improved the likelihood of identifying patients with endometriosis. Future studies should investigate this panel in peripheral blood samples.
