Diagnostic potential of peritoneal fluid biomarkers of endometriosis. Endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterus, in different parts of the peritoneal cavity. It affects up to 10% of reproductive-age women and up to 50% of women with infertility. Surgical diagnosis of endometriosis is still the gold standard, with no diagnostic biomarkers available. Medical therapies target the symptoms and not the disease itself, and surgical treatment cannot prevent recurrence. As peritoneal fluid reflects the altered peritoneal microenvironment of endometriosis patients, it can provide a wealth of information on pathophysiological processes and potential biomarkers. This report reviews the molecular biomarkers identified in peritoneal fluid over the last 5 years and discusses their potential applications for diagnosis, prognosis and drug therapy.
