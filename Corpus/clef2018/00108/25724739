G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 agonist G-1 induces cell cycle arrest in the mitotic phase, leading to apoptosis in endometriosis. To demonstrate the effects of the selective G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER) agonist G-1 in human ovarian endometriotic stromal cells (ESCs).Experimental inÂ vitro study.University hospital.A total of 33 patients with ovarian endometrioma.Endometriotic stromal cells from ovarian chocolate cysts were treated with the GPER agonist G-1.The primary outcomes were cell proliferation, measured using the WST-8 assay cell cycle, as analyzed using flow cytometry, fluorescent immunocytochemistry, and cytotoxicityG-1 suppressed ESC proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect was not blocked when GPER signaling pathways, including the GPER itself, were inhibited. G-1 induced cell cycle arrest and accumulation in the sub-G1 phase in ESCs. Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that G-1 interrupted microtubule assembly at the mitotic phase. G-1 also induced caspase-3-dependent apoptosis without significant cytotoxicity.G-1 suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis in ESCs, suggesting the potential use of this compound as a therapeutic drug for the treatment of endometriosis.
