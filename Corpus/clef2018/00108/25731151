Prognostic value of preoperative Ca125 and Tag72 serum levels and their correlation to disease relapse and survival in endometrial cancer. To evaluate preoperative serum levels of Ca125 and Tag72-4 tumour markers and investigate if abnormal levels correlate to mortality and disease-free survival.Retrospective observational study of a cohort of 282 women (mean age 62.3, SD 10.5 years) with primary endometrial cancer included all consecutive cases treated in a tertiary Gynaecological oncology Center. Excluded cases with other cancer or previous cancer treatment, major abdominal pathology or inflammation, endometriosis. Preoperative serum Tag72 and Ca125 levels were determined and evaluated in relation to disease-free survival (DFS) and disease-specific overall survival (DOS).Raised Ca125 correlates to worse overall disease-specific survival (66.1 vs 87.8 months, p = 0.021) and Tag72 correlates to shorter disease-free survival (69.2 vs 67.3 months, p = 0.021) and higher recurrence rate (13.5 vs 6 %, p = 0.021). When both Ca125 and Tag72 are abnormal DFS and DOS are worse. 93.3 % (72.3 months) vs 82.4 %, (61.3 months) p = 0.018 and 96.3 % (74.8 months) vs 88.2 %, (65.9 months) p = 0.021, respectively.This study enhances the value of preoperative tumour markers and their prognostic value. Ca125 and Tag72 appear to be good predictors of poor prognosis in patients with endometrial cancer.
