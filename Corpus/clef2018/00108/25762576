A case of endometriosis presenting as an inguinal hernia. Endometriosis is a common clinical presentation for gynaecologists. Occasionally it can present to general surgeons as a swelling in the groin or abdominal wall. This condition should be included in the differential diagnosis in female patients. A 32-year-old woman with a 2-year history of a painful persistent lump in her right groin was referred to the general surgeons by her general practitioner. She was referred with a diagnosis of a suspected inguinal hernia. MRI excluded a hernia and exploration of the groin and subsequent histology confirmed the lesion to be an endometrial deposit.
