Cytological scoring and prognosis of poorly differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Histopathological variation has been demonstrated in grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinomas. We attempted to evaluate the clinicopathological features of grade 3 tumors by endometrial cytological features using a scoring system.Twenty-one endometrial cytological samples were evaluated using 5 cytological features: rates of cluster formation in tumor cells nuclear pleomorphismThe median cytological score was 6 (range 4-14) therefore, samples with scores of 4-5 were defined as having low scores, while those with scores of 6-14 were defined as high scores. The accuracy of the cytological diagnosis for grade 3 tumors in the high score group (8/10 patients, 80.0%) was significantly higher than that of the low score group (2/11 patients, 18.2%Grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinomas varied in cytological features according to the scoring system used, high scores were associated with worse clinicopathological factors and poorer prognosis than low scores.
