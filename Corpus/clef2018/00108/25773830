Evaluation of hemoglobin A1c levels in endometrial cancer patients: a retrospective study in Turkey. Hemoglobin A1c(HgA1c) is a marker of poor gylcemic control and elevation HgA1c is associated with increased risk of many cancers. We aimed to determine the HgA1c levels in endometrial cancer cases and any relationship with stage and grade of disease.A retrospective data review was performed between June 2011 and October 2012 at a tertiary referral center in Turkey. The study included 35 surgically staged endometrial cancer patients and 40 healthy controls. Preoperative HgA1c levels drawn within 3 months before surgery were compared. Also the relationships between HgA1c levels and stage, grade and hystologic type of cancer cases were evaluated.The mean HgA1c levels were statistically significantly higher at 6.19 ± 1.44 in endometrial cancer cases than the 5.61 ± 0.58 in controls (p=0.027). With endometrial cancer cases, the mean HgA1c level was found to be 6.62 ± 1.40 for stage I and 6.88 ± 1.15 for stages II-IV (p=0.07). The figures were 6.74 ± 1.65 for endometrioid and 6.63 ± 1.41 for non-endometrioid type tumors (p=0.56). Mean HgA1c levels of 6.72 ± 1.14 for grade 1 and 6.62 ± 1.42 for grade 2-3 were observed (p=0.57).HgA1c levels in endometrial cancer patients were statistically higher than healthy controls. However, HgA1c did not show any significant correlation with stage, grade and histologic type in endometrial cancer cases.
