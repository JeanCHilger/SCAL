Evaluation of serum L-FABP levels in patients with acute pancreatitis. The aim of this study was to assess the serum L-FABP levels in patients with acute pancreatitis and compare with healthy subjects.Thirty patients with acute pancreatitis and thirty consecutive healthy age- and sex-matched control subjects were included into the study. The serum levels of L-FABP were measured upon admission and at the remission period.Upon admission, serum L-FABP concentration was significantly higher in patients with acute pancreatitis compared to control subjects (41009.41 ± 32401.31 pg/ml vs. 17057.00 ± 5015.74 pg/ml, p=0.008). Serum L-FABP levels decreased after the remission period however, the differences were not statistically significant. In addition, serum L-FABP levels showed significant correlation with AST and LDH levels.Increased serum L-FABP levels may be related to the mechanism of pancreatic microcirculatory disturbance in patients with acute pancreatitis, suggesting that serum L-FABP could be used for a potential biomarker of acute pancreatitis.
