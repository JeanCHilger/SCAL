Serum HE4 is more suitable as a biomarker than CA125 in Chinese women with benign gynecologic disorders. This study measured the human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) and CA125 levels in Chinese women with benign gynecological disorders.Sera were obtained from Chinese women prior to surgery for a pelvic mass and HE4 and CA125 levels were determined. The proportions of patients with HE4 and CA125 levels were compared.There were 68 Chinese women with benign diseases. HE4 levels were less elevated than CA125 (1% V.S. 29%, P<0.001). The significant difference was observed in patients with endometriosis/endometriomas in which HE4 was not elevated patients and CA125 was elevated in 53% (P<0.001). Serum HE4 level was not elevated in patients with cystadenoma (0% V.S. 23%, P<0.001) and in patients with germ cell tumors (0% V.S. 5%, P<0.001).HE4 was less elevated and more suitable as a biomarker than CA125 in chinese women with benign disease.
