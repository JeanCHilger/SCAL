Selective inhibition of prostaglandin E2 receptors EP2 and EP4 modulates DNA methylation and histone modification machinery proteins in human endometriotic cells. Endometriosis is an inflammatory gynecological disease of reproductive-age women. The prevalence of endometriosis is 5-10% in reproductive-age women. Modern medical treatments are directed to inhibit the action of estrogen in endometriotic cells. However, hormonal therapies targeting estrogen can be prescribed only for a short time because of their undesirable side effects. Recent studies from our laboratory, using human endometriotic epithelial cell line 12Z and stromal cell line 22B derived from red lesion, discovered that selective inhibition of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) receptors EP2 and EP4 inhibits adhesion, invasion, growth, and survival of 12Z and 22B cells by modulating integrins, MMPs and TIMPs, cell cycle, survival, and intrinsic apoptotic pathways, suggesting multiple epigenetic mechanisms. The novel findings of the present study indicate that selective pharmacological inhibition of EP2 and EP4: (i) decreases expression of DNMT3a, DNMT3b, H3K9me3, H3K27me3, SUV39H1, HP1a, H3K27, EZH2, JMJD2a, HDAC1, HDAC3, MeCP2, CoREST and Sin3A (ii) increases expression of H3K4me3, H3H9ac, H3K27ac
