Expression of HNF-1β in cervical carcinomas: an immunohistochemical study of 155 cases. HNF-1β is a commonly used marker in the differential diagnosis of clear cell carcinoma of the ovary and endometrium. Recent studies have found HNF-1β expression to a lesser extent in other ovarian and endometrial tumors including endometrioid, mucinous and, rarely, serous carcinoma. Regarding cervical carcinoma, HNF-1β expression has been mentioned exceptionally in mesonephric and some other types of adenocarcinoma. However, a systematic analysis of HNF-1β expression in cervical carcinomas has not been performed to date.We analyzed HNF-1β expression in 155 cervical carcinomas (including 56 adenocarcinomas, 85 squamous cell carcinomas and 14 undifferentiated carcinomas). Expression of HNF-1β was correlated with the expression of other markers including estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, CEA, p63, p40, p16, and D2-40.Adenocarcinomas showed expression of HNF-1β in 42/56 cases (75%), CEA in 48/56 cases (85.7%), p63 in 4/56 cases (7.2%), p40 in 2/56 cases (3.6%), estrogen receptors in 9/56 cases (16.1%), progesterone receptors in 5/56 cases (8.9%), p16 in 56/56 (100%) cases, and D2-40 in 0/56 cases (0%). Squamous cell carcinomas showed expression of HNF-1β in 2/85 cases (2.35%), CEA in 77/85 cases (90.6%), p63 and p40 in 85/85 cases (100%), estrogen receptors in 9/85 cases (10.6%), progesterone receptors in 1/85 cases (1.2%), p16 in 84/85 cases (98.8%), and D2-40 in 45/84 cases (53.6%). Undifferentiated carcinomas showed expression of HNF-1β in 2/14 cases (14.3%), CEA in 8/14 cases (57.1%), p16 in 14/14 cases (100%), hormone receptors in 0/13 cases (0%), p63 in 7/14 cases (50%), p40 in 5/14 cases (35.7%), and D2-40 in 1/14 cases (7.1%).In cervical carcinoma, expression of HNF-1β is mostly restricted to adenocarcinomas and can be used as an auxiliary adenocarcinoma marker in the differential diagnosis of poorly differentiated cervical carcinomas. HNF-1β as an adenocarcinoma marker and p63/p40 and D2-40 as a squamous cell carcinoma markers are highly specific with variable sensitivity. Optimal results can be achieved using these markers in a panel.The virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/1348836442160205 .
