MicroRNAs and angiogenesis in endometriosis. miRNAs function as important regulators of a wide range of cellular processes, such as angiogenesis and fibrinolysis, by postranscriptional modulation of gene expression. We present a review on the role of miRNAs and angiogenesis in endometriosis. Endometriosis, defined as the implantation of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity, is one of the most frequent benign gynecological diseases and it has important consequences on the quality of life and fertility of patients. Similarly to tumor metastasis, the ectopic endometrium acquires the capability to adhere, proliferate and infiltrate the extracellular matrix. Endometriosis is a multifactorial and polygenic disease in which angiogenesis and proteolysis may be involved, and emerging data provide evidence that a dysregulation of miRNA expression may be implicated in these processes. The detection of circulating miRNAs in plasma and other body fluids and their relative stability has raised the possibility that they might serve as non-invasive biomarkers for the diagnosis of the disease. On the other hand, the development of therapies that might block the expression or mimic the functions of miRNAs could represent new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of endometriosis.
