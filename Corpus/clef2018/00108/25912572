Diagnostic findings in adenomyosis: a pictorial review on the major concerns. Adenomyosis is a benign pathology with a marked impact on women in reproductive age. The prevalence of adenomyosis ranges from 5 to 70%. Dysmenorrhea, metrorrhagia, chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia and infertility often occur, while a third of the women is asymptomatic. This pictorial review focuses on the peculiar patterns of presentation in adenomyosis. They are identified by means of non-invasive or minimally invasive techniques, with particular reference to 2D- and 3D-transvaginal sonography, sonohysterosalpingography, magnetic resonance imaging, and endoscopic techniques (i.e. hysteroscopy and laparoscopy).
