Analysis of laparoscopy on endometriosis patients with high expression of CA125. To analyze the clinical effect of laparoscopy on patients with endometriosis and a high expression of CA125.One hundred cases of endometriosis treated in our hospital from May 2012 to August 2014 were selected as research subjects, after approval from the hospital and the informed consent of patients. The subjects were randomly divided into a control group and a study group with 50 cases in each group. The control group underwent the traditional surgery, while the research group underwent laparoscopy. The clinical curative effect were compared between the two groups of patients.The research group's postoperative 6h, 12h, 24h CA125 levels were compared to those of the control group. There was statistically significant difference between groups (p < 0.05). Surgery and hospitalization time, intraoperative bleeding volume, and and incision length index of the two groups of patients were compared. There were statistically significant differences between the two groups (p < 0.05).Laparoscopic surgery in endometriosis patients with high expression of CA125 is curative, and the patients'recovery after surgery is promising.
