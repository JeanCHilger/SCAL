Juvenile catamenial pneumothorax: institutional report and review. Catamenial pneumothorax (CP) is a type of spontaneous pneumothorax due to thoracic endometriosis occurring in reproductive women, and usually involves the right side of the thorax showing diaphragm lesions. For the present study, we defined juvenile CP (JCP) as patients with CP who were 19 years old and younger. Institutional findings and a systematic literature review are presented.We retrospectively enrolled all patients with CP treated at our institutions from January 2002 to June 2013. In addition, we conducted a search of medical literature published using the PubMed and Japanese Ichushi databases with "catamenial pneumothorax" as the search term.Thirteen female patients with CP, 1 on the left side, were treated at our institutions. The patient with left-side CP was classified as JCP, while that was also identified in 29 of 451 CPs reported in our literature review. Pneumothorax occurred more frequently on the left side in JCP as compared to usual CP (p<0.01). There was a significantly lower ratio of JCP cases with diaphragm lesions as compared to usual CP (p<0.01).Significant laterality was not seen in JCP patients and fewer had diaphragm lesions as compared to usual CP. JCP may be a new entity of CP.
