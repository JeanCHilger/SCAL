A phase II trial of trebananib (AMG 386 IND#111071), a selective angiopoietin 1/2 neutralizing peptibody, in patients with persistent/recurrent carcinoma of the endometrium: An NRG/Gynecologic Oncology Group trial. Ang1 & 2 (angiopoietin-1 -2) interact with Tie2 receptors on endothelial cells to mediate vascular remodeling in an angiogenesis signaling pathway distinct from the VEGF axis. Trebananib is a peptide Fc fusion protein that binds Ang1 and 2 and prevents interaction with Tie2. The efficacy of trebananib in recurrent/persistent endometrial cancer (EC) was studied.The primary objective was to determine the frequency of patients with objective tumor responses (ORR) and event-free survival for ≥6months (6-month EFS) and determine toxicity of trebananib at a dose and schedule of 15mg/kg, IV QW. Recurrent/persistent EC, measurable disease, and ≤2 prior chemotherapy lines were required.Thirty-two patients were eligible and treated. The most common histologies were G1/2 endometrioid (31%), G3 endometrioid (28%) and serous (31.3%). 78% of patients had 1 prior regimen. Patients received 1-9+ cycles of trebananib 24 patients (75%) received ≤2cycles. One patient had a partial response (3.1%)Trebananib has insufficient single agent activity in recurrent EC to warrant further investigation at this dose/schedule.
