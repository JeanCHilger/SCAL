Small RNAs: Their Possible Roles in Reproductive Failure. Posttranscriptional gene regulation is a regulatory mechanism which occurs "above the genome" and confers different phenotypes and functions within a cell. Transcript and protein abundance above the level of transcription can be regulated via noncoding ribonucleic acid (ncRNA) molecules, which potentially play substantial roles in the regulation of reproductive function. MicroRNA (miRNA), endogenous small interfering RNA (endo-siRNA), and PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) are three primary classes of small ncRNA. Similarities and distinctions between their biogenesis and in the interacting protein machinery that facilitate their function distinguish these three classes. Characterization of the expression and importance of the critical components for the biogenesis of each class in different tissues contributes a clearer understanding of their contributions in specific reproductive tissues and their ability to influence fertility in both males and females. This chapter discusses the expression and potential roles of miRNA, endo-siRNA, and piRNA in the regulation of reproductive function. Additionally, this chapter elaborates on investigations aimed to address and characterize specific mechanisms through which miRNA may influence infertility and the use of miRNA as biomarkers associated with several reproductive calamities such as defective spermatogenesis in males, polycystic ovarian failure, endometriosis and obesity, and chemical-induced subfertility.
