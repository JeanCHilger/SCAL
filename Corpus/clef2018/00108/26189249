c-Met and RON expression levels in endometrial adenocarcinoma tissue and their relationship with prognosis. To investigate the potential relevance of c-Met and RON gene expression in patients with adenocarcinoma of the endometrium and analyze the relationships among the c-Met and RON expression, clinicopathological characteristics, and patient survival.The study included 60 cases diagnosed with endometrial adenocarcinoma with more than five-years follow-up. Total RNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues of 60 adenocarcinomas of the endometrium and normal endometrium tissues were isolated for c-Met and RON quantitative analysis by real-time real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).The c-Met and RON expression in endometrial adenocarcinoma was significantly higher than that in normal endometrial tissues (p < 0.01), with average up-regulated levels of 3.94 ± 1.88 and 2.74 ± 0.88, respectively. Moreover, high c-Met expression was significantly correlated with the histological stage (p = 0.017), and high RON expression was related to histological stage (p = 0.035), muscle invasion (p = 0.006), and lymph node metastasis (p = 0.018). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that the co-expression of c-Met and RON was an independent prognostic factor for adenocarcinoma of the endometrium and was significantly associated with decreased overall survival (HR = 3.571, p = 0.014).The co-expression of c-Met and RON is associated with a poor prognosis in endometrial adenocarcinoma and is an independent prognostic marker for endometrioid adenocarcinoma.
