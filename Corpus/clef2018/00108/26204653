RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PROANGIOGENIC ROLE OF EG-VEGF, CLINICOPATHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND SURVIVAL IN TUMORAL OVARY. To prove the presence of EG-VEGF in tumor ovary and to analyze its involvement in the ovarian carcinogenesis, as promoter of angiogenesis, in relationship with the clinicopathological prognostic factors and survival.The study group comprises tumor tissue specimens from 50 cases of surgically treated ovarian cancer that were immunohistochemically investigated. A scoring system based on the percentage of positive cells and the intensity of staining was applied for the semiquantitative assessment of EG-VEGF, as negative or positive. Statistics involved Ï‡2 test, and Kaplan-Meier and log-rank test.EG-VEGF was positive in 35 cases (70%) and negative in 15 cases (30%). Our data confirmed the predominance of EG-VEGF positivity in the serous subiype as compared to endometrioid and clear cell subtypes, and its absence in mucinous subtype. Moreover, we demonstrated that EG-VEGF is overexpressed mainly in high-grade ovarian carcinomas (type II) than in low-grade ones. Significant differences were registered between the EG-VEGF positive or negative expression and tumor stage and histological subtypes, respectively. Survival analysis showed no differences in patient's survival and EG-VEGF positive and negative cases.The analysis of EG-VEGF expression in ovarian tumors points out the relationship between the enhanced potential for tumor angiogenesis and the tumor aggressivity.
