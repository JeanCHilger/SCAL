Randomized, blind, parallel-controlled and multiple-centre clinical trial on the effectiveness and safety of leuprolide acetate in the treatment of endometriosis. To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of leuprolide acetate in the treatment of endometriosis.From Nov. 2007 to Oct. 2012, the patients who confirmed to be endometriosis were randomly divided into test group of 113 cases and control group of 116 cases. The test drug was the sustained-release agent of leuprolide acetate. The control drug was Enantone. The drugs were used for 3 times in total. After treatment, the ovarian mass volumes measured with type-B ultrasound, the scores of the patient's subjective symptoms during non-menstrual and menstruation days, the pelvic signs during non-menstrual days, the changes of hormones [estradiol (E2), FSH, LH], and adverse events were observed.After the treatment, the rate of changes of ovarian mass volume (among them, at 12 weeks after the first injection, the median was -55.83% in the test group, -68.22% in the control group, P = 0.336), the distinct improvement rate of symptom scores and pelvic signs during non-menstrual days [among them, at 12 weeks after the first injection, the rate of lower abdomen pain was 47.5% (48/101) in the test group, 44.0% (44/100) in the control group, P = 0.881], the hormone (E2, FSH, LH) levels [among them, at 12 weeks after the first injection, the serum level of E2, was (33±38) pmol/L in the test group, (38±40) pmol/L in the control group, P = 0.414 the serum level of FSH, was (5.1±2.8) U/L in the test group, (5.3±2.3) U/L in the control group, P = 0.666Leuprolide acetate is effective and safe in the treatment of endometriosis.
