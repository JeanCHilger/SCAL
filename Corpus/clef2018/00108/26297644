Nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomic profiling of urine provides a noninvasive alternative to the identification of biomarkers associated with endometriosis. To investigate whether urine metabolomic profile can be used to identify biomarkers associated to endometriosis.Prospective study. For each subject, a urine sample was collected after overnight fasting and before surgery.University medical center.The clinical cohort included 45 endometriosis patients, diagnosed at early (n = 6) and advanced (n = 39) stages of the disease, and 36 healthy women. All women underwent diagnostic laparoscopy to visually confirm the presence or absence of endometriotic lesions.Metabolomic profiling of urine samples based on (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in combination with statistical approaches.Comparative identification of metabolites present in urine from endometriosis patients and healthy women.The urine metabolomic profile of endometriosis patients exhibited higher concentrations of N(1)-methyl-4-pyridone-5-carboxamide, guanidinosuccinate, creatinine, taurine, valine, and 2-hydroxyisovalerate and decreased concentrations of lysine compared with healthy women. Most of these metabolites are involved in inflammation and oxidative stress processes. These pathophysiologic events had been previously described to be present in ectopic endometrial proliferation foci.Overall, the results demonstrate the potential of (1)H-NMR-based metabolomics, a rapid and noninvasive approach, to identify metabolic changes associated to endometriosis in urine samples. This information could be useful to get a better understanding of the pathogenesis of endometriosis, thus providing support to the noninvasive diagnosis of this pathology.
