Canadian high risk endometrial cancer (CHREC) consortium: analyzing the clinical behavior of high risk endometrial cancers. The objective of this study is to analyze the clinical behavior of endometrial carcinomas by high risk(HR) histotype, including stage, overall survival, recurrence free survival and patterns of failure.This is a retrospective multi-institutional cohort study performed at 7 tertiary care centers across Canada between 2000 and 2012 and included: grade 3 endometrioid (EC3), endometrial serous cancer (ESC), clear cell carcinomas (CCC) and carcinosarcoma (CS). Clinicopathological and outcome data was collected.1260 women with endometrial carcinoma with 1013 having staging procedures were identified 398 EC3, 449 ESC, 236 CS and 91 CCC. 51.8% had lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) and 18.5% had omental involvement with a statistically significant difference between tumor types (p=0.0005 and 0.0047 respectively)This study is one of the largest clinical cohorts of HR endometrial cancers. We have further clarified the impact of histotype and stage on recurrence and survival, and the high likelihood of distant recurrence. However, the differences are modest and risk prediction models will require additional molecular markers.
