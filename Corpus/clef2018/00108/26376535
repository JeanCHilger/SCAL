Endometriosis and carcinosarcoma--a hypothetical correlation or a proven pathogenetic pathway? Colon carcinosarcoma with origin in endometriotic foci--a case report. We present the first case of a patient with a synchronic occurrence of three neoplasms: non-small cell lung cancer serous cancer of the ovary and carcinosarcoma of the colon. Moreover, the possible origin of the carcinosarcoma is an endometriotic focus, which is an extremely rare occurrence, especially in women with no history of endometriotic treatment. Immunohistochemical staining of the carcinosarcoma was positive for CD10, estrogen receptors and desmin--typical markers for endometriotic foci. The growth of endometriosis depends on estrogen, which is produced at reduced levels after menopause. However, in some cases endometriosis could be diagnosed de novo in postmenopausal women. On the basis of the reported patient we discuss possible correlations between endometriosis and carcinosarcoma, as well as treatment methods of carcinosarcoma.
