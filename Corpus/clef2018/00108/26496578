Preoperative Pelvic MRI and Serum Cancer Antigen-125: Selecting Women With Grade 1 Endometrial Cancer for Lymphadenectomy. The objective of our study was to determine the predictive value of preoperative pelvic MRI and serum cancer antigen-125 (CA-125) evaluation in selecting women with grade 1 endometrial cancer for lymphadenectomy as part of the cancer staging operation.A new preoperative clinical protocol including MRI and CA-125 evaluation was adopted at our institution in patients with grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Lymphadenectomy was considered as part of the surgical staging operation if there was an elevated CA-125 value or a positive MRI finding (≥ 50% myometrial invasion, cervical invasion, abnormal lymph nodes, extrauterine disease, or tumor index ≥ 36 cm). From January 2012 through May 2013, a retrospective analysis was performed of 100 women who underwent preoperative MRI and CA-125 evaluation we refer to this cohort as the "preoperative study cohort." The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated using final surgical pathology and CA-125 results as the reference standard. The rate of metastatic lymph nodes in the preoperative study cohort was determined. From May 2009 through January 2011, a retrospective analysis of a cohort who did not undergo preoperative MRI and CA-125 evaluation was undertaken to compare lymphadenectomy and lymph node metastasis rates before and after implementation of the new protocolThe new clinical protocol had sensitivity of 94%, specificity of 91%, PPV of 84%, and NPV of 97%. When histologic grade alone was considered, positive lymph node rates in the preoperative study cohort was 4.0% versus 4.2% in the historical cohort. In the preoperative study cohort, the lymph node metastasis rate increased to 11.1% with a positive MRI finding or elevated CA-125 value.Preoperative MRI and CA-125 evaluation identified women for lymphadenectomy with a high NPV.
