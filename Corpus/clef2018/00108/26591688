Effect of warming Yang and removing blood stasis method on matrix metalloproteinases / tissue inhibitor metalloproteinases levels secreted by cultured endometrial cells from patients with endometriosis. To investigate the effect of Chinese medicines using the warming Yang and removing blood stasis method on levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)/tissue inhibitor metalloproteinases (TIMPs) secreted by cultured endometrial cells from patients with endometriosis.Ectopic and eutopic endometrial cells obtaind from 15 endometriosis patients were cultured in vitro, and divided randomly into five groups: high dose moderate doseCompared with the normal control group, levels of MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-9 in eutopic and ectopic endometrium cell supernatants in the blank control group were increased, whereas levels of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were decreased (P < 0.05). Compared with the blank control group, levels of MMP-1 and MMP-2 in ectopic and eutopic endometrium cell supernatants cultured in low-dose, middle-dose, and high-dose groups were decreased, whereas levels of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were increased significantly (P < 0.05).The warming Yang and removing blood stasis method affects expression of MMPs and TIMPs.
