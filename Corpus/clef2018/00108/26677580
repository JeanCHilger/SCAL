Inhibin A and B levels in serum and follicular fluids of women with various reproductive failures undergoing in vitro fertilization. Ovarian inhibins (INH) are hormones participating in the regulation of gametogenesis. We monitored inhibin A and B levels in serum (S) and follicular fluids (FF), depending on the type of fertility failure and treatment outcome.We examined INHA and B levels in S and FF of 72 women undergoing ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization, including embryo transfer We took serum samples at the time of egg collection (S1), embryo transfer (S2), and diagnostics of early pregnancy (S3). FF samples were obtained during egg collection. INH A and B levels were measured by ELISA set kit in all media.Healthy women had median of INHA S1 592.02pg/ml INHA S2 593.58pg/ml, INHA S3 15.17pg/ml and INH B S1 242.46pg/ml, INH B S2 and INH B S3 zero levels. Women with ovarian disorders had significantly lower levels of INH A S1 and INH A S2 (p<0.05). Women with polycystic ovaries had significant higher INH B S2 levels (p<0. 05). No statistically significant differences were found in women with endometriosis. Presence of oocyte in the dominant follicle positively correlated with INH B FF levels (p<0.05).WE confirmed differences in the levels of inhibins in sera depending on type of fertility failure. Inhibin B better reflected the presence of an oocyte. The potential paracrine role of inhibins needs to be examined to improve preparation for the in vitro fertilization treatment (IVF).
