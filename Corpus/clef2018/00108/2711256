Differential mortality by sex. Causes and behavior of respiratory and gastroenteric infections in Mexico. The differential in mortality by sex has not been broadly studied in Mexico. In this work mortality by sex in under one year old children and infants by federal entity for the main infectious diseases during 1980-1982 was analyzed. The results showed that the rate of mortality by sex (RMS) for under one year old children was higher than one, which means that there is a male over-mortality for that group of age. In the one to four year old children group, there were three entities that showed over-mortality among women. The analysis of the proportional mortality revealed that 40 to 50 percent of deaths in under one year old children were due to gastroenteral and respiratory infections. The probable causes of the male over-mortality observed and the need to determine the regional patterns of mortality are also discussed.
