Herpes simplex virus infection of the neonatal respiratory tract. Three patients with neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection with upper or lower respiratory tract involvement are described. In all three patients, fever and respiratory tract symptoms were the presenting features and occurred in the absence of mucocutaneous lesions or maternal history of HSV Infection. In none of the children was HSV Infection considered likely at the time viral cultures were obtained. These patients demonstrate the need for consideration of HSV in the evaluation of neonatal respiratory tract disease, particularly if it is accompanied by fever and presents after the first several days of life.
