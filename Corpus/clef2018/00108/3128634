Prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in children with and without pharyngitis. The prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and other treatable organisms was studied in children with and without pharyngitis. Children aged 2 to 12 years were evaluated between November 1985 and April 1986 in three family practice offices in the Salt Lake City area. Chlamydia trachomatis was not detected in the pharynx of any of the children studied. Mycoplasma pneumoniae was cultured from 5 percent of the 242 children studied, group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus from 30 percent, non-group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus from 5 percent, Hemophilus influenzae from 4 percent, and Staphylococcus aureus from 14 percent. The symptoms reported were not statistically associated with any organism isolated, and clinical signs of pharyngitis were associated only with the presence of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus. Based on these results, management of pharyngitis in children should continue to be based on the detection and treatment of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus.
