Significance of non-pneumophila Legionella species in adult community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonias. The number of different Legionella species is increasing at an impressive rate. In two prospective studies, one involving 110 intensive-care unit (ICU) patients with mainly nosocomial pneumonias and the other 105 patients with community-acquired pneumonias, we investigated the incidence and significance of Legionella pneumophila and non-pneumophila pneumonias on the basis of 17 different main serogroups. In the first study, 14 ICU patients had 15 (13.6%) Legionella pneumonias, which, in 5 cases (33%), were of non-pneumophila etiology. In the second study, 9 patients with community-acquired pneumonias had 10 (9.5%) Legionella pneumonias. Leading this study were 6 L. gormanii infections, followed by 2 L. dumoffii and only 1 L. pneumophila and 1 L. longbeachae pneumonia. Of the total, 22 of 23 patients with Legionnaires' disease suffered from severe basic diseases and complications (acute renal failure, respiratory insufficiency, etc.) predominant among the nosocomial pneumonias. The mortality rate was significant in these patients at 33% (5 patients) in the ICU group and 10% (1 patient) in the group with community-acquired pneumonias. We conclude that non-pneumophila Legionella species should receive more diagnostic and therapeutic consideration in patients with nosocomial or community-acquired pneumonias.
