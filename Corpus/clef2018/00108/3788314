Changes in the fetal organs and the placenta with intrauterine mycoplasma infection. The effects of intrauterine mycoplasmal infections on the fetus (stillborn) and infant (mostly premature) are presented, based on 80 cases along with findings from 62 placentae with mycoplasmal placental infection. Morphometric, light and immunofluorescent microscopy findings are given. These data were correlated with clinical observations and laboratory parameters including serologic investigations. Damage to various organs including the placenta most frequently involved the epithelium. Mycoplasma multiply principally in the cytoplasm whereby the affected cells increase in size, and pale halos appear around the causative organism. Other microscopic changes have been described in the liver, lungs, kidneys, brain, lymphoid organs and placenta. Macroscopic changes in mycoplasmal and viral infections of the uterine cavity are minimal. Differential manifestations of the disease depending on the mycoplasma species (M. hominis, M. pneumoniae) have been described. Correlations between changes in the placenta and the outcome of pregnancy have been attempted.
