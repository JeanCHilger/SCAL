Prevalence of respiratory illnesses of school children in the industrial, urban and rural areas of Singapore. An epidemiological survey of 3216 primary school children living in the industrial, urban and rural areas of Singapore revealed a high prevalence of various respiratory symptoms and illnesses, with 13.1% cough, 8.2% wheezy chest, 25.9% blocked/running nose, 4.3% sinusitis, 7.8% asthmatic attacks and 4.1% bronchitis/pneumonia. Differences in the prevalence of respiratory illnesses and lung function tests were observed among children in the three areas, but this could not be accounted for by the varying air pollution levels which have been maintained below the long-term standards set up by WHO. It was probably responsible for the differences noted.
