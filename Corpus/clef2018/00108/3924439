Possible role of lysolecithins and nonesterified fatty acids in the pathogenesis of Reye's syndrome, sudden infant death syndrome, acute pancreatitis, and diabetic ketoacidosis. In vitro denaturation and (or) alteration of protein function by detergents have been extensively documented. I suggest that similar biochemical and clinical features of Reye's syndrome, sudden infant death syndrome, acute pancreatitis, and diabetic ketoacidosis may be explained as sequelae of the toxic detergent effects of nonesterified fatty acids and lysolecithins. These diseases may be provoked by a drug-induced diminution of the detergent-buffering capacity of blood or tissue proteins by excess detergents produced in vivo, consequent to lipase activity induced by viral infection or metabolic disease
