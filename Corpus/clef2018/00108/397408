Complement activation in pneumonia. Complement analyses performed on serially collected plasma samples from 10 patients during acute infectious pneumonia or bronchopneumonia showed normal or increased values for hemolytic activity and Clq, C4, C3, and factor B levels. However, the levels of C3 breakdown products (C3d) were significantly (greater than 2 SD) increased in six patients during the first three days of observation, suggesting that hypercatabolism of complement components may occur during the acute phase of infectious pneumonia concomitant with a hypersynthesis of some complement components. Evidence of circulating immune complexes was obtained only in two patients with the 125I-Clq Binding Test.
