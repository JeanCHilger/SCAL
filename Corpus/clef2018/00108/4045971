Spectrum of diseases for house staff education on a VA general medicine inpatient service. A significant portion of internal medicine residency training in the United States today occurs in general medicine sections of Veterans Administration hospitals. The authors studied the demographic, diagnostic, and prognostic characteristics of the patients treated by house staff members rotating through the general medical wards of the Houston, Texas, Veterans Administration (VA) Medical Center. In 2,131 admissions over 13 months, the most frequent primary causes of admissions included congestive heart failure, pneumonia, exacerbation of chronic obstructive lung disease, and malignancy. In 85 percent of the admissions, two or more chronic diseases were present. In 53 percent of admissions, the patients were deemed to be moderately or severely ill on admission. The data indicate that the residents' experience is representative of problems encountered by practicing internists and that VA hospitals make a significant contribution to internal medicine training and thus to the provision of health care for the nation.
