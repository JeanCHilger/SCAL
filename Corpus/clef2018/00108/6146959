The chronic bronchitis complex in children. In childhood, a clear definition, etiology, natural history, therapy, and prognosis have not been described for chronic bronchitis. In fact, its validity as a single disease entity is in question. This article offers a pragmatic approach by considering "chronic bronchitis" as a pathophysiologic description of a symptom complex that results from the interaction of both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. In this schema, the physician should rule out more specific diagnoses and prevent further airway disease by limiting exogenous causes of airway damage and treating identifiable endogenous ones.
