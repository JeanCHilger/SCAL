Necrotizing pancreatitis in renal transplant patients. Acute necrotizing pancreatitis developed in 5 of 405 patients who underwent renal transplantation. All five patients were taking immunosuppressive medication (azathioprine and steroids). Three patients also received rabbit antithymus serum. Alcohol ingestion or cholelithiasis did not play any causative role in the pancreatitis, which began between 7 days and 13 months after renal transplantation. The delay from the time of admission for pancreatitis to surgical exploration was a mean of 17 days. Operative findings included pancreatic necrosis, hemorrhage and abscess formation. All five patients died of the complications of necrotizing pancreatitis--persistent sepsis, respiratory and renal failure, upper gastrointestinal bleeding and disseminated intravascular coagulation. This review demonstrates that prolonged conservative therapy in renal transplant patients with necrotizing pancreatitis is associated with high mortality. The authors believe that earlier surgical intervention will lead to increased survival.
