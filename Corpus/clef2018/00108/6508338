Mycoplasma pneumoniae: acute illness, antibiotics, and subsequent pulmonary function. One hundred and eight children presenting with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection were assessed during the acute illness and followed for three years. The incidence of wheezing with the acute infection (40%) was greater than expected in a normal childhood population. The initial illness precipitated wheezing for the first time in some subjects but others wheezed only with the acute illness. In non-asthmatic subjects significant bronchodilator responsiveness was present one month after infection. Children given erythromycin during the first seven days of their illness had a significantly shorter fever duration compared with those treated inappropriately. No significant effects of treatment were noted on pulmonary function three years later but non-asthmatic children had abnormal mean forced expiratory volume in one second and forced expiratory flow after 50% of the expired vital capacity compared with 64 healthy controls. These findings indicate impaired function three years after initial infection.
