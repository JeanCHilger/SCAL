Hemophilus influenzae pneumonia in the adult. Radiographic appearance with clinical correlation. Hemophilus influenzae septicemia is an important cause of life-threatening pneumonia in an immunocompromised patient. Eleven cases proved by blood culture were analyzed. Multilobar involvement with lobar or segmental consolidation and pleural effusion were common radiographic findings, but there were no signs of lobar expansion, bulging fissures, or cavitation. In general, predisposing factors such as alcoholism and chemotherapy place patients at risk. Radiographic response to therapy is variable but often lags behind clinical improvement.
