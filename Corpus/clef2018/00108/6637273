Characteristics of nonspecific resistance in children with lung diseases due to opportunistic microflora. Acute destructive pneumonia in children was found to be complicated by acute pleural empyema (APE) on days 3-21 of the disease. The time of the development of this complication depended on the state of the nonspecific resistance of the body: the greater was the degree of deficiency as manifested by cell-mediated and humoral immunity indices, the earlier developed APE. Staphylococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infected the pleural cavity of children under the conditions of essentially decreased phagocytic activity, phagocytic index, C'H50 and one of the classes of immunoglobulin. The reaction of the body to staphylococci and P. aeruginosa took its course after the type of primary or secondary immune response, depending on the time of infection.
