Pathophysiological significance of the determination ofthe glucocorticoid concentration in bronchial secretions in children with bronchopulmonary diseases. Simultaneous estimation of glucocorticoid content was carried out in bronchial secretion products and in blood plasma of 95 children with chronic bronchopulmonary pathology. 11-hydroxycorticosteroids were found in bronchial secretion product its concentration depended on the type, phase of the disease and the character of bronchial mucose impairment. The highest content of 11-hydroxycorticosteroids was observed in purulent endo-bronchitis.
