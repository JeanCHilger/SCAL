Metabolic function characteristics and respiratory pathology of premature infants. A total of 143 premature children of the first 3 months of life (the body weight upon birth 1200-2500 g) staying at a specialized hospital, and 28 children (the body weight upon birth 1100-2500 g) under 3 years staying at a pulmonological sanatorium were examined. Studies on enzymatic functions (uropepsin, glutathione, protease and lipase activity in the blood serum) revealed a decrease in adaptation processes in premature children with acute pneumonia, and during reconvalescence in children with hypotrophy. In premature neonates on formula feeding with a mixture of "Malyutka", the content of total lipids, cholesterol and phospholipids was lower than in children on natural feeding. The content of free fatty acids and acetone tended towards an increase during formula feeding. Pneumonia incidence in premature children was 4 times higher in the first year of life and 2 1/2-2 times higher in the second and third years of life, as compared to full-term babies. The respiratory diseases in premature children were followed by the asthmatic syndrome. The results obtained may be used for the development of dietetic management of premature children with pneumonia and hypotrophy.
