The radiological morphology of neonatal pneumonia (author's transl). 71 chest X-rays of newborns with pneumonia were analysed in respect ot pathologic changes. The main radiologic symptoms were localized, coarse spotted, striated and homogeneous shadows. Inconstantly interstitial structures were found in addition as a direct sign for the inflammatory infiltration. In a high percentage different kinds of overinflation and irregular aeration were demonstrated as indirect signs. The differentiation to Hyaline membranes is easy usually. In some neonates the exclusion of a cardiac-shunt especially with decompensation, the evaluation of a pulmonary bleeding or wet lung can be difficult. In these cases the clinical report in combination with the radiologic findings will lead to a correct diagnosis.
