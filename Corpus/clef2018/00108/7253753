Pneumonia due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Clinicoradiological study of 28 cases (author's transl). Pneumonia due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae may present at any age after age five. The clinical picture varies from an acute febrile illness to a prolonged disease with affected general state and little pulmonary involvement. The radiological picture is varied but the alveolar pattern predominates, making the differential diagnosis with the bacterial pneumonias difficult. However, in the presence of an interstitial or mixed pattern, especially if generalized, pneumonia due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae must be suspected. This radiological picture is particularly frequent in elderly patients, often affected by other diseases able to induce immunodepression. In such patients the radiology and the unspecific clinical picture frequently cause diagnostic delays. The presence of a pneumonia with multisystem involvement (blood, nervous system, joints, etc.) should suggest the possibility of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection.
