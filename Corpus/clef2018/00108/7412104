Bronchial ECG leads in the diagnosis of the initial forms of cor pulmonale. The authors suggest a modified method for recording bronchial ECG leads by means for recording bronchial ECG leads by means of a catheter-electrode of their design which is introduced through the inner canal of an optic broncho-fibroscope under local anesthesia. The electrode is adjusted in the right inferior bronchus on a level with the 7th segment. The bronchial ECG leads were analyzed in 122 persons (in 25 healthy individuals and 97 patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency). A conclusion is drawn that bronchial ECG leads make it possible to diagnose early involvement of the right atrium in the pathological process relatively often. In destructive changes in the lungs, the degree of right atrial overloading increases. As compared to ordinary orthogonal leads, bronchial ECG leads increase the efficacy of cor pulmonate diagnosis significantly.
