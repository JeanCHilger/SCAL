Pediatric gastroesophageal reflux: age-specific indications for operation. Pediatric gastroesophageal reflux is common and its complications may be serious. The diagnosis is being suspected and confirmed with increasing frequency in children because of heightened awareness of the symptoms peculiar to pediatric patients. Thirty-one children who underwent Nissen fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux are reviewed. Diagnosis was obtained by barium meal, isotope scanning, esophagoscopy and pH monitoring. Failure to thrive, recurrent pneumonia, apnea, feeding difficulty and esophageal stricture unresponsive to medical management were the indications for operation. Children with brain damage or previous repair of esophageal atresia are at high risk for gastroesophageal reflux and its complications. A protective fundoplication is a desirable adjunct to feeding gastrostomy in brain-damaged children. Fundoplication eliminated reflux in 30 of 31 patients, relieved symptoms in 28 and improved symptoms in 2. Nissen fundoplication is a safe and effective surgical procedure for correction of gastroesophageal reflux in children.
