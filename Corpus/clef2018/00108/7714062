Routine diagnosis of seven respiratory viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae by enzyme immunoassay. A composite EIA, using 8-well microstrips, was used for the rapid detection of seven respiratory viruses and M. pneumoniae. The viruses included influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3, adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus. During the 61 month period--June 1988 to June 1993--17326 respiratory specimens, submitted from three states, were tested by this EIA. The specimens were mainly from a paediatric population (hospitals and private physicians). RSV was the predominant virus detected, followed by adenovirus, parainfluenza 3, M. pneumoniae, influenza A, parainfluenza 2, influenza B and parainfluenza 1. The use of blocking antibodies confirmed the identification of the agents, in particular with samples showing absorbance values greater than the cutoff with more than one infectious agent. Different methods for processing specimens in order to obtain a uniform suspension, and interpretation of non-specific reactions, are discussed. The assays showed an average sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 99%, compared to virus culture. This EIA system provided an efficient method for the rapid diagnosis of viral and mycoplasmal infections in a busy diagnostic laboratory.
