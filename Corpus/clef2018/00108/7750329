Patterns of cytokine expression in community-acquired pneumonia. Pneumonia continues to be a major cause of disease and death among patients worldwide. Aspects of the host response to infection, such as the release of cytokines, may be contributing to the persistent morbidity and mortality.Plasma levels of cytokines interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) were measured in critically ill patients with pneumonia (ICUP n = 12) and less severely ill patients with pneumonia (NONICUPAll cytokine concentrations were highest in the ICUP group. In the case of IL-1 beta, levels were significantly higher in the ICUP group when compared with the noninfected POSTOP group. The acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II scores were identical in these two groups (17 +/- 3 [SD] and 10 +/- 1, respectively, not significantly different). Intermediate levels were found in those groups with intermediate levels of infection. The IL-6 levels were not significantly different between the groups and in particular, the levels in the ICUP and POSTOP groups were similar. The TNF-alpha levels tended to mimic those of IL-1 beta, although the significant difference found was between the ICUP and NONICUP groups which had significantly different APACHE II scores (17 +/- 3 vs 4.4 +/- 1, respectively). No association between cytokine levels and patient mortality was demonstrated.Among the cytokines, IL-1 beta appeared to be associated with the severity of infection, IL-6 appears to reflect severity of stress whether of infection or noninfective origin, and TNF-alpha may be a marker of severity of pneumonia.
