Measles in adults. An unforeseen consequence of immunization? An outbreak of measles occurred in California in the first half of 1975, especially in the San Francisco Bay area. Of four adult patients with complicated cases, two were receiving immunosuppressive chemotherapy, and both died from a giant-cell pneumonia. The clinical presentation in such cases may be atypical, and special viral isolation and immunofluorescent techniques may be diagnostically helpful. A significant (P less than .0005) trend toward the occurrence of measles in adolescents was observed in this epidemic, which may also occur in future epidemics elsewhere. With wide spread but incomplete immunization, it is possible for the nonimmunized to reach adulthood without acquiring natural infection. As a result, internists as well as pediatricians will have to consider the possibility of measles and be aware of its serious potential in the immunosuppressed patient.
