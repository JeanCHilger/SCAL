Epidemiology of lower respiratory tract infections in children. Lower respiratory tract infections--croup, tracheo-bronchitis, bronchiolitis and pneumonia--represent one of the major causes of pediatric consultation. They occur most frequently during the first years of life, are usually not recurrent and require hospitalization in less than 2% of the cases. They are associated in time with epidemics of respiratory virus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections, but the role of bacteria as primary infectious agents, or as causes of superinfection is significant.
