Interventional antimicrobial therapy in febrile neutropenic patients. Study Group of the Paul Ehrlich Society for Chemotherapy. In this prospective multicenter trial, treatment strategies for 1573 patients with neutropenia < 1000/microliters and fever > or = 38.5 degrees C after cytotoxic chemotherapy were compared. Patients with unexplained fever were randomized to a three-phase sequential study for different established drug regimens. If an infection could be defined microbiologically or clinically, treatment modifications were determined. In phase I, treatment for all patients consisted of acylaminopenicillin (PEN) plus aminoglycoside (AMG) or third-generation cephalosporin (CEPH) plus AMG
