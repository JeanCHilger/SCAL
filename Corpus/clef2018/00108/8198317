Choreoathetotic movement disorder in a boy with Mycoplasma pneumoniae encephalitis. We present a case of a 10-year-old boy who presented to the emergency department with high fever, acute choreoathetosis, weakness, and dysarthria. An EEG showed generalized slowing, and serologies defined an acute case of Mycoplasma pneumoniae encephalitis. This report describes the most common presentations, therapy, and outcomes of M pneumoniae encephalitis.
