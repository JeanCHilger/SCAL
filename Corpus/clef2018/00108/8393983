Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumopathies in children: clinical, biological and radiological study. Clinical, radiological and biological features of 19 cases of serologically proven Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia were compared with those of 21 cases of other types of pneumonia. Some clinical features were more frequent in M pneumoniae: patients older than 5 years, association with upper respiratory tract infection, skin rashes, acute course, unsuccessful treatment with penicillin. There were no specific radiological features. When compared with the complement fixation method, the serological diagnosis using agglutination technique appears to be more sensitive.
