Respiratory syncytial virus illnesses in human immunodeficiency virus- and noninfected children. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract and febrile upper respiratory tract illnesses were prospectively assessed in cohorts of 83 infants born to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)- and of 48 infants born to non-HIV-infected mothers. Of the infants born to HIV-infected mothers, 18 were themselves infected with HIV, 26 were indeterminant and 39 were free from HIV. Ten RSV illnesses occurred in 8 HIV-infected, 2 illnesses in 2 indeterminant and 17 illnesses occurred in 17 non-HIV-infected children. RSV shedding was prolonged in HIV class P2- vs. non-HIV-infected children, at medians of 30 days (range, 1 to 199 days) and 6 days (range, 1 to 21 days), respectively (P = 0.02). Ribavirin and intravenous immunoglobulin failed to eradicate RSV from one child who shed virus for 199 days. Wheezing occurred in 1 of 4 vs. 9 of 10 episodes of lower respiratory tract illness in HIV-infected and non-HIV-infected children, respectively (P = 0.04). No differences were noted in duration of illness, temperature, respiratory rate or oxygen saturation between HIV- and non-HIV-infected children. Infection control and public health concerns regarding prolonged shedding of RSV in HIV-infected children must be recognized.
