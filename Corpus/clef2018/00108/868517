Complete heart block in a young child presumably due to mycoplasma pneumoniae myocarditis. The case is described of an 18 months old boy with sudden onset complete heart block, heralded by Stokes-Adams attacks. General signs of viral illness preceded and accompanied the syndrome this, along with angiographic evidence of poorly contracting left ventricle, led to the diagnosis of non bacterial myocarditis. Serologic tests disclosed a significant rise in antibodies against mycoplasma pneumoniae (1/16 to 1/128). The His-bundle electrogram showed a block above the His-bundle, but fairly widespread damage to the conduction system is suspected. The complete heart block proved to be permanent and a fixed rate pacemaker had to be implanted.
