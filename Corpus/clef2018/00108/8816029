Fast breathing in the diagnosis of pneumonia--a reassessment. In this hospital-based prospective study, a total of 222 children presenting with cough and/or breathlessness were screened for presence of lower respiratory infection. All clinically-detected cases of LRI and every fifth case of URI were investigated. Pneumonia was defined as presence of abnormal shadows on chest roentgenograms, against which the clinical symptoms and signs were assessed for their utility in the diagnosis of pneumonia. Fast breathing was found to be the most useful sign predicting pneumonia in all age groups. Cut-off points at 50 breaths/min for infants including neonates, 40 breaths/min for children aged 12-35 months, and 30 breaths/min for children aged 36-60 months indicated presence of pneumonia. Crepitations on auscultation of chest was found to have good correlation with presence of radiological pneumonia. Other signs like chest indrawing and cyanosis were found to be highly specific signs in detecting pneumonia, but had low sensitivity.
