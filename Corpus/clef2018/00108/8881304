Neurologic manifestations of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections. Some neurological manifestations associated with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection have been reported, such as meningoencephalitis, cerebellitis, aseptic meningitis, polyradiculopathy, transverse myelitis, cranial nerve palsies and myositis.Case 1. A 10 year-old boy had an acute pneumonia that was subsequently proven to be due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. This infection was resistant to macrolid administration for 1 week requiring the administration of vibramycin instead. At that time, the patient developed an aseptic meningitis syndrome and a severe cerebellitis. He completely recovered within a few days. Case 2. A boy was admitted because he suffered from polyradiculopathy that had appeared during an acute episode of pneumonia. The neurological involvement extended to cranial nerves, then subsequently completely disappeared. Seroimmunological studies confirmed the Myoplasma pneumoniae infection.The mechanism of these classical but rare neurological manifestations remains unclear.
