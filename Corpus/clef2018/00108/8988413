A clinical evaluation of azithromycin in the treatment of pediatric infection. Fine granule preparation of azithromycin (AZM), a new macrolide antibiotic, was given to treat various infections in pediatric patients. Efficacies of AZM in a total of 21 patients (tonsillitis in six, bronchitis in five, pneumonia in five, impetigo contagiosa in three, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome in one and bacterial enterogastritis in one) were rated "excellent" in 11 patients and "good" in eight. The remaining two cases were not included in the evaluation. AZM eradicated all strains of infection-causative bacteria identified in the 21 patients: Staphylococcus aureus in two, Streptococcus pneumoniae in four, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis in four, Haemophilus influenzae in six, Haemophilus parainfluenzae in three and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in one. One patient complained of mild diarrhea, while two patients showed increases in eosinophils as abnormal laboratory changes.
