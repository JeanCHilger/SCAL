Pharmacokinetic and clinical evaluations of azithromycin in the pediatric field. Azithromycin (AZM), an oral macrolide antibiotic drug, was studied for its efficacy and pharmacokinetics in the treatment of pediatric patients with respiratory tract infections. The results of the study are presented. Fifteen pediatric patients in an age range between 1 and 10 years were given 8.9 to 14.7 mg/ kg body weight of AZM once daily for 3 to 4 days. Pharmacokinetics of AZM in three patients were examined. AZM concentration in plasma was 0.037 microgram/ml at 72 hours after final dosing, while urine concentration was 10.9 micrograms/ml measured during a period between 72 and 96 hours post-dosing. Fourteen patient cases were included in analysis of drug efficacy for AZM. AZM was found "markedly effective" in all seven patients with pneumonia, and "effective" in all three patients with acute bronchitis, two patients with mycoplasmal pneumonia, and one patient with tonsillitis. In one patient with mycoplasmal bronchitis, AZM was found slightly effective. The efficacy rate was 92.9% (13/14). The study found one case of side effect, moderate diarrhea. No laboratory abnormality was documented. In conclusion, an antibiotic AZM was found useful in a treatment of pediatric respiratory tract infections.
