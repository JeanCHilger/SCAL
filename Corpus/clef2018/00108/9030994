Crohn's disease associated with colo-bronchial fistula. An 18-year-old female patient with Crohn's disease presented with left lower lobe pneumonia and pleural effusion which were resistant to treatment with antibiotics. Colo-bronchial fistula had not been recognized until she coughed up yellow sputa with feculent odor and developed acute respiratory distress syndrome. This type of fistula is a rare complication of Crohn's disease, but the present case certainly alerts physicians to search for a fistula between the bronchus and gastrointestinal tract when encountering patients with Crohn's disease accompanied by antibiotic-resistant chronic pneumonia.
