Community acquired pneumonia. Reliability of the criteria for deciding ambulatory treatment. To determine whether criteria for not admitting community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients diagnosed in the emergency room are appropriate, and to characterize the symptoms, etiology and course of CAP. This one-year prospective, protocol study of immunocompetent CAP patients diagnosed in the emergency room of our hospital enrolled patients not considered to require hospital admission according to the recommendations of the Spanish Society of Respiratory Disease (SEPAR). Medical histories, chest X-rays and blood analysis were obtained for all patients. Blood cultures were analyzed for antibodies against Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Coxiella burnetii, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia psittaci and influenza virus types A and B. The patients received erythromycin for 14 days and were regularly checked by the pulmonologist in the outpatient clinic until signs and symptoms had disappeared. One hundred six patients were enrolled. Mean age was 36 +/- 13 years. Only 3 patients had to be admitted to hospital, after which outcome was good. The main symptoms were fever (106, 100%) and cough (83, 78%). In 46 (43.4%) chest sounds were normal. Microbiologic diagnoses were achieved for 28 (26.4%) and Coxiella burnetii was the agent most often found (19, 17.9%). Outcome was good in all cases, with faster disappearance of symptoms than of radiological signs. The SEPAR criteria for admitting patients with CAP are appropriate. The clinical symptoms of such patients are non specific, a noteworthy finding being that many patients had normal chest sounds. Coxiella burnetii was the most common causative agent. Both clinical and radiological outcomes were excellent.
