Comparison of oral cefuroxime axetil and oral amoxycillin/clavulanate in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. Cefuroxime axetil has been evaluated previously in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections, but not specifically in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. In a multicentre, investigator-blinded clinical trial, 162 patients with community-acquired pneumonia were randomly assigned to receive orally either cefuroxime axetil 500 mg bid (n = 84) or amoxycillin/clavulanate 500 mg/125 mg tid (n = 78) for 10 days. Organisms were isolated from the pretreatment sputum specimens of 97 of 162 (60%) patients, the commonest isolates being Streptococcus pneumoniae (38%) and Haemophilus influenzae (18%). A satisfactory clinical outcome (cure or improvement) was achieved in 100% (55 of 55) and 96% (49 of 51) of the clinically evaluable patients treated with cefuroxime axetil or amoxycillin/clavulanate, respectively (P = 0.23). With respect to eradication of bacterial pathogens, a satisfactory outcome (cure, presumed cure or cure with colonization) was obtained in 94% (32 of 34) and 93% (37 of 40) of bacteriologically evaluable patients treated with cefuroxime axetil or amoxycillin/clavulanate, respectively (P = 1.00). Both treatment regimens used in this study were well tolerated. The most common drug-related adverse experiences were gastrointestinal events, reported by 8% and 4%, respectively, of the patients in the amoxycillin/clavulanate and cefuroxime axetil groups, a difference which was not statistically significant (P = 0.32). These results indicate that cefuroxime axetil twice a day is as effective as amoxycillin/clavulanate three times a day in the treatment of outpatients with mild to moderate community-acquired pneumonia.
