Lower airway inflammation in infants and young children with cystic fibrosis. Airway inflammation is an important component of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. To determine whether this begins early in the illness, before the onset of infection, we examined bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from 46 newly diagnosed infants with CF under the age of 6 mo identified by a neonatal screening program. These infants were divided into three groups: 10 had not experienced respiratory symptoms or received antibiotics and pathogens were absent in their BAL fluid 18 had clear evidence of lower respiratory viral or bacterial (> or = 10(5) CFU/ml) infection
