Effect of inflammatory diseases of the pulmonary parenchyma on ventilatory function in school children and adolescents. The group of 35 children and adolescents aged from 7 18 years with previous inflammatory diseases of lung parenchyma, pneumonias and tuberculosis, in clinically nonactive phase was compared with the control group of 35 healthy children and adolescents. The results of the ventilation tests in the two groups were analyzed by t-test. Results showed statistically significantly lower values of one-second forced expiratory volume, Tiffeneau index, peak-expiratory flow, forced expiratory flow between 25 and 75% of vital capacity, and flow rates at 50 and 25% of the vital capacity in the affected group. The children with previous inflammatory diseases of lung parenchyma showed the initial obstructive ventilatory disorders of large and small airways. This partly disagrees with generalized including of these diseases in the causes of restrictive ventilatory disorders. The obtained results point to the need for examining ventilatory lung function in children and young people, in asymptomatic phase, in order to reveal latent obstructions and prevent possible disorders in adults.
