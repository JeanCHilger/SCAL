Growth, morbidity, and mortality of children in Dhaka after treatment for severe malnutrition: a prospective study. Over 1300 severely malnourished children (< 60% of US National Center for Health Statistics weight-for-height, with edema, or both) are admitted each year to the Children's Nutrition Unit in Dhaka. Fatality during treatment is low and recovery is rapid. Our aim was to determine whether this initial success is sustained when children return home. A previous attempt to address this question was frustrated by the difficulty in tracing children after discharge because most are from slum settlements and families move frequently. This prospective study with fortnightly monitoring was therefore undertaken. The main outcomes of interest were anthropometric status, relapse, morbidity, and mortality. Children (n = 437) who had been treated for severe malnutrition when aged 12-59 mo and had reached the discharge criterion of 80% of weight-for-height, were followed for the next 12 mo. During follow-up, 7.5% were lost without trace, 0.6% relapsed, and 2.3% died. Morbidity was high, with a mean of seven episodes of diarrhea during the year. Outpatient visits for diarrhea occurred for 67% of children, and 58% had pneumonia (10% had pneumonia three times). After 12 mo, mean weight-for-height was 91% (-0.92 z score) but mean height-for-age remained at 84% (-4.14 z score). Weight gain, but not height gain, tended to be lower in children who experienced more diarrhea. Fever and cough were not associated with either weight or height gain. The high prevalence of illness highlights the need for continued accessible health care and for interventions to reduce disease acquisition.
