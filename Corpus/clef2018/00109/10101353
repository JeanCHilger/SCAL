Independent radiologic prognostic factors for fatal outcome of ambulatory-acquired pneumonia requiring inpatient treatment. To evaluate the independent prognostic impact of the chest radiograph for mortality from community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization.Chest radiographs of 67 patients with hospital-treated community-acquired pneumonia were analyzed with regard to the prognostic implications of radiographic patterns, extent and density of infiltrates, and its evolution during treatment.Non-survivors had a significantly higher extent of infiltrates (p = 0.008), density of infiltrates (p = 0.05), and radiographic spread during follow-up within 48-75 hours (p = 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, persistent or progressive infiltrates were associated with a 47-fold increase, and persistent or progressive density of infiltrates with an 18-fold increase in risk of mortality. The presence of both parameters could correctly predict 96% of survivors and 90% of non-survivors.The chest radiograph is an independent predictor of the severity of pneumonia. Both persistent or progressive infiltrates and persistent or progressive density of infiltrates are independently associated with mortality from community-acquired pneumonia.
