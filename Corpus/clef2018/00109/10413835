Congenital syphilis: late diagnosis in spite of screening. We report the case of an infant in whom congenital syphilis was diagnosed at the age of 5 weeks. The case is remarkable because of (a) the negative venereal disease laboratory test from the cord blood, (b) the incidental diagnosis of the disease in the fifth week of life, (c) pneumonia alba being one of the symptoms, (d) the occurrence of a mild Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction after initiation of penicillin therapy and (e) the successful treatment of infection related anaemia with recombinant human erythropoietin.
