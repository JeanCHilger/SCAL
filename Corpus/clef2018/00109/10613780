Pulmonary function, serum markers of inflammation, and IgG antibodies to core lipopolysaccharide of Burkholderia cepacia in adults with cystic fibrosis, following colonization with Burkholderia cepacia. Eight patients with cystic fibrosis [CF] colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) had serial lung function, peripheral blood inflammatory markers, and serum IgG antibodies to Burkholderia cepacia (B. cepacia) lipopolysaccharide measured in the months preceding and following colonisation with B. cepacia. One patient experienced a fall in FEV(1) from 33% to 19% of predicted values, coinciding with the first sputum isolation of B. cepacia, and he died 12 weeks later. He had a rise in inflammatory markers preterminally, and this change was refractory to antibiotic therapy. There was no significant fall in FEV(1) % of predicted values in the remaining seven patients, and no significant changes in their serum markers of inflammation following colonization with B. cepacia over a median (range) period of 10.9 (7.3-12.0) months.
