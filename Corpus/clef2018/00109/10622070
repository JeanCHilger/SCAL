Comparison of spiramycin and clarithromycin for community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections. This open multicentre study compared the efficacy and tolerability of clarithromycin and spiramycin in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections in Brazil and Colombia. A total of 125 patients with a clinical and radiological diagnosis of pneumonia, acute bronchitis or exacerbation of chronic bronchitis were randomised to receive oral doses of either clarithromycin (500 mg) or spiramycin (3 MIU) every 12 hours for courses of 5-10 days. Patients were assessed before the start of treatment, and at days 3-4 and days 9-17. Twenty-six (26) patients (16 in the spiramycin group and 10 in the clarithromycin group) reported adverse events, seven of whom withdrew from the trial. Statistical analysis detected no significant differences between efficacy (p = 0.768) or tolerability (p = 0.236) for the two treatment groups. Spiramycin therefore has similar efficacy to clarithromycin in the treatment of community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections.
