Ureaplasma urealyticum pneumonia and isolation of U. urealyticum from endotracheal tube aspirates of preterm and full-term infants. Our purpose was to investigate how many preterm infants with a birth weight </=1,250 g and how many newborns with one >1,250 g with clinical symptoms had Ureaplasma urealyticum in their endotracheal tube aspirates, and how many of them had pneumonia.The patients were divided into two groups (group 1: birth weight </=1,250 g, n = 25 group 2: birth weight >1,250 g, n = 45), and these two groups were subdivided into two subgroups (subgroup a: U. urealyticum in aspirate without pneumoniaIn group 1, there were 25 patients. Nine patients (36%) had U. urealyticum in their aspirates, 5 patients (20%) had pneumonia (group 1b), and 4 patients (16%) did not (group 1a). Infants with pneumonia showed a significant increase in parameters of mechanical ventilation, in the duration of mechanical ventilation, and in the duration of oxygen dependence as compared with subgroup 1a. In group 2, there were 45 patients. Six patients of group 2 (13%) had U. urealyticum in their aspirates, 2 patients (4.4%) had a pneumonia (group 2b), and 4 patients (8.8%) did not (group 2b).In preterm infants as well as in term newborns one should consider U. urealyticum as a potential cause of neonatal pneumonia.
