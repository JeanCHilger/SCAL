Therapeutic effect of clarithromycin for respiratory-tract infections in children caused by Chlamydia pneumoniae. Research Group of Sapporo for Pediatric Chlamydial Infections. Children infected with Chlamydia pneumoniae sometimes experience lower respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia and bronchitis. Although numerous anti-microbial compounds have been reported to be active against the organism, most of them have not been in a clinical trial in infants and children with C. pneumoniae infection. Clarithromycin has been shown to express anti-chlamydial effects in vitro. In this study, we evaluated the clinical anti-C. pneumoniae properties of clarithromycin in children with mainly lower respiratory tract infection. We administered clarithromycin orally to 21 infants and children at a dose of 10-15 mg/kg/day divided into two or three doses for 4-21 days. Clinical symptoms, roentgenographic and laboratory abnormal findings improved. The overall clinical efficacy rate was 85.7% (18 of 21 cases). Administration of clarithromycin was considered to be a suitable treatment for improving lower respiratory infections in infants and children caused by C. pneumoniae.
