Discrepancy between CYP2D6 phenotype and genotype derived from post-mortem dextromethorphan blood level. To describe the death of a toddler after a therapeutic dose of dextromethorphan and its investigation.Case report, cytochrome P450 phenotype and genotype determination in the victim and post-mortem drug redistribution study performed in rats.A 20-month Asian male who received 3 mg of dextromethorphan once at 09:00 h and again at 22:00 h was found dead at 04:35 h. Post-mortem examination showed signs of early bronchopneumonia (bacterial cultures were negative) dextromethorphan and dextrorphan blood concentrations taken from the heart cavity were 500 ng/ml (1. 84 micromol/l) and 200 ng/ml (0.78 micromol/l), respectively. Despite the dextromethorphan level being almost 100-fold higher than expected after therapeutic doses, intentional or unintentional overdose was extremely unlikelyCYP450 phenotypes derived from post-mortem blood levels should be interpreted with caution and preferably confirmed by a genotype analysis.
