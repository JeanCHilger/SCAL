Acute laryngotracheobronchitis in Nigerian children. In a prospective study of cases of severe acute respiratory infections seen at the University College Hospital, Ibadan over a 30-month period, 39 cases were found to have acute upper airway obstruction out of this number, acute laryngotracheobronchitis (croup) accounted for 35 (90%). The ages of the 35 ranged from 2 to 53 months with 86% being less than 3 years old, while there was a male preponderance (M:F ratio, 1.7:1). Croup was associated with bronchopneumonia in 29%, measles in 2.9%, and with both in 40% of the 35 cases. The mean respiratory rate in patients in whom croup co-existed with measles and pneumonia was significantly higher than that in patients with croup alone (P < 0.001). Six (55%) of the eleven viral identifications made were Parainfluenza virus types 1-3, while Respiratory syncytial virus was identified in three patients. Of the 18 blood cultures done, only one was positive, yielding Klebsiella pneumoniae in a two-year old undernourished child with associated measles and bronchopneumonia. Mortality was 11%
