Guillain-Barré syndrome and Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. Guillain-Barré syndrome subsequent to Mycoplasma pneumoniae is uncommon and difficult to confirm. We report one case. Clinical presentation and therapy were unremarkable. The interest of antibiotics (preventive or curative) is unresolved. The pathophysiology remains hypothetical but Mycoplasma pneumoniae and some surface gangliosides of peripheral nerves share homologous epitopes leading to the production of antibodies. Induced antibodies to ganglioside may cross-react with neural tissues.
