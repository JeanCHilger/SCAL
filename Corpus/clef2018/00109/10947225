Pulmonary involvement in leptospirosis. The objective of this study was to assess the incidence of pulmonary involvement in a cohort of 26 patients in whom a diagnosis of leptospirosis had been made. Seventeen of the 26 patients had respiratory symptoms. Of these 17 patients, 13 had radiographs showing pulmonary abnormality. The most frequent finding was a bilateral patchy alveolar-acinar pattern in six patients. Three patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and died due to multiorgan failure. Only cigarette smoking was significantly associated with respiratory involvement (odds ratio, 19.2 95% CI, 1.7-250
