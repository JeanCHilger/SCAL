Pulmonary complications occurring after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. To explore the risk factors for and pathogenesis of pulmonary complications (PC) occurred after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT).The PC in 185 patients undergone allo-BMT were analyzed.Ninety-three PC episodes were observed in 89 patients and most of them were due to infections, including bacterial pneumonia (n = 27), interstitial pneumonia (n = 7), pulmonary fungus disease (n = 16), tuberculosis (n = 4), obstructive lung disease (n = 2), pulmonary edema (n = 2), lung abscess (n = 1) and 34 episodes caused by two or more pathogens. The overall mortality for PC was 12.43% (23/185).The risk factors for PC occurred after allo-BMT were not related to age and sex of recipients, bone marrow status before BMT, conditioning regimen and pulmonary function. Graft-versus-host-disease significantly increased the morbidity and mortality of PC after allo-BMT.
