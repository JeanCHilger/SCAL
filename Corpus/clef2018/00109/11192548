Bronchiolitis obliterans in children: clinical profile and diagnosis. The aim of the study was to determine the clinical profile, aetiology and radiological categories in children diagnosed with bronchiolitis obliterans (BO).We undertook a review of the medical records and radiological studies of 14 children with BO.Unresolving cough and wheeze after a short respiratory illness was the commonest presentation. A viral pneumonitis was identified as the initial respiratory event prior to the development of BO in six children and Mycoplasma pneumoniae was the cause in another three children. Chest X-ray findings could be divided into four distinct patterns that were hyperinflation (n=5), mixed pattern of atelectasis, hyperlucency and bronchial thickening (n=4), unilateral small hyperlucent lung (n=3) and unilateral collapse of one lung (n=2). High resolution computed tomogram (HRCT) chest showing areas of hyperaeration and mosaic ground glass patterns with bronchial thickening were commonly found in patients whose chest X-ray showed bilateral changes. Patients with bilateral lung changes were more likely to have failure to thrive and persistent respiratory symptoms on follow up.A diagnosis of BO can be made from typical clinical features combined with an understanding of the different chest X-ray categories and HRCT of the chest. A viral aetiology was the commonest cause for BO in our series.
