Shed L-selectin (sCD62L) load in trauma patients. Low circulating plasma concentrations of the leukocyte adhesion molecule L-selectin (sCD62L) were found to be associated with an increased risk for subsequent lung failure and case fatality after severe trauma. The objective of this study was to determine the robustness of soluble L-selectin, correcting for a broad spectrum of physiological variables.Patients with suspected multiple and/or trunk injuries were enrolled into this study over a 1-year period. Plasma samples were obtained on hospital presentation, and circulating soluble L-selectin was measured with a commercially available ELISA kit. Study records comprised all relevant clinical and laboratory data. Thirty-day survival rate, subsequent acute lung failure, and nosocomial pneumonia were defined as study endpoints. Statistical analysis was performed using multivariate logistic regression models.Seventy patients with a mean age of 35.51 years (range, 10-87 years) and a mean ISS score of 36.61 (95% CI, 31.08-42.14) entered the study. Eleven patients died, leading to an attributable mortality of 15.70%. L-Selectin levels did not differ between survivors and nonsurvivors. Five patients progressed to acute lung injury, whereas 11 patients developed hospital-acquired pneumonia. Lower L-selectin levels indicated patients at risk for lung injury with a relative odds estimated at 4.43 (P = 0.017). Statistical significance diminished in the multivariate model. In contrast, plasma concentrations of circulating sCD62L were significantly decreased in patients developing nosocomial pneumonia (P = 0.023), with a twofold increased relative odds (OR, 1.96 95% CI, 0.51-7.50). No effect modification was observed by the included covariables.The results of this study highlight the independent predictive value of initially decreased soluble L-selectin levels for the identification of patients susceptible to subsequent respiratory complications after severe trauma.
