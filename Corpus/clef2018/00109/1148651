Incidental appendicectomy with laparotomy for trauma. Incidental appendicectomy was performed in 83 of 206 patients undergoing laparotomy for abdominal trauma. No organs were injured in 42 per cent of the appendicectomy patients and in 17 per cent of the non-appendicetomy patients, thus making comparison between the groups unreliable. While the incidence of intestinal perforation was 21 per cent in the appendicectomy patients, the rate of wound infection was only 7 per cent. One complication (pelvic abscess) was possibly attributable to incidental appendicetomy. Since males below the age of 50 face a significant risk of future appendicitis and represent the majority of patients with abdominal trauma, it may be advisable to perform incidental appendicectomy with laparotomy for trauma in such patients. Specific indications for incidental appendicectomy during laparotomy for trauma are suggested.
