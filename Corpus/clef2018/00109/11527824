Significant role of interleukin-8 in pathogenesis of pulmonary disease due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. We found elevated levels of interleukin-8 in pleural fluid samples from patients with pleural effusion and with a sustained fibrotic change of the lung due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. This result suggests a critical role of interleukin-8 in the pathogenesis of a certain type of pulmonary disease caused by M. pneumoniae.
