Use of antimicrobial agents for community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections in hospitalised children. Data collected from 613 children aged 2-14 years who had been hospitalized for acute bronchitis, wheezing, or pneumonia were analysed to evaluate the prescribing practices of pediatricians treating community-acquired lower respiratory tract infection. Antibiotics were prescribed for 92.1% of the children: 85% had acute bronchitis, 72% had wheezing, and 97.9% had pneumonia. A high frequency of antibiotic overuse and inappropriate prescriptions was noted. In order to contain costs and limit the risk of resistant bacteria emerging, it is urgent that pediatricians and parents be educated in the proper use of antibiotics.
