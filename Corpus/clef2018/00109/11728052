Mycoplasma pneumoniae non-pulmonary infection presenting with pharyngitis, polyarthritis and localized exanthem. We report a case of pharyngitis, polyarthritis and localized exanthem in acute Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection not involving the lower respiratory tract. Diagnosis was made by means of a particle agglutination test and IgM/IgG indirect immunofluorescence assay. This case describes a clinical complex never reported before and suggests the need for a high index of suspicion in cases of atypical presentation of M. pneumoniae infection.
