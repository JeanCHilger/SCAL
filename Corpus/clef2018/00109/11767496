Roentgenomorphological correlations in the diagnosis of pneumonias in patients with combined, craniocerebral, thermal injury and exogenous poisonings. The clinical roentgenological and postmortem morphological data were analyzed and correlated in 219 patients with combined (60), craniocerebral (38), thermal (46) injury and exogenous poisonings (75), who developed pneumonias in the course of the treatment. All the patients underwent chest roentgenography in the anteroposterior projection and in the supine position. The rate of intravital identification of pneumonias accounted for 73.3% in combined, 63% in craniocerebral, 65.2% in thermal injury, and for 77.3% in exogenous poisonings. The roentgenological and morphological characteristics common to the development of pneumonias in different injuries were revealed and the causes of diagnostic discrepancies were analyzed.
