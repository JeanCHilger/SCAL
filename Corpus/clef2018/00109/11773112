Evaluation of four commercial immunoglobulin G (IgG)- and IgM-specific enzyme immunoassays for diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections. The four following commercially available enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) were assessed and compared for their performance in detecting Mycoplasma pneumoniae immunoglobulin G (IgG)- and IgM-specific antibodies Platelia EIA, ImmunoWELL M. pneumoniae ELISA IgG and IgM, ETI-MP-IgG and IgM EIAs and Biotest anti-M. pneumoniae IgG and IgM ELISA (referred to herein as EIA-Platelia, EIA-BMD, EIA-Sorin, and EIA-Biotest). Three groups of patients were investigated: 39 patients (27 children and 12 adults) with respiratory infections who tested positive by PCR for M. pneumoniae in respiratory specimens (group I 52 serum samples), 61 healthy children and adults (group II
