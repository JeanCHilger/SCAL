Endothelial perturbation in cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterized by a persistent inflammatory state, which can be secondary to chronic pulmonary infection and may affect vascular endothelium. We measured circulating levels of von Willebrand factor (vWF), tissue-plasminogen activator (t-PA), and P-selectin in 20 CF patients and 20 healthy subjects. vWF, t-PA and P-selectin levels were significantly higher in CF patients. Endothelial perturbation (>2 SD increase in both vWF and t-PA) was present in 65% of CF patients. These patients displayed lower FEV1 values compared to individuals without endothelial perturbation and an inverse correlation between FEV1 and P-selectin levels was observed. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin (IL)-6 levels were also increased in CF patients and significant direct correlations were found between TNF-alpha and vWF, t-PA or P-selectin levels. These results indicate that CF patients exhibit signs of endothelial dysfunction/perturbation, which are likely to be related to a persistent inflammatory state due to chronic pulmonary infection, and may play a role in the progression of this disease.
