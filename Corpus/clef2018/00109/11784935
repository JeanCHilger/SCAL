Antibodies anti-Chlamydia pneumoniae and anti-Mycoplasma pneumoniae in patients with negative serology for hantavirus. Retrospective study. The seroprevalence of Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in hantavirus seronegative patients, who had symptoms and signs compatible with pneumonia was established. For this purpose we used the indirect fluorescent antibody test. Titers > or = 1:16 for C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae were found in 8.6% and 17.1% of the serum, respectively, showing evidence of recent or current infection.
