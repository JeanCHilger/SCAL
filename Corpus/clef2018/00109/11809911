Aerosolized perfluorocarbon suppresses early pulmonary inflammatory response in a surfactant-depleted piglet model. The effect of new ventilation strategies on initial pulmonary inflammatory reaction was studied in a surfactant-depleted piglet model. Sixty minutes after induction of lung injury by bronchoalveolar lavage, piglets received either aerosolized FC77 (aerosol-PFC, 10 mL/kg/h, n = 5) or partial liquid ventilation (PLV) with FC77 at functional residual capacity volume (FRC-PLV, 30 mL/kg, n = 5), or at low volume (LV-PLV, 10 mL/kg per hour, n = 5), or intermittent mandatory ventilation (control, n = 5). After 2 h, perfluorocarbon application was stopped and intermittent mandatory ventilation continued for 6 h. After a total experimental period of 8 h, animals were killed and lung tissue obtained. mRNA expression of IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and TGF-beta in porcine lung tissue was quantified using TaqMan real-time PCR and normalized to beta-actin (A) and hypoxanthine-guanine-phosphoribosyl-transferase (H). In the aerosol-PFC group, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta mRNA expression in lung tissue was significantly lower than in the control group. Reduction was 95% for IL-1beta/H (p < 0.001), 73% for IL-6/H (p < 0.05), 87% for IL-8/H (p < 0.001), and 38% for TGF-beta/H (p < 0.01). A lower mRNA gene expression was also determined for IL-1beta and IL-8 when the aerosol-PFC group was compared with the LV-PLV group [91% for IL-1beta/H (p < 0.001), 75% for IL-8/H (p < 0.001)]. In the FRC-PLV group, mRNA expression of IL-1beta was significantly lower than in the control (p < 0.05) and LV-PLV (p < 0.01) group. In a surfactant-depleted piglet model, aerosol therapy with perfluorocarbon but not LV-PLV reduces the initial pulmonary inflammatory reaction at least as potently as PLV at FRC volume.
