Amphotericin B lipid complex for Hansenula anomala pneumonia. To document the first successful treatment of a patient with Hansenula anomala pneumonia.A healthy 32-year-old white man who underwent splenectomy and aortic repair following a motor vehicle accident developed a life-threatening infection 2 days after admission into the intensive care unit (ICU). A rare fungus, H. anomala, was isolated from his lungs, blood, and urine. Lipid complex amphotericin B (ABLC) was initiated following worsening signs of infection complicated by renal failure. The patient received ABLC for 17 days, eventually making a full recovery, allowing ICU discharge 1 month after admission.This case represents the first successful treatment of H. anomala pneumonia reported in the literature. H. anomala infections typically occur in immunocompromised, neonatal, or pediatric populations in extrapulmonary sites. All 6 cases of H. anomala pneumonia reported in the literature were fatal, and all preceded the availability of ABLC. This case of H. anomala pneumonia is unique because our adult patient survived possibly due to the availability of aggressive treatment.ABLC may be the agent of choice for treatment of H. anomala infections, particularly in patients with acute renal failure.
