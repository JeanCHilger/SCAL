Perinatal cytomegalovirus infection complicated with pneumonitis and adrenalitis in a premature infant. Cytomegalovirus causes pneumonia, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, and hemolytic anemia. Cytomegalovirus adrenalitis in premature infants, however, is rare. This report described a premature newborn who had progressively worsening hyperbilirubinemia, pancytopenia, and hepatosplenomegaly at the age of 4 days. The baby's mother had prolonged rupture of amniotic membrane for about 8 weeks. The infant received exchange blood transfusion, empiric antibiotics treatment, and mechanical ventilation. Pneumonia and sepsis developed at the age of 18 days. Serum anticytomegalovirus immunoglobulin M and urine virus culture were positive for cytomegalovirus. The baby died at the age of 22 days. Autopsy showed cytomegalovirus infection complicated with interstitial pneumonitis and pulmonary edema, subacute bronchopulmonary dysplasia with interstitial fibrosis, and adrenalitis. We concluded that the functional status of the adrenal glands in cytomegalovirus-infected premature newborns who have unexplained electrolytes imbalance, fever, diarrhea, weight loss, or hypotension should be closely followed because of the possible involvement of adrenal glands.
