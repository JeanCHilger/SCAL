Nosocomial pneumonia in pediatric patients: practical problems and rational solutions. Nosocomial pneumonia is a common hospital-acquired infection in children, and is often fatal. Risk factors for nosocomial pneumonia include admission to an intensive care unit, intubation, burns, surgery, and underlying chronic illness. Viruses, predominantly respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), are the most common cause of pediatric nosocomial respiratory tract infections. Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) are the predominant bacterial pathogens, and are associated with a high mortality rate. Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis are the most common Gram-positive bacteria causing nosocomial pneumonia infections with these organisms have a better outcome than those with Gram-negative organisms. An increasing problem is the emergence of multiresistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative nosocomial pathogens. Distinguishing nosocomial pneumonia from other pulmonary processes may be difficult
