A septicopyemic form of the disease was noted in 33 subjects, local-focal in 19. The symptomatics and an early topic diagnosis depending on a stage of the process are described in detail. The treatment includes timely surgical intervention on the pathological focus, intensive genaxis and treatment of pathological dislocation of the femur.
