Community-acquired pneumonia associated with influenza virus. Pneumonia is one of the most common complications of influenza infection. However, its characteristics are not well-known. Our aim was to assess the frequency of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) associated with influenza virus and to determine its clinical and epidemiological characteristics.A total of 240 patients with CAP were evaluated and cases with serological evidence of influenza virus infection were identified. Patients in whom there was no evidence of infection by other microbial agents were selected and defined as influenza virus infection-associated CAP (CAP-i). Clinical and epidemiological features of CAP-i patients were compared with the rest of patients with CAP.A microbial diagnosis was achieved in 143 (59.6%) of 240 patients with CAP. In 12 cases (5%) there was serological evidence of infection by influenza A virus. In 8 patients no other respiratory pathogens were detected (CAP-i). In a multivariate analysis, the presence of arthromyalgias (odds ratio [OR] = 30, 68 95% confidence interval [CI], 1-946), plasmatic sodium < 133 mEq/l (OR = 16.92Influenza virus infection-associated CAP is uncommon. Some clinical and radiographic variables could differentiate CAP-i from other CAP. These parameters could also help identify patients who are more likely to benefit from specific antiviral therapy.
