An 8-y-old boy with acute stroke and radiological signs of cerebral vasculitis after recent Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. A young boy was admitted to hospital for acute stroke. Cerebral angiography showed a pattern suggestive of vasculitis and a recent Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was detected. The absence of microorganisms in cerebrospinal fluid, the pattern of vasculitis and previous reports supporting a post-infectious immunological mechanism for certain complications of M. pneumoniae infection suggest this mechanism as the cause of the stroke.
