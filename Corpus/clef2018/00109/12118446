Bronchial adenoma presenting with chronic asthma and obstructive pneumonia: a case report. A rare case of primary pulmonary neoplasm is reported. The patient was a 38-year-old woman presenting with obstructive pneumonia. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy revealed an endobronchial mass obstructing the left main bronchus: a reddish polypoid mass which bled on contract that was suggestive of bronchial adenoma. The patient also had a long-standing history of bronchial asthma and hemoptysis and the delay in establishing the eventured diagnosis was caused by the minor symptoms mimicking those of asthma. A persistent restrictive lung and the presentation of obstructive pneumonia were important clues which warranted further investigation by computed tomography (CT) scan and bronchoscopy. The patient underwent rigid bronchoscopy with CO2-laser ablation under general anesthesia. Histopathology confirmed a bronchial adenoma. The clinical response was excellent. Bronchial adenoma should be considered in young patients presenting with asthma, hemoptysis and obstructive pneumonia. Bronchoscopic CO2-laser ablation is an effective treatment and provides an alternative to aggressive thoracotomy.
