Severe multiorgan psittacosis in a 10-year-old boy. Psittacosis is rare among children and severe cases appear exceptional. We describe a child with psittacosis and multiorgan involvement.T., a ten-year-old boy, was admitted for a prolonged fever associated with meningism. Laboratory tests showed an important inflammatory response, mild renal failure and coagulation disorders. On admission, the chest X-Ray and the cerebrospinal fluid were normal. He rapidly developed shock, acute abdomen, oxygenodependency, pneumonia and bilateral pleural effusion. No improvement was observed after 48 hours of cefotaxime therapy. History revealed the presence of two parrots at home. Treatment by intravenous clarithromycin was therefore initiated. Serology for Chlamydia psittaci was strongly positive. All symptoms disappeared a few days later.The case reported was particular for two reasons: severe disease with multi-organ involvement and young age of the patient. We emphasize the need to search for a history of contact with birds in any case of unexplained pneumonia.
