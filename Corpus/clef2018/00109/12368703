Unusual encephalopathy after acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease: acute necrotizing encephalitis. Stroke is the most common neurologic complication of sickle cell disease. Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is a known risk factor for stroke in this population. Two patients (a 12-year-old boy and a 6-year-old girl) developed acute change of mental status and focal neurologic signs during episodes of ACS. The clinical and radiologic findings were compatible with acute necrotizing encephalitis, a variant of acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis. Patients with acute neurologic deterioration in conjunction with ACS should be evaluated thoroughly for other causes of central nervous system disease including infectious/parainfectious processes as well as stroke.
