Pneumonia associated with measles. Thirty-three children were hospitalized for pneumonia associated with measles. Eight did not have rash but had serologic evidence of measles infection and an otherwise compatible clinical picture. Lung puncture and tracheal aspirations were performed on 21 of the patients. Mortality was 15.2% (five patients) and was not associated with the use of these procedures.
