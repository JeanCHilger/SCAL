The utilization of bronchoalveolar lavage in children. To investigate the clinical effect of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in children with atelectasis owing to pulmonary infection.We compared the preactive period in test group (87 cases) who were treated by BAL with control group (30 cases) who were treated by conventional drug.The result showed a shorter preactive period in test group than that of control group (P < 0.01). No significant difference of effect of treatment was found between this two groups (P > 0.05).Under directly visual metal bronchoscope, we can improve the ventilation function by eliminating the obstructions, and can fasten the absorption and recovery of the foci by using antibiotics locally. So BAL can obviously shorten the course of treatment. Due to the structure defect, using of BAL with fiber bronchoscope is restricted in children. However, metal bronchoscope under total anesthesia can provide a good operation condition which include a large ventilation cavity and a wider visual field, so it has high clinical value in children.
