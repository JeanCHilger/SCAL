Immunization predictors in rural adults under 65 years of age. The specific study goal was to identify predictors of influenza and pneumonia immunizations in rural adults 18 to 64 years of age in Appalachia. The survey data used were collected from 931 adults from eight rural counties as part of a larger study. Information collected included influenza and pneumonia vaccination status, demographic and insurance coverage information, and immunization-related knowledge and beliefs. Immunization rates were 41.3 percent for influenza and 19.9 percent for pneumonia. Logistic regression analysis indicated that perceived disease susceptibility, perceived benefit, perceived harm, and insurance coverage for immunizations were significant predictors of both types of immunization, with insurance coverage being the strongest predictor. The findings can be used in development of promotional campaigns for increasing immunizations in this underserved rural population.
