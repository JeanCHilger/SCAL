Respiratory manifestations of common variable immunodeficiency in adults. Sporadic common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is the most frequent cause of primary humoral immunodeficiency observed in adults. Respiratory complications occur frequently.Recurrent bacterial pneumonia and bronchial suppuration are the most frequent complications whilst reactive interstitial pneumonitis (lymphoid interstitial pneumonia and sarcoid-like granulomatosis) and pulmonary lymphoma involvement are rarer. Treatment is based on replacement infusions of gamma globulin (Ig-IV). Although treatment has been shown to reduce the frequency of pulmonary infections, respiratory complications are still responsible for one third of late mortality in CVID.Type and frequency of respiratory survey has to be defined, as well as the indication for other treatments than Ig-IV.Protein electrophoresis must be done in a young adult with recurrent low respiratory tract infections and/or diffuse bronchectasis. Hypogammaglobulinemia should result in immunological and hematological investigations which may help to the diagnosis of CVID and to the beginning of the adequate treatment.
