Acute transverse myelitis with urinary retention due to mycoplasma pneumoniae infection: a case report. We report a case of urinary retention complicated with acute transverse myelitis caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae. A 16-year-old man visited a clinic because of urinary retention, fever, muscle weakness and sensory disturbance of lower extremities. He was referred to our hospital for further examination. He was diagnosed with acute transverse myelitis due to M. pneumoniae infection based on cerebrospinal fluid examination, serum titer of antibody to M. pneumoniae and magnetic resonance imaging. He was treated with corticosteroids for acute myelitis. A urethral catheter was indwellt for urinary retention. His muscle strength and sensory of lower extremities improved after 2 months of treatment, and he was discharged from our hospital. However, since urinary frequency, urge incontinence and weak urinary stream persisted, he was referred to us for further examination. A pressure-flow study examination showed a decreased maximum urinary flow rate and the findings of detrusor sphincter dyssnergia. We diagnosed him with uninhibited bladder and detrusor sphincter dyssnergia. We administered propiverine hydrochloride and imipramine hydrochloride, and his symptoms subsided significantly. Now, (8 months) after this medication, he still has incontinence at night.
