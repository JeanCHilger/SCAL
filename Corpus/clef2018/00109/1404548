Pulmonary zygomycosis: a radiographic and clinical spectrum. Eight documented cases of pulmonary zygomycosis were analyzed retrospectively with regard to radiographic and clinical features. Predisposing factors were diabetes mellitus in six cases, lymphoblastic lymphoma in one case, and surgery to correct a tracheoesophageal fistula in one case. Two of the patients with diabetes had also undergone renal transplantation for diabetic nephropathy and were immunosuppressed. The more usual radiographic findings of pulmonary zygomycosis represent a spectrum that comprises a normal chest radiograph, a lung abscess, subacute or chronic pneumonia that often evolves into a lung abscess, and rapidly progressive fatal pneumonia. Awareness of the various presentations of pulmonary zygomycosis is important because early diagnosis and appropriate therapy clearly have been shown to improve the survival rate of these patients. Zygomycosis should be included in the differential diagnosis when patients with diabetes mellitus, patients with leukemia or lymphoma, or immunocompromised patients present with or develop perplexing pulmonary abnormalities.
