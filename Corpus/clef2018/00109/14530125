Seroprevalence of the human cytomegalovirus among blood donors and AIDS patients in Bamako. Our aim was to study the prevalence of the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) among blood donors and AIDS patients and to examine a clinical correlation between AIDS and HCMV seroprevalence in Bamako (Mali, West Africa). We have used Elisa kits for detecting HIV and HCMV specific antibodies. The HCMV seroprevalence was 89% among AIDS patients, 71% among HIV-infected blood donors and 58% among HIV-uninfected blood donors. The HCMV seroprevalence rate was higher among AIDS patients than among HIV-uninfected blood donors (p=0.0000007) and than among HIV-infected blood donors (p=0.00146). There was no significant difference between the HCMV seroprevalence among HIV-infected blood donors and among HIV-uninfected blood donors (p=0.0547). There was no relationship between HCMV seroprevalence and sex or age among AIDS patients and blood donors. There was a significant difference on pneumonia among HCMV-infected AIDS patients and among HCMV-uninfected AIDS patients (40% versus 0% p=0.005). Buccal and phaiyngal candidosis, dermatosis, Kaposi's sarcoma and nervous system diseases had the same frequency among HCMV-infected and HCMV-uninfected AIDS patients.
