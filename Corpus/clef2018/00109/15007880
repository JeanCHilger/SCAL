Clinical efficacy of oral clarithromycin monotherapy in patients with mild or moderate community-acquired pneumonia. Clarithromycin (CAM) is a new macrolide antibiotic which is active against a wide range of organisms responsible for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and has superior pharmacokinetics and tolerance compared to erythromycin. In this study, we evaluated the clinical efficacy and antimicrobial activity of CAM in the empirical treatment of patients with CAP. CAM (200 mg given twice daily for 2 weeks) was orally administered to 26 patients with mild or moderate suspected atypical pneumonia, including 15 patients in whom treatment with beta-lactam antibiotics was largely ineffective. Causative pathogens were identified on the basis of quantitative sputum cultures, blood cultures, and routine serological testings M. pneumoniae was most commonly observed in patients with CAP (38.5%
