Pneumonia and pneumonitis in childhood malignancy. We conducted a survey over a 21-year period of the incidence and risk of occurrence of episodes of pneumonia and pneumonitis in children treated for solid tumours and leukaemia. One hundred episodes occurred amongst 219 patients, seven of which were associated with death. Focal opacification on the chest radiograph was more common than diffuse opacification. Patients with leukaemia had a significantly higher rate of occurrence of pneumonia and pneumonitis during the periods of induction and maintenance compared with the off-treatment period, and during the relapse period compared with the period of maintenance. Patients with solid tumours had a significantly higher rate of occurrence during treatment compared to the off-treatment period. The rate of occurrence on treatment was the same in patients with solid tumours and acute leukaemia. Children with malignancy have a high incidence of pneumonia and pneumonitis and death is rare if the patient does not have terminal malignant disease.
