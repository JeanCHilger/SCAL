Diagnostic utility and clinical significance of naso- and oropharyngeal samples used in a PCR assay to diagnose Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in children with community-acquired pneumonia. PCR assays of naso- and oropharyngeal samples among hospitalized children appear equally effective for the diagnosis of serologically confirmed community-acquired mycoplasmal pneumonia. However, the combination of results from both sites yields optimal sensitivity (57%), specificity (98%), and positive (92%) and negative (82%) predictive values when compared with Mycoplasma pneumoniae enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
