Can chest X-ray predict pneumonia severity? Predictors of the severity of pneumonia have not been thoroughly evaluated among children in developed countries. We investigate whether chest radiographic findings could be used as predictors of severity of childhood pneumonia. The study included 167 children, aged more than 12 months, hospitalized in our department during a 4-year period with unilateral lobar or segmental pneumonia. The durations of fever and of hospitalization were considered indicators of severity of the disease. The size of the consolidation and its location in the left hemithorax were independently associated with severity of the disease. Univariate analysis showed that the mean duration of fever and of hospitalization as well as the prevalence of pleural effusion was significantly higher among children with left-sided pneumonia. A multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that only the presence of pleural effusion was significantly more likely in left-sided pneumonia (odds ratio, 2.65 95% confidence interval, 1.09-6.47
