Etiology of atypical pneumonias in 2002. Results of the Croatian Institute of Public Health. This investigation was performed at Department of Virology, Croatian National Institute of Public Health, the same diagnostic laboratory using the same serologic method as in earlier studies (in 1982 and 1992) to determine the incidence of the most common agents of atypical pneumonia in Croatia between January 1 and December 31, 2002.The study included 630 patients from nearly all regions of Croatia with a clinical diagnosis of atypical pneumonia based on epidemiologic data, clinical symptoms, laboratory findings and chest X-rays. Most of them were from Zagreb (n = 370), followed by those from Slavonia, Istria, northwest Croatia, and Dalmatia. In all of them paired sera were collected at an interval of two weeks or more and tested for complement-fixing (CF) antibodies against the most common causative agents of the atypical pneumonia syndrome using CF test (micromethod).An etiologic diagnosis was established in 25% (158/630) patients (81 male and 77 female). Respiratory viruses were the most frequently demonstrated pathogens in 2002, accounting for 72% of cases (adenoviruses 47%, parainfluenza viruses 14%, influenza viruses 9% and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) 2%). These were followed by Chlamydophila (C.) psittaci (19%), Mycoplasma (M.) pneumoniae
