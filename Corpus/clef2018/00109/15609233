Dual infections of the central nervous system with Epstein-Barr virus. We describe clinical and laboratory characteristics of 16 patients with central nervous system (CNS) infection caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and another pathogen. Seven of 10 immunocompromised patients had coinfection with viruses (3 with cytomegalovirus, 2 with JC virus, and 2 with varicella zoster virus) and 3 with nonviral pathogens (2 with pneumococcus and 1 with Cryptococcus species). Three of 6 immunocompetent patients had coinfections with viruses (1 each with herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, and West Nile virus), and 3 had coinfections with nonviral pathogens (2 with Ehrlichia chaffeensis and 1 with Mycoplasma pneumoniae). The EBV load was similar in immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients and in patients with viral and nonviral coinfections. EBV lytic-cycle mRNA was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of 5 of 6 tested samples, indicating EBV replication in the CNS during coinfection.
