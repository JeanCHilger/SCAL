Long-term follow-up of an adolescent who had bilateral striatal necrosis secondary to Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. We describe the long-term follow-up of a patient with bilateral striatal necrosis associated with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection occurred in adolescence. In the literature there are no longitudinal studies of such a rare condition. Our patient, 4 years after the onset of an acute and reversible akinetic-rigid syndrome, showed a severe obsessive-compulsive disorder, cognitive decline, and a neuropsychological profile characterized by signs of deficient executive functioning. The clinical picture that emerged in our patient is suggestive of a frontosubcortical dementia which might be considered a major long-term sequela of the bilateral selective striatal necrosis and consequent dysfunction of frontostriatal connections.
