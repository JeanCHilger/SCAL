Acute cardiovascular complications due to physical exercise in male teenagers. Five sudden cardiac deaths in male adolescents (age 14-18 years) were detected in a 5-year period in Croatia. Two of them had been engaged in physical exercise at school, one as a professional soccer player, one in recreational swimming, and the fifth had just finished secondary school and was working at the site. All of them were autopsied and in three congenital cardiovascular diseases was found. Two had hypoplastic coronary arteries. The third had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with interventricular wall of 40 mm. The fourth had normal heart findings including coronaries, but had bilateral pneumonia with a possible altitude (non-cardiogenic) pulmonary edema. The fifth had a chronic myopericarditis with an aneurysm of the left ventricle. All of them had not reported definite symptoms at exertion. According to this data, the death rate in adolescent males in Croatia during or after recreational physical exercise was 1/100,000 per year or 5/500,000 in five years. Thorough preparticipation medical examination including indicated laboratory tests and avoidance of heavy exertion at the time of respiratory infection might have helped to avoid some of the lethal events.
