Radiologic findings in newborns with group B streptococcal septicemia: clinical importance of heart size and lung manifestations (author's transl). Chest radiographs of thirteen neonates with group B streptococcal septicemia were evaluated for signs of early diagnosis. Six of the neonates had chest radiographs as seen in idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Seven patients had radiologic findings consistent with neonatal pneumonia. The children with RDS were in general smaller and born prematurelly, but three neonates with x-rays resembling RDS had normal birth weights and thus were mature. Cardiomegaly was observed in a high percentage with a prevalence in children with RDS. Heart size increased in two of the three children who died, but became normal in patients recovering from infection. Three patients had pleural effusions.
