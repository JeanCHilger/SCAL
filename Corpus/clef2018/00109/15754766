The role of humoral markers of inflammation activity in the evaluation of adequacy of antibacterial chemotherapy for community-acquired pneumonia. To determine the significance of results of dynamic study of C-reactive protein (C-RP) and ceruloplasmin (CP) concentrations in plasma for evaluation of adequacy of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) launching antibacterial chemotherapy we investigated 97 patients (servicemen on draft). C-RP and CP were determined by immunoturbidimetric method. The blood samples were obtained on admission, on the 3rd-4th day of treatment and on the 7th-8th day of stay in the hospital. The transformations of pulmonary infiltrates were evaluated at the same periods with the use of digital chest fluorography. The strong correlation between transformations of pulmonary infiltrates for serum C-RP level (r=0.79) and CP level (r=0.71) was observed. The dynamic assessment of C-RP and CP levels is a simple and reliable test that permits to use it as an adjunctive procedure in C-RP diagnosis and evaluation of treatment effectiveness. The serum CRP level more than 110 mg/l and CP level higher than 6.3 mg/l should be considered as diagnostic and prognostic markers of severe CAP.
