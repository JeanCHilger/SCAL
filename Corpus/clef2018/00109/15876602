Multiple hypoechoic lesions in spleen and Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. An 8-year-old boy was admitted because of recurrent fever for 1 month with increased CRP and ESR. Ultrasound reviewed multiple, small, hypo-echoic, rounded and wedge-shaped nodules with diffuse blood flow in spleen and enlarged abdominal lymph nodes. The spleen was enlarged and no echoic space was found in the largest lesion on 5th day. After a positive mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) IgM was reported on 6th day, azithromycin was used intravenously. The temperature returned to normal and CRP and ESR improved in a short period. The lesions and lymphadenopathy disappeared and MP IgM antibody became negative 6 months later.
