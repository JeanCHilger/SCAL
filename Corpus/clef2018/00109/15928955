Genetic polymorphisms in the cytochromes P-450 (1A1, 2E1), microsomal epoxide hydrolase and glutathione S-transferase M1, T1, and P1 genes, and their relationship with chronic bronchitis and relapsing pneumonia in children. The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible roles of the genes functioning in xenobiotic metabolism and antioxidant pathways in the development of severe chronic lung disease in children. Polymorphisms in the genes encoding CYP1A1, CYP2E1, EPHX1, GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1 were investigated in cases of Tatar children with chronic bronchitis (n=129) and relapsing pneumonia (n=50) and in cases of ethnically matched healthy individuals (n=227) living in the city of Ufa, the Republic of Bashkortostan (South Ural region of Russia), by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RLFP) method. The frequency of the *2C allele of the CYP1A1 gene was significantly higher in patients than in the healthy control group (chi2=15.02, P=0.0007, Pcor=0.0021). This allele was associated with a higher risk of chronic bronchitis in children (OR 4.14, 95% CI 1.83-9.53 Pcor=0.0024). Similar results were obtained in cases of patients with relapsing pneumonia (OR 3.86, 95% CI 1.34-10.95
