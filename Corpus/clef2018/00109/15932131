Late presentation of congenital diaphragmatic hernia. A boy aged 6 months and a girl aged 9 months were admitted due to vomiting, among others, and a boy aged 11 months due to pneumonia. It turned out that they had a congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Primary operative repair was performed successfully in all patients, followed by recovery. The older boy experienced a relapse nearly 1 year later, which was treated by surgical correction. Most congenital diaphragmatic hernias present directly after birth, with cyanosis and respiratory distress. However, 10-20% of the cases are discovered after this period. In these children diagnosis can be difficult because of the diverse symptoms such as vomiting, feeding difficulties, tachypnoea or recurrent respiratory tract infections. Physical signs include the absence of breath sounds or the presence of bowel sounds in the chest. Chest X-ray, contrast upper gastrointestinal series or ultrasound imaging confirms the diagnosis. Delay in treatment can lead to complications such as necrosis of the bowel. In young children with acute or chronic respiratory infections or gastrointestinal complaints, a congenital diaphragmatic defect should be considered.
