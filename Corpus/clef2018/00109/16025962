Myocardial protective effect of puerarin injection in children with severe pneumonia. To investigate the myocardial protective effect of puerarin injection (PI) in children with severe pneumonia.One hundred children with pneumonia enrolled were divided into two groups according to their condition of illness. Forty-eight children of mild condition in the common group (CG) were treated with conventional treatment and 52 children of serious condition in the severe group (SG) were treated with conventional treatment with additional PI or fructose-1,6-disphosphate (FDP) for myocardial protection. The parameters of serum myocardial zymogram, ECG and cardiac blood flow were measured and the effects of PI and FDP in patients of serious condition were compared.Change of serum myocardial zymographic parameters was indirectly proportional to the severity of childrens condition. The reduction of myocardial contractive function was demonstrated by the change of cardiac blood flow parameters in Ultrasound Doppler examination (P < 0.01). Both PI and FDP had the effect in protecting myocardium and improving heart function, showing insignificant difference between their efficacy (P > 0.05), but PI had less stimulation to vessels and without any obvious adverse reaction.Severe pneumonia in children can lead to myocardial damage and heart failure, and early applying of myocardial protective measure can significantly improve the prognosis of patient. Myocardial zymographic parameters, especially the CK-MB, are sensitive and important indexes for detecting myocardial injury. PI has effects in protecting myocardium and improving heart function, and therefore, is suitable for spreading and applying in clinical practice.
