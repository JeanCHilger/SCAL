The protean manifestations of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in adults. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a well recognized respiratory pathogen in children and young adults. In addition, M. pneumoniae infections may also involve other organ systems. Reviewed here are the various clinical syndromes in adults caused by this infectious agent, with emphasis on those which have recently been seen at The New York Hospital. Two previously unreported manifestations of M. pneumoniae infection, cranial nerve mononeuropathy and hepatitis, are described, and the laboratory methods for diagnosis are discussed.
