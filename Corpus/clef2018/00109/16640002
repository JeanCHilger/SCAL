Chlamydia trachomatis pneumonia: experience in a medical center. Chlamydia trachomatis is one of the important causes of afebrile pneumonia in infants. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the demographic features, clinical manifestations, and outcome of C. trachomatis pneumonia patients seen during the past 10 years in one medical center. We reviewed the records on 30 patients with a diagnosis of C. trachomatis pneumonia. The diagnosis was based on characteristic clinical features and confirmed by culture, serologic testing, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Clinical features including age, sex, symptoms at the time of admission, laboratory data, and treatment were analyzed. Of the 30 patients (17 males and 13 females), 29 (96%) were less than 4 months old (range 10 days to 5 months). All patients had productive cough followed by tachypnea. Three patients (10%) presented with apnea. Four (13%) had conjunctivitis. Fever was present in only 3 (10%), of whom 2 also had concurrent respiratory syncytial virus infection. Peripheral eosinophilia (eosinophils > or = 400/mm3) was present in 14 (47%) patients. Hyperinflation was seen on chest x-ray in 15 patients. All infants were treated with erythromycin and responded well. The mean time to clinical improvement was 3.53 days after the start of treatment. The mean duration of hospitalization was 8.97 days (range, 3 to 17 days). No patients died. Pediatricians and general practitioners must have a high index of suspicion for chlamydial infection in afebrile infants presenting with tachypnea, peripheral eosinophilia, and hyperinflation on chest x- ray during the first four months of life.
