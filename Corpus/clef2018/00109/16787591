Levels of serum brain natriuretic peptide in children with congestive heart failure or with severe pneumonia. Some research has shown that B-type brain natriuretic peptide (BNF) is helpful in differentiating cardiac from pulmonary etiologies of dyspnea in adults. This study was designed to investigate whether BNP concentration could be similarly applied in children presenting with dyspnea.Blood samples were collected from 65 children presenting with dyspnea, due to congestive heart failure (CHF, n=24), pneumonia (n=23) or pneumonia together with CHF (n=18). The samples from 15 healthy children were used as the controls. There were no significant differences in age among the four groups. Serum BNP levels were measured using ELISA.Serum BNP levels in the CHF group (141.55 +/- 75.99 pg/mL) were significantly higher than those in the Pneumonia group (26.00 +/- 14.57 pg/mL P < 0.01), and the Pneumonia together with CHF group (113.73 +/- 87.05 pg/mLBNP level is of value in differentiating cardiac from pulmonary causes of dyspnea in children. BNP level is also helpful in assessing whether or not severe pneumonia couples with heart failure in children.
