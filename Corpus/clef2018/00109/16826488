Lack of association between the nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus in HIV-1-infected South African children. We investigated the nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus in 355 children hospitalized with severe pneumonia. Of the children, 239 (67.3%) were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 positive 169 (47.6%) carried S. pneumoniae, 91 (25.6%) carried S. aureus, and 33 (9.3%) carried both.
