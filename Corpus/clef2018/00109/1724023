Clinical-biochemical parallels in various methods of proteinase inhibitor kontrykal administration to patients with nonspecific lung diseases. Changes in clinical manifestations, activity of kinin blood system, serum alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor and proteinase-inhibitory system of bronchial lavage were evaluated in patients with acute pulmonary abscess in the presence of chronic bronchitis and lingering pneumonia treated locally (intrapulmonary and endobronchial administration) and conventionally with antibacterial and antiproteolytic drugs. Forty patients with acute pulmonary abscess and chronic bronchitis and 49 with the abscess and pneumonia received multimodality treatment including intrapulmonary and endobronchial introduction of antibiotics and contrykal. Thirty-five abscess patients with chronic bronchitis and 52 such with lingering pneumonia received intravenous droplet contrykal in identical day dose. Clinico-biochemical follow-up results were indicative of local contrykal advantages as the patients stayed in hospital for a shorter period, did not develop complications and chronic forms of nonspecific pulmonary diseases.
