Evaluation of 35 adult measles cases detected in a measles outbreak. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical, epidemiological and demographical features of adult measles cases admitted to our hospital, during the measles epidemic which emerged in Europe and in our country in the year 2001. A total of 35 adult measles cases (10 male, 25 female) ages between 16-36 (mean age: 23.1 +/- 4.6) years were detected between January and June 2001. The diagnosis was based on the clinical findings, however only 11 of the cases could be serologically confirmed with the presence of measles IgM antibody positivities. Fever (91.4%), cough (94.3%) and conjunctivitis (77.1%) were the most common symptoms. All of the patients had maculopapular rash, and the presence of Koplik spots, lymphadenopathy and hepatomegaly were observed in 77.1%, 57.1%, and 5.7% of patients, respectively. Leukopenia and elevated liver enzymes were detected in 28.5% and 37.2% of the patients, respectively. Pneumonia was the most common complication which was seen in 20% of the patients. Of the cases 2.9% exhibited otitis media and 17.1% diarrhea. Spontaneous abortus occurred in one of the three pregnant women. In conclusion, measles is still an important public health problem in our country, and since it may lead to severe complications and economic and labor loss, an effective elimination programme should be obtained by the use of vaccine in two doses and effective strategies for the immunization of the target populations.
