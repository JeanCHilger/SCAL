H-type congenital tracheoesophageal fistula: University Of Iowa experience 1985 to 2005. We review the diagnostic workup, associated disorders, surgical technique, and postoperative course of patients who underwent repair of H-type tracheoesophageal fistulas.We performed a retrospective chart review of patients who received a diagnosis of tracheoesophageal fistula at the University of Iowa.Seven patients with an H-type tracheoesophageal fistula and a single patient with a missed proximal fistula associated with esophageal atresia were identified. Their symptoms included coughing with feeding, recurrent pneumonia, and episodic cyanosis. A delay in diagnosis was seen in 4 patients and ranged from 2.5 months to 5.9 years. In all patients, the diagnosis was made with an esophagogram. The level of the fistulas was between C5 and T3, and all were successfully repaired via a right cervical approach.A high index of suspicion for an H-type tracheoesophageal fistula should be maintained in the presence of neonatal respiratory symptoms, as the condition can be associated with a delay in diagnosis. Repeat esophagograms and bronchoscopy may be required for diagnosis. In the postoperative period, airway obstruction is a potential risk however, long-term difficulty with swallowing, respiration, and phonation was not observed.
