Does vitamin E prevent gentamicin-induced ototoxicity? A randomized double-blind study was performed to check the protective efficacy of vitamin E against aminoglycoside ototoxicity. 52 patients scheduled for gentamicin therapy because of acute pulmonary infections have been tested. Volunteers were randomly assigned to receive additionally either vitamin E or placebo. The daily dosage of gentamicin amounted to 240 mg and that of vitamin E to 2800 mg. The treatment lasted 7 days. Hearing function was assessed before the start of medication and at the follow-up visit 6 to 8 weeks afterwards. Elevation of auditory thresholds occurred in similar number of patients in the vitamin-E and placebo groups and no statistically significant differences were found between. Vitamin E has been not confirmed thus to possess any protective action against gentamicin-induced ototoxicity.
