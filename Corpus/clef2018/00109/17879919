Palivizumab treatment of respiratory syncytial virus infection after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Among 40 allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients who developed symptomatic respiratory syncytial virus infection, including 22 patients with lower respiratory tract infection, 19 received palivizumab (9 of whom had upper respiratory tract disease). Palivizumab did not prevent progression to lower respiratory infection and had no impact on the overall survival rate.
