Medium-weight molecules and their indicator role in young children with acute pneumonia. As many as 63 infants with acute pneumonia, 7 children with ARVI (bronchiolitis) and 28 normal children were examined. At the height of the clinical manifestations there was an increase of the level of medium-weight molecules in blood serum, correlating well with the disease gravity determined by the intensity of the toxic syndrome. The highest concentration of serum medium-weight molecules was demonstrable in toxic and purulent complications due to acute pneumonia. Meanwhile the level of medium-weight molecules, equal to or exceeding 0.6 Units extinction may be viewed as an unfavourable predictor. No relationship was discovered between the concentration of serum medium-weight molecules and the type of virus causative agent and respiratory tract inflammation.
