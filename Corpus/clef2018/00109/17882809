Extrahospital pneumonias: the clinico-scintigraphic characterization and oxidative balance of cells. Ventilation-perfusion pulmonary scintigraphy was carried out in 30 patients with a verified diagnosis of extra-hospital pneumonia (EHP) and 10 healthy subjects ventilation-perfusion ratio (V/Q), apex-basis ventilation and perfusion gradient, and the condition of alveolar-capillary permeability (ACP) were analyzed. Clinical symptoms during the debut of EHP were more pronounced in patients with an alveolar type of pulmonary infiltrate (PI) vs. patients with interstitial one: they had pulmonary infiltration syndrome, pleural pain, tachypnoe, tachycardia, a fever of higher than 38 degrees C, and leucocytosis more often. During the acute period of EHP, elevated lipid peroxidation in the erythrocyte membrane as well as a decrease in the content of reduced glutathione and the activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase in erythrocytes did not depend on the type of PI. In EHP, independently of PI type, the study revealed an increase in V/Q of higher than 1.0 on the side of lesion and bilateral (including the healthy side) increase in ACP for radioactive aerosol.
