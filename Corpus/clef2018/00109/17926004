Co-infection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae and human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) in an immunocompetent child with meningoencephalitis: a random association? Encephalitis can represent a complication of both Mycoplasma and Human Herpesvirus type 6 infections and, although uncommon, is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We describe a 13-year-old girl with fever, headache and mental changes with a pattern of concomitant Mycoplasma and Human Herpesvirus-6 infection. The hypothetical relationship between this dual infection and the central nervous system disease is discussed.
