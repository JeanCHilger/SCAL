The character and structure of infectious complications in patients with chronic renal failure, who received or did not receive replacement therapy (hemodialysis). The subjects of the study were 176 patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) (101 men 75 women) aged 17 to 81. Stage I CRF was found in 46 patients, stage II CRF--in 69 patients, and stage III CRF--in 61 patients. Thirty-one patients with stage III CRF received program hemodialysis. Chronic glomerulonephritis was the main cause of CRF. With the progress of CRF, the frequency of infectious complications grew up to 2.2% in stage I, 7.2% in stage II, and 36.1% in stage III. The rate of infectious complications was higher in patients on program dialysis vs. patients without it: 51.6 and 20%, respectively. Pneumonia was the most frequent complication regardless CRF stage.
