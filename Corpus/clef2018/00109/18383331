Procoagulant activity in children with community acquired pneumonia, pleural effusion and empyema. In patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), bacterial-cell-wall-derived fragments may induce the coagulation cascade. To contribute to the knowledge of underlying mechanisms, we have studied the fibrinolytic activity in children with CAP and parapneumonic effusions.Twenty previously healthy children admitted to our Department with CAP were studied with (n = 11) or without (n = 9) pleural effusion (PPE). We also investigated 10 children with empyema. In all children we analyzed coagulation and fibrinolytic parameters and compared the results to nine controls.Prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) were not significantly modified in the three groups as compared to controls (P = 0.975, P = 0.535, respectively). The fibrinogen levels were significantly increased in respect to the control group (P < 0.0001). The median values of D-dimer showed an increasing trend that was statistically significant: children with pneumonia 244 microg/L, with pneumonia and PPE 751 microg/L and with empyema 2003 microg/L, in respect to values (48 microg/L) of our control group (P < 0.0001).The results suggest that plasma level of D-dimer can give an additional contribution for the evaluation of the severity of CAP and its complications in children.
