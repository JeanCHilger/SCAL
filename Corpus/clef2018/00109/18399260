Concurrent tonsillitis and pneumonia due to S. pyogenes. Tonsillitis is a common disease especially of children and young adults. The diagnosis of tonsillitis generally requires the consideration of Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci infection. Pneumonia is an inflammation of the alveoli and terminal airspaces in response to invasion by an infectious agent that is introduced into the lungs through hematogenous spread or inhalation. We present a case of a concurrent acute tonsillitis and pneumonia due to S. pyogenes. To our knowledge, a similar case has not been previously described in the literature.
