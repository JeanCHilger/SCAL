Malignant pulmonary tumors in children. Pulmonary neoplasms in children are rare. The majority of tumors involving the respiratory system are metastatic and primary lung tumors are even more rare. Approximately 75% of primary lung tumors are malignant, the most frequent of which are adenoma, bronchogenic carcinoma, and pleuropulmonary blastoma. Due to the rarity of these malignancies, and the usually nonspecific clinical symptoms, they are often not considered in the differential diagnosis in children who present with persistent pneumonitis, coughing, and atelectasis. This often results in delayed definitive treatment and, in general, a worse prognosis. The role of the radiologist is that by using modern imaging techniques, to facilitate early recognition and staging, enabling adequate treatment and follow-up and thus, a better clinical prognosis. This article provides an overview of the most relevant entities of primary childhood pulmonary malignancies, with a particular emphasis on the imaging characteristics.
