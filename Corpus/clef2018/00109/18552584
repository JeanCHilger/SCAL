An unusual case of Lemierre's syndrome presenting as pyomyositis. Fusobacteria are most often associated with the classic presentation of Lemierre's syndrome consisting of a sore throat, internal jugular vein thrombophlebitis, and septic emboli to the lungs. Unusual presentations due to the causative organism, F. necrophorum, may occur. We present such a case involving a 17-year-old male patient with pyomyositis and fasciitis due to necrobacillosis. Fusobacterium spp. should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cases involving sepsis syndrome and pyomyositis.
