Streptococcus pneumoniae - caused CAP in hospitalised patients: mortality predictors. Probably the most important decision in the management of Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) is patient site of care. Patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae-caused CAP admitted to our hospital between 1st January and 31st December 2006 were retrospectively analysed. Samples of blood, sputum, bronchial and bronchoalveolar lavage and urine were collected for microbiological testing using standard culture techniques and urine antigen detection. Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) and British Thoracic Society (BTS) CURB-65 scoring tools were evaluated. The statistical treatment was performed using the SPSS 14.0 program. We included 104 patients, 67.3% male, median age 63 years old, mortality 13.4%. There was a significant association between the PSI and CURB-65 score and mortality. Despite advances, CAP is still an important health problem with a high attendant morbi-mortality. This study confirms the value of PSI and CURB-65 in the prediction of severe pneumonia.
