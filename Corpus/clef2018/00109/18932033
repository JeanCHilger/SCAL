Massive parapneumonic effusion caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae in a child: a case report. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection is usually mild course and self-limited. Parapneumonic effusion is not a common feature of M. pneumoniae. The treatment of parapneumonic effusion is macrolides and chest tube with adequate pleural drainage. We report here on a child with M. pneumoniae infection complicated by massive parapneumonic effusion. Protracted course of fever and respiratory distress was noted in patient. Pneumothorax was occurred subsequent to chest tube drainage.
