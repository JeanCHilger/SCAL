Relevance of serology for Mycoplasma pneumoniae diagnosis compared with PCR and culture in acute exacerbation of bronchial asthma. We studied Mycoplasma pneumoniae as the etiologic pathogen in acute exacerbations of asthma and the value of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), culture, and serologic tests for its accurate diagnosis. For the study, 59 nonsmoking patients with asthma (37 females, 22 males age, 15-50 years) underwent clinical, radiologic, and laboratory examinations. Bacteria isolated from sputum were Streptococcus pneumoniae (32 [54%]), Staphylococcus aureus (23 [39%]), and M pneumoniae (5 [15%]). All M pneumoniae were associated with S pneumoniae (8/32 [25%]) and S aureus (1/23 [4%]). No M pneumoniae were isolated as single pathogens. Serologic testing for M pneumoniae revealed that all samples were positive for specific IgG
