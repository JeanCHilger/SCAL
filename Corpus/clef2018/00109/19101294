Risks and predictors of blood transfusion in pediatric patients undergoing open heart operations. Blood transfusion in adults is associated with increased mortality and morbidity after cardiac operations. The aim of this study was to identify the main predictors of blood transfusion and explore the relationship between blood transfusion and adverse outcomes in a pediatric population.We retrospectively analyzed a prospectively collected database (January 2002 to December 2003) of 657 consecutive pediatric patients undergoing open heart procedures in a tertiary pediatric cardiac center. Risk models were calculated for each blood product and for the total amount of blood transfused during the operation and in the first 24 hours. Postoperative adverse events were investigated after propensity score adjustment.During the postoperative period, 30 patients (4.6%) died, 80 (12.2%) sustained nonvascular pulmonary complications, and 113 (17.2%) had infection. The risk model for the total amount of blood transfusion included weight, preoperative creatinine clearance, preoperative mechanical ventilation, duration of operation and cross-clamp, surgeon, delayed chest closure, inotropic dose, and nitric oxide administration. Univariate analyses demonstrated significant associations between blood transfusion and occurrence of every complication except of neurologic events. After adjustment for propensity score and disease severity, the total amount of blood transfusion was independently associated with an increased risk for infections (odds ratio, 1.01 95% confidence interval, 1.002 to 1.02The amount of blood transfusion is independently associated with infections but not with mortality.
