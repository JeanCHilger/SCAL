IL-1 mediates pulmonary and systemic inflammatory responses to chorioamnionitis induced by lipopolysaccharide. Chorioamnionitis frequently associates with preterm delivery and increased amniotic fluid IL-1, and causes fetal lung and systemic inflammation. However, chorioamnionitis is also associated with a paradoxical reduction in the incidence of surfactant deficiency-related respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants.To identify the role of IL-1 signaling in the mediation of pulmonary and systemic inflammation and lung maturation in a fetal sheep model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced chorioamnionitis.After confirming the efficacy of recombinant human IL-1 receptor antagonist (rhIL-1ra), fetal sheep were exposed to intraamniotic (IA) injections of Escherichia coli LPS with or without prior IA injections of rhIL-1ra. Preterm lambs were delivered at 82% of term gestation.rhIL-1ra decreased IA LPS-induced lung inflammation assessed by decreased lung neutrophil and monocyte influx, inducible nitric oxide synthase expression, lung IL-6 and IL-1beta mRNA expression, and airway myeloperoxidase concentrations. rhIL-1ra inhibited IA LPS-induced fetal systemic inflammation assessed by decreased plasma IL-8, protein carbonyls, blood neutrophilia, and the expression of serum amyloid A3 mRNA in the liver. rhIL-1ra also partially blocked the lung maturational effects of IA LPS. Therefore blockade of IL-1 signaling in the amniotic compartment inhibited fetal lung and systemic inflammation and lung maturation in response to LPS-induced chorioamnionitis.IL-1 plays a central role in the pathogenesis of chorioamnionitis-induced fetal inflammatory responses.
