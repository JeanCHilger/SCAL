Analysis of fatal outcomes issues of typhus fever. The nature and frequency of complications in patients with typhus fever are of importance for its outcome. The causes of death were studied in 126 patients who had died from this disease. The immediate causes of death were as follows: infectious-toxic shock (31.7%), pneumonia (28.6%), and perforative peritonitis (26.2%). The pathomorphism of Payer's patches does not allow the stages of the disease to be identified. An immunohistochemical study established a drastic preponderance of granulomatous macrophages without proliferation markers with a simultaneous reduction in the count of T and B lymphocytes and dendritic cells.
