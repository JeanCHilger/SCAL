Low prevalence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in children with acute pharyngitis. The aim of this study is to determine the role of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in pediatric patients with acute pharyngitis and in a healthy control group.Prospective study conducted April and June 2006 of children with acute pharyngitis. M. pneumoniae infection was determined by PCR in pharyngeal exudate specimens from these patients and a healthy control group.A total of 182 cases and 60 controls were enrolled. PCR for M. pneumoniae was positive in 7 cases (3.8%, 95% CI 1.5-7.7) and negative in all controls.The incidence of acute pharyngitis due to M. pneumoniae is low in our setting. In healthy patients (control group) all M. pneumoniae testing by PCR was negative therefore, the possible pathological significance of all cases of acute pharyngitis PCR-positive for M. pneumoniae should be evaluated.
