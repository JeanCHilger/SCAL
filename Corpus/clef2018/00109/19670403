Role of Chlamydophila pneumoniae in children hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia in Vienna, Austria. No recent Austrian data are available on the epidemiology and morbidity of Chlamydophila pneumoniae (C. pneumoniae) as causative agent in youths and children hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). These data would serve as a rationale for empiric antimicrobial therapy.During winter months 2006/7 112 immunocompetent youths and children between 2 months and 18 years hospitalized consecutively with CAP were prospectively enrolled. Microbiological detection of conventional bacteria, Mycoplasma pneumoniae as well as respiratory viruses was performed, and clinical signs as well as indices of inflammation were documented. Diagnosis of C. pneumoniae was performed by means of species-specific real-time PCR as well as cell culture from respiratory secretions.PCR for C. pneumoniae was performed in 60 patients. In 4 cases (6.7%) C. pneumoniae was found as causative agent. In 1 case C. pneumoniae could be confirmed by cell-culture. All children with C. pneumonia were > or =5 years of age. All but 1 child received clarithromycin together with cefuroxime. The number of days with fever >38,5 degrees C was between 1 and 7, the number of days in hospital was between 4 and 7, all children recovered completely.C. pneumoniae was found in 6.7% of children and youths hospitalized with CAP in a community hospital during the winter months 2006/07. Children and youths with lower respiratory infections should further be tested for C. pneumoniae to elucidate the actual epidemiological situation and to guide empiric antimicrobiotic therapy.
