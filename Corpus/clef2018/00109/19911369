Congenital rubella pneumonitis complicated by Pneumocystis jiroveci infection with positive long term respiratory outcome: a case report and literature review. Rubella remains to be a significant illness in the developing countries because of limited access to immunizations. In congenital rubella syndrome, lung involvement becomes evident within the few months of life, as a manifestation of the "late onset rubella syndrome." The lungs and other organs become involved secondary to immunopathologic mechanisms and immunodeficiency predisposes affected patients to opportunistic pathogens. We report the clinical, respiratory and immunologic data of a young boy who developed rubella pneumonitis and concomitant infection with Pneumocystis jiroveci. Despite the complicated clinical course, the child survived. At follow-up he has a normal pulmonary examination, mild hyperinflation only on his chest radiograph, normal immunology and normal respiratory reactance and resistance.
