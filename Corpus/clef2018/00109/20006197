ED antibiotic use for acute respiratory illnesses since pneumonia performance measure inception. The study aimed to determine if emergency department (ED)-administered antibiotics for patients discharged home with nonpneumonia acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) have increased since national pneumonia performance measure implementation, including antibiotic administration within 4 hours of arrival.Time series analysis.Six university and 7 Veterans Administration EDs participating in the Improving Antibiotic Use for Acute Care Treatment (IMPAACT) trial (randomized educational intervention to reduce antibiotics for bronchitis).Randomly selected adult (age >18 years) ED visits for acute cough, diagnosed with nonpneumonia ARIs, discharged home during winters (November-February) of 2003 to 2007.Time trend in ED-administered antibiotics, adjusted for patient demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, ED length of stay, IMPAACT intervention status, geographic region, Veterans Administration/university setting, and site and provider level clustering.Six thousand four hundred seventy-six met study criteria. Three hundred ninety-four (6.1%) received ED-administered antibiotics. Emergency department-administered antibiotics did not increase across the study period among all IMPAACT sites (odds ratio [OR], 0.88 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76-1.01) after adjusting for age, congestive heart failure history, temperature higher than 100 degrees F, heart rate more than 100, blood cultures obtained, diagnoses, and ED length of stay. The ED-administered antibiotic rate decreased at IMPAACT intervention (OR, 0.80Emergency department-administered antibiotics did not increase for patients with acute cough discharged home with nonpneumonia ARIs since pneumonia antibiotic timing performance measure implementation in these academic EDs.
