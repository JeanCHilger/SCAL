Pneumococcal pneumonia highly probable in immunized children cared for in-group settings. Invasive pneumococcal diseases were reduced after introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, but infections due to non-vaccine serotypes persisted. The pneumococcal origin of community-acquired pneumonia remains difficult to affirm, but high procalcitonin and C-reactive protein blood levels and duration of fever 48 h or less after initial antibiotic treatment are excellent predictors of pneumococci. Among 259 patients under 7 years of age hospitalized from 2003 to 2008 for community-acquired pneumonia, 47 met these criteria, including 27 of 141 hospitalized between 2006 (date of vaccine generalization) and 2008. Of these 27, 21 had previously received pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and 19 of 21 were attendees of nursery school or day care centers versus only 2 in 2003-2006. These data show that pneumococcal pneumonias are possible in immunized children cared for in-group settings.
