Communicating oesophageal duplication cyst with heterotopic pancreatic tissue - an unusual cause of recurrent pneumonia in an infant. Communicating oesophageal duplication cyst with heterotopic pancreatic tissue is rare congenital anomaly and unusual cause of recurrent pneumonia in children. We report a 10-month-old boy who presented with history, examination and investigations suggestive of aspiration pneumonia since birth. The imaging studies revealed a thin walled cavity communicating with the oesophageal lumen that was excised by surgery. Histopathology showed squamous epithelial lining of cyst with heterotopic pancreatic tissue.Communicating oesophageal cyst causing persistent signs and symptoms can be an unusual cause of recurrent pneumonia in an infant that can be diagnosed by further imaging studies.
