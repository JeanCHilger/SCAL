Epidemiological characteristics of Acinetobacter baumannii infections at Phramongkutklao Hospital. To describe epidemiological characteristics of Acinetobacter baumannii infections and identify molecular patterns of A. baumannii isolated from the patients admitted in Phramongkutklao Hospital.A retrospective study on previously isolated A. baumannii from the clinical specimens submitted to the microbiology laboratory of Phramongkutklao Hospital from January to March 2008 were carried out together with molecular typing using PCR-based method. Clinical data were obtained from IC surveillance and patients' records.114 A. baumannii were isolated from 80 patients. A. baumannii was a cause of healthcare-associated infection (90%, 72 of 80 cases), colonization (7.5%), and community-acquired infection (2.5%) with mortality rate of 50%. Majority of the patients from which A. baumannii were isolated were male (58.8%), age over 60 years (56.3%), diagnosed with lower respiratory diseases (26.3%), had A. baumannii ventilator-associated pneumonia (66.7%), and admitted in medical department (57.5%) with median length of hospital stay 35 days. PDR- and MDR- A. baumannii were accounted for 67.5% and 21.1%, respectively. All isolates showed sensitive to tigecycline and colistin. Using PCR-based typing was able to distinguish 6 molecular types among 114 A. baumannii isolates. Molecular type 2 was the most common type (47.4%) and widely spread in 14 wards. Spread of clonally related isolates was found in 14 cases admitted in 8 medical wards and ICUs.Multiple clones of PDR- and MDR- A. baumannii were widely spread in the hospital. Clonally related A. baumannii infected 14 cases in 8 wards.
