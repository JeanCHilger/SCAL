Updated principles and clinical caveats in the management of infection in renal transplant recipients. Renal transplantation is now considered the treatment of choice for patients with end-stage renal disease. In transplant recipients, infection and rejection are entwined and are unavoidable tribulations unless clinical tolerance becomes a reality. Although rejection rates have significantly decreased with the introduction of newer immunosuppressive agents, infections remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and the magnitude of the problem is on the rise. Newer infections are emerging and patterns of known infections are changing. The continuous evolution of donor and recipient characteristics also alters the landscape of infections. In clinical practice, establishing a definite diagnosis of infection in a timely manner remains a challenge in transplant recipients as compared to immunocompetent individuals. Hence a comprehensive knowledge of the principles of management of infections in renal transplant recipients is very essential. In this review, we would like to provide an overview of some of the key principles that we believe are essential in the management of infectious complications in renal transplant recipients with no focus on any individual infection.
