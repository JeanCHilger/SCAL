Effectiveness and safety of neuraminidase inhibitors in reducing influenza complications: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. Several studies suggest that neuraminidase inhibitors (NIs) can reduce the duration of influenza symptoms. However, data regarding their effectiveness in reducing influenza complications are scarce.We evaluated the effectiveness of NIs in reducing influenza complications and mortality of patients with seasonal influenza, by performing a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), retrieved from PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Scopus databases, comparing NIs with placebo.Eleven RCTs (10 double-blind) were included 8 involved adults/adolescents. In total, 5315 patients were includedNIs seem to be effective in reducing total influenza-related complications in otherwise healthy and high-risk patients, and have an acceptable safety profile. However, RCTs providing separate data for mild to serious complications and detailed reporting of adverse events and mortality are needed.
