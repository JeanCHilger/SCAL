Decreased Cyp2E1 mRNA expression in human leucocytes in patients with fibrotic and inflammatory lung diseases. Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), a phase I enzyme, is involved in the activation of a broad spectrum of pro-carcinogens. The importance of this enzyme for pharmacology is derived from its unique substrate spectrum. Large inter-individual differences in the toxicity of its substrates are known. We investigated the quantitative Cyp2E1 mRNA expression in a cohort of patients with fibrotic and inflammatory lung diseases (n=137) and healthy controls (n=221) considering tobacco-smoke, exposure to asbestos, silica, organic dust or chemical irritating particles in relation to the C1053T (RsaI) polymorphism of Cyp2E1. For quantitative comparison of Cyp2E1 mRNA levels real-time PCR was performed using a LightCycler System. Calculations of expression were made with the 2(-DeltaDeltaCT) method. Detection of the C1053T (RsaI) polymorphism of the Cyp2E1 gene was performed by rapid capillary PCR with melting curve analysis. Fibrotic (0.016+/-0.002 n=52
