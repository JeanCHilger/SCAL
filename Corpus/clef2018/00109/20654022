Balloon dilatation bronchoplasty in management of bronchial stenosis in children with mycoplasma pneumonia. To assess the efficacy and safety of balloon dilatation through flexible bronchoscopy in the management of inflammatory stenosis of grade 4-5 bronchus.Thirty patients with inflammatory bronchial stenosis caused by mycoplasmal pneumonia complicated with pulmonary atelectasis were treated with balloon dilatation through fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Before the procedure and after the last operation, therapeutic effect on pulmonary atelectasis were evaluated with CT and all of the patients were followed-up for 1 - 6 months.One to three operations were required to achieve satisfactory dilatation. After balloon dilatation, the average airway diameter increased obviously and the farther airways were opened after the therapy with irrigation. In 25 of 30 cases satisfactory immediate effects were obtained, a narrow airway diameter above expansion significantly increased as compared with preoperative diameter. In 5 children treated with balloon dilatation, the stenosis could not be improved significantly. In 3 patients with hyperplasia of granulation tissue, cryotherapy had to be applied. The operations were ineffective in the other two patients whose course of disease exceeded 3 months. After follow-up periods of 1 - 6 months, chest CT manifestation of expanded sites was improved in 28 patients and atelectasis disappeared. No severe complication was found in any patients.Bronchoplasty by balloon dilatation through flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy is a simple, effective and safe method to treat childhood tracheobronchial stenosis after pulmonary infections.
