Clinical evaluation of cefuzonam (CZON) for bacterial pneumonia and lung abscess: comparative study with cefotiam (CTM). A double blind study was conducted to objectively evaluate the usefulness of Cefuzonam (CZON) in the treatment of bacterial pneumonia and lung abscess. Cefotiam (CTM) was used as a control drug. Each drug was administered by intravenous drip infusion at 1 g at a time, twice daily, for 14 days as a rule. The results are as follows: 1. Enrolled in this study were 145 cases in total, comprising 72 of CZON group and 73 of CTM group. Of the total cases, 109 (53 of CZON group and 56 CTM group) were evaluated for clinical efficacy by the evaluation committee. Exclusion rate and background of patients were not significantly different between the two groups. 2. Clinical effectiveness assessed by the committee showed the efficacy rates of 84.9% (45 cases out of 53) for the CZON group and 83.3% (47 cases out of 56) for the CTM group, with no significant difference between the two groups. 3. The bacteriological eradication rates were 89.5% (17 strains out of 19) for the CZON group and 78.3% (18 strains out of 23) for the CTM group, with no significant difference between the two groups. 4. The incidence of side effects was 5 cases (7.5%) for the CZON group and 3 cases (4.2%) for the CTM group. The incidence rate of laboratory test abnormality was 28.4% (19 cases out of 67) for the CZON group and 31.3% (12 cases out of 67) for the CTM group. There was no significant difference between the two groups. 5. Usefulness rates calculated by the committee were 79.2% (42 cases out of 53) for the CZON group and 76.8% (43 cases out of 56) for the CTM group. There was no significant difference between the two groups. These results show that CZON is a useful drug in the treatment of bacterial pneumonia and lung abscess.
