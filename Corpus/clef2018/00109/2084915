Interrelation between the lipid composition of expirates and lung ventilation function in patients with acute pneumonia. A study was made of the lung surfactant (LS) according to the results of an analysis of neutral lipid fractions, examination of total phospholipids (PL) and surface tension (ST) in expirates (EX) of 127 patients with acute pneumonia (AP), 30 patients with acute bronchitis (AB) and in 77 healthy persons. As compared to the control and AB patients, AP patients demonstrated a significant increase in EX of the level of cholesterol (CS), esters of cholesterol (ECS), free fatty acids (FFA), PL, ST and a decrease of the content of tri- and diglycerides (TG, DG). Linear negative correlations were established between external respiration and CS, ECS, FFA, ST and positive ones between external respiration and TG and DG. Relations between ventilation and PL were of nonlinear character. Parameters that characterize the pulmonary volumes and capacities correlated most closely with some lipid fractions whereas parameters of bronchial patency had relations of medium and low intensity. It is concluded that destructive processes in the LS are likely to be coupled. The given processes are reflected in the rise of lipid fractions in EX, with ventilation function of the lungs being deranged in AP.
