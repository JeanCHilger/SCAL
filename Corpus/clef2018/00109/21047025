Adolescent pneumonia. Despite advances in antibiotic treatment and prevention, pneumonia, an acute infection of the pulmonary parenchyma, continues to have a significant impact on adolescent health. Mortality remains low, but pneumonia is associated with significant morbidity at considerable cost to our health care system. The first section of this article focuses on general principles of pneumonia in adolescents, including epidemiology, pathogenesis, etiology, clinical manifestations, radiography, laboratory evaluation, management, complications, and prevention. The final section covers individual pathogens associated with pneumonia in adolescents, including recent updates in diagnosis, management, and prevention of these agents.
