Branching defects and mucosal diverticulosis of the bronchi in children as factors predisposing to the development of chronic inflammatory processes in the lungs. Clinical and bronchographic data were juxtaposed with the results of selective histological examination of the resected parts of lungs from 3 to 14-year-old children suffering for several years from persistent cough and recurrent pneumonias. The defects of small and mean bronchi branching are found in 66% of cases (out of 50) and in 64% there was diverticulosis of the mucous membrane of large and small bronchi that is followed by pseudopoliposis and the development of deep "pouches". All this is followed by bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue hyperplasia, development of peribronchial pneumonia foci, chronic bronchitis, obturation syndrome.
