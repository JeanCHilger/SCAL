Palatal insufficiency as isolated sign of GQ1b antibody syndrome. Antiganglioside GQ1b antibodies mediate a continuum of disorders with overlapping features, fostering the concept of anti-GQ1b antibody syndrome. We present a patient whose palatal insufficiency was the only clinical sign of postinfectious GQ1b antibody syndrome. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging confirmed involvement of the glossopharyngeal nerve and vagus nerve bilaterally, revealing gadolinium enhancement of both nerves bilaterally and thickening of the left nervus vagus. Magnetic resonance imaging may help in diagnosing postinfectious GQ1b antibody syndrome, especially at early stages and in monosymptomatic patients. Early diagnosis may lead to early therapy, resulting in a milder disease course by preventing further deterioration leading to the ataxia and ophthalmoplegia usually observed in patients with postinfectious GQ1b antibody syndrome.
