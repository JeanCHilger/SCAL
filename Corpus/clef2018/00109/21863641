The analyses of Mycoplasma pneumoniae antibody test results in patients with respiratory tract infection. To investigate the relationship between the infection rate of Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) and age, sex and season.Passive agglutination assay was used to detect Mycoplasma pneumoniae antibodies (MP-Ab) in the serum of patients with respiratory tract infection, and MP-Ab test results in 2010 were analyzed.The positive rates of 5 year test results were 30.10% among the results, the positive rates of male and female patients were respectively 30.74% and 36.12%, the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05)MP infection is increasing year by year, children aged 3 to 14 has become the high-risk groups. Women are more susceptible to MP than the men and the chances of infection are throughout the year, but the most of the patients have a good prognosis.
