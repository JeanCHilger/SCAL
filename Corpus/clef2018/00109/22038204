Increased urinary calcium excretion caused by ceftriaxone: possible association with urolithiasis. The administration of ceftriaxone is known to be associated with biliary pseudolithiasis, although the development of urolithiasis has only rarely been reported. We treated a young male with bacterial meningitis complicated by urinary precipitates composed of ceftriaxone-calcium salt, which prompted us to study whether ceftriaxone administration predisposes children to the formation of urinary precipitates. The case-control study reported here included 83 children with bacterial pneumonia aged from 3 months to 8.9 years. The children were divided into one group of 43 children who received ceftriaxone (group A) and a second group of 40 children who received amoxicillin (group B). Paired samples of serum and urine before and after treatment were obtained from the patients in each group. There were no significant differences in demographic characteristics and blood biochemistry between the groups. However, the mean urinary calcium to creatinine ratio (uCa/Cr mg/mg) was significantly higher in group A patients than in group B patients after treatment (0.19 vs. 0.09, respectively
