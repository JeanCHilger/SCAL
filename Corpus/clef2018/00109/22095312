Sleep-disordered breathing is a risk factor for community-acquired alveolar pneumonia in early childhood. Data are scarce with regard to risk factors for acute community-acquired alveolar pneumonia (CAAP) in children, but it is known that children with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) experience more respiratory infections. We aimed to assess whether SDB is a risk factor for CAAP in early childhood.We conducted a prospective, nested, case-control study assessing children < 5 years old who had been given a diagnosis of CAAP based on World Health Organization radiographic criteria. Demographic and clinical data were collected. SDB symptoms were documented using a structured questionnaire. CAAP study and retrospective sleep laboratory databases were compared. SDB presence and severity were determined by questionnaire and polysomnography (PSG).A total of 14,913 children underwent chest radiography during the study period 1,546 children with radiographically proven CAAP (58% boys) and 441 control subjects (54% boys) were prospectively enrolled. Frequent snoring was reported in 18.6% vs 2.9% subjects with CAAP and control subjects, respectively (P < .001). The respective figures for subjects with CAAP and control subjects for restless sleep, nocturnal breathing problems, abnormal behavior, and chronic rhinorrhea were 21.6% vs 5.3%, 5% vs 1.4%, 6.4% vs 0.2%, and 12.9% vs 1.8%, (P < .001 for each). Fifty children (3.3%) with CAAP vs three control subjects (0.7%) underwent adenoidectomy (P < .001). PSG diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea had been established previously in 79 patients (5%) with CAAP vs six (1.3%) of the control subjects (OR, 3.7 [95% CI, 1.6-10.0]SDB is common in children with CAAP and is possibly a predisposing risk factor for CAAP in children < 5 years old. We recommend considering SDB in young children who are given a diagnosis of CAAP.
