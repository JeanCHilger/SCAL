Inframicrobiological research on cases of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. A group of 55 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, aged from 8 to 40 years, was followed and compared to a group of controls, in view of detecting a possible relation between the presence of inframicrobial agents and diabetes pathogenesis. The investigations revealed, in patients, significantly higher positivity rate of antibodies against mumps (27% versus 16.3% in controls), parainfluenza type 1 (45.4% versus 29.1%) and Epstein-Barr (54.5% versus 10.9%) viruses, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (43.6 versus 18.2%).
