Disordered systemic hemodynamics in the acute period of craniocerebral trauma complicated by pneumonia. Results are analyzed of a study of 67 patients with head injuries complicated by pneumonia. Indices of the central hemodynamics showed distinct differences in the group of patients with pneumonia in the acute period of head injury as compared with those showing uncomplicated course of head injury. Disorders of the systemic hemodynamics have a prognostic significance for the development of pneumonia in patients during the acute period of head injury. There was a distinct dependence of the degree of disorders of the systemic hemodynamics and severity of the patients' condition and normalization of cardiac function as clinical symptoms regressed and pneumonia was controlled.
