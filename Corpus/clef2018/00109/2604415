Identification of factors affecting infant growth in developing countries. The anthropometric progress of seven infants was followed throughout their first year of life. Weight, length, mid upper arm circumference, triceps and subscapular skinfold thicknesses were measured on a mean (SD) of 30 (6) occasions with weight alone being measured on a further 6 (2) occasions. The effects of infection and energy intake were identified and illustrated using both standard deviation (SD) score graphs for individual subjects, and more traditionally, regression analysis for the group. Diarrhoea and vomiting, pneumonia, and diarrhoea alone each resulted in significant reductions in growth velocity of 30 g/day. Multimeasurement SD score graphs showed the effects of all illnesses, and permitted simultaneous comparison of anthropometric measurements.
