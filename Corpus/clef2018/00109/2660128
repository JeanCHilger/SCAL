Pneumonia in childhood: peculiarities in diagnosis and therapy. Pneumonia in childhood is associated with a number of peculiar features with respect to the pathogens, the course of the disease, and its radiological appearance. The maturation of the immune system also plays a major role. Special diagnostic features involve the - sometimes discrete - clinical signs, problems with the collection of sputum, the technique employed for obtaining x-ray films of the chest, and the procedure for broncho-alveolar lavage. Only rarely is it possible to clarify the aetiology in good time. For this reason, an initial course of antibiotic treatment targeted to the probable pathogens involved, makes good sense. In accordance with the subsequent identification of the organisms responsible (successful in about 50 per cent of the cases), and the antibiogram established, the form of treatment is subsequently modified.
