Management of pneumonia in India and Indonesia. Although the death rates from neonatal tetanus have been lowered and the death rates from childhood diarrhoea are becoming lower in India and Indonesia, death rates from pneumonia have not yet begun to fall. Pneumonia has become the greatest killer of children and the most important cause of preventable death. The reason for this relative rise in significance may lie in the failure to realize that the majority of the most acute cases of respiratory illness are not viral but rather bacterial infections which rapidly respond to appropriate antibiotic therapy. This paper reviews recent research on the aetiology of pneumonia it examines age distribution and regional variation in morbidity and mortality
