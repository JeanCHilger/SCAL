Immunologic characteristics of children with varying sensitivity to tuberculin having recovered from pneumonia. The state of cellular immunity and intensity of cell tuberculin reactions were studied in tuberculin negative and tuberculin positive children recovering from pneumonia. It was shown that the state of cellular immunity in the tuberculin negative children who had had pneumonia was different and depended on the skin mark after administration of BCG vaccine. The most marked changes in T-immunity were observed in the children without the inoculation mark. The changes referred to relatively lower counts of T-lymphocytes and their inhibited functional activity. In the tuberculin sensitive children there was marked tuberculin sensitization of the immunocompetent cells independent of the presence of the postvaccinal mark which indicated increased specific reactivity in them.
