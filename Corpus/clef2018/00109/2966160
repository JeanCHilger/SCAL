Radiologic features of Dévé's accessory lobe. In 10-15% of the population a fissure, situated at the same level as the minor fissure, partially or completely separates the superior segment from the basal segments of the lower lobe, more commonly on the right. A review of 25 patients showed that the accessory lobe produced by this fissure has a characteristic appearance when consolidated or collapsed. On the frontal view the consolidation is sharply marginated inferiorly by the accessory fissure, and it does not obscure the mediastinal margin. On the lateral view it has a triangular shape bounded by the oblique and accessory fissures. When there is loss of volume the accessory fissure is elevated.
