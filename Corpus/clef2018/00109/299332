Childhood pneumonia at Goroka Hospital. We have reviewed the clinical presentation of pneumonia to the Goroka paediatric ward. In comparison to survivors, children dying from pneumonia more often (p less than 0.05) had malnutrition (weight-for-age under 80%), anaemia (haemoglobin under 9g%), and a marked leucocytosis (total white cell count over 30,000 cells per c.m.m.). Children dying from pneumonia had been ill for longer and had been given more antibiotics prior to admission. There was no significant difference between children dying from pneumonia and survivors in age distribution, pulse rate, incidence of cardiac failure or duration of stay in hospital. 70% of the children dying from pneumonia at Goroka Hospital are infants under 12 months of age. Pneumococcal vaccine gives a poor antibody response in infants, and overseas studies using lung aspiration suggest that Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus might be causative organisms as well as Streptococcus pneumoniae. A study to determine the aetiology of pneumonia in Highlands children is required to enable a rational choice of routine antibiotic therapy and to plan further research on vaccination against pneumonia.
