Role of respiratory viruses in exacerbations of primary nephrotic syndrome. To determine whether respiratory virus infections (URI) are associated with exacerbation of nephrotic syndrome (NS) in childhood, a prospective two-winter study of 32 children with NS was done. We obtained pre- and post-season viral serologic studies, biweekly nose and throat viral cultures, daily urinalysis, biweekly telephone follow-up for URI and renal complaints, and clinical assessments as indicated. When a URI occurred, viral cultures were done weekly if the child was at home and twice weekly if hospitalized. Sixty-one URIs occurred the agent was identified in 33 (51.6%) (respiratory syncytial virus 14, influenza virus five, parainfluenza virus five, varicella zoster virus four, adenovirus three, Mycoplasma pneumoniae one, and Chlamydia trachomatis one). Forty-one exacerbations occurred, 71% with URI
