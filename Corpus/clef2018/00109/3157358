Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. On the occasion of a new case and review of 9 others in the literature, the authors seek to establish the hallmarks of the nephritis occurring after M. pneumoniae infection. It often consists of an acute nephritic syndrome, 10 to 40 days after a respiratory tract infection hematological abnormalities are not constant. Histological examination of the kidney shows a type I membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis in 2, dense deposit disease in 2 and tubulo-interstitial nephritis in one. Immunofluorescence studies have shown the microbial antigen 3 times out of 4. Specific antibiotherapy does not charge the prognosis of the extrarespiratory manifestations, for which an immunologic mechanism is likely.
