Clinical manifestations of HIV infections. The wide clinical spectrum of HIV infection is reflected in the new CDC classification. Presentations range from acute infection, asymptomatic carriage and persistent lymphadenopathy through constitutional upset and neurological disease to the opportunistic infections and cancers of AIDS. AIDS is an enigmatic disease which presents special clinical diagnostic and management problems. Although any system may be affected the lungs and the brain are the most important target organs. Though the underlying disease is currently untreatable, many of the complications of AIDS are amenable to prompt therapy. Seropositive patients should be monitored to detect early signs of significant HIV disease. Skilled counselling about the avoidance of co-factors which may potentiate HIV infection, is important.
