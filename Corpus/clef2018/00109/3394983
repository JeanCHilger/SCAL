Accidental hydrocarbon ingestion cases telephoned to a regional poison center. One hundred eighty-four telephone calls to the Texas State Poison Center concerning accidental hydrocarbon ingestion were reviewed in an attempt to define the risk of developing any subsequent medical problem requiring therapeutic intervention. Special attention was given to changing symptom severity in an attempt to evaluate its usefulness in predicting future complications. One hundred twenty patients (65%) had no initial symptoms and remained asymptomatic throughout an 18-hour follow-up period. Sixty-two (34%) of patients had symptoms initially but quickly became asymptomatic. Two (1%) developed significant complications (one chemical pneumonitis, one death). These data suggest that the risk of significant complications after accidental hydrocarbon ingestion is low (approximately 1% of patients at risk). Patients who are asymptomatic or who quickly become asymptomatic can be watched safely at home, and referral of asymptomatic patients to a hospital may be unwarranted.
