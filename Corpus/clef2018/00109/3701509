Pulmonary assessment of children after chlamydial pneumonia of infancy. We evaluated the pulmonary status of 18 children 7 to 8 years after their hospitalization for chlamydial pneumonia of infancy. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and respiratory questionnaire results in this group were compared with those in a control group of 19 comparable children from the same community, and with values that other investigators have reported for normal children. Significant limitations of expiratory airflow were found (FEV1, FEV1/FVC, PEF, and FEF 25%-75%), as well as signs of abnormally elevated volumes of trapped air (FRC and RV/TLC ratios). These obstructive patterns were responsive to inhalation of isoproterenol. Moreover, a significantly greater number of patients had physician-diagnosed asthma than in the control group. The obstructive PFT abnormalities could not be accounted for by recognized risk factors, such as exposure to smoking at home or family history of atopy. Our results show that chlamydial pneumonia of infancy is associated with PFT abnormalities and respiratory symptoms 7 to 8 years after recovery from the acute illness.
