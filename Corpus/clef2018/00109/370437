Diagnostic value of a method of partial pulmonary rheography in pulmonary hypertension. In the absence of clinical and X-ray signs of pulmonary hypertension in patients with chronic pneumonia, partial rheography of the lungs revealed symptoms of increased vascular resistance in some pulmonary zones and ventilation disorders with the corresponding discordance of the ventilation-perfusion relations in the early stages, which progressed with the intensification of the stage of chronic pneumonia and the severity of pulmonary hypertension. A decrease in ventilation and perfusion in the pulmonary zones as well as a decrease of the ventilation/blood flow ratio may promote the development of zonal arterial hypoxemia, stable increase of vascular resistance, and development of pulmonary hypertension. The method of zonal rheography of the lungs may be used in the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension.
