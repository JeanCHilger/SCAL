A prospective controlled investigation of prophylactic trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in hospitalized granulocytopenic patients. Oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMZ) therapy was investigated in the prophylaxis of infections in granulocytopenia. Hospitalized granulocytopenic patients were allocated at random to receive TMP/SMZ (group 1) or to a control group (group 2). The percentage of febrile granulocytopenic days was significantly reduced in group 1, 19 per cent compared to 39 per cent in group 2 (P less than 0.01). In group 1, there were no bacteremias in 59 episodes of granulocytopenia (909 days). In group 2, there were nine bacteremias in 52 episodes of granulocytopenia (796 days)(P = 0.001). Disseminated candidiasis developed in two patients in each group. Candida occurred in similar numbers in surveillance cultures in both groups Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were slightly decreased, and Enterobacteriaceae resistant to TMP slightly increased in group 1. This study suggest that oral prophylactic TMP/SMZ therapy is an effective, well tolerated, easily administered alternative to "gut sterilization" with nonabsorbable antibiotics.
