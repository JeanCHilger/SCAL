Morbidity patterns in a new paediatric hospital in Juba, Sudan. A study of morbidity patterns in a new paediatric hospital in Juba, Sudan, showed malaria, gastroenteritis, pneumonia, dysentery and infections of the eye, ear, and skin to be the commonest conditions. During the entire period of the study, these conditions constituted more than 90% of the outpatient load. In a group of inpatients interviewed, immunization coverage was 22%, 46% of the mothers had been enrolled in school at some time, and only 17% of the families had a latrine at home. The mean number of living children per family was four and of those not surviving was two. These findings are related to an inadequate environment, lack of public health information, and low socioeconomic status. Immediate and long-term strategies are necessary to provide safe water, adequate latrines, better immunization coverage, income-generating practices, increase in female education, and general health education of females, children and youth.
