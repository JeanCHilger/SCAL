Study on a new cephamycin preparation cefminox in the field of pediatrics. Cefminox (CMNX, MT-141) was studied both fundamentally and clinically in the field of pediatrics with following results. The MIC of CMNX for Bordetella pertussis was 0.10 micrograms/ml in inoculum size 10(6) cells/ml. Following administration of 10 and 20 mg/kg of CMNX as drip infusion over 1 hour, the blood levels of the drug were 49.0 +/- 18.1 and 69.1 micrograms/ml at completion of infusion, 28.8 +/- 7.7 and 61.6 micrograms/ml at 1.5 hours, 23.6 +/- 9.3 and 44.1 +/- 3.8 micrograms/ml at 2 hours and 1.4 +/- 1.4 and 4.0 +/- 0.6 micrograms/ml at 7 hours, with T1/2 of 1.03 and 1.41 +/- 0.03 hours, respectively. Within the first 7 hours after administration, 61.4 +/- 8.2 and 55.9 +/- 0.8% of the drug dosed were excreted at active form in urine. In child with encephalitis, drug considered to be good as a cephem antibiotic was achieved in the cerebrospinal fluid (the ratio of the level in the cerebrospinal fluid to that in the serum was 7.3%). In addition, in the pus in empyema also high level was reached (its ratio against blood level was 53%). In the treatment of 31 cases of acute infections of pediatric field including upper and lower airway infections, empyema, whooping cough, acute urinary tract infections and phlegmon, CMNX was administered intravenously either as one shot injection as drip infusion. The clinical results obtained were rated as good or more in 93% of the cases and as fair or more in 100% of the cases. The main dosage of CMNX in these cases was about 60 to 70 mg/kg per day in 2 or 3 divided doses. S. aureus, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and ABPC resistant strain of E. coli demonstrated in various materials could be eradicated after intravenous injection of CMNX. CMNX was administrated for a period of 2 to 16 days to a total amount of 1.5 to 26.5 g. In none of these cases side effects developed nor any abnormality was revealed by hematological findings or results of renal or liver function.
