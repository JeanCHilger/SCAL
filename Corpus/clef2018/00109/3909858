Chlamydial infections. Chlamydiae are small bacteria that have a unique life cycle. There are two species, Chlamydia psittaci and C. trachomatis, which cause a wide spectrum of clinical disease, including neonatal conjunctivitis and pneumonia, sexually transmitted disease, psittacosis, and trachoma. The importance of chlamydial disease in public health is being increasingly recognized, and the incidence in developed countries seems to be increasing. An understanding of chlamydial disease, its prevention and treatment, is essential for the infection control practitioner, who can play a significant role in patient education.
