Patterns of pediatric gastroesophageal reflux. Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) in the pediatric patient is a frequently recognized problem. Unlike the adult, in whom symptoms relating to esophagitis predominate, the infant and child may present with a variety of respiratory problems, vomiting and/or growth failure. GER is often seen in association with other conditions and must be considered in the evaluation of any pediatric patient with chronic recurring respiratory problems, vomiting or failure to thrive (FTT). Thirty-eight pediatric patients have been surgically managed at West Virginia University from 1977-1983 for GER. The patients fall into several different patterns of presentation and associated problems. Nine premature infants all with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) have undergone fundoplication for FTT, worsening BPD, and pneumonia. Seven infants and two older children had GER associated with previous esophageal atresia repairs. Esophagitis, vomiting and growth failure were the predominant complaints in this group, though all nine patients had recurring respiratory symptoms as well. Syndromes involving mental retardation and neurologic dysfunction affected another group of five patients, all of whom presented with the complications of long-term esophagitis. The remaining 15 children were otherwise healthy infants who had predominantly respiratory symptoms due to GER. The benefits of fundoplication in these severely affected infants and children far outweigh the relatively few complications. In the carefully selected patient, surgical management of GER is dramatically successful.
