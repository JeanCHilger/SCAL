Segmental bronchomalacia: successful surgical correction in an infant. Bronchomalacia is a rare cause of recurrent pneumonia, atelectasis, and in advanced cases, respiratory failure. It is generally treated symptomatically, but in end-stage cases with respiratory failure, bronchial resection can be performed with significant clinical benefit. This paper described the second reported case of successful bronchial resection for bronchomalacia.
