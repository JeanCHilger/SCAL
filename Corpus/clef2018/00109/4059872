Severe pulmonary infection by Haemophilus aphrophilus in a non-compromised child. A Haemophilus aphrophilus pulmonary infection with abscess formation in a previously healthy 9-year-old girl is reported. This has not been reported earlier in the literature. The clinical features were extremely severe with respiratory, circulatory and renal insufficiency. Artificial ventilation for 10 days was necessary, initially with 100% oxygen and extremely high airway pressure. The girl is now in perfect health again.
