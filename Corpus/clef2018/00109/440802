Recurrent pulmonary disease in children: a complication of gastroesophageal reflux. To evaluate the role of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) as a possible cause of recurrent pulmonary disease, 30 children, aged 1 to 18 years, were studied prospectively with esophageal function tests. These included esophagram (30 patients), esophageal manometry (29 patients), pH probe (Tuttle) test (29 patients), and esophagoscopy with esophageal biopsy (23 patients). The patients studied had either chronic asthma or two or more documented pneumonias within a one-year period. Nineteen (63%) had GER based on two or more positive tests. Eighteen had positive Tuttle tests 13 had abnormal manometry studies
