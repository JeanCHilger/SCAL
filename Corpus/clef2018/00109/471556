The triad of pneumonitis, pleuritis, and pericarditis in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. There are few reports of pleuroparenchymal and pericardial involvement secondary to juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) in the literature. This article presents two such cases and gathers scattered information about this combination previously reported by few others. We wish to emphasize that the combination of pericardial and pleuropulmonary involvement in a youngster may be the only presenting clinical manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis, whereas in others, it may be associated with arthritic symptoms at the same time.
