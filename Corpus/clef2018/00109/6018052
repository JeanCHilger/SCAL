Pneumonia in Indian and Eskimo infants and children. I. A clinical study. Ninety-seven Indian and Eskimo infants and children who suffered 112 episodes of pneumonia were the subjects of a prospective study carried out at the Charles Camsell Hospital, Edmonton, Alberta, from August 1963 until August 1964. Investigation included viral studies and an evaluation 10 days after admission. The patients were divided into four diagnostic categories and a comparison was made between cases of bacterial and viral origin. The frequency of right-sided disease, particularly of the upper lobe and/or dependent segment involvement, is described. An evaluation of physical signs is attempted. The problem of recurrent pneumonia and the differential diagnosis of tuberculosis in Indian and Eskimo children with pneumonia is discussed.
