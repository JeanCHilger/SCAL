The French experience with moxalactam in pneumology. Twenty-nine patients, aged 19 to 87, were treated for an infection of the lower respiratory tract (pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, bronchitis, pulmonary abscess, pleuritis) due to a pathogen with in vitro sensitivity to the antibiotic (pneumococcus, hemophilus, anaerobic organisms . . .). Patients were given Moxalactam as the only antibacterial treatment. In most instances, excellent results (24 successes, i.e. 84% of cases) were recorded with two daily intramuscular injections of 1 g each. Biologic tolerance was satisfactory. Possible clinical side-effects are rashes and local pain during the injection. We conclude that Moxalactam is very effective in severe lower respiratory tract infections, with a daily dosage of 30 mg/kg.
