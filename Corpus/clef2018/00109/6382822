Mycoplasma pneumoniae respiratory disease symposium: summation and significance. The symposium on M. pneumoniae respiratory disease has examined the clinical expression of infection in adults and children, the pathophysiologic disturbances which occur, and the laboratory diagnosis by isolation and serology. That these infections are very common has been well documented however, a variable incidence over periods of several years tends to minimize importance of the disease for many clinicians. While good laboratory diagnostic methods exist, they provide retrospective insight predominantly and are not useful for early diagnosis or therapeutic decision making. Development of rapid diagnostic methods which are sensitive and specific is an important goal for future research. Success would facilitate our understanding and control of M. pneumoniae disease.
