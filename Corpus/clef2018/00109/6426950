Use of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the early diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. IgM and IgG antibodies to Mycoplasma pneumoniae were measured in 147 sera from four groups of patients by means of an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the results compared with those obtained by other methods. A good correlation was demonstrated between the complement fixation test and ELISA-IgM and to a lesser extent ELISA-IgG for the metabolic inhibition test the reverse was the case. The indirect haemagglutination test appeared to detect mainly IgM antibodies. Low levels of IgM antibodies were detected by ELISA in 60 sera of children not suffering from pneumonia. However, if only high titres (greater than 800) were regarded as indicative of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection, a presumptive diagnosis could have been made in 42 of 73 single acute phase sera from patients. Comparable results were obtained with IHA. The diagnostic level of IgM antibodies. was reached during the second week of the disease. It is concluded that examination of a single serum sample by either ELISA-IgM or IHA may assist in early diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection.
