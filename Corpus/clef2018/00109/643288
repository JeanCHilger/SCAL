Value and incidence rate of the inflammation of the bowels in a general children's autopsy material during twenty years (author's transl). The acute enteritis in the postneonatal period with or without dyspepsia appeared with an incidence ranging from 18,9% to 27,6% during twenty years period (1956--1975) observations in a general children's autopsy material. Bacteriological and serological analysis may be of success and complete the pathologic-anatomical diagnoses. Infective enteritis often is accompanied by pneumonia and/or otitis media. The acute enteritis can always be detected as an important feature in regard to the cause of death. Most children die within less than twenty-four hours from hospital admission. The hemorrhagic, ulcerous and necrotic form of the enterocolitis predominate the perinatal and neonatal period, frequently combined with peritonitis and bowel perforation. Bacteriological examinations should be obtained. This form of the acute enteritis and enterocolitis of the newborns must be taken into consideration of the ileus symptoms differential diagnosis.
