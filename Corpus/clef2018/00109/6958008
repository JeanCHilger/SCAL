Unusual manifestations of Chlamydia trachomatis infections. Systemic infections with Chlamydia trachomatis are known to occur with the agents of lymphogranuloma venereum but are not generally recognized to occur with the trachoma and inclusion conjunctivitis (TRIC) agents, i.e., immunotypes A-K. The clinical spectrum of TRIC agent infections has expanded, however, and now includes deep-seated genital infections such as epididymitis and salpingitis, as well as infections in neonates. Endocarditis, pneumonia in adults, otitis media, choroiditis and erythema nodosum are unusual manifestations of C. trachomatis infections that may be seen. Meningoencephalitis, chronic palmoplantar pustulosis, and pituriasis rosea also might be associated with C. trachomatis infection. Finally, lymphogranuloma venereum may have systemic manifestations, and Chlamydia psittaci infections may be characterized by extrapulmonary involvement.
