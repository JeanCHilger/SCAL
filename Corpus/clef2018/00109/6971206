Pneumatocoeles following Haemophilus influenzae pneumonia. Two children are reported who developed lung radiolucencies identical to staphylococcal pneumatocoeles after haemophilus influenzae pneumonia. Recognition that such translucencies can occur after various bacterial pneumonias is important. The radiographic appearances can be confused with congenital lung cysts, which could result in unnecessary surgery. There has been a recent increased incidence of reports of H. influenzae pneumonia in children, with lobar involvement predominating. Thus H. influenzae must be considered a significant cause of lobar pneumonia and the presence of pneumatocoeles does not preclude the diagnosis.
