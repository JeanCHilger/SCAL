Sudden deafness due to infection by Mycoplasma pneumoniae. A case is described of sudden unilateral deafness associated with Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The hearing function of the patient returned to normal on the third day of treatment with tetracycline. M pneumoniae is a common causative agent of protean respiratory disease and the true incidence of hearing loss in these cases may be higher than reflected by the occasional reports. Therefore, appropriate laboratory studies should be included in the evaluation of sensorineural loss associated with diverse infections of the respiratory tract. Prompt diagnosis facilitates the administration of specific treatment. However, the actual contribution of tetracyclines to restoration of hearing cannot be assessed.
