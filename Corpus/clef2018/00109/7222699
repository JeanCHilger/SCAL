Neurological and psychiatric manifestations in Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections in childhood (author's transl). The questions of a causal connection between Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection and neurological psychiatric diseases is discussed on the basis of the case reports of two patients and a review of the literature. Since a causal connection can be assumed in the reported cases it is suggested that infection by Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections should be included in the differential diagnosis of aetiologically unclarified meningoencephalitis, polyradiculitis, and organically-based psychoses.
