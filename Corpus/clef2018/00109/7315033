Neurologic syndromes in infants with the toxic form of pneumonia. Clinico-neurological and electroencephalographic examinations were carried out in 100 infants with the toxic form of pneumonia. A particular attention was paid to the analysis of vegetative disturbances. The results of the clinical examinations were compared with the data of morphological examinations of the brain of 10 dead infants. It was found that the leading neurological syndromes of the toxic form of pneumonia were a toxico-hypoxic coma, encephalomeningeal, and hypertensive-hydrocephalic syndromes accompanied with symptoms of vegetative nervous system depression of various gravity, and changes in the cerebrospinal fluid in the form of protein-cell dissociation.
