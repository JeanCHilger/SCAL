Clinical evaluation of cefroxadine dry syrup in children (author's transl). Clinical efficacy of cefroxadine dry syrup, a new oral cephalosporin antibiotic, was evaluated in children, and the following results were obtained. 1. Three children were given a single oral dose of about 10 mg/kg of the drug when fasting, and its blood concentrations were determined. Blood concentrations were maximum at 30 approximately 60 minutes, i.e., 16.9 approximately 18.2 microgram/ml, and markedly low at 4 hours. 2. Thirty-six patients with the following diseases were tested with 23.1 approximately 44.4 mg/kg/day of the drug in 3 to 4 divided doses 21 patients with lacunar tonsillitis, 2 with tonsillitis, 1 with scarlet fever, 4 with bronchitis and tonsillitis, 2 with cystitis, 4 with pyelonephritis, 1 with impetigo and 1 with probable Mycoplasma pneumonia. An overall efficacy rate in 35 patients excluding the last mentioned case was 91.4%, i.e., excellent in 20, good in 12 and poor in 3, and an eradication rate of the causative organisms was 88.9%. 3. Adverse reactions noted were diarrhea in 1 patient, eruption and diarrhea in 1 transient neutropenia in 1, eosinophilia in 3 and an elevation of GOT and GPT in 1. None were significant. 4. Taste and flavor of the drug was considered to be well palatable to children. 5.
