Subclinical pneumonia due to serotypes D-K of Chlamydia trachomatis. Case reports of two infants. Pneumonia due to serotypes D-K of Chlamydia trachomatis occurred in a 10-week-old baby, who had been successfully treated with chlortetracycline eye ointment for chlamydial ophthalmia neonatorum, and in a 7-week-old baby being treated for the same condition. Clinical signs of pneumonia were minimal. Such chlamydial pneumonia in infants must be under-diagnosed. Infants with chlamydial ophthalmia neonatorum are now routinely treated with erythromycin suspension by mouth in addition to chlortetracycline eye ointment.
