Single daily dose of cefodizime in patients with community-acquired pneumonia: an open-label, controlled, randomized study. The Italian Multicentre Community-Acquired Pneumonia Group. The objective of this study was to compare the clinical and bacteriologic efficacy and safety of cefodizime 1 g intramuscularly (IM) once daily (group A) versus cefodizime 1 g IM twice daily (group B) and versus ceftriaxone 1 g IM once daily (group C) in patients with community-acquired pneumonia. A total of 298 patients, affected by bronchopneumonia or pneumonia with known or suspected bacterial cause, new focal signs on examination of chest, and radiographic evidence of a recent infiltrate, were randomized in three comparable groups. The infection was rated as mild, moderate, or severe. A total of 283 patients were assessable for efficacy: 95 in group A, 94 in group B, and 94 in group C. Mean (+/- SD) duration of treatment was 5.96 +/- 1.39 days in group A, 6.24 +/- 1.57 days in group B, and 6.66 +/- 1.95 days in group C. Symptoms such as purulent sputum, cough, and dyspnea improved significantly after treatment in all groups temperature normalized by about day 3. Clinical efficacy was rated good in 94.74% of patients in group A, in 92.55% in group B, and in 87.23% in group C. Positive bacteriologic cultures were obtained before treatment from 144 patients: bacteriologic responses were rated good in 98.11%, 98.08%, and 92.80% in groups A, B, and C, respectively. No significant differences were found between the three treatment groups for any measures of clinical efficacy. No serious adverse event occurred in any of the groups. We conclude that cefodizime 1 g IM once daily is an effective dosing regimen in the treatment of patients with community-acquired pneumonia.
