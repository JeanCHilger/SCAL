Etiology of acute lower respiratory infection in Filipino children under five years. This study conducted at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine from April 1990 to December 1992, identified the etiology of acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI) in 119 (36.9%) of 317 hospitalized children < 5 years of age. A higher proportion of respiratory viruses (27.2%) than bacterial agents (10.7%) were identified. Viral agents (adenovirus, RSV, parainfluenza 3, influenza A and influenza B) and bacterial agents (mainly Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae) are the pathogenic agents involved in ALRI among Filipino children less than 5 years old.
