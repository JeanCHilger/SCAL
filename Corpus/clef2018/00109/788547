Continuous positive airway pressure in children. Difficulties in the treatment of respiratory disturbances in children and the principles and rationale of continuous positive airway pressure respiration (CPAP) are discussed. The authors present personal experiences with this method, based on 88 cases, and the clinical usefulness and safety of CPAP. Development of acute respiratory failure in children after operations, mainly, after cardiac operations, during penumonia, lung oedema and respiratory distress syndrome in newborns, were effectively prevented on condition, however, that diagnosis was made sufficiently early. Systemic recording of PA-aO2 significantly contributed to early diagnosis. The use of CPAP allowed lower oxygen concentrations in the respiratory air to be used.
