Clinical study of pneumonia in elderly patients using transtracheal aspiration (TTA). A clinical study was conducted to clarify the clinical state of pneumonia in elderly patients using transtracheal aspiration (TTA). Without prior administration of antibiotics, S. pneumoniae was the most clinically significant in both elderly and non-elderly groups whether the onset of pneumonia was hospital acquired pneumonia or community acquired pneumonia. Compared to the non-elderly group, multiple pathogens were isolated more frequently in the elderly group. Analysis about host factors showed that the number of underlying diseases per patient was more along those with poorer general conditions in the elderly group. The Brinkmann Index was also significantly higher in the elderly group. Clinical examinations before onset of pneumonia indicated that serum total protein, albumin and DNCB skin reaction were significantly lowered in the elderly group. Over the clinical course, the prognosis was poorer and the incidence of adverse reactions of antibiotics tended to be more in the elderly group. These results suggest that a complex clinical background exists for pneumonia of elderly people, related to poorer prognosis. Therefore, more cautious and meticulous care should be provided to elderly patients with pneumonia.
