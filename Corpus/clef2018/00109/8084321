Pulmonary infections in children. II - Mycoplasma pneumonia. The authors show a literary review on Mycoplasma pneumonia which represents a fifth of human pneumonia. M. pneumoniae is the major cause of illness in school-age children (5-9 years) and young adults and the peak incidence of illness occurs in this age. The infection appears mainly as an interstitial pneumonitis and the onset of illness is gradual, influence-like with few clinical symptoms and typical roentgenographic and bronchoscopic findings. Cold hemagglutinins appear in approximately 50% of patients. A severe prognosis can be associated with extrarespiratory symptoms Erythromycin (as others macrolides) is the drug of choice.
