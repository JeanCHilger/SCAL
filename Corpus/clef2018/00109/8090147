Lung infections in children. IV. Pneumonia due to Chlamydia pneumoniae. Chlamydia pneumoniae is the third strain of Chlamydia and transmission is presumed to be by droplet spread from symptomatic patients. The authors show a literature scientific review on subject-matter emphasizing several sporadic and epidemic case of illness in every age, first months excepted. The described cases are few and therefore clinical characteristics are shadowy. Certain clinical features are suggesting of severe pneumonia with fever and pharyngitis without exudate. In the childhood and in the adolescence the clinical evolution is favourable. Tetracyclines or erythromycin is recommended for therapy.
