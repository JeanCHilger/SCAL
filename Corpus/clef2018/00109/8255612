Sideroses of alveolar macrophages. Analysis of a continuous series of 360 bronchoalveolar lavages. 360 consecutive bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BAL) were studied using semi-quantitative method described by GOLDE (GOLDE score). 44 hemosiderosis were detected (12%). Most of them corresponded to massive alveolar hemorrhage (AH). Depending on pathological contexts, we distinguished three main groups of AH frequency: a group of high frequency (around 40%), an intermediate group (10%) and a low frequency group with less than 5%. Matching cytological results with clinical and radiological data, revealed that AH was often too late diagnosed because inconstancy of typical clinical and radiological signs. Even with a variable prognosis related to different physiopathological mechanisms, AH evolution is unpredictable. The authors suggest thus BAL cytological examination may systematically include a research of hemosiderosis in AH high frequency groups.
