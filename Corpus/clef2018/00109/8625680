Serum KL-6 for the evaluation of active pneumonitis in pulmonary sarcoidosis. KL-6, a mucinous high-molecular weight glycoprotein, expressed on type II pneumonocytes, is elevated in the serum of patients with active interstitial pneumonia. Forty-seven patients with histologically confirmed sarcoidosis were analyzed by chest radiography, CT, 67Ga scintigraphy, BAL fluid (BALF), and serum KL-6. Serum KL-6 level was significantly elevated in radiographic type II (945 +/- 725 U/mL n = 13
