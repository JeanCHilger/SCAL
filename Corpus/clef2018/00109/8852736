Effect of intubation timing on the clinical course of polytrauma patients with lung contusions. Aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of early intubation at the scene on the outcome of polytraumatized patients with lung-contusion.377 patients with lung-contusion out of 1031 polytraumatized patients were evaluated in this study. Patients, intubated at the scene were compared with those, who were intubated later. We compared the in-hospital time, the time at the ICU, the pneumonia-rate and the ARDS-rate. Age and injury severity of the compared groups were comparable.In-hospital time and time at the ICU were shorter in the early intubated group than in the later intubated (in-hospital time 34.5 d and 39.4 d, time at the ICU 19.9 d and 23.7 d, resp.). For the time at the ICU the difference is significant. Also a reduction was found in the pneumoniarates (23.7% and 13.2%). The ARDS rate was reduced, too, but both differences were not significant (ppneumonia = 0.053, pARDS = 0.117). The mortality also was not significantly reduced (23.4% and 22.7%, resp.).Early intubation at the scene can reduce the inhospital-time, the time at the ICU and the complications. In this way it becomes an important factor of cost-reduction. Therefore early intubation at the scene must become a standard for all patients with lung-contusion.
