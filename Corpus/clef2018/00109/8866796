Predictors for a positive blood culture in African children with pneumonia. Blood culture isolation rates for children with pneumonia are generally low. Therefore it would be helpful if epidemiologic studies could identify children who have a higher than average chance of yielding a positive culture.Simple clinical and laboratory predictors of a positive blood culture were investigated in 1222 children younger than 5 years of age with pneumonia who presented at rural dispensaries in The Gambia, West Africa.A high temperature (chi square for linear trend, 24.1 P < 0.0001), a rapid respiratory rate (chi square for linear trend, 6.33Careful selection of children investigated by blood culture could help to reduce the work required during the preparations for and conduct of pneumococcal vaccine trials.
