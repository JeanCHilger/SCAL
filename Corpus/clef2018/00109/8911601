Sub-band deletion of 7q36.3 in a patient with ring chromosome 7: association with holoprosencephaly. We report on a patient with ring chromosome 7 analyzed by both high-resolution mid-prophase G-banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) resolving a subband deletion of 7q36.3 associated with the clinical manifestation of holoprosencephaly (HPE).
