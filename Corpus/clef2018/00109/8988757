Diagnosis of Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, or Chlamydia pneumoniae lower respiratory infection using the polymerase chain reaction on a single throat swab specimen. Diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae lower respiratory infections using DNA amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on throat swab specimens has been reported. In this study we determined the sensitivity of the detection of Legionella pneumophila in simulated throat swab specimens by PCR. Next, we compared the sensitivity and specificity of a single throat swab PCR with the current tests for diagnosis of Legionella spp., M. pneumoniae, and C. pneumoniae in patients with lower respiratory tract infections. Patients' work-up included: (a) throat swab specimen for Legionella spp., M. pneumoniae, and C. pneumoniae PCR (b) throat swab specimen for C. pneumoniae culture
