Childhood bronchial mucoepidermoid tumors. A very rare case of a childhood bronchial mucoepidermoid tumor is presented. A 4-year-old girl was hospitalized with prolonged pneumonia. Computed tomography of the chest showed a tumor with calcifications in the right upper lobe. Subsequently, the patient underwent right upper lobectomy. Histologically, the tumor was a low-grade mucoepidermoid tumor originating from the bronchus. Three years postoperatively there has been no evidence of disease. A review of the literature indicates that 30 cases of bronchial mucoepidermoid tumors in children have been reported. Symptoms result from associated bronchial obstruction. Children with recurrent or prolonged pneumonia should undergo aggressive diagnostic investigation by chest tomography or bronchoscopy. Appropriate therapy for childhood bronchial mucoepidermoid tumor is total resection of the lesion while sacrificing as little of the normal lung tissue as possible.
