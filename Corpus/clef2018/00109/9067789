Pneumonia and tuberculosis in pregnancy. Antepartum pneumonia requires prompt evaluation and empiric antimicrobial therapy. The choice of antimicrobial therapy depends on maternal risk factors, symptoms, and clinical presentation. Although laboratory studies such as culture and serology should be obtained, they may not always yield a specific etiologic agent. However, prompt empiric treatment and supportive care should lead to good maternal and fetal outcomes. Similarly, in most cases, proper diagnosis and treatment of TB during pregnancy yield good maternal and fetal outcomes. TB screening is essential for the growing population of individuals with HIV infection and recent immigrants from areas where tuberculosis is endemic.
