Future indications for macrolides. The antimicrobial spectrum of azithromycin and clarithromycin suggests a number of further uses for these newer macrolides. Favorable clinical and bacteriologic responses have been reported with both antibiotics in children with community-acquired pneumonia. Response rates were high for overall patient populations and for subgroups with infection caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae. Treatment with azithromycin or clarithromycin has resulted in a reduction in mycobacteremia and an improvement in clinical symptoms in adult AIDS patients with disseminated Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex. Prophylactic treatment with azithromycin may prevent M. avium-intracellulare complex, especially when combined with rifabutin. Preliminary evidence suggests that both azithromycin and clarithromycin in multidrug combinations may effectively eradicate Helicobacter pylori and that azithromycin may be useful in treating bacterial gastritis caused by Campylobacter species. Trachoma and infections caused by Bordetella pertussis and Ureaplasma urealyticum are other possible future indications for the newer macrolides. Limited clinical evidence also suggests that azithromycin may be effective in the prevention and treatment of malaria.
