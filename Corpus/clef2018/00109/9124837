Prospective open randomized study comparing efficacies and safeties of a 3-day course of azithromycin and a 10-day course of erythromycin in children with community-acquired acute lower respiratory tract infections. The efficacies and safeties of a 3-day, 3-dose course of azithromycin (10 mg/kg of body weight per day) and a 10-day, 30-dose course of erythromycin (40 mg/kg/day) for the treatment of acute lower respiratory tract infections in children were compared in an open randomized multicenter study. Sixty-eight of 85 evaluable patients (80%) had radiologically proven pneumonia, and 20% had bronchitis. Treatment success defined as cure or major improvement was achieved in 42 of 45 (93%) azithromycin recipients versus 36 of 40 (90%) erythromycin recipients. Adverse events were reported in 12 of 45 and 6 of 40 of the patients treated with azithromycin and erythromycin, respectively, a difference which was not statistically significant. In conclusion, a 3-day course of azithromycin is as effective as a 10-day course of erythromycin in the treatment of community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections in children, with comparable safety and acceptability profiles. This shorter treatment course might have a beneficial effect on compliance, especially in the pediatric age group.
