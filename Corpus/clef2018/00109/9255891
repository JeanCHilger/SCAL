Adenosine deaminase activity in the aetiological diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. A prospective study was undertaken to assess the usefulness of serum adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity in the aetiological diagnosis of 75 patients (mean age 58 years) with community-acquired pneumonia who required hospitalization. Measurements of ADA were also carried out in 35 healthy subjects (mean age 52 years). The serum ADA activity in patients with typical bacterial pneumonia (TBP) was 21 +/- 7 IU/l and in controls 22 +/- 9 IU/l. In 43 patients with atypical pneumonia (AP), ADA levels (43 +/- 23 IU/l) were significantly higher than in the previously related groups (p < 0.001). Analysis within the group of atypical pneumonia showed significant differences for infections caused by Coxiella burnetii (61 +/- 19 IU/l, p < 0.001), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (44 +/- 26 IU/l, p < 0.001) and Legionella pneumophila (39 +/- 15 IU/l, p < 0.05), as compared with patients with bacterial pneumonia and normal control subjects. We conclude that serum ADA in patients with community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization may provide useful additional diagnostic information on the aetiology of pulmonary infection.
