A case of Morgagni hernia presenting as pneumonia. Morgagni-type diaphragmatic hernias are rare. The overwhelming majority are discovered in children who usually present with pneumonia or sepsis.

It is important to entertain abdominal etiologies in the differential diagnosis of a thoracic density.
