Nursing study of supporting aerosolized oxygen by combined drug liquid in children with intensive pneumonia. 148 cases of critical pneumonia at the same period were divided into two groups randomly and supplied by two oxygen therapeutic methods. The study group has 75 cases, whom were given aerosolized oxygen with antibacterial, antiphlogistic drugs, expectorants, antispastic and antiasthmatic drugs, and compared with 73 cases of convenient simple with aerosolized oxygen inhalation. The results showed the frequency, time and starting effect time of inhaling oxygen in two groups have significant difference (P < 0.001) and the alteration of SaO2 and the therapeutic effect in two groups also have significant difference (P < 0.05, P < 0.005 respectively). The total effectual rates of the study and control group were 94.66% and 73.94% respectively. The difference between the duration of hospitalization and the therapeutic expenditure in two groups were significance (P < 0.01, P < 0.05 respectively). The study indicated that aerosolized oxygen combined drug liquid is a better oxygen therapy method for treating pneumonia.
