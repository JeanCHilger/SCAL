Increased prevalence of infectious diseases and other adverse outcomes in human T lymphotropic virus types I- and II-infected blood donors. Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study (REDS) Study Group. Disease associations of human T lymphotropic virus types I and II (HTLV-I and -II) infection were studied in 154 HTLV-I-infected, 387 HTLV-II-infected, and 799 uninfected blood donors. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 99% confidence intervals (CIs) were derived from logistic regression models controlling for demographics and relevant confounders. All subjects were human immunodeficiency virus type 1-seronegative. HTLV-II was significantly associated with a history of pneumonia (OR, 2.6 99% CI, 1.2-5.3), minor fungal infection (OR, 2.9
