Complications of typhoid perforation of the ileum in children after surgery. Sixty six consecutive cases of typhoid perforation of the ileum in children between the ages of four and 14 years were analysed. 62.1% of the children were boys and 37.9% girls, a boy/girl ratio of 1.6:1.0. Postoperative complications included: wound infection, gaped wounds, intestinal obstruction secondary to adhesions, wound dehiscence and pneumonia. The most serious complication was enterocutaneous fistula and the most frequent was wound infection. These postoperative complications adversely affected the morbidity and mortality rates of these severely ill and debilitated patients with typhoid perforation of the ileum--a serious complication of enteric fever.
