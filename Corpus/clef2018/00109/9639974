Evaluation of bacteriological research data and laboratory symptoms of infection in the diagnosis of congenital and acquired infections. The predisposition of the newborns to contract infections diseases is dependent upon the limited efficiency of their immune mechanisms. Congenital infections amount to 5.7% in the research material, and the acquired infections 1.15%. The isolation of the microorganism is the basis for treating infections-the profiles of the pathogenic bacterial in flora were subjected to analysis. Im generalised infections Stafphylococcus epidermidis makes 56.6% and E. Coli accounts for 87.5 of the infections of the urinary system. In our research the late sepsis and pneumonia are more frequently the result of the hospital infection (14.2%) in the cases of congenital infections-pneumonia and the infection of the urinary system (72%). Hematologic indicators such as: leucopenia, thormbocytopenia, I/T are distinct infection markers (those were found in 31% of the cases). The CRP protein shows the lowest values in congenital infections, still monitoring its level is useful for assessing the effectiveness of the undertaken antybacterial treatment. The newborns of male sex (58%) more often prone to infection. Pneumonia is the manifestation pertaining to an organ in 70% of congenital infections, the infection of urinary system amounts to 17.1%.
