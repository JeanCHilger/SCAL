Swyer James syndrome following Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia: report of one case. A previous healthy 5 year-old girl developed a right hyperlucent lung following Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia 14 months before admission. Serial chest radiographs revealed a persistent right upper lobe atelectasis and gradual development of the right hyperlucent lung associated with frequent bouts of wheezing and exertional dyspnea. Physical examination showed markedly decreased breathing sounds in the right hemithorax with fine inspiratory crackles and expiratory wheezes. A diagnosis of Swyer James syndrome was confirmed by the exclusion of other causes of unilateral hyperlucent lung using computed tomographic scans of chest, fiberoptic bronchoscopy and lung perfusion scintigraphy. She has been followed up at our hospital using anti-asthmatic medication.
