Impact of a case management protocol for childhood pneumonia in a rural Zambian hospital. This study aimed to assess the impact of adopting the WHO case management protocol for childhood pneumonia in a district hospital in rural Zambia. The subjects were children under 5 years of age with a diagnosis of pneumonia, admitted in the 9-month period following introduction of the WHO protocol. Management and outcome were compared with a historical control group admitted during the same period in the previous year. There were 158 children in the intervention group and 135 controls with similar age and sex distribution. Both groups were malnourished (mean weight-for-age Z score in subjects = -1.91, in controls = -1.83). There was no significant difference in the numbers receiving parenteral antibiotics or supplementary fluids in each group. However, children in the intervention group were significantly more likely to receive oxygen (odds ratio 4.7, 95% confidence interval 2.8-8.1, p < 0.0001). Mortality was significantly greater in the control group (case fatality rate, 25%) compared with the intervention group (case fatality rate, 15% chi 2 = 4.6
