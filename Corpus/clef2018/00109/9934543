Clinical and pharmacological evaluation of a modified cefotaxime bid regimen versus traditional tid in pediatric lower respiratory tract infections. It is generally accepted that the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, either in adults or in pediatric patients, is mainly empirical. Thus, the treatment selection must fulfill both the epidemiological requirements, according to the most frequently described pathogens, and the pharmacological criteria to ensure adequate and prolonged drug concentrations at the infection site, to reach clinical efficacy. Cefotaxime has proven to be effective in this indication when traditionally administered three times daily and, more recently, twice daily, as a result of a re-evaluation of its pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic features. To gain further evidence using this updated dosing schedule, 258 pediatric patients with lower respiratory tract infections were treated with cefotaxime 100 mg/kg/day, administered as a twice daily or three times daily regimen. In the cefotaxime 50 mg/kg twice-daily group (n = 130), a complete resolution of clinical signs and symptoms were observed in 88.5% of patients. Similarly, in the cefotaxime 33.3 mg/kg group (n = 128), 93.6% of patients had a complete resolution of clinical signs and symptoms. Both drug schedules were well tolerated. Pharmacokinetic parameters determined for the two cefotaxime dosing schedules showed comparability. The serum half-life of desacetylcefotaxime was marginally longer than for cefotaxime in both dosage groups (1.64 and 1.36 h for desacetylcefotaxime versus 1.2 and 0.85 h for cefotaxime after 50 mg/kg or 33.3 mg/kg doses, respectively). Results from this study support the use of twice-daily cefotaxime administration for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections in pediatric patients.
