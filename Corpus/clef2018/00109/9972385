Trovafloxacin: a new fluoroquinolone. To review the pharmacology, antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and safety of trovafloxacin.A MEDLINE search (January 1966-April 1998) was conducted for relevant literature using the terms CP-99,219, CP-116,519, trovafloxacin, and alatrofloxacin. Abstracts published by the American Society of Microbiology during 1995-1997 meetings were also reviewed.All in vitro, animal, and human studies were reviewed for the antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of trovafloxacin.Trovafloxacin is a new fluoroquinolone with enhanced activity against gram-positive and anaerobic microorganisms. The oral bioavailability under fasting conditions is approximately 88%. The elimination half-life of trovafloxacin is approximately 10 hours. Less than 10% of trovafloxacin is eliminated unchanged in the urine. Trovafloxacin is effective in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and nosocomial pneumonia with cure rates of > 90% and 77%, respectively. Trovafloxacin is comparable with ceftriaxone in the treatment of meningococcal meningitis in children each produces a cure rate of approximately 90%. In treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection, both ciprofloxacin and trovafloxacin achieve an eradication rate of > or = 93%. Trovafloxacin is similar to ofloxacin in the treatment of urogenital Chlamydia trachomatis and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, with clinical success in 97% of patients with each drug. The common adverse effects of trovafloxacin include dizziness, headache, and gastrointestinal intolerance.The advantages of once-daily dosing and enhanced activity of trovafloxacin against gram-positive and anaerobic organisms may expand its use over available fluoroquinolones. Further studies are needed to define its role in the treatment of various infectious diseases.
