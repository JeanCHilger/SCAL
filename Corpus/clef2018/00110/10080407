Cytomegalovirus pneumonitis after kidney transplantation is not caused by plugging of cytomegalic endothelial cells only. In addition to life-threatening pneumonia, cytomegalovirus (CMV) may also cause subclinical pulmonary dysfunction after kidney transplantation. To investigate the role of plugging of cytomegalic endothelial cells in the pulmonary capillary bed, we prospectively determined specific carbon monoxide diffusion capacity (KCOc) and its components: the pulmonary diffusing membrane factor (Dm) and pulmonary capillary blood volume (Vcap) before and during CMV infection in 13 kidney transplant recipients and 13 controls. During CMV infection, mean KCOc decreased significantly by 28 % of the initial value (mean KCOc 79 vs 109 P < 0.005 ) due to a decrease in both Vcap and Dm. The KCOc in controls showed a significantly smaller decrease due to a slightly lower Vcap. We conclude that kidney transplant recipients with CMV infection have significant pulmonary diffusion disturbances due to a combination of lower Vcap and lower Dm. The most likely explanation for this phenomenon is a local inflammatory process due to CMV and not plugging of cytomegalic endothelial cells only.
