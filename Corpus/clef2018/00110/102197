Experimental group B streptococcal infection in the rhesus monkey. I. Disease production in the neonate. Group B streptococci (GBS) are responsible for serious infections of newborn infants. An experimental model for GBS infection was developed in the newborn rhesus monkey in order to obtain more information concerning the pathogenesis of such infections. A series of 29 newborn monkeys were inoculated with either type Ic or type III GBS or sterile broth. Fatal neonatal meningitis without associated pneumonia was produced consistently following intracerebral inoculation with either type Ic or type III intracerebral inoculation with sterile broth produced no apparent disease. Variable disease production followed intravenous or intra-amniotic GBS inoculation, and clinical manifestations ranged from no apparent disease to fatal meningitis and pneumonia. This monkey model may be useful for further investigation of treatment and prevention of neonatal GBS infection.
