Mortality in a cohort of children born to HIV-1 infected women from Durban, South Africa. To describe mortality in a cohort of infants with vertically transmitted HIV-1 infection.Children of HIV-1 infected women were followed up from birth and a record was made at each visit of growth, development and all illnesses. Details surrounding death were obtained from hospital records.The final cohort comprised 48 infected and 93 uninfected children there were 25 deaths, 17 of which (35%) were regarded as being HIV-related. The mean age at death of HIV-related cases was 10.1 months (range 1-48 months), with 83% of HIV-related deaths occurring before the age of 10 months. The commonest diagnoses at the time of death were diarrhoea, pneumonia, failure to thrive and severe thrush. These findings, together with neurological abnormalities, often presaged rapid deterioration and death.Mortality among children with vertically acquired HIV infection is high in the first year of life. Death in these subjects was due to the common causes of morbidity and mortality among all children in developing countries. A combination of diarrhoea, pneumonia, failure to thrive, and neurological abnormalities should alert one to the possibility of rapidly progressive disease and death.
