Unilateral leptospiral pneumonia and cold agglutinin disease. Pneumonia that is unresponsive to appropriate antibiotic therapy suggests an infection due to more unusual or resistant organisms. In this report, a child with unilateral pneumonia, pleural effusion, and anti-I cold hemagglutinin antibodies is presented. The usual causes of this clinical picture were suspected and treated, but the child did not improve. Features of her history suggested a more unusual etiology, and a diagnosis of leptospirosis was made. A brief discussion of leptospiral disease in children is provided.
