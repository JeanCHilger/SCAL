Infectious complications of heart transplantation. A prospective study for the first 6 years of a transplantation program. To study the infectious complications, mortality, and associated factors in heart transplant recipients.Prospective study of the first 69 heart transplantations performed from January 1991 until December 1996 in a university hospital. Description of clinical features of infectious complications during the first year after transplantation. Univariate and multivariate analyses of the risk factors associated with mortality and development of infectious complications.Seventy-three percent of patients had at least one infectious complication the incidence was 1.13 episodes per patient-year. The etiology of complications was bacterial (50%), viral (31%), Pneumocystis carinii (5%), fungal (4%), and protozoal (4%). The opportunist organisms accounted for 42% of cases. Pneumonia was the most common complication (28%), followed by mucocutaneous herpetic reactivation (19%), bacteremia (13%), urinary tract infection (13%), cytomegalovirus disease (11.5%), pleural empyema (5%) and surgical wound infection (5%). Nosocomial pneumonia accounted for 50% of cases. Gram-negative rods accounted for 41% of pneumonia cases. A total of 62.5% of deaths were directly related to infectious complications. Factors independently associated with mortality were hospital origin at transplantation (RR = 4.5 [2-9], p = 0.034), development of infectious complications in the post-heart transplantation period (RR = 3.2 [1.2-12], p = 0.04) and a more prolonged hospital stay at ICU (p = 0.0004). The factor which was independently associated with the development of infectious complications was one or more severe episodes of acute rejection (RR = 1.5 [1.1-2.2], p = 0.04). Patients who developed infectious complications had a more prolonged accumulated annual hospital stay (p = 0.004) than those without infectious complications.Infectious complications are very common, prolong hospital stay, and are the first cause of mortality during the first year after transplantation. Bacteria are the most common etiology and pneumonia is the most common infection.
