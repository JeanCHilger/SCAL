Moraxella catarrhalis bacteremia: a 10-year experience. Moraxella catarrhalis commonly inhabits the upper respiratory tract and is a cause of acute otitis media and sinusitis in children. It is an infrequent cause of invasive disease.We reviewed records of all patients with positive blood cultures for M catarrhalis admitted to our hospital during the 10-year period (1988 through 1997).Eleven cases were identified. Age range was 11 to 32 months. Four (44%) had risk factors for infection, including sickle cell disease (2), acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (1), and leukopenia (1). Upper respiratory symptoms and fever were present in all patients. Ten had acute otitis media, five had sinusitis, and three had pneumonia. All isolates were beta-lactamase producers. Treatment included intravenous cefuroxime (8), cefotaxime (2), and ceftazidime (1), followed by oral amoxicillin/clavulanate or cefuroxime axetil.Moraxella catarrhalis bacteremia should be considered in febrile young children with upper respiratory infections and/or acute otitis media especially in those with underlying immune dysfunction.
