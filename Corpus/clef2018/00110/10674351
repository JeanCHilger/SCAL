Detection of microorganisms in the tracheal aspirates of preterm infants by polymerase chain reaction: association of adenovirus infection with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is recognized as an important cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Because the role of congenital infections in BPD has been debated, the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that detection of infectious agents in tracheal aspirate samples was associated with the development of BPD. Tracheal aspirate samples were obtained within the 1st week of life and screened by polymerase chain reaction for adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, parvovirus, enteroviruses, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia species. BPD was defined as persistent oxygen dependence at 28 d of age and 36 wk postconceptional age (PCA). Infants that expired before these time points were excluded from statistical analysis. Out of 89 infants studied, at 28 d of life, 13 had expired, 45 had BPD, and 31 had no BPD (controls). At 36 wk PCA, 15 infants expired, 39 still had BPD, and 35 did not. A significant increase in the frequency of adenovirus genome was identified in BPD patients compared with controls, both at 28 d of life (12/45 = 27% versus 1/31 = 3%: p< or =0.01) and at 36 wk PCA (10/39 = 29% versus 2/35 = 6%: p = 0.01). Other microorganisms were rarely detected and not associated with the development of BPD. This is the first study reporting the frequency of detection of adenovirus DNA in tracheal aspirate samples obtained during the 1st week of life from infants with BPD and suggests that prenatal acquisition may be important in the development of BPD.
