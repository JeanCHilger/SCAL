Caseous pneumonia in a 14-month-old infant. We report a case of caseous pneumonia in a 14-month-old HIV-negative infant. This clinical picture is usually observed in healthy young adults, rarely in infants. The clinical and radiological signs of caseous pneumonia often simulate acute non-tuberculous respiratory disease. Bacteriological confirmation is required, but the diagnosis can be suggested in case of a pulmonary syndrome with no bacterial isolate and unresponsive to well-conducted antibiotic therapy. The clinical course is rapid with caseous involution of the lung. Early diagnosis is required for specific curative treatment and to limit sequelae.
