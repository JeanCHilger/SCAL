Clinical features and etiology of community-acquired pneumonia at a general hospital between 1994 and 1997. To characterize the clinical features and etiology of recently encountered cases of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), we carried out a hospital-based retrospective study of 120 episodes of CAP (115 patients) at Tagami Hospital, Nagasaki City between 1994 and 1997. We identified the causative pathogens in 55 episodes (50 patients) by sputum Gram stain and quantitative culture, for a determination rate of 45.8%.
