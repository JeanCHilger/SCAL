Myositis caused by a mycoplasma infection. Mycoplasma pneumonia infection can be associated with neurological manifestations such as meningoencephalitis, cerebellitis, aseptic meningoitis, polyradiculopathy, transverse myelitis, cranial nerve palsies and myositis [4, 5]. We report a case of a white female 11 years, 2 months old child, who presented with a 3 day history of pain in the left leg. The electromyograpy showed pathological signs. We found a serological titer of IgM antibodies for Mycoplasma pneumoniae. By treatment with erythromycin the complaints improved quickly.A myositis can be caused with an infection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The differential diagnosis is essential.
