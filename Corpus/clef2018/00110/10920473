Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV): a review. Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) infection is the major cause of respiratory disease in calves during the first year of life. The study of the virus has been difficult because of its lability and very poor growth in cell culture. However, during the last decade, the introduction of new immunological and biotechnological techniques has facilitated a more extensive study of BRSV as illustrated by the increasing number of papers published. Despite this growing focus, many aspects of the pathogenesis, epidemiology, immunology etc. remain obscure. The course and outcome of the infection is very complex and unpredictable which makes the diagnosis and subsequent therapy very difficult. BRSV is closely related to human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) which is an important cause of respiratory disease in young children. In contrast to BRSV, the recent knowledge of HRSV is regularly extensively reviewed in several books and journals. The present paper contains an updated review on BRSV covering most aspects of the structure, molecular biology, pathogenesis, pathology, clinical features, epidemiology, diagnosis and immunology based on approximately 140 references from international research journals.
