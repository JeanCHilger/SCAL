CT findings of pneumonia after lung transplantation. The purpose of this study was to describe the CT findings of pneumonia in patients who had undergone lung transplantation and to determine if specific imaging features existed for the different infectious organisms.The authors retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 262 patients with transplanted lungs at two lung transplantation centers. Patients with a documented pneumonia and correlating abnormal findings on CT (39 patients with 45 pneumonias) were included in the study. RESULTS. Of 45 pneumonias, Cytomegalovirus (n = 15), Pseudomonas (n = 7), and Aspergillus (n = 8) organisms were the most common single responsible infectious agents. The most common CT findings of pneumonia consisted of consolidation (n = 37 82%), ground-glass opacification (n = 34The manifestations revealed on CT of bacterial, viral, and fungal pneumonia after lung transplantation are similar, consisting of a combination of consolidation, ground-glass opacification, septal thickening, pleural effusion, or multiple nodules. Therefore, these findings cannot be used to suggest the infectious organisms in this patient population.
