The influence of severe infections on the natural killer cells in neonates with vary gestational age. In 27 infected neonates (16 boys and 11 girls) with birth weight ranged from 1200 to 4500 g (mean 2670 +/- 827 g) and gestational age from 31 to 41 weeks (mean 36.7 +/- 4.1), among them 11 (41%) with birth asphyxia, between 1 and 7 day of life flow cytometric immunophenotyping of the relative sizes of natural killer cells (CD3-/CD16-56+) using monoclonal antibodies of Becton Dickinson were made. The following infections were diagnosed in the neonates: bacterial septicemia (gram-positive in 13 cases, gram-negative in 5 cases), pneumonia in 6 cases and purulent meningitis in 3 cases. Control group consisted of full-term, healthy, eutrophic neonates born in Military Medical Academy in Lódź between 1994-95 years, in which immunological studies were made with the same method and dr Banasik, agreed for using her results for statistical analysis. It was stated, that in infected full-term neonates the mean relative size of NK cells was 10.7 +/- 5.1% and in prematures 12.8 +/- 7.2% and did'n differ significantly from the control. Kind of infection had no significant influence on the mean relative size of these cells, because in septic neonates was 11.7 +/- 5.7% and in other infected babies 11.6 +/- 7.2%. It was found that infected neonates without respiratory insufficiency and shock had significantly higher (13.2 +/- 6.4%) relative size of NK cells than healthy. The lowest value (7.0 +/- 4.8%) of NK cells during infections in dead neonates were noted (4 cases, among them 2 septic with shock and 2 pneumonic prematures with intraventricular haemorrhages).The severity and bad results of the treatment in neonatal infections may be due to deficit of NK cells.
