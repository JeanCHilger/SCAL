Should you vaccinate patients in your ED? Check out these unique protocols. Although controversial, ED vaccination programs can successfully target minority, low-income, and uninsured populations. Without access to vaccination registries, only single-shot immunizations such as influenza and pneumococcal are feasible in the ED. For a vaccine program to be financially feasible, an ED needs a significant Medicaid population and low immunization rates in the community. Protocols for vaccine programs should delegate the responsibility to nursing with standing orders.
