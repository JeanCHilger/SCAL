Experiences at a large teaching hospital with levofloxacin for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. Costs, patient outcomes, and susceptibility patterns of selected organisms after the implementation of guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) at a large community teaching hospital were analyzed to assess the benefit of the guidelines. The guidelines, implemented in September 1998, included recommendations for the use of levofloxacin as the preferred antimicrobial, with rapid intravenous (i.v.) to oral (p.o.) conversion. Purchase data for levofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin were analyzed, as well as susceptibilities and demographic and outcome data for patients admitted in 1999 in diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) 89 and 90 (simple pneumonia with and without comorbidities, respectively). Patients in each DRG were divided into a levofloxacin use only (LUO) group and an all other therapies (AOT) group. Average length of stay (LOS), hospital costs, death rate, age, and ratio of oral to intravenous dosage administration were analyzed. A total of 571 patients in DRG 89 and 110 patients in DRG 90 were included. The average LOS for DRG 89 was not significantly different between LUO patients and AOT patients (3.56 +/- 2.23 days and 3.88 +/- 2.65 days, respectively). Average total costs were significantly higher for AOT patients ($3385 +/- $2937 versus $2892 +/- $2397 for LUO patients) similar trends but no significant differences were found in the DRG 90 group. In the LUO groups in both DRGs, patients were more than five times as likely to receive an oral dosage form than patients in the AOT group. For DRG 89, the death rate was significantly lower for the LUO group (1.29%) than the AOT group (7.1%). Susceptibility data for all organisms remained stable from 1998 to 1999. The average costs in the AOT groups suggest that total hospital costs for 1999 in the LUO group were $241,516 less than costs would have been before guideline implementation. Combined drug acquisition cost savings in 1999 for levofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin were $21,115. The use of CAP treatment guidelines was associated with reductions in antimicrobial costs, total hospitalization costs, LOS, and death rate, without a detrimental effect on organism susceptibility.
