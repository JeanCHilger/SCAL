Septic shock and respiratory failure in community-acquired pneumonia have different TNF polymorphism associations. Genetic factors are likely to contribute to the variable presentation of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The purpose of this prospective cohort study was to determine whether the LTalpha+250 (TNFbeta+250) and TNFalpha-308 gene polymorphisms are associated with different presentations of CAP. Septic shock (SS) was defined using American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine (ACCP-SCCM) criteria. Type I respiratory failure (T1RF) was defined as an O(2) saturation on room air of < 90% with a normal PCO(2). A total of 280 patients were genotyped 31 had SS, 80 had T1RF. Genotype proportions are given in the order of AA/GA/ GG. The proportion of patients in each genotype developing SS was as follows: LTalpha+250 0.19/0.07/0.09 (p = 0.01 AA versus non-AA)
