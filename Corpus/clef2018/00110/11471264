Group A beta-haemolytic streptococcal acute chest event in a child with sickle cell anaemia. Acute chest syndrome is a major cause of death and hospitalisation in children with sickle cell anaemia. It is often initiated by an infection, particularly pneumonia. Microbial agents previously not associated with acute chest syndrome are becoming increasingly important. Group A beta-haemolytic Streptococcus (GABHS) is thought to be an uncommon cause of pneumonia in children with sickle cell anaemia. We report a 15-year-old African-American girl who presented with an acute chest event characterised by fever, cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, right upper abdominal quadrant pain, jaundice and otitis media. Chest radiograph showed multi-lobar pneumonia with left pleural effusion. Group A beta-haemolytic Streptococcus was isolated from culture of pleural and middle ear fluids. She responded to therapy that included antibiotics, exchange blood transfusion, oxygen, thoracotomy chest tube drainage and decortication. In a child with sickle cell anaemia presenting with fever and an acute chest event, pneumonia should be considered and GABHS recognised as a possible aetiological agent. In addition, a chest X-ray should be obtained and antibiotics against agents causing community-acquired pneumonia instituted.
