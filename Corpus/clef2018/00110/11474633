Efficacy and safety of gemifloxacin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia: a randomized, double-blind comparison with trovafloxacin. This multicentre, randomized, double blind, parallel group study compared the efficacy and safety of gemifloxacin (320 mg once daily) with trovafloxacin (200 mg once daily) in 571 patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Although treatment was given routinely for 7 days it could be extended to 14 days two-thirds of patients were treated for 7 days. High clinical success rates were noted at follow-up in the per-protocol population in both the gemifloxacin group (95.8%) and the trovafloxacin group (93.6%), non-inferiority with 95% CI. In the intent-to-treat population, the clinical success rate at follow-up was significantly superior for gemifloxacin (87.6%) compared with trovafloxacin (81.1%
