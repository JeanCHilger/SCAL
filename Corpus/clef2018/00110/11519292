Early onset mixed Morganella and Klebsiella sepsis in a neonate. A premature baby girl was delivered vaginally to a mother who had an otherwise normal pregnancy, and spontaneous premature onset of labour. She had early onset neonatal sepsis with pneumonia. The baby's blood culture as well as the amniotic membrane culture grew Morganella and Klebsiella. She recovered on appropriate antibiotics. This is only the second reported case of early onset neonatal sepsis due to Morganella. The literature is reviewed.
