Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in an adolescent. A 17-year-old boy presented with a severe form of an acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) with hemiparesis and coma after initial symptoms of a flu-like febrile infection 1 week previously. Titers against Mycoplasma pneumoniae were significantly increased in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Detection of M. pneumoniae was achieved in the initial CSF sample using M. pneumoniae-specific PCR. The patient improved significantly on antimicrobial therapy with erythromycin and immunosupressive therapy with immunoglobulins and corticosteroids. This case report demonstrates a well-documented course of a central nervous system (CNS) infection resulting in the ADEM syndrome.
