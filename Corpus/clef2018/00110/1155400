High fever. Experience in private practice. Experience with confirmed high fever, 40 C (104 F) or more, in a private practice during 14 years is presented. The records of 1,500 patients covering 8,000 patient years disclosed only 108 confirmed episodes of high fever. Eleven diagnostic categories included 149 diagnoses. Fourteen of 43 roentgenographic examinations yielded positive findings, including two cases of pneumonia not detected on physical examination. Two of six stool cultures yielded specific enteric pathogens. Convulsions occurred in 12 of the 108 episodes of high fever, and recurred only once in one child. There were no deaths in this series of children with high fevers. Only one diagnosis, pneumonia, was significantly more frequent in confirmed high fever than in unconfirmed high fever. Lastly, the ability of a group of mothers to read thermometers set at three different temperatures proved to be surprisingly good.
