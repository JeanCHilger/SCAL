Young child with fever of unknown origin in the 'post Haemophilus influenzae era'. A 2.5-year-old boy and a 2-month-old girl presented with fever without an apparent source. Additional laboratory tests were requested due to alarming signs for the presence of a serious bacterial infection. Pneumonia and viral meningitis respectively were diagnosed, and adequate therapy led to a quick and complete recovery. Due to changing prospects following the near eradication of invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) infections by vaccination, there are no suitable guidelines at present concerning fever without an apparent source in children. A selection of patients at risk can first of all be made based on patient history and a physical examination and secondly by carrying out additional laboratory tests. Furthermore, careful evaluation, clinical acumen, well-informed parents and observation are all important elements in the treatment of these patients.
