Mycoplasma and Chlamydia pneumonia in pediatrics. Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae are common respiratory pathogens in children 5 years of age and older. Although distinctly different in structure, these organisms share similar epidemiologic and clinical characteristics in human infection and disease. Pneumonia caused by these organisms usually occurs after infection of the upper respiratory tract, but may occur in the absence of antecedent upper respiratory infection. Diagnosis of infection with C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae is most often based on clinical findings alone, though definitive diagnosis of infection with either organism may be confirmed through serologic methods, culture, and nucleic acid-detection methods such as polymerase chain reaction. Macrolide antibiotics are highly effective in the treatment of infected children, leading to rapid clinical resolution and excellent long-term out-come in the majority of patients.
