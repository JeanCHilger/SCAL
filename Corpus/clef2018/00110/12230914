Endotoxin in the environment--exposure and effects. This review deals with endotoxin in the environment and its relation to disease among exposed persons. Data are presented on levels of endotoxin in different environments with maximum values of several microg/m(3). The cellular reactions of importance for inhalation exposure effects are attachment to lipopolysaccharide binding protein, CD14 cell surface protein and TLR-4 receptors. The internalisation of endotoxin in macrophages and endothelial cells results in local production of inflammatory cytokines with subsequent migration of inflammatory cells into the lung and the penetration of cytokines into the blood. These events orchestrate clinical effects in terms of toxic pneumonitis, airways' inflammation and systemic symptoms. Inhalation challenges with pure endotoxin and field studies confirm the relation between these effects and exposure to dusts containing endotoxin. It is possible that polymorphism in genes determining endotoxin reactivity, particularly TLR-4, influences the risk for disease after environmental exposures. Some data suggest that the inflammation caused by inhaled endotoxin may decrease the risk for atopic sensitisation among children and lung cancer among workers exposed to organic dust. Additional research is needed to clarify the role of other environmental agents that are present in connection with endotoxin, particularly (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan from mold cell walls.
