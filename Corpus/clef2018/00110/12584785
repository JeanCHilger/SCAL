Clinical observation on treatment of gastrointestinal dysfunction by fu'an liquid for retention enema in children with critical illness. To observe the therapeutic effect of Fu'an Liquid (FAL) for retention enema in treating gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction of children with critical illness.Eighty-nine patients were randomly divided into two groups, 52 in the treated group and 37 in the control group. Conventional therapy of western medicine was given to both groups and to the treated group FAL was given additionally. Plasma endothelin (ET) level was measured during admission, GI dysfunction occurrence and after treatment, and the therapeutic effect as well as the recovery of GI condition were observed.The total effective rate of FAL in treating GI dysfunction was 84.62%, which was significantly higher than that in the control group (62.17%) (P < 0.05). In the treated group, 34 cases were treated successfully, 16 died and the other 2 abandoned, the mortality rate being 30.77%, while in the control group, the corresponding numbers were 16, 18, 3 and 48.65%. The mortality rate in the treated group was lower than that in the control group (chi 2 = 4.64, P < 0.05). Level of ET in both groups was higher than normal range during admission (P < 0.01), it further increased when GI dysfunction occurred (P < 0.01), and decreased when successfully treated, the decrease was quicker in the treated group than that in the control group (P < 0.05).In children with critical illness, ET level would increase when the patient was complicated with GI dysfunction. FAL for retention enema could reduce the ET level effectively, promote the recovery of patients from GI dysfunction, so as to play a definite role in enhancing the successful rate of rescue.
