Cystatins C, E/M and F in human pleural fluids of patients with neoplastic and inflammatory lung disorders. Secretory type 2 cystatins, like cystatins C, E/M and F, are thought to be involved in many pathobiological processes, including vascular amyloidosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis, viral and bacterial infections, inflammatory disorders and tumour invasion and metastasis. In order to define the levels of cystatins C, E/M, and F in pleural effusions and to investigate whether these cystatins correlate with diagnostic parameters of pleural and lung diseases, we determined their concentrations in 160 pleural effusions. The median concentration of cystatin C in pleural effusions was 1437 microg/l (95.8 nM), ranging between 18-3967 microg/l. Cystatin C did neither correlate with malignant nor with benign diseases. The concentration of cystatin E/M was significantly higher in effusions of primary pleural tumours (mesotheliomas) compared to secondary pleural tumours and benign diseases. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between the concentration of cystatin E/M of mesotheliomas and the pleural fluid tumour cell count and of cystatin C. The median values of cystatin F were significantly increased in parapneumonic/empyema thoracis pleural effusions and tuberculous pleurisy compared to malignant pleural effusions, respectively. The concentration of cystatin F in benign effusions correlated significantly with diagnostic parameters and inflammation (total protein lactate dehydrogenase
