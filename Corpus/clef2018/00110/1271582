Clinical use of gentamicin in the field of surgery (author's transl). Gentamicin (GM) was intramuscularly administered to 24 patients with various infections (including 1 for prophylaxis of a postoperative infection) in the dose of 40 mg X 2/day for 4-26 days. In children, the maximum daily dose was 3.4 mg/kg and the minimum was 1.2 mg/kg (mean: 2-3 mg/kg). The results obtained are as follows: 1) Clinical efficacy of GM was excellent in 2, good in 9, fair in 4, null in 4 and indeterminate in 5, out of 24 cases. The effective rate was 57.9% (11/19). 2) In 21 strains isolated in 13 cases out of 24, efficacy of GM was good in 10, fair in 5, null in 3 and indeterminate in 3. The effective rate was 55.6% (10/18). 3) No significant side effect was observed in this clinical study.
