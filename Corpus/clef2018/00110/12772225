Sputum induction as a diagnostic tool for community-acquired pneumonia in infants and young children from a high HIV prevalence area. Sputum induction is a standard diagnostic procedure to identify pathogens in lower respiratory tract secretions in adults with pneumonia, but has rarely been studied or used in infants and young children. Our aim was to determine the usefulness of induced sputum (IS) as a diagnostic method for infants and children hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in a high HIV prevalence area. Children hospitalized for CAP were prospectively enrolled over a year. IS was obtained by nebulization with hypertonic (5%) saline, physiotherapy, and suctioning. Sputum was submitted for bacterial and mycobacterial culture and P. carinii detection. Gastric lavages (GLs) were done for M. tuberculosis culture a nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) was obtained for bacterial culture and P. carinii detection. IS was obtained in 210 children (median age, 7 (25th to 75th percentile, 3-18) months)
