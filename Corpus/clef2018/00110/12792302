Community-acquired pneumonia in very elderly patients: causative organisms, clinical characteristics, and outcomes. We performed an observational analysis of prospectively collected data on 1,474 adult patients who were hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia 1,169 patients were under 80 years of age and 305 (21%) patients were over 80 years ("very elderly"). Mean patient ages were 60 years in the former group and 85 years in the latter group. Severely immunosuppressed patients and nursing-home residents were not included. Comorbidities significantly associated with older age were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic heart disease, and dementia. The most common causative organism was Streptococcus pneumoniae (23% in both groups). Aspiration pneumonia was more frequent in the very elderly (5% in younger patients versus 10% in the very elderly)
