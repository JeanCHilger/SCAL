Community acquired pneumococcal pneumonia in hospitalized adult patients. S pneumoniae is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia.To evaluate the clinical characteristics, antibiotic resistance, management and prognostic factors in pneumococcal pneumonia.Prospective evaluation in 46 adults (age +/- sd: 68 +/- 17 years) hospitalized with pneumococcal pneumonia confirmed by sputum, blood or pleural fluid cultures. Clinical and radiographic variables, risk factors for antibiotic resistance, and hospital mortality rate were recorded.Heart disease (39%), COPD/asthma (25%), and diabetes mellitus (18%) were the most frequent underlying diseases. None of the patients had previously received pneumococcal vaccine. Only 17% of the patients had the classic triad of chills, fever and productive cough. At admission, interestingly, 17% presented with congestive heart failure. Resistance of pneumococci to penicillin, cefotaxime or erythromycin was 15%, 6% and 11%, respectively. Antibiotic use prior to admission was significantly associated with antibiotic resistance (OR = 6 CI 95% = 1.1-32Our data suggest that pneumococcal pneumonia is still a severe infection with high mortality hence, efforts should be made at prevention using pneumococcal immunization.
