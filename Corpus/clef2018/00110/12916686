Clinical and laboratory study of newborns with lower respiratory tract infection due to respiratory viruses. To determine the prevalence of lower respiratory tract infection due to respiratory viruses in the neonatal period at admission to the neonatal intensive care unit and to compare the clinical, laboratory and radiological aspects of the clinical course, according to the etiological agent, in the neonatal period.Ninety newborns were studied, from January 1999 to January 2001, with bronchiolitis and/or pneumonia. The newborns were classified into three groups, according to the etiological agent identified initially: viral infection (group A), mixed viral-bacterial infection (group B), and bacterial infection (group C).The virus was identified in 72 newborns (80.0%) the most prevalent was respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (44.4%), followed by influenza A virus (22.2%). Coughing, wheezing and an interstitial infiltrate were significantly more frequent in newborns with viral infection. Mixed infection was more associated with sepsis. There was a correlation between viral infection and low values of initial and subsequent white blood cell count and C-reactive protein. RSV was the most important virus in these patients.It was observed that, although the majority of viral respiratory infections had a favorable course, some patients presented a serious and prolonged clinical manifestation, especially when there was concomitant bacterial infection.
