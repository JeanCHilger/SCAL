Causes of lamb morbidity and mortality in the Ethiopian highlands. A study was conducted to investigate causes of lamb morbidity and mortality on farms and on-station at Debre Berhan during 1989 and 1990. It showed pneumonia (bacterial and/or verminous), starvation-mismothering exposure (SME) complex, gastrointestinal parasites, enteritis, abomasal impaction and physical injuries to be important health constraints on productivity. Neonatal mortalities were 51.5% and 46.3% on farms and on-station respectively and occurred owing to management problems such as SME, abomasal impaction and physical injuries. On the farms the lamb birth weight was 2.56 +/- 0.25 kg and was significantly (p < 0.05) affected by the dam's age, lambing weight, litter size, sex of lamb and year of lambing, but not by the season of lambing. Birth weight significantly (p < 0.05) influenced lamb mortality. Lambs with a low birth weight tended to die from SME. Morbidities and mortalities due to infectious causes increased in older lambs, suggesting that infections were acquired with age when resistance was lowered owing to inadequate nutrition and poor management. Heavy loss of lambs could be overcome by such health management interventions as foster mothering, warming lambs during the cold season and vaccination with polyvalent vaccines against pasteurellosis, clostridial infection and Dictyocaulus filaria.
