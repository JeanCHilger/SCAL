Clinical use of the new macrolides, azalides, and streptogramins in pediatrics. Macrolides are the primary drugs of choice for a number of clinically significant infections in children. The clinical aspects of newer macrolides such as roxithromycin, clarithromycin, dirithromycin, flurithromycin, miocamycin, rokitamycin, azithromycin and RP 59500 are discussed in different pediatric infections including streptococcal infections (e.g. pharyngitis, otitis, pneumonia, skin infections), staphylococcus soft tissue infections, mycoplasma pneumonia, chlamydial infections as well as legionellosis and campylobacter enteritis. Also, incidences of adverse events in pediatric patients receiving different macrolides are indicated as well as the dosages in children. The advantages of newer macrolides are: lower dosages, b.i.d. or once daily dosage regimens, good intracellular and tissue penetration, better activity against gram-negative microorganisms (some) and a low rate of adverse reactions.
