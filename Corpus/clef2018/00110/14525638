Ventilator-associated pneumonia in intubated children: comparison of different diagnostic methods. To compare different methods for diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia in intubated children.Prospective epidemiologic study.Pediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary care university hospital.All consecutive pediatric intensive care unit patients <18 yrs of age with suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia.For all patients, the following diagnostic methods were compared: 1) clinical data using Centers for Disease Control criteria 2) blind protected bronchoalveolar lavage, evaluating quantitative cultures, bacterial index of >5, Gram stain, and presence of intracellular bacteriaA total of 30 patients were included in the study. According to the reference standard, ventilator-associated pneumonia occurred in 10 of 30 patients (33%). Bacterial index of >5 in bronchoalveolar secretions showed the best concordance compared with the reference standard (concordance, 83% kappa, 0.61). Bacterial index of >5 also showed the best validity (sensitivity, 78%Our data show that the most reliable diagnostic method for ventilator-associated pneumonia is a bacterial index of >5, using blind protected bronchoalveolar lavage. Further studies should evaluate the validity of all these methods according to the gold standard (autopsy).
