The interrelation of the immunity status and intestinal microbiocenosis in young children with acute respiratory organ diseases. The immune status and the state of intestinal microbiocenosis have been studied in 70 young children with acute respiratory diseases. As revealed in this study, in 85.7% of cases bronchopulmonary diseases are accompanied by disturbances in phasic fluctuations of the immune status and intestinal microbiocenosis. The possibility of repeated acute respiratory infections is predetermined by the intensity of manifestations of immune disturbances and intestinal dysbiocenosis, these two phenomena being directly interrelated. The use of eubiotics jointly with immunostimulants is proposed for the treatment of children with acute bronchopulmonary pathology combined with the unbalance of the immune status and intestinal dysbacteriosis.
