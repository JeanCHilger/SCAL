Analysis of possible causes of recurrent respiratory tract infections in children from Lodz, Poland. Recurrent respiratory tract infections are responsible for about 85% of all diseases in childhood. Early diagnosis helps to prevent infections and start the appropriate treatment, what in turn prevents lungs from irreversible damage. The aim of this study was the analysis of possible causes of recurrent respiratory tract infections in children in Lodz region. We analyzed cases of 6335 children with recurrent respiratory tract infections, age 3 months to 17 years, referred to the clinic in our hospital by family doctors from 2000 to 2002. Among all children, 41.5% were diagnosed with allergy, 26.9% of patients had persistent Mycoplasma pneumoniae and 1.4% Bordetella pertussis infection. Very disturbing was the fact of very late cystic fibrosis diagnose at the age of 7,11 and 16. Congenital immune disorders were diagnosed late in five children at the age of 6,7,8,9,11, what delayed appropriate therapy and early prevention of infections.
