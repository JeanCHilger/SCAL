Out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest in children with croup. Viral laryngotracheobronchitis is a ubiquitous infectious process that has not caused significant mortality in the past 20 years. Bacterial tracheitis and pneumonia can complicate viral laryngotracheobronchitis and markedly increase the risk of bad outcome. Even uncomplicated, properly managed, viral laryngotracheobronchitis can occasionally result in death, particularly in the infant age group.
