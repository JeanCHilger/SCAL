Feasibility of using a large Clinical Data Warehouse to automate the selection of diagnostic cohorts. Data from Clinical Data Warehouses (CDWs) can be used for retrospective studies and for benchmarking. However, automated identification of cases from large datasets containing data items in free text fields is challenging. We developed an algorithm for categorizing pediatric patients presenting with respiratory distress into Bronchiolitis, Bacterial pneumonia and Asthma using clinical variables from a CDW. A feasibility study of this approach indicates that case selection may be automated.
