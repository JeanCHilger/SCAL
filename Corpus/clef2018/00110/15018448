Amniotic sac infection syndrome features fetal lung neuroendocrine cell hyperfunction. Neuroendocrine cells (NEC) are abundant in fetal and neonatal lungs, but reduced in infants with hyaline membrane disease. Perinatal neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia (NCH) has been reported in the hypoplastic lung in diaphragmatic hernia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and Wilson-Mikity syndrome. Since we are unaware of any reports on NCH in fetal inflammatory conditions, this report addresses the NEC in fetuses with congenital pneumonia. Twenty-one fetuses/neonates with congenital pneumonia, autopsied between 1995 and 2001, were compared to 21 fetuses without a congenital infection matched for gestational age. Lung sections were immunostained for chromogranin, bombesin, calcitonin, and synaptophysin. Proportions of immunopositive cells lining 20 consecutive bronchioles calculated from digital images were significantly higher in the study than the control group for chromogranin (1.8 vs. 0.8%, P = 2.4 E-06), calcitonin (1.2 vs. 0.7%, P = 0.005), and bombesin (1.1 vs. 0.7%, P = 0.005). There was no difference in synaptophysin (11.7% vs. 12.6%, P = 0.07). The absence of significant differences in the synaptophysin ratio excludes simple NCH in the study group. The synchronous increase in three neurohormones is indicative of NEC hyperfunction, due to either altered enzymatic inactivation by neutral endopeptidase, known to be reduced in adult lung inflammation, or by an increase in expression of the neurohormone genes. These data indicate that NEC hyperfunction may be responsible for the deranged fetal/neonatal lung function and circulatory adaptation, and contribute to the lethality of the amniotic sac infection syndrome.
