Comparative epidemiological characteristics of a homogeneous series of acute common pneumopathies seen in a general hospital center (GHC). Between 1979 and 1989, 108 cases of community acquired pneumonia in non-immunodepressed subjects were admitted to hospital to a specialist chest department. The patient's characteristics were as follows: mean age = 56 (range 14-91), 44 women and 64 men. The causal agent was isolated in 44 cases (40%) of which 4 cases were viral (9% of 44 cases) and 12 were Legionella (27%), pneumococci (SP) 11 cases (25%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) 8 cases (18%), and Chlamydia 8 cases. The microbacteriological criteria for diagnosis were as follows: significant seroconversion for viruses, MP, Chlamydia, Legionella, bacteriological isolation on blood cultures, and pleural liquid for SP. In 64 cases the bacteriological diagnosis was not established. In this series we note as follows: 1) There did not appear to be any seasonal peak in relation to bacteria isolated, contrary to previous reports, in particular for Legionella. On the other hand viruses occur notably in February and March. 2) Chlamydia were more frequent in individuals living in rural areas 7 cases out of 8. Whereas amongst the 108 patients 55 were from the country and 34 from the city (16 from institutions and 3 uncertain). In conclusion, if the level of bacteriological identification (IMB) appears weaker than in previous reference series: 51-65%, the diagnostic yield clearly improved in our experience achieving results nearer to the best achievable: 54% of IMB from 48 cases which were recruited between 1985-1989.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
