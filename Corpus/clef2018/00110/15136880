Lipid peroxidation of lung surfactant in experimental neonatal group B streptococcal pneumonia. Group B streptococcal (GBS) pneumonia, with neutrophilic granulocytes immigrating into the lungs, may occur in neonates. The incidence is particularly high among preterm infants, who often are treated with exogenous surfactant. We have previously demonstrated in vitro that neutrophils stimulated by GBS cause lipid peroxidation (LPO) and functional impairment of lung surfactant. The present study aimed at evaluating LPO of exogenous lung surfactant (Curosurf) and the protective effect of the natural antioxidant, vitamin E in immature ventilated newborn rabbits with experimental neonatal GBS pneumonia. There was a prominent proliferation of GBS in the lungs of animals treated with surfactant and ventilated for 5 h. GBS-infected rabbits had a higher LPO of lung lavage fluid than non-infected ones. The LPO could be diminished using vitamin E, which, however, did not affect bacterial proliferation. During the 5-h incubation period, mean lung-thorax compliance values were significantly lower in GBS-infected than in noninfected animals. We speculate that addition of vitamin E to exogenous surfactant preparations may improve their resistance to LPO and make them more suitable for treatment of neonates with pneumonia.
