Pulmonary toxicity associated with high dose chemotherapy in the treatment of solid tumors with autologous marrow transplant: an analysis of four chemotherapy regimens. We retrospectively reviewed the pulmonary toxicity of six high dose chemotherapy protocols using four chemotherapy regimens in the treatment of solid tumors. All protocols used either high dose cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide in combination with one to three additional chemotherapeutic agents. In each protocol autologous bone marrow was reinfused post chemotherapy to shorten the period of severe myelosuppression. Of 178 patients there were 20 cases of fatal or life-threatening pulmonary toxicity including nine cases of pneumonia, nine cases of interstitial pneumonitis and two cases of pulmonary hemorrhage. Pulmonary function tests revealed modest changes in FEV1 and DLCO in the majority of patients, although 24 patients had more dramatic changes in DLCO suggesting interstitial damage. Significant decrements in FEV1 were seen in the BCNU containing regimen. Statistically significant or nearly significant decreases in DLCO were seen after all cyclophosphamide containing regimens. A regimen containing ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide had minimal associated pulmonary toxicity.
