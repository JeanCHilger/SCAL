Towards an integrated approach to lung health in adolescents in developing countries. The World Health Organization strategies, Integrated Management of Childhood Illness and Practical Approach to Lung health provide assessment and management guidelines for health workers in developing countries. We reviewed issues important to lung health in adolescents to highlight whether differences in factors such as adolescent behaviour have consequences for the development of case management guidelines, to form a bridge between guidelines for younger children and for adults and to make suggestions for further study. Pneumonia, asthma and tuberculosis are the leading lung health problems in adolescents. As countries industrialise, the importance of asthma mortality and morbidity increases as that of pneumonia and pulmonary tuberculosis decreases. Guidelines for managing pneumonia and asthma in children and adults in developing and developed countries should be adaptable for use in adolescents in developing countries, although more information is needed on predictors of severity such as respiratory rate cut-offs, level of fever, hypotension, malnutrition and level of consciousness. The effectiveness of low-cost treatment for asthma should be explored further. HIV and the global resurgence of tuberculosis pose significant challenges for improving adolescent lung health, and prevention of smoking initiation during adolescence is a priority goal of any integrated approach to improving lung health.
