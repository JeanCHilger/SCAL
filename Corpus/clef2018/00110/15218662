Typhoid fever in a child--a case report. We report a case of typhoid fever in an 8 years old boy. The child was initially admitted to a local hospital where pneumonia, myocarditis with heart failure, pyelonephritis, liver and pancreatic failure as well as cholelithiasis were suspected. Zinaceff and Amikin were administered and after 8 days the child was referred to the cardiology department of a regional reference hospital due to heart failure symptoms. There the diagnosis of sepsis was established, and the antibiotics changed to Pipril and Amikin. The child however did not improve and after two days he was transferred to an intensive care unit. The previous anti-microbial therapy was continued for another 7 days until the results of stool culture revealing Salmonella sp. were available. Subsequently the boy was admitted to our clinic. Based on the clinical course, Widal test and isolating of the Salmonella typhi from the stool samples typhoid fever was diagnosed.
