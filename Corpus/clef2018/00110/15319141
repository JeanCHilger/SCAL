Influence of admission procedure and hospitalization form on the value of magnesium concentration in serum, blood cells and urine in children hospitalizated due to pneumonia or obstructive bronchiolitis. Wide spectrum of biological properties of magnesium is very well documented in pathomechanism of large number of diseases, where increased stressogenic actions with simultaneous magnesium deficiency have been observed. Our paper describes researches on trials to find out the relationships between stress reaction and magnesium deficiency, admission procedure and hospitalization form of children with pneumonia or obstructive bronchiolitis. It has been shown that serum magnesium concentration before treatment of sick children that during hospitalization had contacted parents, was significantly lower and essentially increased in examinations after treatment. However, in both groups of ill children (that which had constant as well as sporadic contact with parents during hospitalization period) blood cell magnesium concentration was essentially lower before and significantly increased after treatment, and urine magnesium concentration was essentially higher before and significantly decreased after treatment.
