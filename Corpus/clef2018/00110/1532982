Sequelae of antireflux surgery in profoundly disabled children. Between 1976 and 1989 an antireflux operation (193 Nissen 5 Thal) was performed in 198 children with profound neurological impairment (NI). Etiology of the NI was a syndrome in 24%, congenital in 30%, and acquired in 46%. The most frequent symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux (GER), vomiting and pneumonia, were significantly reduced (P less than .05) after the antireflux operation. Postoperatively, 141 children (71%) developed return of one or more symptoms that had been preoperatively associated with GER, whereas 57 patients (29%) remained asymptomatic. Of the children with symptoms, 86 (61%) underwent diagnostic testing to exclude recurrent GER and 55 (39%) had no diagnostic evaluation. Recurrent GER was documented in 31 patients and a mechanical problem with the fundoplication in 18 children, an operative failure rate of 25%. The symptom-free interval following the antireflux operation averaged 11 months postoperatively
