Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in a child after renal transplantation. Although Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections are common among school children and young adults, they have been rarely reported in renal transplant recipients. Herein, we report an 8-yr-old boy who had M. pneumoniae infection 1 yr after transplantation and showed liver dysfunction during the course of the disease. In children who underwent renal transplantation and receive immunosuppressive treatment, we suggest that symptoms of a simple upper respiratory tract infection may precede M. pneumoniae disease with potentially serious extrapulmonary complications.
