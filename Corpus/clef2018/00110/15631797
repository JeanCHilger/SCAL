Comparative study on cefdinir and cefaclor in the treatment of patients with mild to moderate bacterial community acquired pneumonia. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of cefdinir in the treatment of patients with mild to moderate bacterial community acquired pneumonia (CAP).A prospective single-blind randomized controlled clinical study was performed comparing cefdinir with cefaclor in the treatment of sixty-four patients with CAP. The clinical and bacteriological efficacy and safety were compared between cefdinir and cefaclor in treating mild to moderate CAP. Thirty-three patients were treated with cefdinir 100 mg, orally, three times a day (cefdinir group), thirty-one patients were treated with cefaclor 500 mg, orally, three times a day (cefaclor group). In both groups 7-14 d was a treatment course.The cure rate of cefdinir and cefaclor was 84.8% and 77.4% respectively and the overall efficacy rate was 93.9% and 87.1% respectively. The bacterial positive rates and bacterial eradication rates of the two groups were 81.8%, 80.7% and 96.3%, 88%, respectively. The adverse drug reaction rate were 3% in cefdinir group and 6.5% in cefaclor group. There was no statistical significant difference between the two groups for the above results (P >0.05). The time of given medicine of cefdinir and cefaclor was (10.8 +/- 1.6) d and (12.1 +/- 1.7) d (P <0.01) respectively.cefdinir is safe and effective, shorten the course of treatment in the treatment of mild to moderate bacterial community acquired pneumonia.
