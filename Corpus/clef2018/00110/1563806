Dose-dependent rate of nosocomial pulmonary infection in mechanically ventilated patients with brain oedema receiving barbiturates: a prospective case study. In a prospective case study we investigated whether the application of barbiturates in artificially ventilated patients with brain oedema has dose-dependent effects on the rate of nosocomial pneumonia.
