Ventilator-associated pneumonia in a newborn intensive care unit. A prospective observational study was conducted in a neonatal intensive care unit to identify factors associated with the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in 170 infants aged less than 30 days who required mechanical ventilation for longer than 48 hours. VAP occurred in 85 infants (50 cases per 100 mechanically-ventilated infants) or 70.3 cases per 1,000 ventilator days. Stepwise logistic regression analysis identified 3 factors independently associated with VAP: umbilical catheterization [adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=2.5 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.3 to 4.7
