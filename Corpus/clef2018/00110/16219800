Stem cell transplantation with reduced-intensity conditioning for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is curative for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). However, patients frequently have significant morbidity before transplantation and there is high transplant-related mortality (TRM). Because first-degree HLH is caused by immune dysregulation, a reduced-intensity conditioned (RIC) regimen might be sufficient for cure while decreasing the TRM. Twelve patients with HLH underwent RIC SCT from a matched family/unrelated or haploidentical donor. Eleven were conditioned with fludarabine/melphalan with additional busulphan for haploidentical grafts. One received fludarabine and 2-Gy total body irradiation (TBI). All patients showed engraftment at a median of 14 days. Nine of 12 (75%) are alive and in complete remission (CR) a median of 30 months (range, 9-73 months) after SCT. Two patients died from pneumonitis and one from hepatic rupture. Four patients developed acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and 3 have chronic GVHD. Three of 9 survivors have mixed chimerism but remain free of disease. In summary, RIC compares favorably to conventional SCT with long-term disease control in surviving patients despite a significant incidence of mixed chimerism.
