Intensive care unit-acquired infections: incidence, risk factors and associated mortality in a Turkish university hospital. In this prospective study, 93 intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired infections seen in 131 ICU patients were evaluated. Infection rates were found to be 70.9 in 100 patients and 56.2 in 1,000 patient-days. Pneumonia (35.4%) and bloodstream infections (18.2%) were the most common infections Staphylococcus aureus (30.9%) and Acinetobacter spp. (26.8%) were the most frequently isolated microorganisms. The results of multivariate logistic regression analyses estimating the risk factors for ICU-acquired infections were as follows: length of stay in ICU (>7 days) (odds ratio [OR]: 7.02
