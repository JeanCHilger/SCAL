Diagnosis and investigation of bacterial pneumonias. This overview has been supported by a review of the literature referring to the management of community-acquired pneumonia (in preparation). Difficulties diagnosing bacterial pneumonia include identifying the pathogens and the validation of radiographic signs suggesting bacterial or mycoplasmal infection. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has published guidelines for diagnosis which seem to be as relevant for developed as developing countries. The main diagnostic features are tachypnoea, fever greater than 38.5 degrees C and chest recession without wheeze. Radiographic features lag behind clinical findings and provide little additional help when antibiotic treatment is considered but are crucial in the proper management of complications.
