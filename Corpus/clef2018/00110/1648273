Interrelationship between lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid and pulmonary blood flow and ventilation in acute pneumonia. High-pressure liquid chromatography was used to measure the blood content of lipoxygenase metabolites (LM) of arachidonic acid: leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and hydroxyeicosatetraene acids (5 HETE, 12 HETE, 15 HETE) in 65 patients with acute pneumonia (AP) of mild gravity (group 1) and of medium gravity (group 2), in 23 patients with acute bronchitis (AB), and in 15 normal male persons aged 18 to 20 years. In all the examined, the zonal pulmonary blood flow was measured by regional rheopulmonography. External respiratory function (ERF) was also determined together with the recording of the flow-volume loop. At the height of AP and AB, all the patients demonstrated an increase of LM in the blood, with the maximum LM content being recorded in group 2. During convalescence, AB and AP patients of group 1 manifested normalization of the majority of the parameters. In group 2, they significantly exceeded the control level. 5 and 15 HETE had the closest correlations with the blood flow parameters, whereas LTB4 and 12 HETE had less intensive correlations. The influences of LM such as 5 and 15 HETE on the pulmonary blood flow were associated with deterioration of the blood content of the lungs and venous return, the action of LTB4 was coupled with venous congestion formation, that of 12 HETE with the rise of vascular resistance. Close negative correlations of LTB4 and 5 HETE with the majority of ERF parameters indicate that they are important factors in the pathogenesis of restrictive and obstructive ventilatory disorders.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
