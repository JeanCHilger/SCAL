Simplified treatment of acute lower respiratory tract infection with azithromycin: a comparison with erythromycin and amoxycillin. European Azithromycin Study Group. In two randomized, multicentre studies azithromycin treatment (1.5 g in five or six doses over 5 days) was compared with erythromycin treatment (14 or 20 g in 28 or 40 doses over 7 or 10 days) and amoxycillin treatment (10.5 g in 21 doses over 7 days) in patients with acute respiratory tract infection. In the two separate studies, azithromycin gave complete clinical cure in 70% and 51%, respectively, of patients compared with in 60% of erythromycin- and 45% of amoxycillin-treated patients. Eradication of the main pathogens isolated at baseline (Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus) was comparable in the azithromycin, erythromycin and amoxycillin treatment groups. Efficacy was not affected by the presence or absence of underlying pulmonary disease. There were no major abnormalities in laboratory safety parameters and adverse events, principally mild/moderate gastro-intestinal symptoms occurred in 5% or 15%, respectively, of azithromycin-treated patients compared with in 18% or 17%, respectively, of those receiving erythromycin or amoxycillin. It is concluded that azithromycin was as effective and better tolerated than erythromycin or amoxycillin.
