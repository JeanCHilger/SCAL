Nosocomial pulmonary Rhizopus diagnosed by bronchoalveolar lavage with cytology in a child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Rhizopus species is an opportunistic fungus that is contracted by inhalation of aerosolized spores. Early diagnosis is often difficult but is a necessity to prevent rapid progression of the infection that leads to blood vessel invasion by hyphae, causing fatal hemoptysis. A previous case report described the utility of cytologic examination of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid in achieving a prompt diagnosis of Rhizopus species in an adolescent patient with diabetic ketoacidosis. The author presents a case that further describes the benefit of performing BAL fluid cytology to help identify fungal morphology characteristics in order to reach an expeditious diagnosis of Rhizopus species in a leukemia patient.
