Comparative evaluation of empirical antibacterial therapy for ventilator-associated pneumonia. The problem of nosocomial pneumonias remains most urgent for intensive care units so far. Particular emphasis is placed on clinical and diagnostic monitoring and therapy for ventilation-induced nosocomial pneumonias (VINP) in intensive care patients on ventilation. This is accounted for by not only the high incidence of this pathology, but also by its severity and mortality rates. In the pattern of nosocomial complications, pneumonia ranks second-third in its prevalence, which accounts for about 10-15%, and first in mortality rates (30%) it afflicts 50% of the elderly patients on ventilation. Antibacterial therapy plays a great role in ventilation therapy. The study deals with the comparative characteristics of empirical antibacterial therapy for VINP.
