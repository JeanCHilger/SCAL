A young infant with afebrile pneumonia caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. Pregnant women who have an urogenital Chlamydia trachomatis infection may transmit the infection to their infants. Conjunctivitis and nasopharyngeal infection are the most frequent manifestations. Less frequently the infants may develop pneumonia. We report a case of a 5-week-old girl with poor feeding, staccato cough and clinical signs of pneumonia. Chest radiography revealed severe bronchopneumonia. Despite of intravenous therapy with ampicillin and gentamicin respiration deteriorated and oxygen supplementation became necessary. After additional treatment with oral erythromycin (50 mg/kg per day) had been started the clinical condition improved. Polymerase chain reaction with a nasopharyngeal specimen was found to be positive for Chlamydia trachomatis.
