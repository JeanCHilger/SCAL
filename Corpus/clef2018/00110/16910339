Non-resolving pneumonia in a young boy--beware of foreign body aspiration. A 4 1/2-year-old boy presented with recurrent cough and cold of 2 years duration. Chest x-ray revealed collapse consolidation of right lower lobe. Rigid bronchoscopy was done and the nozzle of a pen was extracted from right main bronchus. The radiological improvement took three months after extraction of the foreign body. Undetected foreign body aspiration is one of the causes of nonresolving pneumonia in children.
