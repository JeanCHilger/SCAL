Ready for the frontline: is early thoracoscopic decortication the new standard of care for advanced pneumonia with empyema? Video-assisted thoracoscopic decortication (VATD) has been established as an effective and potentially less morbid alternative to open thoracotomy for the management of empyema. However, the timing and role of VATD for advanced pneumonia with empyema is still controversial. In assessing surgical outcome, the authors reviewed their VATD experience in children with empyema or empyema with necrotizing pneumonia. The charts of 42 children who underwent VATD at our institution between July 2001 and July 2005 were retrospectively reviewed for surgical outcome. For purposes of analysis, patients were cohorted into four classes with increasing severity of pneumonia: 1 (-) intraoperative pleural fluid cultures, (-) necrotizing pneumonia, 18 (43%) 2 (+) pleural fluid cultures, (-) necrotizing pneumonia, 10 (24%)
