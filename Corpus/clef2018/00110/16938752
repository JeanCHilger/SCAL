Effect of aerosolized rhDNase (Pulmozyme) on pulmonary colonization in patients with cystic fibrosis. Aerosolized recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (rhDNase I (Pulmozyme)) has previously been shown to increase pulmonary function and reduce exacerbations of respiratory symptoms in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with moderate to severe reduction in pulmonary function.To analyse whether aerosolized Pulmozyme could reduce the number of bacterial infections in the lower respiratory airways of CF patients without chronic pulmonary infection.Patients were randomized either to aerosolized Pulmozyme 2(1/2) mg once daily or to no rhDNase treatment. The study period was 1 y, and the study was blinded for the Department of Clinical Microbiology.Overall, the number of positive cultures was significantly higher in the untreated group (82%) compared with the treated group (72%) (p<0.05). The most striking difference was found for Staphylococcus aureus, with a prevalence of 30% in the untreated group compared with 16% in the treated group (chi2 test, p<0.0001). Pulmonary function (FEV1) in the treated group showed a significant increase of 7.3% compared to 0.9% in the untreated group (p<0.05).Long-term DNase treatment was beneficial to CF patients without chronic lower respiratory tract infection, leading to reduced demand for antibiotics and to improved lung function.
