Pneumonia during pregnancy. We determined the incidence, clinical course, risk factors, and outcomes of community-acquired pneumonia complicating pregnancy.A prospective study was performed of pregnant and nonpregnant patients in the same age range who presented to any of 6 hospitals in Edmonton, Alberta, with signs and symptoms of pneumonia together with an acute infiltrate evident on chest radiography compatible with pneumonia.There were 28 patients with pneumonia during pregnancy, for an incidence of 1.1 per 1000 deliveries, whereas there were 333 nonpregnant females in the 20- to 40-year age group with pneumonia, for an incidence of 1.3 per 1000. No significant differences in signs and symptoms were present between the two groups. Asthma requiring treatment was present in 46.4% of the pregnant patients, compared with 17.1% of the nonpregnant patients. No maternal or fetal deaths were noted except an abortion at 10 weeks of gestation. No anomaly was detected among newborns. Two patients had preterm deliveries.Pneumonia is well tolerated during pregnancy. Asthma may be a predisposing factor for pneumonia in this group of patients.
