Prevalence and clinical features of mycoplasma pneumoniae in Thai children. To determine the prevalence and clinical features of mycoplasma pneumoniae in Thai children with community acquired pneumonia (CAP).Diagnosis of current infection was based on > or = 4 fold rise in antibody sera or persistently high antibody titers together with the presence of mycoplasma DNA in respiratory secretion. The clinical features were compared between children who tested positive for M pneumoniae, and those whose results were negative.Current infection due to M. pneumoniae was diagnosed in 36 (15%) of 245 children with paired sera. The sensitivity and specificity of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in diagnosing current infection in the present study were 78% and 98% respectively. The mean age of children with mycoplasma pneumoniae was higher than CAP with unspecified etiology. The presenting manifestations and initial laboratory finding were insufficient to predict mycoplasma pneumoniae precisely, the presence of chest pain and lobar consolidation on chest X-ray, however, were significant findings in children with mycoplasma pneumoniae.The present study confirms that M. pneumoniae plays a significant role in CAP in children of all ages. Children with this infection should be identified in order to administer the appropriate antibiotic treatment.
