Dynamics of the cytologic and bacterioscopic changes in bronchoalveolar washings in acute focal pneumonia. The authors analyze cytologic and bacterioscopic changes in bronchoalveolar washings in 37 patients with acute focal pneumonia on days 4 through 44 of the disease. Bronchoalveolar washings obtained from 11 subjects without pulmonary conditions were examined for control. Immunofluorescent examination of brush biopsy specimens of the bronchial epithelium from 4 patients, taken at the peak of pneumonia, has revealed respiratory viruses antigens. The highest numbers of free bacterial colonies and intracellular bacteria were detectable also at the peak of pneumonia. In contrast to reference specimens, patients' bronchoalveolar washings were characterized by elevated absolute counts of the neutrophils, bronchoepitheliocytes, and destroyed cells during the peak and regress of the disease. During convalescence these cell counts were essentially reducing though persisting significantly elevated as against the control. Absolute counts of alveolar macrophages and lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar washings were virtually unchanged over the course of the disease. The authors claim that the cytologic and bacterioscopic characteristics of bronchoalveolar washings objectively and fully reflect the activity of the inflammatory reaction in the lungs.
