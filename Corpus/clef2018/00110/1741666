Structural-functional characteristics of phagocytes in the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid in acute focal pneumonia. The alveolar macrophages and neutrophils of the bronchoalveolar fluid from 37 patients with acute focal pneumonia were studied cytochemically. A comparison group consisted of 20 patients with primary chronic bronchitis, 11 subjects without pulmonary affections served control. Phagocytes with a high motile, oxygen-dependent bactericidal and hydrolytic activity as well as with increased level of absorptive capacity prevailed during the peak of the disease and its regression. At the phase of convalescence the number of phagocytes with a high oxygen-dependent bactericidal and hydrolytic activity decreased but their high absorptive activity was retained.
