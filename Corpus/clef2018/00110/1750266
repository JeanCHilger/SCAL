Immune function risk factors for acute lower respiratory tract infections. The immune response of pneumonia patients and controls to Streptococcus pneumoniae was investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Patients less than 6 months of age had significantly lower levels of anti-pneumococcal polysaccharide antibodies than their age-matched controls. Patients and controls 6-14 months of age had lower antibody levels than the children 0-5 months of age. Adult patients and controls did not differ in their antibody status. However, patients and Papua New Guinean controls had depressed cell-mediated immunity and low T-cell numbers. Low levels of antibodies to pneumococcal polysaccharides in children less than 6 months of age appear to be an important risk factor for acute lower respiratory tract infections but other factors may be important in older infants and adults.The immune response of pneumonia patients and controls to Streptococcus  pneumoniae was investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  (ELISA).
