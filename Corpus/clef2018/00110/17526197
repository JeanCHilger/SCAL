Bronchial capacity in community-acquired pneumonia. To examine bronchial capacity (BC) in patients with community pneumonia (CP) by speed characteristics of pulmonary ventilation function (PVF) and bronchial resistance (Raw).Monitoring of a peak expiration speed (PES) was made in 99 CP patients. In addition, 46 of them have undergone spirometry and bodyplethysmography (Masterlab pro device) with measurement of airflow speed, Raw and structure of total lung capacity.In 88.9% patients with CP the initial PES was subnormal but its normalization occurred (in 79.7%) within 3 days of stable normalization of body temperature. This was confirmed by a strong negative correlation between the initial PES and body temperature in admission of CP patients to hospital (r = -0.73, p = 0.001). Raw in 86.9% patients with CP is normal (74.53 +/- 4.50%) both in moderate and acute fall of PVF speed characteristics. If these characteristics in CP patients are low, Raw should be examined. High Raw in this case justifies the diagnosis of latent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Raw in 86.9% CP patients is normal, thus indicating no impairment of bronchial capacity. Obstructive disorder of lung ventilation in acute CP detected at spirometry is explained by non-pulmonary causes. For diagnosis of BC affection in patients with CP and low speed characteristics of PVF, bronchial resistance must be examined. High bronchial resistance in such cases indicates latent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
