Recurrent pneumonia revealing a bronchial carcinoid tumor: report of two cases. Carcinoid tumors are the most common endobronchial tumor in the pediatric population, and represent a rare cause of airway obstruction. The authors report two cases of boys aged 10 and 11 years old, who presented with a 12-month history of recurrent pneumonia. Bronchial endoscopy showed an endobronchial tumor. Chest CT-scan identified local extension and lung-associated lesions octreoscan was performed to detect distant metastases. Histopathological study concluded in typical carcinoid tumor. The outcome after surgical conservative resection is uneventful with a follow-up of 7 and 26 months. Bronchial tumors must be considered in children with recurrent pneumonia or persistant respiratory symptoms, and require CT scan and bronchial endoscopy for their diagnosis.
