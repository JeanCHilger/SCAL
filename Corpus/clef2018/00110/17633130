A comparison of radiographic signs of pulmonary inflammation during ECMO between silicon and poly-methyl pentene oxygenators. The inflammatory response caused by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is clearly visible within the first 24 h of cannulation. The inflammatory process affects all areas of the lung, even areas previously spared by the primary disease.To compare the change in the radiographic signs of inflammatory response to ECMO between poly-methyl pentene and silicon oxygenators.Retrospective review of neonates and adults pre- and post-replacement of silicon oxygenators with poly-methyl pentene devices. Data were collected from Extracorporeal Life Support Organisation (ELSO) registry forms and patient records. Results were analysed by quantitative and semi-quantitative methods.There was a significant reduction in the radiographic signs of inflammatory response to ECMO, and a reduction in the time taken to revert to pre-ECMO state in the neonatal poly-methyl pentene group compared to silicon. However, there was no significant reduction in the duration of ECMO runs and the percentage survival between these groups in the neonates. In adults, there was no difference in severity of radiographic signs between groups. However, the inflammatory changes were relatively delayed in the adult poly-methyl pentene group.Polymethyl pentene (Medos) oxygenators have reduced the host's response phenomenon 'white out' in neonates, and caused a delayed response in adults. This is most likely a consequence of smaller blood contact surface area combined with the effect of heparin coating of the oxygenator membrane. However, recovery was not a function of the type of gas exchange device used.
