Relationship between soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and severe pneumonia. It has been reported that soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) participates in many immune and inflammatory reactions. Its expression and role in severe pneumonia has not fully been understood. This study aimed to investigate the changes of sICAM-1 expression in severe pneumonia and the relationship between sICAM-1 and severe pneumonia in children.Serum sICAM-1 levels were determined by the double antibody sand using ELISA in 50 children with severe pneumonia and 56 children with mild pneumonia. Fifty-two healthy children served as control group.Serum sICAM-1 levels in children with severe pneumonia (402.36 +/- 31.24 mu g/L) were remarkably higher than those in the mild pneumonia group (278.86 +/- 36.24 mu g/L) at the acute stage and higher than in the control group (180.74 +/- 21.46 mu g/L) (P < 0.01). Serum sICAM-1 levels in children with severe pneumonia decreased significantly at the recovery stage (198.56 +/- 12.63 mu g/L) (P < 0.01), which were not statistically different from those in the mild pneumonia group at the recovery stage and the control group. There were no significant differences in serum sICAM-1 levels among the severe pneumonia subgroups caused by different pathogens (bacteria, virus or Mycoplasma) at the acute stage. Serum sICAM-1 levels at the acute stage in children with severe pneumonia who were treated successfully were not significantly different from those in patients whose symptoms were partly improved.sICAM-1 might be involved in the inflammation course of severe pneumonia. It can severe as a marker of the diagnosis and the severity evaluation of severe pneumonia.
