Respiratory infections: pneumonia, lung abscess, and empyema. Pneumonia is an important clinical problem that affects children of all ages. Although effectively treated on an outpatient basis in the majority of cases, some children with respiratory infections still require hospitalization. This may be particularly true for patients with immunocompromise, for whom the lung represents the most common site of infection. Furthermore, respiratory infections represent a significant source of morbidity and mortality in this patient population. This article focuses on the clinical presentation, etiology, and treatment of childhood pneumonia, with special consideration given to the immunocompromised child. Two specific complications of pneumonia, lung abscess and empyema, are discussed.
