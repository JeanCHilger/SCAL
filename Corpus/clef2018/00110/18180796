Clinical relevance of TLR2, TLR4, CD14 and FcgammaRIIA gene polymorphisms in Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia and a major cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. It has been a major research priority to identify gene polymorphisms responsible for/associated with susceptibility and severity of S. pneumoniae infection to gain a better understanding of host genetic variants and their influence and clinical relevance to pneumococcal infections. In the present study, polymorphisms in several candidate genes, including TLR2-Arg/Gln753, TLR4-Asp/Gly299, TLR4-Thr/Ile399, CD14-159C/T and FcgammaRIIA-R/H131, were examined in 85 children with pneumococcal sepsis as an invasive pneumococcal disease and 409 healthy blood donors as controls. The prevalence of the TLR4-299/399 polymorphisms was significantly lower in the patient population than in controls (4 vs 11% P<0.05
