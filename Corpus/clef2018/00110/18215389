Parotid pneumocele in Down's syndrome. Pneumoparotiditis is related to the cause of an infrequent increase in the size of the parotid gland due to the entrance of air through the Stenon duct following an increase in the pressure in the oral cavity. It is observed in musicians who play wind instruments, glass blowers, patients undergoing diagnostic or therapeutic techniques, in adolescents that provoke it intentionally, and in mentally handicapped people as found in the clinical case reported here. The symptoms are usually non-specific and the diagnosis is confirmed with an axial tomography. The interest in this clinical case lies in the peculiar form of presentation and its diagnostic confirmation through the use of CT imaging.
