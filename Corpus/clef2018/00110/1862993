Hyperbaric oxygenation and antioxidants in the complex intensive therapy of severe forms of pneumonia in children. Hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) was used in a complex intensive therapy of 194 children, aged 3 days to 3 years, with severe pneumonias. Initially the patients have revealed intensification of free radical processes (FRP) with a simultaneous decrease in the level of enzyme and non-enzyme protection and a drastic increase in gluco- and mineralocorticoid adrenal function. HBO and antioxidants (unithiol and alpha-tocopherol) yielded excellent and good results (a drop in FRP level and activation of enzyme antioxidant protection) in 75.8% of patients. HBO was ineffective in 17% of cases, in 7.2% of patients signs of the developing oxygen intoxication have been revealed. Control over the indexes of erythrocytes resistance to peroxide, extra-erythrocyte hemoglobin, total peroxidase plasma activity during HBO procedure makes it possible to detect early preclinical signs of acute oxygen intoxication onset.
