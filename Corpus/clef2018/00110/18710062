Mycoplasma pneumoniae encephalitis in immunocompetent child. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia, but this organism can also affect almost every organ system besides the lung. Neurological manifestations (meningitis, encephalitis, transverse myelitis, Guillain-Barr√® syndrome) are the most frequent extrapulmonary complications of Mycoplasma pneumoniae. We report a case of a immunocompetent child affected by encephalitis caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae.
