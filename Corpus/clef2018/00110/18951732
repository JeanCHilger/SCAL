The effects of surfactant and antenatal corticosteroid treatment on the pulmonary pathology of preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of antenatal steroid treatment and/or postnatal surfactant replacement therapy on the incidence and extent of selected histopathological findings. Seventy complete autopsies were reviewed, and only lung tissues were examined and graded. Infants were divided into treatment and control groups as follows: group 1: surfactant-treated infants (n=15) group 2: infants whose mothers were given steroid treatment (n=16)
