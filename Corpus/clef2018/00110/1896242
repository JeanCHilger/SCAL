Recurrent respiratory infections in a child with fucosidosis: is the mucus too thin for effective transport? Fucosidosis is caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-L-fucosidase (ALF) leading to an accumulation of glycoproteins in a variety of cells. Infants and young children with this disorder are prone to recurrent sinus and pulmonary infections and often die of pneumonia. We studied the mucociliary and systemic immune function in a 6 year old girl with fucosidosis and recurrent respiratory infections. All measurements of systemic immune function were normal. Sweat chloride was normal when measured on angiokeratotic skin but was greater than 65 mg/L on uninvolved areas. During the placement of tympanic ventilation tubes, tracheal mucus was gently aspirated and a mucosal biopsy was taken. Tracheal mucus transport was not measured. The biopsy material was examined under phase contrast microscopy and revealed ciliated cells with apparently normal beating. TEM of these cells showed a characteristic pattern of vacuoles in the cytoplasm as described in other tissues from patients with fucosidosis. Ciliary ultrastructure was normal. Mucus viscoelasticity was measured in a magnetic microrheometer. The loss tangent was 2 SD above the mean for normal mucus and mechanical impedance was about 2 SD below the mean. These changes are similar in direction but double in magnitude to what has been described with methacholine administration in dogs. The high compliance of the mucus may be due to incomplete assembly of mucus glycoprotein or to decreased secretion of glycoproteins in respiratory secretions. This leads to mucus that is abnormally watery and thus difficult to clear from the airway.
