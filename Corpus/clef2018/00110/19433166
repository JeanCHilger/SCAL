Use of transanastomotic feeding tubes during esophageal atresia repair. Esophageal atresia (EA) with tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) type C accounts for 85% of all EA. In our center, patients were previously started on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) postoperatively and oral feedings initiated only after a contrast esophagogram. Our aim is to assess the benefit of intraoperatively placed transanastomotic feeding tubes (TAFTs).A 7-year retrospective review analyzed the outcomes of children with EATEF type C as they relate to the use of TAFT. Demographics, associated anomalies, operative findings, complications, duration of TPN, resumption of oral feeding, length of stay, and follow-up were examined.Twenty-one patients had EATEF type C. Eleven (55%) and 9 (45%) patients were identified as nonfeeding tube (NFT) and TAFT groups, respectively. There were no differences in gestational age, birth weight, associated anomalies, and interval to operative intervention or operative time. Excluding one patient with a severe cardiac malformation in the NFT group, there were no significant differences in anastomotic leak (8% vs 22%), stenosis (36% vs 22%), TPN duration (20 days vs 12 days), and cholestasis (36% vs 11%).Transanastomotic feeding tube may lead to shorter TPN duration and decreased cholestasis, but a larger prospective study would be required to prove these benefits and ensure that it does not increase anastomotic leaks. This could be done through an expanded Canadian Pediatric Surgery Network study.
