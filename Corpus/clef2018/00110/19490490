Chronic Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in a child after renal transplantation. Mycoplasma pneumoniae has rarely been reported in renal transplant recipients. We present the case of a 10-yr-old boy with a six-month history of chronic cough, recurrent pyrexia, and weight loss three yr after RTx. The patient's post-transplant course was complicated by recurrence of NS that resolved with plasmapheresis and PTLD, which was successfully treated with an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody. Chest X-ray showed a round mass-like lesion in the left upper lobe MRT, PET, and bronchoscopy ruled out a PTLD. BAL fluid revealed M. pneumoniae-DNA. A three-wk course of macrolide therapy induced rapid recovery. We conclude that M. pneumoniae infection should be considered in immunosuppressed patients with long-lasting respiratory complaints and fever of unknown origin. Antibiotic treatment should be given for a minimum of three wk.
