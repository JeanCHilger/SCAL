Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection associated with pancytopenia: a case report. Immune hemolytic anemia is a rare condition in childhood. Cold agglutinins have been implicated in the etiology of the hemolysis and frequently observed during Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections. We present here a case of cold agglutinin-related hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia secondary to M. pneumoniae associated pneumonia. It is suggested that even though very rare, M. pneumoniae infection should be considered as the underlying disease in a patient presenting with pancytopenia.
