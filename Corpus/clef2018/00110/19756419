Continuous vs thrice-daily ceftazidime for elective intravenous antipseudomonal therapy in cystic fibrosis. We hypothesized that a continuous 24-h infusion of 100 mg/kg per day ceftazidime (treatment C) would result in equivalent or even superior anti-infectious efficacy in chronic Pseudomonus aeruginosa (PA) infection in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) in comparison to the usual application of 200 mg/kg per day ceftazidime in three doses (treatment T).This was a randomized crossover study comparing outcome after 14 days and 35 days. Tobramycin administered once daily (10 mg/kg per day) was administered concomitantly in both groups. The primary end-point was a decrease in the leukocyte count, and the secondary endpoints were clinical and lung function parameters, Pseudomonas quantification in sputum, and inflammation markers (immunogloblulin [Ig] G, C-reactive protein [CRP]) in serum. All patients received antibiotics electively as 14-day courses on a regular basis, not for acute exacerbations.Fifty-six patients (29 females, mean patient age 14.4 years, age range 5-37) initially received treatments C or T, followed by the alternative treatment after a mean interval of 37 (+/- 21) weeks. After 2 weeks of antibiotic treatment, the overall study group showed significant improvements compared to baseline for body weight, leukocyte counts, CRP, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)), FVC (forced vital capacity), and bacterial load in the airways, with no significant differences between treatment groups. Both regimens were well tolerated. Three weeks after cessation of antimicrobial therapy, leukocytes and PA density had returned to pre-treatment values.We conclude that continuous or thrice-daily dosing of intravenous ceftazidime, both combined with once-daily tobramycin, are equally effective application regimens for elective antipseudomonal therapy in clinically stable patients with CF.
