Prevalence and risk factors of suppurative complications in children with pneumonia. To identify the baseline characteristics associated with suppurative complications in children with community-acquired primary pneumonia.A retrospective study included all children from 28 days to 15 years old, who presented with community-acquired pneumonia at two French hospitals from 1995 to 2003. Complicated pneumonia was defined by the presence of empyema and/or lung abscess.Of 767 children with community-acquired pneumonia, 90 had suppurative complications: 83 cases of pleural empyema and seven cases of lung abscess. The mean prevalence of complicated pneumonia was 3% during the 1995-1998 period, and then steadily increased following a linear trend to reach 23% in 2003. Children with complicated pneumonia were older and had a longer symptomatic period preceding hospitalization. They were more likely to receive antibiotics, especially aminopenicillins (p < 0.01), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, especially ibuprofen (p < 0.001). In multivariable analysis, ibuprofen was the only preadmission therapy that was independently associated with complicated pneumonia [adjusted OR = 2.57 (1.51-4.35)].This study confirms an association between the use of prehospital ibuprofen and suppurative pneumonic complications.
