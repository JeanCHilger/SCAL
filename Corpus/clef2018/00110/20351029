Repaired oesophageal atresia: respiratory morbidity and pulmonary function in adults. Although after oesophageal atresia (OA) repair in infancy, respiratory problems are common, their natural history remains unclear. We assessed morbidity, pulmonary function (PF), and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) in adults with repaired OA respiratory. 588 patients who underwent surgery for OA during 1947-1985 were identified and those 262 who were alive and had their native oesophagus were included. Respiratory symptoms and respiratory symptom-related quality of life (RSRQoL) were assessed by questionnaire and interview, and the patients underwent spirometry, a histamine challenge test, and an exhaled nitric oxide test. For the questionnaires, we added 287 carefully matched general population-derived controls. Among the 101 (58 male) patients, median age 36 yrs (range 22-56 yrs), respiratory morbidity was significantly increased compared to controls. Patients had more respiratory symptoms and infections, as well as asthma and allergies, and more often impaired RSRQoL (p<0.001 for all). PF tests revealed restrictive ventilatory defect in 21 (21%) patients, obstructive ventilatory defect in 21 (21%) patients, and both in 36 (36%) patients. A total of 41 (41%) had BHR, and in 15 (15%), it was consistent with asthma. The most significant risk factors for restrictive ventilatory defect were thoracotomy-induced rib fusions (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.3-8.7 p = 0.01) and oesophageal epithelial metaplasia (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.0-8.9
