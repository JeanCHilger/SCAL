Population pharmacokinetics of doripenem based on data from phase 1 studies with healthy volunteers and phase 2 and 3 studies with critically ill patients. A population pharmacokinetic model of doripenem was constructed using data pooled from phase 1, 2, and 3 studies utilizing nonlinear mixed effects modeling. A 2-compartment model with zero-order input and first-order elimination best described the log-transformed concentration-versus-time profile of doripenem. The model was parameterized in terms of total clearance (CL), central volume of distribution (V(c)), peripheral volume of distribution (V(p)), and distribution clearance between the central and peripheral compartments (Q). The final model was described by the following equations (for jth subject): CL(j) (liters/h) = 13.6.(CL(CR)(j)/98 ml/min)(0.659).(1 + CL(race)(j) [0 for Caucasian]) V(c)(j) (liters) = 11.6.(weight(j)/73 kg)(0.596)
