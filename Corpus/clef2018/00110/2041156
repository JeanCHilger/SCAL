Clinical evaluation of sultamicillin in lower respiratory tract infections. Clinical efficacy and safety of sultamicillin (SBTPC) in patients with lower respiratory tract infections, mainly pneumonia and bronchitis, have been evaluated in a multicenter trial by 19 institutions in the Kyushu area during a period of 12 months from December 1988 to November 1989. 1. Clinical evaluation was made in 132 patients and efficacy rates of SBTPC were 80.0% (28/35) for pneumonia, 78.5% (73/93) for bronchitis and 100% for the remaining 1 patient with other respiratory tract infections. The overall efficacy rate was 79.1% (102/129). 2. Clinical efficacy rate of SBTPC for respiratory tract infections in patients with underlying diseases such as chronic bronchitis, old pulmonary tuberculosis etc., was 75.0% (60/80) which was not significantly different from the efficacy rate of 85.7% (42/49) in patients without underlying diseases. 3. Of 13 patients who failed to respond to previous antibiotic treatments, 8 (61.5%) were effectively treated with SBTPC. 4. Clinical efficacy rates against infections caused by single species of organisms were 90.9% (10/11) for Haemophilus influenzae, 100% (8/8) for Streptococcus viridans and 100% (3/3) for Staphylococcus aureus. The overall clinical efficacy rate in all cases of monomicrobial infections was 88.6% (31/35), in polymicrobial infection 45.5% (5/11) and the overall efficacy rate in cases in which causative bacteria were identified was 78.3% (35/46). 5. Adverse reactions occurred in 6.8% (9/132) of the patients. The symptoms included allergic reaction in 1 patient, gastrointestinal system disorders in 7 patients and general fatigability in 1 patient. As abnormalities in laboratory test values, elevations of A1-P, GOT, and GPT were observed in 3 patients during the study, but returned to normal after discontinuation of SBTPC administration. 6. SBTPC is a useful antibiotic in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections under the current medical environment where resistant organisms which produce beta-lactamases have been increasing.
