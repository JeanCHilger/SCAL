Congenital pneumonia with sepsis caused by intrauterine infection of Ureaplasma parvum in a term newborn: a first case report. We present an autopsy case of intrauterine pneumonia in a term newborn in whom Ureaplasma parvum was confirmed by PCR examinations, including a novel diagnostic tool for detecting pathogens that caused neonatal infections using multiplex PCR. This is the first report of U. parvum being implicated in the pathogenesis of congenital pneumonia with sepsis in a term newborn.
