Are there any differences in the community acquired pneumonias admitted to hospital over the past decade? The past few years have seen a decline in community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children in the western world, although this has gone hand-in-hand with more serious cases needing hospital admission. Our study characterises cases of CAP admitted to hospital and compares this data with a 2001 study. We collected data on 63 admissions over a six-month period. The majority were aged 0-2 years old. Chest X-ray showed consolidation/atelectasy in 58 (92.1%) and pleural effusion (PE) in 17 (27.0%), of which 11 were empyema (17.4% of all admissions). The bacterial agent was isolated in five cases: Streptococcus pyogenes (two, pleural fluid), Streptococcus pneumoniae (two, blood culture) and Haemophilus influenzae (one, blood culture). Sixty-one children (96.8%) were prescribed antibiotherapy. The median length of hospital stay was five days. Patients with PE were older, had a longer course of fever, higher inflammatory parameters, longer hospital stay and longer course of iv antibiotics. Compared to the prior study we found greater severity of CAP, with higher prevalence of PE and empyema. Nevertheless there was a shorter course of fever during hospital stay and shorter hospital stay. We also noticed less antibiotic prescription prior to admission and greater prescription of ampicillin during hospital stay. In the literature, the higher severity of CAP has been partially attributed to the emergence of more aggressive serotypes of Stretococcus pneumoniae not included in the heptavalent vaccine. There is therefore a greater interest in new vaccines containing them. Complicated CAP should be referred to centres specialising in its diagnosis and management.
