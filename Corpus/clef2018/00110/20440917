Chronic respiratory diseases at primary health care level in Georgia: the results of the pilot study. Millions of people suffer from chronic respiratory diseases (CRD). To address this serious global health problem WHO formed the Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases (GARD). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major priority of GARD due to high chronic morbidity and mortality however, there is still little prevalence data available. The prevalence of COPD in Georgia, as well as other CRD, is suspected to be high.GARD Pilot Survey (GAPS) in Georgia had been carried out by the Georgian Respiratory Association. The survey was conducted in the Sagarejo and Mtskheta districts with total population of about 70.000. All subjects provided information on asthma, bronchitis, respiratory symptoms, smoking, allergic conditions, CRD comorbidity and lifestyle via an interviewer-administered questionnaire. A total of 3,646 questionnaires were analysed.It was discovered that official data concerning allergic rhinitis, TB and asthma are almost equal, but readings in relation to CRD are about five times lower according to official data of the Ministry of Health of Georgia. The data results: for allergic rhinitis - 218 in GAPS vs. 177 in the official statistics (for 100.000 population) for TB -105 in GAPS vs. 147 in the official statisticsIt is necessary to expand the survey to the entire country population. Country results are likely to be useful and interesting for local doctors and managers, as well as for officials.
