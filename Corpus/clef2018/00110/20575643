Phlebovirus meningoencephalis complicated by Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia: a case report. In June 2004 an 8-year-old boy was admitted to a hospital in Thessaloniki, Greece, because of high fever, tachypnea, hypotonia, diarrhea, and tonoclonic convulsions. Phlebovirus infection was diagnosed by IgG seroconversion to Toscana virus. As IgM antibodies were not detected, it is suggested that this was an acute infection caused by a phlebovirus virus distinct from Toscana virus. Complication by a hospital-acquired Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia resulted in 2 months of hospitalization. Slight ataxia was still present on discharge.
