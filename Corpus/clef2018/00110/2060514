Single agent therapy for infections in cancer patients: a prospective randomized trial comparing three extended-spectrum cephalosporins. Three hundred and twenty patients were enrolled in a prospective randomized trial comparing cefoperazone, ceftizoxime and ceftriaxone for initial therapy of infectious episodes in cancer patients. Patients with neutropenia were excluded. In 286 evaluable episodes, the response rates associated with the three agents were 77% for cefoperazone, 70% for ceftizoxime and 72% for ceftriaxone, with no statistically significant differences between the three treatment groups. The overall response rate for all episodes of pneumonia (64%) was significantly lower than the response rate for all other infections (81% p = 0.002), and the mortality associated with pneumonia (9%) was higher than that associated with all other episodes (2%
