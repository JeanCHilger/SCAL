Fuchs syndrome associated with Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Stevens-Johnson syndrome without skin lesions). Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a severe mucocutaneous disease following drugs or infections. We present a 7-year-old boy with mucous membrane lesions (stomatitis, conjunctivitis, and urethritis) but without skin lesions. The diagnosis of acute Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection strongly suggests a concomitant Fuchs syndrome.
