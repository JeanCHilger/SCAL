Surgical resection in Crohn's disease: is immunosuppressive medication associated with higher postoperative infection rates? The aim of this study was to analyse postoperative infection in patients undergoing surgery for Crohn's disease (CD) according to the use of preoperative immunosuppressants, including infliximab.With IRB approval, the records of all patients with CD who underwent abdominal surgery between 2001 and 2008 were reviewed for comorbidity, preoperative medication, type of surgery, stoma construction and postoperative complications. Patients were divided into three categories according to the preoperative medication within 90 days of surgery as follows: infliximab (IFX), other drugs including steroids and/or immunosuppressive agents (OD) and no drugs (ND).Two hundred and twenty-five patients were identified. Preoperative comorbidity, surgical indication and type of surgery were not significantly different among the three groups. Ileocolic resection was the most common procedure [50.8%, IFX group 61.2%, OD groupThere was no difference in the rate of postoperative complications among the groups of patients undergoing surgery for CD pretreated with IFX or other immunosuppressive drugs.
