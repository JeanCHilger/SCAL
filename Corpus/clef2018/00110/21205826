Pulmonary surfactant phosphatidylglycerol inhibits Mycoplasma pneumoniae-stimulated eicosanoid production from human and mouse macrophages. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a human pathogen causing respiratory infections that are also associated with serious exacerbations of chronic lung diseases. Membranes and lipoproteins from M. pneumoniae induced a 4-fold increase in arachidonic acid (AA) release from RAW264.7 and a 2-fold increase in AA release from primary human alveolar macrophages. The bacterial lipoprotein mimic and TLR2/1 agonist Pam3Cys and the TLR2/6 agonist MALP-2 produced effects similar to those elicited by M. pneumoniae in macrophages by inducing the phosphorylation of p38(MAPK) and p44/42(ERK1/2) MAP kinases and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. M. pneumoniae induced the generation of prostaglandins PGD(2) and PGE(2) from RAW264.7 cells and thromboxane B(2) (TXB(2)) from human alveolar macrophages. Anti-TLR2 antibody completely abolished M. pneumoniae-induced AA release and TNFα secretion from RAW264.7 cells and human alveolar macrophages. Disruption of the phosphorylation of p44/42(ERK1/2) or inactivation of cytosolic phospholipase A(2)α (cPLA(2)α) completely inhibited M. pneumoniae-induced AA release from macrophages. The minor pulmonary surfactant phospholipid, palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol (POPG), antagonized the proinflammatory actions of M. pneumoniae, Pam3Cys, and MALP-2 by reducing the production of AA metabolites from macrophages. The effect of POPG was specific, insofar as saturated PG, and saturated and unsaturated phosphatidylcholines did not have significant effect on M. pneumoniae-induced AA release. Collectively, these data demonstrate that M. pneumoniae stimulates the production of eicosanoids from macrophages through TLR2, and POPG suppresses this pathogen-induced response.
