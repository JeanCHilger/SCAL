The diagnostic accuracy of high-mobility group box 1 protein and twelve other markers in discriminating bacterial, viral and co-infected bronchial pneumonia in Han children. Pneumonia in children is common and can lead to grave consequences if not addressed in a proper and timely manner. In the management of pneumonia, early identification of the causative infective agent is of obvious importance for treatment, as it allows selection of the appropriate antibiotics. However, such identification requires laboratory test results, which may not be immediately available. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy and usefulness of 13 markers in differentiating between viral and bacterial pneumonia in Han children (34 healthy controls and 78 patients). It was found that WBC counts were more accurate in diagnosis of the type of agent responsible for infection than was the degree of expression of HMGB1. Among the 13 markers investigated, HMGB1 was the best at discriminating between co-infected (bacterium and virus) and single-infected (bacterium or virus) children with bronchial pneumonia. HMGB1 expression of less than 1.0256, excluded most co-infections (the negative predictive value was greater than 89.7%). Diagnosed sole viral pneumonia clinically overlapped with bacterial pneumonia, but bacterial pneumonia was more often associated with higher white blood cell (WBC) counts (WBC ≥ 13,000 cells/mm(3)). When the two marker readouts--HMGB1 < 1.0256 and WBC ≥ 13,000 cells/mm(3)--were combined, the positive predictive value for bacterial pneumonia alone was 92.3%. These findings can help clinicians discriminate between bronchial pneumonia caused by virus, bacterium or both with a high specificity.
