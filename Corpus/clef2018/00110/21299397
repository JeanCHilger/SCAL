Full-term neonatal intenstive care unit admission in an urban community hospital: the role of respiratory morbidity. To investigate the incidence of respiratory morbidity among full-term neonatal intenstive care unit (NICU) admissions and identify risk factors for such admissions.We performed a retrospective cohort study of NICU admissions between 1/06 and 12/08. We included neonates between 37 and 40 weeks with a diagnosis of transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN), respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), pneumonia, pneumothorax, and meconium aspiration syndrome. Obstetrical outcomes were compared with a control group of women during the same period whose neonates were not admitted to the NICU.Two-hundred two infants admitted to the NICU with respiratory morbidity were compared with 9580 controls. TTN comprised the majority of the respiratory morbidity. Only RDS was associated with cesarean delivery.RDS remains a significant morbidity in full-term NICU admission. When compared with controls, admissions to our NICU with any respiratory morbidity were more likely to be delivered by cesarean to a mother with hypertension or diabetes during pregnancy.
