Evaluation of fever in the immediate postoperative period in patients who underwent total joint arthroplasty. Forty percent to 50% of patients may experience an immediate postoperative fever. Research suggests that these are of aseptic cause due to inflammatory mediators. This is a retrospective analysis of fevers in total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients from 2006 to 2008. Thirty-six percent of THA and 31% of TKA patients developed a fever, with most developing a maximum temperature on postoperative day (POD) 2. The maximum mean temperature between the THA and TKA group was not significantly different. Fevers in the immediate postoperative period are a normal variant in patients undergoing THA or TKA. Urinalysis, urine culture and sensitivity, and chest x-ray are not required during this period because most of these fevers stem from aseptic causes.
