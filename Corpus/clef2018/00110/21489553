Pneumonia and malnutrition are highly predictive of mortality among African children hospitalized with human immunodeficiency virus infection or exposure in the era of antiretroviral therapy. To identify clinical characteristics predicting death among inpatients who are infected with or exposed to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) during a period of pediatric antiretroviral therapy scale-up in sub-Saharan Africa.Retrospective review of medical records from every child with HIV infection (n = 834) or exposure (n = 351) identified by routine inpatient testing in Kamuzu Central Hospital, Lilongwe, Malawi, September 2007 through December 2008.The inpatient mortality rate was high among children with HIV infection (16.6%) and exposure (13.4%). Clinically diagnosed Pneumocystis pneumonia or very severe pneumonia independently predicted death in inpatients with HIV infection (OR 14 95% CI 8.2 to 23) or exposure (OR 21Severe respiratory tract infections and malnutrition are both highly prevalent and strongly associated with death among hospitalized children who are HIV infected or exposed. Novel programmatic and therapeutic strategies are urgently needed to reduce the high mortality rate among inpatients with HIV infection and HIV exposure in African pediatric hospitals.
