Acute respiratory infections in ambulatory malnourished children: a serological study. We studied the aetiological agents of acute respiratory infections occurring in an ambulatory population of 83 malnourished Jamaican-born children aged 6 to 32 months using serological methods for diagnosis. In 60% (38/63) of symptomatic children and in 25% (5/20) of those without reported disease the following microorganisms were observed: parainfluenza viruses in 15 children, influenza viruses in 12, adenovirus in 10, respiratory syncitial virus in 7 and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in 7 children. The prevalence of the viral infections apparently increased with the severity of malnutrition.
