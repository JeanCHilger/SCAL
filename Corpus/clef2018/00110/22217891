Nonaccidental trauma presenting with respiratory distress and pleural effusion. Nonaccidental trauma (NAT) is common and presents with varied symptoms. Pleural effusion as a complication of physical abuse has not been described in the past. We report the case of a 10-week-old infant who presented with multiple nonspecific complaints that included respiratory distress, refusal to feed, constipation, and lethargy. Sepsis was the working diagnosis on admission, but a massive pleural effusion and rib fractures seen on chest imaging ultimately led to the diagnosis of nonaccidental trauma. This interesting case highlights the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for abuse irrespective of atypical presenting signs.
