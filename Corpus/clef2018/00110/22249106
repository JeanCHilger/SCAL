Pharmacokinetics and safety profile of tigecycline in children aged 8 to 11 years with selected serious infections: a multicenter, open-label, ascending-dose study. Tigecycline, a broad-spectrum antibiotic used for treating serious bacterial infections in adults, may be suitable for pediatric use once an appropriate dosage is determined.The aim of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties, safety profile, and descriptive efficacy of tigecycline.In this Phase II, multicenter, open-label clinical trial, children aged 8 to 11 years with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI), or complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) were administered tigecycline 0.75, 1, or 1.25 mg/kg.A total of 58 patients received ≥ 1 dose of tigecycline (31 boys 44 whiteA tigecycline dosage of ∼1.2 mg/kg q12h may represent the most appropriate dosage for subsequent evaluation in Phase III clinical trials in children aged 8 to 11 years with selected serious bacterial infections.
