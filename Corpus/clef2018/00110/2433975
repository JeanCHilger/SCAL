Local allergen challenge and bronchoalveolar lavage of allergic asthmatic lungs. Description of the model and local airway inflammation. The local mechanisms that result in the cellular inflammation and bronchial airway hyperreactivity that characterize allergic bronchial asthma are poorly defined. In order to study these processes, we developed a method for local allergen challenge using a fiberoptic bronchoscope and direct observation and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) to assess the airway responses to allergen. In these studies, 11 allergic asthmatics (all of whom had previously demonstrated a late-phase asthmatic response to aeroallergen challenge) and 6 healthy, asymptomatic subjects volunteered to undergo bronchoalveolar lavage after local airway challenge via a bronchoscope wedged into subsegmental airways. These studies revealed that asthmatic airways respond to allergen with an immediate pallor followed by reactive hyperemia, edema, and bronchial narrowing. This site and a control site were relavaged at 48 or 96 h after the immediate response. Neutrophils and eosinophils increased significantly at 48 h after challenge, as did helper T-lymphocytes. Characteristically, at 96 h, neutrophil counts returned to normal values, whereas eosinophiles and helper T-cells remained elevated. Peroxidase-staining cells were also elevated at 48 h after local allergen challenge. Electron microscopy revealed degranulation of mast cells and eosinophils, both immediately and later (48 and 96 h) after local allergen challenge. Macrophages were highly activated and had phagocytized, partially intact granules from both eosinophils and mast cells. There was a significant correlation (p less than 0.001) between the concentration of allergen required to produce a visible airway response and a positive end-point skin titration in the asthmatic subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
