The significance of social and familial factors. In the epidemiological group-diagnostic investigations of children taking place in the areas of Rhein/Main, Freiburg and Starnberg in 1982-1986, we registered supplementary characteristic of the familiar and social environments of the children by questionnaires in the years 1982/1983. From the results of the statistical evaluations we see that the health of the examined children responds equally to the social and familiar surroundings, such as housing space, indoor pollution, and social stimulants to the air quality or the meteorological and geographical characteristics of the different regions.
