Pharmacokinetic monitoring of antibiotic therapy. The general strategy in optimization of antibiotic dosage regimens included development of population or common regimens for an "average" patient (the 1st approximation), subpopulation regimens for patients of certain categories on the basis of interactions between the pharmacokinetic parameters and "patient factors" (the 2nd approximation) and individual regimens on the basis of the data of the pharmacokinetic monitoring (the 3rd approximation). Characteristics of every of the approximations in antibiotic therapy of adults and children were analyzed. Out of the peculiarities of the strategy use in pediatrics+ and micropediatrics+ the following should be indicated: (1) pharmacokinetic heterogeneity of the population requiring grouping of the patients and consequently development of subpopulation dosage regimens omitting stage I, (2) possible development of dosage regimens on the basis of the ration between the pharmacokinetic parameters or immediate drug concentration values and the "patient factors" not only in chronic but also in transitory impairment of some functions and (3) the necessity of considering systematic changes in "pharmacokinetic status" of every child during individualization of the dosage regimens by the data of the pharmacokinetic monitoring.
