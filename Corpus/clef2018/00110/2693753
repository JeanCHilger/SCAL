Clinical studies on cefixime in pediatrics. Clinical usefulness of cefixime (CFIX), a new oral cephalosporin antibiotic, in pediatric field was investigated. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. The clinical efficacy of CFIX was investigated in a total of 138 children including 49 with upper respiratory tract infections (RTI), 22 with acute bronchitis, 18 with pneumonia, 19 with scarlet fever and 21 with urinary tract infections (UTI). 2. Clinical effectiveness was excellent in 58, good in 60, fair in 14 and poor in 3, with an overall efficacy rate of 87.4%. The efficacy rate classified according to types of infection were 85.7% in upper RTI, 89.5% in acute bronchitis, 94.4% in pneumonia, 78.9% in scarlet fever, and 90.5% in UTI. 3. Out of the suspected causative organisms, 43 strains of a total of 50 strains isolated were eradicated. The bacteriological eradication rate was 86.0%. (Haemophilus influenzae 100%, Haemophilus parainfluenzae 100%, Streptococcus pyogenes 88.5%, Escherichia coli 85.7%). 4. One hundred forty four children were analyzed for side effect. Side effects were observed in 2 children (1.4%) with diarrhea in 1 and anorexia in another. Abnormal laboratory test results were recorded in 4 children (3.3%). The above results suggest that CFIX is a very useful new oral cephalosporin for the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
