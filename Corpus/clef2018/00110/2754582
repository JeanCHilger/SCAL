Postpneumonic empyema in childhood: selecting appropriate therapy. In order to identify appropriate treatment options for postpneumonic empyema, we reviewed the medical records and, when possible, obtained long-term follow-up chest radiographs and pulmonary function tests on children treated for empyema during the past 11 years. Fifty-one patients were treated in various ways, with antibiotics alone (N = 10), or in combination with tube thoracostomy (N = 23) or decortication (N = 18). Despite administration of appropriate antibiotics and establishment of pleural drainage, many children required prolonged hospitalization and eventual decortication. Based on this review, a scoring system was developed allowing early classification by severity of pleural disease. Factors found to be predictors of severe pleural disease include (1) low pleural fluid pH or (2) glucose (3) presence of moderate or severe scoliosis or (4) pleural peel or parenchymal entrapment by chest radiography
