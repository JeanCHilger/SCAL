A 168-kilodalton protein of Mycoplasma pneumoniae used as antigen in a dot enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The attachment protein of Mycoplasma pneumoniae (molecular weight 168 kd) was used as antigen in a special enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (dot ELISA) and compared with a sonicate of the whole organism. In control sera the intensity of the 168-kd band on immunoblots correlated well with the ELISA IgG values derived from isolated protein. The diagnostic significance of the 168-kd antigen was tested on paired sera from 33 patients with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection (24 children, 9 adults). The ELISA values with the isolated protein were slightly lower than with cell antigen, but the protein also showed a lower basic activity in controls. In first sera of specimens of children collected within the first week of infection the 168-kd IgM response was more distinct than that to the whole cell antigen. Similarly the IgG response to the purified protein antigen differed significantly from the controls already in the first serum. In sera of adult patients the increased levels of IgG antibody were more evident with the 168-kd protein antigen. Use of the protein 168 kd as antigen increased the sensitivity of the ELISA for detecting early stages of disease, especially in children.
