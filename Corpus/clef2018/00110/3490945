Systemic Hemophilus influenzae disease in children. A 10-year retrospective study of an urban hospital population. A 10-year retrospective study of age-frequency, sites of infection, and pre-existing conditions in 297 children with Hemophilus influenzae (HI) disease seen at Grady Memorial Hospital from 1974 through 1984 is described. The majority of the patients were black (73%) and of lower socioeconomic status and were less than 2 years of age. Manifestations of HI disease were similar to those described in reports from other centers, with meningitis being the most common (56.7%). Epiglottitis was much less common in the present study than is generally reported. The death rate of all patients was 1.8 percent. The results of this study indicate that HI disease continues to be a significant risk in children less than 2 years of age.
