Diagnostic audit of C-reactive protein in neonatal infection. A prospective study of 250 consecutive neonatal admissions to a regional perinatal referral centre and of 10 additional consecutive cases with culture-proven neonatal septicaemia was undertaken. Quantitative C-reactive protein (CRP) determination, white cell count and differential were performed on blood samples obtained from all babies on admission, as well as 10-14 h and 22-26 h later. Using clinical signs, chest X-rays, blood cultures, tracheal aspirates obtained within 4 h of delivery and an abnormal immature/total neutrophil ratio (I/T), infected babies were defined as belonging to one of the following groups: culture-proven septicaemia (n = 19) clinical septicaemia (n = 35)
