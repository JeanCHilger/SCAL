Measles epidemic in young adults. Clinical manifestations and laboratory analysis in 40 patients. Between February and June 1985, 40 military personnel were hospitalized because of measles. Diagnosis in all patients was entirely clinical, and serologic investigations were noncontributory. A transient disturbance in liver function occurred in 70% of patients, and its extent correlated with duration of fever and disease complications. Spontaneously resolving, measles-specific hypocalcemia, which was not associated with hepatic dysfunction, was noted in about one third of the patients. All these patients were asymptomatic, except one patient who developed tetany. The pathophysiologic basis for the hypocalcemia is still unknown. The disease course in three previously immunized patients was benign and uncomplicated.
