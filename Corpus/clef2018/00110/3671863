Bacteriological aspects of 64 cases of severe pneumonia seen in a respiratory intensive care unit. We report on the bacterial aspects of 64 cases of severe pneumonia in an intensive care over a two year period, excluding cases occurring during artificial ventilation. In all the cases, the grave respiratory and haemodynamic signs, the blood gas and radiological findings justified admission of these patients to an intensive care unit. Specimens for bacteriology, virology and parasitology enabled a precise microbiological diagnosis 43 times (63%) in 44% of these diagnosis the possibility of the protected specimens (trans-tracheal, protected brushing) were confirmed by another specimen (pleural or blood). The germs identified were: Streptococcus pneumoniae (13), Staphylococcus aureus (9), Haemophilus influenzae (6), other gram negatives (12), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (1), Koch's bacillus (1), Aspergillus fumigatus, Cytomegalovirus, Myxovirus, Pneumocystis carinii (5). Twenty eight patients died of whom eight had marrow failure following chemotherapy
