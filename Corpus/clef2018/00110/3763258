Magnetic resonance imaging of inflammatory lung disorders: preliminary studies in children. Magnetic resonance(MR) scans were performed on 14 children with a variety of inflammatory disorders of the lungs. MR successfully identified disease in all of the children and accurately localized the disease within the lung fields. In patients with pneumonia and lung abscesses the acute inflammation was associated with a marked increase in signal intensity on T2 when compared with T1 weighted images. One patient with an inflammatory pseudotumor demonstrated a smaller increase in signal intensity on T2 weighted images than was seen in acute pneumonia. Abscess cavities were well identified along with the wall thickness. In patients with diffuse lung disease (diffuse histoplasmosis, miliary tuberculosis, Letterer-Siwe disease, and allergic alveolitis), each disease appeared different on the MR images. These preliminary studies indicate that magnetic resonance imaging is effective for identifying pulmonary disease in children and may improve the radiologist's ability to differentiate pulmonary disorders.
