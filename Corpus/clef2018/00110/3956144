Pneumonia in infants and children. The diagnosis of pneumonia in infants and children is commonly made despite the lack of a definitive test or screening procedure to aid the clinician. Treatment decisions are usually based upon the knowledge of the most likely causative pathogens important in the individual patient's age group. Morbidity due to pneumonia is, in most cases, mild, so that most children can be managed at home.
