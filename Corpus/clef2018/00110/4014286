Emerging perspectives in management and prevention of infections of the respiratory tract in infants and children. New products, new procedures, new information, and new legislation will have a significant impact on management and prevention of respiratory infections in children. Current areas of investigation include the changing epidemiology (increased number of children in day care), concern about morbidity of common infections (hearing impairment and effect on development of speech and language due to otitis media), and new modes of microbiologic diagnosis (antigen detection). New antimicrobial agents have wider spectrums of activity, increased concentrations in body fluids, and lesser toxicity than available drugs. New uses of old drugs are identified (value of erythromycin for Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae). Increased usage of chemoprophylaxis for prevention of recurrences of acute otitis media follows publication of impressive results of recent studies. New conjugate polysaccharide vaccines are immunogenic in young infants. Finally, and of major importance to children, physicians, and manufacturers, is vaccine liability legislation, now in congressional committee.
