Effects of experimentally induced Pasteurella haemolytica pneumonia on the pharmacokinetics of erythromycin in the calf. Pneumonic pasteurellosis was produced experimentally in 3- to 4-month-old Holstein bull calves by bilateral intrapulmonary administration of 5 X 10(7) to 10(9) colony-forming units of Pasteurella haemolytica. Of 8 calves, 4 developed minor pulmonary changes, 1 died of an apparent bacteremia within 24 hours, and 3 developed extensive pneumonic changes. At 1 week before (1 dose) and at 48, 60, and 72 hours (3 doses) after Pasteurella administration, the calves were given erythromycin at a dosage of 15 mg/kg, and the pharmacokinetic values were determined. There were statistically (P less than or equal to 0.05) significant increases in the distribution and elimination rates associated with pneumonia. The elimination half life decreased from 132.7 +/- 9.6 minutes in prepneumonic calves to 111.1 +/- 13.8 minutes and 99.7 +/- 2.6 minutes in calves with minor and with moderate pneumonic changes, respectively. There also was a decrease in apparent volume of distribution with pneumonia. Erythromycin tissue concentrations were determined 2 hours after the last dose was given to the calves with pneumonia. Tissue concentrations in the pneumonic lung areas were as high or higher than those in nonaffected lung tissues in the same animals. Because of the increased rate of elimination from serum in pneumonic calves, it may be advisable to use shorter dosage intervals in calves with severe respiratory tract disease.
