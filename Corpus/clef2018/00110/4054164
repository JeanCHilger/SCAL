Pneumonia in young children with homozygous sickle cell disease: risk and clinical features. The incidence and clinical features of pneumonia have been examined in children with homozygous sickle cell (SS) disease and in age/sex matched control children with a normal haemoglobin (AA) genotype followed in a cohort study of sickle cell disease from birth. Survival curve analysis indicated a similar incidence of pneumonia in the two genotypes up to the ages of 8 months after which pneumonia became significantly more prevalent in SS disease, the relative risk exceeding a factor of four by 4 years of age. Children with SS disease were also more prone to multiple episodes. Comparison of clinical features in the two genotypes yielded no difference in sex or seasonal involvement, or in the results of bacteriological and radiological investigations. Children with SS disease and pneumonia had an increased frequency and increased duration of hospital admission, and mortality was confined to this group. It is concluded that children with SS disease have an increased prevalence of single and multiple attacks of pneumonia and that these events run a more serious clinical course than in control children.
