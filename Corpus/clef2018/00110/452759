Intrauterine infections in pregnancy. The significance of premature rupture of the membranes and early lung complications. The course of intrauterine infections are illustrated and 5 maternal deaths reported. Early lung complications were predominant, described as shock lung or septic pneumonia. Renal complications or disseminated intravascular coagulation were absent or developed late. In contrast to gram negative sepsis there was a frequent association with premature rupture of the membranes, which indicates the danger of this event. On microbiology gram positive rods were found more frequently than a mixed flora. The morphology of intrauterine infection is similar to those of puerperal sepsis although the clinical course is quite different. This indicates a change in infectious pattern during the last centuries.
