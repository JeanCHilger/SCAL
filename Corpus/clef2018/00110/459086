Therapeutic effect of midecamycin on Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia in adults (author's transl). The clinical efficacy of a macrolide antibiotic, midecamycin, was studied in 12 adult cases with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia. The therapeutic effects were excellent or good in 9 cases and fair in 2 cases. On defervescence and disappearance of shadows on chest X-ray the therapeutic effect was satisfactory, but on disappearance of cough therapeutic effect was not clear in some cases. Taking into consideration the antimicrobial activity of midecamycin against Mycoplasma pneumoniae, serum concentration and side effects of midecamycin, this antibiotic is expected to be effective in the treatment of Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia.
