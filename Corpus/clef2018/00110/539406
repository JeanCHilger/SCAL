Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. A retrospective review of 103 hospitalised children. The clinical aspects of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in 103 children under 12 years admitted to hospital over an eight-year period were reviewed retrospectively. Respiratory illnesses occurred in 87 (85%) cases. The prevalence of lower respiratory tract involvement was similar in both pre-school and school children. Cough was the commonest symptom at all ages. Coryzal symptoms and wheeze were common in pre-school children. Most infants had signs of pharyngitis or otitis media. Non-specific symptoms--fever, lethargy, malaise, anorexia and vomiting--were common accompaniments in children older than one year of age. Non-respiratory illnesses in 16 (15%) patients included gastroenteritis, convulsions, non-specific skin rashes and limb pains. The duration of stay in hospital ranged from two to 30 days (median five days) with apparent clinical recovery and resolution of chest X-ray abnormalities within three months in 78 (76%) patients seen for review.
