Differential cytopathogenicity accompanying Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection of human lung fibroblasts maintained in newborn bovine serum or fetal bovine serum. MRC-5 human lung fibroblasts maintained in Eagle's basal medium (BME) with either 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) or 10% newborn bovine serum (NBS) did not respond identically to infection by Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Fibroblasts grown in NBS did not develop any cytopathic effect (CPE) when infected with M. pneumoniae, whereas those maintained in FBS developed a pronounced CPE. There was also a difference in sensitivity to infection for fibroblasts maintained in the two sera before the infection. Fibroblasts maintained in NBS, then transferred to FBS 48 h before infection, were still less sensitive to M. pneumoniae infection than cells maintained constantly in FBS. Mycoplasma pneumoniae attached comparably to the fibroblasts grown in the two sera, so the differences in CPE development could not be attributed to differences in mycoplasma attachment. Measurements of DNA, RNA, and protein syntheses of the fibroblasts grown in NBS and FBS indicate that the cells in NBS were growing more rapidly than those in FBS. A determination of the doubling times shows that the doubling time of cells in NBS was 44 h, whereas that of cells in FBS was 51 h. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of samples of NBS and FBS showed significant differences in serum protein composition. The NBS had several protein bands that were lacking in the FBS. This study demonstrates the importance of serum effects in the study of M. pneumoniae infection.
