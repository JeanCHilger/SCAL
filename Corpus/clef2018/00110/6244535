Characteristics of adenohypophseal secretory activity in children with thymomegaly. The radioimmunological method was applied in the study of ACTH, STH, and prolactin content in thymomegaly combined with pneumonia, and in practically healthy children. A comparative analysis of hormonal parameters depending on the functional condition of the thymus demonstrated a directly proportional correlation between the STH, prolactin level, and the thymus hyperplasia there proved to be a reverse relationship between the ACTH level and thymomegaly. Hypoadrenocorticotropinemia, hypersomatotropinemia, and hyperprolactinemia could be used as diagnostic criteria in thymomegaly.
