Stevens-Johnson syndrome associated with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections. The Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a multisystem inflammatory disorder associated with a widespread erythematous eruption that can result in death. Although usually considered a pediatric disease, this syndrome frequently affects adults. There are many etiologic associations including drugs and infections however, the pathophysiology of the syndrome remains obscure. Treatment at present is symptomatic and supportive. Although frequently used, the beneficial role of corticosteroids in this syndrome remains to be proved. The case report describes a young woman who after treatment with several drugs developed the Stevens-Johnson syndrome in association with a Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. We include a brief review of the literature with emphasis on the Stevens-Johnsons syndrome's association with M pneumoniae infections. Those caring for patients with skin disease should be aware of the association between such treatable infections and this syndrome.
