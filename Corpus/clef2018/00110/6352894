Diagnosis and treatment of right Bochdalek hernia associated with group B streptococcal pneumonia and sepsis in the neonate. Neonatal sepsis due to group B beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (GBS) is reported to occur in about 1 out of 330 live births. Right-sided Bochdalek hernia (RBH) occurs in about 1 of 20,000 live births. The combination of group B streptococcal sepsis and delayed appearance of a right Bochdalek hernia is an infrequently reported phenomenon--18 patients have been previously reported in the English literature. We add four patients from our own experience to these previous reports. Since approximately 10% to 15% of the newborn population are exposed to group B Streptococcus we suspect that the inadequate diaphragmatic motion on the side of the Bochdalek hernia predisposes the child to development of septicemia and/or pneumonitis. Once the etiology has been established and appropriate antibiotic therapy instituted, progressive improvement in the patient's course should be seen. This is in contrast to a very significant mortality rate in many of the patients having early onset GBS. Any child, therefore, surviving early onset GBS only to deteriorate again, should be suspected of having an associated right Bochdalek hernia, and diagnostic steps should be taken to evaluate the integrity of the right diaphragm.
