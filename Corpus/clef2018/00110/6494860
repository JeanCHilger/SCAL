Brainstem encephalitis and vesicular exanthema caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Serologically proven Mycoplasma pneumonitis followed by vesicular mucocutaneous eruptions and aseptic brainstem encephalitis was observed in a 4-year-old boy. Both neurological and dermatological symptoms occurred approximately 2 weeks after the onset of pneumonia. The patient was treated with tetracyclines, corticosteroids and general supportive care and recovered completely over several months. An etiological relationship between mycoplasmal infection and neurological and dermatological symptoms, as already described in the literature, is postulated. A viral etiology was excluded by appropriate serological and cultural investigations.
