Radiographic findings in neonatal pneumonia. The chest films of 30 infants with autopsy-proved pulmonary infections were reviewed to assess the radiographic changes in neonatal pneumonia. The most common abnormality identified was bilateral alveolar densities, noted in 77% of cases. One-third of patients had characteristically extensive, dense alveolar changes with numerous air bronchograms. A pattern of radiographic abnormalities consistent with transient tachypnea of the newborn was found in 17% of cases, and a second pattern resembling hyaline membrane disease was found in 13%. Recognition of the spectrum of expected radiographic changes can aid in the diagnosis of neonatal pneumonia, particularly if this information is correlated with the clinical features.
