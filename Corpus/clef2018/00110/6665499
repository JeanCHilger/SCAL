Pneumopathies caused by Chlamydia trachomatis in pediatrics. Chlamydia trachomatis now has an important place in infantile respiratory pathology. In neonates, it is transmitted in utero, which explains one quarter of the cases of interstitial pneumonia seen during the first months of life. In children, the number of carriers of antibodies increases with age and may be more than 40 p. cent by the age of 7 years. The mode of contamination and the pathological significance remain uncertain in this age group. Chlamydia trachomatis can be a cause of pneumonia in immuno-depressed patients. A survey conducted in a Paediatric Respiratory Medicine Unit showed that 22 p. cent of patients were carriers of the antibody and at least 7.8 p. cent were infected.
