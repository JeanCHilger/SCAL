Chlamydia trachomatis pneumonia in adults: radiographic appearance. Radiographic findings in six adults with evidence of community-acquired Chlamydia trachomatis pneumonia were studied. Streaky infiltration, without evidence of consolidation, and multilobar involvement were characteristic. Radiographic features that distinguish this unique entity from other community-acquired pneumonias and from Chlamydia trachomatis pneumonia in infancy are also discussed.
