Cefuroxime therapy for pneumonia in infants and children. Because Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae b and Staphylococcus aureus are the major causes of bacterial pneumonia in infancy, we customarily have given a beta-lactam antibiotic and chloramphenicol as initial antibiotic therapy. Cefuroxime (75 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours iv or im) was evaluated as single drug therapy in an open study of 100 infants and children with suspected bacterial pneumonia. The mean serum concentration of cefuroxime 30 minutes after a 15-minute infusion of 25 mg/kg iv was 29.1 micrograms/ml, and the volume of distribution was 695 ml/kg. Pleural fluid concentrations in 3 specimens were 2.2, 8.5 and 11 micrograms/ml. Median age of patients was 15 months. Bacterial etiology was established in 20 patients: H. influenzae b (8 patients) pneumococcus (8 patients)
