Experience with live donor nephrectomy. We studied 100 patients undergoing nephrectomy for living related renal transplantation. after completion of tissue typing preoperative studies included urinalysis and culture, creatinine clearance determination, excretory urography and renal arteriography. Patient characteristics, preoperative test, surgical approach, complications, long-term followup and cost factors were reviewed. There was no mortality and morbidity was minimal except for wound complications. Renal function generally remained normal. Donor nephrectomy is a worthwhile and safe procedure with an acceptably low incidence of postoperative complications.
