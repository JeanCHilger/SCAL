Acute respiratory distress syndrome of tuberculous origin in an intensive care unit. Clinical presentation and course (author's transl). The authors have observed 6 cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) of tuberculous origin. The condition presented as pulmonary oedema in 4 cases and as extensive bilateral pneumonia in 2. Pulmonary oedema was treated by artificial ventilation with intermittent positive pressure in 2 patients who died, and by continuous positive airway pressure in 2 patients who survived. The 2 patients with pneumonia survived without respiratory assistance. In these patients with atypical symptoms, early diagnosis (which may involve liver and bone marrow biopsies) and immediate therapeutic measures are life-saving. The diagnosis of tuberculosis should be systematically considered in adult ARDS, especially i patients with pulmonary oedema of unknown origin.
