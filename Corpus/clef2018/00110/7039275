Candida albicans pneumonia: radiographic appearance. A retrospective series of patients with pure Candida albicans pulmonary opportunistic infection confirmed at autopsy were examined for any characteristic radiographic pattern. Of the 20 patients examined, eight showed nonlobar, nonsegmental, bilateral disease the others exhibited unilateral or bilateral lobar or segmental patterns. Cavitation, adenopathy, masslike opacities, or a miliary pattern were not identified. Radiographically these "negative" findings can be useful in distinguishing Candida from other fungal opportunistic infections. Histologic evidence of lung invasion by Candida is necessary for definitive confirmation. The previously described association of Candida infection with certain underlying diseases (leukemia and lymphoma) was again demonstrated.
