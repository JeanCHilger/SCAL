Recurrent pneumonia in children and its relationship to bronchial hyperreactivity. To determine what conditions are most likely to cause persistent or recurrent pneumonia (PRP) in children, the records of 81 children referred to James Whitcomb Riley Hospital for Children for evaluation of PRP were reviewed. Twenty patients had an apparent underlying cause that predisposed them to PRP. Of the 61 remaining patients (mean age 3.8 years) without any apparent cause for PRP, 49% had a history of allergy or family history of asthma, 31% patients had a history of wheezing and 18% were wheezing during their initial visit. No patient had an elevated sweat chloride determination or immunoglobulin deficiency. Of the 12 patients who were able to be recalled for pulmonary function testing, three had airflow obstruction that responded to an inhaled bronchodilator (isoproterenol). Of the nine patients with normal function, eight responded to methacholine with a decrease from base line in the one-second forced expiratory volume of greater than 20%. In all, 92% of those tested had bronchial hyperreactivity. These results indicate that asthma is a common cause of PRP in children and that PRP may occur as the initial symptom even in the absence of wheezing.
