Cystic fibrosis in adult patients. Seven adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are described. In five the diagnosis was established at adult age, the oldest being 37 years. All of them had chronic respiratory infections, but the general condition was relatively good in five of the cases. Milder cases of CF are probably underdiagnosed in young adults. Certain features seem rather characteristic for the disease and should alert the physician. The diagnosis may be suspected when a routine chest roentgenogram shows the presence of predominantly upper lobe infiltrations, atelectasis and bronchiectasis. Chronic and recurrent lung infections, especially when they are staphylococcal, can also be a guide. The sweat test is most valuable for the diagnosis, but decreased pancreatic function can support it in doubtful cases.
