Effectiveness of acetylspiramycin for Mycoplasma pneumonia in children (author's transl). The clinical efficacy and safety of acetylspiramycin for Mycoplasma pneumonia in children were studied at a dose level of 50 mg/kg/day q.i.d. and the following results were obtained. Acetylspiramycin showed effect in 24 patients out of 25 (96.0%). The level of transminase was increased in 3 cases on admission. One of them was an uneffective case, and eruption was seen after administrating the drug. Diarrhea and poor appetite were observed in one case as side effects, and they were controlled easily. It may be concluded from these results acetylspiramycin was relatively free from side effects and considered to be useful for Mycoplasma pneumonia.
