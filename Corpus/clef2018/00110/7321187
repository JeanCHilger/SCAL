Clinical effect of acetylspiramycin on primary atypical pneumonia in children (author's transl). Clinical effect of acetylspiramycin, one of macrolide antibiotics, primary atypical pneumonia and serologically proven Mycoplasma pneumonia in children was studied. Twenty-four cases of these pneumonia (PAP 11, MP 13) in children were selected and acetylspiramycin was given in dose of approximately 30 mg/kg/day orally. Clinical response was evaluated in terms of improvement in fever, cough and chest X-ray. Clinical response was excellent in 4, good in 5, fair in 14 cases and none in 1 case. No definite adverse effect was observed, however 3 cases showed skin rashes. Two cases showed evanescent small erythematopapulous rash and 1 case developed urticaria on the 2nd to 4th day after this drug was given. These skin rash seemed one of the manifestation of Mycoplasma infections, rather than adverse side effect. One case showed elevated transaminase activity before acetylspiramycin was given and improved on the 2nd week, although this drug was continued. No other side effect was observed. We were able to use acetylspiramycin only in the form of 200 mg tablet and difficulty of the administration was encountered in children under 5 years of age. Other form (dry syrup, etc.) of this drug should be considered for the clinical use in children. In conclusion, acetylspiramycin was effective and safe for the treatment of primary atypical pneumonia and Mycoplasma pneumonia.
