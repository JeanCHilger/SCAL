Poisoning by adulterated edible oil. In spring 1981, thousands of people living in Madrid were intoxicated by adulterated edible oil containing oleoanilide and probably other toxic substances. Due to increasing international travel Swiss doctors may also be faced with this particular disease. The case is reported of a 28-year-old woman who presented in May 1981 with a highly febrile influenza-like syndrome after consuming the adulterated oil while in Madrid. In the following weeks she developed myopathy, characterized by muscular weakness and pain, aldolase elevation and typical electromyographic disturbances, as well as edema and general discomfort. The white cell count showed eosinophilia up to 2170/mm3. Five months later, the symptoms are still continuing. Other members of the family have been exposed to the oleoanilide and exhibited various abnormalities which constitute a new clinical syndrome different from previously reported intoxications by industrial oil.
