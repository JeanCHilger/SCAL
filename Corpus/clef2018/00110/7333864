Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection presenting as acute rheumatic fever. We describe five children in whom symptoms and signs fully consistent with a diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever arose in association with infection by Mycoplasma pneumoniae. With the decline of streptococcal disease as a causative agent of acute rheumatic fever, other etiologic possibilities capable of reproducing the clinical syndrome - especially Mycoplasma pneumoniae - should be considered, as this may have therapeutic and prognostic implications.
