Seric ceruloplasmin in melanodermic and albino inhabitants of Cameroon (author's transl). The mean value of seric ceruloplasmin in 120 albino inhabitants of Cameroon is 36 +/- 10 mg/ 100 ml. It differs (P < 0,001) much significantly from the value observed (50 +/- 11 mg/100 ml) in a group of 71 registered melanodermic individuals. If compared to the melanodermic reference group, there is a significant increase of the seric ceruloplasmin value, in patients affected by inflammatory lung diseases, and a very significant difference with a group of pregnant women at delivery time.
