Chlamydia trachomatis and pneumonia in infants: report of two cases. In two cases of pneumonia associated with Chlamydia trachomatis in infants the symptoms began in the second week of life and the illness was severest at 4 weeks of age. Both infants were afebrile. One had a history of conjunctivitis. Both presented with a characteristic staccato cough and tachypnea but little evidence of peripheral airway obstruction. Chest roentgenograms showed interstitial and alveolar pulmonary infiltration in hyperexpanded lungs. The serum IgM concentrations were markedly elevated. C. trachomatis was cultured from specimens from both infants and one mother, and titres of antibody to the organism were substantially elevated in one infant and one mother.
