Treatment of pneumonia under hospital conditions. A random sample of 24 patients affected by bacterial pneumonia has been investigated whether their illness is treated etiologically. The agents have been detected from the endoscopically obtained samples of blood or chest punctate (percutaneous needle aspirate--PNA) and their sensitivity to antibacterial drugs, used in our institution, have been investigated. The obtained results have been compared to the empirically applied drugs. In only three patients the first given drug corresponded to the later obtained finding of the agent's sensitivity and in one patient third and the fourth drug has been adequate. The rational initial therapy has been proposed on the basis of investigation of the sensitivity of the bacterial pneumonia agents.
