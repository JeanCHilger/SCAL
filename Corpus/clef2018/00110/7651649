Latency period after preterm premature rupture of membranes: a comparison of ampicillin with and without sulbactam. To compare ampicillin with and without sulbactam with respect to the effect on the latency period after preterm premature rupture of membranes (PROM).Patients with PROM at 25-35 weeks' gestation were offered participation in a randomized blinded trial comparing ampicillin-sulbactam with ampicillin. Evaluations for cervical pathogens were performed on admission and patients were followed-up with daily maternal and fetal evaluation. Maternal and neonatal outcomes were analyzed using indicated techniques.Fifty-three women were studied, with 25 receiving ampicillin-sulbactam and 28 receiving ampicillin. The ampicillin-sulbactam group had a significantly longer latency period (433 +/- 625 versus 143 +/- 165 hours, P = .03) and significantly fewer neonatal complications (five versus 20, P < .001). Although no neonatal infectious complications were observed in sulbactam-treated cases, there were four cases of neonatal sepsis and two of neonatal pneumonia in the ampicillin group. Also, significantly more neonates in the ampicillin group required prolonged oxygen and ventilatory support. There was no significant difference in maternal morbidity.In our population with preterm PROM, a broad-spectrum antibiotic that provides anaerobic coverage appears to extend latency and decrease neonatal morbidity without increasing adverse maternal outcome.
