The correction of the imbalance in the proteinase-inhibitor system of patients with protracted pneumonia with the enterosorbent polifepan. The evidence obtained by the authors indicates that enterosorbent polyphepan corrects unbalance in the proteinase-inhibitory system of bronchial lavage from patients with lingering pneumonia and endobronchitis. Clinical symptoms improved also. A long-term (18 days) intermittent course (0.3 g/kg 4 days with 3-day intervals) is tolerated satisfactorily, produces no side effects (no colon dysfunction), retains normal hemoglobin values, total protein, enhances antiproteinase activity. As a result of the treatment hospital stay for the above patients reduced noticeably.
