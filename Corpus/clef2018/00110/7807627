Trial of co-trimoxazole versus procaine penicillin G and benzathin penicillin + procaine penicillin G in the treatment of childhood pneumonia. This study, which aimed to assess the results of three different regimens in the treatment of pneumonia, was carried out at the Pediatric Outpatient Department of Capa Children's Hospital in Istanbul on 151 patients aged between 4 months and 14 years. The first group (n = 46) received co-trimoxazole orally for 10 days and the second group (n = 63) procaine penicillin G in intramuscularly for 10 days. Benzathin penicillin G combined with procaine penicillin G was given to the third group (n = 42) as a single dose intramuscularly. While the best results were obtained with penicillin procaine G, no statistically significant difference was found between this regimen and co-trimoxazole therapy (chi 2 = 0.305023 P = 0.5). We suggest that co-trimoxazole is easy to administer and cost effective in the ambulatory treatment of pneumonia in children.
