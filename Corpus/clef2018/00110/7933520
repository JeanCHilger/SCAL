Clinical evaluation of biapenem (L-627) in children. Twenty-four children were treated with biapenem (L-627) and the clinical efficacy and side effects were evaluated. The ages of the patients ranged from two months to 11.5 years and their body weights from 5.9 to 43.5 kg. Doses given were 5.5-12.4 mg/kg every 8 hours for 2.67 to 11.33 days. Those patients who responded well to L-627 treatment included 11 children with pneumonia, 1 with scarlet fever, 1 with cervical lymphadenitis, 2 with cellulitis, 6 with urinary tract infection. Among 21 children, the results were excellent in 13 and good in 8. The drug was well tolerated, although slightly elevated serum concentrations of transaminases occurred in 2 patients among the 24 patients.
