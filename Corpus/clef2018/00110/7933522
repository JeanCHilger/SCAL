Clinical studies on biapenem (L-627) in the pediatric field. Biapenem (L-627) was given intravenously to 17 children with acute bacterial infections including 3 with purulent tonsillitis, 1 with bronchitis, 4 with pneumonia, 2 with sepsis, 3 with pyelonephritis, 2 with SSSS. (2 cases are omitted from evaluation because of Mycoplasma pneumonia and infectious mononucleosis). Daily dosages per kg bodyweight ranging from 18.3 to 60 mg were given in 3 divided doses per day for 4 to 6 days. Clinical responses were excellent in 12 (80%), good in 2 (13.3%), fair in 1 (6.7%) and poor in 0 (0%), with an overall efficacy rate of 93.3%. Good bacteriological responses were obtained in all of the 9 cases from which pathogens were identified. A side effect is observed in only 1 case with mild diarrhea. The above results suggest that L-627 is a useful new carbapenem derivative for the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
