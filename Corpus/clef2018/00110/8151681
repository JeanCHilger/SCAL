The role of IgA determination by ELISA in the early serodiagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection, in relation to IgG and mu-capture IgM methods. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for IgA, IgG and IgM was evaluated with sera from 50 adult patients with pneumonia, selected on the basis of a positive complement fixation (CF) test for diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection and with sera from 105 healthy blood donors. The ELISA antigen for IgG and IgA was a sonicated suspension of M. pneumoniae solubilised by deoxycholate. For the IgM assay, the same antigen was directly conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and used in a mu-capture format. ELISA gave positive results with high or rising titres for one or several antibody classes in 47 (94%) patients. In two of the three ELISA-negative cases, the diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection indicated by the CF test seemed unlikely on clinical grounds. Specific IgA antibodies was developed more regularly and more rapidly than IgM. IgA titres also started to decrease earlier than IgM or the late-peaking IgG response. Thus, the determination of IgA antibodies was found to be valuable for the early diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection. The study also demonstrated that the determination of all three antibody classes is necessary to obtain an optimal level of serodiagnosis.
