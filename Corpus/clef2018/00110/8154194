Criteria audit: making use of existing data. The first steps in setting up a criteria audit are presented with the aim of serving as a guide for starting quality assurance activities in Papua New Guinea. These activities need to be based on data, and the systematic and critical analysis of any available data on the process or outcome of health care delivery is a simple, cheap and useful basis for its improvement. Criteria are defined and the completeness and relevance of the data audited are discussed. Recommendations on the use of available recorded data and on the improvement of record-keeping practices are made.
