Five-day treatment of non-severe, community-acquired pneumonia with josamycin. This study assessed the efficacy of oral josamycin 1 g bd for five days as treatment for non-severe, community-acquired pneumonia in patients less than 60 years of age who were not at obvious risk of developing respiratory tract infection caused by aerobic Gram-negative bacilli. Of the 84 patients (43 male, 41 female) with a mean age of 33 years who were enrolled during a 14-month period, the clinical outcome was invariably favourable. All patients became afebrile within three days of starting therapy the mean duration of fever after initiating treatment was 1.7 days. Therefore, according to the study protocol, josamycin therapy was discontinued on day five. A chest X-ray performed four to six weeks after completing treatment was normal in every case and no relapses were observed during a six-week follow-up period. We conclude that a five-day course of josamycin is effective monotherapy for community-acquired pneumonia in patients without the clinical features of severe infection.
