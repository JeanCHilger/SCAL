Mycoplasma pneumonias in childhood (author's transl). During the winter months 1974/75 we were able to observe a number of unusual respiratory tract infections particularly in children over 6 years of age which appeared as pneumonias. Characteristic clinical findings included a dry, hacky cough, refractive to the usual antitussives, starting 1--2 weeks prior to admission, fever up to 104, malaise, headache, anorexia, shortness of breath and cyanosis. Several Pts were treated prior to admission with a number of antibiotics and failed to respond. Laboratory findings showed a peripheral polymorphonuclear leucocytosis with toxic granulations of neutrophiles. A sedimentation rate above 40 in the first hour occurred in most Pts. X Ray of the lung revealed a characteristic mottled appearance with patchy infiltrations, atelectasis and nodular densities. Frequently a shift of the mediastinum towards the infiltrate was seen. One of the hallmarks on physical examination was the discrepancy between the severity of the clinical illness and the paucity of physical findings. Decreased breath sounds over affected lung areas were often the only findings on auscultation find rales, rhonchi or dullness on percussion were less often heard. The combination of a typical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and X Ray findings enabled us to make a presumptive clinical diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumonia before serologic test results were available and to start with the appropriate antibiotic (Erythromycin, Tetracycline) early in the course of the disease. Complement fixation tests with a titer of 1 : 20 and a fourfold rise over the next two weeks or an initial titer of 1 : 80 and above were considered significant for acute disease.
