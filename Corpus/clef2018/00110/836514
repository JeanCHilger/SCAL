A migrant study of adopted Apache children. Reservation-born Apache children adopted into non-Apache homes off the reservation at an early age were studied for incidence of three illnesses common on the reservation--pneumonia, diarrhea and otitis media. The illness rates were compared with those of non-Apache siblings in the adoptive home and with those of reservation children. Adopted Apache children had more illness than their non-Apache siblings, but less than Apache children on the reservation. Particularly striking was the low rate of multiple episodes of illness for adopted Apaches compared with those on the reservation. Intensive programs are needed to improve living conditions on the reservation.
