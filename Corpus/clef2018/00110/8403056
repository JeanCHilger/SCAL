Renal transplantation with pulmonary infection. Ten cases of renal transplantations with pulmonary infection are reported. Nine cases were diagnosed by autopsy, one case clinically. Because of compromised immunological function, in these cases the causative microorganism, clinical manifestations, courses of the disease, therapies and result of the disease were different from those of ordinary pneumonia. The causative microorganisms were mainly opportunistic bacteria including virus, protozoa and fungus. During infection, symptoms were insidious and the disease disseminated rapidly, the mortality rate was high. Therefore in any case when the cause of the fever is unknown and no abnormal signs in the chest is find, it is necessary to take chest X-ray film immediately and repeatedly. Once diagnosis of pulmonary infection is established, series of bronchoscopic examination and lung biopsy are needed to find out the causative organism in order to treat the disease specifically, then the life of the patient can be saved.
