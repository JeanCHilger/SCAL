Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans pneumonia with chest wall and subphrenic abscess. A 14-year-old girl had progressive dyspnea and right lower chest pain for about 1 1/2 months and a weight loss of 3 kg in 2 months. Chest X-ray revealed right pleural effusion and a round infiltration over the right lower chest, initially suspected to be malignant. Image study revealed consolidation in the right middle and lower lobes with abscess-like lesions around the right lower pleura and transdiaphrenic involvement to the subphrenic region. The lesion had also invaded the intercostal muscle. The pleural abscess was obtained by fiberoptic thoracoscopy, and culture of the pus grew typical colonies of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. After the causative microorganism had been identified, cefoxitin was given for 2 weeks followed by oral amoxicillin (250 mg/6 h) for a total period of 3 months. Follow-up chest X-ray revealed resolution of the lung lesions and the patient recovered gradually without any sequelae.
