Incidence and pathophysiological relevance of postoperative endotoxemia. Patients who underwent surgical procedures usually develop elevated body temperature, changes of plasma levels of some proteins, and leucocytosis. These alterations are summarized as the postoperative acute-phase reaction. Also endotoxin can induce the described phenomena suggesting that endotoxin may play a role concerning the induction of the acute phase reaction. In order to test that hypothesis we determined endotoxin plasma levels preoperatively and daily postoperatively in patients who were operated on because of goiter (n = 20), colonic, pancreatic and gastric diseases (n = 58). A significant increase of endotoxin plasma levels was found at the first and third day after abdominal surgery whereas after goiter surgery the increase revealed to be only very slight. However, the decrease between the first and second postoperative day in the latter group was again statistically significant suggesting postoperative endotoxemia even after minor operations. Furthermore a correlation between the amount of circulating endotoxin and pulmonary or infectious complications could be established in patients after major operations even at the first postoperative day suggesting a pathogenetic relevance of postoperative endotoxemia.
