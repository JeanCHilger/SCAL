Respiratory manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease in pediatric patients. Respiratory manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are being recognized with increasing frequency. We present the evaluation and management of four infants and children with unusual respiratory symptoms attributed to GERD. The advantages and disadvantages of diagnostic studies of GERD are discussed, and an evaluation and treatment protocol is presented. Treatment must be tailored to the nature and severity of the patient's presenting symptoms and includes conservative, pharmacologic, and/or surgical management.
