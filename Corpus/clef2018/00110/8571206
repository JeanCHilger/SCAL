Perioperative respiratory management with fiberoptic bronchoscopy in pediatric living-related liver transplantation. Perioperative respiratory complications have been one of the largest obstacles to pediatric management of pediatric liverThe roles of fiberoptic bronchoscopy in perioperative respiratory management of pediatric liver transplantation were studied retrospectively.In a group of 162 children who underwent pediatric living-related liver transplantation, 44 underwent 222 bronchoscopic procedures for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes during the perioperative period. Major indications for bronchoscopy were atelectasis/retention of airway secretion (n = 27), pneumonia (n = 19), pulmonary edema (n = 8), airway stenosis (n = 7), and airway bleeding (n = 6). Visualization of the airway was helpful in diagnosing respiratory complications in seven infants, bronchoscopy revealed tracheobronchial stenosis that other diagnostic modalities failed to detect. In 16 of 19 patients with pneumonia, specimens taken by bronchoscopy were positive for specific pathogens. Bronchoscopy also proved to have significant therapeutic value, especially in airway cleaningFiberoptic bronchoscopy is a safe and useful modality for perioperative respiratory management in pediatric liver transplantation.
