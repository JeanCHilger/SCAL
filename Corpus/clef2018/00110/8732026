The characteristics of inhalation injury and pulmonary infection in burn patients and the influence on their mortality. 940 patients with thermal injury during the past 14 years were reviewed. Of them, inhalation injury was diagnosed in 75 patients, including 15 mild injury who all survived, 25 moderate injury, of whom 13 died with a mortality rate of 52.0% and 35 severe injury, of whom 31 died with a mortality rate of 88.6%. The data showed that 70% of burn that caused inhalation injury occurred in a closed space and 96% of which also caused facial injury. With the burn extent increasing, the incidence of inhalation injury and pulmonary infection rise correspondingly. The time and incidence of pulmonary infection in the patients with inhalation injury was earlier and higher than that in those without inhalation injury (P < 0.01). With similar burn area and age, the risk of death in the patients with inhalation injury was 17.2 times of the patients without inhalation injury (P < 0.001). Pulmonary infection further increased mortality of the patients (P < 0.001).
