Invasive disease due to Haemophilus influenzae serotype f: clinical and epidemiologic characteristics in the H. influenzae serotype b vaccine era. The Haemophilus influenzae Study Group. With the decline in the rate of infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae serotype b, H. influenzae serotype f (Hif) is becoming a relatively important cause of invasive disease due to H. influenzae. We identified 91 cases of invasive Hif infections in a multistate area over a 6-year period. The incidence of invasive Hif disease was 0.5 case per 1,000,000 population in 1989 and 1.9 cases per 1,000,000 population in 1994. The proportion of all invasive H. influenzae disease caused by Hif rose from 1% in 1989 to 17% in 1994. Seventy-two percent of cases occurred in adults, and 26% of cases occurred in children younger than 5 years of age. Respiratory tract infections accounted for 82% of adult cases, and most adults had significant underlying diseases. In children, pneumonia and meningitis each accounted for 40% of cases, respectively. Overall mortality was 30% among adults, and 21% among children. Molecular typing demonstrated limited overall diversity in Hif isolates. Continued surveillance is warranted to evaluate the trend toward the increasing incidence of Hif disease that was noted in this study.
