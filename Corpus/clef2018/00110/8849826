Ultrasound imaging of pneumonia. One hundred forty-three consecutive patients with clinically and radiologically confirmed pneumonia were examined by ultrasound. In 127 cases (88.8%), a consolidation could be visualised in the sonogram. Eight patients (5.6%) had a pleural effusion only. The remaining eight (5.6%) had no pathological findings. The characteristic features of pneumonia were a hypoechoic consolidation with numerous small hyperechoic structures (112 patients, 88.1%) and a blurred margin. In eight cases abscess formation could be detected and treated by ultrasound-guided drainage. We conclude that sonography can visualise pneumonic consolidations in a high percentage, and gives additional information concerning the diagnosis, follow-up and treatment of pneumonia.
