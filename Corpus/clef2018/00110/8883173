Neonatal pneumonia. Respiratory infections in young infants are common and can cause significant morbidity and mortality. The etiology of pneumonia in the neonate varies widely because of several modes of acquisition of infecting agents. Infants may develop pneumonia in utero as a part of a congenital infection however, more often, infants are exposed to potential pathogens in the perinatal and postnatal periods. The management of neonates with pneumonia should include diagnostic evaluation and empiric therapy directed at the organisms commonly found in the maternal genital tract, and respiratory pathogens found in the community. For premature or critically ill term infants in neonatal intensive care units, one must consider the multitude of nosocomial pathogens that colonize and cause invasive disease in these immunocompromised hosts.
