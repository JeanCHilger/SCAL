Diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia in pediatric patients by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing was performed on respiratory tract specimens obtained by throat swab in 21 children admitted to the hospital with suspected Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia. Of 13 patients with a clinical condition compatible with mycoplasma infection and an immunological response to M. pneumoniae, 11 were positive by PCR. Eight patients were negative by serology and/or had a clinical condition not compatible with mycoplasma infection, and all were negative by PCR. The antibody response to M. pneumoniae was delayed for a week or more in 3 (23%) of the 13 patients with documented mycoplasma infection. These results suggest that PCR performed on a respiratory tract specimen obtained by a throat swab may be useful in the initial evaluation of children with suspected M. pneumoniae pneumonia, especially in patients in whom the serological response is delayed.
