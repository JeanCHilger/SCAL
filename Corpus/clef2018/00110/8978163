Bronchopulmonary infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae in children. Mycoplasma pneumoniae, a gram-negative bacteria, is an important cause of lower respiratory tract infection in children (20% of cases). The infection tends to be endemic and is punctuated by epidemic episodes every 4 to 7 years. Its frequency seems to be higher in children between 5 and 9 years of age, but is probably underestimated before 5 years. M.pneumoniae may cause multisystem infection. Diagnosis is established upon clinical data and laboratory findings. Usually, the infection is associated with leucocyte count under 15,000/mL and C-reactive protein under 50 m/L. Detection of M. pneumoniae DNA in clinical samples appears to have advantages over serological tests. Severe infections have been described in patients with humoral and cellular immunodeficiencies, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis. Treatment with macrolids and tetracyclines (after 8 years of age) is indicated. Respiratory functional sequelae are possible.
