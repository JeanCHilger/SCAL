Frequency and morphology of DIC-syndrome in children in early neonatal period. Morphological study of 120 autopsy cases of newborns who died of intrauterine pneumonia, respiratory distress, hemorrhage into the brain ventricles and asphyxia revealed that in all these diseases intravascular blood coagulation develops which can be disseminated or local. Morphological manifestations of DIC-syndrome in newborns are described. The development of DIC-syndrome 18-24 hours before death is considered as a sign of compensatory-adaptive failure at the level of microcirculatory bed (type of "blood degeneration").
