A clinical evaluation of pivampicillin in childhood pneumonia. A clinical trial was done at the University Teaching (Children's) Hospital on 20 children suffering from clinical pneumonias with a specific drug regime with pivampicillin suspension. Every child was reexamined after 7-10 days of discharge from hospital. Only one chhild developed diarrhoea. There was no significant adverse drug toxicity shown in the biomedical investigations. Pivampicillin, three times a day at a dosage of 175 mg t.d.s. was found to be therapeutically effective in the treatment of childhood pneumonias.
