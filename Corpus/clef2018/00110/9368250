Appendicitis: an unusual cause of pneumonia and impending shock in a toddler. Owing to its lower incidence in young children, appendicitis is not as often thought of as a common cause of abdominal pain and vomiting in this age group. However, because of its higher incidence of morbidity (perforation and peritonitis), it should be considered in any young child with either significant abdominal pain or vomiting, even in the presence of another plausible etiology such as pneumonia.
