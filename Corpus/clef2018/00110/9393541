Pneumonia in children: decreased parenchymal contrast enhancement--CT sign of intense illness and impending cavitary necrosis. To determine if computed tomographic (CT) findings of decreased contrast material enhancement are predictive of more intense illness and of the development of cavitary necrosis in children with pneumonia.Contrast-enhanced CT scans in 44 children with pneumonia who did not respond appropriately to therapy were compared with precontrast CT scans to evaluate enhancement of consolidated lung parenchyma. Enhancement was correlated with admission to the intensive care unit, length of hospital stay, cavitary necrosis in the lung at follow-up CT, and frequency of lung resection.Parenchymal enhancement was decreased in 21 children pneumonia was enhanced in the other 23 children. Decreased enhancement was associated with increased admission to intensive care (14 of 21 [67%] vs five of 23 [22%] childrenDecreased parenchymal enhancement at CT is a predictor of more intense illness and may herald the development of cavitary necrosis in children with pneumonia.
