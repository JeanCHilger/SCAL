Multiple birth defects in a newborn exposed to Mycoplasma pneumoniae in utero. A newborn baby girl with progressive hydrocephalus and congenital defects of the skin and eyes was born to a mother who experienced bilateral bronchopneumonia in her first trimester. At the time of her infection, the mother's serum cold agglutinin titer was 1:128 and at delivery the mother's and baby's serum samples had complement-fixation titers to Mycoplasma pneumoniae of 1:1,024 and 1:256, respectively. At 1 week of age the baby's serum IgM value was 44 mg/100 ml (98% of cord IgM values in normal newborns range from 0 to 20 mg/100 ml). The baby died of progressive hydrocephalus, which may have had an inflammatory basis in view of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein level of 192 mg/100 ml. We realize that the significance of this association is questionable, but we believe that it is worthwhile to call the coincidence of events to the attention of others.
