Lung function and bacterial proliferation in experimental neonatal pneumonia in ventilated rabbits exposed to monoclonal antibody to surfactant protein A. Surfactant protein A (SP-A) increases the resistance of surfactant to inhibition by plasma and other proteins. In a previous study we found that a monoclonal anti-SP-A antibody (R 5) increased the sensitivity of surfactant to inhibition by fibrinogen in vivo and in vitro. SP-A has been shown to stimulate microbial phagocytosis and killing by alveolar macrophages. We hypothesized that using R 5 to inactivate SP-A in an animal model mimicking congenital group B streptococcal (GBS) pneumonia might result in increased bacterial proliferation and a deterioration in lung function. Newborn near term rabbits were delivered by Cesarean section, anesthetized, tracheotomized, and ventilated for 5 h in a plethysmograph system allowing measurement of dynamic lung-thorax compliance. Postnatally the animals received one intratracheal injection (5 ml/kg) of R 5, nonspecific IgG, or normal saline. At 30 min all animals received a standard dose of an encapsulated GBS strain by intratracheal injection. The number of bacteria (mean log10 CFU/g lung +/- S.D. CFU = colony forming unit) was evaluated in lung homogenates. Histologic lung sections were judged by light microscopy. Bacterial proliferation was similar in rabbits treated with the monoclonal antibody (9.33 +/- 0.39
