Inhaled nitric oxide neither alters oxidative stress parameters nor induces lung inflammation in premature lambs with moderate hyaline membrane disease. The purpose of this investigation was to examine whether inhaled nitric oxide (NO) may alter oxidative stress parameters and induce lung inflammation in moderate hyaline membrane disease (HMD). Eighteen moderately premature lambs (130 days gestation, term = 147 days) were randomly assigned to treatment with 20 ppm inhaled NO (n = 8) from the onset of ventilation or used as control (n = 10). Except inhaled NO, treatments were intentionally similar to those applied in clinical situations. The main studied parameters were oxidative stress index measurements on lung parenchyma and in circulating blood, lung parenchyma microscopic examination and bronchoalveolar lavage cell count. We found that 20 ppm of inhaled NO for 5 h did not change significantly either malondialdehyde and total antioxidant status levels in circulating blood, or malondialdehyde, reduced glutathione, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase in lung parenchyma. Amino-imino-propene bond generation, which are lipoperoxidation markers, was similar in both groups. Furthermore, no significant changes in the number of inflammatory cells in lung lavage products and in lung parenchyma microscopic examination could be found. Therefore, these data do not support the hypothesis that short-term NO inhalation increases oxidative stress and lung inflammation in an experimental model of moderate HMD.
