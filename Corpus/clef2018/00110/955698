Epidemiology of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in the United Kingdom: an analysis of reports to the Public Health Laboratory Service of England and Wales. Infection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae appears to follow a cyclic pattern in the United Kindom, with periods of increased prevalence lasting about two years. Outbreaks occurred in 1971-1972 and 1974-75, and probably also in 1967-68. Infection confirmed by laboratory tests appeared to be commonest in older children, especially those aged 5-14, and least common in adults over 65 years of age. Lower respiratory tract infection was the clinical feature most frequently reported.
