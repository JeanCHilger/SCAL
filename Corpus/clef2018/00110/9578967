Manoeuvres to elevate mean airway pressure, effects on blood gases and lung function in children with and without pulmonary pathology. During mechanical ventilation, mean airway pressure (MAP) can be increased by a variety of manoeuvres, for example increasing inspiratory time or elevating the positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP). It seemed likely that the effect on blood gases and lung function of a particular manoeuvre to increase MAP would be influenced by the presence of respiratory pathology and thus the manoeuvre best at improving respiratory status in children with an abnormal chest radiograph appearance would differ from that most efficacious in children without such a problem. The aim of this study was to test that hypothesis. Twenty-two children, median age 15 months (range 2.5 weeks-10 years) were examined. Group 1 (n = 10) had no chest radiograph abnormalities and group 2 (n = 12) lobar collapse and/or consolidation. The patients were studied at baseline settings and at an elevated MAP resulting from (in random order) an increase in inspiratory time (T1), pressure PEEP or peak inspiratory pressure (PIP). In group 1, elevating PIP improved oxygenation and carbon dioxide elimination (P < 0.01) and prolonging T1 improved oxygenation (P < 0.05). In group 2, only raising PEEP significantly improved oxygenation (P < 0.01), but this was associated with carbon dioxide retention (P < 0.01).The presence of lung pathology does influence which manoeuvre should be used to elevate MAP to improve blood gases in the paediatric population.
