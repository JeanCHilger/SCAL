Dexamethasone enhancement of hyperoxic lung inflammation in rats independent of adhesion molecule expression. Infants and adults on oxygen often are treated with glucocorticoids in an attempt to reduce lung inflammatory injury. However, glucocorticoids hasten the development of hyperoxic lung injury in some animal models. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that dexamethasone alters the lung inflammatory responses to hyperoxia exposure. We studied male Sprague-Dawley rats, placing them in >95% oxygen immediately after administration of 0, 0.1, 1, or 10 mg/kg of dexamethasone. At 0, 24, or 48 hr of exposure to hyperoxia, extravascular lung water contents were measured, and lung inflammatory responses were assessed by lung myeloperoxidase activities, lung neutrophil counts, and lung expression of E-Selectin and intercellular adhesions molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Dexamethasone, independent of exposure to hyperoxia, led to marked increases in lung neutrophil counts, without increases in lung myeloperoxidase activities or increases in the expression of the adhesion molecules. Hyperoxia exposure also enhanced lung neutrophil accumulation, and extravascular lung water increased earlier in animals exposed to hyperoxia and dexamethasone than in those exposed to hyperoxia alone. In conclusion, the increase in lung neutrophils in dexamethasone-treated rats without enhanced expression of E-Selectin or intracellular adhesions molecule-1 suggests that dexamethasone leads to lung neutrophil accumulation by its effect on neutrophils. The more rapid development of hyperoxic lung injury associated with earlier lung neutrophil accumulation suggests that dexamethasone-induced lung neutrophil sequestration primes the lung for the development of hyperoxic lung injury and supports further the conclusion that lung inflammation contributes significantly to the development of hyperoxic lung injury.
