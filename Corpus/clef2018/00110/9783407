The etiology of sporadic acute pneumonia in children. The complex microbiological study of tracheobronchial washings and the detection of antibodies to surface components of whole bacterial cells in the indirect fluorescence test permitted the determination of the pneumococcal etiology of acute pneumonia (AP) in 134 children aged 1 month to 13 years (97.1%). In the course of AP 13 patients (9.4%) were found to have acute infectious processes caused by Haemophilus influenzae (5 cases), different enterobacteria (4 cases), Moraxella catarrhalis (2 cases), as well acute infectious destruction of the lungs and pyopneumothorax (1 case), whose etiological factors were Staphylococcus aureus and nontyping H. influenzae strains.
