Comparative clinical study of cefonicid, chloramphenicol, and penicillin in community-acquired pneumonia. Community-acquired pneumonia is one of the most common infectious conditions that require hospitalization. When intravenous treatment is indicated, cefonicid is usually the drug of choice. The aim of this study was to find out if chloramphenicol, which is superior to the standard drugs from a financial point of view, could serve as an equally efficient treatment, especially in the elderly. The outcomes of 3 pneumonia patient groups who were either treated with cefonicid, chloramphenicol or penicillin-G (n = 59, 17, 24, respectively) were retrospectively compared. Data about demographic characteristics of the patients, clinical outcomes, rehospitalization rates, duration of improvement/treatment/ hospitalization and clinical laboratory tests were obtained from each patient's medical records. Only minor differences (even though occasionally significant) were found with respect to rehospitalization and improvement rates, duration of hospitalization, treatment and improvement, death rates and clinical laboratory tests. However, chloramphenicol patients were found to be significantly older than cefonicid patients. Moreover, no bone-marrow suppression was associated with chloramphenicol treatment. All 3 drugs tested seem to have the same efficacy. We conclude that since chloramphenicol is as safe as, and much cheaper than cefonicid, this antibiotic agent is not inferior to the others, its usage in older patients with pneumonia should be considered.
