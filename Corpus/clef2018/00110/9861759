Bronchiolitis obliterans organising pneumonia. A report of 11 cases and a review of the literature. The clinical syndrome "Bronchiolitis Obliterans Organising Pneumonia" (BOOP) has to be considered in patients with a flu-like illness since some weeks, fine crackles, and on chest X-ray bilateral patchy infiltrates. There is no response to antibiotics. BOOP is essentially idiopathic, but associations to other conditions exist. Lung function is often restrictive biochemistry is not pathognomonic. BAL shows a mixed cellular pattern. The gold standard for pathologic diagnosis is open or thoracoscopic lung biopsy. However, a BOOP pattern or reaction is often seen on histologic specimens without the clinical-radiologic features of the BOOP-entity. Therapy consists of corticosteroids, which have to be prescribed for a long time at a rather high dose. Recurrence is frequent, but prognosis is good. Evolution to respiratory insufficiency and death is rare and may occur in rapidly progressive BOOP. This study reports on 11 cases (6 males/5 females) of clinical-pathological BOOP-syndrome (mean age 58 yrs, range 17-73 yrs), with an unexpectedly high mortality rate of 36% (4 cases). The disease was idiopathic in 7, and was associated with intake of amiodarone (in 1), with past Mycoplasma pneumonia (in 1) and with connective tissue disease (in 2). There was a history of a flu-like syndrome, cough and dyspnea of a mean duration of 4 months (range 1 week to 8 months). Lung function was mostly restrictive or/and obstructive with a diffusing capacity ranging between 47 and 95% predicted
