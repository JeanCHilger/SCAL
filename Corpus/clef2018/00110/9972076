Isolation of pathogenic bacteria from induced sputum from hospitalized children with pneumonia in Bangladesh. A prospective study was carried out on 157 patients admitted to a paediatric hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh to determine the bacteria present in the induced sputum of paediatric patients with X-ray proven pneumonia.
