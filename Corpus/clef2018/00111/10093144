The role of pulmonary inflammation in the development of pulmonary hypertension in newborn with meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS). 1. There was no clear correlation between the tracheal aspirate cytokines and the elevation of pulmonary arterial pressure in newborn piglets with MAS. The use of dexamethasone significantly suppressed tracheal aspirate cytokines but did not significantly alter pulmonary arterial pressure. Dexamethasone significantly increased the cardiac stroke volume and blood pressure. 2. Early dexamethasone therapy (< 12 hrs) for one week in infants with MAS significantly improved pulmonary ventilation and facilitated weaning from mechanical ventilation. 3. The mechanisms for the improvement in cardiopulmonary status following early dexamethasone therapy in MAS remain unclear. An overall improvement in cardiac hemodynamics, along with a significant decrease in lung inflammation may be responsible for the improvement.
