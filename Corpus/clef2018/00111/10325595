The comparison of selenium status between the children suffered from pneumonia and the normal children from kindergarten. In order to investigate the relationship between selenium (Se) status and pneumonia children, the levels of Se and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in plasma and white blood cells and Se content in urine were determined in 57 cases with pneumonia and 85 control children under 10 years old. The results showed that the levels of Se and GSH-Px in plasma and white blood cell in the group of pneumonia were significantly lower, but the content of Se in urine was higher. Se content and GSH-Px activity in white blood cells of patients during crisis were significantly lower than those of patients during convalescence.
