Relapsing pneumonia due to a migrating intrathoracic foreign body in a World War II veteran shot 53 years ago. In the great majority of cases of long-standing intrathoracic foreign bodies, patients are asymptomatic. However, symptoms may occur years later from the migration of the foreign body. We report on a 70-year-old patient who developed relapsing pneumonia due to obstruction of a bronchial branch of the left apical group by a migrating infantry bullet impacting 53 years ago. This was not diagnosed until the second attack of pneumonia in 1998. The bullet remains were removed bronchoscopically and the pneumonia resolved completely without further complications.
