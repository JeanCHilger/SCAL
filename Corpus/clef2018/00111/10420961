Utility of bronchoalveolar lavage in the diagnosis of respiratory infection in HIV patients. From January 1, 1992, to December 31, 1995, we studied 52 bronchoalveolar lavages in 45 HIV-infected patients. All patients with pulmonary symptoms and/or new pulmonary infiltrates underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) when the results of blood cultures and mycobacterial smears of sputum and urine were negative. Lavage fluid was investigated for the presence of P. carinii, bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi and virus. BAL was diagnostic in 39 (75%) cases. The organisms more frequently isolated were P. carinii and M. tuberculosis. Only one pathogen was identified in 28 cases (54%) two in ten (19%)
