Acute lower respiratory infections in hospitalized children over a 6 year period in Tokyo. Acute lower respiratory infections are major causes of hospitalization in children and are mainly caused by respiratory viruses. In the present study, we investigated the etiologic agents responsible for acute lower respiratory infections from the period November 1986 to October 1992 in order to determine the seasonal pattern and different characteristics of age distribution of respiratory infectious agents, mainly virus infections.A total of 1521 patients with lower respiratory infections was hospitalized in Saiseikai Central Hospital, Tokyo, Japan. Nasopharyngeal secretions were obtained for virus isolation and paired sera in the acute and convalescent phases were obtained for serological examination.Etiological agents were identified in 668 of 1521 patients (43.9%) by serological antibody responses, virus isolation and/or detection of virus antigen: 240 (15.8%) with respiratory syncytial (RS) virus 62 (4.1%) with influenza virus type AVirological epidemiology provides useful information in daily clinical practice for the prediction of etiological agents based on patient age and the seasonal distribution of agents. We should examine virus isolation and the detection of virus antigen, along with serological examinations in patients with respiratory infections, especially in infants younger than 1 year of age because of poor serological responses.
