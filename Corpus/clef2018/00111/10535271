A case of Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma pneumoniae coinfection in a child. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection is often experienced as community-acquired pneumonia, whereas Chlamydia trachomatis pneumonia is sometimes experienced as a vertical infection from mother to child through delivery, but is rare after six months of age. We reported the first case to date of a seven-year-old boy with coinfection of C. trachomatis and M. pneumoniae. The patient, who was referred to our hospital because of suspected pneumonia, had had severe cough and pyrexia for four days before his admission. The coinfection was confirmed because the antibodies to both bacteria were significantly increased. In addition the PCR for C. trachomatis detected the presence of C. trachomatis in the throat even after treatment. The PCR from a cervix swab of his mother and from a throat swab of his father were negative, but their antibodies to C. trachomatis were positive. We think that this may have been community-acquired pneumonia or due to persistent infection after a vertical transmission.
