Pulmonary function in children of school age is related to the number of siblings in their family. It has been suggested that the number of siblings in a family is a surrogate variable for exposure to early infections. Since there may be an association between early respiratory infections and impaired lung function in later life, the aim of this study was to elucidate the relationship between the number of siblings and pulmonary function. We analyzed pulmonary function data from 677 schoolchildren living in 431 nuclear families. Our results show that forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) expressed as a percentage of deviation from the predicted values (FVC%, FEV(1)%) increase significantly in line with the number of siblings in a family (FVC%: no sibling = reference, 1 sibling = +1.3%, 2 siblings = +1.9%, 3 siblings = +4.0%, 4 or more siblings = +5.1% P-value for trend = 0.01
