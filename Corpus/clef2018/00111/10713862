Multicenter randomized trial comparing meropenem (1.5 g daily) and imipenem/cilastatin (2 g daily) in the hospital treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. An open, multicenter study with 144 patients, aged between 18 and 94 years, was performed to compare the efficacy and safety of meropenem with imipenem/cilastatin in the hospital treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. Patients were randomized to receive either intravenous meropenem (500 mg every 8 h) or intravenous imipenem/cilastatin (1,000 mg every 12 h). The primary end point was considered to be clinical efficacy and the secondary end points were bacteriological response and safety assessment. At the end of therapy, cure or improvement in signs and symptoms as a satisfactory clinical response was observed in 57 of 64 (89.1%) meropenem-treated patients and in 60 of 66 (90.9%) imipenem/cilastatin patients. The mean duration of treatment was 10 days for meropenem and 9.7 days for imipenem/cilastatin. In patients who were followed up for weeks 2-4, the response was satisfactory (100%) for both treatments. A satisfactory bacteriological response, defined as either presumed or confirmed eradication of all pathogens, was found in eight patients who had received meropenem and in 14 patients who had received imipenem/cilastatin. Response was considered satisfactory in 100% of the meropenem group and in 92.9% of the imipenem/cilastatin group and at follow-up, it was 100% for both treatments. Drug-related adverse events were reported in three (4.2%) meropenem-treated patients and in eight (11.0%) imipenem/cilastatin-treated patients. None of these events was classified as serious. The results of this study show that the clinical and bacteriological efficacy and tolerability of meropenem (500 mg every 8 h) are similar to that of imipenem/cilastatin (1,000 mg every 12 h) in the hospital treatment of community-acquired pneumonia.
