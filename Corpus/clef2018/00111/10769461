Significance of hereditary factors in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome in children with infections. In order to elucidate the contribution of hereditary factor (dose of ribosome genes) to the realization of organ dysfunction syndromes in children with surgical infection, the total size of silver nitrate-stained nucleoli-forming regions (Ag-NFR) of acrocentric chromosomes in karyotypes was assessed in 22 patients aged from 14 months to 12 years, 17 of these with appendicular peritonitis, 4 with destructive pneumonia, and 1 with acute hematogenic osteomyelitis. Pyoseptic diseases involved no organ dysfunction in 10 patients, and in 12, multiple organ dysfunction was diagnosed. Our findings indicate that the carriers of low-copy variants of ribosome genes are characterized by hereditary predisposition to lowered individual resistance of the organism. Therefore, children with surgical infection with a decreased size of Ag-NFR (low dose of ribosome genes) in the karyotype potentially represent a group at risk of multiple organ dysfunction realization.
