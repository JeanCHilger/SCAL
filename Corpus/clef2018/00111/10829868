Acute chest syndrome in children with sickle cell disease. Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is an acute pulmonic process in patients with sickle cell disease. We prospectively studied 50 patients with ACS admitted to the Pediatric Medical Ward during one year period (Jan. 1993 through Dec. 1993). Twenty eight of them were males and twenty two were females giving a male: female ratio of 1.2:1. The age ranged between one and 12 years. Twelve (24%) of the patients had chest pain on presentation. Twenty seven (54%) patients had significant temperature (> 38 degrees C). The x-ray findings showed that the right lung was involved in 30 patients, the left in 10 patients and both lungs in 10 patients. Three patients had pleural effusion that required chest tube insertion. Laboratory profiles showed that the erythrocyte sedimentation rate ranged between 15 and 90 mm/h, and their hemoglobin ranged between 4.2 gm and 12 gm/dl. Seven (14%) patients had significantly positive mycoplasma pneumoniae titer. None of the blood cultures was positive. All of our patient received antibiotic, usually either Cefuroxime or Ceftriaxone with Erythromycin in addition to other supportive measures such as blood transfusion, oxygen therapy and hydration therapy.
