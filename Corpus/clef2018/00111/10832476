Sino-bronchial syndrome in children with asthma. Thirty children in the age group of 2 to 12 years were brought with a history of recurrent non-seasonal moderate to severe wheezy episodes associated with symptoms of nasal congestion, sneezing and occasional headache. All of them had maxillary or pan sinusitis with 26 having associated right, left or bilateral lower lobe pneumonitis or bronchiectasis. Serum immunoglobulins were normal in 22 and was not done in eight. There was positive (2 to 4+ above negative control) skin test response to dust and dust mite in 15 of the 22 children tested. Throat swabs/sputum or nasal secretions grew B-hemolytic streptococcus or streptococcus pneumoniae in twenty-seven. All the children were put on bactericidal drugs for 6 to 8 weeks and bronchodilators were used when needed. At the end of 6 to 8 weeks follow-up X-ray of sinuses and chest showed significant clearing of the lesions which coincided with marked clinical improvement. Sinus X-ray should be considered in bronchial asthma resistant to medical management since untreated bacterial sinusitis can be an underlying cause of chronic poorly controlled asthma.
