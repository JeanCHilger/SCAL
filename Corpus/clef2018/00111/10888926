Successful DNA immunization against measles: neutralizing antibody against either the hemagglutinin or fusion glycoprotein protects rhesus macaques without evidence of atypical measles. Measles remains a principal cause of worldwide mortality, in part because young infants cannot be immunized effectively. Development of new vaccines has been hindered by previous experience with a formalin-inactivated vaccine that predisposed to a severe form of disease (atypical measles). Here we have developed and tested potential DNA vaccines for immunogenicity, efficacy and safety in a rhesus macaque model of measles. DNA protected from challenge with wild-type measles virus. Protection correlated with levels of neutralizing antibody and not with cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity. There was no evidence in any group, including those receiving hemagglutinin-encoding DNA alone, of 'priming' for atypical measles.
