Lower respiratory tract infections in adolescents. Lower respiratory tract infections are an important cause of morbidity and occasional mortality in adolescents. This article reviews lower respiratory tract infections by anatomic location. Laryngotracheitis, tracheitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, and parapneumonic effusions are discussed. Specific viral, bacterial, mycoplasmal, and chlamydial etiologies are discussed. The epidemiology and clinical manifestations of lower respiratory tract infections in adolescents are presented according to anatomic site. Treatment for the spectrum of lower respiratory tract infections is also reviewed. Treatment options include supportive care, humidification, corticosteroids, antivirals, antibiotics, and appropriate drainage. Appropriate drainage of parapneumonic effusions includes thoracentesis, closed-tube thoracostomy, and surgery (thoracoscopy or thoracotomy). Imaging modalities include conventional radiography, computed tomography, and ultrasonography. Emphasis is placed on the common lower respiratory tract infections that affect the normal adolescent population.
