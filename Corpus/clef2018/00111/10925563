Clinical spectrum of acute respiratory distress syndrome in a tertiary referral hospital: etiology, severity, clinical course, and hospital outcome. The clinical picture of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in Taiwan has seldom been reported, although new definitions of ARDS have been introduced over the past years. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics, modalities of management, and outcomes in patients with ARDS treated in a tertiary referral hospital.Case records were selected through a computerized search of diagnosis codified at discharge during the period from January 1995 to June 1997. Patients who met the criteria of the American-European Consensus Conference definition of ARDS were included and their medical records were retrospectively reviewed.A total of 145 patients (91 men, 54 women mean age, 58 years) who fulfilled the criteria for ARDS were identified. Malignancy (n = 53) and diabetes mellitus (n = 23) were the most common co-morbid conditions. Pneumonia (n = 90), including community-acquired pneumonia in 45 (31%) patients, was the most common risk factor. The lung injury score at the time of ARDS diagnosis was 2.89 +/- 0.40 (mean +/- standard error, SE). The worst value of PaO2/FIO2 was 86.8 +/- 3.8 mm Hg (mean +/- SE). Among the 145 patients, 130 (90%) received mechanical ventilation and 118 (81%) were treated in the intensive care unit. In-hospital mortality was 87%. Seventy (48%) patients received intensive treatment for ARDS, among whom 52 (74%) diedThe mortality in patients with ARDS was high in this tertiary referral institution. Our findings suggest that aggressive ventilatory, pharmacologic, and supportive therapy may be important to achieve a higher survival rate.
