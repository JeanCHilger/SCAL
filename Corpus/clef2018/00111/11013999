Nosocomial pneumonia in patients with severe craniocerebral trauma in intensive care units. Eighty-three patients with severe craniocerebral injuries (CCI) were treated at Institute of Neurosurgery in 1999. Pulmonary infectious complications occurred in 16 of 25 patients with severe CCI. Early nosocomial pneumonia (NP) was diagnosed in 18% and the so-called late NP (associated with artificial ventilation of the lungs) in 35%. Coma longer than 4 days increased the incidence of NP to 62%. The main pathogens of NP are gram-negative aerobic bacteria (61%), the predominant agent being Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18.9%). 76% isolated microorganisms were multiresistant. The most significant risk factors as regards NP in patients with severe CCI were coma combined with bulbar and pseudobulbar disorders.
