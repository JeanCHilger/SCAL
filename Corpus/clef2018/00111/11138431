Evaluation of the American Academy of Pediatrics Principles on Management of Common Office Infections in a managed care setting. The American Academy of Pediatrics has outlined principles for management of common office infections. We evaluated the impact of these principles at St. John's Health System. Study design was a pre and post guideline analysis of claims data and a randomized chart review. There was a high baseline compliance present with the AAP recommendations. There was a 33.5% increase in the use of throat cultures or streptococcal agglutination screens for diagnosis of upper respiratory infections (p = .001) and an 86% decrease in the use of sinus films (p < .001). We conclude that the AAP principles resulted in a significant change in clinical practice.
