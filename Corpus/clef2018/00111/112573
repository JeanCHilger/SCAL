Meningococcal group Y pneumonia in an adolescent female. Neisseria meningitidis group Y has been considered to be an uncommon pathogen. Meningococcal group Y disease has recently been reported with increased frequency in military training camps coincident with the routine use of meningococcal group C vaccine. Pneumonia produced by the group Y organism may mimic disease caused by common respiratory tract pathogens, and isolation by routine methods may be difficult. A 16-year-old asthmatic female developed lobar pneumonia secondary to N meningitidis group Y while on alternate day steroids. We speculate that neither steroid therapy nor an isolated serum IgA deficiency in the presence of secretory IgA discovered after her recovery predisposed her to sinopulmonary disease. The true incidence of group Y disease is unknown. Awareness of its potential pathogenicity may have clinical significance with the availability of a group Y vaccine.
