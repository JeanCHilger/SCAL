C reactive protein as marker of infection among patients with severe closed trauma. Injury and infection are characterized by the activation of the acute phase proteins response. C-reactive protein (CRP), an acute phase protein, has been mentioned as an useful indicator of infection and sepsis in critically ill patients.To study the evolution of serum CRP in patients with severe blunt trauma and to ascertain its ability as a biological marker of infection during the first seven days after injury.We prospectively studied 54 patients with blunt trauma (injury severity score>=16) age>14 years and length of the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) estay>= 7 days, over a 4-month period. Culture-proven infections were collected and serum CRP was determinated every day, during the first week after ICU admission.Twenty-eight patients (51.8%) developed an infection during the first week, and the median day of diagnosis of infection was day 6. Pneumonia was the most common infection (50%) and Gram-negative bacilli (63.3%) were the most common microorganisms recovered. Serum CRP levels were significantly higher in the infected patients group after day 4, showing a median value higher than 170 mg/l. Based on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, a cutoff value of 109.5 mg/l for CRP gives a sensitivity of 78.6% and a specifity of 73.1% in predicting the presence of infection.The course of serum CRP levels is different in the group of patients with severe blunt trauma and infection, compared with the non-infected group during the first week after injury and it could be an useful supplementary marker for infection after postinjury day 4. A value of 110 mg/l or higher for CRP should suggest an underlying infectious complication.
