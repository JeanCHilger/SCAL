Etiology, reasons for hospitalization, risk classes, and outcomes of community-acquired pneumonia in patients hospitalized on the basis of conventional admission criteria. We performed an observational analysis of prospectively collected data on 533 nonseverely immunosuppressed adult patients who were hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia on the basis of conventional admission criteria. For this population, we correlated etiology, reasons for admission, and outcomes using the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), to identify major discrepancies between the PSI risk class and the conventional criteria for deciding the site of care. PSI classes and corresponding mortality rates were as follows: class I, 51 patients (0%) class II, 62 (2%)
