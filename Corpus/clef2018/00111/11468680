Pulmonary involvement in children with AIDS: clinical study and necropsy of 14 cases. To describe clinical, laboratorial, radiological, and histopathological lung findings from necroscopy of aidetic children with pulmonary disease.Fourteen children admitted at the Hospital Universitário Antônio Pedro - Universidade Federal Fluminense, Niterói, RJ, and Instituto de Puericultura e Pediatria Martagão Gesteira - Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, between 1989 and 1996, were revised in a retrospective survey.Eight were males (57%). The median age was 1.2 years old (from three months to nine years). Nine children (64.4%) were younger than 24 months old. The HIV transmission was vertical in 10 (71%) children. In these cases, five mothers were contaminated from heterosexual relations. Pneumonia (n=8), oral candidiasis (n=8), and diarrhea (n=5) were the most common previous conditions. The most frequent signs and symptoms on admission were fever (n=12), respiratory distress (n=10), cough (n=10), peripheral lymphadenopathy (n=11), hepatomegaly and/or splenomegaly (n=10), and malnutrition (n=9). The chest x-rays findings were condensation (n=5) and diffuse infiltrates (n=6) patterns. The microscopic lung characteristics were compatibles with pneumonia by cytomegalovirus (CMV) (n=9), bacteria (n=8), Pneumocystis carinii (n=3), Toxoplasma gondii (n=1), Hystoplasma capsulatum (n=1) and Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (n=1). The association between CMV and bacteria was observed in six cases.Age less than two years old, vertical transmission, inespecific clinical presentation of pneumonia, and infiltrates and condensation patterns at the x-rays were the predominant characteristics. Cytomegalovirus and bacteria were the most common etiologic agents, being their association frequent. Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia and pneumonia by P. carinii were not common causes of pulmonary disease.
