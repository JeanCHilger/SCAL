Microbial intestinal disturbances in children with frequent acute complicated pneumonia. In the investigation designed to study intestinal microflora in children with acute complicated pneumonia having developed against the background of frequently recurring diseases such as acute respiratory infections, 91.1 percent of pediatric examinees demonstrated microecologocal disturbances in the intestines, with grade III dysbacteriosis in 46.6 percent. In that case the enterocolitic syndrome in pneumonia should be regarded as a clinical manifestation of disturbances in biocenosis of the intestines, in the functional capability of its microflora. Intestinal dysbacteriosis aggravates the course of acute complicated pneumonia in children at early ages and warrants a purposive therapy normalizing the intestinal microflora.
