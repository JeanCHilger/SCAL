Clinical "pneumococcal pneumonia" due to Moraxella osloensis: case report and a review. A previously healthy 6-y-old girl presented with a disease very similar to pneumococcal pneumonia. However, Moraxella osloensis was isolated by lung tap. The patient responded well to a course of parenteral penicillin. This is probably the first documented case of community-acquired pneumonia associated with this agent. Clinical isolates of M. osloensis are rare and its pathogenesis has not been delineated however, a literature review suggests that the organism is more common than is generally recognized.
