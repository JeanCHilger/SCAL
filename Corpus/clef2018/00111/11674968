Community acquired pneumonia in patients older than 60 years. Incidence of atypical agents and clinical-radiological progression. Seventy five patients older than 60 years with a community acquired pneumonia followed up in an outpatient clinic, were prospectively studied in order to determine the incidence of atypical agents, clinical-radiological characteristics, progression and the differences with pneumonia in younger patients.Clinical-radiological evaluation protocols were activated in the first visit and in two subsequent controls. Etiological diagnosis was made by means of serology (in the first visit and three weeks later).Initially, 85 patients older than 60 years were included of which 75 non hospitalized were fully followed up. Also, in the comparative study, 216 outpatient clinic patients 60 years old or younger were followed up during the same period. In the first group the frequency of atypical agents was 33.3%. The most frequently isolated bacteria was Coxiella burnetii (13.3%)followed by virus and Legionella pneumophila. No case of Mycoplasma pneumoniae was diagnosed. The most frequent radiological onset was alveolar infiltrate (85%). The comparative study between the two populations (older or younger than 60 years), found few clinical differences (dyspnea more frequent in older,feverish chill in younger) and auscultation (crackles more frequent in older). We did not find differences remaining clinical-radiological or laboratory data. Most patients presented a favourable clinical and radiological progression. Only 2 patients needed hospital admission (2.7%).In outpatient clinic patients older than 60 years with community acquired pneumonia a high number of atypical agents have been found. The clinical-radiological evolution was satisfactory for most of them. Age was not a decisive element in determining hospital admissions.
