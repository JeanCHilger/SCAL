Serum concentrations of trace elements and microcirculation during laser therapy for pneumonia. The impact of laser therapy in the multimodality treatment for pneumonia on the serum levels of trace elements and microcirculation was studied. A total of 105 patients with pneumonia were examined. The patients were divided into 2 groups: 1) 68 patients received laser therapy and 2) 37 patients took drug therapy alone. There was a more substantial reduction in the permeability of cellular membranes, a significant increase in the serum levels of iron and chromium, better circulation at the expense of a vascular component. The above changes highly correlated with laboratory data and external respiratory function parameters.
