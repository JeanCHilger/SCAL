Therapy of bacterial infections in infancy and childhood (author's transl). 83 in-patients, age 3 months to 12 years, with tonsillitis, otitis, bronchitis and pneumonia were treated with a new galenic preparation of phenoxymethylpenicillin V potassium (Star-Pen Trockensirus SANABO). The drug was very well tolerated, no skin-rash was observed, no problems occurred with the oral administration. Diarrhea, not infrequent in oral penicillin therapy, was -- with one exception -- not noticed in patients above one year of age.
