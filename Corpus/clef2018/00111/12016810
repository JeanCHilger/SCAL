Changes of glutamate and GABA in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with pneumonia complicated with central nervous system damage. Glutamate(Glu), gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA), and malondialdehyde(MDA) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were measured in 18 children with pneumonia complicated with central nervous system(CNS) damage, 14 children with pneumonia without CNS damage, and 7 children with hypocalcemic tetany. The concentration of Glu and MDA and the ratio of Glu/GABA in CSF of pneumonia without CNS damage were significantly higher than the others. The ratio of Glu/GABA in CSF of the children with pneumonia with consciousness obstacle after convulsion was higher than that without consciousness obstacle after convulsion. These results suggest that Glu and free radicals may play a critical role in the CNS damage caused by pneumonia, however GABA may reduce the CNS damage caused by pneumonia.
