Efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin in the prevention of pneumonia in patients with common variable immunodeficiency. Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is a primary immune disorder characterized by antibody deficiency and a decrease in serum IgG and IgA, IgM, or both levels at least 2 SDs below the mean for age and not attributed to other known immunologic disorders. These patients often present with frequent and severe episodes of pneumonia before diagnosis. The standard treatment, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), has been available for the past 20 years. No large-scale study has compared the incidence of pneumonia in these patients before and after IVIG treatment.The aim of this study was to document the effectiveness of intravenous immunoglobulin treatment on the incidence of pneumonia in patients with CVID.We performed chart reviews and interviews of patients with laboratory-confirmed CVID seen at our clinical center. The number of episodes of pneumonia was documented before and after treatment with immunoglobulin replacement therapy.The histories of 50 patients were reviewed (mean current age, 42 +/- 16.3 years age range, 10-78 yearsThe treatment of CVID with IVIG significantly reduces the incidence of pneumonia.
