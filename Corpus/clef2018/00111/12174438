Pneumonia due to Legionella pneumophila in an immunocompromised child. A one-year-and-seven-months-old boy was hospitalised because of fever, cough and general malaise. A diagnosed tonsillitis and pneumonia were treated with intravenous antibiotics. His clinical condition worsened despite antibiotic therapy. After immunologic investigations revealed both a cellular and a humoral immune disorder, a broncho-alveolar lavage was performed. The culture revealed Legionella pneumophila. Antibiotic treatment was then changed to erythromycin in combination with rifampicin, with a good response. Although rarely described in childhood, one should consider L. pneumophila as a possible pathogen in immunocompromised children presenting with pneumonia.
