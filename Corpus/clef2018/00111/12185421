Associations between empirical antimicrobial therapy at the hospital and mortality in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia. The aim of the study was to examine different antibiotic choices and their relation to outcomes.We reviewed patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia (SCAP) from two multicenter studies. Empirical antimicrobial regimens were classified as: macrolides alone (group M) macrolides plus betalactams (group MB)Initial distribution of regimens was: group MB: 261 patients group A: 65 patientsClinicians select the empirical antibiotic regimen after classifying patients according to likely pathogens and prognosis. The inclusion of a macrolide as part of the initial therapeutic regimen for SCAP appears to be as safe and effective as alternative options. Addition of a macrolide agent to a betalactam/betalactamase inhibitor or using a macrolide alone was a marker for less severe disease.
