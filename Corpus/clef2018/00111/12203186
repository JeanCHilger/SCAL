Pythium insidiosum pleuropericarditis complicating pneumonia in a child with leukemia. We describe a 12-year-old boy with acute myeloid leukemia who developed pleuropericarditis while he was neutropenic and was receiving intravenously administered antibiotic and antifungal therapy for pneumonia. A KOH preparation of the purulent material from an extensive diagnostic and therapeutic pleuropericardial drainage procedure revealed multiple irregularly septate hyphae, and cultures yielded the organism Pythium insidiosum. After completing a 12-month course of intravenously administered liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome Fujisawa Healthcare) and itraconazole, the patient remained alive, in clinical remission, and symptom free.
