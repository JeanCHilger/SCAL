Respiratory infections and asthma. What we know: Respiratory viral infections caused by rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, influenza, parainfluenza and respiratory syncytial viruses (RSVs) are important triggers of asthma attacks. Mycoplasma and Chlamydia infections can also provoke asthma attacks, although less commonly. RSV infections probably do not cause asthma, but are potent triggers of wheezing, with the result that RSV infection often reveals underlying asthma in children. RSV infection does not cause atopy. Bacterial respiratory infections in infancy appear to protect against later atopy. What we need to know: Does RSV infection in infancy alter a child's T(H)1/T(H)2 responses to later infections with other respiratory pathogens? What are the mechanisms (immunological or mechanical) by which respiratory pathogens cause wheezing? What is the role of respiratory infections in exacerbations of asthma? Can epidemiology shed light on this? Do viruses such as RSV cause asthma or uncover underlying asthma? Do children respond differently to RSV than to other viruses? Does atopy affect those responses? Do bacterial respiratory infections truly protect against future atopy?
