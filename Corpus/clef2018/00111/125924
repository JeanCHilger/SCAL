Hypersensitivity pneumonitis, a disease caused by repetitive inhalation of nonviable organic dust, is increasingly recognized as a cause of acute and chronic lung disease in both children and adults.

The clinical manifestations, pathology, differential diagnosis, treatment, and immunologic aspects of the disease are reviewed.
