A case of pneumonia due to coinfection by Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae. Few cases of Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae coinfection in pneumonia have been reported in adults. We report a case of such a double infection in a young adult. A 16-year-old boy was admitted to our hospital with dry cough and fever. Laboratory findings revealed elevated serum GOT and GPT levels. The patient had been administered a beta-lactam antibiotic before admission to our hospital. Antibodies to M. pneumoniae were significantly elevated. Titers of IgM and IgG specific for C. pneumoniae titer were high, as measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. The patient was treated with clarithromycin and discharged after a satisfactory recovery. M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae may act as cofactors in community-acquired pneumonia. Further studies are needed to clarify the relationships of these pathogens to community-acquired pneumonia.
