Radiation and endoscopic diagnosis of pneumonia. The authors analyze the results of different types of radiation and endoscopic studies of 151 patients with pneumonia with an established etiological agent. There is a correlation of X-ray semiotics and endoscopic changes with the clinical manifestation and causative agent of the disease. When the studies are combined, emphasis is laid on the role of endoscopy in verifying the diagnosis, in specifying an etiological agent, and in implementing therapeutical measures to prevent complications. An algorithm of radiation imaging techniques is proposed to examine patients with pneumonia and of their purpose-oriented use according to the task set.
