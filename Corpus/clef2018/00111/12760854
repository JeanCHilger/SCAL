Worldwide assessment of linezolid's clinical safety and tolerability: comparator-controlled phase III studies. Linezolid, an oxazolidinone antibiotic, has 100% oral bioavailability and favorable activities against gram-positive pathogens including multidrug-resistant staphylococci, enterococci, and pneumococci. Safety assessments were conducted for 2,046 linezolid-treated patients and 2,001 comparator drug-treated patients from seven controlled clinical trials comparing the activities of linezolid and comparator drugs against nosocomial and community-acquired pneumonia, skin and skin structure infections, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcal infections. Drug-related adverse events were primarily transient. The most frequent (> or = 2%) adverse events caused by linezolid and the comparator drugs were diarrhea (4.3 and 3.2%, respectively P = 0.074), nausea (3.4 and 2.3%, respectively
