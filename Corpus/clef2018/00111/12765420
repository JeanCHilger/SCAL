Chlamydia species as a cause of community-acquired pneumonia in Canada. Chlamydia pneumoniae has been implicated as a cause of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in several studies. However, there has been no comprehensive study of the role of Chlamydia species (C. pneumoniae, C. psittaci (avian and feline strains) and C. pecorum) as a cause of CAP. The aim of the present study was to determine the role of C. pneumoniae, C. psittaci and C. pecorum as causes of CAP. A prospective cohort observational study of CAP was conducted at 15 teaching centres in eight Canadian provinces between January 1996-October 1997. Acute (n=539) and convalescent (n=272) serum samples were obtained for determination of antibody titres to C. pneumoniae, C. psittaci, C. pecorum, C. trachomatis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila serogroups I-VI, Streptococcus pneumoniae and various respiratory viruses. Twelve of 539 (2.2%) patients had acute C. pneumoniae pneumonia and an additional 32 (5.9%) had possible acute infection. C. pneumoniae was the sole pathogen in 16 of 42 (38.1%) of these patients. The most common copathogens were S. pneumoniae, respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus type A. C. pneumoniae pneumonia patients were older and more likely to show congestive heart failure compared to bacteraemic S. pneumoniae patients. The latter had a lower mean diastolic blood pressure, a higher white blood cell count and a lower arterial carbon dioxide tension. Two patients had antibody titres suggestive of recent infection with the feline strain of C. psittaci. Although numerically Chlamydia pneumoniae is an important cause of community-acquired pneumonia, no distinctive clinical features associated with this pathogen were detected in the present study. Feline Chlamydia psittaci may cause a few cases of community-acquired pneumonia. Avian Chlamydia psittaci should be considered only if there is a compatible epidemiological history.
