Theoretic coverage of heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in the prevention of community-acquired pneumonia in children in Italy. In order to evaluate the theoretic coverage of the heptavalent conjugate vaccine against community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) during the first years of life, the anti-capsular IgG antibodies to the nine more common pneumococcal serotypes (1, 4, 5, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, 23F) were quantitated in 196 affected children aged 2-5 years by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays of acute and convalescent serum samples. Acute Streptococcus pneumoniae infection associated with the nine tested serotypes was diagnosed in 57 children (29.1%). Serological data indicated that 16.8% of CAPs were caused by serotypes included in the heptavalent conjugate vaccine. This study confirms the significant role of S. pneumoniae in pediatric CAP, and highlights the importance of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in preventing it during the first years of life.
