The use of chest X-rays for surveillance of bacterial pneumonias in children in Latin America. The Division of Vaccines and Immunization of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) is promoting epidemiological surveillance of bacterial pneumonias in children in Latin America in order to generate scientific evidence to support future decisions concerning using vaccines to control such pneumonias in the countries of the Region of the Americas. The diagnosis of these diseases rarely includes bacteriological documentation of the causative agent. Therefore, studies of this type that are carried out around the world accept radiological images of alveolar consolidation as a confirmatory criterion for a presumptively bacterial pneumonia. This piece examines the theoretical rationale and requirements for using thorax radiology as an instrument for epidemiological surveillance of bacterial pneumonias. The piece also summarizes the activities carried out during 2 years of joint efforts between the Center for Vaccine Development (Centro para Vacunas en Desarrollo) of Chile and PAHO's Division of Vaccines and Immunization. During those 2 years, the two groups encouraged the epidemiological study of bacterial pneumonias in Latin American children, using internationally accepted criteria and definitions as well as tools and practical solutions adapted to the reality of the Region of the America. The activities carried out so far show both the need for and the feasibility of standardizing the interpretation of chest radiographs so that they can be used in epidemiological studies.
