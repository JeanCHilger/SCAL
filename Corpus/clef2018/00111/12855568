Risks and outcomes of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome after nonmyeloablative and conventional conditioning regimens for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) is a significant noninfectious complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We compared the incidences and outcomes of IPS among patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT after nonmyeloablative (n = 183) compared with conventional (n = 917) conditioning between December 1997 and December 2001. Patients given nonmyeloablative conditioning were older than those given conventional conditioning (median ages, 53 vs 41 years P =.001). The cumulative incidence of IPS was significantly lower at 120 days after nonmyeloablative conditioning than conventional conditioning (2.2% vs 8.4%
