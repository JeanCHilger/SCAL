Usefulness of clinical case-definitions in guiding therapy for African children with malaria or pneumonia. The World Health Organisation has developed disease-specific clinical case-definitions to guide management of children with fever or cough, the cardinal signs of malaria and pneumonia. To assess the usefulness of the case-definitions and to investigate their interaction, we studied children with fever or cough brought to a hospital in Lilongwe, Malawi. For all children, a thick blood smear was examined for Plasmodium falciparum parasites. Chest radiography was done only for children with parasitaemia and those who satisfied the clinical case-definition for pneumonia others were assumed to have normal chest radiographs. Of 1599 enrolled children, 566 (35%) had parasitaemia and 116 had radiographic evidence of pneumoniaThe WHO has developed disease-specific clinical case definitions to guide the management of children with fever and cough, the cardinal signs of malaria and pneumonia.
