A clinical study of postoperative infections following open-heart surgery: occurrence and microbiological findings in 782 cases. A total 782 consecutive patients underwent open-heart surgery with CPB between January, 1979 and December, 1988, at the Yamagata University Hospital. We assessed the incidence of postoperative infections in relation to age, the duration of surgery and antibiotic prophylaxis, and examined the causative organisms, after which the types of infecting flora were compared between the 1st period, from 1979 to 1983 and the 2nd period, from 1984 to 1988. Postoperative infection occurred in 104 of the 782 patients (13.3 per cent) in the form of a wound infection in 41 (5.2 per cent), pneumonia in 33 (4.2 per cent), urinary tract infection in 9 (1.2 per cent), prosthetic valve endocarditis in 6 (0.8 per cent), and other infections in 15 (1.9 per cent). Patients aged under 12 months or over 60 years showed a higher incidence of infection, being 17.4 per cent and 19.2 per cent, respectively. Patients who underwent an operation of over 8 hours duration also had a significantly higher incidence compared to those whose operation time was less than 4 hours, being 32.9 per cent and 6.3 per cent, respectively (p less than 0.0001). There was no significant difference in the incidence of postoperative infection between patients given or not given preoperative prophylaxis. A total 123 species of organisms were isolated from the 104 patients, 52.8 per cent being gram-negative bacteria (GNB), and 43.9 per cent gram-positive bacteria (GPB), and a remarkable increase in the incidence of GPB was seen in the 2nd period compared to the 1st period from 31.7 per cent to 50.0 per cent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
