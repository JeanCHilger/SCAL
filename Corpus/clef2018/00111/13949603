Staphylococcal pneumonia and empyema in infants and children. One hundred and seventy-six cases of staphylococcal pneumonia and 35 cases of empyema in infants and children have been studied. There were seven deaths, five in patients with empyema and two in patients without this complication. Early diagnosis on the basis of clinical symptoms and signs and institution of therapy without awaiting radiological or bacteriological confirmation are necessary to prevent development of empyema and to reduce the mortality rate. Chloramphenicol and erythromycin, administered systemically, were generally effective. In severely toxic subjects antitoxin appeared to be of value. Blood transfusion was used to correct the rapidly progressive anemia. A chest radiograph was essential to diagnose empyema. Treatment of this condition by closed intercostal catheter drainage was effective. Pneumatoceles were encountered, but resolved spontaneously. Although there has been no significant decrease in the number of cases of pneumonia encountered, there have been no deaths since 1958 on the treatment outlined.
