Emergence of invasive group A streptococcal disease among young children. Eight cases of invasive group A streptococcal disease in young children were reported over a three-month period, February to April 1990. The spectrum of clinical disease included: pneumonia with bacteremia (two patients), osteomyelitis/septic arthritis (three patients), epiglottitis/supraglottitis (two patients), and sepsis without a focus (one patient). Three cases followed chicken pox. Three children were in shock at the time of presentation, including one child who had a toxic shock-like appearance. Only four children had pharyngitis. Bacteremia was confirmed in three children and presumed in another three. All the subjects survived. Four isolates of group A streptococci were tested for exotoxin A, B, and C (A-0, B-4, C-1) production. These data confirm the reappearance of a highly invasive strain of group A streptococci capable of producing a variety of clinical diseases, including bacteremia and shock, in a significant proportion of victims.
