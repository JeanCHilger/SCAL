Study on the bacteriological examination of sputum and bronchoscopy specimens from 31 cases with pneumonia due to Chlamydia psittaci. We carried out the bacteriological examination of sputum and bronchoscopy specimens from 31 cases with pneumonia due to C. psittaci. The results obtained were as follows: 1. The positive culture of sputum and bronchoscopy specimens were 38.7% (12/31). 2. The organisms detected from them were 13 strains of gram-negative bacilli, 2 of gram-positive cocci and one gram-positive bacillus. 3. Significant differences were observed in the white blood cell count between the cases of positive culture and those of normal upper respiratory tract flora (p less than 0.05). From the results we conclude that it would be better that we add the proper antimicrobial drugs to chlamydial antibiotics in the treatment of patients with leukocytosis.
