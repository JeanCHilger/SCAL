A case of pneumonia due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae accompanying high adenosine deaminase activity in pleural effusion. We experienced a 5-year-old male case of Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia accompanying Adenosine Deaminase (ADA) activity in pleural effusion. Chest roentgenograms revealed the infiltration in the left upper lung field and the left pleural effusion. In serum, the M. pneumoniae CF titer increased to 1:512. The pleural effusion was yellowish in color, with a specific gravity of 1.030, protein 3.7 g/dl, glucose 101 g/dl, and ADA 50 IU/l. Pleural effusion accompanying M. pneumoniae pneumonia is rare, and the high ADA activity in this case has been reported only in one other case. This is a report of a high activity of ADA in the pleural fluid by M. pneumoniae pneumonia.
