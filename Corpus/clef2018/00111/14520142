Linezolid for the treatment of children with bacteremia or nosocomial pneumonia caused by resistant gram-positive bacterial pathogens. Nosocomial infections, particularly hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and bacteremia, are an increasing concern in pediatric hospitals and pediatric intensive care units. Gram-positive pathogens are a leading cause of these infections in children. Linezolid is well-tolerated and as effective as vancomycin in the treatment of these infections in adults.To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of iv/oral linezolid and iv vancomycin in children with resistant Gram-positive HAP or bacteremia.Hospitalized children <12 years of age were randomized 2:1 to linezolid or vancomycin. Patients received linezolid 10 mg/kg iv every 8 h with the option to change treatment to oral linezolid suspension 10 mg/kg every 8 h or iv vancomycin 10 to 15 mg/kg every 6 to 24 h. Clinical response was evaluated at follow-up. Results from an analysis of patients with HAP or bacteremia are presented.Thirty-nine patients (linezolid, 23 vancomycin, 16) with HAP and 113 patients with bacteremia (linezolid, 81Intravenous/oral linezolid was well-tolerated and as effective as vancomycin in treating children with resistant Gram-positive HAP or bacteremia.
