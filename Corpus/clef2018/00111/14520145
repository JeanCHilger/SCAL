Hematologic effects of linezolid in young children. Linezolid is an effective and well-tolerated antibiotic for the treatment of Gram-positive infections, including hospital and community-acquired pneumonia and complicated and uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections. In adults linezolid treatment for >/=2 weeks has been associated with reversible hematopoietic suppression, primarily thrombocytopenia.To evaluate the occurrence of hematologic effects in children with Gram-positive infections in an open label study of linezolid vs. vancomycin.Detailed analyses of hematologic data, including reported hematologic adverse events, complete blood counts, reticulocyte index (RI) and iron studies (serum iron and transferrin saturation), were conducted in both groups at baseline and during and after treatment with the use of an intent-to-treat analysis.Three hundred sixteen patients (median age, 1.65 yr) randomized 2:1 to linezolid (n = 215) or vancomycin (n = 101) were treated. Total treatment durations were similar in the vancomycin group (12.2 +/- 6.4 days median, 11.0 days) and the linezolid group (11.3 +/- 5.0 daysNo significant differences in hematologic profiles between linezolid and vancomycin occurred in this pediatric population.
