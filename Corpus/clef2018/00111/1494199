Sonographic approach to diagnosing pulmonary consolidation. Thirty-nine consecutive patients with consolidated lung confirmed radiologically underwent sonography, and their sonograms were compared with results for 100 healthy subjects. The hyperechoic line of normal aerated lung and its air artifacts showed respiratory motions ("gliding sign," n = 100). Patients with pneumonia demonstrated distinct sonographic patterns. Strong linear echoes with characteristic air artifacts (air bronchogram) and anechoic tubular structures (fluid bronchogram) were visualized in 36 of 39 patients (92.30%). The superficial lung showed a homogeneous hypoechoic band termed "superficial fluid alveolograms" (n = 39) with respiratory motions in 35 of 39 patients. We conclude that sonography can evaluate pulmonary consolidation and may provide additional roentgenographic information, especially when fluid bronchograms are visualized.
