Investigation of atypical bacteria and virus antigens in respiratory tract infections by use of an immunofluorescence method. In this study an immunofluorescence (IF) method was used to investigate the antigens of viruses and atypical bacteria in respiratory tract infections (RTI) in pediatric and adult age groups. In this prospective study of 2 years (1998-2000), IF was used to investigate the antigens of 7 viral and 3 atypical bacteria to be used for the etiological diagnosis of RTI. Sputum (33.6%) and nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens were obtained from pediatric patients (Group I, 76 cases) and adults (Group II, 135 cases) with RTI symptoms. Antigen detection rates were found to be 44.7% in Group I and 67.4% in Group II (P < 0.05). The following rates for specific antigens in Groups I and II, respectively, were as follows: Chlamydia pneumoniae, 17.1 and 13.3% (P > 0.05) Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 0 and 9.6% (P < 0.05)
