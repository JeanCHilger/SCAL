Mycoplasma pneumoniae and asthma in children. The aim of this prospective study of a population of children (age, 2-15 years) hospitalized for severe asthma was to test them for acute infection due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae and acute infection due to Chlamydia pneumoniae. Of 119 patients with previously diagnosed asthma, acute M. pneumoniae infection was found in 24 (20%) and C. pneumoniae infection was found in 4 (3.4%) of the patients during the current exacerbation. Of 51 patients experiencing their first asthma attack, acute M. pneumoniae infection was proven in 26 (50%) of the patients (P<.01) and C. pneumoniae in 4 (8.3%). In the control group of 152 children with stable asthma or rhinitis, 8 (5.2%) had M. pneumoniae infection (P<.005). Of the 29 patients experiencing their first asthma attack and infected with M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae, 18 (62%) had asthma recurrences but only 6 (27%) of the 22 patients who did not have such infections had asthma recurrences (P<.05). M. pneumoniae may play a role in the onset of asthma in predisposed children and could be a trigger for recurrent wheezing.
