Once-daily oral gatifloxacin vs three-times-daily co-amoxiclav in the treatment of patients with community-acquired pneumonia. A double-blind, double-dummy, multicentre, multinational, parallel-group study was designed to establish proof of equivalence between oral gatifloxacin and oral co-amoxiclav in the treatment of 462 patients with mild-to-moderate community-acquired pneumonia. Eligible patients were randomised equally to either gatifloxacin 400 mg once-daily plus matching placebo for 5-10 days, or amoxycillin 500 mg + clavulanic acid 125 mg three-times-daily for 5-10 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was clinical response (clinical cure plus improvement) at the end of treatment. Overall, a successful clinical response was achieved in 86.8% of gatifloxacin-treated patients, compared with 81.6% of those receiving co-amoxiclav, while corresponding rates of bacteriological efficacy (eradication plus presumed eradication) were 83.1% and 78.7%, respectively. The safety and tolerability profile of gatifloxacin was comparable to that of co-amoxiclav, with adverse gastrointestinal events, e.g., diarrhoea and nausea, being the most common treatment-related adverse events in both groups. The study showed no evidence of gatifloxacin-induced phototoxicity, musculoskeletal disorders, or hepatic and renal problems. Overall, this study showed that gatifloxacin was equivalent clinically to a standard course of co-amoxiclav in patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and that gatifloxacin was safe and well-tolerated.
