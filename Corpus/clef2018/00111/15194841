Necrotizing pneumonitis caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae in pediatric patients: report of five cases and review of literature. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection is usually self-limited without severe sequelae. We report 5 pediatric patients with necrotizing pneumonitis caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae and reviewed the reported cases in the English language. Protracted course of fever and respiratory distress were noted in all 5 patients. Macrolides and adequate chest tube drainage for pleural effusion were the mainstay of treatment.
