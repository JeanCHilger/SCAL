Expansile pneumonia in children caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis: clinical, radiological, and bronchoscopic appearances. A cohort of 24 children with expansile pneumonia caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis is described in mostly HIV-noninfected children (n = 22). The children presented with nonresolving pneumonia and a swinging fever (83%). On chest radiography, they had dense opacification with bulging fissures mainly in the upper lobes (75%). On computed tomography, the lobes are consolidated, with areas of liquefacation. Other features visible are enlarged mediastinal lymph adenopathy with ring enhancement (100%), cavities (63%), and tracheal compression (71%). On bronchoscopy, bronchi were obstructed by more than 75% in 20 (83%) of cases. Lymph gland enucleation was required in 42% of cases. Phrenic nerve palsy was present in 3 children, of whom 2 underwent diaphragmatic plication. The children received standard antituberculous therapy, to which prednisone (2 mg/kg/day) was added for 1 month. The mortality was 4% after 6 months of therapy.
