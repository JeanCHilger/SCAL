Human metapneumovirus pneumonia in an adult patient hospitalized for suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a newly identified virus responsible for occasionally severe respiratory infections, mainly observed in children.A 59-year old man was hospitalised for respiratory problems and fever 3 days after his return from China during the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Other than fever (>38 degrees C), the patient exhibited a dry cough, myalgias, arthralgias and mild lymphopenia and the chest radiography showed an opacity on the right lower lung. Conventional virological investigations remained negative. Detection of the novel SARS-associated coronavirus was negative but hMPV detection was positive.The present observation indicates that hMPV may cause respiratory symptoms mimicking initial manifestations of SARS in adults visiting epidemic countries.hMPV testing has clinical utility in adult patients with acute respiratory tract infection.
