Varicella zoster in Guinea-Bissau: intensity of exposure and severity of infection. To describe the epidemiology of and risk factors for severe chickenpox in Guinea- Bissau.A prospective household study in a semiurban area of the capital. Severity was assessed by number of pox, fever response and presence of pneumonia. Severity was compared for the first case in a house, that is, the index case, and the secondary cases infected at home.We identified 1539 cases of chickenpox. The median age was lower for boys and secondary cases (both P < 0.03) 44.6% of children were 1-4 years of age. The likely minimum interval between index and secondary cases was 10 daysAge and intensity of exposure are important determinants for severity of chickenpox infection. The length of the incubation period depends on intensity of exposure, suggesting that the dose of infection might be important.
