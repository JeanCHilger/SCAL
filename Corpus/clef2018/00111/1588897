Lactate dehydrogenase and its isoenzymes in respiratory diseases in children. Total Lactate Dehydrogenase (LD, EC 1.1.1.27) activity in serum and LD isoenzymes were quantified in 161 children (51 with pneumonia at the time of diagnosis, 60 hospitalized for asthma in acute period and 50 healthy subjects) to ascertain the relationship of these markers with injury of lung tissue. No statistical variations, between different groups in total activity, were found. Significantly decreased proportions of LD1 (p less than 0.000001) and of LD2 (p less than 0.000001) with simultaneous increase of LD4 (p less than 0.000001) and LD5 (p less than 0.000001) resulted in children with pneumonia, as to asthmatic or healthy subjects. Investigators conclude that LD should be determined in every patient with pneumonia because of the presence of a specific LD isoenzyme pattern.
