Recent challenges in the management of congenital tracheal stenosis: an individualized approach. Congenital tracheal stenosis (CTS) may present as a life-threatening condition often requiring urgent surgical correction. We report our recent experience of 13 consecutive patients with CTS over the past 18 months.Retrospective analysis of all patients with CTS admitted to our institution from January 2003 to June 2004.Five of 13 patients (6 boys and 7 girls) were premature at birth. Mean age at repair was 3.8 months (range, 7 days to 9 months). Ten presented with cardiac arrests or "near-death" spells, 4 with copresenting pulmonary infection. Nine patients were local and 4 were national. Surgical repairs included slide tracheoplasty (n = 5), cartilage patch tracheoplasty (n = 4), patch-and-slide tracheoplasty (n = 1), and balloon dilatation (n = 1). Preoperative computed tomographic imaging invariably underestimated the severity of pathology. Two patients with minimal symptoms were treated nonoperatively. Two patients required additional endobronchial stents for bronchomalacia. Cardiopulmonary bypass was used in 8 patients. There were 3 deaths, including 2 planned withdrawal of treatment. Two patients remained in hospital. The remaining patients were discharged from our hospital.Presentation of CTS can be precipitated by respiratory infection. Preoperative imaging often underestimates the caliber and length of pathology. The treatment options for patients with CTS including observation should be individualized.
