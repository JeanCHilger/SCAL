Significance of atypical pathogens among community-acquired pneumonia adult patients admitted to hospital in Kuwait. The aim of this study is to determine the microbial etiology and severity of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in Kuwait.The severity of consecutive adult CAP cases admitted to 3 hospitals over a 1-year period was classified according to the Pneumonia Outcome Research Team (PORT) severity index. The microbial etiology was determined using standard methods for bacteria and serological tests for atypical and viral pathogens.The study population was 124 of the 135 admissions 63 female, 61 maleOur study shows that a large percentage of mild CAP cases are admitted to hospitals in Kuwait. Atypical pathogens have a significant role in the etiology of CAP. There is overtreatment of CAP with a combination treatment consisting mainly of third-generation chephalosporins and macrolides.
