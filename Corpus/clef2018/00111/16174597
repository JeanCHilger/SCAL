Therapeutic effects of cefepime and sulbactam/cefoperazone on moderate and severe respiratory tract infection in children. To evaluate the therapeutic effects and safety of cefepime (Maxipime) and sulbactam/cefoperazone (sulperazone) on moderate and severe respiratory infection in children.Totally 100 children hospitalized for pneumonia were randomized equally into 2 groups, namely group A with maxipime treatment at the dose of 50 mg/kg given intravenously twice daily, and group B with sulperazone treatment at 50-100 mg/kg given intravenously twice a day. The therapeutic effects and safety of both medications were observed.In maxipime group, 44 of the 50 cases were cured with complete elimination of the symptoms and signs, and obvious therapeutic effect was achieved in 5 cases with significant improvement or resolution of the majority of symptoms and signs. One case failed to respond favorably to the treatment, with the overall efficacy rate of 98% without incidence of adverse effects. In sulperazone group, 40 of the 50 cases were cured, 6 showed significant improvement, and 4 failed to respond to the treatment, with the rate of 92%. One patient complained of rashes during sulperazone treatment, which disappeared the next day without sulperazone withdrawal. Significant difference was not noted between the groups (chi(2)=2.43, P>0.05).Both maxipime and sulperazon are effective and safe for application in children with moderate and severe respiratory infections.
