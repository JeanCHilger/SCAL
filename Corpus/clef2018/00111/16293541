Asthma attack associated with oxidative stress by exposure to ETS and PAH. Asthma is primarily an airways inflammatory disease, and the bronchial airways have been shown to be particularly susceptible to oxidant-induced tissue damage.The purpose of this study was to investigate whether pulmonary inflammation in asthma is associated with exposure to environmental oxidants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS).We assessed the exposure level of PAH and ETS by using urinary 1-hydroxypyrene glucuronide (1-OHPG) and cotinine. We estimated oxidative damage and inflammatory cytokine levels from 16 asthma patients and 16 patients in stable conditions 1 to 2 months later.Our study showed that the levels of oxidative damage, as measured by malondialdehyde (MDA), were significantly increased (p = 0.006) during the asthma attacks. Proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines were both increased during the asthma attacks compared to the stable conditions at follow-up. Interleukin (IL-6) and IL-10 were especially increased significantly (p = 0.015 and p < 0.001, respectively). Correlations were observed between inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-1beta (p = 0.034).This study supports the results of in vitro studies that oxidative stress, specifically lipid peroxidation, contributes to the pathophysiology of asthma. Therefore, environmental interventions based on this better understanding are needed to significantly reduce oxidant stress and prevent or minimize the development of asthmatic symptoms.
