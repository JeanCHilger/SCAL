IFN-gamma in non atopic children with recurrent obstructive bronchitis. Recurrent respiratory infection cause an imbalance of Th1/Th2 immune response with decreased level of IFN-gamma. Result of several studies have provided evidence linking Mycoplasma infection with recurrent wheezing in atopic children. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of Mycoplasma infection on IFN-gamma level in non-atopic children with recurrent obstructive bronchitis. Serum IFN-gamma was measured in two groups: the study group included 30 non-atopic children 1-4 years of age with recurrent obstructive bronchitis caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae, the control group included 15 children with the same disease with negative Mycoplasma pneumoniae result. There were no differences in age, sex and family history of atopy. This result shows reduced Th 1 immune response that causes reduced antiviral activity and high morbidity in non-atopic wheezy children.
