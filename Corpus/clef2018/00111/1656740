Multicenter evaluation of azithromycin and cefaclor in acute lower respiratory tract infections. This was a randomized, third-party-blinded, multicenter study that compared once-daily azithromycin (500 mg on day 1, followed by 250 mg on days 2-5) to cefaclor (500 mg three times daily for 10 days) in the treatment of patients with acute bronchitis or pneumonia. A total of 546 patients were entered into the study and 272 patients were evaluable for efficacy analysis. Of these, 249 (176 azithromycin, 73 cefaclor) had bronchitis and 23 (15 azithromycin, 8 cefaclor) had pneumonia. The combined clinical cure and improvement rate, as determined by the investigator, was 96% for azithromycin and 94% for cefaclor, with 88% bacteriologic eradication in both treatment groups. The elimination of Haemophilus influenzae was significantly better with azithromycin (94.5%) than with cefaclor (61.1%) (p less than 0.001 Fisher's exact two-tail test). The two antibiotics were well tolerated during this study
