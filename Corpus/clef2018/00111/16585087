Mixed community-acquired pneumonia in hospitalised patients. The role of mixed community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is controversial. The aim of the present study was to determine the incidence, principal microbial patterns, clinical predictors and course of mixed CAP. The current study included 1,511 consecutive hospitalised patients with CAP. Of these, 610 (40%) patients had an established aetiology. One pathogen was demonstrated in 528 patients and 82 (13%) patients had mixed pneumonia. Cases including CAP, by a pyogenic bacteria and a complete paired serology for "atypicals", revealed that 82 (13%) patients had definite single pyogenic pneumonia and 28 patients (5%) had mixed pyogenic pneumonia. In patients with mixed CAP, Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most prevalent microorganism (44 out of 82 54%). The most frequent combination was S. pneumoniae with Haemophilus influenzae (17 out of 82
