Effect of regular intravenous immunoglobulin therapy on prevention of pneumonia in patients with common variable immunodeficiency. Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is a primary immunodeficiency disorder, which presents with hypogammaglobulinemia and recurrent bacterial infections. Patients with CVID have frequent and severe episodes of pneumonia. The standard intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) therapy has led to the reduction of pulmonary infections in these patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of IVIG treatment in reducing the incidence of pneumonia in patients with CVID.Twenty six Iranian patients with CVID whose diseases had been diagnosed at the Children Medical Center and had received regular IVIG for at least 9 months were selected. The numbers of episodes of pneumonia and hospital admissions were documented before and during treatment with IVIG.Of 26 patients with CVID, 80.5% had experienced pneumonia at least once before receiving immunoglobulin and 88.5% required hospital admission. After starting treatment with IVIG (mean treatment period, 41.5 +/- 35.4 months), the annual incidence of pneumonia significantly decreased from 80.5% to 34.6% (p=0.0017), and the rate of hospitalization from 88.5% to 46% (p=0.0025) . The incidence of pneumonia requiring treatment or hospitalization fell from 3.4 to 0.7 per year (p<0.0005).Regular IVIG therapy can significantly reduce the incidence of pneumonia and hospital admission due to infections in patients with CVID.
