The relationship between serum endothelin (ET)-1 and wheezing status in the children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia. Although Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection is known to be associated with acute wheezing and the exacerbation of asthma, the mechanism by which this pathogen contributes to the development of wheeze-related symptoms is not fully understood. The aim of our study was to examine serum endothelin (ET)-1 and other cytokines in acute M. pneumoniae pneumonia and investigate if there is any relation between these inflammatory mediators and the occurrence of wheezing. We studied 53 patients, aged 3-13 yr, who admitted with pneumonia. These patients were divided into three groups: M. pneumoniae pneumonia with wheeze (n=23) and without wheeze (n=19), and the patients without the evidence of M. pneumoniae infection (n=11). Age-matched controls (n=10) were also studied. The serum concentrations of ET-1, interleukin (IL)-5 and IL-18 were measured using ELISA kits in patient groups and controls. The patients with M. pneumoniae pneumonia had significantly higher serum ET-1 than those without evidence of M. pneumoniae infection. In the presence of M. pneumoniae pneumonia, ET-1 concentrations were significantly higher in the patients with wheeze than those without wheeze. IL-5 and IL-18 in each patient group were higher compared to controls. However, no significant between-group difference was observed. Total serum IgE levels were significantly higher in the patients with M. pneumoniae pneumonia and wheeze than in those without wheeze. A positive correlation was observed between serum ET-1 and total IgE in the patients with M. pneumoniae pneumonia and wheeze. Our results may suggest a role of ET-1 in the occurrence of acute wheezing or exacerbation of asthma associated with M. pneumoniae pneumonia.
