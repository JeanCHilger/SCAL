Mycoplasma pneumoniae detection with PCR in renal tissue of a patient with acute glomerulonephritis. Renal disease concurrent with a Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection is uncommon. In this report we describe the clinical outcome of a 6-year-old patient who presented with a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis that required dialysis. A kidney biopsy was performed, and the results revealed membranoprolipherative glomerulonephritis. The IgM serology was positive, and M. pneumoniae DNA was detected in a renal biopsy sample using a nested-PCR assay. The outcome was good.
