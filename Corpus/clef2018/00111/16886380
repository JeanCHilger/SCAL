Own clinical observations of toxocara infections. Toxocarosis clinical forms wers diagnosed according to Kraus et. al. (1995). There were three forms: 1) asymptomatic - marked by hypereosynophilia and ELISA positive serologic reaction, 2) minor - with cutaneous, pulmomary and pseudorheumatic lesions, 3) major - with hepatosplenomegaly and multifocal inflammatory lesions of organ of sight. Over the years of 1994-1997 in Infectious, Parasitic and Tropical Diseases clinic of the Voivodship Specialist Hospital of Lódź we found and treated 137 Toxocara canis cases. Among them 63 (46:0%) asymptomatic, 57 (42.6%) minor and 17 (12.4%) major forms were diagnosed. The disease was detected in 80 (58.4%) adults and 57 (41.6%) children. Seventy six patients lived in towns and 61 in country. Minor form patients had the symptoms as follows: skin allergy, large joints lesions, augmentation in lymph nodes. Radiology examinations revealed pulmonary lesions. Using ultrasonography there was found hepatosplenomegaly and changes echogenity in patients with major form. Biochemical tests showed elevation in hepatic enzymes activity. Lesions of organ of sight were multifocal and usually included uveitis, retinitis, inflammation of anterior chamber and inflammation of vitreous body.
