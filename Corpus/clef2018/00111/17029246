Pulmonary dysfunction in pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients: overview, diagnostic considerations, and infectious complications. Pulmonary complications are among the most common and serious sequelae seen in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients. This two-part review addresses the incidence and impact of pulmonary complications in pediatric HSCT patients. In this first part we review the available data for the use of diagnostic modalities in this population, including flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and open lung biopsy (OLB). We also review the many infectious pulmonary complications that may occur in pediatric HSCT recipients, utilizing the traditional chronologic divisions of neutropenic phase (0-30 days following HSCT), early phase (30-100 days), and late phase (>100 days).
