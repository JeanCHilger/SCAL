The determination of free and bound oxyproline in urine. A method of measuring urinary free, peptide- and protein-bound hydroxyproline is suggested. Adults were found to excrete 18 mumol of free, 155 mumol of peptide-bound, and 8 mumol of protein-bound hydroxyproline daily. In children daily urinary levels of free and peptide-bound hydroxyproline were higher. Data are presented on changes in various hydroxyproline forms in pneumonia, rheumatic fever, and hemorrhagic fever with the renal syndrome.
