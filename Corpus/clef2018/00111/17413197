Chlamydia sp. in hospitalised children with community acquired pneumonia. Our aim was to document the prevalence of chlamydial infection in children less than five years of age with Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP). Seventy three children, 1 month to 5 years of age, hospitalized with CAP were enrolled over a period of one year. Microimmunofluorescence (MIF) was done to detect IgM antibodies against Chlamydia sp. in sera of all patients PCR was performed to detect C. pneumoniae DNA in nasopharyngeal aspirates. The prevalence of Chlamydia species infection in CAP in children < 5 years of age was 5.5% (4/73). Two cases were positive for C. trachomatis antibodies
