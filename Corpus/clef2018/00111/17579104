Parapneumonic effusion and empyema in children: retrospective review of the duPont experience. Management of pediatric parapneumonic effusions and empyema remains controversial. Treatment includes antibiotics, chest tube, fibrinolytic therapy, video-assisted thoracoscopy and debridement, and open thoracotomy and decortication. A retrospective 10-year study was done to identify patient selection variables for specific therapies. Charts (n = 101) with diagnoses of empyema without comorbidity were reviewed, a database was developed, and variables between patients who did and did not receive thoracoscopic debridement were compared at admission and during hospitalization. The difference in positive culture reports with video-assisted thoracoscopy compared with medical management was significant (P < .018). Postsurgical patients used the intensive care unit and had 2 or more chest tubes with greater frequency than medically managed patients (P < .014, P < .002). Antibiotics, video-assisted thoracoscopy, and chest tube within 48 hours of admission shortened hospitalization by 4 days (P < .001) compared with delayed video-assisted thoracoscopy done after 48 hours of admission.
