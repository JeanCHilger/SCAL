Chlamydia pneumoniae respiratory infections in Taiwan. To understand the epidemiology of Chlamydia pneumoniae acute infections in Taiwan, we collected 116 paired and 244 single sera from patients suspected of C. pneumoniae infection and conducted microimmunofluorescence test. Eighty-three patients (83/360, 23%) met the diagnostic criteria of current C. pneumoniae infection. The C. pneumoniae infections were significantly higher in men than in women (P< or =0.0001) and were most frequent in the group of 40-49 year-olds, and the people older than 70 years old. C. pneumoniae infection often occurred in the late autumn lasting to the cold winter and in the transition period between the spring and summer.
