Community-acquired pneumonia: a review and recent advances. In the beginning of this 21st century, community-acquired pneumonias (CAP) are still responsible for a significant number of deaths among young children in many developing countries. Public health initiatives such as those proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the management of CAP by means of identifying highly predictable signs and symptoms have had great positive impact in some communities. Still, this approach induces an overdiagnosis and overtreatment of CAP in children below the age of 5 years due to the misclassification of pneumonia in children with fast breathing associated with viral bronchiolitis. Even among children of developed countries, CAP is an important public health problem and many aspects of current diagnostic and management measures are discussed here. In this article, we review the epidemiology and basic concepts of CAP and update current information on clinical evaluation and management of the disease.
