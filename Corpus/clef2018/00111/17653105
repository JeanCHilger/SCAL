Toxicity of fiber- and penton base-modified adenovirus type 5 vectors on lung development in newborn rats. Transient overexpression of genes involved in lung regulation might prevent alveolar developmental disorders (ADDs) in premature neonates. However, adenovirus 5 (Ad5) vectors per se, and not isolated capsid proteins, induce ADDs after tracheal administration to newborn rats. To test the hypothesis that Ad5 capsid components are mainly responsible for ADDs, we evaluated newborn rats' lung development by morphometry after tracheal administration of a panel of Ad5 vectors with mutations in the fiber or penton base. Three distinct patterns of lung response were observed on postnatal day (PD) 21: (i) emphysematous-like lesions, common to Ad5 overexposing RGD motifs (ii) altered septation, representative of the wild-type capsid Ad5 lesion
