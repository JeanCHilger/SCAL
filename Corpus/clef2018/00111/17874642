Chemical pneumonia following ingestion of lamp oil. A 20-months-old girl developed a cough and became drowsy after drinking lamp oil. In the Emergency Ward, her oxygen saturation was 85%. The day after admission to hospital she showed a clinical and radiological picture of chemical pneumonia. After 3 days the patient could be discharged in good condition. The most important symptoms after the ingestion of hydrocarbon compounds such as lamp oil are respiratory problems due to aspiration and effects on the central nervous system following gastrointestinal absorption. Severe symptoms can develop in a short period of time. The treatment is supportive. The prognosis is favourable.
