Thinking and methods concerning applying data-mining technique in clinical efficacy evaluation of TCM treatment for child's pneumonia. TCM syndrome differentiation system (TCM-SDS) possesses a complex nonlinear characteristic, which determines the falt that the evaluation of TCM efficacy should not be simplified to a causal or linear relationship. Previous selected indexes and methods for evaluating curative effect of Child's pneumonia have their limitations. This paper mainly introduces several thoughts and methods formed in the exploratory researches, employing data mining technology in this field. We believe that efficacy evaluation research of Child's pneumonia on the basis of standardized study of TCM-SDS is a scientific work. Applying data mining method in processing enormous and multilayer information of TCM differentiation has strong advantages in screening evaluating indexes of Child's pneumonia. Meanwhile, some major concerning technical categorizations and implementing strategies for the research are also introduced.
