Seroprevalence of Mycobacterium pneumoniae in healthy adolescents in Taiwan. This study was designed to understand the seroprevalence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in healthy Taiwanese adolescents. The study included 2,233 college freshmen (female:male = 1.29:1 mean age, 19.7 years). The percentages of subjects residing in northern, central, southern, and eastern Taiwan were 66.91, 15.89, 9.0, and 8.2%, respectively. All enrolled subjects underwent a serologic agglutination test to detect serum concentrations of antibodies to M. pneumoniae. The test results showed that 19.84% of the subjects were infected and, of those, 6.0% were estimated to have subsequently acquired a current or acute infection during this study period. Moreover, the percentage of seropositive females (22.77%) was significantly higher than that of seropositive males (16.07%) (odds ratio, 1.54
