Emergency decompressive craniectomy for fulminating infectious encephalitis. In patients who develop fulminant cerebral edema and elevated intracranial pressures, viral encephalitis can result in devastating neurological and cognitive sequelae despite antiviral therapy. The benefits of decompressive craniectomy, if any, in this group of patients are unclear. In this manuscript, the authors report their experience with 2 patients who presented with herpes simplex virus requiring surgical decompression resulting in excellent neurocognitive outcomes. They also review the literature on decompressive craniectomy in patients with fulminating infectious encephalitis. Four published articles consisting of 13 patients were identified in which the authors had reported their experience with decompressive craniectomy for fulminant infectious encephalitis. Herpes simplex virus was confirmed in 6 cases, Mycoplasma pneumoniae in 2, and an unidentified viral infection in 5 others. All patients developed clinical signs of brainstem dysfunction and underwent surgical decompression resulting in good (Glasgow Outcome Scale [GOS] Score 4) or excellent (GOS Score 5) functional recoveries. The authors conclude that infectious encephalitis is a neurosurgical disease in cases in which there is clinical and imaging evidence of brainstem compression. Surgical decompression results in excellent recovery of functional independence in both children and adults despite early clinical signs of brainstem dysfunction.
