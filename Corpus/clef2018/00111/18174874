The utility of serum C-reactive protein in differentiating bacterial from nonbacterial pneumonia in children: a meta-analysis of 1230 children. Differentiating bacterial from nonbacterial community-acquired pneumonia in children is difficult. Although several studies have evaluated serum concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) as a predictor of bacterial pneumonia in this patient population, the utility of this test remains unclear.The purpose of this meta-analysis was to quantitatively define the utility of serum CRP as a predictor of bacterial pneumonia in acutely ill children.Multiple databases were searched, bibliographies reviewed, and 2 authorities in the field were queried. Studies were included if: (1) the patient population was between 1 month and 18 years of age (2) CRP was quantified in all subjects as part of the initial evaluation of a suspected, infectious, pulmonary processEight studies fulfilled inclusion criteria. Combining all of the studies demonstrated a pooled study population of 1230 patients with the incidence of bacterial infection of 41%. Children with bacterial pneumonia were significantly more likely to have serum CRP concentrations exceeding 35-60 mg/L than children with nonbacterial infections (odds ratio = 2.58, 95% confidence interval = 1.20-5.55). Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that this difference was robust. There was significant heterogeneity among the 8 studies (Q = 37.7, P < 0.001, I2 = 81.4) that remained throughout the sensitivity analysis.In children with pneumonia, serum CRP concentrations exceeding 40-60 mg/L weakly predict a bacterial etiology.
