Oseltamivir and influenza-related complications, hospitalization and healthcare expenditure in healthy adults and children. To assess influenza-related secondary complications and healthcare use and costs in patients prescribed oseltamivir for influenza.This study examined health insurance claims data for patients diagnosed with influenza during five influenza seasons. Patients prescribed oseltamivir were propensity matched with patients not prescribed antiviral therapy.Clinical outcomes were diagnosis with pneumonia, otitis media and hospitalizations, along with in-patient, out-patient and pharmacy use and costs.Each group included 45,751 patients. Patients prescribed oseltamivir had significant reductions in the risks of pneumonia (odds ratio [OR]: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.80, 1.00), otitis media (OR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.77, 0.91) and hospitalization (OR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.62, 0.83). The risks of pneumonia and otitis media were also lower in children and adolescents (< or = 17 years) prescribed oseltamivir (OR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.60, 0.91 and OR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.69, 0.85, respectively). Total healthcare costs were lower for patients prescribed oseltamivir versus no antiviral therapy (mean US$500 versus 510 p < 0.0001). Patients prescribed oseltamivir had fewer claims per patient for antibiotics (0.37 versus 0.45The risks of influenza-related complications and hospitalization, as well as healthcare use and costs, were lower for patients prescribed oseltamivir than for those with no antiviral prescription.
