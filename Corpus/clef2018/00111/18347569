Prognostic value of serum surfactant protein D level prior to transplant for the development of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome and idiopathic pneumonia syndrome following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) and idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) cause high mortality and impaired survival after allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Early recognition of patients at high risk of developing BOS/IPS may lead to improving the outcome of allo-HSCT. We retrospectively analyzed serum surfactant protein A, D (SP-A, -D) and Kerbs von Lungren 6 Ag (KL-6) levels before allo-HSCT in 56 patients who survived more than 90 days after allo-HSCT and compared values of these serum markers and other transplant factors in BOS/IPS patients with those in non-BOS/IPS patients. Five patients developed BOS and two developed IPS at a median interval of 303 and 117 days (range, 100-452 and 95-153) from transplantation. As a result of univariate analysis, pretransplant serum SP-D levels but not SP-A, KL-6 in BOS/IPS patients were significantly lower than those in non-BOS/IPS patients (P=0.03). In multivariate analysis, the patients with lower pretransplant serum SP-D level had a trend toward frequent development of BOS/IPS (P=0.08). Constitutive serum SP-D level before allo-HSCT may be a useful, noninvasive predictor for the development of BOS/IPS.
