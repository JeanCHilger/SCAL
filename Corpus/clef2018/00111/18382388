Human metapneumovirus infection in young children hospitalized with acute respiratory tract disease: virologic and clinical features. Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is an emerging virus associated with acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) in young children.To evaluate virologic and clinical features of hMPV infection during 2 consecutive winter-spring seasons.Nasal washes were obtained from children younger than 5 years of age hospitalized for ARI. Specimens were tested for hMPV by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The hMPV F gene amplification products were sequenced, and phylogenetic trees were constructed.A high incidence of hMPV infection (25.3%) was observed during the 2005-2006 winter-spring season, whereas a much lower rate of infection (4.7%) during the following season was found. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that, during the 2 seasons, 60.4% of the hMPV detected were A2a, 22.9% were A2b, 4.2% were B1, and 12.5% were B2. hMPV A1 strains were not detected in any tested specimen. Clinical diagnosis was bronchiolitis in 57.1% pneumonia in 25%These results provide further evidence of the importance of hMPV as a pathogen associated with ARI in young children. Involvement of hMPV/RSV coinfection in cases of pneumonia is suspected.
