Clinically concealing manifestations of type B dissecting aortic aneurysms. Newly onset type B dissecting aortic aneurysms are clinically manifested by a variety of diseases in 31.9% of patients. Amongst the most frequently occurring events encountered are coronary and gastrointestinal masks. The main symptoms of aortic dissecting aneurysms include pain (78.7%), arterial hypertension (87.2%), and tachycardia (46.2%). Polymorphism of the clinical pattern of dissecting aortic aneurysms is fraught with a delay in making the accurate diagnosis, unreasonable surgical interventions to be performed at non-specialized departments, and, ultimately, ill-timed referral to and performance of appropriate angioplasty.
