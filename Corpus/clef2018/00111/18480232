Rapid and simple diagnosis of Chlamydophila pneumoniae pneumonia by an immunochromatographic test for detection of immunoglobulin M antibodies. To evaluate a newly developed immunochromatographic test (the MySet test) for the detection of Chlamydophila pneumoniae-specific immunoglobulin M antibodies, the results obtained by the MySet test were compared with those obtained by two serological tests. The sensitivity and specificity of the MySet test were 100% and 92.9%, respectively. The MySet test is rapid and simple to use and is thought to be a useful tool for the selection of appropriate antibiotic therapy.
