Serum levels of fatty acid-binding protein and brain natriuretic peptide in children with pneumonia complicated by acute congestive heart failure. To assess the values of serum fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in pneumonia complicated by acute congestive heart failure (CHF) in children.Serum levels of FABP and BNP were determined using ELISA in 36 children with pneumonia complicated by CHF (pneumonia group) and 28 healthy children (control group).Serum levels of FABP and BNP in the pneumonia group at the acute stage were significantly higher than those in the control group and those at the recovery stage (P<0.01). Compared with the control group, serum levels of FABP and BNP in the pneumonia group at the recovery stage increased significantly (P<0.01). At the acute stage, 35 patients (97.2%) showed increased serum FABP level but 28 (77.8%) showed increased serum BNP level (P<0.05) in the pneumonia group. At the recovery stage, the incidence of abnormal serum FABP (72.2%) was significantly higher than that of BNP (44.4%) in the pneumonia group (P<0.05).Serum levels of FABP and BNP can be regarded as biochemical markers of myocardial damage in children with pneumonia complicated by CHF and serum FABP appears to be a more sensitive one. Serum FABP and BNP remained at higher levels through the recovery stage, suggesting that myocardial damage existed though the clinical symptoms were improved at the stage.
