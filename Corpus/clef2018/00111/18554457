Early surgical treatment for infants with large atrial septal defects or ventricular septal defects complicated by pneumonia: experience of 39 cases. This research reported the experience of early surgical treatment for infants with large atrial septal defects (ASD) or ventricular septal defects (VSD) complicated by pneumonia.Between January 2003 and January 2008, 39 infants with large ASD or VSD complicated by pneumonia were admitted to the Second Xiangya Hospital. Thirty-six patients underwent surgical repair within 7-10 days after pneumonia had been controlled. Mean age was 5.4+/-3.4 months and mean weight was 4.7+/-1.6 kg in the 36 patients. Three patients received conservative treatment due to uncontrolled lung infections.Of the 36 patients, 33 had successful surgery and 3 (8.3%) died of serious low cardiac output (n=1) or respiratory failure due to congenital tracheostenosis (n=2). The 33 survivors showed normal growth and development in a 6 month-5 year follow-up. Of the 3 patients receiving conservative treatment, 1 died of cardiopulmonary failure and 2 were discharged after the symptoms had been improved.With increasing medical experience and technique, early surgical operation may be performed with good outcomes in infants with large ASD or VSD complicated by pneumonia.
