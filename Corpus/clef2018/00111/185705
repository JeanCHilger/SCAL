Infectious complications observed during the use of antimitotic agents in hematology. During acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children, bacterial infections occur during initial treatment, whereas virus infections are observed during remission. Mycoses and pneumocystis carinii infections are the commonest late complications. During agranulocytosis, any prolonged fever should be considered as due to infection and probably septicemia. The bacteria are usually of digestive origin. Antibiotic therapy is only very inconstantly efficacious, and the course follows closely the number of granular cells, thus justifying the use of white cell transfusions.
