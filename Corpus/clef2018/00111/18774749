X-linked chronic granulomatous disease secondary to skewed X chromosome inactivation in a female with a novel CYBB mutation and late presentation. Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is characterized by defects in the superoxide producing enzyme NADPH oxidase causing phagocytes to improperly clear invading pathogens. Here we report findings of a late presenting 16-year-old female with X-linked CGD. The patient presented with community-acquired pneumonia, but symptoms persisted for 2 weeks during triple antimicrobial coverage. Cultures revealed Aspergillus fumigatus which was resolved through aggressive voriconazole treatment. Neutrophil studies revealed NADPH oxidase activity and flavocytochrome b(558) levels that were 4-8% of controls and suggested carrier status of the mother. We found a null mutation in the CYBB gene (c.252insAG) predicting an aberrant gp91(phox) protein (p.Cys85fsX23) in the heterozygous state. Methylation analysis demonstrated extremely skewed X chromosome inactivation favoring the maternally inherited defective gene. In conclusion, a novel mutation in the CYBB gene and an extremely skewed X-inactivation event resulted in the rare expression of the CGD phenotype in a carrier female.
