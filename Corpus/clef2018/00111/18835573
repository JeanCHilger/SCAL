Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in a pediatric population: analysis of soluble immune markers as risk factors for asthma. Epidemiologic and clinical evidence suggests that respiratory tract infection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae maybe implicated in the initiation and exacerbation of asthma. This study examines the incidence and frequency of M. pneumoniae infection in children and evaluates the serum cytokine profile and total immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels in a subgroup of patients with clinical presentation of either upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) or lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI). A total of 6986 serum samples were tested for specific IgM anti-M. pneumoniae, and a 4-year cyclical incidence of M. pneumoniae infection was confirmed however
