Impact of respiratory syncytial virus in the United States. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is most common in infants and young children, with almost all children experiencing at least one infection by their second birthday.RSV is the leading cause of upper and lower respiratory tract infections in infants and young children, and is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children younger than one year of age. Since infection with RSV does not result in permanent immunity, repeat infections are common, often occurring during the same RSV season. RSV bronchiolitis is the leading cause of hospitalization in children younger than age one, and this virus is associated with approximately 75,000 to 125,000 hospitalizations annually in the United States. Children hospitalized for RSV bronchiolitis during the first year of life are at an increased risk of respiratory problems, such as wheezing and allergic asthma, throughout childhood and into adolescence. RSV-related mortality has decreased over the last 20 years however, RSV is still the leading cause of viral deaths in infants.RSV infection is associated with significant disease burden in infants and young children in terms of hospitalization, related complications, and even mortality. The economic burden resulting from RSV disease is also substantial, with significantly higher costs seen in children with risk factors for severe disease and RSV-related complications.
