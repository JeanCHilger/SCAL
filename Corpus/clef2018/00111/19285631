Incidence and risk factors of early bacterial infections after unrelated cord blood transplantation. Incidence and characteristics of early bacterial infection within 100 days after unrelated cord blood transplantation (UCBT) were assessed for 664 pediatric and 1208 adult recipients in Japan. Cumulative incidence of early bacterial infection at day 100 post-UCBT was 11% (95% confidence interval [CI], 8%-13%) for children and 21% (CI, 19%-24%) for adults (P < .0001). Early bacterial infection in adults had a significant impact on mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.1, CI, 1.7-2.6 P < .0001), although no significant risk factors were identified. Multivariate analysis identified older age group (6-10, and 11-15 years versus 0-5 years of age) at transplant (HR = 2.0 and 2.7, CI, 1.1-3.5 and 1.4-4.9
