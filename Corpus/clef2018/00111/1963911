The significance of body reactivity indices for the diagnosis and treatment of acute pneumonia. The assessment of lymphocytic functional activity and immunological reactivity in 114 cases of acute pneumonia provided additional information on the disease severity, potential complications, effectiveness of the treatment conducted, completeness of recovery. The study of immunological reactivity in acute pneumonia is beneficial in poor clinico-roentgenological manifestations. Combined treatment with levamisole promoted improvement of immunological reactivity and reduced the duration of disability.
