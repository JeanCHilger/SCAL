Comparison of infectious complications during induction/consolidation chemotherapy versus allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Induction/consolidation chemotherapy and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for hematological malignancies are associated with treatment-related risks such as infections. The predominant types of infections are blood stream infections (BSIs) and respiratory tract infections. We prospectively compared infectious complications after induction/consolidation chemotherapy versus allogeneic HSCT in a directly comparable setting with both groups being hospitalized on the same ward. From July 2003 until June 2008, 492 hospitalizations of 321 patients took place 237 chemotherapies and 255 HSCTs were performed. We observed 49 (20.7%) BSIs, 70 (29.5%) pneumonias and 11 (4.6%) probable or proven invasive mould infections in the chemotherapy group. In the HSCT group we detected 70 (27.5%) BSIs, 71 (27.8%) pneumonias and 14 (5.4%) probable or proven invasive mould infections. There was a trend toward more transfers to the intensive care unit (OR 1.61
