Autoantibodies against bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) in children with acute pneumonia. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies directed against bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI), an inhibitor of a lipopolysaccharide of gram-negative bacteria, are a common feature of chronic neutrophilic inflammatory processes such as cystic fibrosis. We investigated whether serum and salivary anti-BPI autoantibodies also appear in the course of acute pneumonia in 24 otherwise healthy children. Nine (38%) and four (17%) patients had detectable serum anti-BPI immunoglobulin G (IgG) (> or =4 IU mL(-1)) and IgA (ratio> or =1.2), respectively, on the day of hospital admission (day 0). There was no increase in the rate of occurrence or the concentration of these antibodies in the convalescent sera obtained on day 30. The presence of anti-BPI IgG on admission did not correlate with inflammatory markers (peripheral white blood cell count, C-reactive protein) or temperature on admission. Also, salivary anti-BPI IgA, determined on days 0, 3-5 and 30, did not appear during the course of acute pneumonia. In summary, a substantial proportion of previously healthy children have pre-existing anti-BPI IgG autoantibodies. Acute neutrophilic infection, i.e. pneumonia, however, neither triggered the appearance of new antibodies nor boosted the concentrations of pre-existing ones. Thus, in typical acute pneumonia in children, autoantibodies directed against BPI may not have clinical significance.
