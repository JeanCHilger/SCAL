Trends in pathogens colonising the respiratory tract of adult patients with cystic fibrosis, 1985-2005. The treatment of patients with CF has continued to evolve. We hypothesised that sputum microbiology may have changed as a result of this.Retrospective analysis of sputum microbiology from adult CF patients (1985 to 2005) using the Royal Brompton Hospital CF database.Colonisation with Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus aureus between 1985 and 2005 remained stable (77 to 82%, p=0.159 54 to 47%, p=0.108P. aeruginosa colonisation has remained stable there has been a decline in B. cepacia complex, H. influenzae and Aspergillus sp., and only a small increase in S. maltophilia and MRSA. Intensive antibiotic strategies have been employed, which, so far, have not resulted in clinically significant emergence of new pathogens.
