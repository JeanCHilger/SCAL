Mycoplasma pneumoniae as a cause of non-resolving pneumonia in a neonate. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is known to be the chief causative organism for community-acquired non-lobar pneumonia in children of 5-15 years of age. M. pneumoniae as an aetiological agent for pneumonia among neonates and infants has rarely been reported. We report here a case of persistent pneumonia due to M. pneumoniae in a 3-week-old neonate.
