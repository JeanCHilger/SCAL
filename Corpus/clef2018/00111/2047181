Production of interleukin-1 by peripheral blood monocytes in children with respiratory diseases. Overall 111 healthy children aged 3 to 7 years, 71 children with ARVI and those aged 2 to 14 years with ARVI complicated by bronchitis and pneumonia were examined. The level and rate of IL-1 production by peripheral blood monocytes in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were determined. It has been established that 98.7% of the healthy children responded to LPS by marked production of IL-1. In 3 children, there was po synthesis of IL-1, in 26.1% of the healthy children, peripheral blood monocytes produced IL-1 without addition of LPS. In children with respiratory bacterial infections, there was a significant increase of IL-1 production as compared to the control. IL-1 production in ARVI was lowered.
