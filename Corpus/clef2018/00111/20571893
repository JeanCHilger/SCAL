Selective IgA deficiency in children in Israel. IgA deficiency is the most common human primary immune-deficiency. We evaluated the clinical and immunological characteristics of selective IgA deficiency in children in Israel. The study group included 63 children diagnosed with IgA deficiency from 1987 to 2005. Mean follow-up time per child was 10.6 years. Average age at diagnosis was 10.5 years. In one child, the IgA deficiency was transient. Infectious diseases, mainly recurrent pneumonia and ear infection, were common and occurred in 25 patients (39.7%). Allergic diseases were documented in 20 (31.7%) of our patients. Thirteen children (20.6%) had autoimmune diseases. Malignancies were diagnosed in three children (4.8%), an association that has not been reported in previous series. IgA deficiency appears to be a risk factor for infections, allergic diseases, autoimmune conditions, and malignancy.
