National swine flu adult assessment guidelines: retrospective validation of objective criteria in three proxy datasets. To validate the objective criteria in the Department of Health Adult Swine Flu Assessment Tool against proxy datasets for pandemic influenza.Comparative validation study with 3 datasets.Urban Emergency Department (group 1) and prehospital care (groups 2 and 3).Adults with community-acquired pneumonia (group 1, n=281), shortness of breath (group 2, n=211) or any respiratory diagnosis (group 3, n=300).Hospital admission (group 1), hospital admission or intravenous therapy (group 2) and transfer to emergency department (group 3).Sensitivity and specificity of the tool were 0.73 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.8) and 0.83 (0.72 to 0.9) in group 1, 0.64 (0.55 to 0.71) and 0.63 (0.52 to 0.73) in group 2 and 0.84 (0.75 to 0.9) and 0.55 (0.48 to 0.62) in group 3. Analysis of individual components of the tool and a summative score is presented.The objective criteria of the proposed DH assessment tool do not perform particularly well in predicting relevant clinical outcomes in feasible proxy conditions for pandemic influenza.
