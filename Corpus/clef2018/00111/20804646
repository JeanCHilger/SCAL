Analysis of risk factors related to mortality of patients with community-acquired pneumonia due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. To describe the clinical features of reported cases of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and to evaluate the risk factors related to outcome.A systematic search of databases from January 1995 to December 2009 was performed. Baseline characteristics of survivors and non-survivors in the hospital were compared with the chi2 test for categorical variables. Variables with P<0.2 were entered in Logistic regression. Survival analysis was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method according to use of antimicrobials inhibiting toxin production.Fifty-two articles were identified reporting data on 74 patients, with 41.1% of total mortality, short duration of symptom onset to death [(6.1+/-11.0) days], and prolonged hospital admissions [(28.6+/-29.1) days]. Logistic regression analysis showed that influenza like symptoms (P=0.04), hemoptysis (P<0.01), leucopenia (P<0.01) were the risk factors associated with death, and using clindamycin or linezolid which could inhibit the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PLV, P<0.01) was the factor associated with survival. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that the antibiotic therapies inhibiting toxin production were associated with improved outcome in these cases (chi2=21.59, P<0.01).CAP due to MRSA is a severe disease with significant lethality. Empiric therapy of severe CAP with flu-like symptoms, hemoptysis and leucopenia should include coverage for MRSA. Targeted treatment with antimicrobials inhibiting toxin production appear to be more appropriate selection.
