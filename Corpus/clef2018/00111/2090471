Aetiology, outcome and prognostic factors in community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization. Outcome and prognostic factors were prospectively studied in 277 adult patients (average age 62 yrs) with community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization. The aetiology was established in 68%, with S. pneumoniae as the predominating agent. Mortality was 4% (12 of 277), and all but one who died were greater than or equal to 60 yrs of age. Features associated with high mortality included greater age, absence of chills and chest pain, high respiratory rate (greater than 30 breaths.min-1) and low serum albumin on admission, and the occurrence of airway colonization and secondary infection during hospital stay. Multivariate analysis showed that low serum albumin and the occurrence of secondary infection, but also absence of chills and airway colonization, were correlated to a higher mortality. In patients who survived, the median length of hospital stay was seven days, and at follow-up, about eight weeks after admission, 81% had recovered and chest X-ray was normal in 84%. In conclusion, we believe that the outcome of community-acquired pneumonia can be influenced by prophylactic measures against pneumococcal infection, and an increased surveillance of risk patients.
