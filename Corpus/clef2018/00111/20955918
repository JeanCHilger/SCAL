Cytologic evaluation can predict microbial culture results for infectious causes of pulmonary nodules in patients undergoing fine needle aspiration biopsy. We retrospectively compared cytopathology and microbial culture results for pulmonary fine needle aspiration biopsy specimens over a 10-year period. Eighty samples were submitted for culture, yielding 24 positive cultures with 17 pathogenic organisms. Cytology predicted positive cultures in all cases where organisms were visualized, and it was associated with negative cultures in 24 of 25 cases where inflammatory changes and necrosis were absent.
