The clinical spectrum of patients with deficiency of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription-1. STAT-1 (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription-1) is a key signaling component of interferon gamma responses. We present long-term manifestations in siblings with a mutation in the STAT1 gene, which include invasive salmonellosis, recurrent severe respiratory syncytial virus pneumonitis, and hepatosplenic mycobacterial disease, and we summarize all other reported cases with STAT-1 deficiency.
