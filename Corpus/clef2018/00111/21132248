Etiology of community acquired pneumonia in children 2-59 months old in two ecologically different communities from Peru. Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major public health problem, being the most affected the pediatric population. The aim of this study was to compare the etiology, clinical and radiological features of CAP in under- five-year-old children.Children have been attended at the Practice or Emergency Room from Puno and Lima health facilities. Twelve pathogens were studied using cultures (bacterial and viral), reaction polymerase chain to S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for M. pneumoniae and indirect immunofluorescence test for C. pneumoniae and viruses (nasal and pharyngeal swabs).One hundred and ninety three children were enrolled with clinical and radiological confirmation of pneumonia between July and November 2006. At least one pathogen was identified in 123 (63.7%) of 193 patients. Fifty five percent had viral infection, 21% bacterial infection and 12% presented viral and bacterial co-infection. The most frequent etiologic agents were respiratory syncytial virus (38.3% from all, 69.8% of viral pneumonias) and S. pneumoniae (18.6% from all, 90% from bacterial pneumonias). In Lima, the cases of severe pneumonia predominated. The association of pneumonia with wheezing was reported in Lima, however, it hasn't been reported in Puno.We found a pathogen in 63.7% of the patients and there were no differences in the proportion and distribution of different identified etiological agents between Lima and Puno health facilities, whose ecological and climatic features are very different. The association of pneumonia with wheezing was only reported in Lima.
