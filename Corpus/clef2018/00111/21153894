Clinical pearls in respiratory diseases. In this section, the authors present some common and some uncommon respiratory cases that have diagnostic and/or therapeutic challenges. First case is of an eight- yr- old child having Acute onset Wheeze and fever, second one is of a 1.5- yr- old Wheezing child not responding to inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids, third of a 4-yr- old with Respiratory distress and wheezing with underlying ventricular septal defect, and fourth of a 5-yr- old with fever for 1 month, epistaxis from right nostril for 15 days, polyuria for 10 days, impaired consciousness and discoloration of right orbit. Each one had some unique pointers to correct diagnosis and management. The authors share clinical learning points from these cases with a concise review of the topic.
