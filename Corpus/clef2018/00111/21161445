Prevalence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae among HIV infected children. To determine the seroprevalence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection among HIV infected children. Also, to correlate various hematological and radiological findings associated with M.pneumoniae infection.This prospective hospital based study enrolled a total of 90 HIV seropositive children presenting with acute pulmonary symptoms, admitted to Pediatric ward of Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences Hospital, Hubli. Patients underwent a thorough physical and radiological examination. IgM ELISA was used to detect specific antibodies against M. pneumoniae. Complete hemogram, liver function tests and CD4 counts were performed for correlation.IgM antibodies specific to M.pneumoniae was detected in 29(32.2%) children. Basal pneumonitis and hilar lymphadenopathy were common radiological findings seen in 11(37.4%) and 7(23.8%) respectively. Typical unilateral interstitial infiltration was seen only in 5(17%) children. Majority 27(93%) of M.pneumoniae infected cases were found anemic. Elevated AST levels were observed in 17(58.6%) of cases. Majority 18 (62%) of children with M.pneumoniae infection were immunosuppressed and the mean CD4% amongst them was 13.9 ± 6.4%.The prevalence of M.pneumoniae infection among HIV seropositive children with respiratory tract infection in the present study is 32.2%. Early detection of M.pneumoniae infection and prompt initiation of therapy may halt further depletion of CD4 cells and rapid progression to AIDS in these patients.
