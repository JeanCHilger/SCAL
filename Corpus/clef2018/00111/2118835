Bacteriologic study of lung infection in 47 cases of burns. The culture results of sputum (SP), blood (BL) and wound secretions (WS) of 47 cases of burns with lung infection were analyzed. Symptoms of pneumonia within 5 days after burn were observed in 90.3% of inhalation injury patients (IIG, 31 cases) whereas only in 25.0% of noninhalation injury patients (NIIG, 16 cases). The isolation rates of Gr(-) bacteria from the 3 sources of culture were markedly higher than those of Gr(+) cocci. The same bacteria, mainly Ps. aeruginosa and Staph. aureus, were identified simultaneously from the 3 sources of culture in 12 cases (25.5%). Isolates from SP correlated well with those from WS, the coincidence rates of 4 main Gr(-) bacteria were over 58%. Ps. aeruginosa was the commonest pathogen of IIG but Staph. aureus was the commonest in SP and BL of NIIG. The isolation rate of fungi of SP in NIIG was about twice that in IIG. Ps. aeruginosa and E. coli were susceptible to Amikacin and Polymixin B, Ps. aeruginosa was more susceptible to Cefoperazone, while the Gr(+) cocci were susceptible to first generation Cephalosporins.
