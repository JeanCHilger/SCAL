Sonographic assessment of ceftriaxone-associated biliary pseudolithiasis in Chinese children. In this randomized, single-blind, case-controlled, prospective study, the incidence and outcome of ceftriaxone-associated biliary pseudolithiasis in Chinese children was evaluated via ultrasonography. A total of 108 children diagnosed with hepatobiliary infection or pneumonia were randomized to receive ceftriaxone or ceftazidime. Serial gallbladder sonograms were obtained on days 1, 5 - 7 and 10 - 14 of therapy. Gallstones were detected in 43.10% of patients in the ceftriaxone-treated group and in 2.00% of the ceftazidime-treated group. The incidence of pseudolithiasis was significantly higher in the ceftriaxone-treated than the ceftazidime-treated group. Biliary precipitation abnormalities appeared after 2 - 7 days of treatment. After gallstones were found, the drug was stopped and symptoms resolved within 1 - 2 days. This study suggests that the risk of ceftriaxone-associated biliary pseudolithiasis should be considered when treating Chinese children.
