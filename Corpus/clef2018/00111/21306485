Demographic characteristics and opportunistic diseases associated with attrition during preparation for antiretroviral therapy in primary health centres in Kibera, Kenya. Using routine data from HIV-positive adult patients eligible for antiretroviral therapy (ART), we report on routinely collected demographic characteristics and opportunistic diseases associated with pre-ART attrition (deaths and loss to follow-up). Among 2471 ART eligible patients, enrolled between January 2005 and November 2008, 446 (18%) were lost to attrition pre-ART. Adjusted risk factors significantly associated with pre-ART attrition included age <35 years (Odds Ratio, OR 1.4, 95% Confidence Interval, CI 1.1-1.8), severe malnutrition (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.0), active pulmonary tuberculosis (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.4), severe bacterial infections including severe bacterial pneumonia (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2-2.8) and prolonged unexplained fever (>1 month), (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.3-5.2). This study highlights a number of clinical markers associated with pre-ART attrition that could serve as 'pointers' or screening tools to identify patients who merit fast-tracking onto ART and/or closer clinical attention and follow-up.
