The first case of Nocardia transvalensis infection in varicella in a previously immunocompetent child. A child referred to Infectious Disease Unit for varicella complicated by pneumonia with pleural effusion. Due to not improvement, laboratory search was extended to uncommon pathogens, revealing Nocardia transvalensis infection. It is likely that varicella induced immunodepression, facilitating opportunistic infection in an otherwise healthy and immunocompetent child. To our knowledge, our report is the first case of Nocardia infection in varicella.
