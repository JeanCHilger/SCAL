Clinical efficacy of reamberine in therapy for influenza. To evaluate the tolerance and therapeutic effectiveness of 1.5% reamberine (RB) solution infusions in complex therapy for pneumonia-complicated pneumonia and acute respiratory diseases (ARD).133 patients aged 18 to 60 years with pneumonia-complicated influenza and ARD were examined. The investigators measured the dynamic serum levels of metalloproteins (MP), such as transferrin, lactoferrin, and ceruloplasmin, and the activity of superoxide dismutase. They also studied the concentration of secondary lipid peroxidation products (malondialdehyde) by the so-called thiobarbituric acid test.Dropwise intravenous RB infusions exerted a modifying effect on MP content, contributed to more pronounced stabilization of a serum antioxidant potential (versus olifen, vitamin E, and basic therapy) and to enhanced nonspecific protection, which was accompanied by a significant clinical improvement.The study revealed the high clinical efficacy of 1.5% RB solution infusions (300 ml for 4-5 days) in the treatment of 74 patients with pneumonia-complicated influenza, stabilized serum antioxidant potential, and the body's enhanced nonspecific resistance.
