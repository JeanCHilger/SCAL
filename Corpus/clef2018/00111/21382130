Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia: a clinical audit. Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) strains are primarily associated with skin and soft tissue infections however, they are increasingly causing more invasive infections including severe community-acquired pneumonia. The objective of this study was to describe the clinico-pathological characteristics of community-acquired MRSA pneumonia.A retrospective analysis of case records from January 2002 to August 2008 was performed on patients admitted with community-acquired MRSA pneumonia to two large teaching hospitals.Sixteen patients with community-acquired MRSA pneumonia were identified. Their age ranged from 11 months to 86 years (median age 30 years). Duration of symptoms before hospital presentation ranged from one to 21 days. Most patients had productive cough, fever and dyspnoea. The most common radiological presentation included multilobar consolidation (8/16), necrotizing consolidation (7/16) and empyema (5/16). Seven patients required intensive care supportCommunity-acquired MRSA pneumonia is increasing and should be suspected in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia. There was a delay in initiation of appropriate antimicrobial treatment that could have lead to increased morbidity.
