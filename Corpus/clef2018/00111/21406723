How I treat acute chest syndrome in children with sickle cell disease. Acute chest syndrome describes new respiratory symptoms and findings, often severe and progressive, in a child with sickle cell disease and a new pulmonary infiltrate. It may be community-acquired or arise in children hospitalized for pain or other complications. Recognized etiologies include infection, most commonly with atypical bacteria, and pulmonary fat embolism (PFE) the cause is often obscure and may be multifactorial. Initiation of therapy should be based on clinical findings. Management includes macrolide antibiotics, supplemental oxygen, modest hydration and often simple transfusion. Partial exchange transfusion should be reserved for children with only mild anemia (Hb > 9 g/dL) but deteriorating respiratory status. Therapy with corticosteroids may be of value
