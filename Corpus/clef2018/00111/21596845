Rapid diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae by polymerase chain reaction in community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections. Two hundred children hospitalized for community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) were investigated for Mycoplasma pneumoniae employing serological tests and a P1 adhesin gene-based polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR) on nasopharyngeal aspirates. Serological evidence of M. pneumoniae infection was observed in 68 (34%) patients and PCR was positive in 20 (10%) children. Together PCR and/or enzyme immuno assay detected M. pneumoniae in 71(35.5%) children. Our data underline the role of M. pneumoniae in Indian children with community-acquired LRTIs even in children aged < 24 months.
