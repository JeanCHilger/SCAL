Chlamydia trachomatis pneumonitis: a case study and literature review. Chlamydia trachomatis was cultured from the lung and eye of an 11-day-old infant who had rapidly deteriorating respiratory symptoms. Chlamydia trachomatis inclusion bodies were identified on thick Epon sections and by electron microscopy. We discuss the unusual presentation and review the published histopathological lung findings.
