The value of fiberoptic bronchoscopy in diagnosis of HIV associated infections. 32 patients with HIV infection presenting with fever or abnormal chest radiograph or both were investigated at the University Hospital of Mainz (FRG). Fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsy was undertaken in each patient, additionally other methods were used for isolating pathogens (i.e. urine sample, stool and blood culture etc.). In 26 patients one or more complicating diseases were documented, in six persons no reason for fever or pulmonary symptoms could be detected. 21 patients had a pulmonary complication, 13 were found to have pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Bacterial lung diseases were diagnosed in seven individuals (three caused by M. tuberculosis, two by S. pneumoniae, one by E. cloacae and one by S. aureus). One nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis was diagnosed. By other diagnostic procedures 25 non-pulmonary complications were established. -Fiberoptic bronchoscopy is most accurate for the detection of pulmonary pathogens in HIV infected persons when transbronchial biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage is combined, especially in pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Bronchoscopy should be performed also if the chest radiograph is normal.
