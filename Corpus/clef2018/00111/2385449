The combination of penicillin G and ofloxacin: a response to the empirical treatment of community acquired pneumonia. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical efficacy of a combination of penicillin G and ofloxacin in the treatment of community acquired pneumonia. Thirty eight patients (23 males, 15 females, mean age 62.8 years +/- 19.6) were included. They presented a CAP with the following criteria: fever, abnormal chest X-ray pattern. They received the combination of IV penicillin 12 x 10(6) U daily and IV ofloxacin 200 mg bid. After 48 hours of apyrexia, this treatment was followed by oral ofloxacin alone 200 mg bid. In six cases, the etiologic agent was identified: 2 S. pneumoniae, 1 Chlamydiae psittaci, 2 Staphylococcus aureus, 1 Mycoplasma. In 32 cases, the bacteriological investigation was negative. Five patients were excluded: 2 deaths due to heart failure, 3 alterations of treatment. Twenty eight patients recovered: apyrexia was obtained in 3.5 days. Penicillin G was prescribed for 7.5 days +/- 2.65, followed by ofloxacin alone for 11.43 +/- 3 days. Five patients were considered as clinical failures: 2 deaths due to extensive pneumonia, 3 recoveries after alteration of treatment. Side effects were rare: 1 confusion, 2 skin rashes. As a conclusion: penicillin G and ofloxacin in combination for the initial therapy of CAP, rapidly relayed by ofloxacin alone, permitted 84.3% of recovery in our patients.
