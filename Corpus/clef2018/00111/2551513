A minor epidemic of pertussis cough in Brno. In the course of six months the authors investigated 32 children aged 1-32 months with pertussoid cough. This number included one child where pertussis was confirmed in a 25-month-old properly vaccinated child and parapertussis in an 8-month-old incompletely vaccinated infant. In the remaining children by cultivation or serological examination a different aetiology was found (RS virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza 2, M. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis).
