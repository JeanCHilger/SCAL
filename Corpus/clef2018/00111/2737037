A retrospective study of 115 cases of fungal pneumonia. 115 cases of immunocompromised patients complicated with fungal pneumonia treated during the period from April 1968 to December 1986 were retrospectively studied. 96 were male and 19 female. Their age ranged from 6 to 84. The incidence increased significantly in recent years especially after 1983. Severe liver disease was the underlying disease in 102 (88.7%) patients. 108 (93.9%) had received antibiotics and 55 (47.9%) corticosteroids. Fungi species isolated were candida in 107 (54.9%), aspergillus in 82 (36.9%), penicillium in 7 (3.6%), mucormycetes in 6 (3%) and reotrichum in 3 (1.5%). Fever, cough, expectoration, moist rales diminished breath sounds and increase of W. B. C. and neutrophils were the important clinical features. The roentgenologic findings vary with the nature and extent of the pathologic process. Disseminated mycoses were found in 9 of the 18 autopsied cases. The characteristic pathologic findings were inflammation, abscess formation, vasculitis, infarction and hemorrhage. Extrapulmonary features such as enteritis, purulent nephritis, abnormal EKG, encephalopathy and rash were present. 93 cases received antifungal therapy including garlicin, clotrimazole, amphotericin B, nystatine, miconazole, 5-fluctosine and ketoconazole. Because these drug combinations were so complex, it is difficult to evaluate their efficiency. However the survival rate was somewhat elevated in recent years. The mortality rate of this series was 80.9%.
