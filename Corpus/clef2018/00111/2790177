Surfactant surface activity and ultrastructural changes in the type-II alveolocytes of fetal and neonatal lungs in experimental inflammation of the maternal lungs. The lungs of 19 guinea pigs, born from 8 females in which acute and chronic pneumonia had been modelled by transtracheal introduction of sterile fishing-line were investigated. It was established, that in guinea pigs, born in females with acute and chronic pneumonia, the functional immaturity of pneumocytes of the 2-nd type took place. The functional immaturity of pneumocytes of the 2-nd type results in suppression of the surface active characteristics of surfactant.
