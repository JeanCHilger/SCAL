Chlamydial and mycoplasmal pneumonias. Chlamydia species and Mycoplasma pneumoniae are among the most common agents of community-acquired pneumonia, as well as causes of various nonpneumonic syndromes. Both can be considered "exotic" bacteria: Chlamydiae because they depend on host cell energy, hence their obligate intracellular replication and M pneumoniae because it is an extracellular parasite that lacks the standard protective bacterial cell wall. The unusual biology of these organisms complicates laboratory diagnosis, but because both are susceptible to selective antimicrobials, therapy often proceeds empirically on clinical suspicion. Generally the respiratory diseases produced are self-limited without significant complications or known sequelae.
