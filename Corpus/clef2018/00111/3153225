Fungal pneumonias masquerading as thromboses during induction therapy of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Fatal fungal pneumonias developed in two children with ALL during remission induction. Pulmonary and central nervous system signs suggested the L-asparaginase-induced multiple-thromboses syndrome in both children. Fungal infection should be considered-whenever pneumonia develops in a neutropenic child already receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics or when multiple thromboses occur.
