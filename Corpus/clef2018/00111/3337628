Pseudomonas cepacia-associated pneumonia in cystic fibrosis. Relation of clinical features to histopathologic patterns of pneumonia. We studied lungs at autopsy from 40 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) to determine the structural and clinicopathologic features of pneumonia associated with Pseudomonas cepacia respiratory tract colonization. Three clinical groups were identified: group A included 11 patients exhibiting a fulminant course following P cepacia colonization group B included 20 patients who declined slowly following colonization
