Adult community-acquired staphylococcal pneumonia in the antibiotic era: a review of 61 cases. We have reviewed the clinical and laboratory features of 61 cases of adult community-acquired staphylococcal pneumonia. A seasonal incidence was found and most cases occurred in April. Clinical and laboratory features were similar to those found in other forms of community-acquired pneumonia. Sputum Gram-stain was positive for staphylococci in 69 per cent of cases and blood cultures were positive in 20 per cent. Evidence of Influenza virus infection was found in 52 per cent of cases. Eighteen patients died (30 per cent). Age greater than 45 years, confusion, reduced conscious level, raised blood urea, acidosis, bacteraemia and admission to the intensive care unit were associated significantly with death. Despite appropriate antibiotic treatment mortality in staphylococcal pneumonia remains high.
