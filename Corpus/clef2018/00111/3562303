Afebrile pneumonitis in infants: predictors of outcome. This study was performed to determine which elements of the history, physical examination, and laboratory data of infants with afebrile pneumonitis predict the need for hospitalization. We used a risk score based on clinical history and a respiratory score based on the respiratory physical examination, to assess 101 infants with afebrile pneumonitis in the emergency department. Admission and length of hospitalization were decided independently of the study. The population was divided into three groups depending on outcome: mild disease--outpatient management or hospitalization for up to 48 hours moderate disease--three or more days of hospitalization
