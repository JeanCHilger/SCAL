Postinflammatory pseudotumor of the lung in childhood. A case of postinflammatory pseudotumor of the upper lobe of the right lung in a 5-year-old girl is reported who presented with recurrent feverish throat infections until the time of diagnosis. Right-sided pneumonectomy with partial resection of the v. cava and the carina was performed due to anatomical situs and the unclear dignity of the intraoperative frozen-section. The patient is in excellent condition 11 years following operation, her growth being entirely normal. At the example of this rare, benign, tumorous lung disease which is difficult to judge radiologically and which must be removed surgically for diagnostic an therapeutical reasons the problems are discussed.
