Results using a quantitative method for evaluating the severity and dynamics of acute pneumonia, chronic bronchitis and bronchial asthma. The authors describe the results of application during 6 months of a quantitative method involving the use of the clinical and laboratory indicators of the disease gravity in routine medical work, which included correction of the therapeutic tactics as regards the immunological characteristics in 668 patients with acute pneumonia, 1100 with chronic bronchitis, and 120 with bronchial asthma. The use of the indicators of the disease gravity made it possible to objectively evaluate the gravity and the time-course of the diseases under consideration, to decide on the etiological treatment, to control the treatment efficacy and make necessary corrections, to specify the time of administration and withdrawal of biological stimulation, as well as to define the time of convalescence or remission. The authors have developed indications and specified contraindications as to the use of passive immunization and biological (immunocorrective) stimulation in the management of acute pneumonia.
