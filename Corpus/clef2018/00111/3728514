Multiple lung cavities in a 12-year-old girl with bubonic plague, sepsis, and secondary pneumonia. After one week of nonspecific symptoms, pneumonia and an extremely tender and enlarged cervical lymph node developed in a 12-year-old girl who lived in an area of New Mexico known to have plague-infected rodents. Cultures from an aspirate of the node, her sputum, and blood all showed growth of Yersinia pestis. She was treated successfully with aminoglycosides and tetracycline. As the pneumonia resolved, areas of consolidation were replaced by cavitary lesions.
