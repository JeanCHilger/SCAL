Serotyping of Haemophilus pleuropneumoniae by rapid slide agglutination and indirect fluorescent antibody tests in swine. One hundred and forty-one isolates of Haemophilus pleuropneumoniae from Iowa and Illinois swine were characterized morphologically and biochemically and serotyped by rapid slide agglutination (RSA) and indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) tests. Hyperimmune antisera were produced in rabbits using inactivated whole-cell suspensions of the reference strains for H pleuropneumoniae serotypes 1 to 7 and strain 202, representing the taxon "minor group." Cross testing of the reference strains and reference antisera indicated the antisera to be essentially serotype-specific, although reactivity of some antisera with heterologous strains was observed. Cultures of the 141 isolates formed adherent or smooth colonies or mixtures of these colony forms. Adherent and smooth colony types were found in all serotypes identified. Microscopic and biochemical characteristics of all isolates were typical of those previously described for H pleuropneumoniae. The overall incidence of H pleuropneumoniae serotypes was serotype 5, 55.3% serotype 1, 34.0%
