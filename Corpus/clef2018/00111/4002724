Pathologic anatomy and mechanism of brain tissue damage in Mycoplasma infection based on a case report. The following report deals with the pathological findings in severe brain tissue damage secondary to Mycoplasma infection with positive serological identification. The patient, a girl of 4 1/2 years, presented with the clinical signs of severe cerebral damage of acute onset and succumbed after an illness of 74 days. Autopsy revealed extensive cortical necrosis in one hemisphere with focal necrosis in the basal ganglia of the opposite hemisphere, together with demyelination and marked glial reaction. Although the changes suggest damage due to circulatory factors, the brain vessels appear normal. Disseminated intravascular coagulation appears to be the most likely pathogenesis.
