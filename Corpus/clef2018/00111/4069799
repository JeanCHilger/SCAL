Parental smoking and respiratory illness during early childhood: a six-year longitudinal study. The relationship between parental smoking habits and lower respiratory illness and symptoms during the first 6 years of life was studied in a birth cohort of New Zealand children. This showed that maternal (but not paternal) smoking was associated with significant increase in rates of lower respiratory infection and lower respiratory symptoms during the child's first 2 years. This association persisted when a range of perinatal, social, and familial factors were taken into account statistically. After two years there was no detectable association between parental smoking habits and lower respiratory infection. Further, there was no evidence to suggest that children whose parents smoked had increased risks of asthma or rates of asthmatic attacks during early childhood.
