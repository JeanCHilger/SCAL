Circulating megakaryocytes in patients with pulmonary inflammation and in patients subjected to cholecystectomy. 30 patients with pulmonary inflammation and 17 patients subjected to cholecystectomia Ã  froid were investigated for circulating megakaryocytes in a cubital vein using the saponin-haemolysis leucoconcentration technique. The number of circulating megakaryocytes was significantly higher in patients with pulmonary inflammation than in healthy humans. In 15 patients with bronchitis, bronchopneumonia, and leucocytosis the arithmetic mean was 15.6 megakaryocytes per 1.5 ml blood (range 3 to 47). In 15 patients with bronchitis and a normal leucocyte count the arithmetic mean was similarly 14.1 megakaryocytes per 1.5 ml blood. After cholecystectomy a significant maximum increase in the number of circulating megakaryocytes to 3 times the preoperative value was found on the third postoperative day but not on the other postoperative days. Of the observed megakaryocytes 99% had only a narrow rim of cytoplasm or were naked nuclei.
