Subphrenic abscess: roentgen considerations. Roentgen findings in subphrenic abscess, in the order of their specificity and clinical value, are subphrenic air-fluid level, elevation and restriction of motion of the diaphragm, pleural reaction with congestion, segmental atelectasis or pneumonitis at the lung base and upper abdominal mass. Less frequently there may be empyema or bronchopleural fistula. Suppression of the infection by antibiotics may protract the course and obscure the clinical findings. Serial x-ray and fluoroscopic studies are recommended when a patient who has had rupture of a viscus or previous abdominal operation does not completely recover or has a persistent lowgrade fever.
