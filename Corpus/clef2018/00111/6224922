Esophageal dysfunction in Down's syndrome. Abnormalities in esophageal function were identified in seven children with Down's syndrome. Three had recurrent episodes of pneumonia from gastroesophageal reflux two of these and one other patient had esophageal strictures. Two patients with Down's syndrome revealed no evidence of gastroesophageal reflux but did show significant abnormalities in esophageal peristalsis. These data would suggest that ambulatory children with Down's syndrome may be at risk of developing serious sequellae of gastroesophageal reflux. The spectrum of data of these seven patients is discussed, and pertinent prior reports from the literature are reviewed.
