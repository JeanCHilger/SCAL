Stevens-Johnson syndrome and pulmonary infection by Mycoplasma pneumonia (author's transl). The case-report of an eleven-year-old boy presenting with the association of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and pulmonary symptoms is studied. The course of the disease covered two distinct periods since a one-month interval occurred between the two cutaneo-mucous and pulmonary episodes. Mycoplasma Pneumoniae infection was confirmed by positive seroconversion. The child recovered without sequelae. Indirect immunofluorescence transitorily showed anticytoplasmic antibodies directed against basal epidermic cells. These antibodies were not fixed on the lesions as shown by direct immunofluorescence. The possible connexion between Stevens-Johnson syndrome, Mycoplasma Pneumoniae infection and anticytoplasmic antibodies is under discussion.
