Pi type MZ and an increased risk of pneumonia. Among 114 men of Pi type or MZ, 42% (17/40) of those of Pi type MZ reported having been told by a physician that they had had pneumonia at least once whereas only 18% (13/74) of those of Pi type M did so (p less than 0.05). This significant difference could not be accounted for by differences in age, smoking status, occupation or baseline lung function (FEV1). Examination of medical records of those reporting pneumonia for the preceding 20 years provided confirmation of the diagnosis of pneumonia and support for the association 12% (5/40) of the MZ group but only 3% (2/74) of the M group had confirmed episodes of pneumonia during the preceding 20 years. Since alpha 1-antitrypsin has been implicated as a factor in inflammatory response, reduced levels may permit the development of more frequent and/or more serious episodes of pneumonia.
