Miconazole in the treatment of coccidioidomycosis. Intravenous miconazole can produce responses in patients with various manifestations of coccidioidal disease, even if they have failed to respond to amphotericin B. In 4 large series of 33, 33, 46 and 31 courses of miconazole for skin and soft tissue, chronic pulmonary, meningeal and skeletal coccidioidomycosis, response rates of 40, 72, 31 and 32%, respectively, were achieved 60, 75, 78 and 56%, respectively, of those responding subsequently relapsed at the site(s) of earlier involvement. This suggests that the therapeutic effect of the relatively brief courses used (mean, 1 to 3 months) is fungistatic in vivo. Common side effects of intravenous miconazole include phlebitis, pruritus, anaemia, thrombocytosis, hyponatraemia, nausea, hyperlipidaemia, vomiting, central nervous system effects, and rashes. The place of miconazole relative to amphotericin B and ketoconazole has not been determined, and requires further comparative studies. Information on the results of different regimens, particularly longer courses, would also be of interest.
