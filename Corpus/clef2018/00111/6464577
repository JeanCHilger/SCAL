Determination of alveolar macrophage function in nonspecific lung diseases by the simultaneous estimation of phagocytosis and acid phosphatase activity. The aim of this investigation was to increase the accuracy of the determination of the functional activity of alveolar macrophages with phagocytic functions, isolated from bronchial washings, to reduce the time necessary for this determination and to compare the results thus obtained with the clinical signs of the disease. 46 patients with nonspecific pulmonary diseases were examined. The method of the simultaneous evaluation of the phagocytic activity of alveolar macrophages and the level of acidic phosphatase activity during phagocytosis was found to ensure greater accuracy in the determination of the functional activity of alveolar macrophages and to reduce the time necessary for the evaluation of the reaction by 1.5 hours. In patients with non-specific pulmonary diseases the phagocytic activity of alveolar macrophages decreased, which was accompanied by a lower level of acidic phosphatase consumption.
