Complications of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome in pregnancy. A case report. The Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a disorder of the connective tissue characterized by hyperextensible skin, loose jointedness, fragile tissues, bruising and bleeding diathesis. At least eight subtypes of EDS are recognized, each one with different clinical manifestations. On rare occasions EDS is associated with pregnancy. These patients are at risk for bleeding disorders and vascular, surgical and anesthetic complications as well as for premature labor, postpartum hemorrhage, bladder and uterine prolapse, abdominal hernias and wound dehiscence. We treated a pregnant patient for type 1 EDS and pregnancy-induced hypertension.
