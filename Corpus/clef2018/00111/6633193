Early and late changes in the lungs following irradiation of the mediastinum (based on studies of patients with lymphogranulomatosis). In a group of 180 patients with Hodgkin's disease who received irradiation of the mediastinum, 23 (12.7%) developed shortly after that (up to 6 mos.) the signs of radiation pulmonitis, later on 171 (95%) local paramediastinal fibrosis. Radiation changes revealed were either subclinical or asymptomatic. The frequency of early radiation changes and the extent of local fibrosis depend on the volume of irradiated pulmonary tissue. The summary focal doses within the range of 31-45Gy are less important.
