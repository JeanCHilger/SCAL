Complications of total nodal irradiation of Hodgkin's disease stages III and IV. One hundred twenty-seven patients with Hodgkin's disease, Stages III-IV, received total nodal irradiation. Of these, 101 patients were managed primarily by radiation therapy employing the split course sequential segmental radiation technique called the "3 & 2".
