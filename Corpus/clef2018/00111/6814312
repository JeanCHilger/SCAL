An outbreak of mycoplasma pneumoniae respiratory illness in a semi-closed religious commune. Of approximately 200 members of a religious commune, 37 came to the emergency department of Cook County Hospital for primary medical care of respiratory illness. Of the 37, 31 were seen during a two-week period, indicating a rapid spread of disease. The major symptoms were cough, fever, coryza, and sore throat. Infiltrates were detected in 38%. Paired sera from four of nine patients showed a significant rise to Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Of 24 sera collected at the time of the first visit, 33% had a titer to the agent, of 64 or greater--presumptive evidence of Mycoplasma infection. Therefore, M pneumoniae was implicated as the causative agent in this outbreak of respiratory illness in a semi-closed community.
