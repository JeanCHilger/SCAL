Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common pathogen. Children and young adults are at particular risk, especially if they are living in closed communities. As many as one in five persons with M. pneumoniae infection may develop pneumonia. Infection is endemic within the community, with two peaks of incidence each year. Early diagnosis requires recognition of the disease pattern, although the chest radiograph may be helpful. Tetracycline and erythromycin are effective therapy.
