Clinical experiences with intravenous immunoglobulin therapy of infectious diseases in infancy and childhood. In 26 infants with severe sepsis antibacterial therapy was supplemented by the intravenous administration of immunoglobulins (Endobulin, Immuno AG, Vienna). Such therapy was indicated in 6 patients by the appearance of granulocytopenia during the treatment of their underlying disease, in 14 children by their very young age which was less than 2 years, and in 6 children by the failure of antibacterial therapy to produce the desired effect. Depending on the clinical picture of sepsis different organ manifestations were seen, purulent meningitis (10 cases) and pneumonia (9 cases) being the most frequent. In 24 patients immunoglobulin therapy led to complete recovery. In all 7 cases of purulent meningitis, the simultaneous administration of antibiotics and immunoglobulins was effective.
