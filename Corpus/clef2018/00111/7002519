The gram-negative bacillary pneumonias. With increasing age, chronic underlying disease, and debility, the oropharyngeal flora are colonized with aerobic gram-negative bacilli. In this debilitated population, gram-negative bacillary pneumonias (GNBP) are increasingly common. GNBP account for two of every three pneumonia deaths today. As a group, the mortality of GNBP is about 50%. Although the original epidemiologic surveys were done 15 years ago, there is little evidence for an improving case fatality rate despite the appearance of aminoglycoside antibiotics, carbenicillin, and cephalosporins. In susceptible patients, GNBP pneumonias occur both in the community and as nosocomial infections. Recognition of the dangers of contaminated reservoir nebulizers or other similar devices used in inhalation therapy has led to epidemiologic measures within hospitals that have markedly decreased the incidence of this nosocomial GNBP. The role of Gram stain and culture of expectorated sputum and similar examinations of specimens obtained by transtracheal aspiration, fiberoptic bronchoscopy, and lung biopsy in the diagnosis of GNBP are discussed in this review (see Criteria for Diagnosis). In the presence of pulmonary emphysema, congestive heart failure, mixed gram-negative bacillary infections, or the use of immunosuppressive drugs, typical characteristics of individual GNBP may not be apparent. Typical features of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter, Proteus, Hemophilus, and anaerobic pulmonary infections are described. Early recognition and institution of appropriate antibacterial agents are emphasized, particularly in GNBP caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, or Friedl√§nder's bacillus, where the mortality approaches 70%. The mortality of GNBP, including Enterobacter, Proteus, Hemophilus, and anaerobic GNBP, is about 20%. The latter figure is the same as the mortality of pneumococcal pneumonia in similar patients.
