Gastroesophageal reflux with respiratory manifestations. Manometric and pH-metric study. Gastroesophageal reflux can be found in patients with respiratory tract disease even in the absence of vomiting. A manometric and pH-metric study carried out in 69 children with radiologic reflux (of whom 49 had respiratory symptoms) and 10 normal controls has shown: 1. lower esophageal sphincter pressure was lower in refluxing patients than in controls, but values were significant only for those with vomiting 2. all parameters of prolonged esophageal pH-metry indicating reflux were very significantly abnormal in the group of respiratory patients who were by this respect very similar to vomiting refluxers
