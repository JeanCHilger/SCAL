Cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis combined with immune haemolytic anaemia or bronchial asthma. This study deals with the rare occurrence of cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis together with adventitious immune haemolytic anaemia respectively bronchial asthma. In literature the above mentioned first combination form is the second, and histologically the first case being proved. The author has not met references to the simultaneous incidence of cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis and endogenic bronchial asthma. In spite of this he believes that the described associations may be more frequent, but can be hardly diagnosed, because the symptoms of connective tissue diseases can merge one into another and seldom develop discernibly. The separation of diseases, having common immunopathological origin and associating one with another, but at the same time being not identified one with another, is the condition of the adequate and up-to-date therapy. In the premised combinations of diseases both simultaneous syntropy and successive syntropy are probable. The histologically confinable distinct forms of cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis are noticeable when they occur together with other immunopathological diseases.
