Severe mycoplasma pneumonia in previously healthy children. Mycoplasma pneumonia usually follows a benign course and the patient does not require hospitalization. The present report summarizes the feature of eight children admitted for a moderately severe pneumonia during an epidemic of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in Victoria. All children were previously healthy. The usual presenting symptoms included cough, fever, lethargy, and weight loss. All children had moderately severe respiratory distress and physical signs in the chest consistent with extensive parenchymal involvement. Half of this group had radiological evidence of a small pleural effusion. Complement fixation titres for Mycoplasma pneumoniae in paired samples confirmed the diagnosis. Clinical and radiological resolution was complete after one to three months. It is suggested that severe mycoplasma pneumonia may be more common than previously appreciated.
