Carcinoid tumor of the lung in childhood--review and case report (author's transl). Carcinoid tumors of the lung are rare in childhood. Still they have to be taken in account as a possible reason for chronic pneumonitis, (with) cough or even hemoptysis. Misinterpretation of symptoms is the cause for the frequently long time lapse before the correct diagnosis is established. The crucial examinations are the history of symptoms, chest X-ray, tomography, and bronchoscopy, which lead to the correct diagnosis in about 75% of the cases. Treatment of choice is operative, with the aim to conserve as much functioning lung as possible. Radiotherapy has only palliative effects. The prognosis is rather good for the carcinoid tumor of the lung in general, 80% achieve a 5 years survival rate. The carcinoid tumor of the lung is now as for the newest definition defined as a separate group and should not be mixed up with "bronchial adenomas". Adenoid cystic carcinoma (cylindroma) and mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the bronchus are defined as carcinomas and believed to arise from respiratory glands.
