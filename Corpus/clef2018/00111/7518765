Comparative clinical efficacy of cefetamet pivoxil in lower respiratory tract infection. Cefetamet pivoxil, because of its activity against respiratory pathogens and its pharmacokinetic behaviour, is expected to have clinical efficacy in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). This paper presents an overview of clinical trials conducted worldwide to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of cefetamet pivoxil in the treatment of adults and children with LRTI. A total of 626 adult patients, the majority of whom presented with exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (n = 500), received oral cefetamet pivoxil 500 or 1000mg twice daily for 5 to 10 days (n = 351) or a standard comparator agent (n = 275). The comparator agents were amoxicillin (750mg 3 or 4 times daily, or 1000mg twice daily), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (625mg 3 times daily), or cefaclor (250 or 500mg 3 times daily) administered for 5 to 12 days. A satisfactory clinical outcome (cure + improvement) was achieved in 79 to 94% of evaluable patients. In 336 children, 240 received cefetamet pivoxil at 2 dosage levels (10 or 20 mg/kg twice daily) for 7 to 12 days and 96 received the standard comparator, cefaclor (10 mg/kg 3 times daily). Cefetamet pivoxil was clinically effective at both dosages, and did not differ significantly compared with cefaclor (clinical cure rates of 97 to 99% with cefetamet pivoxil and 96% with cefaclor). A separate analysis of 305 patients with community-acquired pneumonia showed clinical successes in 80 to 100% of adults, 75 to 78% of elderly patients, and 98% of children treated with cefetamet pivoxil.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
