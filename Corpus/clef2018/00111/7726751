Investigation into the therapeutic efficacy of continuous isoproterenol inhalation in relation to respiratory infections in asthmatic children. In our Department, continuous isoproterenol inhalation therapy has been conducted on status asthmatics over the last 10 years. In the present study, we investigated whether there are any differences in the therapeutic efficacy of continuous inhalation of isoproterenol in the presence or absence of respiratory infections which may induce or aggravate asthma attacks. The treatment period was significantly longer in patients with pneumonia. Further prolongation of the treatment period was noted in patients with atelectasis. However, there were no apparent differences in therapeutic efficacy according to age or the severity of attacks. These findings suggest that continuous inhalation of isoproterenol is very effective for status asthmatics if respiratory infections are thoroughly controlled.
