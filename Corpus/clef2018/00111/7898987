Experimental neonatal group B streptococcal pneumonia: effect of a modified porcine surfactant on bacterial proliferation in ventilated near-term rabbits. We studied bacterial proliferation in relation to surfactant treatment in a model of neonatal group B streptococcal (GBS) pneumonia. Surfactant (Curosurf) was isolated from pig lungs with a method preserving only polar lipids and hydrophobic proteins. Near-term rabbit fetuses were ventilated in a body plethysmograph system. At 15 min, a suspension of GBS strain 090 Ia LD (5 mL/kg, concentration approximately 10(9)/mL) was instilled intratracheally. At 30 min, surfactant (n = 12) or sterile saline (n = 13) was administered via the airways (2.5 mL/kg). A control group (n = 12) received the same volumes of saline. After 5 h the animals were killed, and samples for blood cultures and blood gases were taken from the heart. The left lung was aseptically removed, weighed, homogenized, serially diluted, and cultured on blood agar plates. The results were expressed as mean log10 colony forming units/g lung +/- SD. Compared with animals (n = 12) killed immediately after GBS instillation (8.13 +/- 0.54), there was a significant increase in bacterial numbers in both groups ventilated for 5 h, but values for surfactant-treated animals (8.96 +/- 0.38) were lower than those for animals receiving saline (9.46 +/- 0.50 p < 0.05). After 5 h, 96% of GBS-infected animals had positive blood cultures. Light microscopic examination of the right lung of GBS-infected animals revealed inflammatory changes that tended to be less prominent in surfactant-treated rabbits. We conclude that intratracheal inoculation of near-term rabbits with GBS resulted in a significant bacterial proliferation during 5 h of ventilation and that bacterial growth was mitigated by treatment with surfactant.
