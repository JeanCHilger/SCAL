Findings of digital intensive or bed lung radiographs at the monitor vs. hard copy: a clinical ROC study. 45 bedside chest examinations acquired with storage phosphorus radiography, were displayed on a viewing box as single-format hard copies and at a high-performance digital reporting console. 6 observers performed an ROC study. For the pathologies under question, significantly better results were shown in monitor reporting due to pneumonic infiltration whereas no significant differences were found for pulmonary or mediastinal masses, or for pneumothoraces.
