Adult response to initial treatment with ampicillin in community acquired pneumonia in Yaound√©, Cameroon. A prospective study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of ampicillin as an initial therapy in 60 adult patients with community acquired pneumonia. Bacteriological etiology was obtained only in 24 (40pc) patients by microscopic examination, culture and antigen detection. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the leading causative agent identified in 15 cases. Other etiologies were Klebsiella pneumoniae (3), Streptococcus pyogenes (2) Staphylococcus aureus (2), Haemophilus influenzae (1) and Moraxella catarrhails (1). Patients were started on ampicillin one gram twice daily, empirically, and treated for 10 days. There were 52(86.7pc) patients cured, two(3.3pc) patients improved and six (10pc) were therapeutic failures. The causative agents in patients with failures were: Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Staphylococcus aureus (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1) and unknown in three cases. Only six of 60 patients still febrile after three days were switched to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid or cefaclor according to culture results and susceptibilities or to roxythromycin because no organisms were isolated. Side effects were observed in only one (1.7pc) patient who developed a mild skin rash. Due to its low cost and its high efficacy, ampicillin still appears to be the drug of choice in adult community acquired pneumonia in our region.
