Fluconazole therapy for pediatric patients with severe candidal infections. Three children with severe candidal infections were treated with fluconazole (FLCZ). An excellent effect or a partial effect was obtained in each case. Case 1 was a boy with candida esophagitis. He had been treated for relapsed ALL and became febrile with severe swallowing pain. FLCZ was administered intravenously and he became afebrile after 10 days of the therapy. Case 2 was a boy with candida pneumonitis. He had been treated for relapsed ALL and became febrile with diffuse infiltration in chest X-ray. FLCZ was administered intravenously and he became afebrile transiently, though fever and abnormal X-ray shadows reappeared soon and died of pneumonia and leukemic infiltrations. Case 3 was a girl with candida pneumonitis. She had been treated for relapsed neuroblastoma and became febrile and dyspneic. She was treated with intravenous FLCZ with no effects and died of pneumonia. All three patients showed positive results in 2 of 3 markers for candida infection, including, Cand-Tec, D-arabinitol and fungal index. FLCZ was well tolerated and no adverse effects or abnormal laboratory test results were observed. FLCZ was considered as an effective and safe antifungal agent in the treatment for fungal infections in children.
