Cefadroxil reduces the production of IgE in a 3 year old asthmatic with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Cefadroxil, a cephalosporin, had been prescribed to children with superinfected atopic dermatitis, and was shown to improve both the infection, the clinical status and induced a dramatic lowering of the serum total IgE levels. Further studies have confirmed the IgE immunomodulating properties of cefadroxil. We report the case of a 3 year old asthmatic child who was hospitalized for superimposed pneumonia and was included in a study evaluating cefadroxil. The child was also suffering of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. After treatment with cefadroxil and oral salbutamol, the child fully recovered. The initially elevated serum IgE (day 1:556 IU/ml) dropped to normal values (day 21: 52 IU/ml), while the production of IgE in vitro by peripheral blood B cells was normalized. We suggest that one mechanism of action of cefadroxil is the stimulation of production of gamma interferon in patients with atopic disorders this mechanism interferes with the IL-4 primary signal, as well as with other second signals recognized for the synthesis of IgE. Gamma interferon may also prove beneficial for the control of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.
