The focal encephalopathies associated with mycoplasma pneumoniae. Five patients with evidence of focal encephalopathy are reported. In each case, evidence of mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was detected. No patient improved with conventional antibiotic therapy, but in three subjects, rapid and complete recovery did occur contemporaneously with the administration of high dose steroid therapy. It is suggested that focal as well as diffuse cerebral or cerebellar lesions may occur as manifestations of auto-immune disease complicating mycoplasmal infections in young people and that this illness may be designated as acute mycoplasma-associated encephalopathy.
