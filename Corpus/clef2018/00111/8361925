To differentiate viral, chlamydial, and mycoplasmal infections from bacterial disease in office and in emergency room practice, a combination of epidemiologic and clinical features usually will suggest one or a few microorganisms. Following that, laboratory diagnosis can be more targeted. Definition of the specific etiology will enable the proper management choice of antibiotics, antivirals, or symptomatic therapy.
