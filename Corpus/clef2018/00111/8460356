Association of pneumonia and lung cancer: the value of convalescent chest radiography and follow-up. A retrospective study of 1011 hospitalized patients with pneumonia was undertaken to assess the value of routine convalescent chest radiography for detection of underlying lung cancer. To investigate the mode of clinical onset of pulmonary carcinoma, 232 inpatients with this diagnosis were also studied. The findings may be summarized as follows: 1) 13/1011 pneumonia patients were found to have previously undiagnosed pulmonary carcinoma 2) many of these carcinomas (8/13) were disclosed by an acute chest X-ray
