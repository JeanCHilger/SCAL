Copper and ceruloplasmin concentrations in serum of infants with pneumonia. Copper constitute one of the most significant trace metal for the organism. Numerous biochemical processes depend on this element. It constitute component and activator of many enzymes. In blood serum copper is bound with ceruloplasmin. In this work the behavior of copper and ceruloplasmin concentration in blood serum in the course of pneumonia in infant was investigated. 36 infants aged 2 months trough 12 months with pneumonia were included in the study. The control group consisted of 14 healthy infants. Tests were conducted thrice in the group of sick infants. In the acute stage of pneumonia in sick infants the authors showed higher copper and ceruloplasmin concentration values. After the therapy ended the concentration of those values were similar to those in the control group.
