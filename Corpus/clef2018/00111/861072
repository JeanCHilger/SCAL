Known and newer manifestations by mycoplasma pneumoniae in adults. Although M. pneumoniae is a well recognised respiratory pathogen both in children and in young adults, its infections have shown recently some pathomorphism and may also involve other organ systems. The paper reviews the various clinical syndromes in adults by M. pneumoniae, with particular emphasis on those more unusual and nevertheless seen by us. In this connection the possibility of pleural effusions (with a well defined cytology) associated or not with typical Mycoplasma pneumoniae and of chronic bronchopneumonias eventually evolving even in pulmonary fibrosis is stressed. Moreover, the development of M. pneumoniae respiratory infections during the course or hematological malignancies and their characteristics are described in some detail because of the relative rarity of this kind of infections in the above patients. Finally, some less frequently reported manifestations of M. pneumoniae infections, as hemolytic anemia, hepatitis and others are described and discussed.
