Acute sensorineural hearing loss caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Four cases with acute sensorineural hearing loss on one side and one case with bilateral ear fullness associated with Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) were described. These cases were characterized by highly elevated MP complement fixation titer, and cold hemagglutinin titer. All patients experienced cochlear symptoms in an early stage following common cold. In all cases, clarythromycin (CAM) had been administered for 10 days, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), vitamin B1, B12, and prednisolone were concurrently administered for 14 days. Two cases with acute hearing loss and one case with ear fullness returned to normal hearing after treatment. The other cases were remarkably improved in hearing level. MP is a common causative agent for protein respiratory disease. The true incidence of hearing loss in this disease may be higher than has been reported so far. Prompt diagnosis possibly facilitates the administration of specific treatment and leads to good prognosis.
