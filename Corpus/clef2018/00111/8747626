Pneumonia in unexpected locations: an occult cause of pediatric abdominal pain. Although pneumonia is a known cause of pediatric abdominal pain, it may go unrecognized on a patient's initial evaluation. This is particularly true when the infection lies outside of the typically described basilar location. We report three pediatric patients in whom acute abdominal pain was the sole or primary manifestation of a nonbasilar pneumonia.
