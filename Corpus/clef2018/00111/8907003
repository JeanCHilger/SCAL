A review of the serological results obtained in a routine diagnostic laboratory for Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections. The results of a Mycoplasma pneumoniae serology test performed routinely at the Bacteriology Division, Institute for Medical Research were reviewed. A total of 1402 patients were screened over a period of 4 years (January, 1990-December, 1993), of which 327 (23.3%) were seropositive. The seropositivity rates among Malays, Chinese and Indians were 25.2, 25.4 and 17.8% respectively. The male to female ratio was 1:1. The age specific rate was highest amongst patients of the 6-12 years (35.1%) followed by the 13-20 years age groups (35.0%). In general, infection with M. pneumoniae appears to be relatively common in this country.
