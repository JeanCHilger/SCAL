Radiographic appearance of intrathoracic complications of pregnancy. The authors reviewed all chest radiographs obtained for pregnant women at a university hospital over a 15-year period to determine the intrathoracic complications of pregnancy and diseases occurring during pregnancy. The characteristic physiologic changes seen on chest radiographs during normal pregnancy are reviewed. Examples of intrathoracic diseases that may occur in pregnant patients include pulmonary embolism, amniotic fluid embolism, beriberi, aspiration pneumonia, community-acquired pneumonia, viral pneumonia, asthma, systemic disease, trophoblastic disease and peripartum pulmonary edema. The authors discuss the radiation biology implications of performing chest radiography during pregnancy and conclude that the benefit that the fetus receives from diagnosis and treatment of the mother's disease may be greater than the risk of radiation exposure.
