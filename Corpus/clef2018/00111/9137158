The efficacy of open lung biopsy. The morbidity and mortality of open lung biopsy was assessed, and the ability to provide a specific diagnosis in the assessment of patients with diffuse radiographic pulmonary infiltrates was determined.A retrospective analysis was undertaken from January 1990 to May 1995 of all patients undergoing open lung biopsy during the study period. A total of 127 biopsies were performed. The indications were diffuse, infiltrative or multinodular disease. Forty-two (33%) patients had previously undergone non-diagnostic trans-bronchial biopsy.Open lung biopsy obtained a histological diagnosis in 121 (95.3%) patients. Postoperative in-hospital mortality was 4.7% (six patients). Three of the four patients being ventilated at the time of biopsy died. Thirty-six (28.3%) patients suffered one or more morbid events. Patients with decreased lung function, as measured by forced expiratory volume, experienced a higher risk of a morbid event (P < 0.01). There was no significant correlation between the chance of a morbid event and age, sex or the use of multiple biopsy sites. A presumptive diagnosis was made prior to biopsy in 71 patients (55.9%) and was proven correct in 43.6% of cases.Open lung biopsy in patients with diffuse pulmonary disease is an accurate diagnostic tool and has an acceptable morbidity and mortality associated with the procedure.
