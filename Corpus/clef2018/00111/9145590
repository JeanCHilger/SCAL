A study on Q fever among children hospitalized for pneumonia. The epidemiological features of Q fever make it of less consequence in childhood. However, the disease is quite possible to be contracted at this age due to the great number of indirect modes of agent transmission. The disease often escapes the attention of pediatricians which results in scantiness of information about the incidence rate of Q fever in childhood. The purpose of this study was to establish the Q fever incidence among children in the Plovdiv region and the disease's medical and social significance. 1706 children aged 0-14 years, hospitalized for pneumonia, were subjected to a double serological investigation by means of the complement fixation test against the antigen of C. burnetii. A Q fever pneumonia was found in 16 children (0.89%) with a mean age of 10.5 years. 75% of the children were 10-14 years old, and this age group is considered to be a risk group. The ration of boy to girls was 1.7:1. 62.50% of the children came from rural areas which constitutes the population area risk group. We interpret the possible modes of infection - direct and indirect contact with animals, and consumption of raw goat's and cow's milk. Because contraction of the disease can be realised through indirect routes and the source of infection is not always so easily identifiable tests for detecting antibodies against C. burnetii antigen should be used in children with non-bacterial pneumonia. This is necessary for the pediatric practice.
