Amphotericin B treatment of fungemia due to unusual pathogens in neutropenic patients: report of two cases. Invasive fungal infections occur frequently in neutropenic patients although only in recent years has the role of emerging fungi been clearly established. We describe two cases of fungemia caused by Trichosporon beigelii and Rhodotorula glutinis respectively in two neutropenic patients with hematological malignancies who were treated with amphotericin B. The first patient, with refractory multiple myeloma, died following massive pneumonia despite therapy with amphotericin B and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) the second patient, with relapsed acute lymphatic leukemia and persistent fever without any other clinical evidence, finally recovered. Amphotericin B continues to be considered the "gold standard" in the treatment of invasive mycoses although other approaches need to be tested for refractory infections.
