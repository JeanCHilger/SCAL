Evaluation of an algorithm for integrated management of childhood illness in an area of Kenya with high malaria transmission. In 1993, the World Health Organization completed the development of a draft algorithm for the integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI), which deals with acute respiratory infections, diarrhoea, malaria, measles, ear infections, malnutrition, and immunization status. The present study compares the performance of a minimally trained health worker to make a correct diagnosis using the draft IMCI algorithm with that of a fully trained paediatrician who had laboratory and radiological support. During the 14-month study period, 1795 children aged between 2 months and 5 years were enrolled from the outpatient paediatric clinic of Siaya District Hospital in western Kenya 48% were female and the median age was 13 months. Fever, cough and diarrhoea were the most common chief complaints presented by 907 (51%), 395 (22%), and 199 (11%) of the children, respectivelyThe World Health Organization (WHO) in 1993 developed the integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) draft algorithm which offers guidelines upon the diagnosis and treatment of acute respiratory infections, diarrhea, malaria, measles, ear infections, and malnutrition, as well as immunization status.  During a 14-month study period, 1795 children aged 2 months to 5 years were enrolled in the study from the outpatient pediatric clinic of Siaya District Hospital in western Kenya, of whom 52% were male and the median age was 13 months.  51% of the children complained of having fever, 22% of having a cough, and 11% of having diarrhea.  86% of the main complaints were directly addressed by the IMCI algorithm.  1210 children had Plasmodium falciparum infection and 1432 met the WHO definition for anemia.  The sensitivities and specificities for classification of illness by a minimally trained health worker using the IMCI algorithm compared to diagnosis by the physician were: pneumonia, 97% sensitivity and 49% specificity dehydration in children with diarrhea, 51% and 98%, respectively
