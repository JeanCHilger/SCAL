Pulmonary complications in patients with haematological malignancies treated at a respiratory ICU. Patients with haematological malignancies developing severe pulmonary complications have a poor outcome, especially after bone-marrow transplantation (BMT). We studied the aetiology, the yield of different diagnostic tools, as well as the outcome and prognostic factors in the corresponding population admitted to our respiratory intensive care unit (RICU). Overall, 89 patients with haematological malignancies and pulmonary complications treated within a 10 yr period were included. The underlying malignancies were predominantly acute leukaemia and chronic myeloid leukaemia (66/89, 74%). Fifty-two of 89 (58%) patients were bone marrow recipients. An aetiological diagnosis could be obtained in 61/89 (69%) of cases. The aetiology was infectious in 37/89 (42%) and noninfectious in 24/89 (27%). Blood cultures and cytological examinations of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were the diagnostic tools with the highest yield (13/43 (30%) and 13/45 (29%) positive results, respectively). Necropsy results were coincident with results obtained during the lifetime in 43% of cases with infectious and 60% with noninfectious aetiologies. Overall mortality was 70/89 (79%), and 47/52 (90%) in transplant recipients. The requirement of mechanical ventilation, BMT, and an interval <90 days of BMT prior to ICU admission were independent adverse prognostic factors. The outcome in this patient population was uniformly poor. It was worst in bone marrow recipients developing pulmonary complications <90 days after transplantation and requiring mechanical ventilation. Decisions about intensive care unit admission and mech-anical ventilation should seriously consider the dismal prognosis of these patients.
