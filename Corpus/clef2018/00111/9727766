Chronic anaerobic pneumonitis in a seven-year-old girl. A 7-year-old girl was referred for evaluation of chronic pulmonary disease associated with nasal symptoms of 4 years duration for which she had received frequent courses of antibiotics. Serial chest roentgenograms over a period of 2 years revealed a nonhomogeneous opacity in the right lower lung zone for which she had received 18 months of antituberculous therapy without relief. Evaluation of the patient led to the diagnosis of chronic anaerobic pneumonitis, a rare clinical entity in children. In addition, the patient also had bronchial asthma and chronic rhinitis. Therapy with oral phenoxymethylpenicillin and metronidazole for 6 weeks along with appropriate antiasthma medications abolished her symptoms and resulted in roentgenologic clearance.
