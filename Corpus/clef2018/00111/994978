Pericarditis during infection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae. A 37-year-old woman was found to have pericarditis during the course of a Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection which also produced primary atypical pneumonia. Intrafamily spread of the infection was observed, with varying clinical manifestations. The case is described because there appears to be little information on mycoplasma pericarditis.
