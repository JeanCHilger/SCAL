Haemophilus influenzae type b invasive disease in Catalonia (1996). The purpose of this study was to find out the incidence and characteristics of H. influenzae type b invasive disease (HibID) in Catalonia, Spain.An active surveillance of H. influenzae isolated from normally sterile sites was carried out during 1996. Microbiology laboratories of hospitals of Catalonia were periodically contacted by telephone. The serotype of all the strains was studied.The incidence of H. influenzae invasive disease (HIID) was 7.1 per 100,000 in children under 5 years and 1.0 per 100,000 in those over 5 years. The incidence of serotype b was 6.4 per 100,000 children under 5 years and 0.2 above this age. Only three strains belonged to types other than b (d, e and f).The incidence of HIbID is uncommon in Catalonia, lower than that registered in the prevaccine era in other countries and regions of the same geographical area.
