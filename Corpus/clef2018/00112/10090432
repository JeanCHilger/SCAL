Safety profile of sparfloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone antibiotic. The safety profile of sparfloxacin, a newer fluoroquinolone antibiotic, was examined through an integrated analysis of safety data from 6 multicenter phase III trials. These consisted of 5 double-masked, randomized, comparative trials of sparfloxacin (a 400-mg oral loading dose followed by 200 mg/d for 10 days) versus standard therapies (erythromycin, cefaclor, ofloxacin, clarithromycin, and ciprofloxacin) and I open-label trial (noncomparative) in patients with: community-acquired pneumonia (2 trials) acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (1 trial)
