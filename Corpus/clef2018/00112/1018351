Hydrocarbon ingestion in children: a six-year retrospective study. The results of a six-year retrospective study of 116 children admitted with the diagnosis of hydrocarbon ingestion showed that the major toxicity of hydrocarbons was to the respiratory tract, with 79 patients (68%) developing pneumonia. There was a significantly higher initial white blood cell count in children who developed pneumonia (15,900/cu mm vs 12,000/cu mm, p less than .001). All hydrocarbon products studied had a similar incidence of complicatons, except turpentine products, which had a significantly lower incidence of pneumonia (p less than .005). There was no correlation between amount ingested and development of complicatons. Initial treatment, which consisted of induced vomiting, gastric lavage, administration of oil or saline cathartics, was not associated with fewer complications. Oil administration correlated with higher incidence of pneumonia (p less than .025). The present study recomends only supportive treatment following hydrocarbon ingestion in children.
