Intrapulmonary protein leakage in immunocompromised children and adults with pneumonia. Pulmonary infections are associated with an increase in capillary permeability but information regarding age related differences in the local inflammatory response is lacking. To quantify the degree of capillary leakage during inflammation, the concentrations of the plasma proteins albumin, alpha1-antitrypsin, alpha2-macroglobulin and the locally produced proteins elastase, myeloperoxidase, lactoferrin and fibronectin were studied in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of immunosuppressed children and adults with pneumonia.Sixteen children aged 2-16 years and 15 adults who developed pneumonia while receiving immunosuppressive therapy for haematological malignancies were included in the study. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed via a flexible bronchoscope with three aliquots of 1 ml/kg body weight in children and 200 ml in adults. Protein concentrations in BAL fluid were determined using highly sensitive immunoluminometric assays.Despite considerable variability, the median concentrations of all proteins in BAL fluid were significantly higher in both patient populations than in previously collected age adjusted reference values. The concentrations of serum derived proteins were significantly higher in children with pneumonia than in adult patients. In contrast, no differences were observed between the two groups for locally produced proteins.These data suggest that the degree of protein exudation is more pronounced in immunosuppressed children with pneumonia than in adults in a similar clinical situation. This is in agreement with our studies in healthy individuals and may reflect a greater permeability of the alveolar-capillary membrane in children, regardless of disease status.
