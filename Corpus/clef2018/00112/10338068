Perinatally acquired Chlamydia trachomatis associated morbidity in young infants. This study was designed to evaluate the spectrum of morbidity associated with perinatally acquired Chlamydia trachomatis in infants < or =12 weeks of age, and to determine its relationship to maternal Chlamydia trachomatis status.Retrospective review of maternal and infant records.Large inner city teaching hospital.A cohort of 530 symptomatic infants < or =12 weeks of age who were tested for Chlamydia trachomatis infection in the upper respiratory tract during a 2-year period from January 1993 to December 1994.During the study period, 70/530 (13.2%) patients tested positive for Chlamydia trachomatis from the conjunctiva and/or the nasopharynx. Complete medical records of 66 of these infants were available for review. Forty-eight of 66 (73%) infants had conjunctivitis, 13/66 (20%) had pneumonia, 5/66 (7%) had both conjunctivitis and pneumonia. Thirteen of 66 (20%) infants were hospitalized, 7 for pneumonia and 6 for ophthalmia, accounting for 68 hospital days. In 55/66 (83%), maternal records were available for review. Nineteen of 55 (35%) mothers had documented Chlamydia trachomatis infection at delivery or during pregnancy that had not been treated 16/55 (29%) mothers tested negative for Chlamydia trachomatis sometime during pregnancy but were not retested at delivery, 8/55 (14%) were treated for Chlamydia trachomatis during pregnancy but status at delivery regarding reinfection was not evaluated. In 12/55 (22%) mothers, no prenatal testing was documented.This study demonstrates significant morbidity in early infancy associated with perinatally acquired Chlamydia trachomatis infection. There is need for studies evaluating the importance of adequate maternal testing and treatment to reduce perinatal transmission.
