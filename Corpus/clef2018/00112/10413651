Common variable immunodeficiency: clinical and immunological features of 248 patients. Common variable immunodeficiency (CVI) is a primary immunodeficiency disease characterized by reduced serum immunoglobulins and heterogeneous clinical features. In these studies we describe the clinical and immunological status of 248 consecutively referred CVI patients of age range 3-79 years who have been followed for a period of 1-25 years. The median age at the time of onset of symptoms was 23 years for males and 28 years for females the mean age at which the diagnosis of CVI was made was 29 years for males and 33 years for females.
