A randomised, multicentre study of ceftriaxone versus standard therapy in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections. In this study the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of i.v. ceftriaxone 1 g once daily (CTX) was compared with standard i.v. antibiotic treatment (STD) for lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI). STD was given according to the guidelines of the American Thoracic Society and consisted of either cefuroxime 1500 mg three times daily (q8h), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 1200 mg q8h or ceftriaxone 2 g once daily each with or without a macrolide. After a minimum of 5 days i.v. therapy, patients could be switched to oral therapy. One hundred patients were enrolled in the study
