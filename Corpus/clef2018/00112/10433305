Little benefit from mild hypothermia therapy for severely head injured patients with low intracranial pressure. This study was performed to determine whether mild hypothermia therapy is essential for the treatment of severely head injured patients in whom intracranial pressure (ICP) can be maintained below 20 mm Hg by using conventional therapies.Sixteen consecutive severely head injured patients fulfilled the following criteria: the patient's ICP was maintained below 20 mm Hg by using fluid restriction, hyperventilation, and high-dose barbiturate therapy and the patient had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 8 or less on admission. After conventional therapies had been applied, the patients were divided randomly into two groups: the mild hypothermia group (HT groupThe authors recommend normothermia therapy for the treatment of severely head injured patients in whom ICP can be maintained at lower than 20 mm Hg by using conventional therapies, because mild hypothermia therapy does not convey any advantage over normothermia therapy in such patients.
