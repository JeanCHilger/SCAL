Ozone effects on airway responsiveness, lung injury, and inflammation. Comparative rat strain and in vivo/in vitro investigations. Asthmatic individuals appear to be particularly sensitive to the effects of certain air pollutants-including ozone (O(3)), an oxidant ambient air pollutant-for reasons that are poorly understood. The general purpose of these studies, therefore, was to expand and improve upon toxicologic methods for assessing ozone-induced effects on the airways of the rat by (1) developing an in vivo testing procedure that allows detection of airway responsiveness changes in rats exposed to ozone (2) identifying a strain of rat that may be inherently more sensitive to the effects of ozone
