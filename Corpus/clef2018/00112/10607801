Comparison of systemic cytokine levels in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, severe pneumonia, and controls. The inflammatory response has been widely investigated in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pneumonia. Studies investigating the diagnostic values of serum cytokine levels have yielded conflicting results and only little information is available for the differential diagnosis between ARDS and pneumonia.Clinical and physiological data, serum concentrations of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6, and quantitative cultures of lower respiratory tract specimens were obtained from 46 patients with ARDS and 20 with severe pneumonia within 24 hours of the onset of the disease and from 10 control subjects with no inflammatory lung disease. Cytokine concentrations were compared between groups and determinants in addition to the diagnosis were tested.Serum TNF-alpha levels were significantly higher in ARDS patients (67 (57) pg/ml) than in patients with severe pneumonia (35 (20) pg/ml p = 0.031) or controls (17 (8) pg/mlSerum TNF-alpha levels were higher in patients with ARDS than in those with severe pneumonia or in control subjects. Multivariate results suggest that the levels of systemic TNF-alpha and IL-1beta reflect the severity of the lung injury rather than the diagnosis.
