Acute and chronic effects of methotrexate on hepatic, pulmonary, and skeletal systems. With the progressive improvement in the survival of children with acute lymphocytic leukemia, the question of late effects of therapy on normal tissue becomes a more significant problem. In a review of a large number of children who have received long-term treatment with chemotherapy, especially methotrexate, a significant increase in the serious effects on hepatic, pulmonary, and skeletal tissue was noted. A review of the methotrexate-induced acute and chronic changes seen in these tissues is the basis for this report.
