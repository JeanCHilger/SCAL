Infectious complications during remission induction therapy in 577 patients with acute myeloid leukemia in the Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group studies between 1987 and 1991. The Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group analyzed infectious episodes in 577 patients with acute myeloid leukemia during remission induction therapy between 1987 and 1991. 542 patients (93.9%) experienced at least one infectious episode, 121 (21.0%) had microbiologically documented infection there was clinically documented infection in 184 (31.9%) and unexplained fever in 237 (41.1%). Among 121 microbiologically documented infections, bacteremia/fungemia was observed in 68, pneumonia in 33, and other types of infections in 20. Among the bacteremia/fungemia, gram-negative bacteria accounted for 41.2% (Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common), gram-positive bacteria for 39.7%, fungi for 16.2% (Candida spp. being most frequent), and polymicrobial for 2.9%. The most frequent isolates among pneumonia were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aspergillus. A total of 70 patients (12.1%) died during remission induction. Mortality of 68 patients with bacteremia/fungemia was 26.5%
