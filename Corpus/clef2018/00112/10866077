Pulmonary disease in liver transplant recipients. Spectrum of CT features. To determine the features of pulmonary disease in liver transplant recipients by CT.Of 792 patients, 102 were referred to thoracic CT 3-2093 days after the transplantation procedure (median 107 days). All CT studies were retrospectively analyzed and correlated with clinical, microbiological, serological and histopathological findings.Eighty-eight of 102 patients (86%) had an abnormal CT. In 25 patients (25%), an elevated right hemidiaphragm, basal atelectasis and small effusions were the only abnormalities. Fourty-one patients (40%) displayed an infiltrate and 13 (13%) a mass lesion. Evidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection was found in 20 patients. CMV pneumonia was suggested by an interstitial pattern of pneumonia on CT (n=13). Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia was highlighted by peribronchovascular infiltrates (n=5/8), bacterial pneumonia (n=24) including legionellosis (n= 13) by bilateral effusions (n=14) and lobar consolidation (n= 13). In 7/41 patients (17%) with both clinically apparent pulmonary disease and CT signs of pneumonia, no pathogen could be detected. Neoplastic disease was mostly due to tumor recurrence (n=6).Thoracic CT of liver transplant recipients aids in detecting and classifying both infectious and neoplastic complications.
