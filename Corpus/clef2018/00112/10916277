A case of recurrent pneumonias. A description is given of the case of a young boy who presented with repeated episodes of pneumonias since childhood. In addition, he had episodes of intermittent diarrhoeas. His investigative work-up revealed a deficiency of serum immunoglobulins, that is, hypogammaglobulinaemia. The profile was suggestive of common variable immunodeficiency. Because of the relative rarity of this disease, it is often missed leading to significant morbidity. Treatment consists of immunoglobulin replacement therapy and management of recurrent infections with appropriate drugs.
