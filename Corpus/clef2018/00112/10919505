Respiratory infections and asthma. Clinical and experimental evidence suggests an important role for respiratory infections in the development of asthma attacks. Viral upper respiratory infections have been associated with 80% of asthma exacerbations in children and 50% of all asthma episodes in adults. Human rhinovirus has been implicated as the principal virus associated with asthma episodes. Separate studies indicate that atypical bacteria such as Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae may precipitate asthma symptoms. Although not completely clarified, the intricate pathogenetic mechanisms by which viral infections promote asthma attacks have been extensively investigated in recent years. By contrast, it has not yet been established whether atypical bacterial infections are an epiphenomenon or a pathogenic event in asthma.
