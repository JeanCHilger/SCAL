Mortality and prognostic factors in patients with community-acquired pneumonia: an analysis of 231 cases. We prospectively analyzed the mortality and prognostic factors in 231 patients with community-acquired pneumonia. The patients were enrolled between May 1996 and April 1998. The average patient age was 67.6 +/- 17.5 years, and 68% were male. The mean hospital length of stay was 21.9 +/- 21.7 days. The mortality was 6.5% at the 30th day, 13.9% at hospital discharge, and 19.9% at 1 year later. Stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that liver cirrhosis, diastolic hypotension (< 60 mmHg), hypoxemia (< 50 Torr) were significantly correlated with death at the 30th day, and that alcoholism, malignancy, diastolic hypotension, hypoxemia, hypoalbuminemia (< 3.0 g/dl), and increased creatinine (> 1.2 mg/dl) were significantly correlated with discharge mortality. Furthermore, the prognostic factors at 1 year later were the same as those at hospital discharge, with the exception of alcoholism, which was replaced by ischemic heart disease in the 1-year mortality. We conclude that liver cirrhosis, diastolic hypotension, and hypoxemia are very important prognostic factors during the acute stage of pneumonia, and that alcoholism, malignancy, hypoalbuminemia and renal complications are significantly correlated with hospital death and 1-year mortality.
