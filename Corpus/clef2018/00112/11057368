Spectrum of pneumotropic pathogens in pediatric patients with acute bronchitis and pneumonia. One hundred eighty nine children with acute bronchopulmonary infectious pathological processes were examined bacteriologically and serologically for typical pneumotropic pathogens, 47 of them being as well examined for atypical organisms. Microbial associations mainly with Mycoplasma and Pneumocystis and to a lesser extent with Chlamydia were isolated from the majority of the children. Reactivation of the cytomegalovirus infection was observed in 25 per cent of the children. Pneumonia and bronchitis due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae either as a monoagent or in associations were mainly stated in children over 7 years of age. No significant changes between the indices of the infection due to a definite organism and the active progression of the infectious process of the same etiology were revealed, though in the cases of chlamydiosis the changes reached almost 10 per cent. In cases of acute bronchitis and pneumonia the chlamydial or cytomegalovirus infection could be assumed to be of the persisting nature, mainly acute in cases of pneumococcal infection, mixed in cases of hemophilic or pneumocystic infection, primary contamination with a tendency to prolonged in cases of mycoplasmic infection. The findings of the examination and the clinical and anamnestic data showed that the clinical picture of acute pneumonia had specific features associated with the supposed etiological agents, still it could change under the action of associations of pneumotropic pathogens.
