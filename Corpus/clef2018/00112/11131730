Measles infection in HIV-infected African infants. Measles infection remains a serious threat to child survival in the developing world despite vaccination and treatment with vitamin A. This report reviews the epidemiology of measles in HIV-infected children in Africa. In hospitalized infants, the rate of malnutrition before measles and the rate of death after measles are both higher in HIV-positive than in HIV-negative infants. However, the rates of pneumonia and diarrhea in infants hospitalized with measles are the same in HIV-positive as in HIV-negative infants. In an autopsy study, measles was associated with death in HIV-positive children, only for those over 15 months of age. A cohort study found that infants of HIV-positive women were more likely than infants of HIV-negative women to have measles before 9 months of age, although the rates of complications did not differ between the two groups. The HIV status of the infants and the measles serology were too incomplete to draw firm conclusions, though only 1 of 54 infants tested was seropositive for measles at 6 months of age. In the context of the HIV epidemic, further work is needed to determine the risk of measles and its complications in HIV-positive infants and the optimal age of measles immunization.
