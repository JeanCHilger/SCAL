Prospective study of 221 community acquired pneumonias followed up in an outpatient clinic. Etiology and clinical-radiological progression. All the community acquired pneumonia followed up in an outpatient clinic were prospectively studied in order to determine: etiology, clinical-radiological characteristics and its progression with diagnostic and therapeutic protocols.We arranged clinical evaluation protocols, etiological diagnosis by means of serology (in the first visit and three weeks later) and when necessary, by means of fiberbronchoscopy (protected microbiological brush), as well as clinical and radiological progression (up to three visits) after empirical treatment.Initially, 240 patients were included, of which 221 were fully followed up. Etiological diagnosis was obtained in 86 patients (39%). The bacteria most frequently isolated was Coxiella burnetii (12.2%), followed up Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila. Two cases of Strepcococus pneumoniae were diagnosed. The most frequent radiological onset was alveolar infiltrate (86%). The initial empiric treatment were macrolids (71%) or second generation cephalosporines (22%). Most patients presented a favourable clinical and radiological progression. Only 2 patients needed admission to the hospital (< 1%).In community acquired pneumonias studied in our outpatient clinic we found a high number of "atypical" agents. Treatment with macrolids or second generation cephalosporines are appropriate for these patients.
