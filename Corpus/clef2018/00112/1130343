Pneumatoceles following hydrocarbon ingestion. Report of three cases and review of the literature. Three cases of pneumatocele formation secondary to hydrocarbon ingestion are reported and analyzed along with 12 from the literature. The cases display a spectrum of clinical severity. After a period of 3 to 15 days, during which most patients became asymptomatic, pneumatoceles were noted radiologically, usually as an unexpected finding on follow-up roentgenograms. No instances of pneumothorax or empyema were noted. Resolution has been observed radiologically after periods varying from 15 days to 21 months. The incidence of this complication is probably greater than previously realized.
