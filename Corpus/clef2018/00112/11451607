Minor [correction of Mi1nor] burns and pneumatocoeles: a case report. Minor burns in children need to be cautiously managed as they may manifest with life threatening complications especially in the presence of staphylococcal infection. A one and a half year old child with minor burns (12% TBSA), who developed large pneumatocoeles and peumomediastinum following Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia causing severe respiratory distress and needing ventilatory support is presented. Most of the pneumatocoeles were spontaneously absorbed over a period of 10 days while surgical interference was being contemplated. A conservative approach to pneumatocoeles as in non-burn patients may help prevent unnecessary surgery. An extensive English literature search (since 1966) did not reveal any report of pneumatocoeles in association with burns and therefore we believe this to be the first report of its kind.
