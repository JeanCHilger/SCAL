Congenital pneumonia in fetuses and newborns ad inflammatory lesions in the placenta. The authors compared the degree of congenital pneumonia in stillborn and neonates died in first two days of life with inflammation lesions of placenta. The coexistence of those two processes and its significant correlation was found, especially among preterm LBW neonates. This finding supports the hypothesis about infection as a probable cause not only of preterm deliveries but infection of fetuses and neonates as well. Analysis of some cases revealed also that general infection of mother could cause transplacental infection of foetuses.
