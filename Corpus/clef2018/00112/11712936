Morbidity and mortality in breastfed and formula-fed infants of HIV-1-infected women: A randomized clinical trial. Breastfeeding among women infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is associated with substantial risk of HIV-1 transmission, but little is known about the morbidity risks associated with formula feeding in infants of HIV-1-infected women in resource-poor settings.To compare morbidity, nutritional status, mortality adjusted for HIV-1 status, and cause of death among formula-fed and breastfed infants of HIV-1-infected women.Randomized clinical trial conducted between 1992 and 1998.Four antenatal clinics in Nairobi, Kenya.Of 401 live-born, singleton, or first-born twin infants of randomized HIV-1-seropositive mothers, 371 were included in the analysis of morbidity and mortality.Mothers were randomly assigned either to use formula (n = 186) or to breastfeed (n = 185) their infants.Mortality rates, adjusted for HIV-1 infection status morbidityTwo-year estimated mortality rates among infants were similar in the formula-feeding and breastfeeding arms (20.0% vs 24.4% hazard ratio [HR], 0.8In this randomized clinical trial, infants assigned to be formula fed or breastfed had similar mortality rates and incidence of diarrhea and pneumonia during the first 2 years of life. However, HIV-1-free survival at 2 years was significantly higher in the formula arm. With appropriate education and access to clean water, formula feeding can be a safe alternative to breastfeeding for infants of HIV-1-infected mothers in a resource-poor setting.
