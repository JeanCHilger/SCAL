Post-infectious central and peripheral nervous system diseases complicating Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. Report of three cases and review of the literature. Three patients with a central and peripheral nervous system disease complicating a Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pn.) infection are presented. Patient 1 suffered from bilateral optic neuritis as well as acute Guillain-Barr√© syndrome recovering after plasmapheresis. The two other patients suffered from severe haemorrhagic leukoencephalitis (Hurst) which only could be contained by aggressive decompressive craniectomy with duraplasty. All three illnesses were clearly shown to be associated with M. pn. infection. Our three patients represent the full scale of central nervous (CNS) (cerebral and myelitic) as well as peripheral nervous system (PNS) (GBS, optic neuritis) manifestation of a disease caused by the same pathogenetic - post-infectious - mechanism pathogenic CNS and PNS epitopes might be shared in post-infectious neurological disease following M. pn. infection.
