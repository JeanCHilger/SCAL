Calcitonin gene related peptide in familial dysautonomia. Familial dysautonomia (FD) patients have diminished sensory C-fibers. Calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) is a widely distributed neuropeptide and prominent neurotransmitter in C-fibers. We show that plasma CGRP levels measured by radioimmunoassay is significantly lower in 51 FD patients compared to controls (P<0.001). In 11/51 FD patients with FD crisis and in 19/51 FD patients with pneumonia, the mean CGRP levels rose significantly as compared to their baseline (P<0.003, P<0.001, respectively). The deficiency of CGRP in FD patients is consistent with their depletion of C-fibers, and may explain some of their symptoms, either directly or via modulation of sympathetic activity.
