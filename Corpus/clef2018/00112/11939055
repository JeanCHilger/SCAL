Effect of selenium on children suffered from Mycoplasma pneumonia. In order to evaluate the therapeutic effects of Selenium (Se) on Mycoplasma pneumonia, a clinical study was conducted in hospitalized patients using a double blind controlled method. The patients were randomly divided into two groups, the control patients received the routine treatment, and the supplemented group was given 1 mg sodium selenite one time only in addition to the routine treatment. The present study showed that concomitant of Se and routine treatment was superior to routine treatment alone in terms of improvement of clinical signs, time needed for relieving symptoms and signs (P < 0.05). The levels of Se and glutathione peroxidase in plasma and white blood cell were increased in Se supplemented group (P < 0.05). Higher proportion of patients in the treated group showed normalization of T cell subset parameters as compared with the control group. It can be concluded that supplementation of Se would be conducive to the improvement of the nutritional status and the increase of the ability of resisting-infection.
