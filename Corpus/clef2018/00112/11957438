Extrapulmonary complications of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common cause of atypical pneumonia in children and young adults. The infection is generally mild and only a very few patients are admitted to hospital. However, extrapulmonary complications are well recognised--mostly as manifestations from the central nervous system (CNS).We describe 21 patients with M. pneumoniae infection seen at Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, from 1994 to 2000.The patients had fever, headache, myalgia, and cough. Biochemically, they were characterised by leucocytosis, an increased level of C-reactive protein, and infiltrations on the chest x-ray. A total of seven patients developed extrapulmonary complications to the infection in the form of encephalitis (3), polyradiculitis (1), transversel myelitis (1), erythema multiforme (3), cardial arrhythmia (1), and haemolytic anaemia (2). Three patients had more than one complication at the same time.The incidence of patients with complications to M. pneumoniae infection was higher than that reported in the literature, probably because these patients are typically submitted to the Department of Infectious Diseases, Rigshospitalet. The pathogenesis of extrapulmonary complications to M. pneumoniae infection is unknown.
