Diagnostic value of different laboratory methods in the diagnosis of pneumonia caused by Haemophilus influenzae type B. Comparative analysis of the diagnostic value of different laboratory methods in the diagnosis of H. influenzae b (Hib) pneumonia in children (bacteriological method, latex agglutination, counter immunoelectrophoresis, the passive hemagglutination test and the enzyme immunoassay (EIA) was carried out. EIA proved to be the most informative method for the diagnosing Hib pneumonia. EIA makes it possible to detect specific Hib antigens in different clinical materials in 48.8% of cases, as well as high titers of antibodies to mis infective agent in 61.7% of cases. The authors propose the unified criteria of the laboratory diagnosis of Hib infection in children.
