Q-Fever and its complications (author's transl). Q-Fever recurs as localized epidemics in the German Federal Republic. The disease has not previously been observed in North Hesse. During a familial infection with Coxiella burneti a 15-year-old boy together with his parents and an aunt became ill with atypical pneumonia. After the pulmonary symptoms had subsided a deep left leg and pelvic venous thrombosis occurred in the boy in the fifth week after the onset of the disease. The thrombosis which is very rare in childhood could be successfully removed at operation.
