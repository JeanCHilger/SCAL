Duodenal ulcer associated complications were the commonest with duodenal ulcer/gastric ulcer ratio of 11.5:1. Most patients had chronic peptic ulcer symptoms with inadequate or no medical treatment. Perforations were the commonest complications (56.6%) followed by gastric outlet obstruction (34.0%). Closure with omental patch was done in 83.3% of perforations while truncal vagotomy and drainage was done in gastric outlet obstruction. Hypostatic pneumonia was the commonest post-operative complication. Seventy one point seven per cent of the patients were free of dyspeptic symptoms during the brief follow-up period.Most patients with chronic peptic ulcers had had inadequate treatment and perforation was the most common complication.
