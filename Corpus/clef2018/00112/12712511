Persistence of pneumotrophic infective agents in acute bronchopulmonary diseases in children. 175 children with acute bronchopulmonary pathology were examined for the presence of the pneumotropic infective agents by serological and bacteriological methods. In most children microbial associations with the prevalence of mycoplasmas, pneumocycts and, to a lesser extent, chlamydiae were detected. The considerable activation of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in children with pneumonia and bronchitis was noted. Taking into account the results of the examination and the clinico-anamnestic data, the character of infections could be established: chlamydial and CMV infections were mainly persisting pneumococcal infection was mainly acute, hemophilic and pneumocyst infections were mixed. The clinical picture of acute pneumonia cases had characteristic features determined by the supposed etiological agent, but this picture could change under the influence of pneumotropic infective agents.
