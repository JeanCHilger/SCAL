Adenovirus types 11 and 21: genome types and clinic features. DNA restriction endonuclease analysis was made on 26 adenovirus types 11 and 21 (Adv 11, Adv 21)--uncommon adenovirus causing infantile pneumonia with the enzymes BamHI and HindIII in Changchun area from 1975 to 1982. Adv 11 and Adv 21 represented the two new genome types during their prevalence for 8 years, i.e. D2 (11), D3(11), D2(21) and D3(21). The decisive factors of viral virulence and pathogenicity were analysed by comparison of the clinical features of pneumonia caused by different types Adv. The study of DNA structures revealed the similarities and differences in the clinical features of the disease caused by the serotypes and genome types Adv.
