Interferon production during the course of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. In patients infected with Mycoplasma pneumoniae the development of interferon (IFN) was studied in nasopharyngeal secretions and sera. The production of IFN-gamma by lymphocytes was also investigated in response to M. pneumoniae antigen and mumps virus antigen. IFN-alpha was detected in 25 (61.0%) of 41 nasopharyngeal secretion samples and in 25 (59.5%) of 42 serum samples within 6 days after the onset of illness. IFN-alpha was significantly higher in nasopharyngeal secretions than in sera and a significant correlation was observed between the two. In most of the patients lymphocytes produced a larger amount of IFN-gamma in the convalescent stage than in the acute stage, when lymphocytes were stimulated with M. pneumoniae antigen. In some patients, however, lymphocytes did not produce IFN-gamma during the course of illness. Such lymphocytes, negative for IFN-gamma production in response to M. pneumoniae, produced IFN-gamma after the depletion of macrophages, and readdition of macrophages suppressed the production of IFN-gamma by lymphocytes. When lymphocytes were stimulated with heterogeneous antigen (mumps virus), they produced no IFN or a small amount of IFN in the acute stage of M. pneumoniae infection, and IFN production increased in the convalescent stage. Different mechanisms seem to work for homogeneous and heterogeneous antigens in the suppression of IFN production in M. pneumoniae infection.
