Adiponecrosis subcutanea neonatorum in congenital pneumonia. In the course of a connatal pneumonia, a 7-day-old female newborn developed symmetrical subcutaneous nodules on her back, shoulders, and upper arms. These skin lesions were accompanied by hypercalcemia. Histological examination confirmed the putative clinical diagnosis of subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn. We discuss the differential diagnoses, therapeutic strategies, and prognosis of this uncommon disorder of the fat tissue.
