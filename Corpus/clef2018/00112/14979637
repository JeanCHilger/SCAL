Evaluation of blood serum, erythrocyte and urine magnesium concentrations in babies with pneumonia or bronchial obstructive bronchitis. Physiological properties of magnesium (Mg) as a catalyst of enzymatic processes mainly are known quite well. Still unclear, however, are the changes in its concentrations in the body that occur in the course of many diseases, among others in babies with bronchial obstructive bronchitis and pneumonia. Therefore research was undertaken to determine the concentrations of magnesium in blood serum, erythrocytes and urine in babies suffering from pneumonia (54 babies) and bronchial obstructive bronchitis (46 babies). The results found that magnesium concentrations in the blood serum, erythrocytes and urine differ significantly in the groups of sick and healthy babies. Compared to the control group significantly lowest Mg concentrations in the blood serum, erythrocytes and highest in the urine were found both before and after the treatment in the babies suffering from bronchial obstructive bronchitis.
