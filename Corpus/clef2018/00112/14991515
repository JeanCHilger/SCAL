Value of washed sputum gram stain smear and culture for management of lower respiratory tract infections in children. To date, the technique of washed sputum examinations has not been widely used in the clinical management of lower respiratory tract infections in children. A total of 224 sputum samples from 125 pediatric patients with lower respiratory tract infections were collected for washed sputum Gram stain smears and cultures. The results with these methods were compared to find correlation rates. The value of washed sputum cultures was assessed by examining the clinical responses of the patients who received antibiotic therapies instituted on the basis of the sputum culture results. Isolation rates of Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus were 22.4%, 9.4%, 4.9%, and 0.4%, respectively. For the prediction of H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, and M. catarrhalis, the sensitivities of the washed sputum Gram stain smears compared with the culture method were 86.0%, 81.0%, and 90.9%, respectively. The specificities of the washed sputum Gram stain smear technique were 94.8%, 97.5%, and 98.1%, respectively. Overall, the sensitivity and specificity of the washed sputum Gram stain smear method were 85.5% and 87.2%, respectively. S. aureus was isolated from only one specimen and washed sputum Gram stain smear estimation was correlated with the culture result. On the basis of the washed sputum culture results, appropriate antibiotic therapies were instituted for 93.3% of the patients with acute lower respiratory tract infections. This study suggests that the techniques of washed sputum Gram stain smear and culture are valuable and should be encouraged in clinical practice for the management of lower respiratory tract infections in children.
