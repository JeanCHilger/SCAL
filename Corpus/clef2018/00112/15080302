The involvement of natural killer cells in the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome. By using peripheral blood samples from 221 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), 34 of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection, and 44 healthy adults, we measured the total number of natural killer (NK) and CD158b+ NK cells (CD158b+ NK) using flow cytometric analysis and calculated the percentage of CD158b+ NK cells. The total number of NK and CD158b+ NK cells and the percentage of CD158b+ NK cells were significantly lower in patients with SARS than in those with M. pneumoniae infection (P < .05 for all) and healthy subjects (P < .01, P < .01, P < .05, respectively) in 72 patients with severe SARS than in 149 with mild SARS (P < .05 for all)
