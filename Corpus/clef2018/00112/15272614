Etiology and bronchofiberscopic treatment of pulmonary atelectasis in patients with severe motor and intellectual disabilities. Atelectasis is a common respiratory complication in patients with severe motor and intellectual disabilities. We encountered 3 patients with irreversible atelectasis due to delayed therapy, emphasizing the necessity of performing flexible bronchofiberscopy. A total of 21 patients with atelectasis were studied to assess the etiology and efficacy of bronchofiberscopy. The underlying condition was bronchitis/pneumonia in 19 cases, tracheal hemorrhage in 1, and lung cancer in 1. Most of the patients had predisposing factors, such as a bedridden status in 90% and a weak or absent cough reflex in 81%. It was statistically suggested that atelectasis is likely to occur on the side contralateral to thoracic scoliosis. Among the 18 patients who underwent bronchofiberscopy within 2 weeks after the diagnosis of atelectasis, 16 (89%) showed recanalization and resultant improvement of respiratory failure. Bronchofiberscopy is useful for treating atelectasis in patients with severe motor and intellectual disabilities.
