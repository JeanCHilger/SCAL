Immunoserodiagnosis of acute Streptococcus pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae infections in the period of epidemic rise of non-hospital pneumonia in children in St. Petersburg, 1998-2001. The dynamics of the antibody formation to S. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae in children during the epidemic outbreak of non-hospital pneumonia in St. Petersburg in 1998-2001 was studied. For the first time the inhibiting influence of acute C. pneumoniae infection on the synthesis of antibodies to S. pneumoniae in acute mixed infection was established. The prolonged (up to days 29-39 of the disease) circulation of IgM and IgG antibodies in acute chlamydial infection, as well as the prevalence of the primary infectious process, were detected.
