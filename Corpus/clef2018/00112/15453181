Patterns of hospital-based pediatric care across diverse ethnicities: the case of pneumonia. Few studies have evaluated racial disparities with respect to process and outcome measures for pneumonia. We evaluated disparities with respect to process measures in addition to clinical and financial outcome measures in a pediatric population from 0 to 18 years of age. The data showed that minority populations were admitted at younger ages and were more likely to be admitted through the emergency department than their white counterparts. Substantial variation exists with respect to patterns of care and outcomes for pneumonia in pediatric patients among different ethnic/racial groups. Differences in outcomes may be associated with several factors, including variations in quality of care across different hospital settings, characteristics related to disease severity among different ethnic groups, and other unidentified factors. Further research is needed to clearly define how differences with respect to quality of care, access to care, disease severity, and care-seeking behaviors contribute to differences in outcomes across different ethnic groups.
