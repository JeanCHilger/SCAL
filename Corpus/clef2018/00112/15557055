Pulmonary and systemic bacterial co-infections in severe RSV bronchiolitis. In 127 infants admitted to intensive care for RSV bronchiolitis, concomitant bacterial sepsis was a rare event. However, in the subgroup of intubated patients the incidence of bacterial pneumonia was 43.9% (95% CI 31.0-56.8%), half community acquired and half nosocomial. As clinical signs are not helpful in identifying these patients, tracheal aspirates have to be investigated microbiologically on a routine basis in order to start antibiotics in time.
