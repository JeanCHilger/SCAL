Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in Yemen: incidence, presentation and antibiotic susceptibility. To determine the incidence, clinical presentation and antibiotic susceptibility of Mycoplasma pneumoniae at the main hospitals in Sana'a, we studied 405 patients clinically and radiographically diagnosed with lower respiratory tract infections aged 10-60 years. M. pneumoniae was identified by 3 different methods: culture, antigen detection and IgM serology. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed for confirmed isolates by macro-broth dilution technique. There were 125 patients (30.9%) with current infection, mostly among younger age groups, with bronchopneumonia the most common underlying clinical condition. All tested isolates were susceptible to all antibiotics in the in vitro antibiogram, with erythromycin the most active. The results indicate the need for different approaches in the diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection in Yemen.
