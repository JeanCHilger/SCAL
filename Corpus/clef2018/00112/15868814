Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection associated with hemolytic anemia--report of one case. Immune hemolytic anemia is a rare condition in childhood. Cold agglutinins have been implicated in the etiology of the hemolysis. However, cold agglutinins may occur in various infections, such as mycoplasma pneumoniae and infectious mononucleosis. In children, especially of preschool age, mycoplasma pneumoniae very commonly cause respiratory tract infection, but inducing an immune hemolytic anemia is exceptional. We present here a case of cold agglutinin-related severe hemolytic anemia (Hb = 3.8 gm/dl) secondary to mycoplasma pneumoniae infection who recovered completely after blood transfusion, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and medical treatment with erythromycin. It is suggested that even though very rare, mycoplasma pneumoniae may induce the occurrence of cold agglutinins and cause immune hemolytic anemia.
