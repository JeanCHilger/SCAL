Transient protein-losing hypertrophic gastropathy associated with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in childhood. A 3-year-old boy with transient protein loss due to hypertrophic gastropathy is described. Serologic evidence of concomitant Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was present. Although sometimes associated with infections, protein-losing hypertrophic gastropathy has not been reported previously in association with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection.
