Routine otorhinolaryngological examination in patients with cystic fibrosis. Data on the prevalence of otorhinolaryngological (ORL) symptoms in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are limited. A standard annual examination would be useful for definition of risk factors and/or management alternatives for these symptoms.Prospective observational study of an unselected group of CF patients.Between 1997 and 2004, 123 CF patients were routinely examined. The examinations included nasal endoscopy and audiological evaluation.All patients who were approached to take part in the study gave their consent and were extremely cooperative. In 40% of the patients nasal polyps were found endoscopically. In 22% rhinological surgery had already been performed. Of the 123 patients, 13 (12%) showed different grades of sensorineural hearing loss, and all of these patients had received aminoglycoside antibiotics.CF patients demonstrate a high prevalence of ORL symptoms. Therefore, an annual standard examination would provide data for identifying potential risk factors and for optimizing the management of these symptoms in CF patients.
