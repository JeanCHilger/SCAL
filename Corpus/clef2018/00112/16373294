Increase of interleukin-6 in tracheal aspirate at birth: a predictor of subsequent bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants. We tested whether interleukin-6 (IL-6) in tracheal aspirate (TA) at birth, as a marker of fetal pulmonary inflammation, can be a predictor of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants.A total of 75 preterm (< or = 32 wk) infants who were intubated in the delivery room were prospectively enrolled. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was done to determine whether IL-6 in TA at birth is an independent risk factor for BPD, and a receiver-operating characteristic curve was constructed to determine the accuracy of IL-6 in TA for predicting the risk of BPD.IL-6 in TA at birth was an independent risk factor for BPD. Fetal pulmonary inflammation defined as IL-6 in TA at birth > or = 316 pg/ml together with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) additively predicted the risk of BPD. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of fetal pulmonary inflammation for the identification of BPD were 73%, 71%, 58% and 83%, respectively.IL-6 in TA at birth can be used as a predictor of BPD in combination with the presence of PDA.
