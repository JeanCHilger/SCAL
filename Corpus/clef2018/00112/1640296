Phospholipid and surfactant protein A concentrations in tracheal aspirates from infants requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. To test the hypothesis that infants with severe respiratory failure and the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are surfactant deficient, we measured the amount of surfactant phospholipids, disaturated phosphatidylcholine, surfactant protein A, and protein in tracheal aspirates from 22 infants, who received ECMO therapy for respiratory failure with meconium aspiration syndrome (n = 18) or pneumonia (n = 4). Tracheal suction material was obtained in a standardized way every 4 hours during the period of ECMO treatment and pooled for 24-hour periods. During ECMO, mean total phospholipid, disaturated phosphatidylcholine, and surfactant protein A values in tracheal aspirates increased and protein values decreased significantly, predominantly during the 72-hour period before infants were weaned from ECMO. Of the 22 infants, 14 had an increase in tracheal aspirate phospholipid values of more than 200% and were found to need a shorter period of ECMO support (p less than 0.005) and post-ECMO ventilatory support (p less than 0.025) than did the eight infants with stationary or only moderate increases in tracheal aspirate phospholipid values, three of whom had pneumonia. We conclude that infants with respiratory failure who require ECMO treatment often have surfactant deficiency. We speculate that surfactant treatment might decrease the need for or the duration of ECMO support.
