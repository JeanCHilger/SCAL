Measurement of complement receptor 1 on neutrophils in bacterial and viral pneumonia. A reliable prediction of the causative agent of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is not possible based on clinical features. Our aim was to test, whether the measurement of the expression of complement receptors or Fcgamma receptors on neutrophils and monocytes would be a useful preliminary test to differentiate between bacterial and viral pneumonia.Sixty-eight patients with CAP were studied prospectively. Thirteen patients had pneumococcal pneumonia 13 patients, influenza A pneumoniaThe mean expression of complement receptor 1 (CR1) on neutrophils was significantly higher in the patients with pneumococcal pneumonia than in those with influenza A pneumonia. The mean expression of CR1 was also significantly higher in aetiologically undefined pneumonia than in influenza A pneumonia, but there was no difference between pneumococcal and undefined pneumonia.Our results suggest that the expression of CR1 is higher in classical bacterial pneumonia than in viral pneumonia. Determination of the expression of CR1 may be of value as an additional rapid tool in the aetiological diagnosis, bacterial or viral infection, of CAP. These results are preliminary and more research is needed to assess the utility of this new method in the diagnostics of pneumonia.
