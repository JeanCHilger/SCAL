Pulmonary infections in renal transplant recipients. Fifty-seven episodes of pulmonary infection occurred in 46 patients during a 11.5-year period, the incidence being 12% (57/475). After treatment, 22 patients recovered, and 24 died (52%). The etiology was determined in 47 infection episodes. 38(81%) of them were caused by bacteria, 6 by fungi, and 3 by tubercle bacilli. Comparisons were made between infected and noninfected groups. The results showed that the incidence of rejection episodes, greatly elevated blood sugar level (greater than or equal to 11.1 mmol/L) and granulocytopenia (less than or equal to 1.5 10(9)/L) influenced significantly the morbidity and mortality of pulmonary infection.
