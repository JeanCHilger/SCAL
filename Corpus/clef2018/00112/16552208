Clinical and economic outcomes of hospital acquired pneumonia in intra-abdominal surgery patients. To measure the clinical and economic impact of postoperative hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and to identify risk factors for the development of HAP.Although postoperative HAP is recognized to be an major risk associated with surgery, little is known about the overall outcomes of patients whose hospital stay is complicated by HAP following surgery.We studied 618,495 patients who underwent an intra-abdominal operation from the National Inpatient Sample database over a 1-year period (January 2000 to December 2000) using CPT codes and discharge diagnoses identified by the Clinical Classification Software. Data collected included demographic characteristics, type of operation, in-hospital mortality, discharge disposition, length of stay, and hospital charges.Of the 13,292 patients with HAP following intra-abdominal surgery, 1421 died prior to discharge (mortality = 10.7%) compared with 7217 deaths in the control group of patients without HAP following intra-abdominal surgery (mortality = 1.2%) (P < 0.001). HAP was independently associated with a 4.13-fold (95% confidence interval = 3.94-4.34) increase in risk to be discharged to a skilled nursing facility. The mean length of hospital stay for intra-abdominal patients who developed HAP was significantly greater compared with intra-abdominal surgery patients who did not develop HAP (17.10 days versus 6.07 days, P < 0.001). After adjusting for patient characteristics, HAP was independently associated with a 75% (28,160.95 dollars 95% confidence interval, 27,543.76 dollars - 28,778.13 dollars) mean increase in total hospital charges.Given the high incidence and significant impact of HAP on patient outcomes, early preventive strategies and interventions to reduce HAP should be a priority.
