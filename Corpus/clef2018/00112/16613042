Diagnosis and treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia in children. The purpose of the investigation was to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in children. The prevalence, etiology, and onset of VAP in a pediatric intensive care unit, and the diagnostic value the clinical pulmonary infection score scale were studied. The prevalence of VAP was found to be 37.56 per 1,000 mechanical ventilation days, and the CPIS scale was not always useful in diagnosing VAP in children. The most common causative agents of VAP were Enterobacteriaceae spp, and its major pathogen is P. aeruginosa. Early adequate antibacterial therapy prevents and treats VAP, without causing any complications.
