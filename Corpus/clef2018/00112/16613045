Experience with a selenium-containing biological active supplement used in children with pneumonias in an intensive care unit. The efficacy of the biologically active additive (BAA) "Spirulin-Sochi-Selen" was evaluated in 45 children aged 3 to 15 years who had acute pneumonia treated in the intensive care unit for infected patients of the Tushino children's city hospital, Moscow. The levels of selenium were determined by the Alfthan microfluorimetric technique (1984). The time course of clinical, laboratory, functional, and X-ray changes was determined. A control group comprised 20 children taking no selenium-containing foods or biologically active additives. The findings suggest that the BAA "Spirulin-Sochi-Selen" is effective as part of therapy for acute pneumonia in children treated in an intensive care unit. There were no signs of selenium deficiency in any case despite the baseline reduction in the average serum levels in both groups.
