Haemophilus Influenzae contributes to morbidity but not mortality in severely burned patients. Due to a successful Haemophilus Influenzae (HIF) vaccination program, this pathogen is no longer a major contributor to childhood morbidity and mortality. The effect on adult acquisition of HIF is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine HIF infection frequency in severely burned patients. In a 62-month period, there were 1486 admissions. Twenty-four of 1,486 (1.6%) burn patients had HIF pneumonia: 16 (1%) within 72 h after injury 8 (0.5%) patients developed it after the seventh day of hospitalization
