Comparison of PCR for sputum samples obtained by induced cough and serological tests for diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in children. Passive agglutination (PA) and immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgA, and IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for the diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae were compared with PCR testing of sputum samples obtained from children with lower respiratory tract infections. The sensitivity and specificity of PA were 80.3% and 92.3% at a titer of 1:80. ELISA was found to be less sensitive than PA.
