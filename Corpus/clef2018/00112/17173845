Childhood tuberculosis diagnosed and managed as asthma: case report. The worldwide incidence of tuberculosis (TB) has been increasing. Although its diagnosis is well established in adults, in children it is difficult due to its particular aspects. We report a 3 years and 8 month-old infant who experienced chronic wheezing, classified as moderate-to-severe asthma, had recurrent pneumonia, and was not responsive to management with beta adrenergic agents. Chest X-rays (CXR) showed heterogeneous condensation in medium lobe and the chest computerized-tomography scan (CCT) a heterogeneous increase in pulmonary transparency, like condensation in the same lobe. After four months of treatment with anti tuberculosis agents, a significant improvement in symptoms, normal CXR, absence of pulmonary medium lobe condensation, and persistence fibro-atelectatic band in lingula were observed.
