Evaluation of DNA-probe assay for the clinical diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections. DNA probe-assay using the Gen-Probe kit was carried out to detect Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections. Fifteen children visited Ota General Hospital complaining of dry cough and high grade fever. Throat swabs of the patients were examined to detect M. pneumoniae ribosomal RNA by Gen-Prove kit. Five out of 15 patients were positive for DNA probe assay of M. pneumoniae. Clinical and laboratory data including serological examinations were compatible with M. pneumoniae infection in these cases. Following the improvement of clinical symptoms and signs by receiving erythromycin or minocycline, the positivity for DNA probe assay turned to negative. Among the ten patients, who were negative for DNA probe assay, 2 cases were suspected of M. pneumoniae infection on the basis of clinical and laboratory findings. One patient had already taken antibiotics. Therefore, in these two patients, there was a possibility that the bacterial numbers were too small to be detected by DNA-probe assay. The data described above support that DNA-probe assay is useful for the diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infections in the early stage. DNA-probe assay is also valuable to follow up the clinical course of the patients.
