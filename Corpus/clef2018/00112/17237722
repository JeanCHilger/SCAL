Constitutive IL-10 expression by lung inflammatory cells and risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Expression of IL-10 is decreased in lungs of preterm infants. We determined the constitutive and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced IL-10 synthesis by lung inflammatory cells from preterm and term infants and examined their relationship to gestational age and/or incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). A total of 37 infants preterm neonates at gestational ages of 23-27 wk (group 1)
