Left main coronary occlusion from Takayasu arteritis in an 8-year-old child. Takayasu's arteritis (TA) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease that usually affects the aorta and its primary branches and occasionally the coronary arteries. We report the case of an 8-year-old girl who was presented with chest pain and was referred to our institution with the presumptive diagnosis of pneumonia and sepsis. Ultimately, the patient's chest pain was attributed to myocardial infarction secondary to coronary occlusion from TA. She underwent a successful stenting of the left main coronary artery with sirolimus-eluting stent. In a review of the literature, we discuss the demographic profile, clinical and radiographic findings, and available therapeutic options.
