Prognostic significance of the non-size-based AJCC T2 descriptors: visceral pleura invasion, hilar atelectasis, or obstructive pneumonitis in stage IB non-small cell lung cancer is dependent on tumor size. The T2 descriptor for staging non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) contains several non-size-based criteria. It remains unknown whether the prognostic significance of these non-size-based criteria is dependent on tumor size.A total of 10,545 patients with stage IB NSCLC from the California Cancer Registry between 1989 to 2003 were categorized into the following three nonoverlapping criteria: (1) tumor size (T2S) (2) visceral pleura invasion, hilar atelectasis, or obstructive pneumonitis (T2P)A total of 51.1% of patients with stage IB NSCLC were staged by T2S, 43.2% by T2P, and 5.7% by T2C 2,224 stage IB patients (total, 21.1%Prognostic significance of the non-size-based T2 descriptor T2P is dependent on tumor size.
