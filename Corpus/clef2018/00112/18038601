Nitric oxide metabolism in the inclusion of N-acetylcysteine into the complex therapy of patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Thirty-five patients with community-acquired pneumonia were examined. Studies of red blood cells and expired air condensate revealed significant nitric oxide metabolic disturbances in them. In a group of 17 patients, the use of N-acetylcysteine in the complex therapy resulted in the normalization of most parameters that characterized nitric oxide metabolism (nitrates, nitrites, peroxynitrite, NADP-H-diaphorase, and nitrate reductase activity). The positive changes were less significant in the control group receiving mucaltin instead of N-acetylcysteine. The established regularities in the balance change of nitric oxide metabolism in blood and expired air condensate at the height of the disease and positive changes during therapy including N-acetylcysteine suggest that nitric oxide plays an important role in the pathogenesis of community-acquired pneumonia.
