HIV-related pulmonary disorders: practice issues. Pulmonary disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in infants and children infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Diagnosis and management is often difficult in the resource-limited setting, especially as most HIV-related pulmonary disease presents in infancy or early childhood. Knowledge of the causes of pulmonary disease in HIV-infected children in that setting has improved considerably over the last decade, as has the availability of effective treatment for all HIV-infected children, such as cotrimoxazole preventive therapy and antiretroviral therapy. Important causes of acute bacterial pneumonia in HIV-infected children include bacteria such as pneumococci, gram-negatives and staphylococci. Pneumocystis pneumonia is particularly common in HIV-infected infants and a common cause of death. Cytomegalovirus is also found frequently in infants with pneumonia, often as a co-infection with PcP. Tuberculosis (TB) is increasingly recognised as a common cause of acute pneumonia as well as chronic pulmonary disease in regions endemic for TB/HIV. Other important causes of chronic lung disease in HIV-infected children include lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis and bronchiectasis. This review aims to address practical issues that health workers often face in the management of acute or chronic pulmonary disease presenting in HIV-infected children in the resource-limited setting.
