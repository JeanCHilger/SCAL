Prevalence of chlamydia-pneumoniae-specific immunoglobulin M antibody and acute exacerbations of asthma in childhood. Chlamydia pneumoniae is a frequent causative agent of acute respiratory disease and has been recently reported as a possible cause of asthma. We investigated the prevalence of C. pneumoniae infections in childhood patients with acute exacerbations of asthma.One hundred twenty-six childhood patients with acute exacerbations of asthma, 77 with acute bronchitis and 22 Respiratory syncytial virus infections were studied. Serum samples were obtained and tested for C. pneumoniae-specific IgM antibody by Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA).C. pneumoniae IgM-positive results were observed in 48.4% (Index value>or=1.60) and 23% (Index value>or=1.10) of patients with acute exacerbations of asthma. The prevalence of C. pneumoniae-specific IgM was significantly higher in asthma cases than in other subjects (p<0.05).Our data suggest that C. pneumoniae infection may trigger acute exacerbations of childhood asthma.
