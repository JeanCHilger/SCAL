Evaluation of ImmnoCard mycoplasma for diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. We compared the differences of two tests, for the diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection a rapid detection kit for Mycoplasma pneumoniae-specific IgM antibody, ImmunoCard (IC) Mycoplasma test (Meridian Bioscience-USA), and a particle agglutination (PA) test in a retrospective study among 57 patients. They were all suspected to be suffering from atypical bacterial respiratory infection and were checked by the IC test at the Fukuroi Municipal Hospital from January 2004 to January 2006. In this study, the concordance of IC and PA results showed a great difference in children and adults. All children, whose IC test was positive, showed positive PA results. It was particularly difficult to obtain convalescent serum samples in children and IC was useful for children because it was judged by acute phase serum. On the other hand, some in 20% (7/35) of adults, results of the IC test were not concordant with that of the PA test, therefore, diagnosis in adults should be made based on 4-fold rises in titers between paired sera for serological diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection.
