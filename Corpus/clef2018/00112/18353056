Increased numbers of macrophages in tracheal aspirates in premature infants with funisitis. Funisitis is a manifestation of the fetal inflammatory response syndrome, and intrauterine inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of lung injury in premature infants. The aim of the present paper was to examine the relationship between funisitis and lung injury in premature infants born at <28 weeks gestation. The present study focuses on the number of macrophages in tracheobronchial aspirate fluid (TAF).The numbers of CD68-positive cells in cell cytopreps in TAF collected at <24 h of age were determined on immunocytochemistry. The funisitis (+) group (n > 8) was compared with the funisitis (-) group (n > 16).There were no significant differences in gestational age and birthweight between these groups. The duration of intermittent positive pressure ventilation was significantly longer in the funisitis (+) group compared with the funisitis (-) group (P < 0.05). Funisitis (+) infants had increases of CD68+ macrophages in their TAF. The appearance of Wilson-Mikity syndrome (WMS), characteristic of the severe variant of chronic lung disease (CLD), was associated with funisitis (+) infants with higher numbers of macrophages.The presence of macrophages at birth plays an important role in the neonatal lung with funisitis.
