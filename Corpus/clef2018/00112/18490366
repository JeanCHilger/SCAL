Surgical treatment of bronchiectasis: early and long-term results. Management of bronchiectasis remains controversial and information on long-term results of surgical treatment is poor. Clinical records of 45 patients, who underwent surgery for bronchiectasis in an 8-year period, were retrospectively reviewed. Bronchiectasis focus was isolated in 24 cases, associated with a limited homolateral or controlateral focus in 9 and 11, respectively two patients had bilateral evident foci. Bronchiectasis was responsible for lobe destruction in 23 cases. All patients had symptoms: haemoptysis (n=7), recurrent pneumonia (n=7), persistent bronchorrea with recurrent infection (n=15), hemoptysis and recurrent infection (n=16). A total of 23 lobectomies, 11 lobectomies+segmentectomies, 2 bi-lobectomies, 9 segmentectomies and 1 pneumonectomy were carried out. There were no perioperative deaths
