Atypical mycobacterial infection in sequestrated lung in an infant presenting with chronic pneumonitis and recurrent wheezing. An infant was referred to us for persistent cough and recurrent wheezing. Chest X-ray showed an abnormal shadow in the right lower lobe. A volumetric contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CT) scan of the chest revealed an abnormal blood vessel extending from the descending aorta to the right lower lobe and anomalous venous drainage from the right lower lobe into inferior vena cava. Angiography confirmed the CT scan findings. Pulmonary sequestration associated with scimitar syndrome was subsequently diagnosed. Patient underwent right lower lobectomy and right inferior pulmonary vein was anastomosed into the left atrium. Pathological examination after surgery revealed epitheloid granuloma in the sequestrated lung parenchyma and mycobacteria in the draining lymph nodes. This is a rare case of pulmonary sequestration associated with scimitar syndrome and complicated by mycobacterial infection.
