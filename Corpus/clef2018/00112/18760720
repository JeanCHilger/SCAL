Assessment of pneumonia severity: multidetector-row CT in comparison to clinical score CRB-65. This study involved 92 patients with clinically diagnosed pneumonia. Differences in the frequency of typical pattern were calculated for patients with mild pneumonia and for patients with severe pneumonia (confusion, respiratory rate, blood pressure, 65 years of age and older). The frequency of singular morphologic changes did not differ significantly between the two groups. Empyema and pleural effusion, as well as an atelectasis in combination with patchy infiltrates and a positive bronchogram/multisegmental infiltrates, seem to have an influence on severity of pneumonia.
