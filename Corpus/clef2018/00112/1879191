Case-control study on pathogenesis of pneumonia in children aged 0-2 years. In order to know the incidence of risk factors predisposing children to pneumonia, case control study was carried out in six MCH Model Counties in 1986. Single factor analysis showed 29 factors were responsible for the increasing incidence of pneumonia. 13 of 29 factors were major pneumonia risk factors by the standard of means greater than 15 and OR greater than 3. They were malnutrition, anemia, riskets, pneumonia history, repeated colds, chronic diarrhoea, congenital malformation, asphyxia neonatorum, amniotic fluid aspiration, artificial feeding, too much clothing, family member with acute respiratory illness (ARI) and contact with ARI patients. Among them 7 factors were related to individual health condition. Therefore, it is important to improve general health of children so as to reduce the incidence of pneumonia.
