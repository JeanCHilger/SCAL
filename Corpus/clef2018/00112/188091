Neurologic manifestations in Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Apropos of 12 cases. Specific serological methods now enable us to demonstrate that Mycoplasma Pneumoniae is responsible for a variety of neurological symptoms. We describe 12 new cases: 2 encephalites, 8 diffuse polyradiculoneurites and 2 isolated lesions of the cranial nerves. These 12 cases, together with the 42 recorded in the literature, bring total number of published cases to 54. Analysis emphasizes the extreme polymorphism of the neurological manifestations and their favourable prognosis in most cases, however serious the initial symptoms. Although the pathogenesis of neurological symptoms produced by Mycoplasma Pneumoniae is still debatable, evidence supports an immunoallergic reaction.
