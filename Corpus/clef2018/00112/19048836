Clinico-organizational and certain deontological aspects (defects) of medical care for patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia. Objective causes of fatal extramural pneumonia, such as social factors and the severity of the disease, should be considered along with subjective medical errors. Clinical and deontological analysis of lethal cases revealed a number of defects in providing medical care for such patients especially in terms of correction of cardiovascular disorders. Special analysis of 51 medical histories from the ethical viewpoint indicated that 4/5 of the patients had good reasons to set up deontological claims against their doctors.
