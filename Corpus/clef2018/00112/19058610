Epidemiology of radiographically-confirmed and bacteremic pneumonia in rural Thailand. Pneumonia remains a leading public health concern in Thailand. Using population-based surveillance during January 2004-December 2006, we describe incidence, mortality, and bacterial etiologies of chest radiograph-confirmed pneumonia requiring hospitalization in one rural Thai province. Of 19,316 patients who met the case definition for clinical pneumonia, 9,596 (50%) had a chest radiograph, and 4,993 (52%) of those had radiographically-confirmed pneumonia. The incidence of radiographically-confirmed pneumonia ranged from 199 to 256 per 100,000 persons per year 151 (3.0%) patients died. The annual average pneumonia mortality rate was 6.9 per 100,000 persons (range 6.2 to 7.8 per 100,000) and was highest in persons aged < 1 year (64/100,000) and > or = 65 years (44/100,000). Of 4,993 patients with radiographically-confirmed pneumonia, 1,916 (38%) had blood cultures, and 187 (10%) of those had pathogens isolated. Pathogens causing bacteremic pneumonia included B. pseudomallei (15% to 24% of bacterial pathogens), E. coli (9.2% to 25%), S. pneumoniae (7.9% to 17%), K. pneumoniae (2.2% to 6.4%), and S. aureus (4.3 to 5.3%). Bacteremia was significantly associated with pneumonia mortality after controlling for age, sex, HIV status and measures of disease severity in a logistic regression model (OR=5.2
