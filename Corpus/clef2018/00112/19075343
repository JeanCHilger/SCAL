The clinical features of the perinatal hypocsic damage of central nervous system in infants. The aim of the given work was the establishment of biochemical and immunological disorders in infants with the complicated pneumonia on a background of hypocsic damage of central nervous system. In the study 120 infants from 1 month to 6 months old, have been surveyed. Infants have been divided into 2 groups. The first group was composed of 90 infants with a pneumonia, which was subdivided into two subgroups: subgroup A--60 infants with pneumonia on a background of hypocsic damage of central nervous system, and subgroup B--30 infants with actual pneumonia. The second group consisted of 30 infants with hypocsic damage of central nervous system in the anamnesis without pneumonia. Besides general clinical examination, all infants underwent biochemical and immunology researches (general proteins, the general calcium, inorganic phosphorus, the general lipids, cholesterol, beta-lipoproteins, the general phospholipids, kreatine, hydroperoxide, malonic dialdehyde). It was found, that infants with pneumonia against a background of perinatal hypocsic damage of CNS demonstrated changes in biochemical and immunological disturbances of homeostasis. The greatest shifts take place concerning hydroperoxide, malonic dialdehyde, D20 and IgG. Correlated interrelation between immunological and biochemical parameters are broken. Interrelationship between different biochemical parameters was also damaged.
