Diagnostic value of fluorescent quantitation PCR for Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Mp) infection is one of major causes of community-acquired pneumonia. Isolation and culture of Mp are very difficult, fluorescent quantitative PCR is a new technique to detect Mp. The aim of this study was to explore the diagnostic value of fluorescent quantitation PCR for Mp infection.Mp-DNA from the deep respiratory tract secretion of children suffering from pneumonia was tested by a fluorescent quantitative PCR. Totally 256 cases who were positive for Mp DNA were enrolled into this study, 164 (64.1%) were male, 92 (35.9%) were female the age ranged from 9 days to 16 years. All the patients also had results of Mp-IgM test. These patients were divided into 2 groups according to the result of Mp-IgM detection, namely, Mp-IgM positive and negative groups. Area under the roc curve (Az) was used as the index to evaluate the diagnostic value of fluorescent quantitation PCR for Mp detection. The number of Mp-DNA copies, age and course of disease of the 2 groups were also compared.(1) Diagnostic accuracy of fluorescent quantitative PCR for detecting Mp infection was that Az = 0.641. (2) The number of copies of the cases in Mp-IgM positive group was 5.42 +/- 1.26 [log(Mp-DNA copy/ml)], while that of Mp-IgM-negative group was 4.87 +/- 1.29 [log(Mp-DNA copy/ml), t = 3.43, P < 0.05]. (3) The age of Mp-IgM positive group was dramatically younger than Mp-IgM negative group (P < 0.001).The diagnostic accuracy of fluorescent quantitative PCR for mycoplasma pneumoniae (Mp) infection is low however for children whose immunologic systems are not fully developed, this technique has some diagnostic value, and higher number of Mp-DNA copies may support diagnosis of Mp infection.
