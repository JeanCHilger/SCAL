Epidemiology and risk factors of pneumonia in critically ill patients. Intensive Care Unit Group for Infection Control. Risk factors for pneumonia were analysed in a large population of critically ill patients, collected in two prospective multicentre "pneumonia studies" in Italy. Twenty-three intensive care units were involved and the study time was 150 unit months. Only patients without previous pulmonary infection, with intensive care unit stay greater than or equal to 48 hours and no rapidly irreversible illness at admission were included. The incidence of pneumonia in the 1475 selected patients was 15% (220 cases). 239 patients died in ICU the mortality rate was significantly higher in patients developing pneumonia (p less than 0.0001)
