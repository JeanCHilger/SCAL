The use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) to prevent infections in bronchopulmonary dysplasia: report of a pilot study. The incidence and severity of pneumonia, sepsis, and other infections was evaluated in a group of 30 premature infants with moderate to severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), half of whom were randomly treated with intravenous immunoglobulins (group A). The patients were treated until the age of 6 months. They were compared with an untreated control group (group B). The number of pneumonic episodes (5 in group A and 15 in group B) and other infections, excluding sepsis (1 in group A and 7 in group B), were significantly reduced in the treated group (P less than .05). The number of episodes of sepsis, suspected sepsis, and necrotizing enterocolitis were similar in the two groups. The decrease in the number of respiratory and other infections in BPD infants treated with IVIG requires verification by a larger trial.
