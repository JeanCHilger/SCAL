Treatment of 38 cases of foreign body aspiration in children causing life-threatening complications. The objectives of this study were to discuss the clinical magnifications and therapies of tracheobronchial foreign body aspiration (FBA) in children causing life-threatening complications.We retrospectively reviewed 38 cases of FBA with serious complications in children out of 749 cases of FBA in children that had been admitted to and treated in the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, P.R. China, from June 1990 to December 2007. The complications included pneumothorax (14 cases) pneumomediastinum (6 cases)Among the 38 cases of FBA, the FBs in 36 cases were removed by bronchoscopy, and in 2 cases the FBs were removed via thoracotomy. Except for 1 case that resulted in death, the other 37 children were completely cured and discharged to home from the hospital.For children with FBA who experience severe and life-threatening complications from FBA, our recommendation is that emergency measures should be available during FBs removal. With correct judgment and management of the complications of FBA, the mortality rate can be reduced.
