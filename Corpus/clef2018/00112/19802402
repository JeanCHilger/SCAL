Clinical characteristics of respiratory infection due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae in hospitalized children. Studies on Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection are scarce in Chile.To describe clinical characteristics associated with M. pneumoniae in children requiring hospitalization.All children with a respiratory infection requiring hospitalizations between 2000-2005, whom had a M. pneumoniae specific IgM > or = 1:32, were analyzed.Fifty children meeting study criteria were identified with an average length of hospitalization of 4 days (range: 1-10) mean age was 5.4 years (46% were younger than 5 years). Common clinical features were cough (92%), fever (82%), malaise (74%) and respiratory distress (72%). At admission 40/45 children had hypoxemia. Chest-X ray showed interstitial pattern (69.3%), consolidation (51%) and hyperinsuflation (28.5%). Six patients had pleural effusion. Eighty four percent of patients had a favorable clinical outcomeRespiratory infections associated with M. pneumoniae in our series of children had a highly variable and non-specific clinical spectrum. Chest-X rays showed different pattern in concordance with previous publications.
