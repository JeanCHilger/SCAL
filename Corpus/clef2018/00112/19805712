Violence against women and increases in the risk of diarrheal disease and respiratory tract infections in infancy: a prospective cohort study in Bangladesh. To explore whether different forms of violence against women were associated with increased incidence rates of diarrhea and respiratory tract infections among infants.A 12-month follow-up study embedded in a food and micronutrient supplementation trial.Rural Bangladesh.Pregnant women and their 3132 live-born children.Maternal exposure to physical, sexual, and emotional violence and level of controlling behavior in the family.Infants' risk of falling ill with diarrheal diseases and respiratory tract infections in relation to mothers' exposure to different forms of violence.

Any lifetime family violence was positively associated with increased incidence of diarrheal diseases (adjusted rate ratio, 1.20 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.30) and lower respiratory tract infections (adjusted rate ratio, 1.31Family violence against women was positively associated with an increased risk of falling ill with diarrheal and respiratory tract infections during infancy.
