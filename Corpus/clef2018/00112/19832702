Spontaneous pneumomediastinum complicating pneumonia in children infected with the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus. We report two occurrences of spontaneous pneumomediastinum (SPM) complicating pneumonia in Japanese children infected with the novel influenza A (H1N1) virus (IV). General practitioners especially should suspect possible SPM when examining and treating children with the novel influenza accompanied by status asthmaticus or wheezing. The presented patients illustrate the specific clinical and radiological signs associated with SPM complicating pneumonia in children infected with A(H1N1)v.
