Clinical and laboratory features of radiologic pneumonia in severely malnourished infants attending an urban diarrhea treatment center in Bangladesh. We described clinical and laboratory features of infants having radiologic pneumonia with (cases) and without severe malnutrition (controls). Case fatality rate was greater in cases than controls (23% vs. 0%, P = 0.04). The sensitivity and specificity of fast breathing, lower chest wall indrawing, and nasal flaring in diagnosing pneumonia was poor among the cases.
