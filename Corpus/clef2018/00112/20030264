Lipid peroxidation in pneumonia of bacterial and viral etiologies. The blood prooxidant and antioxidant systems were studied in 165 patients with pneumonia of bacterial and viral etiologies over time. There was a regular and significant increase in the levels of malondialdehyde, spontaneous nitroblue tetrasolium test, and catalase in the red blood cells in parallel to this, there was ceruloplasmin activity suppression that depended on etiology, stage, and severity. Much pronounced and long-term impairments of the activity and level of prooxidant and antioxidant indices were suggestive of a severer clinical course and the presence of complications and concomitant diseases of infectious and inflammatory nature.
