Legionellosis at Hadassah University Hospital: a 1-year survey. During 1985 in the Hadassah University Hospital we studied all hospitalized patients whose serum had been submitted for Legionella antibodies. Of 133 patients, 12 (9%) had legionellosis as diagnosed by serology, direct fluorescence, or culture. All Legionella cases appeared to be sporadic, nonseasonal, community-acquired pneumonia. There were no specific environmental co-factors or clustering. A significant predilection of the disease for immunosuppressed individuals was observed the in-hospital mortality was high (5/12), especially if erythromycin therapy was delayed. L. pneumophila and L. bozemanii were the dominant etiological species. In Jerusalem, Legionella is not infrequently the etiological agent in community-acquired pneumonia in immunosuppressed patients.
