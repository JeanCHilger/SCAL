Quantitative evaluation of a clinical intervention aimed at changing prescriber behaviour in response to new guidelines. The objective of the study was to assess prescribers' compliance with guidelines for acute community-acquired pneumonia management in a paediatric university hospital centre before and after its dissemination.This quasi-experimental study without a control group was conducted before and after new community-acquired pneumonia management guidelines were disseminated in a tertiary care paediatric hospital. The pre-intervention (baseline) period was from October 2004 to March 2005. The intervention period was divided into two phases: (1) October 2005 to January 14, 2006 (consultation by peer leaders and networking) and (2) January 15, 2006, to March 2006 (dissemination of official guidelines and of a pre-printed prescription sheet, an educational session led by a peer leader for residents and further networking). We used a compliance score to assess prescriptions written by prescribers who practised in the units where the guidelines had to be followed.The study included a total of 1151 prescriptions. The prescription compliance with the guidelines increased from 131/652 (20.1%) in the pre-intervention period to 264/499 (52.9%) in the post-intervention intervention period: a difference of 32.8% (CI 95% 27.4-38.0). Similar results were found if analysed according to affiliation (emergency department or wards). An inappropriate choice of antibiotic agent represented 347/521 (66.6%) of the causes of non-compliance in the pre-intervention period and 99/235 (42.1) in the intervention period: a difference of -24.5% (95% CI -31.8, -16.8).Guideline dissemination for the management of acute community-acquired pneumonia significantly increased prescriber compliance in the emergency department and on wards.
