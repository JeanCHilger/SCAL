Moxifloxacin monotherapy versus beta-lactam-based standard therapy for community-acquired pneumonia: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. The aim of this study was to compare more conclusively the efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin, a new respiratory fluoroquinolone antibiotic, with beta-lactam-based standard therapy, which has been reported to possess good efficacy for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) identified in PubMed, the Cochrane Library and Embase was performed. Seven RCTs, involving 3903 patients, were included in the meta-analysis. Moxifloxacin monotherapy was associated with similar clinical treatment success rates [clinically evaluable population, odds ratio (OR)=1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81-1.64 intention-to-treat population, OR=1.11, 95% CI 0.86-1.42] and similar mortality (OR=0.98, 95% CI 0.66-1.46) compared with beta-lactam-based standard therapy for CAP. Microbiological treatment success rates in the moxifloxacin group were significantly higher than in the beta-lactam-based therapy group with a statistical margin (OR=1.69, 95% CI 1.02-2.80). No difference was found regarding the incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events between moxifloxacin and beta-lactam-based standard therapy. This meta-analysis provides evidence that moxifloxacin not only can be used as effectively and safely as beta-lactam-based standard therapy for CAP but also possesses a favourable pathogen eradication rate. The once-daily dosing of moxifloxacin monotherapy may be a useful alternative for beta-lactam-based standard therapy.
