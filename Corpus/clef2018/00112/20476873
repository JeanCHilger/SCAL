Pneumonia during pregnancy: radiological characteristics, predisposing factors and pregnancy outcomes. To establish radiological characteristics of pneumonia during pregnancy and to investigate pregnancy outcomes in patients hospitalised due to pneumonia.A population-based study comparing all pregnancies of women with and without pneumonia between was conducted. The diagnosis of pneumonia was confirmed by chest radiograph. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed in order to control for confounders.During the study period, there were 181,765 deliveries, of which 160 were hospitalised due to pneumonia. The most common site of pneumonia was the left lower lobe (53.4%), followed by the right lower lobe (26.3%) and right middle lobe (8.3%) 9.8% were complicated with pleural effusion. Using a multivariable analysis, pneumonia was significantly associated with placental abruption (OR = 4.2Maternal pneumonia is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes and specifically it is an independent risk factor for PTD.
