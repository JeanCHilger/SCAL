Viruses and atypical bacteria associated with asthma exacerbations in hospitalized children. OBJECTIVES AND WORKING HYPOTHESIS: To evaluate the prevalence of respiratory viruses Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae and gain insight into their seasonal circulation pattern in children with acute asthma exacerbations in a temperate southern hemisphere region.Patients hospitalized between 3 months and 16 years of age were included in a 1-year prospective, observational, cross-sectional study. Respiratory secretions were collected and the presence of different viruses and atypical bacteria analyzed by immunofluorescence and polymerase chain reaction.Two hundred nine patients (118 females) aged (mean +/- SD) 4.4 +/- 4 years were included. A potential causative agent was detected in 78% of the patients. The most frequently detected viruses were respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) (n = 85 40%) and rhinovirus (HRV) (n = 52Children with an acute asthma exacerbation presented a high prevalence of respiratory viruses. Most hospitalizations corresponded to seasonal increases in prevalence of HRV and HRSV.
