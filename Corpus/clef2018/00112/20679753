Acute glomerulonephritis associated with Mycoplasma pneumonia. A rare case of acute glomerulonephritis associated with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia is described. Although various types of renal damage associated with Mycoplasma infection have been reported in medical literature, kidney disease resembled classical postinfectious glomerulonephritis in this case. Possibly, the only difference was that the first signs of kidney disease almost coincided with symptoms of respiratory tract infection, instead of appearing at least a week later. The clinical course and outcome of the kidney disease were favorable.
