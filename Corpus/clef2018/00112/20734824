Pathological anatomy in A/H1N1 influenza. Forty autopsy cases died from A/H1N1 influenza in Moscow, the Moscow Region, and Chita were analyzed. Major changes were found to develop in the trachea and lung. The lung showed the pattern of exudative and proliferative stages of diffuse alveolar lesion. In addition, the signs of viremia-associated infectious-toxic shock, as suggested by pronounced changes in the brain, kidneys, liver, spleen, adrenals, and lymph nodes were revealed. Bacterial bronchopneumonia was detected only in 20% of cases.
