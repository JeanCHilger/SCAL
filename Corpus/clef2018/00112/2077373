Cerebellitis during Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is the primary cause of respiratory system diseases in school children and young adults. Most often an infection of the upper respiratory airways is in question, with or without pharyngitis, while clinically manifest pneumonia occurs in only 3-10% of patients. However, multisystemic manifestations of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections can also occur, usually during the first 14 days after the start of respiratory symptomatology, but can also occur as isolated in some cases, with no prior respiratory illness, nor its later occurrence. In our patient there came to a development of pneumonia, exudative pleuritis, sinusitis and cerebellitis. The duration of the disease was protracted, but recovery was complete, without sequelae. The etiological diagnosis was set retrospectively on the basis of the dynamics of the titer of complement fixating antibodies. Mycoplasma pneumoniae should be considered as a possible etiological agent of various clinical syndromes.
