Outcomes of hospitalized patients with bacteraemic and non-bacteraemic community-acquired pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. In contrast to bacteraemic pneumococcal community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), there is a paucity of data on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of non-bacteraemic pneumococcal CAP. This retrospective study compared the outcome of hospitalized patients with bacteraemic and non-bacteraemic pneumococcal CAP treated at a medical centre from 2004 to 2008. Data on clinical outcomes including all-cause mortality, length of hospital stay, need for intensive-care unit admission and extrapulmonary involvement were analysed. In all, 221 patients with pneumococcal pneumonia (87 bacteraemic, 134 non-bacteraemic) were included. Patients with bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia (BPP) were older than those with non-BPP (46·2 ± 30·7 years vs. 21·7 ± 30·8 years, P<0·001) and were more likely to have underlying medical diseases (66·7% vs. 33·6%, P<0·001). The overall mortality rates at 7, 14, and 30 days were significantly higher in BPP than non-BPP patients (12·6% vs. 2·2%, 14·9% vs. 3·7%, 19·5% vs. 5·1%, all P<0·01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that pneumococcal bacteraemia was correlated with extrapulmonary involvement (odds ratio 5·46, 95% confidence interval 1·97-15·16, P=0·001). In conclusion, S. pneumoniae bacteraemia increased the risk of mortality and extrapulmonary involvement in patients with pneumococcal CAP.
