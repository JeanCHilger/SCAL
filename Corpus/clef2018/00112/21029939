Bacterial infections and pediatric asthma. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis seem to have no role in asthma in children. Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae can induce wheezing and cause asthma exacerbations in children, and chronic Chlamydophila infections may even participate in asthma pathogenesis. However, studies have failed to show any benefits from antibiotics for incipient or stable pediatric asthma, as well as for asthma exacerbations in children. Exposure to antibiotics in infancy has been an independent risk factor of later asthma in many studies. A recent study applying molecular biology methods to lower airway samples provided preliminary evidence that lower airways are not sterile but have their own protective microbiota, which can be disturbed in lung diseases like asthma.
