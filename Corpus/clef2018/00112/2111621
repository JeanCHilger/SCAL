Serological and epidemiological characteristics of acute pneumonias caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae in Belgorod. The etiology of the outbreaks of acute pneumonia in Belgorod was established and their epidemiological features were studied. The mycoplasmal etiology of all cases of acute pneumonia in children and adults, appearing alongside acute respiratory infections resulting from the preceding outbreaks caused by influenza viruses A/Prague/, B/Leningrad/369/75, and all types of parainfluenza viruses, was shown. The droplet mechanism of the transfer of infection was established, which was confirmed by the severity of the outbreak and a high rate of infection of the medical staff at hospitals for children and adults, where patients with mycoplasma-induced pneumonia were treated.
