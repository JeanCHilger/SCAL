Agreement in the the determination of the basic cause of death among children under one year of age in the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. An evaluation was undertaken, during the assessment of the quality of the filling up of death certificates, with the purpose of evaluating the agreement, in the determination of the basic cause of death, between the physician who certified the death and a medical team which examined the information provided by hospital records. This survey included the analysis of a sample of deaths among children under one year of age which occurred in the Metropolitan Region of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) in the period from May 1986 to April 1987. As regards neonatal deaths, the greatest concentration of causes of death is perinatal and, despite the changes that have been observed, the composition of the main groups of causes presented no significant alteration. However, within the perinatal group, those generically classified or poorly defined causes were reduced by about 50% and new certificates were made out. Among post-neonatal deaths, we found significant changes, particularly for deaths caused by pneumonia and malnutrition. Given the great interrelation observed among the major causes of death within this group (pneumonia, diarrhoea, malnutrition), it is believed that the investigation of multiple causes of death would provide a more accurate, overall notion of the process that led to death, thus allowing the formulation of a more comprehensive view.
