Detection of inflammatory processes during various diseases by the method of flow cytofluorometry. Oxidative (respiratory) burst is an important manifestation of inflammation. Precise quantitative assessment of this reaction by flow cytometry made it possible to record and evaluate the severity of the inflammatory processes in a wide spectrum of diseases including diphtheria, hepatitis, pneumonia, bronchial asthma, arthritis, vasculitis, postoperative complications, tuberculosis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and myocardial infarction. This approach can be employed as a highly sensitive method of detection of inflammatory reactions and monitoring of their course in various pathological processes.
