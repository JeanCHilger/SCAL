Benefit of early treatment with oseltamivir in hospitalized patients with documented 2009 influenza A (H1N1): retrospective cohort study. We assessed the association between early oseltamivir treatment and influenza complications in hospitalized patients.A retrospective cohort study, including adults with laboratory-confirmed 2009 influenza A (H1N1) in three hospitals in Israel, was performed between July 2009 and January 2010, when admission was limited to high-risk patients. We compared patients treated with oseltamivir early versus late (>48 h after symptom onset). We analysed risk factors for complications, defined as radiographic pneumonia, hypoxia, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admission, haemodynamic support or in-hospital death. Risk factors for complications on univariate analysis were entered into a multivariable logistic regression analysis. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) are reported.Four hundred and forty-nine inpatients treated with oseltamivir were included, 189 (42.1%) of whom were treated early. Influenza complications occurred significantly more frequently among patients treated late with oseltamivir [150/260 (57.7%) versus 67/189 (35.4%), P < 0.001]. Late oseltamivir remained significantly associated with complications in the adjusted analysis (OR 2.37, 95% CI 1.52-3.70). Other independent risk factors included dyspnoea, disease severity on admission, lower sodium and treatment at one hospital rhinorrhoea was protective. In an analysis adjusted for the propensity for early treatment the association remained significant (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.41-3.46). Initiation of oseltamivir >48 h after admission was associated with a higher rate of complications documented after admission (OR 4.09, 95% CI 1.55-10.80). Severe complications (excluding hypoxia and uncomplicated pneumonia) occurred more frequently with late oseltamivir (adjusted OR 3.28,95% CI 1.56-6.89).Initiation of oseltamivir within 48 h of symptom onset was associated with fewer complications in patients hospitalized with 2009 influenza A (H1N1).
