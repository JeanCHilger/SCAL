Pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae in children - comparative analysis of clinical picture. The aim of the study was comparative analysis of clinical picture and prevalence of pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae in children.The study involved 332 children hospitalized in the 3rd Department of Paediatric, Polish Mother's Memorial Hospital - Research Institute, due to pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae - group I or Chlamydophila pneumonia - group II.Over 2003-2009 period there were 1870 children hospitalized due to pneumonia, of which in 332 (17.8%) the Mycoplasma pneumoniae and/or Chlamydophila pneumoniae etiology was confirmed. Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and mixed infection was diagnosed in 198 (10.6%), 102 (5.5%), and 32 (1.7%) children, respectively. The dominant clinical feature in both groups was cough, observed in 186 (93.9%) and 88 (86.3%) children, respectively. Further, reddening of the throat, rhinitis, shortness of breath, fever, enlarged lymph nodes, skin lesions and dyspepsia were also observed. The frequency of specific clinical features in both groups was similar. Statistical relationship (pâ‰¤0.05) was observed only in case of skin lesions. In chest x-ray there was no statistical link as for analyzed changes. Interstitial inflammatory changes were most frequently observed.Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae are significant etiological factors in pneumonia in children, and as such they should be taken into consideration in differential diagnosis of pneumonia in children. The clinical picture of pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae is hardly specific, with basic labs and chest x-ray of little help in differentiation of infection etiology.
