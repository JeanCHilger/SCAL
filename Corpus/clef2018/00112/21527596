Relationship between feeding tube site and respiratory outcomes. It is unclear if placing feeding tubes postpylorically to prevent respiratory complications is worth the extra effort. This study sought to determine the extent to which aspiration and pneumonia are associated with feeding site (controlling for the effects of severity of illness, degree of head-of-bed elevation, level of sedation, and use of gastric suction).A retrospective analysis was performed on a large data set gathered prospectively to evaluate aspiration in critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients. Feeding site was designated by attending physicians and confirmed by radiography. Each patient participated in the study for 3 consecutive days, with pneumonia assessed by the simplified Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score on the fourth day. Tracheal secretions were assayed for pepsin in a research laboratory the presence of pepsin served as a proxy for aspiration. A total of 428 patients were included in the regression analyses performed to address the research objectives.As compared with the stomach, the percentage of aspiration was 11.6% lower when feeding tubes were in the first portion of the duodenum, 13.2% lower when in the second/third portions of the duodenum, and 18.0% lower when in the fourth portion of the duodenum and beyond (all significant at P < .001). Pneumonia occurred less often when feedings were introduced at or beyond the second portion of the duodenum (P = .020).The findings support feeding critically ill patients with numerous risk factors for aspiration in the mid-duodenum and beyond to reduce the risk of aspiration and associated pneumonia.
