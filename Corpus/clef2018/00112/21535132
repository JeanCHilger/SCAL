Severe Mycoplasma pneumoniae-associated mucositis treated with immunoglobulins. Mycoplasma pneumoniae-associated mucositis (MPAM), previously labelled as atypical Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), SJS with minimal or no skin manifestations, is a rare non-respiratory manifestation of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. The nineteen cases described so far in children and young adults were characterized by a high male gender prevalence (16/19) and a good response to appropriate antibiotic treatment and supportive care in the majority of patients. We describe a case of MPAM in a previously healthy girl, who improved after a 0.5 g/kg daily dose of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) for four consecutive days, after traditional therapy had failed.The successful treatment with IVIG described in this report suggests that, where appropriate antibiotic and supportive therapy fails to improve the clinical course of severe MPAM, IVIG treatment is worth considering.
