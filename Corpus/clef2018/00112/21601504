Risk factors for community-acquired pneumonia with influenza A/H1N1 in southern Israel. To determine the risk factors for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with influenza A/H1N1 flu in our region.Adult patients with CAP from July 2009 to February 2010 who were screened for influenza A/H1N1 were identified retrospectively. This was a retrospective case-control study. Cases had CAP with influenza A/H1N1 and controls had CAP without influenza A/H1N1. Patient files were reviewed for demographics, clinical characteristics, treatment, and outcome.Three hundred and eight patients with CAP were identified: 107 cases and 201 controls. For cases vs. controls there were significant differences in the following: median age (40 (range 18-82) vs. 56 (range 18-89) years p<0.001), female gender (63.6% vs. 44.3%In our region CAP with influenza A/H1N1 occurred in younger females of Bedouin Arab origin with less co-morbidity. No difference in mortality was found. We believe that inequalities in socioeconomic conditions could explain our findings.
