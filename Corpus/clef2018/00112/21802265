What is the value of the chest radiography in making the diagnosis of children pneumonia in 2011?. According to the French national health authority guidelines, the diagnosis of childhood pneumonia is based on clinical suspicion and radiological confirmation. The chest radiography is an expensive procedure, and potentially deleterious by its radiating character. We have attempted to clarify its diagnostic value in community acquired pneumonia in children through a literature review using the Pubmed search engine with the following keywords: "pneumonia, child, radiograph".The indication of chest radiography in severe pneumonia achieved unanimity among the various scientific societies. In contrast, in mild forms, tendency of the available data is to not recommend the routine use of chest radiography further randomised and prospective studies are necessary to confirm this trend. Finally, because of the frequency of atypical presentations in children, chest radiography retains all its usefulness in the etiologic diagnosis of fever of unknown origin.
