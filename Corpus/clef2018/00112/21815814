Infectious complications after vehicular trauma in the United States. The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate and define the rates of infectious complications (IC) after vehicular trauma. Secondary goals were to identify the injuries associated with the greatest risk of nosocomial infection and to measure the utilization of hospital resources associated with IC and vehicular trauma.A secondary analysis of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2003-2007) was performed to classify major vehicular trauma injuries utilizing International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) Emergency (E) codes. The post-traumatic IC evaluated were pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), sepsis, and surgical site infection (SSI). All data were analyzed by Ï‡(2) analysis, multivariable logistic regression, and the Cochran-Armitage test for trends.A total of 784,037 vehicular trauma patients were identified (462,543 [59.0%] motor vehicle drivers, 142,283 [18.2%] motor vehicle passengers, 98,767 [12.6%] motorcyclists 6,568 [<1%] motorcycle passengers, and 73,876 [9.4%] pedestrians). Of those sustaining injuries, 44,331 [5.7%] had post-traumatic IC. Pneumonia and UTI were most common after spinal cord injury (SCI), whereas sepsis and SSI were most common after colon injuries. After adjustment by age, sex, and co-morbidities, patients with SCI were 4.4 times as likely (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.20-4.63) and those with cranial injuries were 2.1 times as likely (95% CI 2.06-2.19) to develop IC as patients without these injuries. Secondary infection increased significantly the length of stay and hospital charges in all groups.Patients sustaining vehicular trauma in combination with SCI had the highest rate of IC. Infectious complications increased hospital resource utilization significantly after vehicular trauma. Future root-cause analysis of high-risk groups may decrease complications and hospital utilization.
