Levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia. To study the levels and roles of cytokines TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP).The levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10 in BALF were measured using ELISA in children with MPP at acute stage (n=45) and at remission stage (n=30).  Twenty children without lung lesions severed as the control group.The TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10 levels in BALF were higher in children with MPP at acute stage than those in the control group (P<0.05). The levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in BALF at remission stage were reduced to the levels similar to the control group and were significantly lower than those at the acute stage in children with MPP. However, the levels of IL-10 in BALF remained at higher levels at remission stage in children with MPP.The levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10 in BALF increase in children with MPP at acute stage, suggesting that the cytokines may be involved in the pathogenesis of MPP.
