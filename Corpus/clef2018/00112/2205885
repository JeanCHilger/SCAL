Differential diagnosis of inflammatory lung diseases in childhood. The response to lower airway infection in childhood is different from that in later life. Agent-specific reactions and the age of the child have to be considered in differential diagnosis. Indicators of a bacterial or a viral etiology of the pulmonary findings are often present. However, in some cases the etiology cannot be determined because mixed infections are present. Furthermore, the roentgenographic findings in viral pneumonia may mimic the signs of bacterial infection. Age-specific radiographic findings in pulmonary infections are discussed.
