Pneumonia caused by measles: description of a clinical case of giant cell pneumonia in a non-immunosuppressed adolescent patient. Measles pneumonia is the most frequent complications associated with mortality in this infection. There are two types, one corresponds to the giant-cells pneumonia and the other one to lung superinfection after measles infection. The first one has been occurred in immunosuppressed patients, without rash. We reported a measles pneumonia case in a previously healthy adolescent girl who had a fatal pneumonia by giant cells demonstrated by open lung biopsy. The review of the literature showed that this is very unusual in normal population.
