Detection of hMPV antigen by EIA in clinical specimens. Human Metapneumovirus (hMPV) is one of the latest discovered viruses. It has been classified to Paramyxoviridae family. It is the second viral etiological agent, after RSV, which causes respiratory tract infections (RTI) in children, especially children below 5 years old. It is estimated that 5-25% of RTI in children is due to hMPV. In adults hMPV reinfections are bounded to upper respiratory tract infections. The aim of the study was to establish usefulness of ELISA test in detecting hMPV antigen and to analyze hMPV infection in connection to clinical diagnosis.273 nasopharyngeal swabs from children (189 swabs) and adults (84 swabs) with respiratory tract infections collected from 2008 to 2010 were examined. Due to similarity of hMPV and RSV viruses and overlapping of their epidemic season rapid immunochromatographic test for RSV antigen detection was also performed in case of 120 samples, hMPV antigen was detected in 24.5% of all swabs (n = 67): in 0.0% probes in 2008, 29.0% in 2009 and 36.8% in first quarter of 2010. The highest rate ofhMPV infection was detected from summer of 2009 till the end of March 2010 (VIII-IX 2009 - 62.5%, X-XII 2009 - 44.1% and I-III 2010 -36.8%). We analyzed respiratory tract diseases reported in patients with hMPV infection. Infection due to hMPV was found in 26.5% of children and 24.0% of adults with recognized pneumonia, respectively in 28.4 and 17.6% of patients with bronchitis. Bronchiolitis was diagnosed in two children with hMPV. RSV and hMPV coinfections were confirmed in 15 out of 120 examined probes. Cross reaction pattern was excluded thanks to ELISA hMPV antigen test which was performed with suspension of RSV and thanks to statistical analysis. Coinfections were confirmed in 8% of pneumonia, 11% of bronchitis and 24.2% of the rest concomitant diagnoses.We found hMPV infection as the significant agent ofpneumonia not only in children but also in adults. ELISA hMPV antigen test can be used in diagnosis of etiological agent of respiratory infections in children and adults and in coinfections as well.
