Quantitative Chinese pharmaceutical study on children pneumonia treated by Pu fu-zhou. By method of quantitative Chinese pharmacy, the author studied the children pneumonia cases recorded in two books, "Pu Fuzhou's Medical Cases" and "Pu Fuzhou's Medical Experiences". The rule of Chinese medicine used by Pu Fuzhou was probed preliminarily. It was a characteristic that Pu Fuzhou treated the children pneumonia cases by using Pinelliae Tuber, Exocarpium Citri Rubrum, Jujube and Radix Glycyrrhizae. But the rate of using Herba Lophatherum was less in pneumonia group than in non-pneumonia (contrast) group. According to the rate of overdose prescriptions, 11 Chinese herbal medicines used frequently in pneumonia group were classified into 4 sections. Only overdosage rate of section B (Radix Glycyrrhizae and Peucedanum Decursivum Maxim) was correlated with various kinds of diseases. Referring to the compatibility of dosage of the two Chinese medicines used, there were positive correlation in 35 of 38 pairs, among them, P less than 0.05 in 20 negative correlation in 3 of 38 pairs, among them, P less than 0.05 in 1. It was revealed that in 18 of 38 pairs, in which no significant positive correlation was present, the dosages of Chinese medicine used by Dr. Pu varied with different degree of severity and kind of symptoms he treated.
