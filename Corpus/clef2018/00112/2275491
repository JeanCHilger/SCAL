Guillain-Barré syndrome. 15 pediatric cases. Clinical features and outcome of 15 children with Guillain-Barré syndrome were retrospectively analyzed. In 53% of the patients there was an infectious illness previous to the neurologic symptoms and in five children the etiologic agent was demonstrated. Motor deficit affecting limbs was the most common clinical presentation and facilal paralysis was the most frequent accompanying sign. One of these children developed the Fisher syndrome variant. The outcome was excellent except in one case. We want to remark from this serie high percentage of agents identified in the infectious process previous to Guillain-Barré syndrome and the good outcome of these patients, due to the supportive treatment in the pediatric intensive care unit where they were admitted.
