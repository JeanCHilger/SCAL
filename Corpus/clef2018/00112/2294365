Improved survival after heart-lung transplantation. Sixty-two patients underwent 65 heart-lung transplant operations before April 1989. Thirty of these patients (operated on March 1981 to February 1986) were given cyclosporine and prednisone for immunosuppression. These 30 patients (group 1) are compared with the 32 most recent patients (group 2) treated with cyclosporine, prednisone, and azathioprine. Patient characteristics (group 1 versus group 2) were similar including age (mean 32 versus 26 years) and indication for operation (51% versus 38%, primary pulmonary hypertension 46% versus 45%, Eisenmenger complex
