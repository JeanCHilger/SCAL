Changes in protease inhibitor balance of the bronchoalveolar secretion in children with inflammatory lung diseases. As many as 95 children staying at a clinic were examined for the proteinase-inhibitory balance of the bronchoalveolar secretion in acute pneumonia, relapsing bronchitis and chronic pneumonia in the stage of exacerbation. In all the three diseases, there was a rise of the protein content, trypsin-like activity and alpha 2-macroglobulin level. In acute pneumonia, free antitryptic activity and the level of acid-resistant inhibitors increased in relapsing bronchitis, these parameters remained within the limit of control values, and in chronic pneumonia, they significantly reduced. The degree of inhibition of the antiproteinase potential rose as the catarrhal bronchitis progressed to the purulent pattern.
