Respiratory tract infection and anaesthesia. Haemophilus influenzae pneumonia that developed under anaesthesia. A 2-year-old boy with symptoms of a minor upper respiratory tract infection developed Haemophilus influenzae pneumonia that presented as hypoxaemia under anaesthesia for minor emergency surgery. The patient required 72 hours of mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit after the anaesthetic and thereafter made an uneventful recovery. The value of pre-operative chest radiology and the possible contributory effect of anaesthesia are discussed.
