The first isolation of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in Panama. Mycoplasma pneumoniae was isolated for first time in Panama and identified from a nine years old girl with pneumonia. SP4 medium was used to isolate the bacteria. Confirmatory serological results were obtained by indirect immunofluorescence and were also suggested by the presence of cryoagglutinins in the sera of this patient. DNA hybridization tests (Gen--Probe) were carried out.
