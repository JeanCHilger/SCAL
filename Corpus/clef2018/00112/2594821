Oral and parenteral amoxicillin in the treatment of pneumonia and acute bronchitis. Oral and/or parenteral amoxycillin was used to treat 52 young and adult patients suffering from moderately severe to severe bronchitis, bronchopneumonia or acute lobar pneumonia. The mean time between onset of disease and start of treatment was 3.8 days. Patients received doses of amoxycillin ranging from 375 mg to 1 g 2 to 3-times daily depending on the severity of the condition for a mean of 6.4 days. There was complete resolution of clinical symptoms such as fever, cough and pleural pain after 3 days in all but 3 of the patients. Response was considered excellent or good in 77% of patients and satisfactory in 14%. Mild to moderate side-effects such as urticaria and nausea were reported in 8 patients but were not severe enough to interrupt treatment. Overall, amoxycillin was considered to be effective in 82% and partially so in 11% of the patients treated.
