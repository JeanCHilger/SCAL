Use of the kinetic treatment table to prevent the pulmonary complications of multiple trauma. The kinetic treatment table (KTT) has been developed to prevent and treat complications of immobility. Because atelectasis and pneumonia may be related to immobility, we studied the effect of the KTT on the prevention and treatment of pulmonary complications in a prospective randomized study of 30 patients with severe traumatic injuries. All were receiving mechanical ventilation and were randomly assigned to treatment with a KTT or a conventional bed. Both groups received conventional medical-surgical therapy while pulmonary function, chest roentgenograms, and the presence or absence of lung infection were monitored for one week. In the patients who began the study with a clear chest roentgenogram, atelectasis and pneumonia were significantly less frequent in those treated with a KTT (P less than .05). Thus, the KTT can reduce pulmonary complications in selected patients with multiple trauma. The effect of this benefit on overall outcome is uncertain.
