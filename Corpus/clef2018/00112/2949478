Neurological aspects of mycoplasmal infection. Mycoplasmal infections may be complicated by a wide variety of systemic syndromes, including neurological disorders.

A detailed study of five patients with proven mycoplasma pneumoniae and central nervous system signs showed that immunological factors were involved and suggested that the neurological symptoms were due to a vasculopathy.
