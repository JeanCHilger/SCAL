Sultamicillin--a new antibiotic in the treatment of persistent lower respiratory tract infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae. Haemophilus influenzae is a frequent cause of recurrent or chronic lower respiratory tract infections in patients suffering from cystic fibrosis (CF) and other chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Ampicillin and its derivatives are routinely used in treatment, but resistant strains producing beta-lactamase frequently necessitate the use of other antibiotics. Sultamicillin is a compound agent for oral use in which ampicillin and the beta-lactamase inhibitor sulbactam are linked as a double ester. This combination is active in vitro against many beta-lactamase producing bacteria including ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae. Eight CF children and ten children with other COPD suffering from chronic or recurrent H. influenzae infection of the lower respiratory tract were treated with sultamicillin orally, 25 mg/kg, 12-hourly, for two weeks. Nine infections were caused by ampicillin-resistant strains. At the end of the treatment 65% of the patients were free of H. influenzae. The only adverse reaction was diarrhoea which occurred in 14 patients, and necessitated withdrawal of one patient from the study.
