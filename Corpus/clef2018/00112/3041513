The serodiagnosis of nonpneumococcal bacterial pneumonia. The diagnosis of pneumonia is often difficult when only staining and culture of clinical specimens are used. Testing for antigens or antibody in serum is an alternative method. Many different tests have been described or are currently being used for detection of bacterial pathogens that cause pneumonia, and many more are being developed. It is often difficult to decide which tests to use or how to interpret their results. Frequently, the sensitivity and specificity of each test is not well characterized. A practical approach to serodiagnosis of bacterial pneumonias other than pneumococcal pneumonia is presented. In addition to the sensitivity, specificity, and interpretation of standard serologic tests, the proper role of newer serologic techniques is discussed for each bacterial agent.
