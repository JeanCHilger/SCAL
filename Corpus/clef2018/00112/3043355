Multicenter study of the clinical efficacy and tolerance of roxithromicin compared to doxycycline in lower respiratory infections. In a double-blind, randomised investigation in 305 in-patients, roxithromycin and doxycycline were compared in two groups of patients with low respiratory tract infections. Three hundred cases were analyzable for safety and 276 for clinical efficacy. Mean duration of treatment was 9 days in both groups. Clinical effectiveness was 83% (112/135) for roxithromycin (150 mg bd) and 84% (118/141) for doxycycline (200 mg once daily), the difference not being statistically significant. A 90% clinical response rate was obtained with roxithromycin in pneumoniae. Safety and tolerance were good and comparable in both groups.
