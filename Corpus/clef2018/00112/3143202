Characteristics of the immunologic response to Mycoplasma pneumoniae as a polyclonal lymphocyte activator. M. pneumoniae, used as mitogen, was shown to initiate the synthesis of antibodies to salmonellae in the culture of lymphocytes obtained from healthy donors as actively as lectins and Staphylococcus aureus protein A. In these experiments IgG antibodies were mainly synthesized. The serological study of a group of persons (333 subjects) for 2.5 years revealed that seroconversion to M. pneumoniae and simultaneously to viruses occurred in 78% of cases. In more than a half of the cases a rise in the titers of antibodies to M. pneumoniae and simultaneously to salmonellae was found to occur with no cases of salmonellosis being registered. The results of this study make it possible to come to the conclusion that M. pneumoniae is a polyclonal activator of antibody-producing cells in vitro and, probably, in vivo.
