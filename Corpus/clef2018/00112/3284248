Vaginal Streptococcus B colonization in pregnancy. 500 women in late pregnancy (III. trimenon) have been examined for colonization of group B streptococci by means of vaginal swabs. Identification of bacteria was effected with modified Wallerstr√∂mtest, CAMP-test and coagglutination. In 19 pregnant women (3.8%) B-streptococci could be found. In most cases type I was predominant, followed by type II and III. One newborn child died with symptoms of early onset disease. In mother and infant the same serotype could be found (III/R). The titre of maternal antibody, performed in B-streptococci ELISA was too low. A carrier with B-streptococci had a stillbirth. There existed a congenital abnormality. Both in mother and infant the serotype Ib/c was present. The titre of maternal antibody in B-streptococci ELISA was lowered.
