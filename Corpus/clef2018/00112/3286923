Fundamental and clinical evaluations of ceftriaxone in neonates. The antibacterial efficacy of ceftriaxone (CTRX) against group B Streptococcus and its clinical efficacy in newborns were examined, and the results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. MIC's of CTRX against 55 strains of B group Streptococcus from the pregnant vagina were 0.10 micrograms/ml or lower. 2. Efficacies of CTRX were good to excellent in 8 cases administered for treatment, 3 cases for prophylaxis and 1 for observation of adverse reactions. Observed adverse reactions included diarrhea in 4 cases and vomiting in 2 cases. As abnormal laboratory parameters, eosinophilia and thrombocytosis were observed in 1 case each. 3. An examination of intestinal bacteria in 9 cases revealed that CTRX gave as much influence to the flora as other third-generation cephems. 4. An examination for the vitamin K deficiency in 11 cases found a prolongation of prothrombin time (PT) in 3 cases and protein induced by vitamin K absence (PIVKA) II positive in 2 cases. 5. Testing of platelet aggregation with adenosine diphosphate (ADP) in 7 cases showed little influence of CTRX.
