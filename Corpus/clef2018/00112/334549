Group B streptococci: a new threat to the newborn. 8 newborns with early onset group B streptococcal infection and two patients with late onset meningitis were observed during a period of three years. Respiratory distress, early onset of apnoic spells, and roentgenographic signs of hyaline membrane disease or perinatal pneumonia may lead to early diagnosis, especially if shock develops. The fatal course can only be prevented by prompt antibiotic treatment.
