Lung diseases after bone marrow transplantation. Results of a clinical, radiological, histological, immunological and lung function study. The case histories of 72 subsequently treated patients - 44 with acute leukemia, 10 with chronic myeloid leukemia, 16 with severe aplastic anemia and 2 with neuroblastoma - were analyzed after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) with respect to pulmonary diseases. Thirty-eight patients suffered from a total of 51 pulmonary complications, which led to death in 20. Of 13 patients, 3 died of bacterial pneumonia, all of them during granulocytopenia 2 of 6 patients died of fungal pneumonia and 2 out of 3 of a mixed bacterial-mycotic infection. Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) led to death in 2 patients. A granulocyte count under 500/microliter correlated significantly (P less than 0.002) with the fatal outcome of bacterial, fungal and ARDS pneumonia as well as with bronchitis. Viral pneumonia led to death in 8 of 9 patients
