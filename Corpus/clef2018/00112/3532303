Prevalence of Legionnaires' disease in pneumonia patients admitted to a Danish department of infectious diseases. During a 14-month study period, 92 patients admitted to the University Clinic for Infectious Diseases with pneumonia were investigated to determine the prevalence and severity of Legionnaires' disease (LD). The diagnosis of LD was based on positive serology. Antibodies to 10 different legionella antigens--Legionella pneumophila serogroups 1-6, Fluoribacter (Legionella) bozemanae, F. dumoffii, F. gormanii, and Tatlockia (Legionella) micdadei--were measured by the microagglutination (MA) and indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) techniques. LD was diagnosed in 22 patients showing a 4-fold or greater rise of MA titers. 10 patients showed a 4-fold or greater rise of IFA titer, 2 had standing high titer. One patient died. Legionella infection was the second most common cause of pneumonia. However, in half of the cases legionella infection occurred concomitantly with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia psittaci, or viral infections. All 22 LD cases were sporadic. LD had been contracted abroad by 6 patients. Two of the legionella pneumonias were hospital-acquired. Half of the LD patients were older than 60 years. The majority of cases occurred during the winter months. Neither clinical chemistry parameters nor clinical features could distinguish LD from other types of pneumonia.
