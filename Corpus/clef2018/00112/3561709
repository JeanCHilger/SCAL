Neurological complications associated with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in children. Meningoencephalitis associated with serological evidence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection is reported in two children, aged 11 and 12. In both cases the neurological illness started with an attack of generalised convulsions, followed by changes in the electroencephalogram, which lasted up to 5 wks. Both children recovered completely without signs of sequelae. Attention is drawn to the wide spectrum of neurological complications which can be associated with this infection.
