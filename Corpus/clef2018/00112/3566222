Experimental and clinical study of the use of lysozyme in combination with chemotherapeutic agents. Antimicrobial effect of lysozyme in combination with a wide set of antimicrobial drugs (38) was studied with respect to 74 bacterial cultures. It was shown that synergism of the antimicrobial effect in the presence of lysozyme was variable for drugs differing in the mechanism of their action and depended on the pathogen species. The most pronounced synergistic effect was observed with respect to grampositive bacteria with the use of many drugs such as benzylpenicillin, ampiox, morphocycline, erythromycin and others. The potentiation effect of lysozyme was less pronounced with respect to Coli bacteria and Pseudomonas. Combination of lysozyme with aminoglycosides such as gentamicin, tobramycin, sisomicin and amikacin resulted in increasing antimicrobial effect with respect to practically all the microbial cultures tested. The clinical trials of the efficient combinations of the antibiotics and lysozyme studied experimentally proved their high efficacy in combined therapy of patients with pneumonia and pyelonephritis of bacterial genesis. Thus, in children with acute pneumonia (92 observations) it resulted in more rapid elimination of the temperature reaction, toxic and cardiorespiratiry syndromes, cough and physical signs of the disease. In treatment of 83 children with pyelonephritis complete clinico-laboratory remission was observed in 81 per cent of the cases against 56.4 per cent in the patients treated with the antibiotics without lysozyme.
