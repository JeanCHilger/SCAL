A simple index to identify occult bacterial infection in adults with acute unexplained fever. Patients with acute fever (less than three weeks' duration) and no localizing symptoms or physical findings to suggest a source (unexplained fever) may have self-limited illness or occult bacterial infection requiring prompt treatment. To develop a management strategy for patients with unexplained fever, we studied 880 adults who were evaluated for acute fever in an emergency room. At presentation, 135 (15%) patients had unexplained fever. Occult bacterial infection was found in 48 (35%) of these 135 patients, and 21 (44%) of 48 infected patients had bacteremia. Four bacteremic patients were incorrectly discharged from the emergency room without antimicrobial therapy. Neither a "toxic" appearance of the patient nor an initial temperature of greater than or equal to 39.4 degrees C (103 degrees F) were predictive of occult bacterial infection. An index of predictive features was developed that included: age 50 years or older diabetes mellitus
