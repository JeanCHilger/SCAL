Heterosexual transmission of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). A man who, only in 1979 and on a few occasions, had homosexual contacts, transmitted AIDS virus HTLV-III in 1980 and 1981 to two previously healthy women who did not belong to any AIDS risk group. One of them now has an early form of AIDS, while the other died of AIDS in its full form and her child, born in 1983, has fairly far progressed early symptoms of AIDS. Serum antibodies against HTLV-III were demonstrated in all four subjects.
