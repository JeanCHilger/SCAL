Importance of the cytochemical study of blood leukocyte enzyme activity in acute pneumonias. The authors describe the results of cytochemical study of the activity of alkaline and acid phosphatase, myeloperoxidase and NADP-HH oxidase of neutrophils, acid phosphatase, succinate dehydrogenase and mitochondrial alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenases of peripheral blood lymphocytes in 90 patients with acute pneumonia on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 14 and 21 of the disease. It has been shown that changes in the activity of leukocytic enzymes are early and sensitive signs of acute inflammation in the lungs, reflecting the gravity and character of the disease. Some features of the enzymatic alterations depending on the degree of respiratory failure and allergic complications have been disclosed.
