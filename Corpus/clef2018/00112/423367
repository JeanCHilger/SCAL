Pharmacokinetics and results of clinical administration of CS-1170. II. Results of clinical administration of CS-1170 (author's transl). The intravenous preparation of CS-1170 was administered in 9 cases of pediatric disease and was excellent or good in 5 cases (55.6%). It was poor in 3 of 4 cases of Mycoplasma pneumonia. We think that the dose of 50 mg/kg/day can exert an effect regardless of the intensity of symptoms. Through our present experiences with the excellent or good cases, an intravenous drip or intratracheal injection for 3 approximately 5 days is effective. Although there was no abnormality in the biochemistry or electrolyte findings before or after administration, eruption developed in one of the cases in which the drug was administered for 6 days.
