Comparison of birth weight-gestation distribution in cases of stillbirth and neonatal death according to lesions found at necropsy. The birth weight/gestation distribution of a large series of cases of perinatal death has been analysed according to the lesion (or lesions) present at necropsy. Among the lesions associated with low gestation babies dying with hyaline membranes have a much higher mean birth weight for gestation than either the babies with intraventricular haemorrhage or "no cause found." Among infants dying of intrapartum asphyxia or cerebral birth trauma it was found that those who were stillborn with trauma had, at term, a significantly higher mean birth weight than the control livebirths, and that, at all gestations, the stillbirths with trauma were, on average, heavier than the babies dying neonatally with this lesion. Cases of intrapartum asphyxia were smaller than the stillbirths with trauma, but those dying during the second stage of labour were larger than those dying during the first stage.Cases of intrauterine pneumonia-that is, stillbirths and first-day deaths-were also shown to be larger for length of gestation than cases of extrauterine pneumonia-that is, deaths between the second and the 28th day. The cases with haemorrhagic pneumonia, however, were, at least at term, smaller than the cases of extrauterine pneumonia, and cases of massive pulmonary haemorrhage showed evidence of growth retardation at all gestations.
