Croup: an 11-year study in a pediatric practice. The etiology and epidemiology of croup were studied in a pediatric group practice over an 11-year period, 1964 to 1975. Croup was diagnosed in 951 instances in 6,165 cases of lower respiratory tract infection (LRI) studied. As census figures of the practice clientele were available, attack rates were calculated. The incidence of total LRI was highest in the first year of life. In contrast, the attack rate for croup was highest in the second year of life the rate declined gradually after that age. Croup was not diagnosed in the first month of life. Boys were 1.43 times more likely to develop croup than were girls. Three hundred sixty agents were isolated from the 951 croup cases. The parainfluenza viruses accounted for 74.2% of all isolates
