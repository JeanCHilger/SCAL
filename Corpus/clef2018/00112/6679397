Postpneumonic pleural suppuration in children. Postpneumonic pleural suppuration is a common condition seen in paediatric practice in Nigeria. One hundred and twenty cases seen at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu, over a 4-year period were reviewed. The patients were aged between 1 1/2 months and 16 years. History of antecedent measles was elicited in 27 of the children, and 70% of the patients presented to the hospital later than 7 days after the onset of symptoms of pleura suppuration. From the pleural aspirates of 106 cases (88.3%) Staphylococcus aureus was cultured in 31.2%, but there were no organisms cultured in 39.4%. Twenty-nine children were treated by chemotherapy only 11 of them (37.9%) died. Sixty-eight cases had tube drainage of the pleural collections, with 6 deaths (8.8%). Twenty-three patients had thoracotomy, evacuation of the suppurative lesion and decortication of the lung, with no mortality. There was overall hospital mortality of 14.2%, the highest mortality being in children who had associated measles, gastroenteritis, anaemia or malnutrition. Early surgical drainage by tube thoracostomy or by thoracotomy and decortication in addition to appropriate and adequate antibiotic therapy is the treatment of choice.
