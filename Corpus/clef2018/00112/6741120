Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia. Experience at a referral center. Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia is usually a benign illness, and respiratory complications and extrapulmonary manifestations occur rarely. In this series, patients admitted to a referral hospital with this disorder had unusual symptoms, signs and findings on chest roentgenograms and laboratory studies. Pneumonia was often severe and extrapulmonary manifestations were frequent, resulting in prolonged hospital stays and illnesses. Although this extreme end of the spectrum of disease caused by M pneumoniae is not representative of this type of pneumonia as seen in outpatients, it is important to realize that patients admitted to hospital with severe, complicated pneumonia frequently have unusual manifestations of a common disease.
