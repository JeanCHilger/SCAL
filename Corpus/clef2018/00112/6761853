Relation between neonatal pneumonia and maternal carriage of group B streptococci. Obstetrical and neonatal complications were studied among 143 urogenital carriers of group B streptococci (GBS) and their 144 infants and compared with complications occurring in a control group of 157 pregnant non-carriers and their 158 infants. All parturients had experienced uncomplicated pregnancies until week 36. 26 infants, 13 from each group, were transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit for treatment and observation within the first 7 days of life. Among these infants, 11/13 infants of GBS carriers contracted pneumonia and pulmonary adaptation syndrome, in contrast to 3/13 infants of non-carriers (p less than 0.05). The GBS carrier infants transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit had higher birth weights and higher gestational ages. Within the group of infants born to GBS carriers, those with pulmonary diseases evidenced abnormal fetal heart rate changes during labour in a higher rate than in the controls. Puerperal endometritis occurred with a significantly higher frequency among the GBS carriers (7/143) than among the non-carriers (0/157). Maternal carriage of GBS is a high risk factor for both the mother and her newborn, also after an otherwise uncomplicated pregnancy.
