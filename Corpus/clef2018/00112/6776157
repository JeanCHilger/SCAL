Serological diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection by enzyme immunoassay. Antibodies against Mycoplasma pneumoniae antigen obtained by Tween-ether treatment from purified M. pneumoniae were measured by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Paired sera from 19 patients with pneumonia and from 13 patients with acute pancreatitis with a significant rise in complement fixing antibodies against M. pneumoniae were studied. Single sera from healthy 1-year-old children were used as controls. High levels of IgG and IgM class antibodies were seen in sera from patients with pneumonia while most patients with acute pancreatitis and all the children showed low levels of antibodies. The results indicate that ELISA using Tween-ether treated M. pneumoniae antigen could be used successfully in the specific laboratory diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection.
