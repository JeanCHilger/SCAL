Tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, and clindamycin. The tetracyclines are active in vitro against many urinary tract pathogens such as Chlamydia, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Brucella, rickettsiae, and Nocardia. Chloramphenicol is used primarily for anaerobic infections, Haemophilus influenzae meningitis, and infections due to Salmonella typhi. Erythromycin is active in vitro against M. pneumoniae, Legionella spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, and group A beta-hemolytic streptococci it may also be used as prophylactic therapy for subacute bacterial endocarditis and for recurrence of acute rheumatic fever in patients who are allergic to penicillin. Clindamycin should be used primarily for the treatment of anaerobic infections. The tetracyclines may cause gastrointestinal upset
