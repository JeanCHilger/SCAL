Myocarditis as a complication of infantile Chlamydia trachomatis pneumonitis. The case is presented of an infant with chlamydia pneumonitis who developed clinical and electrocardiographic signs of myocarditis. No significant antiviral antibodies developed. Elevated antichlamydial IgG titers were demonstrated during the initial phase. These declined during convalescence. This report provides further evidence associating C. trachomatis with infectious myocarditis.
