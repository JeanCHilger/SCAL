Studies on 9,3"-diacetylmidecamycin dry syrup in pediatric acute respiratory tract infections (author's transl). The authors have carried out some studies on MOM dry syrup in the field of pediatrics and the results were as follows. 1. After oral administration of MOM at 20 mg/kg, the serum level peaked at 30 minutes and MOM could still be detected in the serum at up to 4 hours. The half-life was 0.67 hour. The urinary recovery rate of MOM was 1.43% up to 6 hours after this oral administration. 2. The clinical efficacy rates with MOM continuous treatment at a daily dose of 19.4 to 50.0 mg/kg (almost about 30 mg/kg) were 85.7% for upper respiratory tract infections, 66.7% for lower respiratory tract infections and 95.7% for Mycoplasma pneumonia. 3. It was easy to administer MOM orally even to the younger children. Although MOM was administered for 4 to 21 days, no side effects were observed locally or systemically except for transient slight diarrhea. These results confirmed the usefulness of MOM in the treatment of acute respiratory tract infections in children.
