Clinical studies of 9,3"-diacetylmidecamycin in pediatric field (author's transl). Clinical trials of 9,3"-diacetylmidecamycin (MOM), a new macrolide antibiotic were carried out on 46 pediatric patients of 1 month to 11 years old with infections (acute pharyngitis 12, acute tonsillitis 1, acute bronchitis 14, asthmatic bronchitis 10, acute pneumonia 1, primary atypical pneumonia 2, Mycoplasma pneumonia 4 and pertussis 2). As a rule, MOM was given orally at a daily dose of 20 approximately 40 mg/kg divided into 3 times. The clinical results were excellent in 5 patients, good in 21, fair in 7 and poor in 13 and the efficacy rate was 56.5%.
