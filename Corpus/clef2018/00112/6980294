Clinical results of 9, 3"-diacetylmidecamycin dry syrup in the pediatric field (author's transl). 9, 3"-Diacetylmidecamycin (MOM), a new macrolide antibiotic, was administered to 28 patients: 6 with pharyngitis caused by Group A beta-Streptococcus, 2 with lacunar tonsillitis, 8 with upper respiratory tract infection, 6 with acute bronchitis, 3 with Mycoplasma pneumonia, 1 with primary atypical pneumonia, 1 with pneumonia caused by H. influenzae and 1 with whooping cough. MOM in the form of fine granules was administered at a daily dose of about 20-30 mg/kg divided into 3 doses. Isolated group A beta-Streptococcus strains were eradicated in only 1 out of 6 strain S. One strain of H. influenzae was eradicated. The clinical results could be obtained with 21 cases and the response was excellent in 1 case, good in 7, fair in 3 and poor in 10. Although diarrhea was found in 3 cases during the administration of MOM, it was not clear whether these phenomena were caused by MOM, because of the prevalence of diarrhea among the children treated by us at that time.
