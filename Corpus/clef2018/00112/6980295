Clinical study on 9,3"-diacetylmidecamycin in the field of pediatrics (author's transl). We have studied clinically on 9,3"-diacetylmidecamycin (MOM), a new macrolide antibiotic derived from midecamycin. The following results were obtained. 1) Serum concentration. To the the same child weighing 15 kg and aged 4 years, the MOM dry syrup was administered orally at single doses of 150 mg (10 mg/kg) and 300 mg (20 mg/kg) and then the MDM fine granules at a single dose of 300 mg (20 mg/kg). At dosages of 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg of MOM dry syrup and 20 mg/kg of MDM fine granules, the serum concentrations were 0.5 microgram/ml, 0.8 microgram/ml and not detectable (N.D.) respectively, at 45 minutes after administration 0.4, 0.6 and N.D. at 1 hour
