Role of Mycoplasma infection in pediatric pathology. The review presents data from the literature showing the variability of manifestations of mycoplasmal infection (M. pneumoniae, M. hominis, T-strain) in childhood. The etiological role of M. pneumoniae (as a monoantigen and in association with respiratory viruses) in acute respiratory infections and pneumonias has been established. M. pneumoniae also plays a certain role in the development of attacks of bronchial asthma and chronic recurrent pneumonias. M. hominis, being an urogenital mycoplasma, may also be the causative agent of acute respiratory infections and pneumonias. A high rate of infection of newborn babies with M. hominis and T-strains is noted. There is evidence indicating frequent and generalized mycoplasmal infection in infants in the perinatal period. In addition to changes in the lungs, mycoplasmal infection produces lesions in the heart, liver, kidneys, central nervous system and other organs, produces the development of hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. Some studies indicate the possibility of intrauterine mycoplasmal infection and its terotogenic effect on the human fetus.
