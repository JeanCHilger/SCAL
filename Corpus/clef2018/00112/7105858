Significance of roentgenographic abnormalities in children hospitalized for asthma. The relatively high incidence of roentgenographic abnormalities in patients hospitalized for acute asthma has led some to recommend that all such patients receive chest x-ray examination upon admission to the hospital. We studied the incidence and clinical predictability of the roentgenographic findings by asking the admitting physician to indicate, prior to obtaining a roentgenogram, whether he thought pneumonia, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum or other significant abnormality was present. A treatment plan was also outlined at that time. Seven of 128 patients (5.5 percent) had roentgenograms suggestive of pneumonia or pneumothorax three of these were suspected clinically. In 14 cases the clinical suspicion of pneumonia or pneumothorax was not borne out roentgenographically. The initial treatment plan was altered in only three cases. The low incidence of roentgenographic abnormalities and the failure of these minor abnormalities to substantially influence treatment suggest that routine chest roentgenograms may not have to be performed on all children hospitalized for acute asthma.
