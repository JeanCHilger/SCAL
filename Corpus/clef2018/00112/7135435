Risk of infection by iatrogenic asplenia--a study about the indication of exploratory laparotomy with splenectomy (LS) in case of Hodgkin's disease. A retrospective evaluation of the data of all patients with Hodgkin's disease (collective of Freiburg) treated between 1964 and 1977 was made in order to find out if there was an increased risk of infection after a diagnostic laparotomy with splenectomy (LS). Among a total number of 592 patients, 277 had been submitted to LS (since 1969). 185 patients had a total remission, 130 of them after primary LS, 34 after secondary LS, and 21 without any treatment of the spleen. An inquiry conducted by means of a questionnaire showed no differences between the compared groups as to the frequency of not septic infections such as pulmonary tuberculosis, angina tonsillaris, pyodermia, sinusitis, complications in wound healing, urinary tract infections, and infections of the intestine. However, there was a significant increase of unspecific pneumonias and herpes zoster manifestations after (long-term observation) secondary LS. There were no differences regarding the frequency of febrile and not febrile colds, but after LS, the colds had a longer and more severe course.--The analysis of the cause of death in the 277 patients who died showed a lethal septicaemia in seven cases. All these patients had been submitted to LS. In three of these patients, a recurrence was proved or could not be excluded, four presented as total remission with respect to Hodgkin's disease.--These results and the communications of literature permit to conclude that the iatrogenic asplenia represents an additional immunological risk. They suggest a further reduction of the indication for LS, the criteria of which are discussed.
