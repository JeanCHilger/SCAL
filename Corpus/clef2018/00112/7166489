Short term hospitalization, with permanent presence of parents, in emergency pediatric situations. In our experience it is possible to consider short-length stays in many pediatric emergency situations. Parental company of the child during short-length hospitalisations is useful and necessary, and not only well tolerated but even desired by the health staff. Acute gastroenteritis is a typical example of a medical routine situation where a short-length stay yields benefits. Of 57 patients with severe dehydration, 54 (94.7%) were able to return home within 48 h after admission. The evolution after returning home of 55 other patients, where the dehydration rate was not taken into account, was very satisfactory in 85.4% of them following only dietary guidance. Permanent parental presence at the side of the child alters the classical activity of an emergency department, and stimulates the health staff to think about new ideas.
