A pointing sign for localization in early pneumonia. In a study of the first 48 hours of 500 consecutive cases of early pneumonia mostly complicating the influenzal syndrome in Benin City, Nigeria, radiological examination which shows opacities in 12--18 hours confirmed accurate localization in 50 per cent of cases localized by physical examination alone, and in 90 per cent of cases cross-checked by the pointing sign--asking the patient to cough hard and point to the side where pain is clearly felt.
