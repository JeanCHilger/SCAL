Changes in the serum lipid indices in acute pneumonia and their clinical significance. Some lipid indices were studied in the course of acute bacterial and viral pneumonias in 102 patients, aged from 18 to 45. Statistically significant increase of total lipids, NEFA and EFA was established as well as insignificant increase of triglycerides and significant decrease of alpha-lipoproteins. Bacterial pneumonias are distinguished by a more manifested increase of total lipids and EFA, the viral pneumonias--by a more markedly decrease of alpha-lipoproteins. The discrepancies are statistically significant. The changes are of a transitory character and on the 40 th day of the treatment significant tendencies for normalization of the indices changed were established.
