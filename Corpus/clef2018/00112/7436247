Foreign bodies in the larynx and tracheobronchial tree in children. A review of 225 cases. In a study of 225 patients with foreign bodies in the larynx, trachea and bronchi, 77% were 36 months of age or less. The male-female ratio was 2:1. Food or food derivatives were the causative agent in 70% of the cases, with 38% due to a portion of nut. The foreign body involved the right and left bronchus with equal frequency. A choking episode followed by an audible wheeze (55%) was the most common presenting complaint. Obstructive emphysema was demonstrated in 60% and was best demonstrated by inspiration-expiration chest roentgenograms or fluoroscopy. A radio-opaque object was seen in 13%. Two hundred ten foreign objects (93%) were removed by endoscopy. Four patients required pulmonary resection for bronchiectasis and in three patients bronchotomy was performed. Five patients expelled the foreign body spontaneously, two patients were transferred to another hospital, and one foreign body was not recovered. There was no mortality.
