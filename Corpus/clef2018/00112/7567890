Characteristics of pneumonia in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. In healed tuberculosis, pneumonia more frequently arises in the zones of pronounced residual changes. In active tuberculosis combination of tuberculosis with pneumonia often takes place in intact bronchopulmonary segments. Pneumonia in tuberculous patients takes a lingering course in the presence of pneumosclerotic changes in the lungs, tends to acquire bronchial forms, is characterized by slow involution of inflammation, runs atypically in combination of pneumosclerotic changes in the lungs, bronchial stenoses and abnormal cell composition of bronchoalveolar washout. The diagnosis and treatment present difficulties in pneumonia location in the zone of distinct post-tuberculous pneumosclerosis with small segmental lesion. Resolution of inflammatory foci in the lungs in lingering pneumonia may course as long as 8-10 weeks.
