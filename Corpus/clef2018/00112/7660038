Plasma levels of vitamin A, carotenoids and retinol binding protein in children with acute respiratory infections and diarrheal diseases. The present study was carried out in order to assess the plasma levels of vitamin A, carotenoids and retinol binding protein (RBP) of three-hundred and eleven children aged from seven months to eleven years, who had a history of upper respiratory infection (URI), pneumonia and diarrhoea.
