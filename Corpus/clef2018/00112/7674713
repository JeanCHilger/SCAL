Thoracic radiography is indicated in the examination of acute abdomen! The cause of abdominal symptoms may be found in the thorax. Plain x-rays of the abdomen remain an integral feature of the diagnostic work-up in cases of acute abdomen. Chest x-rays, often recommended in the USA, are standard routine at only one third of Swedish radiology units. The article outlines the advantages of including chest x-ray in the abdominal examination: it facilitates the detection of pneumoperitoneum, it yields (pre-operative) cardiopulmonary information, and it may show abdominal pain to be of extra-abdominal aetiology. Regarding the latter point, a study of 555 cases showed the chest x-ray to yield valuable information in 14 cases.
