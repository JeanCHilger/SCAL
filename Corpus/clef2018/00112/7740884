Phasic changes in the brain blood-flow indices of young children in the acute period of complicated pneumonia. Cerebral hemodynamics has been studied rheoencephalographically in 39 infants early in the course of complicated pneumonia and in 19 healthy controls. The former exhibited phasic changes in cerebral circulation. On the disease day 3 and 10, a significant reduction in the blood flow took place. In children under 6 months of age cerebral circulation is less active than in those over 6 months throughout the whole acute period of complicated pneumonia.
