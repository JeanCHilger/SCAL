Isolation of enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis strains in Poland. Fecal samples of 120 children (2 weeks to 3.5 year old) hospitalized in a pediatrical ward were investigated. In 56 of them diarrhea was observed. Out of 45 anaerobic gram-negative isolated rods, two Bacteroides fragilis strains were enterotoxigenic. Production of enterotoxin was established on the Human Colonic Epithelial Cell Line HT29/C1.
