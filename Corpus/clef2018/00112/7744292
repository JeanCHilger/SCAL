Development of high risk infants following premature membrane rupture in a neonatal intensive care unit. The development of 77 neonates, with maternal premature membranes rupture in a neonatal intensive care unit was reviewed. Clinical characteristics, evolution, complications and mortality, as well as the risk factors for mortality were reviewed. The incidence was 25.8% in 298 neonates discharged, maternal age 25 + 6 years (X and standard deviation), number of gestations 2 + 1, maternal infection in 11 (14.2%), chorioamnioitis in 18 (23.3%), the ruptured membranes time was > 24 hours in 48%. Vaginal birth were 37.7%, and cesarean section 59.7%. Males predominated with 61%, gestational age 31 + 2 weeks, birth weight 1577 + 530. The three main morbidity causes were nosocomial pneumonia (44.1%), respiratory distress syndrome (39%), and intrauterine pneumonia (33.8%). By clinic and laboratory 3.8% neonates had septicemia, but only eight had some positive culture. Disease during pregnancy, vaginal birth, prematurity and neonatal sepsis were risk factors for mortality. Incidence of infants with PROM and neonatal sepsis is higher than majority of other reports. All premature neonates with PROM more disease during pregnancy, vaginal birth, or neonatal sepsis, have high risk for mortality, then they need specially cares.
