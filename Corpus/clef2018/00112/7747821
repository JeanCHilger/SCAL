Gastrointestinal function following esophagectomy for malignancy. The frequency and causes of gastrointestinal complications following esophagectomy for malignancy are unknown.We reviewed 295 esophagectomies performed for malignancy between January 1980 and September 1994 in order to determine the frequency and causes of early and late gastrointestinal complications.Compared to transhiatal and left thoracoabdominal esophagectomies, esophagectomies carried out through a right posterolateral thoracotomy with cervical esophagogastric anastomosis had a higher incidence of delayed gastric emptying (11%), pneumonia (26%), and hospital death (9%). The same operation had a higher incidence of gastroesophageal reflux (20%) and dysphagia requiring esophageal dilatation (53%). We found no independent effect of gastric drainage procedures, feeding jejunostomy, preoperative radiotherapy, pathology, or age on these outcomes. Women had no operative mortality, but a higher incidence of gastroesophageal reflux and diarrhea following esophagectomy.Surgical techniques aimed at improving gastric emptying following esophagectomy for cancer should improve operative morbidity and mortality.
