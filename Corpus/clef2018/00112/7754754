A case report of Stevens-Johnson syndrome with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. We encountered an 8 year old boy who suffered from Stevens-Johnson syndrome with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. He had multiple erythema with vesicles in oral mucosa, and on his palms and feet, trunk and genital regions. We treated him with prednisolone (1 mg/kg per day) and antibiotics. His skin lesions improved dramatically, and a persistent fever and toxic general condition also showed dramatic improvement. Although the use of corticosteroids for Stevens-Johnson syndrome has recently been controversial, we thought that administration of corticosteroids was an effective treatment for some selective cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome. The patient reported in this study had many beneficial effects in response to corticosteroid treatment.
