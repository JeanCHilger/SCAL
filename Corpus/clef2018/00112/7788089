Fulminant pneumonia caused by Streptococcus milleri: rare or not diagnosed?. Streptococcus milleri is increasingly isolated in laboratory samples and is worthy of consideration as a differential diagnosis in pyogenic infections, particularly in adults with underlying infections. We describe a well-documented case of pleuropulmonary infection in a young man with no known risk factors. We analyze the diversity of microbiological features of these bacteria in culture, as well as their clinical importance as pathogens.
