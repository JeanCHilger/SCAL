Lung complications during immunosuppressive treatment in renal transplant recipients. Pulmonary complications among 77 renal transplant recipients have been analysed. In the immediate postoperative period complications occurred with the same frequency as after other operations. Later on, usually within 6 months, pneumonia caused by bacteria, Pneumocystis carinii, cytomegalovirus and fungi occurred. The lung changes may indicate the underlying infecting organisms. Mortality from pneumonia was 14% (11/77) including two patients with lung aspiration following emergency surgery. Pulmonary complications were significantly higher in men.
