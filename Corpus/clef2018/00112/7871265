Mycoplasma infection with Stevens-Johnson syndrome and antiphospholipid antibodies: apropos of 2 cases. We report two cases of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections associated with Stevens-Johnson syndrome and antiphospholipid antibodies. Such an association has been noted once in the literature. The relationship between antiphospholipid antibodies and Stevens-Johnson syndrome and others cutaneous manifestations of infections diseases is discussed. Though mainly described in systemic lupus erythematosus and autoimmune diseases, anticardiolipin antibodies and lupus anticoagulant have been found in many infectious disorders. But in the latter conditions, they have been considered by many authors as "non pathogenic" or "non prothrombotic" on epidemiologic and immunologic data. We suggest that antiphospholipid antibodies could possibly play a role in their pathogenesis especially as the mechanisms are not to date clearly understood.
