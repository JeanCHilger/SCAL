Efficacy and safety of cefprozil versus other beta-lactam antibiotics in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections. Cefprozil was evaluated in four multicentre comparative studies in the treatment of acute respiratory tract infections. In two studies, cefprozil 500 mg q. 12 hours was compared to cefaclor 500 mg q. eight hours for ten days of therapy. Randomization was on a 2:1 (cefprozil:cefaclor) basis in the European centres and 1:1 in North America. The clinical efficacy in acute bronchitis was 88% (284 out of 324 patients) for cefprozil and 88% (183 out of 208) for cefaclor, with successful bacteriological eradication of the causative pathogen in 86% and 82% of the patients, respectively. Amongst the patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, the clinical response rate of 80% (59 out of 74) for cefprozil appeared superior to that of cefaclor at 62% (p = 0.067), whilst the bacteriological response rates were 62% (36 out of 58) for cefprozil and 74% (20 out of 27) for cefaclor. In pneumonia, the clinical response rates for cefprozil and cefaclor therapy were similar, 82% vs. 79%, although bacteriological eradication rates were better for cefprozil at 82% than for cefaclor at 71%. In the comparison of cefprozil with cefuroxime axetil, a total of 170 patients were evaluable. The clinical and bacteriological response rates for cefprozil of 95% and 100% were better than those for cefuroxime axetil 500 mg q. 12 hours of 84% and 75%, respectively. In the cefprozil vs. amoxicillin-clavulanate, 500 mg q. eight hours comparative study, the two antibiotics displayed no significant difference in clinical or bacteriological responses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
