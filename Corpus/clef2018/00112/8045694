The role of flexible bronchoscopy in children with AIDS: an update of the New York University experience. The clinical courses of children with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) who underwent diagnostic flexible bronchoscopy at Bellevue Hospital from 1987-1992 were reviewed to determine the value of the procedure in patient management. Twenty-eight children (age 13 days to 12 years) underwent 31 bronchoscopies for indications including respiratory distress, fever and abnormal chest radiograph. Procedures were well tolerated. Complications were limited to transient hypoxia and epistaxis. Although 58% of bronchoscopies yielded a diagnosis (Pneumocystis carinii, Streptococcus viridans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Cytomegalovirus, atypical mycobacterium, giant cell pneumonia, and mechanical obstruction), empiric medical therapy was altered in only 16% of cases. Bronchoscopic diagnoses are correlated with Centers for Disease Control (CDC) classification, immune status, treatment and outcome.
