The characteristics of the regulation of blood lipid peroxidation in acute pneumonia and acute pneumonia combined with diabetes mellitus. The changes in the levels of diene conjugates, Schiff bases and malonic dialdehyde were followed up in red blood cells and plasma of 178 acute pneumonia (AP), diabetes mellitus (DM) and AP+DM patients. The findings for AP and AP+DM were compared to acute-phase indices of the inflammation and clinical pattern. The blood of the patients was endovascularly exposed to low-energy He-Ne laser irradiation. The resultant trends in LPO were recorded. It is concluded that by changes in the concentrations of diene conjugates, Schiff bases and malonic dialdehyde one can judge on the course of the above diseases and evaluate efficacy of on-going treatments, eg. He-Ne laser, antioxidants.
