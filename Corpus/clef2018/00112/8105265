Increased soluble ICAM-1 in tracheal aspirates of infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Raised concentrations of soluble intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM-1) in tracheal aspirates from premature infants may predict development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). We measured sICAM-1 in tracheal aspirates and serum samples from 15 newborn babies (9 with BPD, 6 without BPD) at 2-4, 6-7, and 12-14 days of age. sICAM-1 concentrations in tracheal aspirates were significantly raised at 6-7 and 12-14 days of age in infants who later developed BPD compared with infants who did not develop BPD. Serum samples from the two groups did not differ significantly in sICAM-1. Raised sICAM-1 in tracheal aspirate was a good predictor of lung injury in infants who later developed BPD.
