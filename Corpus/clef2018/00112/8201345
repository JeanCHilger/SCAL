Anticentriolar autoantibodies in children with central nervous system manifestations of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. Serum samples from 49 children with acute Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection were screened for the presence of antibodies to mitotic spindle apparatus. None of these serum samples showed such antibodies at a screening dilution of 1:40, though anticentriolar antibodies at titres of 1:320 were observed in two children with acute cerebellar dysfunction. Anticentriolar antibodies may play a part in the pathogenesis of CNS disease associated with M pneumoniae infection.
