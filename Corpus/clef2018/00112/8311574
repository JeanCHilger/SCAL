Prevalence of complement-fixing antibodies to Mycoplasma pneumoniae in the savannah and forest belts of Nigeria. A survey of complement-fixing antibodies to Mycoplasma pneumoniae in 1673 children (aged 5-13 years) was conducted in Nigeria. Although the antibodies were detected in 25.7% of the children from the savannah belt and 20.4% of those from the forest belt, only 8.9% and 7.4%, respectively, had titres considered high enough to protect them from infection. The geometric mean titres (GMT) tended to increase with age up to 8 years and then gradually fall. The age-specific differences in GMT were significant (F = 2.98 analysis of variance with x = 0.05) but those due to the child's sex (F = 2.49) and belt of origin (F = 2.61) were not. The results indicate that Nigeria is a highly endemic area for M. pneumoniae infection, with a large pool of susceptible children in which epidemic outbreaks could occur.
