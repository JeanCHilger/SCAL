Characterization of V factor-dependent organisms of the family Pasteurellaceae isolated from porcine pneumonic lungs in Spain. 116 V factor (NAD)-dependent strains belonging to the family Pasterurellaceae isolated from porcine pneumonic lungs were collected in Spain over a period of 1 yr and studied using 52 biochemical characters. In addition to Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (72 strains), Haemophilus taxon minor group (37 strains) and Taxon D (four strains), other taxon (three strains) were observed. This taxon, provisionally designated as Haemophilus sp. sorbitol+, is closed to A. pleuropneumoniae but differed by some biochemical characteristics. Among A. pleuropneumoniae strains, nine different serotypes were detected, the most frequent being serotypes 4 and 2.
