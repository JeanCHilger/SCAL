The efficacy and tolerance of a three-day course of azithromycin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. The clinical efficacy and tolerance of a three-day course of azithromycin was evaluated in patients with community-acquired pneumonia in an open, non-comparative pilot study. Sixty-six patients with clinical and radiological findings of pneumonia were treated with a total dose of 1.5 g azithromycin (500 mg once-daily for three days).

Of the remaining 26 patients, 22 had no organisms isolated at baseline, and could only be evaluated clinically two patients were lost to follow-up
