The newborn chest. Newer therapeutic techniques in the respiratory management of preterm and full-term neonates have resulted in improved survival, particularly in those infants who have respiratory distress syndrome, severe pneumonia, and surgical lesions of the chest. Although respiratory distress syndrome is being seen less frequently because of improved ventilatory management and the use of surfactant replacement therapy, the increased survival of preterm infants has resulted in an increased incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, still a frequently seen pulmonary abnormality. Children who have severe pulmonary disease related to diaphragmatic hernia, meconium aspiration pneumonia, and infectious pneumonia are treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, resulting in a higher survival rate and better outcome. Other abnormalities of the lung, including pneumonia, are seen in both preterm and full-term infants, have characteristic radiographic appearances, and require prompt antibiotic treatment.
