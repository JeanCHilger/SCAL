Primary Candida pneumonia. Experience at a large cancer center and review of the literature. We reviewed the experience over 20 years with primary Candida pneumonia among fatal cancer cases at our hospital. Unequivocal evidence of primary Candida pneumonia has been reported in only 55 cases. We report here 31 such cases. Unlike patients with disseminated candidiasis, and contrary to previous studies concentrating on cancer patients, only 9 of our 31 patients had severe neutropenia. In this report, the lack of organ involvement other than the lungs at complete autopsy examination, the exclusion of patients with candidemia, the very high percentage of intrabronchial and intra-alveolar fungal involvement without vascular invasion, and the concomitant presence of candidal esophagitis in some patients suggest that the mechanism of entry of the infectious particles may have been aspiration of oropharyngeal contents. The major clinical manifestations of primary Candida pneumonia are fever and tachypnea. Radiologically, nonspecific patchy infiltrates can be seen. Histopathologically, there is prevalence of bronchopneumonia, hemorrhage, and necrosis. The only accepted criterion for the definitive diagnosis of Candida pneumonia is histologic demonstration of the fungus in lung tissue. In contrast to previous reports, we demonstrated that primary Candida pneumonia can be life-threatening in patients with cancer since it directly contributed to the death of 84% of the patients in the present series. Very little data are available on the therapy and outcome of patients with Candida pneumonia. However, primary Candida pneumonia in the compromised host should be treated as a life-threatening infection with systemic antifungal therapy.
