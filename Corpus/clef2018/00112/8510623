Liquid ventilation: a developing technology. Respiratory compromise remains a predominant problem of neonates in intensive care units, producing significant morbidity and mortality. Recent advances in therapy for these infants have focused on diminishing pulmonary inflation pressures. Liquid ventilation, a technique that has been extensively explored in animal models for over 20 years, may have a role in the treatment of pulmonary diseases. This technique utilizes perfluorochemical liquids, which are inert, clear, and odorless, and have a very high solubility for respiratory gases. Liquid ventilation has been studied in numerous animal species under many different conditions. Recent clinical trials have shown the feasibility and potential of this modality in human preterm neonates. This article reviews this technology specifically for the treatment of neonatal pulmonary disease. Potential advantages in respiratory distress and aspiration syndromes, persistent pulmonary hypertension, pneumonia, as well as other entities are discussed. The experience with liquid ventilation to date indicates that this technology may significantly benefit many neonatal lung diseases. Documentation of its efficacy and safety is necessary, however, before this modality will assume in clinical medicine.
