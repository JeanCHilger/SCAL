Pulmonary function tests in normal Indian children and changes in respiratory disorders. To document the normal values of pulmonary function tests in children and changes occurring in their values with various respiratory disorders, a study was carried over a period of one year in 95 healthy controls (39 females and 56 males) of 8-13 years of age and 51 cases with respiratory disorders (bronchial asthma-31, pneumonia-10, empyema-10) of matched age, sex and height distribution. The lung functions studied were FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC, PEFR and FEF25-75%. In children with bronchial asthma, the FEV1/FVC%, PEFR and FEF25-75% were reduced in accordance with the severity of the disease. A typical restrictive pattern of equivalent decrease in FVC and FEV1 along with insignificant lowering of flow rates, i.e., PEFR and FEF25-75% was observed in pneumonia whereas in patients of empyema a combined pattern of significantly decreased FVC and FEV1 along with mildly reduced FEV1/FVC%, PEFR and FEF 25 75% was observed.
