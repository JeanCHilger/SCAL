High resolution computed tomography of the lung in neutropenic patients with fever. To determine the sensitivity and clinical impact of high-resolution CT (HRCT) of the lung in febrile neutropenic patients under antibiotic therapy.Chest X-ray and HRCT were prospectively performed to exclude pneumonia in 34 patients (53 examinations) suffering from febrile neutropenia following antitumor therapy. Diagnosis was confirmed by bronchoalveolar lavage or sputum cultures.Chest X-ray showed pneumonia in 13/53 examinations, in 12/13 a micro-organism was found. HRCT demonstrated pneumonia in 39/53, in 31/39 a micro-organism was found. All cases with positive cultures showed suspicious HRCT findings. Changes in antibiotic treatment resulted in findings suspicious for pneumonia and evidence of a new or a just treated micro-organism (chest X-ray 8/53, HRCT 31/53) the search for the source of fever was escalated in cases without evidence of micro-organisms and without suspicion of pneumonia findings 14/53.HRCT of the lung exhibits a higher sensitivity than conventional radiographs. Findings resulted in relevant therapeutic consequences. Hence, HRCT is indicated in neutropenic patients with fever and inconspicuous chest X-ray.
