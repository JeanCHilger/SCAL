Performance of Meridian ImmunoCard Mycoplasma test in a multicenter clinical trial. Serology is the principal laboratory method used to diagnose Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. Meridian Diagnostics has developed the ImmunoCard Mycoplasma kit, a 10-min card-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) designed to detect immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to M. pneumoniae. We compared the ImmunoCard with two M. pneumoniae IgM-specific assays (immunofluorescence assay [IFA] and ELISA) and a standard complement fixation (CF) procedure using 896 specimens submitted to clinical laboratories for M. pneumoniae serology. Equivocal results obtained by CF, IFA, or ELISA were resolved by testing with an additional method or by reviewing patient chart information. The ImmunoCard had sensitivities ranging from 74% compared with the ELISA to 96% compared with CF results with IFA. ImmunoCard specificities ranged from 85% compared with the IgM-specific ELISA to 98% compared with IgM-specific IFA results resolved with clinical chart review. We also compared the ImmunoCard results with consensus results of 694 specimens tested on at least two non-ImmunoCard methods because of the lack of a "gold standard" for M. pneumoniae serology. Overall, the ImmunoCard Mycoplasma IgM assay had 90% sensitivity, 93% specificity, and 92% agreement with the consensus results. The ImmunoCard is technically less complex and requires less equipment that the three other assays. Our results indicate that the ImmunoCard Mycoplasma IgM assay is a valid and simple procedure which can reduce technologist time (and, thus, labor cost) and turnaround time for laboratories analyzing small numbers of specimens (< 10 per batch) submitted for IgM anti-M. pneumoniae testing.
