Effectiveness of control programs for pneumonia among children in China and Fiji. This article summarizes the implementation and efficacy of the World Health Organization's standard case management program for pediatric pneumonia in three counties in China and in the Western Division of Fiji. The information provided through this program was simple enough to be understood by parents and health care workers with a basic educational background. The program reduced mortality from pneumonia even when implemented through the existing health care system in a relatively poor county in China. The factors important in the success of the program included improved recognition of the signs of childhood pneumonia by parents, earlier presentation of children with these signs to health care facilities, availability of antimicrobial agents at the primary health care level, and rational decisions by health care workers about the use of these agents.
