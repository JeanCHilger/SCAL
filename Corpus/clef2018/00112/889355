Chemical pneumonitis secondary to inhalation of epoxy pipe coating. Two patients with chemical pneumonitis secondary to inhalation of an epoxy curing material used in the coating of pipes had similar patterns of cough, hemoptysis, and dyspnea associated with diffuse bilateral alveolar infiltrates shortly following the exposure. Pulmonary function studies showed a volume-restrictive defect with severe hypoxemia, but an elevated diffusing capacity. All lung function studies returned toward normal within 1 month of exposure. One patient underwent an open lung biopsy which showed changes consistent with a nonspecific injury to the alveolar wall. This epoxy curing material, trimellitic anhydride, represents another cause of diffuse lung injury that can result in pulmonary edema.
