Bacterial complications of primary varicella in children. Bacterial complications of varicella in 84 patients younger than 16 years of age (48 females median age, 2.9 years) who required hospitalization between 1985 and 1995 were retrospectively analyzed. The purpose of the study was to describe demographics, clinical manifestations, bacteriology, and factors affecting outcome. Seventy-six percent of patients were younger than 5 years of age. The eldest children in households were significantly underrepresented (P = .00025). Skin infections occurred in 61 patients (73%), and deep-seated infections and/or shock occurred in 23 (27%). The latter complications were significantly associated with thrombocytopenia (P = .011) and bacteremia (P = .014) at the time of admission, prolonged fever (P = .001), prolonged hospitalization (P < .0001), intensive care management (P < .0001), and fatal outcome (P = .019). Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (59% of isolates) and Staphylococcus aureus (28%) were the predominant isolates. Before and after 1990, five (31%) of 16 and 13 (62%) of 21 streptococcal complications, respectively, were invasive infections (P = .09). These data underscore the need for universal immunization against chickenpox.
