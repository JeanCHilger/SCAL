Resistance patterns of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae isolates recovered in Egypt from children with pneumonia. The Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Study Group. Treatment of childhood pneumonia in developing countries requires knowledge of susceptibility patterns for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Between October 1991 and April 1993, a surveillance survey of antimicrobial resistance was performed at two fever hospitals in Egypt nasopharyngeal swab and blood specimens obtained from 1,635 children with pneumonia were cultured for these organisms.
