Community-acquired pneumonia: the annual cost to the National Health Service in the UK. The aim of this study was to estimate the direct annual healthcare costs to the UK National Health Service (NHS) of managing community-acquired pneumonia. Using a prevalence-based burden of illness approach, health service resource use and corresponding costs attributable to the management of community-acquired pneumonia during 1992/1993 in the UK were obtained from published sources and commercial databases, and supplemented by a telephone survey of general practitioners, finance directors, community nurses, receptionists and nurses in out-patient respiratory clinics, ambulance services, and consultant respiratory physicians. The study was appraised by a Peer Review Panel, representing a cross-section of experts from different locations. This study was a predefined subgroup analysis of a previous, larger study that estimated the annual cost to the NHS of treating all community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections. The analysis shows that there are 261,000 episodes of community-acquired pneumonia annually in the UK, costing 440.7 million pounds at 1992/1993 prices (32% of the annual cost for all community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections). Approximately 83,153 annual cases of community-acquired pneumonia are treated in hospital (32% of all episodes) and account for 96% of the annual cost. The average cost for managing pneumonia in the community is 100 pounds per episode, compared to 1,700-5,100 pounds when the patient is hospitalized, depending on the length of hospitalization. Hospitalization accounts for 87% of the total annual cost. In conclusion, community-acquired pneumonia in the UK incurs a direct healthcare cost of 440.7 million pounds annually at 1992/1993 prices. Developing and implementing strategies to prevent and minimize hospitalization will significantly reduce this annual cost and should be assessed in future studies.
