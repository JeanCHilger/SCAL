Pulmonary complications in children with hematologic malignancies: accuracy of diagnosis with chest radiography and CT. To determine the diagnostic accuracy of chest radiography and computed tomography (CT) in patients with complications during treatment for hematologic malignancies.CT scans were obtained 1 week or less before bronchoscopic sampling or biopsy in 48 pediatric patients (age range, 8 months to 18 years at diagnosis) undergoing treatment for leukemia, lymphoma, or myeloproliferative disease. Radiographs were obtained less than 1 week before CT. Pulmonary complications comprised fungal (n = 11), viral (n = 4), and bacterial (n = 5) pneumonias cryptogenic organizing pneumonia ([COP] n = 4)Satisfactory diagnostic accuracy, defined by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, was noted for fungal pneumonia (radiography, ROC area = 0.82 CT, ROC area = 0.78), COP (radiography, ROC area = 0.75Radiography and CT have satisfactory accuracies for fungal pneumonia and COP. For these conditions, CT identified more true-positive cases than did radiography.
