Infections in paediatric renal transplant recipients. A retrospective study of all children who had undergone renal transplantation at the National University Hospital was undertaken in order to investigate the types and frequency of infections in paediatric renal transplant recipients. A total of 13 children ranging in age from 3 to 17 years were transplanted over a 7-year period from 1989 to 1996. The mean follow-up period was 40.5 months. Ten patients (77%) had at least one episode of infection post-transplant, 70% of which occurred within the first 6 months post-transplant. These infections included urinary infections (8), disseminated cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease (4), Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (1) and mycoplasma pneumonia (1). Urinary tract infections were significantly associated with the presence of ureteral stents. CMV disease was significantly associated with the use of mycophenolic acid in the early post-transplant period. Infection therefore continues to be a major cause of morbidity in paediatric renal transplant recipients.
