Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled clinical trial of efficacy of vitamin A treatment in non-measles childhood pneumonia. To evaluate the impact on clinical recovery and severity of the addition of large doses of vitamin A to the standard treatment for childhood pneumonia.A randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial.Study children were recruited at a public hospital in Recife, north east Brazil, an area of marginal vitamin A deficiency.472 children aged 6 to 59 months with clinical diagnosis of pneumonia.200,000 IU (infants) or 400,000 IU (1-4 year olds) of vitamin A in oil or similar capsules of placebo divided into two daily oral doses, in addition to the standard treatment.Duration of the episode and incidence of adverse outcomes.The groups were similar with respect to overall duration of pneumonia and incidence of adverse outcomes. Children who received vitamin A, however, were less likely to have fever by day 3 (P = 0.008) and were 29% less likely to fail to respond to the first line antibiotic (P = 0.054).There was little evidence for an effect of vitamin A treatment on the immediate outcome of the pneumonia episode.
