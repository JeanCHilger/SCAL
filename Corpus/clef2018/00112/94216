Pustulosis palmaris et plantaris: the value of routine radiographic examinations in the detection of an infectious focus. A three-year clinical material of 163 patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris is presented. The study was designed to assess the value of routine radiographic examinations of teeth, nasal sinuses and chest in the detection of an asymptomatic infectious focus. 66 patients underwent 151 examinations. Infectious lesions were found in the lungs of 0 of 53 examinations, inflammation in the nasal sinuses in 3 of 52 examinations (6%) , and abscesses at the teeth roots in 8 of 46 examinations (17%). The 3 patients with sinuitis had symptoms leading to the diagnosis. The root abscesses were all asymptomatic. Elimination of the infectious foci did not affect the course of the disease. The high incidence of asymptomatic tooth root abscesses is discussed. From studies on clinically healthy persons, similar results have been reported. It is concluded that routine radiographic examinations are of little or no value, possibly with the exception of the dental examination.
