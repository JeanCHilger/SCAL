Measles in pregnancy: maternal morbidity and perinatal outcome. In this article, we studied the maternal morbidity and the perinatal outcome of 40 women who had measles in pregnancy and that was compared to 120 women who had pregnancy without measles and 37 women who had measles without pregnancy.The medical records of all the case and control subjects were reviewed and significance was tested at the 5% level.The 40 cases of measles with pregnancy had significantly more hospital admission for pneumonia and fever when compared to cases of measles with no pregnancy (P < 0.001). The perinatal morbidity is significantly higher in cases of measles with pregnancy as expressed by the higher incidence of prematurity, neonatal hospital admission and length of stay in hospital (P < 0.003, P < 0.0005 and P < 0.0001, respectively).Formulation of an appropriate strategy utilizing the available resources for measles vaccination is mandatory.
