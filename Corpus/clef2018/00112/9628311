Recurrent Pseudomonas bronchopneumonia and other symptoms as in cystic fibrosis in a child with type I pseudohypoaldosteronism. We report a child with multiple target organ pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 with frequent recurrent pulmonary infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pasteurella multocida and high levels of chloride in sweat, urine and nasal secretion. Repetitive faecal chymotrypsin samples have all shown pathological values in spite of no other sign of exocrine pancreas dysfunction. The similarities with cystic fibrosis and the importance of the salt content in bronchial fluid are discussed.
