Vitamin A supplementation and severity of pneumonia in children admitted to the hospital in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Vitamin A deficiency and acute lower respiratory tract infections coexist as important public health problems in many developing countries. We carried out a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to examine whether large doses of vitamin A given to Tanzanian children who are admitted to the hospital with nonmeasles pneumonia would reduce the severity of respiratory disease. Six hundred eighty-seven children were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or vitamin A [200 000 IU (60 mg retinol equivalents) for children > 1 y of age and 100000 IU (30 mg retinol equivalents) for infants] on the day of admission and another dose on the following day. Of the 346 children in the vitamin A group, 13 died in the hospital, compared with 8 of 341 children in the placebo group the relative mortality was 1.63 (95% CI: 0.67, 3.97
