The diagnostic value of gram stain of bronchoalveolar lavage samples in patients with suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in intensive care unit patients. However, the diagnosis is quite difficult. Gram stain (GS) of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sample is a time-saving diagnostic method for VAP. However, its clinical significance has not been adequately investigated. The aim of this study was to determine its sensitivity and specificity for VAP diagnosis. We prospectively performed GS and quantitative bacterial cultures (QBC) of BAL samples, obtained through fiberoptic bronchoscope, in 75 consecutive postoperative and/or multiple trauma patients with suspected VAP. We considered BAL-GS as positive for VAP diagnosis when (i) polymorphonuclear neutrophils were > 25 per optic field at a magnification x 100 (p.o.f x 100) (ii) squamous epithelial cells were < 1% p.o.f x 100
