Laparoscopic cholecystectomy in cirrhotic patients. Reported mortality for open cholecystectomy in patients with cirrhosis ranges from 10% to 80%. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has gained acceptance in the general population and has become the procedure of choice for symptomatic cholelithiasis. We reviewed our experience with the use of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in this group.We did a retrospective review of the records of 25 consecutive laparoscopic choleoystectomy procedures performed on cirrhotic patients from May 1992 to July 1996.There were no mortalities in our group. All procedures were completed laparoscopically. Mean length of stay was 1.7 days (range, 1 to 8 days). Morbidity consisted of wound hematomas, pneumonia, and ascites for a rate of 32%. Only patients with Child's Class A and Class B cirrhosis were operated on.Laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be performed safely in cirrhotic patients with well compensated liver function.
