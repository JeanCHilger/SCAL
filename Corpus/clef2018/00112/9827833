Non-invasive continuous positive airway pressure in acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure--experience of an emergency department. Non-invasive continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) seems to decrease the need for intubation in patients with severe cardiogenic pulmonary oedema (CPO) in the intensive care unit. The goals of our study were to delineate indications for CPAP in the emergency department, and to confirm its usefulness in such a setting. We retrospectively assess the evolution of all patients ventilated under CPAP for an acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure over a 1-year period (n = 64 patients). Hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis were present in most patients with CPO (PaCO2 = 54.4+/-22.3 mmHg pH = 7.27+/-0.13), according to respiratory exhaustion, although initial PaCO2 was low in the pneumonia group. There was a significant improvement of arterial blood gases after 1 hour of ventilation in the CPO group (PaO2 = 254.1+/-121.0 mmHg
