Macrolide antibiotics. Macrolide antibiotics are considered the drug of choice for many clinically significant infections in children, including mycoplasma pneumonia, chlamydial infections, pertussis, and campylobacter enteritis. In addition, they are frequently the first alternative in patients allergic to penicillin. Therefore, they are medications with which pediatric nurses should be familiar. Although effective antibiotics, some of the macrolide antibiotics have an extensive drug interaction profile. It is imperative that pediatric nurses be familiar with these drug interactions to safely treat their patients.
