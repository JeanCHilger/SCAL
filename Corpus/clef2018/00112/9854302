Neisseria meningitidis W135 pneumonia with sepicaemia in a nonogenarian. Neisseria meningitidis infection is generally considered a disease of children or young adults, classically presenting as meningitis or sepicaemia. This infection is rare but recognised in the elderly. We present the case of a nonogenarian with meningococcal pneumonia and sinusitis with bacteraemia caused by N.meningitidis W135 a rare serogroup. We therefore thought this unusual situation of interest and worthwhile reporting.
