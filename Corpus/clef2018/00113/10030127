Ketoprofen and phenylbutazone attenuation of PAF-induced lung inflammation in calves. The purposes of this study were: (1) to investigate which arachidonic acid metabolites contributed to platelet-activating factor (PAF) induced pulmonary dysfunction and (2) to compare the effect of two non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, phenylbutazone and ketoprofen in a model of PAF-induced reversible lung inflammation in six calves. In placebo and phenylbutazone groups, PAF infusion induced significant dysfunctions in the pattern of breathing, mechanics of breathing and gas exchange. These dysfunctions were prevented by ketoprofen pretreatment, except for the mechanics of breathing which was moderately but significantly altered by the PAF challenge. In all calves, leukotriene (LT) B4 plasma concentrations did not significantly increase above baseline values at any time. Prostaglandin (PG) E2 plasma concentrations showed a minor significant increase in phenylbutazone pretreated calves (55.8 +/- 25.8 pg/mL from 36.7 +/- 16.13 pg/mL). Thromboxane (TX) B2 plasma concentration was significantly increased during PAF challenge in placebo- and phenylbutazone-pretreated groups, but not in ketoprofen-pretreated calves (1580.0 +/- 1370 from 42.7 +/- 10.7 pg/mL
