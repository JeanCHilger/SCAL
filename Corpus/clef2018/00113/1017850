Lysosomal proteinasen and peptidasen in serum of children with inflammatory diseases (author's transl). In the serum of 43 children the activities of proteinases and peptidases by mean of 41 substrates have been determined in order to get knowledge of overall activities and differentiation of lysosomal proteolytic enzymes. Proteinases, cathepsins A, B, C and D, aminopeptidases, carboxypeptidases, dipeptidases, tripeptidases and aminoacidarylamidases have been checked. The enzyme pattern of the serum of a collective of 15 healthy children or those without serious clinical signs is demonstrated, also the alterations and differentiations in the serum of children with leucemia, pneumonia, inflammatory diseases of the respiratory tract, other inflammatory diseases and common diseases. Leucyl-glycyl-glycyltripeptidase, glycyl-glycyl-glycyltripeptidase, a proteosterase, carboxypeptidase A, a neutrale proteinase and basic proteinase (cathepsin B) and cathepsin C are increased. A distinct elevation has been found only in children with leucemia and pneumonia.
