Markers of pulmonary inflammation in tracheobronchial fluid of premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome. To asses the role of pulmonary inflammation in the outcome of preterm neonates with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) we measured soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), interleukin-8 (IL-8), eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF beta 1) in tracheobronquial lavage (TBL) fluid of 15 preterm infants 9/15 completely recovered from RDS and 6/15 developed chronic lung disease (CLD). ICAM-1 (p: 0.001) and TGF beta 1 (p: 0.04) levels increased in TBL fluid during the first days of life. The values of ICAM-1 were correlated to the days of 0(2) and mechanical ventilation dependency. At 3 days of age, ICAM-1 levels in TBL fluid were higher in infants who later developed CLD compared to infants without CLD (24.5 vs 8.3 micrograms/ml
