Bloodstream, respiratory, and deep surgical wound infections after open heart surgery. Nosocomial infections are one of the most feared complications after open heart surgery. A large retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the nature and scope of the problem. Between 1992 and 1998, 9352 patients who had undergone open heart surgery were evaluated. Bloodstream infections, pneumonia, and deep sternal wound infections were included. Univariate and logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the high-risk patients that were likely to become infected. Three hundred forty-six infections in 276 patients were diagnosed. Age, preoperative albumin level, banked blood requirement, duration of operation, diabetes mellitus, previous open heart surgery, moderate or severe pericardial adhesions, obesity, postoperative low cardiac output, and postoperative cerebrovascular accident were found to be significant in univariate and logistic regression analyses for infectious outcome. Univariate analysis also revealed additional significant factors: fresh frozen plasma requirement, duration of cardiopulmonary bypass and cross-clamp, preoperative high levels of blood urea and glucose, presence of occlusive peripheral arterial disease, preoperative history of hypertension, and nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus. Methicillin resistant S. aureus was involved in 58.4% of the infections. Risk factors should be individualized for patients and every effort should be carried out to minimize infectious outcome.
