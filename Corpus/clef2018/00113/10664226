Plasma concentrations of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-6 in septic and healthy preterms. Plasma granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentrations were determined in 21 preterm infants with sepsis and nine healthy preterm neonates of the same postnatal age at sampling. Plasma GM-CSF levels were elevated at diagnosis in the septic preterms as compared to the healthy preterms (P = 0.01), but did not differ significantly on recovery. IL-6 levels were also elevated markedly at diagnosis (P = 0.0003), but decreased to normal on recovery as compared to the healthy preterm infants. GM-CSF levels were more prominent in septic preterms with neutropenia than those of non-neutropenic infants (P = 0.03).Preterm infants can produce high levels of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-6 in response to bacterial sepsis.
