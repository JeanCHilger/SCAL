Prospective validation of a standardized questionnaire for estimating childhood mortality and morbidity due to pneumonia and diarrhoea. This paper reports the validation of a 'best-judgement' standardised questionnaire using guidelines and algorithms developed by an expert working group conducted in Nicaragua between 1995 and 1997. Prospective hospital data, including standardised medical recording of selected signs and symptoms, laboratory and radiographic test results and physician diagnoses were collected for children < 5 years admitted with any serious life-threatening condition in 3 study hospitals. The mothers or caregivers of the children were later traced and interviewed using the 'best-judgement' questionnaire. Interviews were completed 1-22 months after admission to hospital for 1115 children (400 who died during the stay in hospital and 715 who were discharged alive). The cause of death or admission to hospital was determined by an expert algorithm applied to hospital data. A similar procedure was used to derive the cause using the answers to questions from interviews. Hospital causes were compared with interview causes and sensitivity and specificity calculated, together with the estimated cause-specific fraction for diarrhoea and pneumonia. Multiple diagnoses were allowed 378 children in the sample (104 deaths, 274 survivors) had a reference diagnosis of diarrhoeal illness, and 506 (168 deaths, 338 survivors) a reference diagnosis of pneumonia. When results for deaths and survivors in all age groups were combined, the expert algorithms had sensitivity between 86% and 88% and specificity between 81% and 83% for any diarrhoeal illness
