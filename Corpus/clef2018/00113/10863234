Cavitating pulmonary infiltrate in an adolescent with pyoderma gangrenosum: a rarely recognized extracutaneous manifestation of a neutrophilic dermatosis. Neutrophilic dermatoses such as pyoderma gangrenosum are characterized by sterile, neutrophilic cutaneous infiltrates. Extracutaneous neutrophilic infiltrates can occur, primarily in the joints, lungs, heart, central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, and eyes. Pulmonary disease is the most frequently reported extracutaneous manifestation of pyoderma gangrenosum and is characterized by patchy infiltrates or interstitial pneumonitis. We describe an adolescent with typical pyoderma gangrenosum who presented with cavitary pneumonia and responded completely to oral corticosteroids. In patients with inflammatory ulcers, extracutaneous neutrophilic disease should be considered, once an infectious process has been excluded.
