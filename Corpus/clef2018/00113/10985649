Case management of childhood pneumonia in developing countries: recent relevant research and current initiatives. Acute respiratory infections (ARI), mostly pneumonia, are one of the leading causes of death in young children in developing countries, accounting for 28% of childhood mortality. This paper provides a summary of the research and technical development efforts made in the last 15 years which contributed to improving the effectiveness of the case management strategy to reduce mortality from pneumonia in children in developing countries. Community intervention studies provided strong evidence that the strategy was feasible and effective in producing a substantial impact on pneumonia mortality. Clinical studies provided the rationale for improving the sensitivity and specificity of key signs of pneumonia, and for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of standard home treatment. Research also provided data to deal with the problem of the clinical overlap of pneumonia and malaria in children. Technological initiatives succeeded in making appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic devices available. An important body of socio-cultural knowledge about family practices regarding pneumonia and ARI in children was built up and provided orientation on effective communication between health workers and families about home care of children with ARI. Health systems research focused on methods for surveillance of bacterial drug resistance and methodologies for evaluating the control programmes. Despite advances in the development of vaccines against respiratory bacteria and in the prevention of risk factors for pneumonia in children, case management will continue to be a central strategy for preventing mortality. Current international research initiatives are looking into measures that can improve the referral of severe pneumonia and effective management of severe pneumonia at first level hospitals.
