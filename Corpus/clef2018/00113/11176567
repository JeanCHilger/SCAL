Seroetiology of acute lower respiratory infections among hospitalized children in Beijing. Little is known of the etiology of childhood acute lower respiratory infections in China, where the use of antimicrobials is indiscriminate. Trials to change such a policy require etiologic data, especially on the bacteria most relevant to these common diseases.One hundred consecutive infants and children from 3 months to 14 years of age with symptoms and signs compatible with acute lower respiratory infections were studied prospectively in the largest pediatric hospital in Beijing from February to May, 1997. Blood culture, thorax radiography and paired sera for 20 microbiologic assays were taken, and the course of illness was monitored uniformly. Disease severity was graded.In 24 cases there was evidence only of bacterial etiology, and in 5 solely viral agents were found 3 children probably had a mixed bacterial-viral infection. Surprisingly no pneumococcal infection was detected, Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n = 21), Haemophilus influenzae type b (n = 8) and Chlamydia pneumoniae (n = 7) being the dominant bacteria. All children recovered.Routine use of antimicrobials for these patients seems unjustified. Serologic evidence for the H. influenzae type b etiology is encouraging in terms of vaccination, but confirmatory studies are needed.
