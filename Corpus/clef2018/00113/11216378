Spectrum of respiratory distress in very low birthweight neonates. The incidence, etiology and the outcome of respiratory distress in 243 consecutive liveborn very low birth weight neonates (VLBW) were analysed. One hundred and forty six (60%) VLBW neonates developed respiratory distress. Hyaline membrane disease, congenital pneumonia and transient tachypnea of the newborn were the major underlying causes (35.6%, 28.1%, and 27.4% respectively). The mortality rate was significantly higher in neonates with respiratory distress (72 of 146, 49.3%) than in those without distress (28 of 97, 28.8%) (p < 0.05). This difference was more sharply reflected in the 1000-1249 birth weight group and in the 29-32 weeks gestation group. Respiratory distress is a significant determinant of VLBW mortality.
