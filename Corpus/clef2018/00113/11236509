Microbiocenosis of the large intestine in acute complicated pneumonia in children. Fifty-six children of early age with pneumonia developed on the background of frequent respiratory infections were placed under observation. In 91.1% of these cases microecological disturbances in the intestine were detected, 46.6% of the patients having third-degree dysbacteriolysis. In such cases it is more correct to regard the "intestinal" syndrome as the clinical manifestation of disturbances in the biocenosis of the intestine, the state of its microflora. Intestinal dysbacteriosis aggravates the course of acute aggravated pneumonia in children and requires the inclusion of special therapy aimed at normalizing intestinal microflora.
