Endobronchial inflammatory pseudotumor of the lung. Inflammatory pseudotumor (also called plasma cell granuloma, histiocytoma and x-anthofibroma) is a benign, slow growing lesion which may present with cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis and unresolving pneumonia or can be discovered radiographically as a localised lesion. It has been reported in individuals up to 70 years old, but approximately two-thirds have developed in individuals under 30 years of age. The sex incidence is approximately equal. Inflammatory pseudotumors of the lung are usually peripheral lesions but may occasionally be endobronchial. We report the case of an endobronchial inflammatory pseudotumor in a 17-year-old girl who presented with unresolving right-sided pneumonia. Appropriate radiological, bronchoscopic and histopathological investigations lead to accurate pre-operative diagnosis and early complete surgical resection through a limited right main bronchus incision (bronchotomy). The patient made good postoperative recovery and an excellent prognosis is anticipated.
