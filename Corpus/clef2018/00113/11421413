Plasma levels of interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 in preterm neonates evaluated for sepsis. In a prospective study, plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 45 premature neonates (25-34 weeks gestational age) with signs and symptoms of suspected sepsis at 0, 12 and 24 h C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured at 0-24 h after enrolment. Six subjects were excluded due to insufficient blood sampling. The remaining 39 neonates were assigned to one of three groups: 25 newborns with sepsis (blood culture positive), seven with pneumonia (positive results on broncho-alveolar lavage fluid culture and characteristic chest radiography) and seven with necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) (characteristic intestinal and radiological signs according to the criteria of Bell et al.). A group of 20 healthy preterm neonates represented control subjects. On admission, higher levels of IL-6, IL-10 and CRP were observed in neonates with sepsis: IL-6 (median 1500 pg/ml, range 487-10000 pg/ml), IL-10 (median 113 pg/ml, range 70-196 pg/ml), CRP (median 22 mg/l, range 4-80 mg/l)Preterm neonates with sepsis, pneumonia or necrotising enterocolitis showed increased interleukin-6, interleukin-10 and C-reactive protein levels. High interleukin-10 concentration was associated with mortality and could be an early indicator of prognosis.
