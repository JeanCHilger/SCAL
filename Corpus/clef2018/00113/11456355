Serum interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha concentrations in children with mycoplasma pneumonia. A prospective study was performed to assess the relationship among interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, C-reactive protein serum concentrations, and the severity of mycoplasma pneumonia in 49 children. Mycoplasma pneumonia was diagnosed by chest film and anti-Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM antibody test. Serum concentrations of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were measured by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Interleukin-6 serum levels in mycoplasma pneumonia patients with fever for more than 3 days (41.98 +/- 67.46 [SD] pg/mL) were significantly higher than those in patients with fever < or = 3 days (10.01 +/- 11.74 pg/mL, p < 0.05). Interleukin-6 serum levels in those patients whose chest films revealed patchy consolidations or pleural effusion (58.11 +/- 92.19 pg/mL) were significantly higher than those in patients whose chest films revealed peribronchial interstitial infiltration (15.94 +/- 20.81 pg/mL, p < 0.05). The mean levels of serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha were not statistically significant in the different duration of fever and chest film findings. These results suggest that interleukin-6 serum concentration, rather than tumor necrosis factor-alpha, may be a potential indicator of the severity and outcome of mycoplasma pneumonia.
