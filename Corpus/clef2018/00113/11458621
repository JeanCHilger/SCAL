Ventilator-associated pneumonia with circuit changes every 2 days versus every week. Frequent ventilator circuit changes are expensive and sometimes unnecessary. Following the worldwide trend to lengthen the intervals for ventilator circuit change from 2 days to 1 week, this study aims to assure that low rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) can be maintained with cost containment.Ventilator circuits were routinely changed every 7 days in the study period for 2 years and every 2 days during the historical control period of another 2 years. Pediatric patients (age less than 15 years) were not included. Nosocomial pneumonia was diagnosed by the criteria of the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States (US). VAP was identified by combining and comparing 2 databases from the Respiratory Therapy Department and the Infection Control Unit of our hospital.In the study group, 225 episodes of pneumonias were observed in 7,068 patients and 87,338 ventilator days. The rate of VAP was 2.58 per 1,000 ventilator days. There were 174 episodes of pneumonia in 6,213 patients and 65,467 ventilator days of the control group. The rate of VAP was 2.66 per 1,000 ventilator days. The difference between both groups was not significant (p = 0.803). Yet, the cost curbed was around 80,000 US dollars per year.Extending ventilator circuit change interval from 2 days to 7 days do not increase the risk for VAP, but the cost savings for labor and supply are substantial.
