Mycoplasma Pneumoniae infection in Malaysian children admitted with community acquired pneumonia. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is increasingly recognized as an important cause of community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children. We determined the importance of M. pneumoniae as a causative agent in 170 children aged 1 month to 15 years who were hospitalized with CAP over a 6-month period. The diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection was based on serological evidence obtained by a particle agglutination test (SERODIA-MYCO II). A positive serological diagnosis was made if the acute phase serum titer was more than 1:160 or paired samples taken 2-4 weeks apart showed a four-fold or greater rise in the serum titer. M. pneumoniae was identified as the causative agent in 40 (23.5%) children. Children with M. pneumoniae infection were more likely to be older than 3 years (OR 4.0 95%CI 1.8-9.1, p<0.001), Chinese (OR 4.3 95%CI 2.0-8.9, p<0.001), have a duration of illness longer than 7 days prior to admission (OR 6.0 95%CI 2.7-13.5, p<0.001) and have perihilar interstitial changes on chest X-ray (OR 4.6 95%CI 2.2-9.9, p<0.001). A significant number of hospital admissions for CAP in Malaysian children can be attributed to M. pneumoniae. It is important to identify these children so as to administer the most appropriate antibiotic treatment.
