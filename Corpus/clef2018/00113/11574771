Chemotherapy for a patient with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer during pregnancy: a case report and a review of chemotherapy treatment during pregnancy. Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in women in the USA. Lung cancer arising during pregnancy is rare and has been reported only 15 times since the 1950s. However, the use of chemotherapy for lung cancer during pregnancy has not previously been reported.The history, treatment and outcome of a patient with stage IV non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) diagnosed during pregnancy is presented. Previous published reports on lung cancer were retrieved by a literature search of Medline and Cancerlit.A 31-year-old woman was diagnosed as having stage IV NSCLC with bilateral pulmonary involvement when 26 weeks pregnant. Her shortness of breath progressed to dyspnea at rest on 100% inspired oxygen. Therefore, she was treated with systemic chemotherapy using cisplatin and vinorelbine. Despite this treatment, her oxygenation declined further over the next 4 days and thus the baby was delivered via cesarean section after 27 weeks of gestation. Four cycles of vinorelbine and cisplatin have now been administered. Following this treatment, the patient has experienced a significant clinical improvement and no longer requires supplemental oxygen. No chemotherapy-related adverse effects have been noted in the baby. In the 15 previously reported patients with concurrent lung cancer and pregnancy, chemotherapy administration during pregnancy has not been described.Treatment of lung cancer with chemotherapy during pregnancy should be considered on an individual basis with regard to the stage of the cancer and the maturity of the fetus. To our knowledge, the case presented here is the first report of a woman receiving chemotherapy for lung cancer while pregnant.
