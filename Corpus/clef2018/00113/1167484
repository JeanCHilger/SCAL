Complications and total care of a child with acute leukemia. The complications which occur in a child with acute leukemia depend on the stage of the disease and the therapeutic regiman. Most children will present with some manifestation of marrow failure. An occasional child will have marked leukocytosis and disturbance of organ function due to massive leukemic infiltrates. Metabolic disturbances such as hyperuricemia and hyperphosphatemia-hypocalcemia may develop, expecially after therapy is initiated. The myelosuppression and immunosuppression due to drug toxicity may result in opportunistic infections. Other toxicities which can occur with a chemotherapeutic regimen are numerois and varied, and the physician must be cognizant of them in order to minimize damage. Therapy to the central nervous system, either for subclinical or clinical disease, has been associated with a variety of symptoms ranging from meningismus to paraplegia and death. To prevent the development of these complications, and to manage them effectively if they occur, the physician must be knowlegeable about their etiology, clinical and laboratory manifestations, and treatment.
