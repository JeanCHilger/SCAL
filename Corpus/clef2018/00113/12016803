Retrospective analysis of severe infection complicated with acute respiratory distress syndrome in children confirmed by autopic reports. A retrospective review was made on 9 children (7-day to 14-month old) suffering from serious pneumonia complicated with acute respiratory distress syndrome and septicemia. The main clinical manifestation was continuous and serious hypoxemia, which was hard to treat, but PaCO2 was not increased obviously. The failure of multiple organs is not only a common complication, but also is a common cause of death. Consecutive observation of chest X-ray photograph is helpful to the diagnosis as the disease gets worse. Autopsy is still an important way to improve the knowledge of diseases in clinical diagnosis.
