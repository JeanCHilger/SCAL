Lung abscess due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae in an adolescent. Pulmonary abscess is an uncommon complication of pneumonia in children. Pyogenes, in particular Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae are the principal responsible bacteria. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is rarely the cause.A 14-year-old child was hospitalized with right thoracic pain. The patient was non-febrile and had a recent history of moderate infection. He was receiving antibiotic (macrolide) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy. CT scan confirmed a mid-lobe abscess in the right lung. Interruption of therapy resulted in fever and increase in C-reactive level with hyperleucocytosis, suggesting that the abscess was caused by a bacterial infection. The child's general condition and the radiographic picture improved with combined antibiotic therapy with amoxycillin and clavulanic acid, aminoglycosides and macrolides. The suspected diagnostic of M. pneumoniae was confirmed by increased IgM antibodies for M. pneumoniae. Recovery was complete two months later without sequelae.Pulmonary abscess is a rare complication of M. pneumoniae infection in children. This complication should be considered when the general condition does not improve despite appropriate early treatment of a pneumonia, as in the case of our patient.
