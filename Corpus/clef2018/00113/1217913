Smoking and respiratory illness in military recruits. The effect of smoking on respiratory illness was investigated at a naval recruit camp. All recruits entering training during an 11-month period, beginning in February 1971, were included in the study. Questionnaires in regard to smoking habits were administered on arrival and during the last week of training. Facts of illness were obtained from each recruit's health record during the last week of training and abstracted onto electronic accounting machine (EAM) cards. Data on a sample of 1,100 men, who had complete records, were analyzed. Two thirds of the men were smokers on arrival. Heavy smokers had a longer history of smoking. The majority of recruits decreased smoking during training. Significantly more heavy smokers than light smokers or nonsmokers had symptoms of chronic respiratory involvement. No statistically significant increases in respiratory illness were observed in smokers.
