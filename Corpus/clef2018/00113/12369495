Maternal perception of pneumonia in children: a health facility survey in Enugu, eastern Nigeria. In a health facility-based study to determine the knowledge of mothers regarding recognition of pneumonia in their pre-school children, 400 women were interviewed using a pre-tested structured questionnaire. Sixty-one per cent of them would recognise pneumonia by difficult breathing, 42% by fast breathing and 26.5% by severe cough. Few of the mothers mentioned signs suggestive of 'chest indrawing' (8.5%) and 'central cyanosis' (1%). The maternal knowledge score on pneumonia signs increased significantly with educational status and social class (p < 0.05). While a substantial number of mothers (51%) perceived fast breathing to be an indication of severe pneumonia, a sizeable number (87.5%) were unsure if late signs such as chest indrawing and central cyanosis suggested severe disease. On the basis of the WHO criteria, it is concluded that maternal recognition of pneumonia in children is at best modest while knowledge of signs indicating severe disease is poor. These findings underscore the need to modify the WHO criteria to include difficult breathing and to highlight during local ARI health education campaigns that late signs such as chest indrawing and central cyanosis indicate severe and potentially fatal pneumonia.
