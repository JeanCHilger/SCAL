Cefditoren, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin. Cefditoren pivoxil, an oral third-generation cephalosporin, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in September 2001. It has been used in Japan for several years. The greatest therapeutic potential of cefditoren appears to be its activity against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms causing respiratory tract infections and skin and skin-structure infections, such as Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Cefditoren is also effective against methicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Nevertheless, cefditoren has no activity against atypical pathogens, including Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella sp. Moreover, cefditoren does not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Bacteroides fragilis. In virtually all studies, cefditoren has compared favorably against other orally administered antibiotics used against the most commonly isolated respiratory tract pathogens. Its side effect profile includes diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headache, and dyspepsia. Cefditoren is indicated for treatment of mild-to-moderate acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, pharyngitis-tonsillitis, and uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by susceptible strains of organisms in adults and adolescents (> or = 12 yrs of age). Based on its reported antimicrobial activity, cefditoren has potential for empiric management of most commonly encountered respiratory tract infections. Additional studies will further define its role in clinical practice.
