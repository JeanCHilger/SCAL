The histopathology of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in an organ culture of adult human lung. A study was made of histopathology of the organ cultures of the lung of 3 adult men infected with the FH, Erfurt and No. 13M. pneumoniae strains. Morphological changes in the infected tissue of the lung were characterized by affection of the cells of the alveolar lining and epithelium of the bronchi, moderate destruction of the interstitial tissue and formation of eosinophilic inclusions characteristic of M. pneumoniae infection. No. 13 strain caused a more intensive degeneration of the lung tissue than FH and Erfurt strains. The strains of M. pneumoniae under study reproduced in the organ culture of the human lung with sufficiently high titres (10(6)--10(8) colony-forming units/0.2 ml).
