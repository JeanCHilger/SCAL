Linezolid versus ceftriaxone/cefpodoxime in patients hospitalized for the treatment of Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia. Intravenous (i.v.) to oral linezolid (600 mg twice daily for both, with optional aztreonam) and a cephalosporin regimen (i.v. ceftriaxone 1 g twice daily followed by oral cefpodoxime 200 mg twice daily) were compared for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), with emphasis on patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae. This multicenter, randomized, open-label trial was conducted in 27 countries in 6 continents. Efficacy was assessed 12-28 d following treatment. Clinical and laboratory safety assessments were evaluated isolates for microbiologic assessments were identified primarily by sputum or blood culture. In all treated patients (linezolid, n = 381
