Efficacy and tolerability of once-daily telithromycin compared with high-dose amoxicillin for treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. This randomized, double-blind study compared the efficacy and tolerability of the new ketolide antimicrobial telithromycin with that of high-dose amoxicillin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).Adult patients (n = 404), with signs and symptoms of CAP and radiologic confirmation were randomized to receive telithromycin 800 mg once daily (n = 199) or amoxicillin 1,000 mg three times a day (n = 205) for 10 days. Clinical and bacteriologic outcomes were assessed at post-therapy test-of-cure (days 17-24) and late post therapy (days 31-36).The clinical cure rate for telithromycin-treated patients (per protocol) pst therapy (days 17-24) was 141/149 (94.6%) and compared well with that for amoxicillin (137/152 (90.1%)). Subset analysis of patients (per protocol) showed high clinical cure rates for patients aged >/= 65 years (telithromycin 21/24, 87.5% amoxicillin 22/29, 75.9%)Telithromycin 800 mg once daily is a convenient, optimal-spectrum, first-line treatment for CAP in adults, at least as effective and well tolerated as high-dose amoxicillin.
