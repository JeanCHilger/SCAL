Oral gemifloxacin versus sequential therapy with intravenous ceftriaxone/oral cefuroxime with or without a macrolide in the treatment of patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia: a randomized, open-label, multicenter study of clinical efficacy and tolerability. This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of oral gemifloxacin, an enhanced-affinity quinolone, with sequential therapy with IV ceftriaxone followed by oral cefuroxime (with or without a macrolide) in patients hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).A randomized, open-label, multicenter study comprised adults hospitalized with a clinical and radiologic diagnosis of CAP. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either (1) oral gemifloxacin 320 mg once daily (7-14 days) or (2) IV ceftriaxone 2 g once daily (1-7 days) followed by oral cefuroxime 500 mg twice daily (1-13 days) for a total of < or = 14 days. Patients receiving ceftriaxone/cefuroxime were allowed concomitant macrolide treatment.A total of 345 patients were randomized, of whom 341 received at least 1 dose of study medication (gemifloxacin, 169/172 ceftriaxone/cefuroxime, 172/173). Clinical success rates in the clinically evaluable (CE) population at follow-up (day 21-28 post-therapy), the primary end point, were 92.2% (107/116) for gemifloxacin and 93.4% (113/121) for ceftriaxone/cefuroxime (treatment difference, -1.15The clinical efficacy and tolerability of oral gemifloxacin 320 mg once daily were similar to those of IV ceftriaxone followed by oral cefuroxime (with or without a macrolide) in the treatment of adult patients hospitalized with moderate to severe CAP. Both treatments were effective in bacteremic patients and those at increased risk of mortality.
