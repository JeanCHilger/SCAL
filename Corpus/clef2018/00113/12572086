The role of atypical pathogen: Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae in the acute respiratory infection in childhood. The recent microbiological advance has revealed the importance of atypical pathogens such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila as common causes of acute bronchitis and community-acquired pneumonia. We found a third of community-acquired pneumonia in childhood were caused by M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae like western countries and there were many dual infections than expected. Therefore we have to treat patients with community-acquired pneumonia in always thinking about the role of atypical pathogens. This article summarizes the epidemiology, specific clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of these important organisms in the pediatric populations.
