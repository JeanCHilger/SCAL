Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia with a tumorous shadow on chest radiography--a case report. A 16-year-old woman was admitted with a 1-week history of increasing cough and fever. Chest radiography and computed tomography revealed a tumorous shadow in the right upper lung field. Serologic testing provided evidence of a Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. The clinical findings did not improve after 3 days of minocycline treatment, or after another 3 days in which levofloxacin was administered in combination with minocycline. The patient gradually improved after treatment with erythromycin replaced the minocycline treatment. This was a rare case of Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia with a tumorous shadow in the chest radiograph.
