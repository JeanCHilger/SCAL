HIV and respiratory infections in children. Respiratory disease is a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality in children infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This review highlights recent data and developments that relate to the impact of HIV on respiratory infections particularly in African children. Autopsy and clinical studies continue to show that bacterial pneumonia and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) are common respiratory infections and causes of death in regions where antiretroviral therapy and PCP prophylaxis are not routinely practiced. Recent studies of Zambian and South African children showed that pulmonary tuberculosis is more common in HIV-infected children than was previously recognized. The trial of bacterial conjugate vaccines in Johannesburg will provide important information of efficacy in an HIV endemic population. Prospective clinical descriptive and intervention studies are needed from different regions to guide clinical management and prevention of respiratory infections in HIV-infected children living in resource-poor countries.
