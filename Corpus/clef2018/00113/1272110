Infection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae: clinical and serological data on 286 patients. In a 14-month period from January, 1971, 286 patients, referred for investigation of a variety of illnesses, were found to have complement-fixing antibodies to Mycoplasma pneumoniae to a titre of 1:32 or greater. Clinical findings in these patients are presented in a form which relates them to different antibody levels. Patients with central nervous system disease are described in some detail and the occurence of rash, arthropathy and a variety of other syndromes is noted. The suggestion is made that low-titred M. pneumoniae antibody appears as an anamnestic response to infection with other agents.
