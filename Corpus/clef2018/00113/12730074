Neutrophil adhesion molecule expression in the developing neonatal rat exposed to hyperoxia. Neonatal rats have an increased tolerance to hyperoxia, which is associated with a diminished pulmonary inflammatory response compared with adults. To investigate this differing response, expression of the neutrophil adhesion molecules, L-selectin and CD18, and levels of soluble L-selectin, were examined using flow cytometry and sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on air-exposed neonatal rat neutrophils at 0-24 and 72 h and 7, 10, 14, and 21 d of age compared with the adult and after exposure to hyperoxia (>/= 98% O2) for 56 h in adults and for 72 h and 7 d in neonates. Expression of L-selectin in 0-24-h neonates was similar to adults, but was significantly lower than adults at 72 h and 7 d (P = 0.011). Soluble L-selectin levels were significantly higher than those in adults in the 0-24- and 72-h neonates (P < 0.001). CD18 expression in unstimulated and activated neutrophils of neonatal rats was higher at 0-24 h than in the adult (P < 0.001), but thereafter did not differ from adults. After hyperoxic exposure, L-selectin did not differ between the exposure groups but soluble L-selectin tended to increase in neonates after 7 d of O2 exposure Finally, CD18 was significantly higher after hyperoxic exposure of the adult (P = 0.008), but did not change with oxygen exposure in the neonate. Based on these findings, we speculate that differences between neonatal and adult rats in expression of L-selectin may contribute to delayed oxygen toxicity in neonatal rats.
