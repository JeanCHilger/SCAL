Linezolid: in infants and children with severe Gram-positive infections. Linezolid is an oxazolidinone antibacterial agent that has inhibitory activity against a broad range of Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The systemic clearance and, therefore, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve and elimination half-life of linezolid change with increasing age in pediatric patients. With the exception of pre-term neonates aged <1 week, systemic clearance is more rapid in pediatric patients aged 0-11 years than in adolescents. The pharmacokinetic profile of linezolid is similar in adolescents and adults. Linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in the treatment of pediatric patients with Gram-positive infections (clinical cure rate 89.3% vs 84.5%), and as effective as cefadroxil in the treatment of children and adolescents with Gram-positive uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections (91.0% vs 90.0%) in the clinically evaluable population of two randomized, comparator-controlled trials. The clinical cure rate with linezolid was 92.4% in a noncomparative trial in hospitalized pediatric patients with community-acquired pneumonia. All patients with proven pneumococcal pneumonia were considered cured. Linezolid is generally well tolerated. The most common drug-related adverse events in the comparator-controlled trials were diarrhea, nausea, and headache most events were mild to moderate in severity.
