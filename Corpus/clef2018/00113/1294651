Culture-positive Legionella pneumonia in Japan, 1980-1990. Working Party for Legionellosis, Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare. The Working Party for Legionellosis headed by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare processed to standardize the diagnostic procedures for Legionella pneumonia, as the first step to clarify the actual occurrence of patients with this respiratory disease. All the clinical data were collected and analysed on the 28 culture-confirmed patients in Japan during the past 11 years, from 1980 through 1990. The 28 patients were distributed throughout Japan, from Hokkaido to Kyushu. Out of 28 patients, 18 were community-acquired and 10 were nosocomially infected. In 8 of 18 community-acquired patients, any significant underlying disease was not observed. Though it was dominant in the age group in their 60s & 70s, victims were distributed in adults over 20 years of age and even in a new born baby. Only 5 out of 28 patients recovered successfully. From the autopsy findings, in 5 out of the remaining 23 expired patients, Legionella pneumonia seemed to be successfully treated, but other disease or other bacterial pneumonia put an end to the patients. The results of clinical laboratory tests and the efficacy of antibiotics to Legionella pneumonia were essentially the same as those reported in the literature.
