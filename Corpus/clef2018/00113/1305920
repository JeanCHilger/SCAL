Evaluation of usefulness of OWD and OIEP in diagnosis of epidemically occurring infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Blood serum samples of 3593 persons clinically suspected of infection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae were tested. Of these, patients with pneumoniae constituted 66.5%, upper respiratory tract infection--24.0% and with symptoms localized outside the respiratory system--9.5%. These studies were performed by application of complement fixation test (OWD) and immunoelectroprecipitation (OIEP) methods, accepting as a diagnostically significant--titer 1:60 or higher and/or occurrence in OIEP reaction with serum diluted 1:2 or more. Among patients studied prevailed children in the age of 3 to 16 years (61.6%). Mycoplasmosis was detected in these patients in 1071 out of 2236 cases (47.9%). Compatible results in both tests were obtained in 90.6% patients, whereas OWD only in 3.0% and OIEP only in 6.4% cases. Simultaneous application of both tests increased detectability of infections caused by M. pneumoniae by 3% in relation to OIEP and by 6.4% in relation to OWD.
