Bleomycin-induced pulmonary function abnormalities. The usefulness of serial PFTs in identifying patients who are developing BIP was assessed in 59 men with non-seminomatous testicular carcinoma. The mean age was 27.7 years and all the patients received a standard three-course chemotherapy regimen consisting of vinblastine, bleomycin, and cis-diamminedichloroplatinum. The average dose of bleomycin was 555.5 units. Serial PFTs, chest roentgenograms, and medical assessments were done prior to each course of bleomycin. Nine (15.3 percent) patients developed pulmonary symptoms due to bleomycin and 23 (39 percent) had significant changes on chest x-ray films. The Dsb dropped significantly with bleomycin treatment therefore, it is the most sensitive indicator of pulmonary response to bleomycin. However, the Dsb failed to differentiate patients with BIP from those without. The TLC was found to be a much more specific indicator of BIP because reduction in TLC correlated with the development of pulmonary symptoms and roentgenologic changes.
