Plasma fibronectin determination in acute bacterial pneumonia. Plasma fibronectin (PFn) level was measured with immunoelectrophoresis in 40 healthy adults and 30 patients with acute bacterial pneumonia. The results showed that PFn was considerably lowered in acute bacterial pneumonia (214.49 +/- 77.84 micrograms/ml) when compared with that of healthy controls (292.48 +/- 43.11 micrograms/ml), (P less than 0.001). In the pneumonia group (10 severe cases) the level of PFn was significantly lowered than that in the moderate or mild cases (127.45 +/- 31.03 micrograms/ml vs. 255.11 +/- 54.16 micrograms/ml), (P less than 0.001). In 11 cases of recovering pneumonia, PFn was significantly higher than that in exacerbation period (213.13 +/- 41.32 micrograms/ml vs. 154.52 +/- 51.27 micrograms/ml) (P less than 0.001). We think that PFn level is helpful to evaluate the clinical course and prognosis of acute bacterial pneumonia.
