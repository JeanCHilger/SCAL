Detection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in clinical samples from pediatric patients by polymerase chain reaction. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique was used to detect Mycoplasma pneumoniae DNA in clinical samples (nasopharyngeal aspirations or bronchoalveolar lavages) obtained from 100 children, 1 month to 16 years old. PCR allowed the detection of M. pneumoniae DNA from 20 out of the 100 patients studied. In 16 cases, PCR positivity was associated with acute respiratory symptomatology. For five PCR-positive patients, a positive culture or a serological response evidenced acute M. pneumoniae infections. A lack of antibody response was observed particularly with immunocompromised children and infants less than 12 months old. The amount of M. pneumoniae DNA in the PCR was estimated in a semiquantitative way by comparison of its hybridization signal with those obtained for 100, 10, and 1 color-changing unit (CCU) of the M. pneumoniae FH strain. Small amounts (less than or equal to 10(2) CCU/ml) of M. pneumoniae were found in samples from asymptomatic patients, while larger amounts (greater than or equal to 10(2) to greater than or equal to 10(4) CCU/ml) were found for 8 out of 10 patients with acute pneumonia.
