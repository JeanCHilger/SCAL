New approaches to evaluation of the inflammatory process in the bronchi of children with bronchopulmonary diseases. Examination of patients, that included investigation of the clinical, endoscopic and laboratory parameters over time formed the basis for estimating bronchial inflammation. As many as 164 children with recurrent and chronic bronchopulmonary diseases were examined. The authors provide the informative signs allowing one to judge the activity of bronchial inflammation with a high accuracy (up to 90-95%). The complex signs that characterize bronchial inflammation, grades I, II and III, are also provided. The all-round estimation of the inflammatory activity makes it possible to objectively differentiate the status of local homeostasis, which is of paramount importance for administration of adequate and effective therapy.
