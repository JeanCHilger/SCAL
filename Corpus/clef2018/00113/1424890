Pneumonia due to Haemophilus influenzae among mechanically ventilated patients. Incidence, outcome, and risk factors. Incidence and potential risk factors for pneumonia due to Haemophilus influenzae in adults treated with mechanical ventilation in a medical-surgical ICU were investigated. Diagnosis was established in 91 episodes and H influenzae was isolated in 20 of them. Mean onset of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to H influenzae was 10.8 days after intubation. Six patients with H influenzae VAP died in the ICU. Of 13 risk factors for developing VAP due to H influenzae, an absence of prior antibiotic treatment was the only variable which had statistical significance (p < 0.001). In these mechanically ventilated patients, Haemophilus influenzae was a common causative agent for VAP, frequently associated with Gram-positive cocci. Episodes of H influenzae VAP were associated with a lower mortality compared with other etiologies. The epidemiologic and clinical findings indicate that patients without a prior antimicrobial treatment have increased susceptibility to infections of the airway by H influenzae.
