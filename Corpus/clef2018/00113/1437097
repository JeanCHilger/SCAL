Significance of leukocytes and bacteria in the gastric aspirate from neonates. The cytological pictures of the gastric aspirates of 2582 newborns were evaluated by a semiquantitative method. A high number of germs was found in the majority of the early onset sepsis and pneumonia (19/22). In the late onset and local connatal infections were found no significant cytological abnormalities. A high number of germs was a rare finding in the healthy newborn population (11/2456).
