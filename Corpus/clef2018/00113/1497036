Experience with mepivacaine paracervical block in an obstetric private practice. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of mepivacaine paracervical block in term, low-risk obstetric patients.Over a 3-year period all term, low-risk obstetric patients in the author's private practice were offered mepivacaine paracervical block anesthesia. One hundred eighty-two patients received 200 mg mepivacaine with each block. The patients who declined paracervical block were used as a control group to compare Apgar scores, subject to chi 2 analysis.Initial injections were 97.3% successful. Average duration of anesthesia was 59.7 minutes with the first injection. Fetal bradycardia occurred in 13.2% with an average duration of 4.5 minutes. The slightly higher incidence of low Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes in the study group was not statistically significant. One neonatal death occurred secondary to group B streptococcal sepsis in the study group.Mepivacaine paracervical block remains an anesthetic option in low-risk patients. The high success rate is limited by its short duration of action and the incidence of fetal bradycardia.
