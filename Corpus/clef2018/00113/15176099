Efficacy and safety of cefoperazone/sulbactam in the treatment of children with mucoviscidosis during exacerbation of the bronchopulmonary process. The use of cefoperazone/sulbactam in combination with amikacin in the treatment of 20 patients with mucoviscidosis and exacerbation of bronchopulmonary pathological process resulted in marked positive dynamics of the clinical and functional indices of the lungs state. The bacteriological effect with respect to the main pathogens in the cases of mucoviscidosis was strain-dependent: eradication of 10 (83.4%) out of 12 Staphylococcus aureus strains and only 3 (15.8%) out of 19 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. The most frequent adverse reaction was diarrhea (5 children) successfully corrigated by loperamide. Discontinuation of the drug use was required in 3 patients because of macrohematuria (1 child) and allergic eruption.
