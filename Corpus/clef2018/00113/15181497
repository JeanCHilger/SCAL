Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection presenting as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and acute hepatitis in a child. Extrapulmonary manifestations of Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia are uncommon and include hematologic, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, dermatologic, and neurologic complications. We report a case of serologically-confirmed M. pneumoniae infection complicated by severe neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and hepatitis. The presence of antiplatelet and antineutrophil antibodies suggested that these autoantibodies caused the cytopenias. The disease had an acute course and the patient recovered after steroid treatment. This case indicates that neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and hepatitis are possible clinical manifestations of M. pneumoniae infection.
