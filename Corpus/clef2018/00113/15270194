Pulmonary infiltrates during chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia: incidence, patterns and outcomes. To analyze the incidence, etiologies, radiographic patterns, and clinical outcomes of adult leukemics with prolonged febrile neutropenia and pneumonia.A retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital. The medical records of adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia diagnosed between January 1989 and June 2000 and undergoing induction chemotherapy were included. Only the patients who presented with a pulmonary infiltrate, secondary leukemia (e.g., transformed chronic myeloid leukemia underlying myelodysplastic syndrome, or disease following alkylating agent therapy) were included and those developing infiltrates following consolidation chemotherapy were excluded.A total of 124 patients were admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of AML during the study period. Thirty-one patients were excluded 93 patients received induction chemotherapy and were included in the study analysis. The median age was 36 years (15 - 70 years)Neutropenia occurred at a mean of 5.0 after initiation of induction chemotherapy. The majority of patients had bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Male sex, onset of neutropenia and bilateral distribution of an infiltrate were found to be statistically significant predictors of early mortality.
