Miller Fisher syndrome possibly related to mycoplasma pneumoniae infection: report of one case. Ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia were first described in 1956 by Miller Fisher and later were referred to as symptoms of Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS). This syndrome shares certain features with the Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (GBS), including areflexia, cerebrospinal fluid findings and often a postinfectious presentation. It was believed to be a variant of GBS, but Miller Fisher syndrome has several key clinical features which differ from GBS. The anatomic location and pathogenesis of MFS continue to be a matter of debate. Our report focuses on a 6-year-old female patient who developed MFS following a respiratory tract infection with a serologically proven Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. Although several neurological complications after Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection have been reported, subsequent MFS development has rarely been reported previously.
