A profile of respiratory symptoms in urban and rural South Australian school children. This report describes the cross-sectional analyses of data from the first year of a longitudinal study using questionnaire and respiratory function data over a 5 year period from a sample of rural South Australian school children. The cumulative or lifetime prevalences of respiratory symptoms were estimated in 825 rural and 1261 urban school children aged between 5 and 15 years in order to determine if the prevalence rates differed between rural and urban school children. The study found the overall cumulative prevalence of asthma and/or wheezy breathing (AWB) to be 24.1% in the rural school children compared to 27.6% in the urban school children. Most children developed AWB symptoms before the age of 7 years, with 20% reporting moderately severe symptoms and 10% having more than one attack per fortnight. The cumulative prevalence of bronchitis, loose/rattly cough (BLRC) differed significantly between the rural school children (34.1%) and urban school children (47.9%). The BLRC symptoms preceded the development of AWB in many cases. Urban school children also reported a higher prevalence of atopic conditions.
