Utility of bronchoalveolar lavage in immunocompromised children: diagnostic yield and complications. Immunocompromised children are at high risk for developing pneumonia due to opportunistic pathogens. The role of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in the evaluation of such patients is still controversial.We reviewed the hospital records of immunosuppressed patients with respiratory symptoms who had undergone BAL in the pediatric department of the Hospital Clinico de la Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica of Chile.Sixty-eight BAL were performed on 54 children (mean age: 7.5 years) receiving wide-spectrum antibiotic treatment. The most frequent respiratory signs and symptoms were fever (90%) and cough and respiratory distress (81%) 18% had neutropenia and 43% thrombocytopenia. A specific pathogen was identified in BAL samples for 25 patients (37%). The pathogens isolated were bacteria in 21 cases, viruses in 6, Pneumocystis carinii in 5, fungi in 4, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis in one. Fourteen (19%) of the children who underwent BAL were on mechanical ventilation. Outcome was satisfactory in all cases. Twenty-one complications were recorded, 17 of which were minor (mild hypoxemia or fever) and 4 major, requiring tracheal intubation. No deaths were recorded.Evaluation by fiberoptic bronchoscopy together with BAL proved to be a safe procedure with an adequate diagnostic yield that made it possible to determine the etiology of the pulmonary infiltrates seen in chest x-rays. Both positive and negative results of BAL were useful for treating the patients.
