Cutaneous vasculitis revealing a Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a bacterial agent that must be evoked when confronted with cutaneous vasculitis, notably within a context of fever and inflammation, and despite the absence of respiratory symptoms.A young 16 year-old boy was hospitalised for cutaneous vasculitis with fever but without respiratory symptoms. A recent M. pneumoniae sero-conversion was revealed.M. pneumoniae is an intra-cellular pathogen responsible for 20 to 35% of community-acquired pneumonia in adults. The absence of respiratory symptoms in M. pneumoniae infection is not uncommon. Extra-pulmonary complications of M. pneumoniae infections are frequent and varied, notably dermatological. Cutaneous vasculitis associated with M. pneumoniae is seldom found in the medical literature. It is reported as immune-complex -mediated vasculitis or Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Cutaneous eruptions are dominated by maculo-papular rashes and multiform erythema.
