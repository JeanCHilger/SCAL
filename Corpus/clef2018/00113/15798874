Non-typable Haemophilus influenzae severe pneumonia in an infant: case report. Haemophilus influenzae b (Hib) disease used to be a frequent cause of pneumonia in children. After the widespread use of Hib conjugate vaccines, non-b H. influenzae have become an important cause of pneumonia. We present the case of an infant with severe pneumonia with empyema and bacteremia after he had completed the Hib vaccination schedule. Non typable H. influenzae was recovered from blood and pleural effusion cultures. We review the literature about this unusual clinical presentation in our community and alert about the possible emergence of non typable H. influenzae as a frequent cause of community-acquired pneumonia in children.
