Correlation between cough frequency and airway inflammation in children with primary ciliary dyskinesia. Cough is common in airway disease. We measured cough frequency in children with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), to determine how accurately families assess this symptom and to assess the relationship between cough frequency and airway inflammation, measured using induced sputum and exhaled nitric oxide (eNO). Twenty stable PCD children (7 boys), median age 10.8 years (interquartile range (IQR), 9-14), and 10 healthy control children, median age 12 years (IQR, 10.5-12.7), were recruited. ENO was measured using a chemiluminescence analyzer, with sputum induction with 3.5% saline. PCD children underwent ambulatory cough monitoring. Sputum neutrophils were higher in PCD (median, 70.3%
