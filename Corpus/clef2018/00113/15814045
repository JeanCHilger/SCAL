Can clinical signs predict hypoxaemia in Papua New Guinean children with moderate and severe pneumonia? Pulse oximetry was performed on 77 children admitted with acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRI) to the children's ward in Port Moresby General Hospital, Papua New Guinea over a 4-month period in 2002. Clinical findings were correlated with different levels of hypoxaemia, <93%, <90% and <85%. Cyanosis, head nodding and drowsiness were good predictors of hypoxia but lacked sensitivity. Decisions to use oxygen based on these signs would therefore result in a significant number of children with hypoxia not receiving oxygen. Pulse oximetry is the best indicator of hypoxaemia in children with ALRI and, although relatively expensive, its use might be cost-effective in controlling oxygen requirements.
