Development of the incidence of pneumonia in the autonomous community of Valencia throughout the 1995-2001 period. A retrospective study. To know development pneumonias throughout 1995 to 2001.The data source was obtained from the database of the Minimum Basic Data Set. We selected three pneumonia hospitalized causes in the Community of Valencia, Bronchopneumonia, and Pneumonia for not specified organism and invasive pneumococcal disease. It was realized the statistical analysis by SPSS programme. Calculating the pneumonia incidence rate and its time development and observing the interactions between age group, genre, mean of age, stay in the hospital and origin.The incidence for the period was 209 per 100,000 people, that increased significantly until it stabilized in 1999. The pneumonia affected more frequently men than women and specially aged 65 years or more. For age the pneumonias are more frequent in subjects younger than 5 and older than 65, (maximum 76-77 years old). It was observed statistically significant differences between provinces. The stays on hospital was greater for men and this ground with age groups, this is longer in people 65 years old or older. The average stay depending on the aged groups but do not exist statistically differences between genre and age group.Pneumonia is a pathology originated from different causes, it affect principally men and more especially at younger than 5 years and older than 65 years. The incidences stabilizing on the studied period last years. This works must be continued for clarify if it is the same way for the development by the different pneumonias types on this time period and if exists the interactions between the different variables.
