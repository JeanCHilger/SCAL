Candidosis and aspergillosis as autopsy findings from 1994 to 2003. We analysed the autopsy records of the Greifswald University Institute of Pathology (located in Eastern Germany) in respect of findings of candidosis and aspergillosis from 1994 to 2003. We also present eight immature aborted fetuses and premature infants with a mycosis. In a total of 2027 autopsies we found 164 cases of invasive candidosis and aspergillosis (8.1%) including a combination of both on four occasions. Other authors cited between 0.7 and 7.3%. In these 10 years in our material mycoses and in particular candidosis increased in spite of slightly decreased numbers of autopsies. The differences comparing the 5-years periods (1994-98 and 1999-2003) are highly significant for both mycoses and candidosis. They are not significant for aspergillosis. A similar relationship was observed in the distribution of mycotic organs and causative origin for candidosis alone. In the last 5 years the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts, including the peritoneum, were more frequently infected by Candida. Non-haematological neoplasia and pneumonia as basic diseases more often appeared in cases of candidosis. All eight immature aborted fetuses and premature infants suffered from candidosis. The survey confirms the importance of autopsy as a tool for education and quality control in medical diagnostic and therapeutic activity in the field of mycoses, too.
