Mycoplasma pneumoniae, community-acquired pneumonia and asthma. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is an intracellular pathogen, devoid of cell wall, able to invade airway epithelial cells. Infection may either remain asymptomatic or induce bronchitis and pneumonia. M. pneumoniae is the first-ranking aetiological agent of community-acquired pneumonias in children over five years of age. Clinical features are usually mild, but this should not preclude the initiation of a treatment, in order to avoid serious sequelae such as impairment of pulmonary gas exchange capacity. In children at high-risk of asthma, infection with M. pneumoniae can induce exacerbation. A survey was performed in children admitted to hospital Saint-Vincent-de-Paul (Paris) for an episode of severe asthma exacerbation with persistent hypoxemia. Mycoplasma infection was identified in 26% of children with a history of asthma and 50% of those for whom the exacerbation was the presenting manifestation of the disease. Furthermore, if the Mycoplasma infection was atypical, asthma exacerbation recurred within one month. M. pneumoniae should be considered not only as a preeminent agent of respiratory infection in children, but also as a triggering factor in exacerbation and even inception of asthma. As a consequence, it is mandatory to carefully search for and actively treat Mycoplasma infection in children.
