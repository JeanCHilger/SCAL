Intervention models for the management of children with signs of pneumonia or malaria by community health workers. A systematic review was conducted to categorize and describe Intervention Models involving community health workers (CHWs) that aim to improve case management of sick children at the household and community levels. The review focused on management of children with signs of malaria or pneumonia. Seven Intervention Models were identified, and classified according to: (1) the role of CHWs and families in assessment and treatment of children, (2) system of referral to the nearest health facility (verbal or facilitated), and (3) the location in the community of the drug stock. Standardization of terminology for Intervention Models using this or a similar classification could facilitate comparison and selection of models, including deciding how to modify programmes when policies change concerning first-line drugs, and setting priorities for further research. Of the seven models, that of CHW pneumonia case management (Model 6) has the strongest evidence for an impact on mortality. Pneumonia case management by CHWs is a child health intervention that warrants considerably more attention, particularly in Africa and South Asia.
