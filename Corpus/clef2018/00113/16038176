Hafnia alvei in a rare case of severe pneumonia in a postanesthesia recovery unit. An 85-year-old man with a history of moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in treatment with anticholinergic drugs was admitted to the recovery unit for postoperative monitoring after right inguinal herniorrhaphy surgery and removal of a strangulated intestinal section. On the third day after surgery the patient developed radiographic signs consistent with pneumonia and required mechanical ventilation. Two blood cultures and a respiratory secretion sample grew a microorganism identified as Hafnia alvei. H. alvei is a gram-negative bacillus that colonizes the digestive tract of humans and animals and in immunodepressed patients it can colonize the mouth and pharynx. Isolation of H. alvei is described in the literature on pediatric patients and those with a history of immune deficiency or chronic disease. Infection has a severe impact on general health. We report a rare and interesting case of pneumonia and bacteremia from H. alvei infection acquired by an immunocompetent patient soon after arrival in the postoperative recovery unit. The patient died of the infection.
