Stroke in two children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. A causal or casual relationship? We report on 2 children who had a stroke biologically related to Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. Invasion of the central nervous system and an immune mechanism represent 2 pathogenesis pathways. Prompt macrolide therapy does not prevent stroke, but immediate and aggressive immunosuppressive treatment seems to help recovery.
