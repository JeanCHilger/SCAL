Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Experience of a tertiary hospital in Spain. To describe the epidemiological, clinical, microbiological, neuroimaging and laboratory features, treatment, and outcome in a cohort of children with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM).Retrospective chart review was performed of children with a diagnosis of ADEM over a 23-year period in a tertiary hospital in Spain.Twelve cases were identified. Ten cases (83%) occurred after 1992. Nine patients (75%) presented between April and September. The mean age was 6 years. Nine patients (75%) were male. Fifty percent of the patients had a history of infectious disease or vaccination. The most frequent nonspecific symptom was fever in 75%. The most frequent neurological manifestations were motor deficits and altered consciousness in 75%. Cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities were found in 83%. All patients had at least one brain scan and one brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Three patients underwent spinal MRI. The sensitivity of MRI was greater than that of the scanner in the diagnosis of ADEM. An etiologic diagnosis was made in four patients: Mycoplasma pneumoniae, beta hemolytic streptococcus group A, Epstein-Barr virus and measles-mumps-rubella vaccination. Eleven patients were treated with corticosteroids and one was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. One patient died while 75 % of the patients had a good outcome.ADEM is in an infrequent disease in children. The clinical features are similar to those of infectious encephalitis. Etiologic diagnosis is difficult to establish but this entity is usually preceded by an infection. The neuroimaging test of choice to establish the diagnosis is MRI. In most patients, the prognosis is good.
