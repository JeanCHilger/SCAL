Acute severe spinal cord dysfunction in a child with meningitis: Streptococcus pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae co-infection. Tetraplegia developed abruptly in an 11-y-old with pneumococcal meningitis. Magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple hyperintensities at the brainstem-spinal cord junction. Serological tests were positive for Mycoplasma pneumoniae (microparticle agglutination and specific IgMs). Erythromycin and dexamethasone were started promptly, and 10 d later the patient was discharged with normal neurological function.Tetraplegia during the course of pneumococcal meningitis in an 11-y-old girl disappeared after treatment with ceftriaxone, erythromycin and dexamethasone.
