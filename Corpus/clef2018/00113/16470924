Viraemia and extraintestinal involvement after rotavirus infection. To study the incidence of viraemia and extraintestinal organ damage in children with acute rotavirus (RV) gastroenteritis.Eighty-three children with acute rotavirus gastroenteritis were hospitalized from October 2002 to March 2003, whose blood and fecal samples were obtained on admission. Rotavirus RNA (encoding the VP7 outer capsid protein) were detected in blood and fecal samples by nest reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). According to the result of blood RV-RNA, the patients were divided into RV-RNA positive group and RV-RNA negative group. The differences between these two groups in the severity of gastroenteritis and extraintestinal organ damage were analyzed.Eighty-two of 83 stool samples from the children with rotavirus infection were positive for rotavirus RNA. Sixteen of 83 blood samples were positive for rotavirus RNA with a positive rate of 19.3%. The nucleotide sequence of cloned cDNAs, resembling part of the VP7 gene, was identical from paired blood and fecal samples. There were no significant differences between blood RV-RNA positive group and blood RV-RNA negative group in the rate and degree of fever, diarrhea, dehydration, metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia and myocardial damage (P>0.05) while the incidences of liver damage, rash, lower respiratory tract infection and the central nervous system involvement in the blood RV-RNA positive group were significantly higher than those in the blood RV-RNA negative group (P<0.05).Viraemia is present in the children with acute rotavirus gastroenteritis. Viraemia might be an important mechanism by which rotavirus spread to the extraintestinal sites resulting in organs damage.
