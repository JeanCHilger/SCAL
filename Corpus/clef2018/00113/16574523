Airway infectious disease emergencies. Upper and lower respiratory infections are encountered commonly in the emergency department. Visits resulting from occurrences of respiratory disease account for 10% of all pediatric emergency department visits and 20% of all pediatric hospital admissions. Causes of upper airway infections include croup, epiglottitis, retropharyngeal abscess, cellulitis, pharyngitis, and peritonsillar abscesses. Lower airway viral and bacterial infections cause illnesses such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis. Signs and symptoms of upper and lower airway infections overlap, but the differentiation is important for appropriate treatment of these conditions. This article reviews the varied clinical characteristics of upper and lower airway infections.
