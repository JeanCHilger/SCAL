Autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in a patient with relapsed pleuropulmonary blastoma. Pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB) is a rare and aggressive primary intrathoracic neoplasma of children. The prognosis is extremely poor with frequent metastasis to the brain and bone. We present a 4-year-old girl with a tumor mass in the right hemithorax initially diagnosed as pneumoniae. Tumor resection was performed and the histologic report indicated the diagnosis of PPB. The patient received chemotherapy comprising vincristine, actinomycin D, doxorubicin, cisplatin, and cyclophosphamide. Irradiation was performed with total 45 Gy at the right lower pulmonary lobe. She relapsed 29 months later at the pleura between the right middle and lower pulmonary lobe. Tumor resection and total 45 Gy of irradiation were performed again. High-dose chemotherapy comprising cisplatin, adriamycin, and cyclophosphamide was performed followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). The patient achieved complete hematologic recovery. Thirty-one months after PBSCT, no signs of relapse have been observed. Although it might be that the patient could have been cured with second surgery alone or by the surgery and subsequent chemotherapy, high-dose chemotherapy and PBSCT should be considered for the treatment of relapsed PPB.
