Therapeutic analysis of stereotactic radiotherapy for 39 patients with lung metastasis. There are only a few traditional treatment methods for lung metastasis, and the therapeutic effectiveness is not satisfactory. X-ray stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) is developed as a new treatment option of lung metastasis in recent years. This study was to summarize the efficacy of SRT on lung metastasis.A total of 39 patients with 62 lung metastatic lesions were treated by SRT in Cancer Center of Sun Yat-sen University. The median maximum diameter of the targets was 2.1 cm (1.2-4.9 cm), and the median maximum volume of the targets was 1.4 cm(3) (0.3-16.9 cm(3)). Of the 62 lesions, 21 were irradiated by single fraction with a dose of 20-24 Gy, and 41 were irradiated by 2-4 fractions with a dosage of 8-16 Gy/fraction and a total dose of 24-45 Gy. The median biologic effective dose (BED) of all lesions was 75 Gy (52.8-112.5 Gy).Response rate was 83.3% at 3 months after treatment. For the lesions with maximum diameter of < or =3 cm, the response rates were 62.5% for BED<75 Gy and 93.5% for BED> or =75 Gy (P=0.023). Median survival time was 21.6 months (3.4-62.2 months). The 1-year and 2-year overall survival rates, local control survival rates and progression-free survival rates were 78.9% and 48.2%, 88.4% and 82.8%, 65.0% and 39.3%, respectively. The 2-year overall survival rate was significantly higher in the subgroup with single lung metastatic lesion than in the subgroup with multiple lung metastatic lesions (57.7% vs. 30.0%, P=0.047), and significantly higher in the subgroup without metastasis in other organs than in the subgroup with metastasis in other organs (54.9% vs. 28.6%, P=0.003). The occurrence of radiation pneumonitis (> or =grade 2) was 5.1% (2/39).SRT is an effective and safe treatment for lung metastasis. The patients with single lung metastasis and without metastasis in other organs have better survival. BED> or =75 Gy has better local control effect on lung metastasis with maximum diameter of < or =3 cm.
