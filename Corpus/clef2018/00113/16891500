Genetic diversity of PspA types among nasopharyngeal isolates collected during an ongoing surveillance study of children in Brazil. Pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) has been considered a potential candidate for human vaccines because of its serotype-independent protective immunity. Nasopharyngeal (NP) pneumococcal colonization is highly prevalent in infants and precedes the invasive disease. Thus, prevention of NP colonization may reduce the burden of pneumococcal disease in children. Scarce information focusing on PspA from pneumococcal carriage in humans is available. We examined the genetic diversity of PspA from NP isolates obtained during an ongoing pneumococcal surveillance study with children. PspA families and clades of 183 community-acquired Streptococcus pneumoniae NP isolates from healthy children (n = 97) and children with respiratory tract infections (n = 48), pneumonia (n = 33), or meningitis (n = 5) were investigated. Overall, 79.8% (n = 146) of the pneumococcal isolates were classified as PspA family 1 (35.5%) and family 2 (44.3%), whereas 20.2% of the isolates could not be typed. The distribution of PspA families and clades did not differ significantly according to the clinical status of the children. A dendrogram comparing the genetic relationship between the amino acid sequences of the clade-defining region of PspA from NP strains together with 24 invasive reference strains (GenBank) closely reproduced the profile of the families and clades previously reported for pneumococcal invasive strains. These findings strengthen the idea that the use of PspA as a vaccine antigen may protect children against carriage as well as invasive pneumococcal disease.
