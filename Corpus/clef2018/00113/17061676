Rigid ventilation bronchoscopy under general anesthesia for treatment of pediatric pulmonary atelectasis caused by pneumonia: A review of 33 cases. Pediatric pulmonary atelectasis caused by pneumonia is a common disease. If the mucus plugs or secretions occlude the bronchial trees and cannot be cleaned by coughing, suctioning, or vigorous respiratory and physical therapy, is rigid ventilation bronchoscopy (V-B) effective and safe as a therapeutic procedure in such patients? We collected 33 cases of pediatric pulmonary atelectasis that were treated by rigid V-B under general anesthesia for removal of the mucus plugs or foreign bodies. During the rigid V-B with lung lavage performed by experienced bronchoscopists, the oxygen saturation was maintained in good condition. No disastrous complications were noted. Sixty-four percent (21/33) of those with pediatric pulmonary atelectasis had significant improvement in either oxygen saturation or chest radiography within 72 hours. We conclude that when the traditional treatment in pediatric pulmonary atelectasis was ineffective, rigid V-B might be an adequate and safe procedure to remove the mucus plugs and restore pulmonary function.
