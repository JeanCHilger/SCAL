Community-acquired parapneumonic effusion in children: what's new?. Community-acquired pleural infection is a life-threatening complication of pneumonia in children. It seems to be more prevalent actually. This pathology is associated with an high morbidity and frequently requires prolonged hospitalization and invasives procedures. However, there is no consensus on its management in pediatrics, especially because of the lack of trials. To improve the quality of the future studies and to compare the series, a child-adapted classification is required. To date, in attempt of evidence, chest drainage or thoracocentesis-thoracoscopy are questionable. For treatment, high regimens of synergic and intravenously-delivered antibiotics seem to be the better choice.
