Color Doppler US pulmonary artery vessel signal: a sign for predicting the benign lesions. The lung cancer blood supply originates from the bronchial artery. If vessel signals within pulmonary lesions can be confirmed to be those of the pulmonary artery, color Doppler ultrasound (US) should be able to predict and differentiate benign lesions from lung cancers. Two hundred sixty-four patients with abutting thoracic lesions (including 125 lung cancers and 139 benign lesions) underwent color Doppler US examinations. A pulsatile flow, with the vessel signal length on sonographic appearance > or =1 cm demonstrated by color Doppler US, was arbitrarily defined as a pulmonary artery vessel signal. Of the 264 thoracic lesions, 73 (58%) lung cancers and 107 (77%) benign lesions had detectable color Doppler US pulsatile flow vessel signals. Analyzing the pulsatile flow vessel signals, the color Doppler US pulmonary artery vessel signal was present in 74 (53%) benign lesions, but was found in only two (2%) lung cancers of a specific alveolar cell carcinoma with lobar consolidation. Using the pulmonary artery vessel signal, color Doppler US can be valuable in predicting and differentiating benign lesions from lung cancers (p < 0.0001, sensitivity = 0.53, specificity = 0.98 and positive likelihood ratio 26.5). In conclusion, color Doppler US pulmonary artery vessel signal sign is useful in predicting and differentiating benign lesions from lung cancers.
