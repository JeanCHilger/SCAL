Clinical characterisation of pneumonia caused by atypical pathogens combining classic and novel predictors. The aim of this study was to characterise community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by atypical pathogens by combining distinctive clinical and epidemiological features and novel biological markers. A population-based prospective study of consecutive patients with CAP included investigation of biomarkers of bacterial infection, e.g., procalcitonin, C-reactive protein and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) levels. Clinical, radiological and laboratory data for patients with CAP caused by atypical pathogens were compared by univariate and multivariate analysis with data for patients with typical pathogens and patients from whom no organisms were identified. Two predictive scoring models were developed with the most discriminatory variables from multivariate analysis. Of 493 patients, 94 had CAP caused by atypical pathogens. According to multivariate analysis, patients with atypical pneumonia were more likely to have normal white blood cell counts, have repetitive air-conditioning exposure, be aged <65 years, have elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels, have been exposed to birds, and have lower serum levels of LBP. Two different scoring systems were developed that predicted atypical pathogens with sensitivities of 35.2% and 48.8%, and specificities of 93% and 91%, respectively. The combination of selected patient characteristics and laboratory data identified up to half of the cases of atypical pneumonia with high specificity, which should help clinicians to optimise initial empirical therapy for CAP.
