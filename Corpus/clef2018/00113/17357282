The effect of extracorporeal efferent detoxication (EED) methods inclusion in the severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) treatment. To assess the clinical efficacy including of EED methods in the treatment of severe CAP with endogenic intoxication syndrome.Severe CAP in patients (n = 103, aged 18-60 years, male 89%) were randomly subdivided into the 4 comparable groups. The 1st group (n = 30) was standard treated with antibiotics. The 2nd group (n = 27) underwent additionally 3 courses of extracorporeal ultraviolet light-exposure (UVLE). The 3rd group (n = 25) was co-treated with 3 courses of biospecific hemosorption (BSS). The 4th group (n = 21) underwent 2 additional courses of BSS plus 3 courses of UVLE. The effectiveness of these schemes therapy was assessed by clinical and laboratory data.The additional application of EED methods led to faster disappearance of clinical symptoms, focal chest signs and the infiltrate resolution in chest X-ray (CXR) as compared with standard treatment. Mean time of the disappearance of fever and sweating was 2.2 2.5Additional using of EED methods in severe CAP therapy is more effective (as compared with traditional management with antibiotics only) in term of faster improvement of patients general condition, reduced time of inflammatory infiltrate resolution and hospitalization by 3-4 days. It has been shown that EED methods correct the main pathogenic mechanisms of severe CAP. Our results indicated on the EED methods as an attractive supportive therapy for the empiric antibiotics treatment of this disease.
