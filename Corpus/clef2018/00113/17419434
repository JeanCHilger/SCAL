Testing for Mycoplasma pneumonia using the ImmunoCard Mycoplasma rapid test. We evaluated the effectiveness of ImmunoCard Mycoplasma rapid tests in all patients admitted with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) between January, 2004 and December, 2005. ImmunoCard Mycoplasma rapid tests were performed on the 1st day of admission and we analyzed the frequency of positive cases among CAP cases according to month and age. A total of 82 of 270 (33.7%) and 41 of 257 (16.0%) were positive among CAP cases in 2004 and 2005, respectively. More positive cases were seen between spring and early summer and in cases aged 70 years or more, especially those over 80 years old. These results indicated that further evaluation is required among positive cases in elder group.
