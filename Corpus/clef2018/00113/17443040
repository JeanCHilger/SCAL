Leukocytoclastic vasculitis after pneumococcal pneumonia in an elderly adult. Hypersensitivity vasculitis (HSV) has been used to describe several forms of vasculitis of small blood vessels, including Henoch-Sch√∂nlein purpura (HSP), mixed cryoglobulinemia, and allergic vasculitis, etc. HSP is a disease occasionally seen in childhood, and is characterized by dermatological and abdominal symptoms. Here, we report a rare case of HSV which showed a clinical course similar to HSP after pneumococcal pneumonia in an elderly adult. Generally, Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common pathogen in adult community-acquired pneumonia. Therefore, it is critical to recognize HSV as one of the important complications after bacterial infection, especially Streptococcus pneumoniae.
