Mycoplasma pneumonia: clinical and radiographic features in 39 children. The purpose of the present paper was to evaluate the clinical and chest radiographic features of pediatric patients with serologically proven Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (mycoplasma pneumonia).The clinical records and chest radiographs of 39 consecutive patients (19 male, 20 female age 3-13 years) with serologically positive IgG and IgM mycoplasma pneumonia were reviewed.More than 90% of patients presented with fever and cough and 48% of patients had leukocyte count >10,000/mm(3). A C-reactive protein (CRP) level >0.375 mg/dL was noted in 28 patients (72%). Chest radiographs displayed four different patterns: (i) peribronchial and perivascular interstitial infiltrates (n= 19, 49%) (ii) airspace consolidations (n= 15, 38%)There are various radiological features of mycoplasma pneumonia in children. Bilateral peribronchial and perivascular interstitial infiltrates were most frequently seen in the present patients.
