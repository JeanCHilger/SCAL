Predictive factors of etiologic agents of community-acquired pneumonia presenting at a district general hospital. Community-acquired pneumonia is one of the major respiratory diseases causing hospital admission in previously healthy patients. Prompt and appropriate antibiotic selection is essential for recovery. The authors tried to determine the distribution of the etiologic agents of community-acquired pneumonias and to analyze predictive factors. Out of 188 cases of community-acquired pneumonia presenting to our hospital, etiologic agents were determined in 106 cases (56%). Twenty-nine cases were due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, 27 cases due to Mycoplasma, 17 cases due to Haemophilus influenzae and 21 cases due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. M. tuberculosis was the cause in 11% of all cases and the importance of pulmonary tuberculosis must be emphasized as a community-acquired pneumonia. Out of 58 cases under 50 years old, Mycoplasma pneumoniae was the etiologic agent in 23 cases (40%) and S. pneumoniae in 7 cases (12%). Out of 62 cases not less than 70 years old. M. tuberculosis was the most common etiologic agent (15 cases, 24%). S. pneumoniae followed, being causative in 13 cases (21%). M. tuberculosis was the cause in 10 cases out of 31 cases who did not complain of fever at presentation. In 86 cases who did not show leukocytosis on admission, 21 cases were due to Mycoplasma (24%) and 15 cases were due to M. tuberculosis (17%). In particular 17 cases were due to Mycoplasma among 28 cases under 50 years old without leukocytosis (61%), and 11 cases were due to M. tuberculosis in the 27 cases no less than 70 years old without leukocytosis (41%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
