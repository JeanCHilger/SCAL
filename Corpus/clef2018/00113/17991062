Lemierre's syndrome revisited: case report and imaging findings. Lemierre's syndrome, characterized by infective thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein with septic emboli, was once a ubiquitous condition with high mortality rate in the pre-antibiotic era. Radiological literature on this condition has been scanty in the era of cross-sectional imaging. We present a 16-year-old patient with Lemierre's syndrome with discussion of the typical clinical features and CT findings.
