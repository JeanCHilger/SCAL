Importance of immunoregulation and erythropoiesis estimation in disorders with activated immune system. Complicated immunoregulatory events in different disorders depend on the pathologic process itself and the phase of disease. Immune parameters aberrations in advanced phase of disease, compared to initial ones, may be significant, making hard the understanding of basic immunoregulatory process of the disease. Intending to explain immune mechanisms in different disorders with activation of the immune system as basic pathogenic event (infections, autoimmune diseases), particularly in advanced phase of the disease, on a parallel with standard laboratory investigations of erythropoiesis (hemoglobin, red blood cell count, hematocrit) the following examinations of the immune system were done: white blood cell count, immunophenotyping of lymphocytes, ability of the phagocytes to reduce NBT, chemiluminescent response after stimulation with opsonized and nonopsonized particles. Analysis of erythropoietic parameters in order to see the consequences of the regulatory mechanisms of the immune system (cytokines, interleukins) on hemopoiesis may enable us to understand the mechanisms of disease with the initial activation of the immune system. Finding anemia might be useful in defining the immunoregulatory mechanisms involved in particular pathologic process important for therapeutic approach.
