Bronchiectasis in children with recurrent pneumonia: an immunopathological damage associated with secondary ciliary dysmotility. The aim of this study is to assess ciliary motion patterns in children with bronchiectasis unrelated to cystic fibrosis or primary ciliary dyskinesia. In 51 children with recurrent pneumonia, high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) was carried out to detect and score bronchiectasis. Moreover, ciliary ultrastructure, beat frequency and motion pattern were evaluated and compared to those observed in 30 healthy children. Bronchiectasis at HRCT was found in 31/51 children. Ciliary dysmotility was found in 20/31 children with bronchiectasis (64.5%). Overall, ciliary dysmotility was found in 39/51 patients (76.5%). Ciliary dysmotility showed a significant correlation with the HRCT score (p=0.02). Absent motion in some fields was found in 44/51 patients (86.3%) and this also showed significant correlation with the HRCT score (p=0.005). The specificity and sensitivity of ciliary dysmotility as an indicator of bronchiectasis was 74.3% and 83.3% respectively. The positive predictive value was 93.5%, and negative predictive value was 50%. Ciliary dysmotility, in children with recurrent airways infections, correlates with the presence and severity of bronchiectasis. Whether ciliary dysmotility is a cause or a consequence of anatomical lesion is a matter of speculation. Very likely there is an amplification and self-maintaining mechanism between the two events which may lead to more serious disease.
