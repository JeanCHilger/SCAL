Effects of prior effective therapy on the efficacy of daptomycin and ceftriaxone for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. We sought to compare daptomycin with ceftriaxone for the treatment of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).Two phase-3 randomized, double-blind trials that enrolled adult patients hospitalized with CAP were conducted. Patients received intravenous daptomycin (4 mg/kg) or ceftriaxone (2 g) once daily for 5-14 days. Aztreonam could be added for patients with gram-negative infections. Clinical responses at the test-of-cure visit among patients in the intent-to-treat and clinically evaluable populations were the primary efficacy end points.After combining data from the trials, the intent-to-treat population included 413 daptomycin-treated patients and 421 ceftriaxone-treated patients, and the clinically evaluable population included 369 daptomycin-treated patients and 371 ceftriaxone-treated patients. In the intent-to-treat population, the clinical cure rate among daptomycin-treated patients with CAP was 70.9%, compared with 77.4% among ceftriaxone-treated patients (95% confidence interval for the difference between cure rates, -12.4% to -0.6%). In the clinically evaluable population, the clinical cure rate was lower among daptomycin-treated patients (79.4%) than among ceftriaxone-treated patients (87.9% 95% confidence interval for the difference between cure rates, -13.8% to -3.2%). A posthoc analysis revealed that, among those who had received up to 24 h of prior effective therapy, cure rates were similar among daptomycin-treated (90.7%) and ceftriaxone-treated patients (88.0%Daptomycin is not effective for the treatment of CAP, including infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. The observation that as little as 24 h of prior effective therapy may impact clinical outcome suggests that trials to evaluate CAP treatment may need to exclude patients who have received any potentially effective therapy before enrollment.
