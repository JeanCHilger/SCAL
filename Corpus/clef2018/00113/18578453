A right-sided congenital diaphragmatic hernia masked by pneumonia. A 1-day-old premature newborn (34 weeks and 6 days) presented with respiratory insufficiency due to a group B haemolytic streptococcal (GBS) pneumonia. She recovered after temporary treatment with mechanical ventilation and antibiotics. At the time of discharge there was a slight increased fogging on the right side of the chest X-ray, interpreted as residual pleural effusion. Three days later the patient was readmitted with respiratory failure and a need for respiratory support. A chest CT scan revealed a right-sided congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) with a large part of the liver and intestine in the chest. The diaphragmatic defect was closed during a surgical procedure. After an uneventful recovery the patient was discharged in good clinical condition. The combination of delayed presentation of right-sided CDH and neonatal GBS infection occurs rarely but has been described. Its pathogenesis is still unclear.
