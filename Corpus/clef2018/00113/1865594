Clinical features of 32 cases of fungal pneumonia. A total of 32 patients with mycoses other than cavity-formed aspergilloma were reviewed. The main pathogenic fungi were Aspergillus in 14, Candida in 8, Cryptococcus in 4, Trichosporon in 4 and Mucor in 2. Coinfection by two species was detected in 3 cases: Trichosporon and Aspergillus in 2 and Aspergillus and Candida in 1. The underlying diseases were hematologic malignancies in all cases except 1 case of lung cancer. The hematologic malignancies were mostly leukemias of various types. Cryptococcosis developed in patients given long-term corticosteroid treatment but not in leukemic patients. All cases of aspergillosis, candidiasis and mucormycosis were due to nosocomial infection. On the other hand, 3 of 4 cases of cryptococcosis or trichosporonosis were attributable to community-acquired infection. Two of 4 trichosporonosis cases were considered to have been acquired during 2-day home stays. The diagnosis of pulmonary mycosis was made pathologically in 18 and clinically in 14 cases. Of the latter, 6 cases had an air-crescent sign on chest X-ray films and 8 cases were culture-positive. Extrapulmonary involvement was seen in all 16 cases of candidiasis, cryptococcosis and trichosporonosis but not in 10 of 14 aspergillosis cases. Severe granulocytopenia was present in all cases except 4 cases of cryptococcosis and 3 cases of aspergillosis. Chest X-ray findings of aspergillosis were of two types: one was an air-crescent sign which was noted in the recovery phase from leukopenia and the other was gradually enlarging consolidation which was bound by the interlobar fissure and progressed to lobar penumonia. A diffuse granular shadow was not characteristic of any fungus species.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
