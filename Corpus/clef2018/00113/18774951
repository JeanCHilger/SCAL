Incidence, risks, and outcome of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome early after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. We retrospectively analyzed 23 cases with early-onset idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) of 192 patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from April 1997 to October 2007. Risk factors for IPS development were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards model, including age, gender, underlying disease, disease status at transplant, transplant type, conditioning regimens, donor type, acute graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD), severity of acute GVHD (aGVHD), human leukocyte antigen (HLA) disparity, and organ involvement of aGVHD. Factors that were significant at the 0.1 level on univariate analysis were evaluated by multivariate analysis. Twenty-three of 192 patients developed IPS (12.0%). Median time to IPS onset after allogeneic HSCT was 76 d (range 32-120 d) median time to death after the diagnosis of IPS was 9 d (range 3-92 d)
