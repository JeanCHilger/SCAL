Pulmonary manifestations of HIV infection in children. We retrospectively reviewed the spectrum, course, and outcome of pulmonary diseases in 66 children with AIDS, hospitalized between 1982 and 1988, prior to the use of zidovudine. Fifty-two of the 66 (79%) patients developed pulmonary problems. In fifty-two percent of all patients, a pulmonary problem was the first symptom of HIV infection. The most common respiratory illness requiring hospitalization was an episode of respiratory distress with normal PaO2 and unchanged X-ray with a 9.7 +/- 6.8 days mean duration of hospitalization. Bacterial pneumonia, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and pulmonary lymphoid hyperplasia/lymphoid interstitial pneumonia occurred in 30%, 32% and 22% of the patients, respectively. Bacterial pneumonia and PCP were associated with a high mortality rate. Sixty-eight percent of the patients died within 24 months of the onset of pulmonary disease. In 50% of the children, pulmonary disease was a primary cause of death. The results of this study can be useful in developing prospective studies for the prevention and treatment of pulmonary complications of HIV infection.
