Primary immunodeficiency diseases in Egyptian children: a single-center study. Sixty-four primary immunodeficiency patients were registered at the Pediatric Allergy and Immunology Department, Children's Hospital, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.Predominantly antibody deficiencies were the most common category (35.9%) followed by combined T- and B-cell immunodeficiencies (29.7%), other well defined immunodeficiency syndromes (18.7%), congenital defects of phagocyte number, function or both (12.5%), and diseases of immune dysregulation (3.1%). The most frequent disorder was common variable immunodeficiency (18.7%). The mean age at diagnosis was 29.9 months. The consanguinity rate was 62.5%. Recurrent severe infections were seen in all categories. Fifteen patients died (23.4%) from infections with the highest mortality for combined T- and B-cell immunodeficiencies (15.6%).Primary immunodeficiency disorders are not rare in Egyptian children. The observed frequency of combined T- and B-cell immunodeficiencies in our cohort is relatively higher than other countries. It is a prerequisite to establish a national registry of primary immunodeficiency in Egypt.
