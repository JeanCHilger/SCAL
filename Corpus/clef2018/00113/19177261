Community acquired Staphylococcus aureus meningitis in adults. We present 9 patients with community acquired Staphylococcus aureus meningitis. Foci of infection outside the central nervous system were present in 8 (89%) patients, mostly endocarditis and pneumonia. Cardiorespiratory complications occurred frequently and 6 patients died (67%). Identification and treatment of the primary focus of infection should be a priority in these patients.
