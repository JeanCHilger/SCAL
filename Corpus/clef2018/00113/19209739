Respiratory syncytial virus: as an etiological agent of respiratory tract infection in children and adults. Respiratory Syncytial Virus is the most important cause of respiratory tract infection in infants, young children and immunocompromised adults. RSV disease spectrum includes a wide array of respiratory symptoms, from rhinitis and otits media to pneumonia and bronchiolitis. Studies have implicated severe RSV infection early in life as a risk factor for subsequent development of reactive airway disease. RSV-infected patients indicated increased levels of Th2 cytokines and IgE in the patients sera, suggesting that an allergy-like condition may develop during infection. However, the mechanism by which RSV contributes to asthma is complex and remains largely unknown. Despite its importance as a pathogen, there is no licensed vaccine against RSV. Lack of effective immunoprofilaxis as well as high risk of development of serious sequels make the diagnostics indispensable in controlling spread of the virus.
