Chlamydiae as pathogens--an overview of diagnostic techniques, clinical features, and therapy of human infections. Chlamydiae are Gram-negative bacteria with obligate intracellular reproduction and disability to synthesize high-energy compounds such as ATP. Their cycle of development is unique among the prokaryotes: the host cells, mainly epithelial cells, are infected by so-called elementary bodies (EB) which undergo reorganization to form metabolically active reticulate bodies (RB). These RB multiply by binary fission, and after transition into infectious EB they are released within 48-72 hours. Chlamydiae cause prolonged subclinical infections of the conjunctiva, lung, cervix, and urethra. Complications in newborns are inclusion conjunctivitis, nasopharyngitis and pneumonia in females, salpingitis, infertility, and perihepatitis
