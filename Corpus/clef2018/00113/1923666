Clinical observations on lower respiratory tract infections with special reference to serum IgE levels. To examine if the occurrence of wheezing among children with lower respiratory tract infections is associated with atopic predisposition, serum levels of IgE were determined for groups of children with or without wheezing, during infection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). In M. pneumoniae infection, more than 60% of wheezy children over 2 years of age showed a high IgE level (200 IU/mL or more), while IgE levels were less than 200 IU/mL in 73% of non-wheezy children. In RSV infection, the incidence of high IgE levels among wheezy children was nearly double that of non-wheezy children, although the difference was not significant. These results suggest that in children an allergic disposition is involved in the occurrence of wheezing during the course of lower respiratory tract infections.
