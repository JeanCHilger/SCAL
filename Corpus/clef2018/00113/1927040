Laboratory diagnosis of pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The authors demonstrated the possibility to use the technique of counter current immunoelectrophoresis, enzyme immunoassay and passive hemagglutination tests with antibody erythrocytic diagnosticum for the rapid laboratory diagnosis of Mycoplasma infection. The rapid diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumonias turned to be possible due to the detection of antigen and antibodies to M. pneumoniae in the circulation with the help of counter current immunoelectrophoresis.
