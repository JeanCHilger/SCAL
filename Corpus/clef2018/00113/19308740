Management in the emergency room of patients requiring hospital treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. To identify factors influencing decisions in initial management of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) admitted to hospital through Emergency departments.Records of CAP adult patients admitted to 24 Spanish hospitals in January-March 2003 were reviewed. Patients sent for ambulatory treatment were excluded.341 patients (67.0 +/- 24.6 years 65.3% males) were includedRapid diagnostic tests were underused, maybe due to broad empirical treatments covering drug-resistant pneumococci and L. pneumophila (regardless PSI and comorbidity). Presence of comorbidities or positive results in rapid diagnostic tests seems to influence the medical ward to which the patient is referred to, but not initial treatment.
