Comparison of laboratory diagnostic procedures for detection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in community outbreaks. Mycoplasma pneumoniae continues to be a significant cause of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). A more definitive methodology for reliable detection of M. pneumoniae is needed to identify outbreaks and to prevent potentially fatal extrapulmonary complications.We analyzed 2 outbreaks of CAP due to M. pneumoniae. Nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swab specimens and serum samples were obtained from persons with clinically defined cases, household contacts, and asymptomatic individuals. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for M. pneumoniae was performed on all swab specimens, and the diagnostic utility was compared with that of 2 commercially available serologic test kits.For cases, 21% yielded positive results with real-time PCR, whereas 81% and 54% yielded positive results with the immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G/immunoglobulin M serologic tests, respectively. For noncases, 1.8% yielded positive results with real-time PCR, whereas 63% and 79% yielded serologically positive results with the immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G/immunoglobulin M kits, respectively. The sensitivity of real-time PCR decreased as the duration between symptom onset and sample collection increased, with a peak sensitivity of 48% at 0-21 days. A specificity of 43% for the immunoglobulin M antibody detection assay was observed for persons aged 10-18 years, but the sensitivity increased to 82% for persons aged 19 years.Thorough data analysis indicated that no single available test was reliable for the identification of an outbreak of CAP due to M. pneumoniae. A combination of testing methodologies proved to be the most reliable approach for identification of outbreaks of CAP due to M. pneumoniae, especially in the absence of other suspected respiratory pathogens.
