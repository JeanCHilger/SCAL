Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae coinfection in severe pneumoniae among a hospitalized child with respiratory distress: what are the best diagnostic tools for an optimal care?. The role for Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae in lower and upper respiratory tract infections in childhood increased by use of specialised diagnostic techniques, more and more performant for the early diagnosis of these infections. However, the prevalence of M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae as a cause of severe pneumoniae among hospitalized children has been rarely described. We report a case of M. pneumoniae et C. pneumoniae coinfection in a 10-year-old child hospitalized with a respiratory distress.
