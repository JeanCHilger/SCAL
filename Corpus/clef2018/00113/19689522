Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy for hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis associated with systemic lupus erythematosus in a child. Hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis is a type of urticarial vasculitis with multisystemic involvement and poor prognosis, sometimes associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. Several therapies have been attempted with no consensus on an effective therapeutic regimen. Intravenous immunoglobulin has been used in severe manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus and recently in hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis. We present a 7-year-old girl with hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis associated with systemic lupus erythematosus and pneumonia who responded favorably to intravenous immunoglobulin.
