Prolonged after-effects of pneumonia in children. Sixty-two black children were prospectively followed up for 1-7 years after pneumonia contracted at a median age of 17 months. In 55% of cases the pneumonia was measles-associated and 27% had serological evidence of infection with other respiratory viruses. Recurrence of cough or wheeze for more than 6 months occurred in 85% with just over 50% having recovered during the follow-up period. While the highest incidence of persistent symptoms occurred in children after measles superinfected with another virus, this was not significant. Abnormal radiographic features persisted in 53% of children and consisted of peribronchial and/or parenchymal lesions. Abnormal large and small airway calibre and/or bronchial hyperreactivity were found in one-third of children, and were significantly more common in those children whose main symptom was recurrent wheezing. Clinical and lung function abnormalities years after lower respiratory tract infection in this group of disadvantaged children compare with reports from more privileged groups. Recognition that long-term sequelae occur may prevent inappropriate subsequent management of symptomatic children.
