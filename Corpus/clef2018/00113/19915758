Mucocutaneous findings of the Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection: presentation of four cases. The mucocutaneous manifestations of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection appear in approximately 20% of all the infections produced by this microorganism. Maculopapular rash, vesicular or urticarial exanthemas, are frequent manifestations that can constitute Erythema multiforme or more rarely, Stevens-Johnson syndrome or epidermal toxic necrolisis. We describe the clinical evolution, diagnosis and treatment of four children with mucous and cutaneous manifestations associated to infection by Mycoplasma pneumoniae and a review of the medical literature.
