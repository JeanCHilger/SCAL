Treatment of encapsulated pleural effusions in children: a prospective trial. The aim of this study was to improve the efficacy of treatment of complicated pleural effusions.In this prospective study, 76 consecutive children (average age 5.0 +/- 4.14 years) fulfilling the required classification criteria were duly treated with chest tube placement and divided into two groups depending on the presence of encapsulated or non-encapsulated effusions. Treatment of the former group was supplemented by intrapleural fibrinolysis. The effectiveness of treatment was assessed in terms of chest tube dwell-time and total length of hospitalization. Regression analysis was performed using independent factors that were associated with these dependent factors. Value differences for P < 0.05 were considered significant.The ultrasound pleural distance and lactic-dehydrogenase content in the pleural fluid was significantly associated with the length of treatment (P < 0.01). Improved response to treatment, reduced duration of hospitalization (9.2 +/- 1.9 vs 11.5 +/- 0.9 P < 0.01) and tube dwell-time (7.6 +/- 1.3 vs 9.5 +/- 0.9The authors recommend intrapleural fibrinolysis as an effective and safe alternative treatment strategy in treating encapsulated pleural effusions in children.
