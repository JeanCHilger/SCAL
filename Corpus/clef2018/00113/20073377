A 12-year-old girl with Hodgkin's disease presenting as a non-resolving pneumonia and an endobronchial nodule. The presence of a non-resolving pneumonia warrants the suspicion of a possible malignancy. While pulmonary involvement in Hodgkin's disease can present as a non-resolving pneumonia, the clinical clues of dyspnoea, stridor and wheeze point to a possible endobronchial involvement. A bronchoscopy in such a situation can be valuable for diagnosis, and can aid in staging of the disease. The true incidence of endobronchial involvement in Hodgkin's disease is not known, but when diagnosed early and treated appropriately, the prognosis is usually good, and a complete cure is possible.
