Genetic analysis of a strain of adenovirus Ad7d2 isolated from an infant died of pneumonia. To analyze the genetic characteristics of a strain of adenovirus, Ad7d2, isolated from an infant died of severe pneumonia.Virus isolation was performed by using the nasopharyngeal secretion from an 11-month-old infant with serious pneumonia. The viral DNA was amplified by PCR and the products were sequenced.One strain of virus was isolated and was named as BJ060316-1. Sequence analysis of the hexon and fiber gene of the PCR products showed that the strain was Ad7d2, which shared 99.5% homology for 950bp hexon fragment with AF321311 Ad7d2 isolated from Israel in 1993. Blast with deduced amino acid sequence showed that BJ060316-1 lost glutamine at site 253, and at the site 495 arginine replaced serine. For fiber gene, BJ060316-1 showed 99.7% homology with AB243118 Ad7 isolated in Japan in 2005 for 975 bp fragment.Adenovirus Ad7d2 strain BJ060316-1 isolated from a an infant with fatal pneumonia showed no virulence mutation.
