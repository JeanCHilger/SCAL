Does sputum culture affect the management and/or outcome of community-acquired pneumonia? This prospective study was conducted in 6 hospitals in Edmonton, Canada to determine the factors associated with obtaining sputum for culture and the effect of sputum culture on the management of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Participants were 1362 adults who were hospitalized with CAP. Sputum was obtained from 539 (39.6%) patients, of which 507 (94.1%) were good quality, acceptable for culture 171 (33.7%) of these had a positive sputum culture. Levofloxacin, cefuroxime and azithromycin were the most common antibiotics prescribed for the groups with positive sputum culture and no sputum collection. Positive sputum culture was demonstrated in only a small number of patients with CAP
