Traditional Chinese and Western medicine treatment of mycoplasmal pneumonia in children and the serum cytokine changes. To observe the therapeutic effect of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicine (WM) treatments on mycoplasmal pneumonia in children and the changes in the serum cytokines.Ninety children with mycoplasmal pneumonia were randomly divided into the treatment group and the control group. TCM was given orally and azithromycin at the daily dose of 10 mg/kg was administered intravenously in the treatment group. In the control group, only intravenous azithromycin was given. After a 7-day treatment, the response rate, time of symptom disappearance, and serum levels of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha were observed.The total response rate was 93.33% in the treatment group and 73.33% in the control group, showing a significantly better therapeutic effect in the treatment group (P<0.05). The combined treatments also showed better effects in alleviating fever, coughing and rales (P<0.05), and resulted in more obvious reduction in the serum levels of cytokines (P<0.05).Combined treatment with TCM and WM produce good therapeutic effects in children with mycoplasmal pneumonia.
