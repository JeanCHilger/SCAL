Predictive factors of morbidity in childhood parapneumonic effusion-associated pneumonia: a retrospective study. To find the clinical and laboratory criteria that best predict a prolonged fever in children with parapneumonic effusion-associated pneumonia treated conservatively.Retrospective, cohort study.Children admitted to the Shaare Zedek Medical Center between January 1, 1997, and December 31, 2006, and who had been discharged with a diagnosis of empyema and pleurisy.One hundred-twenty children were included, all of whom were treated with antibiotics in 80 patients, a thoracic drain was introducedIn children with parapneumonic effusion-associated pneumonia, a positive bacterial culture and an underlying disease are associated with prolonged fever. A low score based on platelet count, pH pleural fluid and glucose, and LDH pleural/serum ratio is associated with a prolonged fever. We speculate that children with the risk factors mentioned earlier may be the best candidates for an early aggressive approach.
