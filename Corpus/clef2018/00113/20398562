To analyze the characteristics of a new clinical syndrome, including throat infection, neck spinal disease, chest pain and cardiac response.A total of 165 patients with above mentioned symptoms admitted to Tongji hospital from 2003 to 2005 were included in this study and underwent further medical history inquiry, physical examination and laboratory tests. Eighty-five healthy subjects served as controls. Serum myocardial auto-antibodies against beta(1)-adrenoceptor, alpha-myosin heavy chain, M(2)-muscarinic receptor and adenine-nucleotide translocator were detected, inflammatory cytokines, high sensitivity C-reaction protein, serum antibodies against Coxsackie virus-B, cytomegalovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae were determined and lymphocyte subclasses were assayed by flow cytometry.All patients had a complex of four symptoms or tetralogy: (1) persistent throat or upper respiratory tract infection (2) neck painThese data led to identification of a persistent respiratory infection-related clinical syndrome, including persistent throat infection, neck spinal lesion, rib cartilage inflammation, symptoms of cardiac depression and dyspnea with or without anxiety.
