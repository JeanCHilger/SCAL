Correlation of levels of alpha-defensins determined by HPLC-ESI-MS in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid with the diagnosis of pneumonia in premature neonates. The presence of alpha-defensins in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was investigated in a cohort of preterm newborns with gestational age (GA) < or =30 wk. Specimens were collected during the first week of life from 24 preterm neonates mechanically ventilated. The studied population was divided into two groups: pneumonia group of nine neonates suffering from pulmonary infection (GA: 26.1 +/- 2.1 wk birth weight: 787.4 +/- 309.9 g), with or without associated bloodstream infection, and nonpneumonia group of 15 neonates (GA: 27.7 +/- 2.0 wk
