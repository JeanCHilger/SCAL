Changes in plasma hemostatic parameters under intravascular laser irradiation of blood in patients with community-acquired pneumonia. To study the time course of changes in the activity of the protein C system and other hemostatic parameters under intravascular laser irradiation of blood (ILIB) in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).One hundred and forty patients aged 17 to 62 years (mean 39.5 +/- 8.4 years) with CAP were examined. A control group (n = 40) received conventional drug therapy the study group (n = 100) had a course of ILIB in addition to conventional therapy.Before treatment, the patients with CAP were observed to have a lower protein C system activity and the signs of hypercoagulation that were eliminated by ILIB.ILIB is an effective method in correcting hemocoagulative disorders in patients with CAP.
