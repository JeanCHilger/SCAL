The parameters of the blood prooxidant and antioxidant systems in bacterial and viral pneumonias. To determine the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) in plasma and nitro blue tetrasolium in leukocytes as parameters of the blood prooxidant system and the activity of ceruloplasmin (CP) in serum and erythrocyte catalase as the parameters of antioxidant activity in bacterial and viral pneumonias.The blood prooxidant and antioxidant systems were studied in 177 patients with bacterial and viral pneumonia over time.Heterodirectional changes were found in the parameters of the blood prooxidant and antioxidant systems in bacterial and viral pneumonias. There was a regular and significant increase in MDA levels, spontaneous HCT test, and erythrocyte catalase. At the same tine, CP activity depending on the etiology, stage, and degree of the disease was inhibited.Severe prolonged impairments in the activity of the prooxidant and antioxidant systems and changes in their parameters are indicative of the more severe course of the disease, the presence of complications and infectious-inflammatory concomitant diseases.
