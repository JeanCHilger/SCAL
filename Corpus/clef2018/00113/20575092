Community-acquired Moraxella catarrhalis pneumonia in previously healthy children. The aim of this study was to determine if Moraxella catarrhalis is a common cause of community acquired pneumonia in children with no chronic medical problems. A secondary goal was to describe the clinical features of children with M. catarrhalis pneumonia.A systematic literature search was conducted for (i) case series of pediatric community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) where one or more diagnostic tests for M. catarrhalis were applied to all cases and (ii) case reports of previously healthy children with proven M. catarrhalis pneumonia.There were nine case series describing a total of 1,500 children with CAP. The number of children tested and yield was as follows: blood cultures 0/402 (0%) sputum cultures 15/157 (10%)It is common to detect M. catarrhalis in upper respiratory secretions in children with pneumonia, but bacteremia or seroconversion is rare. There are only eight well-documented case reports CAP due to M. catarrhalis in previously well children, with there being no distinctive features in the eight cases described to date. This organism is likely a rare cause of CAP in previously healthy children.
