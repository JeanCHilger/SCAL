Community-acquired pneumonia in a child. Children's pneumonias should be treated with antibiotics. Since the symptoms and findings vary, a chest radiograph is required for a definite diagnosis. The most important causative agent of pneumonia, the pneumococcus, must always be covered when considering antibiotic therapy. Penicillin or amoxicillin are the first-line antibiotics in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in children. Treatment of infants is readily initiated intravenously with benzyl penicillin, but hospital treatment can usually be restricted to 12 to 48 hours. If recovery does not start within 48 hours after initiation of antibiotic medication, the patient must be re-examined.
