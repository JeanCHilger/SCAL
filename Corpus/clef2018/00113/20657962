Diagnostic assessment of head nodding in hypoxemia in children with pneumonia. To assess the clinical usefulness of the head nodding sign (HN) in children with pneumonia.Cross-sectional study that included 62 children aged 2-59 months. Hypoxemia was defined as arterial oxygen saturation <94% measured by pulse oximetry. HN was examined with regard to three levels of hypoxemia (<94%, <or= 90%, <or= 84%).The overall prevalence of hypoxemia was 56.5 %. HN was observed in 64.5% (40) of the patients, 48.4% (30) of those had pneumonia and 73.1% were hypoxemic. HN showed a sensitivity of 73.2% and a specificity of 52.4%. Accuracy of HN was better when a cut off level <94% was used. HN in infants was a better index for hypoxemia than for older children.HN was a good predictor of hypoxemia in children with pneumonia. It seems that HN is an easily recognizable sign, and it could be easily taught to parents and health workers.
