Clinical and diagnostic value of the determination of alveomucin in patients with community-acquired pneumonia. The study was undertaken to define the clinical and diagnostic value of the determination of the serum levels of alveomucin in patients with community-acquired pneumonia and the correlation of this index with the etiological factors of the disease and its severity. The investigators used general clinical, laboratory, and instrumental studies and specific serodiagnostic assays of the pathogen and measured alveomucin levels on the principle of a double-site enzyme immunoassay. Examining the serum level of alveomucin in the examinees indicated that on admission day this index was 34% higher in the patients with community-acquired pneumonia than in the healthy individuals (52.59 +/- 2.8 and 39.22 +/- 2.8 U/ml, respectively). The mean value of this index was reduced to 49.88 +/- 2.29 U/ml) in the course of the disease. A certain association was found between the study index and the clinical characteristics of the disease: a direct correlation was established between the extent of lung injury and the level of mucin antigen. An assay of serum alveomucin depending on the severity of community-associated pneumonia revealed that on the first days of admission its values did not differ significantly from that in patients with different forms of the disease. However, there were statistically significant differences in this index according to the severity of the disease in its course. Analysis of serum alveomucin values in relation to the etiology of the disease also revealed certain regularities.
