Clinical features of endogenous bronchial foreign bodies and application of bronchoscopy in children. To study the clinical features of endogenous bronchial foreign bodies and the value of bronchoscopy in children.One hundred and six children who presented lobe or lung segment atelectasis by the chest X-ray and bronchial foreign body inhalation was excluded by bronchoscopy were enrolled. The original diseases included Mycoplasma pneumonia (n=62), endobronchial tuberculosis (n=24), bronchial pneumonia (n=16), nephrotic syndrome (n=2), laryngotracheal bronchitis (n=1) and bronchiolitis (n=1). On the basis of conventional treatment of the original diseases, bronchoscopy was performed in the children. Eighty children with bronchial foreign body inhalation severed as the control group.Bronchoscopy showed the properties of endogenous foreign bodies: mucus emboli in 77 cases, cheese substances in 24 cases, dendritic white membrane in 4 cases, thrombosis in 1 case, and flaky pseudomembrane in 1 case. Hyperplasia of granulation tissue was seen in 25 cases. Of the 25 cases, endobronchial tuberculosis as the original disease was found in 22 cases. Mediastinal emphysema and pneumothorax occurred in 4 cases in the control group, but none in the endogenous foreign bodies group. The number of bronchoalveolar lavage by bronchoscopy in the endogenous foreign bodies group was significantly higher than that in the control group.Bronchoscopy is valuable in the diagnosis and treatment of endogenous bronchial foreign bodies.
