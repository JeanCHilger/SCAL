Community‐acquired bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia in children: diagnosis and serotyping by real‐time polymerase chain reaction using blood samples. The aim of this study was to use real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on blood samples to diagnose and serotype pneumococcal infection in a large cohort of Italian children hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia.We conducted an observational study from April 2007 through June 2009 of children aged 0-16 years with a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia admitted to 83 pediatric hospitals in Italy.Seven hundred fifty-three children were studied. RT-PCR found pneumococcal infection in 80 (10.6%) of 753 patients. In 292 patients, culture and RT-PCR were simultaneously performed. Streptococcus pneumoniae was identified in 47 of 292 patients 45 (15.4%) tested positive by RT-PCR and 11 (3.8%) tested positive by culture. RT-PCR was significantly more sensitive than culture in revealing bacteremic pneumonia (odds ratio, 30.6RT-PCR allows diagnosis and serotyping of pneumococcal bacteremic community-acquired pneumonia in children and is an important tool for evaluating serotype distribution in culture-negative samples.
