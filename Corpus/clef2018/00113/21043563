The detection and clinical features of human cytomegalovirus infection in infants. The aim is to investigate the spectrum of disease in 378 infants with human cytomegalovirus infection. In these patients, 27.78% were systemic infection and 72.22% involved single organ infection. Hepatitis, thrombocytopenic purpura, pneumonia were predominant with 33.07%, 13.49%, 6.35% respectively. The rate of HCMV systemic infection in infants younger than 2 weeks was higher than in those older than 2 weeks. The gB genotype analysis in 107 cases showed 53 gBI, 20 gBII, 18 gBIII, 7 gBI+gBII, 5 gBI+gBIII and 4 gBII+gBIII. These results suggest that HCMV can infect multiorgan and has varietal clinic feature. The gBI genotype is most prevalent.
