Pulmonary functions in children with segmental Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia. To investigate the changes of pulmonary functions in children with segmental Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (SMPP).A total of 55 children with SMPP were recruited into this study. Pulmonary functions were measured at both acute and recovery phases, including FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC, PEF, FEF25%, FEF50%, FEF75% and FEF25%-75%.FVC, FEV1, FEV1 /FVC, PEF, FEF25%, FEF50%, FEF75%, and FEF25%-75% were reduced in all of the 55 cases at the acute phase. FEF25%, FEF50%, FEF75% and FEF25%-75% decreased more significantly. The indexes above mentioned were improved significantly at the recovery phase compared with the acute phase (P<0.05). During the acute phase FVC and FEV1 decreased more significantly in the group with multiple area lesions than in the group with single area lesions (P<0.05).Both large and small airway functions are damaged in different degrees in children with SMPP during the acute phase. More cases show restrictive ventilatory disorders and the injury of small airway function is more severe. The pulmonary function is markedly improved at the recovery phase, suggesting that the pulmonary function impairments are reversible. The pulmonary function impairments are more severe in children with multiple area lesions.
