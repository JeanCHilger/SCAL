Value of fluorescence quantitative PCR assay of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples in the diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia in children. To study the value of fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (FQ-PCR) for detecting Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP)-DNA in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in the early diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP).FQ-PCR was used to detect MP-DNA in BALF obtained by fiberoptic bronchoscopy from 61 children with MPP, and the sensitivity and the specificity of FQ-PCR were compared with the traditional serological test.The sensitivity and the specificity of BALF FQ-PCR for detecting MP-DNA were 94% and 100% respectively. The accuracy of BALF FQ-PCR assay for detecting MP-DNA was higher than that of the serological test at the early stage of the disease (1-7 days) (P<0.01). In the children with refractory MPP, BALF FQ-PCR assay also showed higher accuracy for detecting MP-DNA than the serological test (P<0.01). The copies of MP-DNA in children with refractory MPP were significant higher than those in children with common MPP (P<0.05). The copies of MP-DNA were positively correlated with CRP values (r=0.845, P<0.01).FQ-PCR assay of BALF for detecting MP-DNA in BALF is superior to the serological test. It is a reliable method for the early diagnosis of MPP, especially refractory MPP. The copies of MP-DNA can be used as an index for evaluation of the treatment outcome of refractory MPP.
