Opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome associated with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in an elderly patient. Opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syndrome (OMS) is a rare movement disorder characterized by chaotic saccadic, high amplitude, multidirectional and involuntary eye movements usually associated with myoclonus affecting the head, trunk, limbs and signs of cerebellar ataxia, especially the inability to stand and walk. We report a case of a 68 years-old woman, with previous history of diabetes mellitus and systemic hypertension that was referred for evaluation due to headache and low fever for three days. One day after the admission, she developed spatial and temporal disorientation and high-fever (39 Â°C). On her fourth day in-hospital, while still disoriented, diffuse limb myoclonia and intermittent, multidirectional and chaotic eye movements were noticed. Sorological tests and sputum Mycoplasma real-time PCR were positive on seventh day in-hospital. Patient was treated with Azithromycin and IV Immunoglobulin for five days. On third day after treatment it was noticed significant improvement of ataxia and myoclonia. Completely recovery after macrolydes and IVIg treatment, absence of a malignant neoplasia and knowledge of this entity in pediatric population support that parainfectious OMS associated with M. pneumoniae infections should be considered in the differential diagnosis of OMS in adults.
