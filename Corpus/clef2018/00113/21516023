Microbiology and mortality of pediatric febrile neutropenia in El Salvador. Febrile neutropenia (FN) and infection-related mortality are major problems for children with cancer in low-income countries. Identifying predictors for adverse outcome of FN in low-income countries permits targeted interventions. We describe the nature and predictors of microbiologically documented infection (MDI) and mortality of FN in children with cancer in El Salvador.We examined Salvadoran pediatric oncology patients admitted with FN over a 1-year period. Data were collected prospectively. Demographic, treatment, and admission-related variables were examined as predictors of outcomes.Hundred six FN episodes among 85 patients were included. Twenty-three of 106 episodes (22%) were microbiologically documented 13 of 106 episodes (12%) resulted in death. Gram-positive and gram-negative organisms were isolated in 14 of 23 and 11 of 23 specimensIn El Salvador, polymicrobial infections were common. Pneumonia at admission identified children with FN at high risk of death these children may benefit from targeted interventions.
