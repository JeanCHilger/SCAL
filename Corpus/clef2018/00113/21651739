Sole infection by human metapneumovirus among children with radiographically diagnosed community-acquired pneumonia in a tropical region. Limited information is available on the role of human metapneumovirus (HMPV) as the unique pathogen among children hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in a tropical region.We aimed to describe HMPV infection among children with CAP investigating bacterial and viral co-infections.A prospective study was carried out in Salvador, North-East Brazil. Overall, 268 children aged <5 years hospitalized for CAP were enrolled. Human metapneumovirus RNA was detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Sixteen other bacterial and viral pathogens were investigated by an expanded panel of laboratory methods. Chest X-ray taken on admission was read by an independent paediatric radiologist unaware of clinical information or the established aetiology.Human metapneumovirus RNA was detected in NPAs of 11 (4.1%) children, of which 4 (36%) had sole HMPV infection. The disease was significantly shorter among patients with sole HMPV infection in comparison with patients with mixed infection (4 ± 1 versus 7 ± 2 days, P = 0.03). Three of those four patients had alveolar infiltrates.Sole HMPV infection was detected in children with CAP in Salvador, North-East Brazil. HMPV may play a role in the childhood CAP burden.
