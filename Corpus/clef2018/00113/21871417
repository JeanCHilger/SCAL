Targeted preventive care may be needed for adults with congenital spine anomalies. To compare hospitalizations caused by spina bifida-sensitive conditions, ambulatory care-sensitive conditions in adults with spina bifida and in the general population, our aim was to provide information about whether preventive health efforts already underway in the hospitalized general population are adequate for preventive care in spina bifida and congenital spine anomalies.Retrospective secondary data analysis.Records of hospitalized individuals who were 18 years of age and older.Comparison between individuals hospitalized with spina bifida and the general population using data from the California State Inpatient Database from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project for 2004 of adults.Prevalence of spina bifida-sensitive conditions and ambulatory care-sensitive conditions as reason for hospitalization and 30-day readmission.As compared with the general population, persons with spina bifida who were hospitalized in 2004 had a significantly greater number of hospitalizations, number of hospitalizations associated with both spina bifida-sensitive conditions and ambulatory care-sensitive conditions, and number of 30-day readmissions. Stratification by age shows that the admissions for spina bifida sensitive conditions were greater in persons with spina bifida than in the general population for all age groups. In contrast, only in the youngest age group did those with spina bifida experience greater hospitalizations for ambulatory care-sensitive conditions.This study provides further evidence that persons with spina bifida have hospitalizations that are beyond what the general population experiences. These conditions may be potentially preventable with appropriate ambulatory care. This group also had a greater risk for readmission within 30 days of discharge from their last hospitalization. More research is needed on the efficacy of programs aimed at prevention of these conditions.
