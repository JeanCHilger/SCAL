Clinico-morphological characteristics of pulmonary mycobacteriosis. According to the criteria of the American Thoracal Societypulmonary mycobacteriosis has been diagnosed at 40patients without clinically important immunosupression (MAC--35%, Mkansasii--25%, M. xenopi--20%, M. fortuitum--12.5% and M. chelonae--7.5%). 95% patients have had clinically important symptomatology with polymorphic radiologic development such as a deformation of a lung pattern and focal dissemination (75%), locus and infiltration (52.5%), cavities (42.5%), marked pneumosclerosis (60%) and bronchiectasis (17.5%). 75% patients have had some changes of the bronhial tree. As opposed to tuberculosis the morphology of mycobacteriosis is more homogeneous and includes inflammation with epithelioid giant-cell granuloma and fibrosis, pneumogenic and bronchogenic cavernous cavities, mycobacterial endobronchitis. The polymorphism of clinic-radiologic developments, a similarity of lung diseases morphology caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria makes difficulties to diagnose theirs.
