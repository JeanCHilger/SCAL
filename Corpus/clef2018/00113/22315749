Masquerading pneumonia--pulmonary contusion. Pneumonia is diagnosed and treated with symptoms of fever, cough, expectoration and chest X ray showing evidence of consolidation. When a pattern of opacification does not fit into segmental or lobar pattern, reevaluation is essential. We report a case of 18 yr old boy with symptoms of respiratory infection, and X ray diagnosis suggestive of infective consolidation which turned out to be a case of pulmonary contusion.
