Neonatal group B streptococcal pneumonia and right-sided diaphragmatic hernia: report of one case. The symptoms of right-sided diaphragmatic hernia (RDH) rarely occur in the newborn period. The present report described a two-day-old neonate who presented with symptoms of respiratory distress and sepsis. Early onset group B beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GBBS) infection was diagnosed and RDH was found subsequently. A defect with smooth margin, sized 3 x 5 cm, located in posterior-lateral aspect of right diaphragm was observed during operation. After having been given antibiotics and surgical treatment, the infant recovered and was discharged in good condition. He has normal development at the age of one year. Possible pathogenesis is discussed in this report.
