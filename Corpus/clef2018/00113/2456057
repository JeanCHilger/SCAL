Systemic candidiasis and pneumonia in preterm infants. Twenty-two preterm infants with systemic candidiasis are reported, of which seven cases were presumed to be antenatally acquired and 15 postnatally acquired. All except one were of very low birthweight. Fifteen infants had positive cultures of blood, cerebrospinal fluid or urine and seven had candida pneumonia only. Clinical features included general instability, respiratory deterioration and a necrotizing enterocolitis-like presentation. The incidence of leukocytosis, shift to the left, eosinophilia and thrombocytopenia were not different from those with bacterial infection. The diagnosis was made after death in two infants. In the remaining 20 infants, treatment was initiated between 5 and 97 days of age, with a median delay of 4 days after the first positive cultures were taken. Complications of amphotericin and 5-flucytosine therapy which developed in five infants resolved on cessation of treatment. The mortality rate was 18% and impairment rate among the 17 very low birthweight survivors was 18%. A high index of suspicion is required for systemic candidiasis, especially in infants of less than 1000 g birthweight. If recognized early, effective and safe antifungal therapy is possible with favourable short- and long-term outcome.
