Severe staphylococcal sepsis in Nigerian children: a report of 27 cases. Twenty-seven children with severe staphylococcal sepsis were encountered over a 6-year period in a busy teaching hospital paediatric practice. The clinical manifestations are described, among which anaemia, osteomyelitis, lung infection and purulent pericarditis were most common. Osteomyelitis was particularly severe and multifocal in many of the children, leading to bone and joint deformity in some. Striking features were that all affected children were previously healthy, 83.3% had normal haemoglobin genotype AA and none had homozygous sickle cell haemoglobin SS.
