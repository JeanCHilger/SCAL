Evaluation of the cationic-lysosomal test in patients with pneumonia against a background of therapy. The authors' findings evidence that measurements of cationic protein levels is a sufficiently informative test in the complex of investigations that help predict the course of acute pneumonia and the therapeutic efficacy of drugs stimulating the nonspecific resistance of the body. Combined therapy with the use of methyluracil and eleutherococcus is more effective for pneumonia patients than the complex including aloe and antibacterial and symptomatic agents alone.
