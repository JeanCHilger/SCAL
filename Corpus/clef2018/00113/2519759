Familial outbreak of Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a pathogen of the human species which causes primarily acute respiratory diseases including pneumonia. It is transmitted from person through the respiration, and results in small epidemics. Most infected persons only develop pharyngitis or tracheobronchitis, whereas pneumonia develops in 3-30% depending on the age and characteristics of the evaluated group. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is the causative organism of 20% of community acquired pneumonias in the general population this proportion rises to 60% in closed groups and in individuals below age 20 years. Two cases of Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia identified in a single family are reported, together with a case of tracheobronchitis most likely caused by the same organism. The clinical, diagnostic, therapeutic and preventive approaches to the mycoplasma infections are discussed, and also the therapeutic approach to be recommended, in primary care, to young patients with pneumonia.
