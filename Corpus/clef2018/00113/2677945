Mycoplasmal pneumonias in childhood. Roentgen features, differential diagnosis and review of literature. The chest radiographs of 23 children, aged between 4.2 to 15.4 years with serologically proven mycoplasmal pneumonia were reviewed and correlated with the findings in literature. Three different patterns of infiltration were seen in equal frequency: 1) peribronchial and perivascular interstitial infiltrates, 2) patchy consolidations and 3) homogeneous acinar consolidations like groundglass. The lower fields of the lungs were mostly affected. Pattern 1 was always observed bilaterally. Enlargement of the hilar glands was a common finding. Pleural effusion was rare. Numerous differential diagnoses, especially viral pneumonias, feature the heterogeneity of the infiltration patterns. As no pattern is pathognomonic for mycoplasmal pneumonia clinical symptoms and signs, the epidemiological situation and laboratory data may confirm the diagnosis.
