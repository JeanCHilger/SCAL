The incidence of lung infection in patients with mucoviscidosis and the disease course with various pathogen spectra. A retrospective review on the frequency of lung infections by the most important organisms Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients with cystic fibrosis in the GDR during the period from 1981 to 1985 revealed an average infectious rate of 58.6 per cent by Staphylococcus and of 26.9 per cent by Pseudomonas respectively. A distinct increase of the infections by Pseudomonas could only be documented from 1981 to 1982, later on the infectious rate remained nearly equal and showed only a peak value of 35.6 per cent in 1983. Thus the frequency of infections by Pseudomonas is significantly lower in the GDR than in most other countries. The comparison of the course of the disease in patients with permanent lung infection during 4 or 5 years established a mortality rate of a double amount in the group of patients with Pseudomonas colonisation versus the group with Staphylococcus colonisation. Otherwise no significant difference could be stated in the mean age of the beginning of lung infection (Staphylococcus = 9.7 years of age - Pseudomonas = 10.1 years of age). Analysing the pulmonary x-ray findings we found a significantly more rapid deterioriation during the follow-up period in patients with permanent Pseudomonas infection than in patients with permanent Staphylococcus infection, whereas the evolution of body height and weight did not take different course.
