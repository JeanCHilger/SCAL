Morphological characteristics of acute respiratory tract diseases of mixed etiology in children. The analysis of 30 etiologically deciphered (by the direct Coons method) autopsy observations of acute respiratory diseases in children under 8 is presented. Monoinfections were established only in 6 cases. Morphological examinations of respiratory organs in 24 cases of mixed acute respiratory diseases (associations of virus-bacteria and virus-Mycoplasma pneumoniae-diplostreptococcus) revealed marked circulatory disorders and desquamative, dystrophic, and inflammatory processes in segmental bronchi, bronchioles and alveoles. Morphometric studies demonstrated statistically significant differences in the cell composition of infiltrates of interalveolar septa in monoinfections and associated infections.
