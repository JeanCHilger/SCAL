Increased IgG2 and IgG3 concentration is associated with advanced Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection and poor pulmonary function in cystic fibrosis. The concentrations of IgG subclass immunoglobulins were determined by radial immunodiffusion in serum from 126 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). The results were compared to values from age-matched healthy children and adults and correlated to patients age, duration of chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection and lung function parameters. Fifty-two percent of the patients had an elevated concentration of at least one of the IgG subclasses IgG1 28%, IgG2 16%, IgG3 18% and IgG4 48%. There was significant correlation between elevated serum levels of IgG2, and to a lesser extent IgG3, with decreased lung function (for FEV1
