Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae specific immunoglobulin M. An ELISA was developed for the detection of IgM antibodies to Mycoplasma pneumoniae in human sera, using microtiter plates coated with rabbit antiserum to human IgM selecting for IgM antibodies in the first reaction step. The specific antibodies were detected using enzyme-labelled, detergent-solubilized antigen. The complement fixation test was used as reference method. In a prospective study of 59 patients with community-acquired pneumonia, 13 of whom had evidence of mycoplasmal etiology, the ELISA was shown to have high specificity (97%). In samples taken seven days after onset of the disease all complement-fixation positive samples (n = 20) but one were positive, demonstrating the diagnostic value of a positive test in samples taken after that period.
