Intrathoracic manifestations of sickle cell disease. A retrospective analysis of 50 patients with sickle cell disease was performed. The majority of patients was admitted because of sickle cell crisis, pneumonia or congestive heart failure. Global cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular engorgement, pneumonia and infiltrative lung parenchymal abnormalities were encountered. Our study shows a very high prevalence of intrathoracic abnormalities in patients afflicted with sickle cell disease.
