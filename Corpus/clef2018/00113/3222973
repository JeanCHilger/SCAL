Bacteriological findings in bronchial secretions of children with chronic, nontuberculous lung diseases and their relationship to local transferrin values. In 142 bronchial secretions from 63 children with chronic nontuberculous lung diseases the content of transferrin was studied. In 68 samples (= 48%) transferrin has been found in concentrations between 0.1 and 13.9 mg/100 mg total protein. Fifty six of the secretions were analysed bacteriologically, microbes have been isolated in 37 of them (66%). Of the detected bacteria 5 species were considered as potentially pathogenic. The bacterial growth has been shown more frequently in secretions of patients with heavily inflamed bronchial mucosa. In bacterially contaminated secretions the occurrence of transferrin was reduced.
