Bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia in Sweden: clinical course and outcome and comparison with non-bacteremic pneumococcal and mycoplasmal pneumonias. 279 patients with 285 episodes of bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia (Pnb), treated at the 2 departments for infectious diseases in Stockholm, Sweden, were reviewed retrospectively. Almost half of all episodes were caused by serotypes 3, 9 and 4 (in that order). The overall mortality rate was 7% and as low as 5% if patients with extrapulmonary complications were excluded. As in other studies male sex, alcoholism and absence of leukocytosis on admission to hospital were all associated with a higher mortality rate. However, the prognosis for old patients was much better than in most other studies. This was true also when the infecting strain was of serotype 3. For 89 consecutive patients out of the 279 ones with Pnb the clinical, laboratory and chest X-ray data were compared with those of 44 patients with non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia (Pn) and 27 patients with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MP). Within the pneumococcal group almost all non-bacteremic patients had respiratory tract symptoms compared to less than half of the patients with bacteremic disease. High age, alcoholism, chills, pleuritic chest pain, a leukocyte count of greater than 15 x 10(9)l and an elevated CRP were factors significantly more common among those with pneumococcal pneumonia than among the MP patients. On chest X-ray an alveolar pattern was seen in all but 2 of the totally 133 patients with a pneumococcal pneumonia, but also in half the patients with MP.
