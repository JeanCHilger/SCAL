AIDS complications of the lung. AIDS represents a virus-induced disturbance of the cell-determined immunity which is seen in ever increasing numbers of cases even in Europe. AIDS occurs in certain risk groups. Clinically the first symptoms of the disease which are seen are pulmonary, bouts of fever, unproductive coughing, dyspnoea whilst dullness, bronchospasmus and an increase in sputum production are rare. Interstitial infiltrates do not contain plasma cells. In X-ray pictures striped shadows, atypical lobular infiltrates and pleural fluid are not uncommon as is also the case in other atypical pneumonias. As a rule the pulmonary function-test shows a reduced DCO but this is not specific.
