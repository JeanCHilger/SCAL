Stevens-Johnson syndrome associated with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. Apropos of a pediatric case. A 13 years old girl presented an acute episode of fever, productive cough, purulent rhinorrhea and bilateral pulmonary crepitant rales. 36 hours later a maculopapular eruption appeared on the face, extended to all body and became bullous. Pluriorificial mucous membranes lesions were associated (conjunctivae, buccal mucosa, lips, nasal mucosa, genitalia and the perirectal area). Parenteral prednisone was administered and the extension of the eruption was stopped in a few hours. Lesions healed in about 10 days. Association with mycoplasma pneumoniae was documented by serologic studies (high titers of complement fixing antibodies and presence of IgM antibodies in immunofluorescence).
