Management of infections of the lower respiratory tract in children. Different microorganisms can cause similar clinical patterns of lower respiratory tract disease, and a variety of clinical presentations can be caused by the same organism. Nevertheless by considering such factors as epidemiology, patient age, manifestations of nonrespiratory diseases, state of nutrition and course of illness, the physician can make reasonable assumptions as to the etiology of a child's respiratory infection. On this basis he or she can make a rational choice of initial therapy. The patient's response to treatment, as well as information gained from laboratory and radiographic studies, if available, can be used to change the management plan as necessary.
