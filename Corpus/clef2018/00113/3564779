Microflora of the upper respiratory tract of normal young children and in respiratory tract diseases. Normal microflora and dysbiosis at different levels of the upper respiratory tract in healthy children and pneumonia patients. Material obtained from the mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract (the anterior section of the nasal cavity, the fauces) in young children, both healthy and suffering with different forms of acute pneumonia, has been analyzed with due regard to the structure of the microflora, its specific composition and the size of populations formed by different species constituting the microflora. This analysis has made it possible to determine the species constituting normal microflora, to detect its dysbiotic changes, and to determine their degree (partial or complete dysbacteriosis). The degree of pathologic changes in the microecological balance of the upper respiratory tract has been shown to reflect the severity of acute pneumonia and to be determined by the characteristics of the natural resistance system in young children.
