Tolerance of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination in the child. Forty children all aged over 2 years and eutrophic were treated with the combination amoxycillin and clavulanic acid for various infections (twenty-three with meningitis, eleven with bronchial pneumonia, three with typhoid fever, two with lower urinary tract infections and one with ear infection of moderate severity). Nine of these patients had sickness during treatment which was mild and transient in the majority of cases and caused treatment to be stopped in only one case (2.5%). This low level of gastric tolerance should not concern the paediatrician faced with an infection due to (or most likely to be) a beta-lactamase producing micro-organism.
