Open lung biopsy in patients with acute leukemia. The results of open lung biopsy in 15 patients with acute leukemia, pulmonary infiltrates, neutropenia, and fever were reviewed. The patients averaged 26 hospital days of neutropenia and 20 hospital days of fever before open lung biopsy, and all patients received broad-spectrum antibacterial agents (mean 17 days) before open lung biopsy. Nine (67 percent) received amphotericin B prior to open lung biopsy (mean 22 days). Open lung biopsy yielded a specific clinically helpful diagnosis in six patients, but only two of these patients survived the hospitalization during which open lung biopsy was performed. Open lung biopsy detected fungus in four patients and leukemic infiltrates in two patients. Management was appropriately modified in these patients. In nine patients, a specific diagnosis of the pulmonary infiltrate was not obtained by open lung biopsy. Antimicrobial regimens were not changed substantially for these patients. In six patients, the results of open lung biopsy may have been misleading. Two patients had pulmonary fungal diseases at autopsy, undetected by open lung biopsy eight days and five weeks prior to death. Another patient had invasive aspergillosis and one had cytomegalovirus pneumonitis not detected by open lung biopsy. Two patients had false-positive preliminary histologic reports of pulmonary infection. On the basis of this experience, in this specific population of patients, open lung biopsy was often of little help in directing medical therapy or influencing clinical outcome.
