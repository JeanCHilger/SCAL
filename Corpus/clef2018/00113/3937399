Circulating immune complexes in the diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. The possibility of detecting M. pneumoniae antigen and antibodies to it, incorporated into immune complexes, in the sera of patients with acute pneumonia by means of erythrocyte diagnosticums was studied, and the immunological characterization of these complexes was made. In patients with mycoplasmal pneumonia M. pneumoniae antigen and specific antibodies, both free and incorporated into immune complexes, were found to circulate in the blood. In children, antigenemia was detected twice as frequently as in adults. Dissociated M. pneumoniae antigens had different molecular weight, their location on the gel chromatogram of the serum being in fractions 7S and 19S. The dissociation of immune complexes permits the detection of M. pneumoniae antigen and antibodies to it in a bound state by means of the passive hemagglutination test, thus increasing the frequency of positive results in the diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection.
