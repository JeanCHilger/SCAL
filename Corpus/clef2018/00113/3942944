Value of the lateral radiologic view of the chest in children with acute pulmonary illness. Although expert committees have questioned the usefulness of lateral radiologic views of the chest without specific indications, many physicians commonly order both posteroanterior and lateral views in assessing pediatric patients who have signs and symptoms of acute chest disease. To investigate the usefulness of lateral view in children, three experienced physicians independently reviewed and interpreted the posteroanterior view alone and the posteroanterior and lateral views for 179 children 1 to 10 years of age. The films were made between 1980 and 1982 at McMaster University Medical Centre, Hamilton, Ont. A high level of agreement was found between the interpretations based on the posteroanterior view alone and those based on both views. Addition of the lateral view did not improve agreement between the interpretations and the final hospital chart radiologic diagnosis in a clinically significant manner, nor did the lateral view improve the accuracy of localization of radiologic abnormalities. Obtaining a lateral view whenever radiologic examination of the chest is indicated but when specific indications are lacking is unlikely to prove useful to experienced physicians in diagnosing and managing acute pulmonary illness in children.
