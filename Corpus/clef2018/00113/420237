Diffuse pulmonary infiltrates in immunosuppressed patients. Prospective study of 80 cases. Over a two year period, we studied prospectively 80 cases of diffuse pneumonia at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. In 72 per cent of these, the patient had leukemia or lymphoma. Diagnostic procedures consisted of extensive serologic testing for antibody to known respiratory pathogens, including the agent of Legionnaire's disease, and culturing of biopsy specimens for bacteria, viruses, mycoplasmas and fungi. Of 44 cases in which open lung biopsy was performed, a specific cause was found in 61.4 per cent: Pneumocystis carinii in 38.6 per cent, other infections in 9.1 per cent and tumor involvement in 13.7 per cent. There were nonspecific pulmonary changes in 38.6 per cent. Of the 56 cases in which biopsy, autopsy or both were performed, a specific diagnosis was made in 69.7 per cent: P. carinii infection in 37.5 per cent and other infections in 12.5 per cent. In cases in which neither biopsy nor autopsy was performed, a specific infection was diagnosed in 33 per cent no specific diagnosis was made in the remainder. One patient in the entire group had a significant antibody titer for Legionnaire's disease. Although diagnostic in some cases, extensive serologic testing proved relatively unfruitful. Pneumocystosis was the most frequent diagnosis in this study. The cause of some cases remained obscure, even after lung biopsy.
