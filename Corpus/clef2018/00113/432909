Pedi-pack transfusion in a newborn intensive care unit. Two hundred and ninety-one transfusions using 221 pediatric frozen red blood cell packs (Pedi-Packs) were given to 141 newborn babies and infants in the newborn intensive care unit. In 18 patients, 47 transfusions were studied for transfusion and clinical characteristics. Two possible hemolytic episodes are described in detail and remain unexplained. Blood loss for laboratory tests was found to average 3.1 ml/kg per day spent in the newborn intensive care unit. The rise in hematocrit was found to be excellent. Overall, the transfusion of thawed pediatric red blood cell packs was found to be convenient, safe and effective. Because of pretesting possibilities with the use of this source of red blood cells, one of the problems associated with a walking donor program is eliminated.
