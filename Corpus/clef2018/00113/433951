Infections due to group C streptococci in man. Although a common cause of infection in animals, group C streptococci are rarely noted to be pathogenic in man. A total of 150,000 blood cultures obtained at the Mayo Clinic from 1968 to 1977 revealed group C streptococci in only eight patients. Acute bacterial endocarditis, meningitis, pheumonia, cellulitis and bacteremia due to group C streptococci are described in a host who had undergone immunosuppression (immunosuppressed host), and the relatively few cases previously reported are reviewed. Although severe, these infections may respond favorably to penicillin therapy. Endocarditis caused by group D streptococci is acute and destructive, and associated with early cardiac decompensation. The manifestations of cellulitis and pneumonia are similar to those when group A streptococci are causative organisms. Meningitis due to group C streptococci is acute and severe, and responds slowly to antimicrobial therapy. Colonization also occurs.
