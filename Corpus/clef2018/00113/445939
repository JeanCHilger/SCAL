Review of intensive care unit admissions for asthma. A review of ICU admissions for asthma to the Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles was conducted for the period January 1969 through July 1977. The admission rate remained relatively constant during this period. Patients requiring ICU admission tended to be young, intractable severe asthmatics whose asthma started at a very young age. There were three patients who had no previous history of asthma. The incidence of pneumonitis/atelectasis was somewhat greater than has been reported for patients hospitalized for status asthmaticus. A significant number of children received neither intravenous corticosteriods, sympathomimetics nor oxygen therapy while hospitalized prior to transfer to the ICU. Those children receiving mechanical ventilation or intravenous isoproterenol tended to be somewhat younger and had a higher incidence of pneumonitis/atelectasis and more abnormal blood gas determinations than their counterparts who were not similarly treated. Mechanical ventilation was administered to 15 patients and 19 patients received intravenous isoproterenol. Intravenous isoproterenol resulted in prompt improvement in most patients except for one patient who experienced cardiac arrhythmia (reversed when the dosage was decreased), this medication was well-tolerated.
