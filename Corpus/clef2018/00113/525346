Pneumonia associated with Chlamydia trachomatis infection in an infant. Chlamydia trachomatis was isolated from the epipharynx of a 10-week-old baby girl taken ill with pneumonia but without signs of conjunctivitis. The infant developed specific antibodies to the organism. The course of the pneumonia was protracted, with cough and tachypnea. The baby, who was afebrile, improved on antibiotic therapy but pulmonary infiltrates persisted for several months. To our knowledge, this is the first case of pneumonia in an infant associated with C. trachomatis infection reported elsewhere than North America.
