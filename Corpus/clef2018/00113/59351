Gastrointestinal changes in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia. Three cases of hypogammaglobulinemia are described. In all cases the first symptoms of disease manifesting as pneumonia were preceded by diarrhea. In gastric biopsy there was atrophic gastritis with lack of plasmocytes. All patients demonstrated gastric achylia and symptoms of malabsorption syndrome. The causes of gastrointestinal changes, most probably infections, with simultaneous defective mucosal barrier are discussed.
