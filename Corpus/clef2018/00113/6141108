Chlamydia trachomatis in term pregnancy. isolation and serological study with a case report. The prevalence of cervical Chlamydia trachomatis infection in healthy, symptomless full-term pregnant women (n = 92) was found to be low (1.1%). Chlamydial cervical IgA antibodies, as measured by solid-phase radioimmunoassay (RIA), were found in 5.3%, but amniotic fluid chlamydial RIA IgA antibodies were almost absent. Serum IgG antibodies were measured with indirect immunofluorescence (IF). Of the mothers 9.8% had a titer greater than or equal to 1:64, correlating closely with the figure of 10.9% for infants' cord-blood IF serology. Finally, a case report is presented. A child born to a Chlamydia trachomatis positive mother developed isolation positive chlamydial pneumonia.
