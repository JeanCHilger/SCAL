Multiple pulmonary complications in a patient with Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Since first described in 1922, Stevens-Johnson syndrome has been associated frequently with pneumonia of many etiologies. This "mucosal respiratory syndrome," first reported by Stanyon and Warner in 1945, is associated with "early" pneumonia which resolves 2 to 3 weeks after onset of the rash. In our patient, pneumonia began 10 days after rash onset and was nearly resolved by day 20. The unique feature of this case was the onset of late pulmonary complications 25 days after the appearance of the exanthem, manifesting as acute noninfectious interstitial disease with superimposed airway obstruction.
