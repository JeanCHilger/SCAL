Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection associated with ectodermosis pluriorificialis: a report of two cases. Two children (4 and 12 years old) presented with a Stevens-Johnson syndrome. The symptoms and their evolution were remarkably similar. In both cases, a Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was suspected after a serolgic study. This etiology, still unfamiliar, must be suspected in presence of severe stomatitis in children.
