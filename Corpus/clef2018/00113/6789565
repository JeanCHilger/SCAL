Prophylactic and therapeutic intermittent positive pressure breathing with combined therapeutic aerosols (IPPB/I)--functional and morphological effects. I. Functional effects of prophylactic IPPB/I (author's transl). Intermittent positive pressure breathing combined with therapeutic aerosol inhalation (IPPB/I) was applied to improve the preoperative respiratory function and to prevent postoperative pulmonary complications in patients with carcinoma. No significant improvement in ventilation, arterial PO2, and load-carrying could be shown after prophylactical application of IPPB/I for 7 days. A distinct decrease of arterial PO2 was seen immediately after IPPB/I. Further investigations are necessary to improve the method.
