Familial cutaneous amyloidosis with systemic manifestations in males. We describe a family in which two males and seven females have brown pigmentation of the skin. In the females, the type and distribution of the pigmentation mimicked incontinentia pigmenti in the males, the pattern was reticulate. The histological appearance was the same in both sexes with amyloid deposits in the papillary dermis, melanin in the basal layer, and slight hyperkeratosis. The females were otherwise normal. Both males had thrived poorly as infants but had survived. One had severe gastroenteritis with blood in the stools starting at the age of three weeks followed by seizures, hemiplegia, and developmental delay
