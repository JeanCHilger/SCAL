Characteristics of the viral and bacterial associations in acute pneumonias in children. The results obtained in the study of children with acute pneumonia in Frunze (761 live patients and 125 children who had died of this disease) revealed the prevalence of viro-bacterial associations: they were detected in 72.4% of cases of acute pneumonia without lethal termination and in 100% of cases with lethal termination. Most of the pathogenic or opportunistic bacteria isolated from the live patients with acute pneumonia were associated with influenza, parainfluenza and adenovirus infections, while in the children who had died of this disease mixed viro-viral or viro-mycoplasmic associations prevailed. Viro-bacterial associations detected in children with acute pneumonia comprised most frequently influenza, infection in the cold season and adenovirus and mycoplasmic infections in the warm season.
