Infections in leukemic children: a prospective analysis. A 28-month prospective study of 54 leukemic children was carried out to determine the incidence and type of infection associated with febrile episodes. Fever was caused by infections in 84 of 199 episodes (71%). Two-thirds of the febrile episodes and 57% of the documented infections occurred when leukemic activity was demonstrable. However, only nine of 29 febrile episodes which occurred at the time of initial diagnosis of acute leukemia were due to infection. All serious bacterial infections occurred in children with absolute granulocyte counts less than 500/mm3. Septicemia was responsible for seven of the 17 deaths which occurred during the period of observation. The five children with Pseudomonas infections were colonized 10 to 30 days before they developed their infection. The majority of viral infections occurred in patients in remission, and were principally caused by cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster virus, or Epstein-Barr virus. With the exception of one patient who died with a complex infection (CMV and Pneumocystis carinii), the children in this study responded well to viral infections.
