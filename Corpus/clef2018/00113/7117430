Abnormalities in lung function following clinical recovery from Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia. Pulmonary function was studied in 15 patients who had clinically and radiologically recovered from proven Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia, 21 weeks (mean) previously. Ten patients were tested again 43 weeks (mean) later. Lung volumes and measurements of airways resistance were generally normal. Transfer factor and diffusion constant were initially reduced in the smokers and significantly improved between the two studies, being normal at the second testing. It is suggested smokers take longer to recover from mycoplasma pneumonia although all cases had returned to normal a year after the illness.
