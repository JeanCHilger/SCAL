Passive K+-permeability of the erythrocyte membrane in healthy infants and those with pneumonia in the 1st months of life on different feeding regimens. In normal children of the first 6 months of life the erythrocyte membrane stability assessed from the characteristics of its passive K+-permeability depends on the feeding pattern. The greater stability is observed upon natural feeding while the least upon feeding by means of cow's milk dilution. Apparently, varying stability of cell membranes lies at the basis of appreciable disorders of membranes permeability during acute pneumonia in children kept on irrational feeding (with simple mixtures). Thus, in this group of the patients, there are higher indicators of passive K+-permeability of the erythrocyte membrane and the most significant changes in some of the characteristics of bioenergetic processes (intracellular content of potassium, ATP, transmembranous potassium distribution ratio).
