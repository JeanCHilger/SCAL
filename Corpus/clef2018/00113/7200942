Passive smoking. Before 1980 the argument that passive smoking was a serious health hazard was rather tenuous. It was claimed that it produced allergic reactions, impaired driving ability, reduced exercise tolerance in patients with cardiorespiratory disease and increased the risk of bronchitis and pneumonia in first-year children. However, none of these claims provided convincing evidence relevant to the normal healthy adult nonsmoker. Many studies indicate that nonsmokers are unlikely to inhale more than a very small amount of those components of tobacco smoke traditionally considered harmful. It was surprising, therefore, when a study carried out in the USA showed reduced airways function and studies from Japan and Greece showed an increased lung cancer incidence, in nonsmokers passively exposed to tobacco smoke in comparison with nonsmokers not so exposed. A review of the detail of these studies suggests that none provides conclusive evidence that passive smoking is seriously harmful, a view supported by a recent large study that was carried out in the USA and in which no significant relationship was found between passive smoking and lung cancer. More research is urgently needed, particularly to explore the influence of potentially confounding factors.
