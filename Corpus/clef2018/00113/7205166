Delayed roentgenographic signs associated with acute pneumonia in children. Three cases are reported in order to emphasize occult presentations of pneumonia in children. In each hospitalized child, the initial chest roentgenogram was negative, only to become positive up to five years after presentation. Possible explanations for delayed roentgenographic signs of pneumonia are discussed. Less common signs and symptoms of pneumonia in children of various ages are outlined in order to increase the awareness of primary care physicians to atypical presentation of pneumonia in childhood.
