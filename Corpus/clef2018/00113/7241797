Clinical studies on dry filled doxycycline for intravenous administration including one case of tsutsugamushi disease (author's transl). On a new dry filled doxycycline derivative for intravenous administration, some clinical studies were performed. The results obtained were summarized as follows 1. Intravenous administration was effective in three cases of pulmonary abscess, in one case of bronchopneumonia, in one case of urinary tract infection complicated to nephrolithiasis, in one case of Mycoplasma pneumonia and in one case of tsutsugamushi disease. 2. In one case of FUO (fever of unknown origin), in one case of non-bacterial meningitis and in one case of ampicillin induced hemorrhagic colitis, from whom Klebsiella oxytoca was isolated in feces, satisfactory clinical course was observed with the drug administration. However, as it was impossible to give any comments for the causative agent of each disease, the effectiveness of the derivative was not necessarily clear. 3. Neither side effects nor abnormal laboratory finding caused by the derivative were noticed in any cases.
