Pulmonary function abnormalities in asymptomatic children after hydrocarbon pneumonitis. To assess the effect of hydrocarbon pneumonitis on the developing lung, we studied the pulmonary function of 17 asymptomatic children, 8 to 14 years after the initial insult. Fourteen of the 17 subjects (82%) had one or more pulmonary function abnormalities, the most frequent being a high volume of isoflow. Volume of isoflow, ratio residual volume to total lung capacity, slope of phase III, flow rates at 50% and 25% of vital capacity and 60% of the total lung capacity, one-second forced expiratory volume, and maximum midexpiratory flow rate differed significantly (P less than .05) from values in control groups. Closing volume and closing capacity were not significantly different. Residual abnormalities present in children after hydrocarbon pneumonitis can be explained on the basis of small airway obstruction and/or loss of elastic recoil. These children may be at risk for the development of chronic lung disease as adults when they are exposed to exogenous factors such as air pollution or smoking.
