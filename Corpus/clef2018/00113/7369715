Mycoplasma antibody in Guillain-Barré syndrome and other neurological disorders. Counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIEP) was used to determine precipitating antibodies to Mycoplasma pneumoniae retrospectively in sera from 100 patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), 125 medical and neurological controls, and 40 normal individuals. Sera from 7 patients produced precipitin lines. These positive cases included 5 patients with GBS, 1 with acute cerebellar ataxia, and 1 with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. A complement-fixation test performed with the same antigen showed titers to M. pneumoniae of 1:512 or greater in these 7 sera. In contrast, sera from other patient controls and normal individuals were negative by CIEP and had only low mycoplasma complement-fixation antibody titers. No distinguishing clinical features separated the 5 seropositive GBS patients from the whole group except for their young age, which parallels that for human mycoplasma infection in general. Additional laboratory findings consistent with acute mycoplasma infection were demonstrated in 6 of the 7 seropositive patients.
