Two patients with recurrent pneumonias in one lung. Case histories are described of two young patients, both known to have recurrent infections of one pulmonary lobe. Further investigations (especially aortography) disclosed the cause in both to be an intrapulmonary sequestration. Surgical intervention made both patients symptom-free. The aetiology, clinical and investigational findings as well as therapy are discussed. The need for further investigations in patients with recurring infections of one pulmonary lobe is stressed.
