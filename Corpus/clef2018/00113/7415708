Epileptic syndrome in nonspecific inflammatory diseases of the lungs. The author presents the data of clinical and electrophysiological observations of 6 patients (out of 300) with acute pneumonia and 9 patients (out of 89) with chronic nonspecific inflammatory diseases of the lungs accompanied by the epileptic syndrome that developed for the first time. In those patients the convulsive seizure did not differ in their character from those observed in cases of classic epilepsy. The course of the convulsive seizures, especially at the early stages of the disease, depended on the degree of the clinical manifestations of the acute and chronic pulmonary pathology. An analysis of the results obtained showed that the pathogenetic mechanisms of the epileptic syndrome in the acute stage and in exacerbations of the chronic nonspecific diseases were formed of intoxication, hypoxia, hematoliquordynamic disturbances, and signs of cerebral and meningeal edema, the disturbances of the cerebrospinal liquor dynamics being of a particular importance.
