Pathological anatomy of acute respiratory diseases and their significance in pediatric lethality. A high proportion of pneumonias (43.6%) as the main disease is demonstrated on the material of 936 deaths in children. Mixed viral-bacterial pneumonias are prevalent, viral pneumonias being found in 5% of deaths. The attention is drawn to the possibility of simultaneous or consecutive infection with viruses and bacteria. When pneumonias develop, of great importance is the frequently observed virus latency. It is emphasized that additional methods (bacteriological, bacterioscopic, cytological, immunofluorescent) should be used in pathological practice for the elucidation of the cause of pneumonias. When the infection is generalized, a significant role is played by the involvement of the brain, kidneys, liver, and other organs.
