Chlamydia trachomatis as pathogen in pneumonia in a newborn infant (author's transl). A report is given of a newborn who developed signs of hepatitis two weeks after a normal birth, and only later respiratory symptoms of pneumonia. The infant had pronounced tachypnea, incresed immunoglobulins, eosinophilia and leucocytosis. X-rays in the initial stages showed interstitial infiltrates with alveolar hyperaeration, and in the later stages patchy alveolar infiltrates. Chlamydia trachomatis was cultured from the tracheal secretion. In making a differential diagnosis in cases of neonatal pneumonia infection with trachomatis must thus also be considered.
