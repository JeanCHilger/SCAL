Mortality rate of influenza, acute respiratory diseases and acute pneumonia as a health status factor. The rates of mortality due to influenza, acute respiratory disease and acute pneumonia were studied in relation to the patients' age, sex, epidemic etiology. Quantitative characteristics of excess mortality might be used in the assessment of the influenza epidemic intensity. The most vulnerable groups of the population were identified in whom a comprehensive complex of measures should be made to reduce ARD mortality rates.
