Immunological criteria in the differential diagnosis of lung diseases. Immunological examination performed in 292 patients with pulmonary diseases which presented difficulties for differential diagnosis has shown essential differences in immunological status of tuberculous, pneumonia and cancer patients. The fact that immunological abnormalities were related to X-ray characteristics of the lesion made it possible to develop each X-ray syndrome-specific criteria of distinguishing tuberculosis from other pulmonary lesions. The advance of the disease caused unidirectional changes in immunograms for various pulmonary lesions. There is evidence of enhanced cell response to tuberculin in patients suffering from nontuberculous pulmonary lesions.
