Necrobacillosis (Lemmiere's syndrome): a rare cause of necrotizing pneumonia. The cases of four young and previously healthy patients with necrobacillosis are reported. All four patients presented with acute pharyngotonsillitis and pulmonary infiltrates due to metastatic abscesses, and had neutrophil leucocytosis and hypoalbuminaemia. Blood cultures grew Fusobacterium necrophorum and each patient responded to metronidazole.
