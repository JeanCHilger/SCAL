Effect of IL-1 blockade on inflammatory manifestations of acute ventilator-induced lung injury in a rabbit model. Ventilator-induced lung injury in children and adults is characterized by an initial inflammatory phase. To investigate whether the inflammatory cytokine, IL-1, plays a role in this process, a rabbit model of ventilator-induced injury was created. Animals maintained under pentobarbital anesthesia were primed for injury by undergoing lung lavage with 22 mL/kg of saline and then ventilated for 8 h with either FIO2 0.21 and normal pressures or FIO2 1.0 and high ventilator pressures. The animals exposed to hyperoxia/hyperventilation demonstrated a greater increase in lung lavage neutrophil counts and a higher histological injury score, as well as a faster decline in oxygenation compared to the control animals. A third group of rabbits received 800 micrograms of recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist after lung lavage and prior to the exposure to FIO2 1.0 and high ventilator pressures. These animals had significantly lower concentrations of albumin and elastase and lower neutrophil counts in their lungs after the 8-h ventilatory period compared to hyperoxia/hyperventilation rabbits. IL-1 blockade had no effect on the decline in dynamic compliance and oxygenation seen in saline-treated hyperoxic/hyperventilated rabbits. IL-1 is a mediator of acute inflammation due to ventilator-induced lung injury.
