A criterion based audit of community-acquired pneumonia. We undertook a prospective audit of patients admitted to a specialist respiratory unit in order to assess: (a) the completeness of the objective assessment of severity of community-acquired pneumonia in patients on admission to hospital, and whether such indices were useful in predicting outcome (b) the completeness of microbiological testing and whether maximizing the number of specimens sent to the laboratory would increase the frequency of positive microbiological diagnoses andThe standard of initial assessment was high in this specialist unit, and the presence of two or more 'markers of severity' did help predict outcome. A simple change in work practice resulted in a significant improvement in the thoroughness of microbiological investigations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
