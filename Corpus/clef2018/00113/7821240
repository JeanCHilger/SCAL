HIV seropositivity in children admitted with diarrhoea at Eldoret District Hospital, Kenya. Fifty seven children aged 2 years and below admitted to Paediatric ward of Eldoret District Hospital with a diagnosis of diarrhoea were studied for HIV infection. A total of 29 (50.9%) cases were found to be positive with no gender difference. 17 (70.8%) of 24 cases with diarrhoea of over 14 days duration were positive for HIV compared to 12 (36.7%) cases out of 33 cases with diarrhoea of less than 14 days' duration. There was a high (80%) prevalence of HIV positivity rate in patients who presented with pneumonia and malnutrition in addition to diarrhoea when compared to children who presented with diarrhoea and vomiting alone (44.1%).All children 2 years and younger with diagnosis of gastroenteritis (diarrhea and vomiting) admitted to the Eldoret District Hospital between the February and June 1992 were enrolled. ELISA test was performed for HIV for each of the 57 children. In addition, relevant tests were carried out in all cases, such as hemogram, stool for ova and cysts, blood slide for malaria parasites, and urinalysis. The ELISA results were confirmed by the Western blot for all positive cases. A total of 57 children, 32 (56.1%) males and 25 (43.9%) females were studied. All the children were 2 years or younger, with 61.4% under 9 months old. The difference with respect to distribution of HIV positivity and negativity in those under 9 months and those above 9 months was significant (p  0.001). 29 of the 57 infants (50.9%) were ELISA and Western blot positive. Of the positive cases, 23 (79.3%) were 9 months or younger, with 6 (20.7%) between 9 months and 24 months (p  0.001). Of the 33 (58.3%) patients with diarrhea of less than 14 days' duration, 12 (36.70%) were seropositive, and of the 24 (41.7%) with diarrhea of more than 14 days, 17 (70.8%) were HIV positive. The difference in the duration of diarrhea in both the positive and negative cases in the 2 groups was significant. There were 34 patients who presented with diarrhea and vomiting alone of whom 15 (44.1%) were positive for HIV, while there were 10 who presented with diarrhea and either malnutrition or pneumonia with 8 (80%) positive for HIV. Diarrhea lasting more than 14 days was a significant parameter, as 70.8% of the patients in this category were seropositive for HIV compared to 36.7% in those with diarrhea of less than 14 days' duration (p   0.02). In addition, children 0-9 months old had a higher incidence of HIV seropositivity than the older age group, especially the age group 5-9 months, 73.6% of whom were seropositive.
