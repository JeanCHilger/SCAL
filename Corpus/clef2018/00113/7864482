Group A streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis: cost-effective diagnosis and treatment. Most patients who seek medical attention for sore throat are concerned about streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis, but fewer than 10% of adults and 30% of children actually have a streptococcal infection. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GAS) are most often responsible for bacterial tonsillopharyngitis, although Neisseria gonorrhea, Arcanobacterium haemolyticum (formerly Corynebacterium haemolyticum), Chlamydia pneumoniae (TWAR agent), and Mycoplasma pneumoniae have also been suggested as possible, infrequent, sporadic pathogens. Viruses or idiopathic causes account for the remainder of sore throat complaints. Reliance on clinical impression to diagnose GAS tonsillopharyngitis is problematic an overestimation of 80% to 95% by experienced clinicians typically occurs for adult patients. Overtreatment promotes bacterial resistance, disturbs natural microbial ecology, and may produce unnecessary side effects. Existing data suggest that rapid GAS antigen testing as an aid to clinical diagnosis can be very useful. When used appropriately, it is sensitive (79% to 88%) in detecting GAS-infected patients and is specific (90% to 96%) and cost-effective. Penicillin has been the treatment of choice for GAS tonsillopharyngitis since the 1950s
