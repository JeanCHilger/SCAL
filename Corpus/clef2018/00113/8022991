The prognostic factors of mortality in community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization. The prognostic influence on mortality of parameters available in an emergency Unit is studied in patients with acquired community pneumonia (ACP) requiring hospitalization. Three hundred and thirty patients admitted consecutively from the emergency unit of a general hospital were evaluated. Radiological, analytical, clinical, and demographic data were recorded. The parameters associated with greater mortality were: age, absence of thoracic pain, obnubilation, hypotension, elevation in urea, GOT, GPT, LDH, decrease in prothrombin activity, pO2, pH, albumin, and the affectation of more than one lobe in a radiography of the thorax. Considering the parameters associated with a higher relative risk (age > 65 years, urea > 50 mg/dl, LDH > 460 U/l and prothrombin < 70%), the presence of three or four of these variables shaved a sensibility of 59 percent and a specificity of 93 percent in predicting mortality. In the multivariant analysis remained as significant: age, obnubilation, elevation in LDH, and decrease in the activity of prothrombin and pH. Appropriate knowledge of the prognostic factors in CAP allows for early determination of patients who require special attention in both diagnosis and in treatment upon hospitalization.
