The use of a polymerase chain reaction method for the diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumonia. The assay system for the diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections, based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR), has been developed. The sensitivity of the detection of M. pneumoniae DNA in analysis of different clinical samples has been established. The study has shown the possibility of using the newly developed assay system for the detection of M. pneumoniae in the material obtained from patients with atypical forms of pneumonia and from Mycoplasma carriers.
