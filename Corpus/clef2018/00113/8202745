Mothers' perceptions of severe pneumonia in their own children: a controlled study in Pakistan. In 1992, 320 mothers were interviewed in a Rawalpindi hospital to identify which of the signs and symptoms they saw in their own children were most consistently linked with a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia as opposed to common cold. A related goal was to determine whether mothers could correctly judge the actual presence or absence of two major pneumonia signs--fast breathing and chest indrawing. The mothers were predominantly poor and 43% were illiterate. The study sample was composed of four matched groups: (1) mothers of 80 children with pneumonia, most with severe disease, interviewed after the child was referred to the ward (2) mothers of 80 such children interviewed in the outpatient clinic prior to any discussion of the pneumonia diagnosis
