The characteristics of the pneumonias found in those who die in the postoperative period. A clinicomorphological examination of the respiratory organs has been conducted in 25 adults and 30 children who died after abdominal surgery. The authors compared the findings of light and immunofluorescent microscopy with laboratory and clinical evidence. Acute respiratory infections revealed in the examinees appeared of different etiology, many of them proved to be mixed. Viral and Mycoplasma infections were most prevalent and severe. Bacterial pneumonias occurred rarely, were clinically inapparent, often arose preoperatively. Weak aspiration indicated the absence of a direct relation between respiratory infections and disorders of bronchial drainage due to surgery performed.
