Anthelmintic therapy with mebendazole in children with broncho-pulmonary infections (author's transl).

Especially in children a high rate of helminthic infection is to be expected as could be assessed by the present investigation. The easy diagnostic technique can now be combined with a highly effective new treatment, extremely well tolerated and devoid of side effects.
