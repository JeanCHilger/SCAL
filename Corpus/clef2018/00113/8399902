Radiographic changes associated with tracheal isolation of Ureaplasma urealyticum from neonates. Recent studies show an association between the presence of Ureaplasma urealyticum in tracheal aspirates and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We hypothesized that among infants with birth weights < or = 1,250 g and respiratory disease, those with U. urealyticum in their tracheal aspirates would have radiographic evidence of more-severe pulmonary disease more often than would those without this organism. A total of 292 low-birth-weight infants who had endotracheal aspirate cultured within 7 days of birth were enrolled. The radiographic outcome variables were pneumonia, early severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (precocious), and chronic lung disease. Microorganisms were isolated from 128 infants (44%) U. urealyticum was isolated from 44 (15%). Pneumonia was significantly more common in infants with than without U. urealyticum (30% vs. 16%, P = .03). U. urealyticum also was associated with precocious bronchopulmonary dysplasia independent of prematurity, race, and sex (odds ratio, 2.2
