Comparison of empiric aztreonam and aminoglycoside regimens in the treatment of serious gram-negative lower respiratory infections. An open-label, controlled, randomized study was performed to assess the efficacy and safety of combination regimens using either aztreonam or an aminoglycoside control regimen as empiric therapy for suspected aerobic gram-negative bacillary pneumonia or purulent bronchitis. Eighty-four patients, 42 in each arm of the study, were randomly assigned to one of two treatment regimens. The combination aztreonam regimen included aztreonam, 2 gm every 8 hours (q8h), plus either clindamycin, 600 to 900 mg q8h, or nafcillin, 1.5 gm to 2 gm every 6 hours (q6h). The control regimen was one of the following depending on the combination therapy that was designated standard at each of the three study institutions: amikacin, 5 mg/kg q8h, plus cefazolin, 1 gm q8h amikacin, 500 mg every 12 hours plus mezlocillin, 4 gm q6h
