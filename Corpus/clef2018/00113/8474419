Chlamydia in the neonate. Chlamydia trachomatis infections are the most prevalent of all sexually transmitted diseases and can be transmitted to the neonate during the birth process. Neonatal chlamydial infections include inclusion conjunctivitis and chlamydial pneumonia. These infections cause no reported mortality but are associated with a high incidence of morbidity in the newborn. Nursing care is vitally important in prevention, early detection, and management of neonates with chlamydial infections. A knowledge of Chlamydia, its risk factors, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment will assure an improved outcome for the entire neonatal population.
