Aspergillus infection in the Western Cape. The inhalation of spores of Aspergillus may result in allergic, infective or saprophytic clinical reactions, depending on the immunological status of the host. Five cases of bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in asthmatics, 62 asthmatics with evidence of skin hypersensitivity to Aspergillus, but without bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, 3 patients with Aspergillus pneumonia and 7 with aspergillomas diagnosed in the Western Cape during the last 18 months, are described. The characteristic features of each type of reaction to Aspergillus are reviewed. The importance of bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and the permanent damage it can produce when it goes unrecognized and untreated, are emphasized. It is hoped that this report will increase local awareness of this complication in asthmatics and thus favour early diagnosis and treatment.
