Chlamydia pneumoniae infection in patients with pneumonia, bronchitis and acute upper respiratory tract infection in Beijing. A prospective study for C. pneumoniae infection was conducted in 134 patients with acute respiratory disease and 134 matched patients with other medical reasons from January to May 1994 in Beijing. The positive rate of micro-IF (MIF) IgG antibodies was 93% (125/134) and 89% (119/134) respectively (0.1 < P < 0.25) and the geometric mean titers (GMT) were not found to be significant (55.9 +/- 4.2 vs 41.7 +/- 2.8, 0.1 < P < 0.20). Ten patients, four (4/30) with pneumonia and six (6/81) with bronchitis were serologically diagnosed as having recent C. pneumoniae infection. Chronic bronchitis was statistically more frequent in patients with C. pneumoniae infection than those without (0.025 < P < 0.05). Patients with chronic bronchitis (GMT, 87.1 +/- 3.9 n = 36) tended to have higher IgG titers than those without (GMT, 47.6 +/- 4.1
