Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection and arthritis in man. Seven patients developed arthritis after Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. Their joint symptoms persisted for up to one year. One patient developed an articular erosion and in another rheumatoid factor was present in serum transiently. Mycoplasma infection often causes ill-defined arthralgias and myalgias, but the migratory polyarthropathy of middle-sized joints that occurred in these patients is much less common. The prognosis seems to be good.
