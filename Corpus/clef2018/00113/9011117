Effect of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor on combination therapy with aztreonam and clindamycin for infections in neutropenic patients with hematologic diseases. The present multicenter study was performed to evaluate the effect of recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) on combination therapy using aztreonam (AZT) and clindamycin (CLDM) to treat severe infection in neutropenic patients with hematologic diseases. Forty-three neutropenic patients with infections (rhG-CSF group) were treated with AZT (2 g) and CLDM (600 mg) 2-3 times daily as well as rhG-CSF (Lenograstim or Filgrastim: 2-5 mu/kg/day). The clinical efficacy of this regimen was compared to that obtained in 44 febrile neutropenic patients, with hematologic diseases, who received only AZT and CLDM in a previous study (historical control group). The overall efficacy rate was 69.8% (30/43) in the rhG-CSF group and 65.9% (29/44) in the historical control group. Although the neutrophil count was significantly increased and C-reactive protein tended to be lower in the rhG-CSF group, the daily maximum body temperature profiles of the 2 groups were nearly the same. These results suggest that rhG-CSF is of little benefit in the treatment of single infectious episodes in neutropenic patients, and that appropriate antibiotic therapy is more important.
