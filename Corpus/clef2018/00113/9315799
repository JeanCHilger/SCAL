The impact of nosocomial infections on patient outcomes following cardiac surgery. To evaluate the relationship between nosocomial infections and clinical outcomes following cardiac surgery, and to identify risk factors for the development of nosocomial infections in this patient population.Prospective cohort study.Barnes-Jewish Hospital, St. Louis, a university-affiliated teaching hospital.Six hundred five consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery.Prospective patient surveillance and data collection.Occurrence of nosocomial infections, multiorgan dysfunction, hospital mortality, and risk factors for the acquisition of nosocomial infections.One hundred thirty-one (21.7%) patients acquired at least one nosocomial infection following cardiac surgery. Four independent risk factors for the development of a nosocomial infection were identified: the duration of mechanical ventilation, postoperative empiric antibiotic administration, the duration of urinary tract catheterization, and female gender. Thirty (5.0%) patients died during their hospitalization. The mortality rate of patients acquiring a nosocomial infection (11.5%) was significantly greater than the mortality rate of patients without a nosocomial infection (3.2%) (odds ratio [OR]=4.0 95% confidence interval [CI]=2.7 to 5.8Nosocomial infections, which are common following cardiac surgery, are associated with prolonged lengths of hospitalization, the development of multiorgan dysfunction, and increased hospital mortality. These data suggest potential interventions for the prevention of nosocomial infections following cardiac surgery that could substantially improve patient outcomes and decrease medical care costs.
