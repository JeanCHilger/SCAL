Cystic fibrosis in an elderly woman. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is thought of by most physicians as a disease of children. Advances in therapy have extended the life span of patients so that many pulmonary internists have responsibility for the care of young adults with CF. Nevertheless, the initial diagnosis of CF after the age of 30 years is unusual, and a diagnosis after the age of 60 years is rare. Such a case is reported here.
