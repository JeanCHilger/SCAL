Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of nosocomial Staphylococcus aureus isolates from trauma patients. Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of nosocomial infections. During the period from March 1992 to March 1994, the patients admitted to the intensive care unit of the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center were monitored for the development of S. aureus infections. Among the 776 patients eligible for the study, 60 (7.7%) patients developed 65 incidents of nosocomial S. aureus infections. Of the clinical isolates, 43.1% possessed a polysaccharide type 5 capsule, 44.6% possessed a type 8 capsule, and the remaining 12.3% had capsules that were not typed by the type 5 or type 8 antibodies. Six antibiogram types were noted among the infection-related isolates, with the majority of the types being resistant only to penicillin and ampicillin. It was noted that the majority of cases of pneumonia were caused by relatively susceptible strains, while resistant strains were isolated from patients with bacteremia and other infections. Only 16 (6.3%) of the isolates were found to be methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). DNA fingerprinting by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed 36 different patterns, with characteristic patterns being found for MRSA strains and the strains with different capsular types. Clonal relationships were established, and the origins of the infection-related isolates in each patient were determined. We conclude that (i) nosocomial infection-related isolates from the shock trauma patients did not belong to a single clone, although the predominance of a methicillin-resistant genotype was noted, (ii) most infection-related S. aureus isolates were relatively susceptible to antibiotics, but a MRSA strain was endemic, and (iii) for practical purposes, the combination of the results of capsular and antibiogram typing can be used as a useful epidemiological marker.
