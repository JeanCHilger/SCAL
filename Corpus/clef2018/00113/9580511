Clinical and epidemiological spectrum of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections at a pediatric hospital. The objective of this study was to determine the epidemiology of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections at our hospital and to evaluate the prescription of macrolides to empirically treat respiratory infections in children.A one year prospective study was performed. To find out the prevalence of M. pneumoniae infections, we obtained blood samples of 519 children attending our hospital out-patient department to determine M. pneumoniae IgG levels. In order to establish the incidence, IgM antibodies against M. pneumoniae were measured in 255 children admitted to the hospital showing clinical pictures compatible with this infection.In the first years of life, prevalence of M. pneumoniae infection was low. According to our study, only 3.3% of 1 year-old patients had M. pneumoniae antibodies. Antibody levels increased in children of 5 years or older. The highest rates, between 58.5% and 63.3%, were detected in patients between 8 and 12 years of age. The incidence rate (6.7%) was low among the children admitted. The most frequent clinical entity was pneumonia (82%). The highest rate of infection was found in children of 8 to 10 years. Symtomatology was mainly sub-acute. Crioagglutinins provided the most significant predictive value for etiological diagnosis.M. pneumoniae infections gain significance in patients over 5 years of age. In our environment, incidence of acute symptomatic infection is low. We consider that both age and presentation of acute respiratory processes should be taken into account when establishing empirical macrolide treatment in children.
