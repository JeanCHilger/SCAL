A randomized clinical study of sulperazone versus tienam in the treatment of LRTIS. The purpose of the clinical study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Sulperazone (SPZ) (sulbactam/cefoperazone) comparited with tienam in the treatment of lower resperiatory tract infections. A total of 73 patients enrolled in the study. 61 patients were evaluated for efficacy (SPZ 31, TIM 30) and 63 patients were evaluated for safty (SPZ 31, TIM 32). Drugs were administered twice a day for 7-14 days, at a daily dose of either 2.0-4.0 g of sulperazone or 2.0-4.0 g tienam. The overall clinical efficacy rates of sulperazone and tienam were 93.5% and 93.3%, respectively. Total pathogens were isolated from 49 of 61 patients prior to treatment. Over two-thirds of the isolates (37/48, 77.1%) were beta-lactammase producing strains. The bacterialogical clearance rate was 92.0% and 91.7% for both groups. The incidence of adverse drug reactions for SPZ and TIM were 3.2% and 10.0%, respectively. The susceptibility rates of the bacteria isolated to five drugs: sulperazone, tienam, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime were 95.9%, 93.9%, 96.0%, 70.0%, and 80.0% respectively. The susceptibility rate of sulperazoene was significant.
