Measles and its complications in Hamburg from 1960 to 1973 (author's transl). A study of measles was undertaken from the case histories of 3 093 children under 15 years of age, treated in the children's clinics of Hamburg between 1960 to 1973. 562 children were suffering from pneumonia (18,2%), 230 had otitis (7,4%) and 229 (7,4%) showed neural affections (143 cases with fits and 86 patients with encephalopathy or encephalitis), Various parameters were analysed: age, sex, seasonal distribution, fatality, age disposition to convulsions and measles encephalitis, "incubation period" of neural affections, sequelae. Permanent sequelae due to measles encephalitis were seen in 14% of the cases. A plea is made for an universal immunisation against measles.
