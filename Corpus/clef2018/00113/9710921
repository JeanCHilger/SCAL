Effects of a selenium/vitamin E substitution on the development of newborn calves on selenium-deficient farms. The present study was carried out in order to examine the efficiency of selenium/vitamin E on the health status in the first eight weeks of life in Se-deficient neonate calves. The experiments were done with 54 calves from two farms. Animals with low selenium level p.n. (< 40 micrograms/l) were randomly classified alternatively to be treated (gr. I) or to serve as control (gr. II). The calves of group I were treated with 0.2 mg selenium and 60 mg vitamin E per kg body weight subcutaneously on the first and third day p.n. they got another treatment with half of the dosage in the fourth week of life. Group II received a placebo (0.9% sterile NaCl-solution). Clinical and haematological examination brought following results: Group I showed a lower infection rate and the duration of infection (especially in the case of pneumonia) was shorter than in the controls. During two days, after initial selenium substitution, the GSH-Px-activity was clearly higher in the animals of group I. The amount of antibiotics and special diets per calf was lower in group I. In conclusion it can be said, that the application of selenium and vitamin E seemed to improve the status of health in the Se-deficient calves, although the results could not be assured statistically.
