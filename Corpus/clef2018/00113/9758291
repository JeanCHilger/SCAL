Trovafloxacin versus high-dose amoxicillin (1 g three times daily) in the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. Once-daily trovafloxacin 200 mg was compared with high-dose amoxicillin, 1 g three times daily, given for 7 to 10 days. At end of treatment (day 10), the response was clinically successful (cure + improvement) in 93% of 152 clinically evaluable trovafloxacin patients and in 89% of 160 amoxicillin patients. At study end (day 35), respective rates were 91% and 81% (95% confidence interval: 1.6, 17.6 P=0.01). In evaluable patients with positive baseline radiographs, 93% of trovafloxacin and 88% of amoxicillin patients demonstrated radiological resolution at end of treatment. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae eradication rates were comparable at end of treatment in both treatment groups, but at study end Streptococcus pneumoniae eradication rates were higher in trovafloxacin patients (100% vs 81%). At study end, all four trovafloxacin patients with baseline penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae were clinically cured with pathogen eradication, whereas two of five amoxicillin patients with baseline penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae were clinical failures with pathogen persistence. For patients in whom no pathogen was identified, trovafloxacin was significantly more effective at end of treatment (P=0.096) and study end (P=0.013). Treatment-related adverse events were comparable
