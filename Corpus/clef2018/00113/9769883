Interest of gene amplification by PCR for the diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections in the child. Between december 1996 and february 1998, rhinopharyngeal and tracheal aspirates from 165 children exhibiting symptoms compatible with M. pneumoniae infection were tested by a PCR method using in the same tube primers specific for M. pneumoniae P1 adhesin gene and for a human control gene. The positive cases were controlled using culture and/or serology. PCR was positive in 22 out of 165 samples (13.3%) an evaluation of the clinical and biological data was possible in 20 of these infected children. From 17 PCR positive respiratory samples tested by culture, 13 (76.5%) grew M. pneumoniae. From 14 serum specimens tested by ELISA, 12 exhibited specific IgM (3 of them with low titers)
