Evaluation of Meridian ImmunoCard Mycoplasma test for the detection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae-specific IgM in paediatric patients. The Meridian ImmunoCard Mycoplasma kit, a 10-min card-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) designed to detect immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to Mycoplasma pneumoniae was evaluated. We compared the ImmunoCard with the Fujirebio Serodia Myco II particle agglutination test, as well as with the complement fixation (CF) test to detect M. pneumoniae antibodies in paediatric patients. The ImmunoCard test and Serodia Myco II test agreed in 93.95%, and ImmunoCard test and CF test agreed in 83.51% of the 182 specimens tested. Nine specimens gave negative particle agglutination titres in the acute phase sample, and 28 specimens gave negative CF titres in the acute phase sample, although in the ImmunoCard test they were positive. These results may indicate that the ImmunoCard assay detects lower IgM levels of antibodies than the Serodia Myco II and CF test. The ImmunoCard appears to be a good screening assay test for M. pneumoniae IgM in children in whom M. pneumoniae IgM is found frequently.
