A double fistulous communication between the aortic root and both left cardiac chambers. Its diagnosis by multiplanar transesophageal echocardiography. The case of a patient with mitral and aortic mechanical valve prostheses is presented who developed early postoperative infective endocarditis and, subsequently, a fistulous communication between the posterior aortic sinus and both the left atrium and the left ventricle. A diastolic murmur of apparent aortic prosthesis regurgitation was heard, although an abnormal aortic valve function could not be demonstrated in the transthoracic echocardiographic study. Instead, the presence of a systolic high velocity flow by continuous wave Doppler suggested prosthetic mitral leakage. The clinical presentation of progressive congestive heart failure and pulmonary hypertension by Doppler prompted a further study by means of transesophageal echocardiography with multiplanar probe showing the above mentioned double fistulous communication. The diagnosis was later confirmed by angiography and also at surgery.
