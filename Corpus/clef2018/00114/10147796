Transesophageal color Doppler flow imaging in the evaluation of prosthetic cardiac valves. To determine the value of transesophageal echocardiography in the assessment of prosthetic cardiac valves, 11 patients with clinically suspected cardiac prosthetic valve dysfunction were studied by transesophageal two-dimensional imaging, as well as by color Doppler flow mapping.  Among these 11 patients, there were 10 with biological tissue valves and 3 with metallic valves (1 Bjork-Shiley, 2 St. Jude). Nine patients had replacement of mitral valves alone.  The remaining two had received both mitral and aortic prostheses.  The degree of mitral regurgitation was graded by transesophageal color Doppler according to the area of the regurgitant jet visualized.  The degree of aortic regurgitation was graded by the jet height/left ventricular outflow height ratio method.  All transesophageal studies were performed without complication and all were well tolerated.  The pathological morphology of the cardiac prosthesis was clearly visualized by transesophageal two-dimensional imaging and subsequently proven at surgery.  Of those tested, one patient was found to have a torn leaflet, one had a dislodged leaflet, one patient had paravalvular leakage, four had cusp vegetations, and five patients had prosthetic degeneration for other reasons. Mitral regurgitation was graded as absent in one patient, mild in two patients, moderate in two patients, and severe in six patients. Aortic regurgitation was graded as severe in both patients with aortic prostheses.  We conclude that in patients with clinically suspected cardiac prosthetic dysfunction, transesophageal two-dimensional imaging combined with color Doppler can provide reliable information that corresponds to surgical findings.
