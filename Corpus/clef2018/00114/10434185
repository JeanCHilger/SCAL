Endovascular Doppler guide wire in renal arteries. Correlation with angiography in 20 patients. To evaluate the feasibility of endovascular Doppler recording in renal arteries and to compare the reliability of Doppler parameters for detection of renal artery stenosis.The authors examined 36 renal arteries in 20 patients with a 0.018" endovascular flow wire. Peak systolic velocity and the renal artery-to-aortic peak were measured in the main renal artery. From intrarenal waveforms, acceleration, acceleration time, and the renal resistive index were obtained. Spectral analysis with consensus scoring of early systolic peak was also performed.Twelve significantly stenosed renal arteries and 26 normal renal arteries were examined with the Doppler guide wire, without complications. Peak systolic velocity was the only parameter significantly different in renal artery stenosis (P = 0.037). Peak systolic velocity also differed significantly between hypertensive and normotensive patients. Tardus parvus was specific for severe renal artery stenosis.Endovascular Doppler is a safe and accurate method for the determination of velocity measurements and may be useful during percutaneous renal artery revascularization.
