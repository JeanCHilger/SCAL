Surgical repair in ruptured congenital sinus of Valsalva aneurysms: a 13-year experience. Rupture of congenital sinus of Valsalva aneurysm is a rare cardiac malformation that usually causes reduced cardiac performance.Twenty patients (mean age 28.3 +/- 10.7 years range: 14 to 55 years) with rupture of congenital sinus of Valsalva aneurysm were operated on at our institution between January 1985 and March 1999. The origin of the ruptured aneurysms was the right coronary sinus in 18 patients (90%) and the non-coronary sinus in two (10%). No ruptures were observed originating from the left coronary sinus. The aneurysms ruptured into the right ventricle in 14 patients (70%), into the right atrium in five (25%), and into the left ventricle in one patient (5%). Subarterial ventricular septal defect (VSD) was the most common associated defect (30%), and aortic insufficiency the second (20%). No correlation was found between subarterial VSDs and aortic insufficiency (p > 0.05). To achieve repair, the aorta and cavity into which the aneurysm had ruptured were opened. The aneurysmal sac was excised and the defect closed with a patch in 18 patients, and without patch in two.One patient died in hospital (mortality rate 5%) no late mortality was observed. Surviving patients were followed up for 4.4 +/- 3.3 years (range: 1 to 13 years). The actuarial survival rate was 95% at 12.35 years. Recurrence of fistula was observed in one patient (5%) in whom the ruptured aneurysm had been closed by primary suture without the use of a patch. At 12.35 years, the actuarial freedom from recurrence of fistula was 94.74% for all survivors, and 100% for patients with patch closure. No late complications have been observed.Following diagnosis of ruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm, surgical repair is the treatment of choice. Surgery performed as rapidly as possible after diagnosis in general leads to an excellent outcome.
