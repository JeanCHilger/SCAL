Fate of endoleaks after endoluminal repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms with the EVT device. we aim to describe our medium-term follow-up of 20 patients with an endoleak following repair of their abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) using the Endovascular Technologies (EVT) device.the experience of one centre in a prospective multicentre phase II trial.55 patients with an endovascular repair of their AAA and at least 6 months> follow-up were reviewed. Intraoperative angiograms, next day duplex scans and computed tomography (CT) images were used to detect endoleaks. Follow-up with CT and duplex was performed at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. Persistent endoleaks at 6 months were evaluated by angiography and treated by endovascular coiling.there were three immediate conversions to open procedures. Twenty of 52 (38%) patients had an endoleak identified initially. One patient died from a myocardial infarction and three were not evident any longer by discharge CT. Sixteen endoleaks (31%) were present at discharge. Nine resolved spontaneously by 3-6 months and seven were still persistent at 6 months (14%). Six patients underwent coiling of their leak, all with successful radiographic seal after 1-3 sessions.endoleaks are frequent after endovascular AAA repair, but the majority close spontaneously. Coiling of the leaks and radiographic seal can be achieved in all cases still persistent at 6 months. Whether this method is clinically effective awaits further follow-up.
