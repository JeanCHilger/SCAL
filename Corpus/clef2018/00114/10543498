Application of AdvaSeal for acute aortic dissection: experimental study. In the surgical treatment of acute aortic dissection, intractable hemorrhage often occurs. We performed an animal study to test the hypothesis that a new sealant, AdvaSeal (Ethicon Inc, Johnson & Johnson Medical KK, Somerville, NJ), can close the false channel of aortic dissection.Acute descending aortic dissection was created surgically in 12 mongrel dogs. In 7 of these (treated group), AdvaSeal was applied to the false cavity for reinforcing and fusing the dissected layers and also to the suture line. The other 5 dogs (control) were left untreated. Specimens were harvested 2 weeks after surgery.The sealant could be used in wet conditions. In the treated group, hemostasis was easily achieved during surgery. All false cavities were perfectly thrombosed, causing no deleterious effects related to the sealant. In the control group, all false lumina remained patent.The advantage of AdvaSeal was its effectiveness on wet tissue and its adhesiveness, allowing good hemostasis and closure of the false lumen. The sealant can be an easy and efficacious sealant in treatment for acute aortic dissection.
