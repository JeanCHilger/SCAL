Expanded indications for ultrasound-guided thrombin injection of pseudoaneurysms. We previously reported preliminary data on a new procedure that we developed for the treatment of femoral pseudoaneurysms after catheterization. This study presents our current results of percutaneous ultrasound-guided thrombin injection for treating pseudoaneurysms that arise from various locations and causes.Between February 1996 and May 1999, we performed thrombin injection of 83 pseudoaneurysms in 82 patients. There were 74 femoral pseudoaneurysms: 60 from cardiac catheterization (36 interventional), seven from peripheral arteriography (four interventional), five from intra-aortic balloon pumps, and two from dialysis catheters. There were nine other pseudoaneurysms: five brachial (two cardiac catheterization, two gunshot wounds, one after removal of an infected arteriovenous graft), one subclavian (central venous catheter insertion), one radial (arterial line), and one distal superficial femoral and one posterior tibial (both after blunt trauma). Twenty-nine pseudo-aneurysms were injected while on therapeutic anticoagulation. Patients underwent repeat ultrasound examination within 5 days and after 4 weeks.Eighty-two of 83 pseudoaneurysms had initial successful treatment by this technique, including 28 of 29 in patients who were undergoing anticoagulation therapy. The only complication was thrombosis of a distal brachial artery, which resolved spontaneously. There were early recurrences in seven patients: four patients underwent successful reinjection reinjection failed in two patients, who underwent surgical repairUltrasound-guided thrombin injection of pseudoaneurysms has excellent results, which support its widespread use as the primary treatment for this common problem.
