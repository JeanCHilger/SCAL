3D MR angiography of the entire aorta: modified application of the body-phased array coil for a single-shot technique. Evaluation of different contrast-enhanced MR angiography imaging protocols for visualization of the entire aorta in breath-hold technique.Three different CE (0.15 mmol/kg) MRA protocols were evaluated by phantom and patient studies: (1) two separate MRA with conventional application of the body-phased array coil (2) a single-shot MRA with modified application of the body-phased array coilIn all examinations the entire aorta could be visualized. The best SNR was acquired with protocol (1). The SNR of protocol (2) was reduced if the sagittal body diameter of the patient was greater than 20 cm and decreased significantly with diameters over 30 cm. By the use of protocol (3) the SNR was notably poor. The quality scored for the visualization of the entire aorta was 97.5% (protocol 1) 92.5% (protocol 2)In most cases the modified application of the body-phased array coil allows the imaging of the entire aorta as a single-shot 3D CE MRA in diagnostic quality.
