Surgical treatment of Takayasu's arteritis: case report and literature review. Surgical intervention during the early stages of Takayasu's arteritis is rarely necessary. In the chronic stages of this disease, however, surgeons may be faced with difficult decisions regarding the timing of complex arterial reconstructions. These issues can be especially challenging in the pediatric population. We report the case of an 8-year-old girl with chronic Takayasu's arteritis complicated by malignant hypertension. Despite aggressive medical therapy, her blood pressure remained uncontrolled. Imaging studies demonstrated infrarenal aortic and right common iliac artery aneurysms with concomitant segmental stenosis of the right common iliac artery. Since her transplant kidney was based off the right external iliac artery, it was felt that this high-grade stenosis was responsible for her severe hypertension. Immediate surgical reconstruction was therefore recommended. Intraoperatively, the aneurysmal aorta and iliac arteries were found to be densely calcified. The transplant kidney was perfused during aortic clamping by placement of a suprarenal aorta to the right external iliac artery shunt. Endoaneurysmorrhaphy was then performed to reconstruct the aorta after extensive endarterectomy. In the early postoperative period, antihypertensive medications were decreased to two oral agents. She was discharged on the seventh postoperative day and placed on two agents. At a 1-year follow-up visit, she is on one antihypertensive medication. Her right leg complaints have resolved. Ultrasound surveillance revealed no evidence of recurrent aneurysmal or occlusive disease. A brief review of complications related to Takayasu's arteritis in the children and indications for surgical intervention completes this report.
