Percutaneous revascularization of the renal arteries: predictors of outcome. To identify predictors of clinical outcome after percutaneous revascularization of the renal arteries.In 63 patients, the therapeutic response was retrospectively assessed after percutaneous revascularization of the renal arteries indicated for hypertension (41.3%), renal failure (4.8%), or both (53.9%). All patients underwent percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty, complemented by stent insertion in 30 patients. The authors analyzed the role of clinical and imaging factors, including scintigraphy, Doppler sonography, and angiography for predicting clinical success.In the hypertensive population, there were three cures (5.6%), 26 improvements (48.1%), and 25 failures (46.3%). Among patients with renal insufficiency, 12 were improved (37.5%), 11 were stabilized (34.4%), and nine deteriorated (28.1%). Predictors of favorable outcome for hypertension were shorter duration of hypertension, higher diastolic blood pressure, fibromuscular dysplasia, abnormal Doppler study, higher percentage of angiographic stenosis, and lower grade of aortic atheromatous disease. Predictors of favorable outcome for renal failure were nondiabetic status, abnormal Doppler study, and higher percentage of angiographic stenosis. Abnormal Doppler and scintigraphic examinations predicted successful treatment of hypertension in 60% and 53.8% of cases, respectively, and renal insufficiency in 85% and 60% of cases, respectively.Clinical and angiographic variables were the best predictors of therapeutic success for hypertension. Doppler sonography was useful in patients with renal failure.
