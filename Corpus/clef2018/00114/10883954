Aortic stent-grafting with transrenal fixation: use of newly designed spiral Z-stent endograft. To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a newly designed stent-graft placed across the renal arteries for exclusion of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) with short or tortuous proximal necks.Among a group of AAA patients treated with endovascular grafting, 5 had tortuous proximal necks and 13 had necks <20 mm (mean 13 mm). In these 18 cases, a 2- to 3-cm uncovered segment of the stent-graft was placed transrenally using a catheter inserted into the renal artery as a guide for graft margin positioning. A newly designed stent-graft was constructed from a custom-made spiral Z-stent covered with a thin-walled Dacron material the endografts were deployed through 16-F (aortoaortic model) or 18-F sheaths (bifurcated devices). Renal function was assessed by preoperative and postoperative measurement of urea nitrogen and creatinine. Aneurysm exclusion and renal artery patency were evaluated during follow-up using spiral computed tomography and angiography.The stent-grafts were correctly placed at the intended site in all 18 patients. Renal function was not affected except transiently in 1 patient who developed bilateral renal artery stenoses 24 hours after the procedure Palmaz stents were deployed in each renal artery to reestablish satisfactory blood flow. Of the 33 renal arteries crossed by the bare stent-graft segment, all were patent over a mean 14-month follow-up (range 7-24), including the patient with Palmaz stents implanted for postprocedural renal stenosis. Complete aneurysm exclusion was maintained in 15 (83%) of 18 patientsTransrenal placement of the uncovered leading edge of custom-made spiral Z-stent-based endografts appears feasible and clinically effective in the treatment of AAAs with short or tortuous proximal necks.
