Renal artery stenting following acute aortic dissection: implantation and follow-up. Two patients with renal artery involvement in type B dissection of the aorta were treated by percutaneous stent implantation. Both of them were hypertensive and showed increasing serum creatinine levels. After stent implantation in the renal arteries blood pressure and renal function improved, and the renal arteries were patent in duplex ultrasound 15 and 30 months after treatment respectively.
