Angina abdominalis: duplex ultrasound diagnosis and percutaneous revascularization. Intestinal ischemia is still a challenge for clinicians and requires a close interdisciplinary cooperation between internist, surgeon and radiologist. In the last years the diagnosis and therapy, classically invasive and surgical, was supplemented by duplex ultrasound and percutaneous techniques like angioplasty and stenting. A 56 year-old man from Greece presented with epigastric pain, which was intensified by food ingestion. These symptoms were caused by a stenosis of the superior mesenteric artery, which was diagnosed by duplex sonography and angiography. No blood flow was detected in the inferior mesenteric and the celiac artery. Occlusion of one internal carotid artery made the patient a poor candidate for surgery. Therefore an interventional approach was chosen. A good result was achieved by angioplasty and stent implantation. On the day after the intervention oral food intake was possible without any pain. 18 months after the intervention the patient was free of abdominal symptoms. Therapy of mesenteric ischemia by percutaneous angioplasty and stenting is published only in case-reports and small series. Therefore the indication is mainly restricted to patients with a high risk for a surgical intervention.
