Carotid stenosis and abdominal aortic aneurysm at the follow-up examination in patients treated for acute extremity ischaemia. To evaluate survivors treated for acute extremity ischaemia as a risk-group for carotid stenosis and abdominal aortic aneurysm at the follow-up examination.Clinical study with median follow-up of 14 (8-32) months.Central Hospital of Central Finland.Eighteen survivors with median age of 77 (51-92) years treated for acute extremity ischaemia during two-year period intended to a separate follow-up examination median 14 (8-32) months after the acute episode of vascular occlusion. Ischaemia was considered as acute in 14 patients and acute on chronic in four patients.Thromboembolectomy was the primary intervention excluding two patients with distal upper limb ischaemia who were treated by intravenous heparin.Clinical examination, duplex scanning of carotid bifurcation and sonography of abdominal aorta were performed at the follow-up examination.Significant asymptomatic carotid stenosis >60% was found in four patients (22%), two of these patients had significant bilateral carotid stenosis. One patient (60%) had abdominal aortic aneurysm of 5.2 cm.In survivors treated for acute extremity ischaemia asymptomatic carotid stenosis >60% was found with significantly increased prevalence compared with general population and with equal prevalence when compared with patients with peripheral vascular disease. Occurrence of abdominal aortic aneurysm was parallel with findings in screening surveys.
