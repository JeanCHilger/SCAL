Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms during a basic medical checkup in residents of a Japanese rural community. To determine the prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) and the size distribution of the abdominal aortic diameter in the Japanese population, 1,591 residents of a farming community were screened by ultrasonography during the annual basic medical checkup arranged by the town. The mean diameter of the abdominal aorta was 17.2 +/- 2.2mm and four AAAs were found (0.3%), all in men aged 60 years or older, three of whom were hypertensive. The mean diameter of the common iliac artery was 10.2 +/- 5.1mm and five iliac arterial aneurysms were found (0.3%). One man had both aortic and iliac arterial aneurysms. The iliac arterial aneurysms were also found in men, four of whom were aged 60 years or older and had a smoking habit. We were able to keep the cost of screening low by combining the program with an annual basic medical checkup. These findings indicate that it is important to examine the iliac artery as well as the abdominal aorta because the incidence of aneurysm is similar in both. Screening for AAAs using ultrasonography is accurate enough to detect them before rupture, and can be effectively performed in men aged 60 years or older during their annual basic medical checkup.
