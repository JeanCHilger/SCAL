Videoendoscopic thoracic aorta-to-femoral artery bypass in the pig. The thoracoscopic approach to the aorta has the advantages of easy aortic dissection, excellent inflow, improved exposure in the thorax without insufflation, and ability to employ both laparoscopic and traditional instruments. Our aim was to develop a thoracoscopic technique for descending thoracic aorta-to-femoral artery bypass (TAFB) in the pig that results in acceptable short-term survival and graft patency.Thoracoscopic TAFB was performed in 11 pigs. Using two-lung ventilation, the animals were placed in a 45 degrees left lateral semidecubitus position. A fan lung retractor, two dissecting ports, intercostal artery loops, and camera were placed through five 10- to 20-mm thoracoscopic incisions. After aortic dissection, an 8-mm graft was passed through a retroperitoneal tunnel. Rumel tourniquets were used for aortic occlusion after placement of a shunt. End-to-side endoscopic anastomosis was completed with knots tied extracorporeally. The left femoral anastomosis was completed under direct vision. Duplex ultrasound of the graft was done on postoperative days 1, 3, and 7.Thoracoscopic TAFB was completed in all animals. Mean aortic anastomosis time was 57 min (range, 34-145) and mean cross-clamp time, 74 min (range, 53-155). Mean operative time was 310 minVideoendoscopic TAFB can be completed in pigs with acceptable short-term patency and survival. Further experience in thoracoscopic techniques can make TAFB a feasible and low-risk option for selected patients with aortoiliac occlusive disease.
