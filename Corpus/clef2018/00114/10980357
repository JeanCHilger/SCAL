Takayasu arteritis. Treatment and prognosis in a university center in Brazil. The aim of this study was to evaluate the treatment and evolution of TA patients in a University Center in Brazil. This is a retrospective and descriptive study, that included all patients with TAs who attended the out-patient clinic at the Universidade Federal de Sao Palo, between 1993 and 1998. Twenty-four patients were women and 22 where white. The median age at the time of diagnosis was 27 yo. Full arteriography was performed in 28 patients and carotid duplex ultrasound plus computed tomography of aorta was done in two patients. Type I was found in 4, type II-a and type II in one case each, the type IV in 4 cases and the type V in 20 patients. Regarding the treatment only three patients with quiescent disease did not receive any medications. Twenty-seven patients (90%) received prednisone and only ten of these patients achieved disease control. Forth-eight percent of patients who received prednisone showed some side effects. Twelve patients received methotrexate associated to prednisone and 58% of them had a good response. Two patients who did not control disease activity with prednisone plus methotrexate received cyclophosphamide without good results. Some surgical procedure was performed in ten TA patients. Three patients died during the follow-up. This study showed that the majority of TA patients attended at a University Center needed association of prednisone and methotrexate to control disease activity, 30% needed some surgical procedures and that may be a cause of death in a young patient.
