Role of laparoscopy in the staging of malignant disease. Although diagnostic laparoscopy has been used by surgeons and gastroenterologists since the early 1900s, today's surgical oncologists have been relatively slow to embrace this technology. Together with the fervor and benefits afforded by laparoscopic therapeutic interventions in the management of patients with benign disease and the diagnostic usefulness in blunt trauma and abdominal pain, awareness has been rekindled regarding the advantages of laparoscopy for the staging of abdominal malignancy. As surgeons begin to realize that extirpative procedures are doomed to failure in curing patients with diffuse abdominal metastases disclosed on laparoscopic assessment, palliative measures, such as stent placement, ablative procedures, balloon dilatation, intraluminal high-dose radiation, and laser techniques will be used commonly by surgical endoscopists and gastroenterologists. Similarly, it is hoped that the use of systemic chemotherapy will achieve better specificity in cell destruction in patients identified laparoscopically to have uncontained disease in the abdominal cavity. The sensitivity of sonography combined with laparoscopy has been shown to approach that of celiotomy in the evaluation of solid organs, thereby avoiding unnecessary laparotomy and its associated morbidities. Using sonography as a complement to laparoscopy will extend the usefulness of both techniques. The application of laparoscopy and the advent of miniaturized laparoscopic instrumentation (Fig. 7), both diagnostic and therapeutic, in the management of patients with abdominal malignancy will be limited only by the creativity and expertise of physicians and instrument makers.
