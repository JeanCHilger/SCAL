Clinical evaluation of ATS prosthetic valve by doppler echocardiography: comparison with St. Jude Medical (SJM) valve. ATS valve is a bileaflet valve developed to have a superior function to traditional prosthetic valves on anti-thrombogenesis and hemolysis. The orifice area was enlarged in consequence of making its orifice with pyrolytic carbon materials, and the pivot was open pivot and the strut was eliminated. The efficiency of this valve has been reported in the Europe. In Japan, its clinical trial was performed in September 1993 and its clinical use was permitted in August 1996. In this study, we compared the functions of ATS and St. Jude Medical (SJM) valves with echocardiography. The pressure gradients at the mitral valve position were not significantly different between ATS and SJM valves, but that of ATS was lower than that of SJM. The pressure gradient at the aortic valve position of ATS was also lower than that of SJM, and especially those of the patients who performed aortic valve replacement with 23-mm ATS and SJM valves were 8.9+/-1.6 and 23.3+/-6.6 mmHg, showing a significant difference. Though further observation and review of this valve are needed at the chronic phase, ATS valve is an excellent bileaflet valve on the valvular function, showing a low pressure gradient.
