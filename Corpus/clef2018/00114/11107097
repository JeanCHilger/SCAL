Endovascular repair of aortic allograft aneurysmal degeneration: a case report. Aortoenteric graft fistula remains a dreadful complication of aortic surgery. Good results have been reported using in situ graft replacement with arterial allografts. Late aneurysmal degeneration of the graft itself may necessitate further repair. We report the case of such an aneurysmal degeneration 7 years after implantation of the allograft. Endovascular repair was performed with a Vanguard device complete exclusion was obtained immediately. At 6-month follow-up, the patient was alive and well. Duplex and computed tomography scans showed an excluded aneurysm with a slight reduction in size. Endovascular stent grafting may be a therapeutic option for treating patients with late allograft degeneration.
