Clinical utility of routine screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm during echocardiography. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical utility of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) as a screening method for the detection of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA).Each patient who was referred to the echocardiography laboratory TTE was included into the study. After complete cardiac assessment the abdominal aorta was evaluated. Patients with a known, a clinically suspected, or a previously operated AAA were excluded.During the study period, 14,876 patients underwent TTE. 13,166 (88.5%) of the patients were 50 years and older. Of these 6953 (52.8%) were men and 6213 (47.2%) were women. A total of 108 (0.82% 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67-0.99) clinically unsuspected AAA of at least 3 cm in diameter (range 3 cm-6.8 cm) were detected. There were 93 (86.1%) men and 15 (13.9%) women with a mean age of 73.8 years (range 59-90). In 7 patients an AAA was suspected by TTE but not verified on subsequent abdominal ultrasound, as the diameter of the abdominal aorta was less than 3 cm. The prevalence of an AAA in patients 50 years and older was 1.34% (95% CI 1.08-1.64) for men and 0.24% (95% CI 0.14-0.40) for women. In patients less than 50 years old no aneurysm was detected. Seventeen patients who were found to have an AAA with a mean diameter of 4.4 cm (range 3-6 cm) underwent successful elective conventional AAA repair after a mean interval of 13.9 months (range 0.2-49 months) following the initial diagnosis.TTE performed in a highly selected cardiac patient group in a tertiary referral center is not a useful tool to screen for clinically unsuspected abdominal aortic aneurysms due to the low prevalence. The detection of an aneurysm should be confirmed by conventional abdominal ultrasound.
