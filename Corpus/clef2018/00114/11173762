Supra-aortic arteries angioplasty and stenting: an ultrasonographic follow up. Ultrasonographic follow up of patients with supra-aortic arteries angioplasty and stenting was performed to determine the normal characteristics and to detect restenosis or thrombosis at the repair site.Twenty-eight patients were followed. The delay between the procedure and the ultrasonographic examination was 1 to 5 years. There were 32 procedures: 7 carotid angioplasties with stenting 32 vertebral angioplasties (2 stentings), 2 brachiocephalic artery angioplasties (1 stenting)All of the carotid stents were patent. No restenosis appeared during the follow up. A parietal thickening was observed in one patient without significant reduction of the arterial lumen. There were one vertebral and one brachiocephalic stent thrombosis. The results of the ultrasonographic examinations correlated well with magnetic resonance imaging.The ultrasonographic follow up of supra aortic arteries angioplasty and stenting is feasible. An early examination is recommended after the vascular procedure to control the efficacy of the repair and to detect and quantify the residual lesions. This phase is compulsory for an optimal long term follow up.
