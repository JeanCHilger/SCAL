Emergency endovascular treatment of a superior mesenteric artery occlusion. Endovascular treatment of acute mesenteric ischemia is rarely reported. We report a patient with a 1-year history of chronic mesenteric ischemia who presented with acute worsening of his symptoms and peritoneal signs. Aortography depicted an occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery, which was successfully managed with immediate percutaneous angioplasty (PTA) and stent placement. The patient's clinical condition improved markedly and an exploratory laparotomy performed the following day confirmed the viability of the intestine. He remains symptom-free 12 months after the procedure, and color Doppler follow-up showed that the stent is patent.
