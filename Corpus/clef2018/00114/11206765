Influence of transesophageal echocardiography on intraoperative decision making for toronto stentless prosthetic valve implantation. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is commonly used during aortic valve surgery. In aortic valve replacement (AVR), this permits measurement of the aortic annulus, study of the anatomy of aortic valve components, and prediction of prosthesis valve size. After cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), echocardiography is valuable in checking prosthesis function. In this study, we evaluated the impact of intraoperative TEE on the decision-making process of aortic Toronto stentless prosthetic valve (TSPV) implantation.Fifty-two consecutive patients undergoing elective AVR were collected prospectively. Multiplane TEE was performed before CPB to determine diameters of the aortic valve annulus and sinotubular junction. This was to evaluate the feasibility of TSPV implantation in the aortic position and to predict prosthesis size. Further TEE evaluation was carried out after CPB to assess prosthetic valve function.TEE allowed measurement of the aortic annulus and sinotubular junction, and enabled correct prediction of prosthesis size. Ultrasonic evaluation also revealed contraindications to TSPV implantation in five patients. In one case, color-Doppler examination led to immediate successful surgical correction of prosthetic incompetence.Intraoperative multiplane TEE examination is useful in the decision-making process in AVR with the TSPV by selecting patients suitable for the stentless valve, predicting prosthesis size, and checking prosthesis function.
