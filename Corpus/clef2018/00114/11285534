Laparoscopic management of Spigelian hernia. Spigelian hernia (SH) is an uncommon abdominal wall hernia. Its clinical symptoms are not characteristic, and the preoperative diagnosis is often difficult because SH can simulate the symptoms of more classical lower quadrant abdominal diseases. We report a case of SH in an 80-year-old woman that was complicated by incarceration and diagnosed by physical examination and ultrasound. At the time of presentation, she had an abdominal mass that was soft and occasionally painful, and aggravated by movements that increase intraabdominal pressure. Laparoscopic examination of the abdominal cavity identified the incarcerate jejunum ansae. The defect was a large opening in the peritoneum along the lateral margin of the rectus abdominis muscle. After dissection of the intestinal adhesions, a prosthetic polypropylene mesh was introduced and fixed with staples into the lateral abdominal wall. There were no postoperative complications. We conclude that the laparoscopic approach is a feasible alternative to the conventional open technique that is easy, safe, and allows excellent operative visualization.
