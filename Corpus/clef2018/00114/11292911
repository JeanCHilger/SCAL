Endovascular treatment of aortic rupture by blunt chest trauma. The usual treatment of blunt aortic injury (BAI) is prompt surgery. Frequently severe injuries to the brain or lungs exclude further surgical treatment. The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of placing endovascular stent-grafts.From 1992 through 1999, in our primary and referral trauma center, 26 acute BAI, 21 males and 5 females, mean age 40.2+/-16.3 yrs were diagnosed. The last 4 patients underwent prospectively endovascular repair with Talent endograft. Endoprosthesis parameters were measured on three-dimensional spiral CT reconstruction. While waiting for devices, blood pressure was aggressively lowered and aortic lesions were monitored by transesophageal echography.Stent-graft deployment was successful in all 4 patients. There were no complications of endoleak, stent migration, paraplegia or death. Angiographic exclusion was complete in all 4 patients. CT scans at a mean follow-up of 11+/-5 months showed complete healing of the aortic wall in all patients.For stable acute BAI, endovascular stent-graft repair is feasible and safe, and is an effective therapeutic alternative to open surgery. Because of the normal proximal and distal wall in aortic injuries, endoluminal treatment might be the therapy of choice in the near future.
