Five-year results of elastin and collagen markers as predictive tools in the management of small abdominal aortic aneurysms. small abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) do rupture and only half of AAAs above 5 cm would have ruptured unoperated. Furthermore, conservative treatment of AAAs may cause psychological side effects and impaired quality of life. To optimise the indication and time for operation for AAAs, we analysed whether serum elastin peptides (EP), procollagen-IIIN-terminal propeptide (PIIINP), and the initial AAA size could predict operation for AAAs in initially conservatively treated AAA.in 1994, 4404 65-73 year old males were invited to hospital-based screening for AAAs by ultrasonography. Seventy-six percent attended. One hundred and forty-one (4.2%) had AAAs (def: +30 mm). Nineteen were offered operation (AAA +50 mm), and 112 were followed with annual control scans for 1-5 years (mean 2.5 years). Of these, 99 had their EP (ng/ml) and PIIINP (ng/ml) determined using ELISA and RIA techniques. Two observers and one scanner were used.the mean expansion rate was 2.7 mm/year. The initial AAA size (r =0.46 0.26-0.61), EP ( r =0.31a predictive model using EP, PIIINP, and initial AAA size seems capable of predicting nine out of 10 AAAs that will be operated on within 5 years. However, a larger sample size is needed for clinical recommendations.
