PTA and stenting after previous aortoiliac endarterectomy. to evaluate the feasibility and long-term results of angioplasty and stenting in the treatment of restenosis following aortoiliac endarterectomy.between 1991 and 1999 19 patients underwent angioplasty with selective stenting for recurrent stenosis after previous aortoiliac endarterectomy. Aortic lesions were treated five times in four patients. At the iliac level 28 lesions (25 stenosis and three occlusions) were treated in 16 patients (one patient had a stenosis at the aortic as well as iliac level). All patients were followed clinically and by ultrasound. In the second half of 1999, an angiogram or spiral CT-angiography was performed in all patients to determine long-term outcome.technical success was obtained in all patients and clinical success was achieved in 18 of the 19 patients. Angiographic cumulative primary patency for aortoiliac lesions was 96% at 1 year and 76% at 3 years.angioplasty with selective stenting of recurrent aortoiliac disease after previous aortoiliac endarterectomy is feasible and safe. Long-term clinical and angiographic patency rates are in accordance with results of aortoiliac angioplasty in general.
