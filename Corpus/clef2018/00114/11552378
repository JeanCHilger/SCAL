Modern diagnostic concepts in dissection and aortic occlusion. For the diagnostic work-up of the aorta, non-invasive cross-sectional imaging techniques have almost replaced invasive catheter angiography. CT- and MR-angiography are supplemented by sonography which is used predominantly for the assessment of abdominal aortic aneurysm and dissections of the thoracic aorta. This review deals with the diagnostic approach to two disease entities involving the aorta: aortic dissection and aortic occlusion. Transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE), CT- and MR-angiography (MRA) are used in the assessment of aortic dissection. Published sensitivity and specificity values regarding the detection and classification of dissections into Stanford A and Stanford B range between 96-100% for all three modalities. Results for multislice CTA have not yet been reported, but can be expected to be at least as good. The ability to delineate additional information regarding the precise morphology of true and false lumen, entry and reentry-sites, the development of thrombus or paraaortic hematomas, as well as the assessment of aortic regurgitation or involvement of coronary arteries depend on the chosen technique. Reflecting the ability to collect functional imaging data, both TEE and MRA are superior to CTA in the assessment of aortic valve involvement, while TEE is the modality of choice for evaluation of coronary arteries. Sonography is of limited use in the assessment of abdominal dissections. For the evaluation of patients with suspected aortic occlusion both CTA and MRA represent the imaging modalities of choice. Both provide for a comprehensive and precise depiction of the underlying aortic morphology, the extent of collateral flow as well as delineation of distal run-off vessels. MRA should be employed in patients with impaired renal function as paramagnetic contrast agents are not nephrotoxic.
