Pulmonary sequestration. 31 surgically treated cases of pulmonary sequestration are reported. There were 23 of intralobar and 8 of extralobar type, 23 were on the left and 8 on the right. All but three had symptoms most of them pointing to a respiratory tract infection. Six patients had pneumonia, five haemoptyses, three patients pleurisy and two patients empyema before the operation. In addition to chest x-ray, aortogram appeared to be the most valuable tool in providing the accurate diagnosis preoperatively. Most of the cases were treated by lobectomy, in 7 cases by sequestrectomy and in 2 cases by pneumonectomy. One of the patients died from pulmonary infarction due to anomalous ipsilateral pulmonary venous draingae and ligation of the veins by oversight during right lower lobectomy. The rest of the patients recovered uneventfully. On microscopical examination of the specimens a case of aspergillosis was noted, which has not been described previously in the literature in association of pulmonary sequestration. In one case acid-fast bacteria were found in the necrotic mass of the cavities in the sequestration.
