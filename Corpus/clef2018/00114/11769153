Rupture of internal iliac artery aneurysm into the bladder following aortic aneurysm repair. This report describes a case of ruptured internal iliac artery aneurysm into the bladder after repair of an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. Aortic repair consisted of resection of the aneurysm followed by prosthetic interposition to reestablish arterial continuity. During the postoperative period, the patient had ischemia of left colon, which was successfully treated by the Hartmann procedure. A right internal iliac artery aneurysm measuring 50 mm in diameter was demonstrated by an abdominal CT scan during the initial hospitalization but was considered stable, since ultrasonography showed no change in diameter at 3 months and 1 year. The patient was lost from follow-up until 3 years later when he was hospitalized after rupture of the right iliac artery aneurysm, then measuring 120 mm in diameter, into the bladder. Surgical repair was undertaken. The procedure involved aortobifemoral bypass with suture of the bladder defect and branches of the internal iliac artery by the endoaneurysmal route. Postoperative recovery was uneventful. Upon reexamination 1 month after discharge from the hospital, the patient was asymptomatic. This rare case confirms the gravity of internal iliac artery aneurysm and the importance of therapeutic management to prevent rupture.
