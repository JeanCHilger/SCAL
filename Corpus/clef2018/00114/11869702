Ten-year outcome of patients with very small abdominal aortic aneurysm. The long-term fate of very small abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) is not well known.Forty-one patients with asymptomatic small AAA (range 25 to 40 mm) underwent ultrasonographic surveillance.The median follow-up period was 7.3 years. The median linear aneurysm expansion rate was 2.0 mm/year (range 0 to 8.4). Three patients experienced aneurysm rupture (7.3%) which resulted in 1 patient'death. Thirteen patients underwent aneurysm repair (31.7%) and 1 patient died postoperatively (7.7%). The survival rate at 10-year follow-up was 59.0%. The survival rate free from aneurysm rupture and repair at 10-year follow-up was 69.9%. The median time for occurrence of aneurysm rupture was 4.9 years (range 1.8 to 10.5) and the need for aneurysm repair was 4.5 years (range 1.4 to 10.4).The fate of very small AAA is to slowly enlarge in size, sometimes threatening the patient's life. These observations underline the importance of continuous surveillance and the potential benefits of any medical treatment in this patient population.
