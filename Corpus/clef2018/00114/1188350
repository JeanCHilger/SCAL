The value of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm. An evaluation of ultrasonography in early dilatation and aneurysm is presented. Fifty-nine patients with prominent abdominal pulsation were examined and aneurysm was demonstrated in 22. There was a high degree of correlation between the size of the aneurysm demonstrated by ultrasound and the size displayed at operation. It was also possible to demonstrate increasing dilatation by measurement on subsequent occasions.
