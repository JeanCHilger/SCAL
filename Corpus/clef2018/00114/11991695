Duplex follow-up of aorto-iliac stents. to assess the feasibility of duplex follow up of aorto-iliac stents.in addition to standard clinical and ankle/brachial pressure assessment, 75 patients undergoing aorto-iliac stenting for atherosclerotic disease were prospectively followed up with duplex ultrasound at 3 monthly interval up to 1 year and then annually. We attempted to directly visualise the stents wherever possible using standard 2D imaging, standard and power Doppler, as well as spectral Doppler. Patients had an angiogram at 12 months or sooner if a problem was identified on the duplex scan.mean follow up was 14 months (2-36). Complete visualisation of the pelvic arterial tree was achieved in 94% of scans. All patients had at least one satisfactory scan. Duplex detected 30 lesions in 23 patients. Twenty-seven lesions were confirmed at angiography. There were two false positives. Overall sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 100%, 93% and 96% for patient undergoing angiography.duplex ultrasound follow up is feasible in the majority of patients.
