Inflammatory and infectious aortitis. Takayasu's disease is the most characteristic example of aortitis. Non-specific aortoarteritis is the only one with stenotic lesions of the aorta. Ischemic symptoms depend of the arterial lesions. Diagnosis is funded on topographic of arterial involvement. CT scan and ultrasound are the method of choice for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients. Compared to controls, patients with giant cell arteritis are 17 times more likely to develop thoracic aortic aneurysm. The risk of this location could justify a systematic research of an aortic involvement during the follow up of patients with temporal arteritis. Saccular aneurysms are an unusual manifestation of Beh√ßet's disease but as in Horton's disease the poor prognosis impose a systematic evaluation. Syphilitic aortic is actually very rare, staphylococcus and salmonella are the main causes of mycotic aneurysms.
