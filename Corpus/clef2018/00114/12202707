Long-term results 10 years after iliac arterial stent placement. To retrospectively evaluate results in 110 patients who had iliac arterial occlusive disease and were treated with stents before 1991.From 1987 to 1990, 110 patients (mean age, 57 years) with iliac arterial occlusive disease (Fontaine stage IIa, seven patients IIb, 95 patientsThe fate of 109 of the 110 patients was determined. Overall, 46 patients died: 18 within 5 years, 39 within 10 years, and seven after more than 10 years. The 5- and 10-year survival rates were 83% and 64%, respectively. Cardiovascular disease caused 23 deaths malignant tumor caused 15. The cause of death remained unknown in five patients. Primary stent patency rates were 66% +/- 4.8 (standard error) after 5 years and 46% +/- 5.9 after 10 yearsThe main cause of death in patients with intermittent claudication was cardiac disease. Long-term patency of iliac arterial stents was moderate.
