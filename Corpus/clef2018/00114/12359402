Intraoperative transesophageal echo-Doppler evaluation of stentless aortic xenografts. Incidence and significance of moderate gradients. The aim of this study was to assess the utility of intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in the evaluation of patients undergoing aortic valve replacement with the CryoLife-O'Brien (CLOB) Stentless Porcine Aortic Bioprosthesis.Between May 1994 and March 1995, 26 patients (15 men, mean age 68.4+/-10.78 years) had a CLOB valve in the aortic position. Transprosthetic gradients and valve regurgitation were detected by intraoperative TEE. Prosthetic regurgitation and transvalvular gradients were evaluated at six-month intervals using transthoracic echo-Doppler (TTE).The majority of implants resulted in low gradients (83.7%), with only four patients exhibiting a moderate gradient (15.3%). Color flow Doppler imaging showed central aortic regurgitation in only four of 25 patients (trivial, n=4 mild, n=1). There was one paravalvular leak (trivial, n=1). At follow-up examination (mean 37+/-12 months), 24 of 25 patients exhibited low mean gradients (7.25+/-2.81 mmHg). At follow-up one patient who had low velocities in the LVOT at perioperative evaluation exibited a moderate gradient (45 mmHg) with an effective orifice area of 0.8-0.9 cm(2).Intraoperative TEE was effective in assessing prosthetic stentless valve function.
