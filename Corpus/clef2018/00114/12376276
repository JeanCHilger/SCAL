Clinical value of emergency bedside ultrasonocardiogram in cardiac care unit. To evaluate the clinical value of application of emergency bedside ultrasound cardiogram (UCG) in cardiac intensive care unit.We conducted a retrospective analysis of 116 cases who received examination with emergency bedside UCG within the period from April 2000 to March 2001.The positivity rate of examination with emergency bedside UCG was 100% among these patients. The diseases identified were as follows: acute myocardial infarction in 41 cases, angina pectoris in 16, ventricular aneurysm in 5, perforation of ventricular septum in 2, rheumatic valvular disease in 9, dilated cardiomyopathy in 9 and aortic dissecting aneurysm in 7.Emergency bedside UCG has important value in clinical diagnosis of cardiac emergencies.
