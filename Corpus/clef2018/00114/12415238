Aortic dissection with aorto-left atrial fistula formation soon after aortic valve replacement: A lethal complication diagnosed by transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography. Fistulas between the aorta and left atrium are a rare manifestation of aortic dissection and are infrequently diagnosed premortem. We report the case of a 70-year-old man who exhibited this condition soon after aortic valve replacement and eventually died from rapidly developing refractory congestive heart failure. The diagnosis was indicated by transthoracic echocardiography and was ultimately made with transesophageal echocardiography and color flow Doppler imaging. Transesophageal echocardiography is the procedure of choice for establishing the correct diagnosis and leading to prompt surgical repair of this lethal condition.
