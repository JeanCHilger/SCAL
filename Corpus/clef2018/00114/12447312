Endoscopic treatment of cholangiocarcinoma and carcinoma of the duodenal papilla by intraductal high-intensity US: Results of a pilot study. Local and infiltrative extension make some biliary carcinomas accessible to nonoperative intraductal destruction. This study assessed the clinical feasibility and short-term results of local tumor destruction with an intraductal high-intensity US probe during ERCP.The probe is a flexible catheter with an 8 x 2.8 mm US transducer and a lumen for a guidewire. Ten patients (6 women, 4 men mean age 74.8 years) were treated with this device. Lesions treated included carcinoma of the papilla (3), bile duct cholangiocarcinoma (2), Bismuth grade I and II hilar cholangiocarcinomas (4), and intrahepatic cystadenocarcinoma (1). Two patients underwent US therapy before surgery. Treatment was performed during standard ERCP: the probe was inserted through the malignant stricture and US therapy was applied over 360 degrees under fluoroscopic control.No serious adverse effects were observed right upper abdominal pain developed in one patient for 12 hours. In one patient, histopathologic assessment of the resected tumor revealed extensive coagulation necrosis with inflammation up to 10 mm in depth surrounding the bile duct lumen. In the other operated patient, biopsy specimens from the treated portion of the bile duct were negative for malignancy. There was complete regression of cholangiocarcinoma of the bile duct in our patient, allowing for permanent stent removal (follow-up 30 months). A partial response was noted in 4 other patients and no response in 3 patients.This new method of intraductal tumor destruction by high-intensity US during ERCP is feasible and can induce objectively measurable tumor necrosis. Long-term follow-up will determine whether this method is curative in some cases and if it can reduce the need for biliary stent placement.
