Treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Three treatment options are available for an asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA): an expectant approach with ultrasonographic check-ups, reconstruction of the abdominal aorta via the conventional ('open') approach and endovascular repair. For aneurysms less than 5.5 cm in diameter the annual rupture risk is less than 1%. For these patients a better alternative to the expectant approach does not seem to exist. The risk of rupture needs to be weighed up against the risks of a conventional operation. The operation mortality of patients with a non-ruptured AAA is about 7% while other serious complications occur in about 10%. The short to medium-term results of endovascular aneurysm repair are characterized by high reintervention rates, material fatigue and device failure. The three treatment options described are currently being investigated in several large-scale randomised studies for AAAs greater than 5.5 cm in diameter.
