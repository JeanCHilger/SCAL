Initial experience with a multiplane transoesophageal echo-transducer: assessment of diagnostic potential. the prototype of a transoesophageal echocardiographic transducer with a rotatable cross-sectional scanning plane underwent initial evaluation.the 5 MHz, phased array, 64 element transducer is incorporated into a 16 by 11 by 40 mm echoscope tip. The instrument also has pulsed wave and colour flow Doppler capabilities. Exterior controls allow continuous mechanical rotation of the scanning plane from 0 degree, corresponding to the conventional transverse plane, through 180 degrees, thereby encompassing all possible planes.103 patients underwent examination without complications two additional patients were excluded because of difficulty in swallowing the probe. Advantages include precise alignment of aortic valve long- and short-axis views, long-axis views of the ascending aorta (mean visualized length: 6 cm), and full scanning of the entire circumference of the mitral valve and the left ventricle. Separation of paravalvular and transvalvular leakage in prosthetic valves is distinctly improved.multiplanar transoesophageal imaging is feasible and increases the diagnostic yield, especially in mitral and aortic pathology and in the assessment of left ventricular wall motion. Three-dimensional reconstruction is an attractive potential application.
