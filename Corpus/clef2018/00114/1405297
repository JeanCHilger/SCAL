Doppler echocardiography in the assessment of arteriovenous blood ejection in patients with ventricular septal defects. To assess Doppler echocardiography used to determine blood ejection through ventricular septal defect, this procedure and cardiac catheterization were performed in 32 patients. Comparison of the findings showed a high correlation (r = 0.81 p < 0.05). To determine whether echocardiographic accesses are correctly chosen, volumetric greater circulation was measured from the suprasternal access in the ascending aorta and aortic arch, but volumetric lesser circulation was measured from the parasternal access in the pulmonary trunk and from the apical access of the projection of 4 chambers through the mitral orifice. The comparison of the findings showed a high correlation in this group. Twenty one patients were examined after plastic surgery of ventricular septal defect, who had been clinically suspected to have a residual shunting. An analysis of the findings made it possible to develop Doppler echocardiographic criteria for differential diagnosis of graft vibration due to arteriovenous blood ejection.
