Frequency of abdominal aortic aneurysms in adult population with known risk factors. The incidence of abdominal aortic aneurysms has increased. Its predisposing factors are smoking, high blood pressure and dislipidemia. Progressive aneurysmal enlargement may lead to its rupture, which is associated to a mortality rate above 80%.To assess the prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysms in Chilean subjects with cardiovascular risk factors.Through announcements in open media we invited individuals aged over 60 years, who smoked, had hypertension and/or had occlusive arterial disease, to participate in a study that included medical history and physical examination. An aortic ultrasound was performed in all subjects in whom the aorta was not palpable or there was a suspicion of dilatation. Aortic diameter over 3 cm was considered aneurysmal.Three hundred fifty six subjects aged 67.1 +/- 6.7 years, (73.9% males), were evaluated. The study group included 62% hypertensives, 39% with abnormal lipids and 46% smokers. Known coronary heart disease or peripheral arterial diseases were present in 14% and 10%, respectively. Ultrasound was required in 159 subjects. Aneurysms were detected in 21 persons (5.9%), 7.6% in males and 1.1% in females. The mean transverse diameter of the aneurysm was 4.1 cm (3-7.5). Aneurysm was found in 2.3% of subjects younger than 65 years and 8.3% of subjects aged over 65 years.In this sample the prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysms was 5.9%, affecting predominantly males, with a notorious increase with advanced age.
