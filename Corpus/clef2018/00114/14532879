Early and long-term results of conventional surgical treatment of secondary aorto-enteric fistula. To retrospectively evaluate early and late results of surgical treatment of secondary aorto-enteric fistulas (SAEFs) with prosthetic excision and extra-anatomic bypass (conventional treatment) in a single centre institution (teaching hospital).Between January 1990 and March 2002, 30 patients underwent conventional surgical treatment for SAEF. Data concerning these operations were collected in a dedicate database and 30-day mortality, patency and limb salvage rates were evaluated by mean of chi-square test and logistic regression analysis. Clinical and ultrasonographic follow-up was performed late results were evaluated by mean of Kaplan-Meyer curves.Thirty day mortality rate was 26% (8 patients). Timing and sequence of interventions (simultaneous or staged, prosthetic excision or revascularization before) had no significative influence on perioperative mortality. There were six extranatomic bypass thromboses at 30 days, but no amputation. Mean duration of follow-up was 24 months estimated 12- and 24-month survival rates were 60 and 50%, respectively. There were better results in terms of long-term survival in patients undergone prosthetic graft excision before. Primary patency rate was 62% and limb salvage rate was 95%, both at 24 months. Two prosthetic graft reinfections occurred during follow-up (9%). Cumulative reinterventions rate during follow-up was 18%.Conventional surgical treatment of SAEF permitted, in our experience, satisfactory early and long terms results, with fair rates of patency and limb salvage. Surgical timing and sequence do not seem to affect early results.
