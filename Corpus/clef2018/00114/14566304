The enigma of occult mitral regurgitation in a patient with cardiogenic shock. In patients with mitral regurgitation (MR), there is a high pressure gradient between the left ventricle (LV) and left atrium that Doppler echocardiography can easily detect. We present a case where transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) failed to provide an accurate evaluation of a patient who presented in cardiogenic shock. A transesophageal echocardiogram diagnosed MR because of a flail leaflet caused by a ruptured papillary muscle in the setting of normal ventricular function.
