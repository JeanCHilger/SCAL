The use of direct thrombin injection to treat a type II endoleak following endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm. This report describes the use of thrombin to treat a type II endoleak which was causing continued abdominal aortic aneurysm expansion in a patient who had undergone endovascular repair. A small quantity of thrombin was injected into the leak by a percutaneous approach directly into the aneurysm sac using color doppler ultrasound. The procedure was successful and required only a few minutes to perform. We believe this procedure is an alternative to some of the more complex and technically challenging means of treating this lesion.
