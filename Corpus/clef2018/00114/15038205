The central-venous compression syndrome: rare, but adequately treatable with endovascular stenting. Two patients, women aged 30 and 29, had severe chronic pain in the left leg, and a woman aged 36 had pain in the left flank. On the grounds of the clinical symptoms, phlebography and venous-duplex ultrasonography, a central-venous compression syndrome was diagnosed: compression of the left common iliac vein between the crossing right common iliac artery and the body of the fifth lumbar vertebra (May-Thurner syndrome). The patient with left flank pain also had haematuria. Angiography, computed tomography and phlebography revealed that these symptoms were due to compression of the left renal vein between the abdominal aorta and the superior mesenteric artery (nutcracker phenomenon). The treatment of all 3 patients consisted of venous endovascular stenting. At follow-up after 12, 30 and 15 months, respectively, the complaints had subsided considerably.
