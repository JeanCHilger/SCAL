Novel strategy for spinal cord protection during thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm surgery using Doppler ultrasonography. Paraplegia remains one of the most serious complications after thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm surgery. Spinal cord ischemia during the operation is thought to be the most important contributor to the development of this neurological deficit. So, it is important to preserve or reconstruct the critical segmental arteries for spinal cord protection. In order to identify the critical segmental arteries, we evaluate the segmental arteries by measuring the flow velocities using Doppler ultrasonography. The flow velocities are different among segmental arteries and some segmental arteries have no flow even though they are patent. Because we think that the segmental arteries with high flow velocities have much contribution to the spinal cord perfusion, we reconstruct or preserve such segmental arteries during the operation. We hope that this method would be clinically useful for spinal cord protection during thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm surgery.
