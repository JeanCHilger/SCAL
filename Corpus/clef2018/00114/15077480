Experience with saphenous-peritoneal shunts in the treatment of intractable ascites. The price and complication rates of pump models applied in the treatment of intractable ascites are significantly high. The development of a more simple, cheaper technique--using the biologically given venous valves--the saphenoperitoneal shunts became essential.In authors' department 11 saphenoperitoneal shunts have been performed on 9 patients from 01.01.2001. to 01.04.2002. After operation significant reduction in abdominal girth and increase in diuresis with diuretics in unchanged doses were observed in 6 patients decreasing their dyscomfort. In one of the patients the ligation of fistula have been needed due to peritoneal reflux, in another one severe hypoproteinaemia have developed. In 3 cases shunt occlusions have appeared: one of them have got Denver-shunt, in other case contralateral saphenoperitoneal shunt have been created with PTFE prosthesis implantation, in the third patient desobliteration have been performed with silicone drain.Significant improvement of quality of life would be caused by saphenoperitoneal shunts with minimal negative operative effects in successful cases. Besides this method is cost-effective, and has moderate and well corrigable hemodynamic effects.
