Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with stenting in extended supra-aortic artery dissection. A 51-year-old man underwent two percutaneous transluminal angioplasties with stenting for a dissection that extended from the right brachiocephalic trunk into the proximal part of the internal carotid artery. The patient presented with transient dysphasia one month after surgical treatment of a type A dissecting aortic aneurysm. Initially, he was managed with conservative treatment, with no effect on the dissected arteries. Two stents were then successfully placed over the site of dissection to prevent further embolization. At follow-up 29 months after stent implantation, the patient was asymptomatic and ultrasound examination demonstrated no recurrence of dissection at the stented segment. This case suggests that stenting could be a successful treatment of cervical artery dissection.
