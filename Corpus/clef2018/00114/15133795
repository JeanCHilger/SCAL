Incidence and characteristics of umbilical artery intermittent absent and/or reversed end-diastolic flow in complicated and uncomplicated monochorionic twin pregnancies. To evaluate the incidence and clinical relevance of intermittent absent and/or reversed diastolic flow on umbilical artery Doppler in different groups of monochorionic twin pregnancies.This was a prospective study involving three groups of monochorionic pregnancies: Group 1: controls followed fortnightly from the first trimester (n = 80) Group 2: cases with selective intrauterine growth restriction (n = 40)Intermittent absent and/or reversed diastolic flow was present in 5% (4/80) of cases in Group 1, 45% (18/40) in Group 2 and 2% (1/50) in Group 3 (P < 0.0001, Group 2 vs. 1 and 3). Placental examination was performed in 76.4% (130/170) of cases and sharing was 58% for Group 1, 81% for Group 2 and 73% for Group 3 (P < 0.0001, Groups 2 and 3 vs. 1). Large AAA were identified in all examined cases with intermittent flow (18/18) and in 3.6% (4/112) of those without. The in-utero mortality rate was 0% in Group 1 and in Group 2 fetuses without intermittent flow. However, it was 19.4% in Group 2 cases with intermittent diastolic flow.Intermittent absent and/or reversed end-diastolic flow may be considered to be a characteristic sign of monochorionic pregnancy, and seems to result from the existence of large AAA. Its incidence is significantly increased in the context of selective intrauterine growth restriction, indicating a high risk for poor pregnancy outcome in these cases.
