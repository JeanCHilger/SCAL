Evaluation of a soft atherosclerotic lesion in the rabbit aorta by an invasive IVUS method versus a non-invasive MRI technology. The intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) modality has rapidly gained acceptance for the measurement of arterial plaque thickness and for anatomical characterization. In view, however, of the growing interest in the direct assessment of plaque size after therapeutic modalities directly reducing plaque burden, a non-invasive method such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be of help for repeated evaluations. The two methods were compared directly on a focal plaque developed at the abdominal aortic level by a combination of local electric lesion followed by a hypercholesterolemic diet. The plaque was fully characterized histopathologically at intervals up to 120 days from lesion induction, and maximal plaque formation was detected at 90 days from electrical injury. Plaques could be well assessed by IVUS at each time point analyzed and data correlated very well to histopathologic findings (r = 0.969, P = 0.0014). The MRI technology provided reliable determinations only at 90 days after lesion induction, i.e. at maximal plaque formation, with excellent correspondence to IVUS determinations (r = 0.989, P = 0.0111). Altogether these findings indicate that the non-invasive MRI technology, when applied to the analysis of arterial plaques of adequate size, can be used successfully for plaque determination, with results comparable to the invasive IVUS technique.
