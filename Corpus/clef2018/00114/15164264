Role of duplex arteriography as the sole preoperative imaging modality prior to lower extremity revascularization surgery in diabetic and renal patients. The limitations and complications associated with contrast angiography (CA) prior to lower extremity revascularization have led to an increased interest in duplex arteriography (DA) as a potential replacement. We report our experience with DA in patients with diabetes and/or chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) that would particularly benefit from a noninvasive approach to preoperative evaluation of the arterial tree. From January 1998 to November 2000, DA was performed in 145 patients with diabetes mellitus and/or CRI prior to 180 arterial reconstructions. One hundred twenty-one procedures were performed on 91 patients with diabetes alone, 41 on 33 patients with diabetes and CRI, and 18 on 15 patients with CRI alone. Patient ages ranged from 36 to 98 years (mean 72 +/- 12 years). Indications for surgery were severe claudication in 33 (18%), rest pain in 37 (21%), nonhealing ischemic ulcers in 52 (29%), and limb gangrene in 58 (32%). Optimal inflow and outflow anastomotic sites were selected according to a diagram based on DA that included arterial tree imaging from mid-aorta to the pedal vessels. Preoperative contrast arteriography was performed in 16 cases (9%) because of extremely poor runoff based on DA and limited visualization of outflow vessels. The distal anastomosis was to the popliteal artery in 89 cases (49%) and to the tibial and pedal arteries in 91 (51%). Intraoperative findings confirmed the preoperative DA results with the exception of one (0.6%) where the distal anastomosis was placed proximal to a significant stenosis requiring an extension graft. The use of DA presents a safe and reliable option to prebypass CA for many patients with diabetes or CRI. The ease of use and favorable patient outcomes achieved by this imaging modality may rival the use of CA for these patients.
