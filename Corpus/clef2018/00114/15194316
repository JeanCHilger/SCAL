Results of 60 consecutive hepatectomies for pediatric living donor liver transplantation. Several technical improvements have been made to increase donor pool for pediatric liver transplantation, including reduced-size grafts, split-liver, and recently living donors. The objective of the present study is to report our single-center experience with 60 hepatectomies for living donor liver transplantation in pediatric recipients between June 2000 and December 2002. Donor workup consisted of a complete history and physical examination followed by laboratory test and liver function tests. Graft size was estimated using computed tomography scan or abdominal ultrasound. Liver biopsy was performed in all donors. Arteriogram was performed to evaluate hepatic arterial anatomy. All donors survived the procedure. Only seven patients experienced complications (10.2%), most of which were short term. We conclude that liver living donation for pediatric population is a safe procedure.
