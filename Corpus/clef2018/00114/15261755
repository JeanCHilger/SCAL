What's new in vascular ultrasound. Duplex ultrasound has long been the method of choice in the diagnosis and evaluation of deep venous thrombosis and carotid artery stenosis and in monitoring lower extremity bypasses. In recent years, innovative procedures and technology have fostered new applications for duplex ultrasound, such as detection of in-stent stenosis and endoleaks, intraoperative evaluation of in situ vein bypasses and monitoring of endovenous procedures, and treatment of common femoral pseudoaneurysms. The low cost and noninvasiveness of duplex ultrasound make it ideal for such studies,as well as for screening for asymptomatic vascular disease.
