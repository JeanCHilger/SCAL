Early endothelial dysfunction in cholesterol-fed rabbits: a non-invasive in vivo ultrasound study. Endothelial function in hypercholesterolemic rabbits is usually evaluated ex vivo on isolated aortic rings. In vivo evaluation requires invasive imaging procedures that cannot be repeated serially.We evaluated a non-invasive ultrasound technique to assess early endothelial function in rabbits and compare data with ex vivo measurements.Twenty-four rabbits (fed with a cholesterol diet (0.5%) for 2 to 8 weeks) were given progressive infusions of acetylcholine (0.05-0.5 microg/kg/min) and their endothelial function was assessed in vivo by transcutaneous vascular ultrasound of the abdominal aorta. Ex vivo endothelial function was evaluated on isolated aortic rings and compared to in vivo data.Significant endothelial dysfunction was demonstrated in hypercholesterolemic animals as early as 2 weeks after beginning the cholesterol diet (aortic cross-sectional area variation: -2.9% vs. +4% for controls, p < 0.05). Unexpectedly, response to acetylcholine at 8 weeks was more variable. Endothelial function improved in 5 rabbits while 2 rabbits regained a normal endothelial function. These data corroborated well with ex vivo results.Endothelial function can be evaluated non-invasively in vivo by transcutaneous vascular ultrasound of the abdominal aorta in the rabbit and results correlate well with ex vivo data.
