Vena contracta width as a simple method of assessing mitral valve regurgitation. Comparison with Doppler quantitative methods. Quantitative Doppler echocardiography and proximal flow convergence methods facilitate quantification of regurgitant volume (RV), regurgitant fraction (RF) and the measurement of effective regurgitant orifice (ERO) to define mitral regurgitation (MR) severity. Vena contracta width (VCW) has been proposed as a simple, accurate marker of MR, and is instrumental in predicting the angiographic severity of valvular regurgitation. The study aim was to compare VCW with quantitative Doppler methods and angiography for assessing MR.Sixty-four patients with MR (50 males mean age 54 +/- 8 yearsA good correlation was found between VCW and ERO (r2 = 0.70, p <0.001), RV (r2 = 0.73, p <0.001), RF (r2 = 0.71, p <0.001) and angiographic grade (r2 = 0.72, p <0.001).VCW measured by color Doppler correlates well with MR severity. In addition, VCW is a simple, reproducible quantitative measurement of MR, and is recommended for use in the non-invasive assessment of the condition.
