Immediate evaluation of angioplasty and stenting results in supra-aortic arteries by use of a Doppler-tipped guidewire. Intra-arterial Doppler sonography may complement arteriography by providing immediate physiological evidence of hemodynamic adequacy and by obviating unnecessary angioplastic dilation. We used a Doppler-tipped guidewire in 16 patients and obtained velocity measurements at the site of stenosis immediately before and after carotid artery stenting (CAS) in 10 patients. Intra-arterial Doppler sonography confirmed hemodynamic improvement immediately after stent placement and correlated well with post-CAS duplex Doppler sonography results. Thus, intra-arterial Doppler sonography can be feasibly incorporated into CAS procedures for hemodynamic evaluation and can provide anatomic information that complements information provided by angiography.
