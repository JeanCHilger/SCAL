Aortic anastomotic pseudoaneurysms: US, CT, MR, and angiography. Correlation of imaging and anatomic findings in seven men with abdominal aortic graft prostheses (four "end-to-end" anastomoses and three "end-to-side" anastomoses) was done to compare the value of different imaging modalities in detecting postoperative complications, especially aortic anastomotic pseudoaneurysms (AAPs). In all cases, angiographic and CT studies were carried out. In six patients ultrasound and MR examinations were also performed. Anatomic verification was obtained by surgery in six patients and autopsy in one case. Five patients had an AAP (four at surgery and one at autopsy), one had a true abdominal aortic aneurysm above the anastomosis, and one a nondetectable abnormality of the aortic suture line. Digital subtraction angiography diagnosed one of five AAPs, missed the true aneurysm in the sixth patient, and was normal in the patient without any aneurysm. Computed tomography correctly diagnosed the five AAPs and the true aneurysm and was normal in the last patient. Ultrasound correctly diagnosed the AAPs in three of four patients, incorrectly diagnosed an AAP in the patient who had the true aneurysm, and was normal in the patient without any aneurysm. Magnetic resonance diagnosed four of four AAPs and the true aneurysm and was normal in the last patient. Computed tomography seems to be the best imaging modality with which to diagnose and evaluate an aortic AAP in patients with aortoiliofemoral graft prosthesis.
