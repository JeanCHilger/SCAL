True aneurysm formation in axillofemoral bypass with a reinforced ePTFE graft-a case report. Since improvement in reinforced expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) grafts, true aneurysm and pseudoaneurysm formation have become relatively rare complications after axillofemoral reconstruction. This is a case report of a true aneurysm of an axillofemoral graft. The true aneurysm occurred 29 months after insertion of a reinforced ePTFE graft for aortoiliac occlusive disease. A mid-graft true aneurysm was identified during examinations without any trauma history. Continuous long-term follow-up is recommended for these reinforced ePTFE grafts because of rare aneurysm formation, preferably using duplex ultrasonography.
