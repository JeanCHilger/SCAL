Postoperative alterations in size of Dacron aortic grafts: an ultrasonic evaluation. Reports of aneurysmal dilatation involving Dacron aortic prostheses have raised questions concerning the incidence, degree and significance of postoperative alterations in graft size. Consequently, a study was undertaken to evaluate Dacron graft size by ultrasooud in 95 asymptomatic patients selected at random after aortic surgery. A Vidison Real Time ultrasound unit was used to determine the internal diameter of the aortic portion of the various grafts utilized: 41 Cooley knitted, 25 Vasculour-D 13 U.S.C.I. ultralightweight
