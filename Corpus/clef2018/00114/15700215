Abdominal ultrasound after endoscopic or percutaneous stenting and drainage. Stents and prostheses in the hepatobiliary system are visible by ultrasound examination and can be checked for their function. The reappearance of mechanical cholestasis, stent dislocation or formation of sludge on the stent tip is signs of stent dysfunction. Graduation of the biliary obstruction can help to find the best time for changing the stent. After intervention hematoma, abscess, intraabdominal fluid or gas may occur and can be diagnosed by ultrasound. Tumor stenosis in the gastrointestinal tract can be treated by self expandable metallic stents. Ultrasound helps to localize the stent in the correct position and to observe the reduction of occlusive ileus. Percutaneous and gastrointestinal drainage of pancreatic cysts, necrosis and abscesses are often controlled by ultrasound to evaluate size, echogenicity and localized pain. Many procedures and interventions in gastroenterology can be monitored by an experienced ultrasound examiner in an effective and inexpensive manner.
