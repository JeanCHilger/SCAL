Spectral Doppler characterization of endoleaks following endoluminal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Colour Doppler ultrasound of endoluminal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair is becoming an established imaging technique in identifying endoleak. Management and treatment of endoleak is determined in part by the exact nature of the endoleak, namely its type and whether it has single or multiple vessel inflow and outflow. To date, spectral Doppler waveform analysis has provided some information about the propensity for spontaneous seal of isolated type II endoleaks, rather than assisting in their classification.We present a collection of three case reports outlining the directionality/phasicity of the Doppler waveform profile associated with endoleaks whose type and subtype (uni- /or multi-conduital) were angiographically determined.In all three cases uniconduital type II endoleak demonstrated a to-and-fro waveform on Doppler ultrasound imaging.To-and-fro Doppler waveforms may be associated with uniconduital type II endoleaks. If upon investigation of further cases this is found to be the case, this waveform classification may facilitate determination of the subtype (uni- or multi-conduital) of endoleak, thus identifying those cases which may be more amenable to percutaneous repair.
