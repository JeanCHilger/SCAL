Spiral CT in aortic dissection. Patients with suspected dissection of the thoracic aorta require immediate diagnostic evaluation so that urgent therapeutic interventions can begin. Two women with suspected aortic dissection and one man with abdominal aortic aneurysm underwent color-flow Doppler echocardiography and CT angiography with multiplanar reconstructions. Spiral CT showed ascending aortic dissection (type A Stanford) in two cases and descending aortic dissection (type B Stanford) in one case. It also access the visualization of the intimal flap, the extent of dissection, the size of the aorta, and the presence of pericardial fluid. CT angiography is an accurate diagnostic procedure for patients with suspected aortic dissection and possesses several advantages over other modalities such as transthoracic echocardiography, transesophageal echocardiography and aortography.
