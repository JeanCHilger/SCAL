Supra-aortic extracranial revascularization in cerebrovascular disorders with special reference to stage classification. The opinions concerning the value of a surgical approach in cerebrovascular insufficiency due to extracranial occlusive arterial disease are still controverse. We analysed a consecutive series of 216 patients after carotid endarterectomy performed in the period of 1980 to 1988. The preoperative symptoms permitted a classification into the clinical groups I to IV according to Vollmar. All operations were done under standard conditions. An intraluminal shunt was used in 194 patients (90%). In 24 patients (11%) a bilateral carotid revascularisation was carried out. The hospital mortality rate in our groups of patients was 5.1%. In order to evaluate the results, Doppler sonographic and clinical examinations with a mean follow-up of 8.1 months (range: 3 to 60 months) were performed. The neurologic examination revealed an unchanged condition in 63 patients (29%). Twelve patients (5.7%) suffered from a progression of the neurologic disorders.
