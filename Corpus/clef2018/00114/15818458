Aneurysm sac thrombus load predicts type II endoleaks after endovascular aneurysm repair. Type II endoleaks are associated with the absence of aneurysm shrinkage after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR). This study aims at determining the predictability of this complication, whose potential risk factors have been the subject of conflicting reports. Preoperative computed tomography (CT) scans of 178 patients who underwent EVAR for true infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms between January 20, and April 17, 2003, with a minimum follow-up of 30 days, were reviewed. The following information was retrieved: maximum aneurysm diameter, aneurysm thrombus load (maximum thickness, percentage of sac circumference wall coverage, percentage of maximum sac area occupancy) number, diameter, and nature (lumbar, inferior mesenteric, accessory renal, middle sacral) of patent aortic side-branch arteries
