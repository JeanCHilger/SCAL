An inflammatory aneurysm of the abdominal aorta. Inflammatory aneurysm of the abdominal aorta is a rare disorder, affecting approximately 3-10% of the population with a diagnosis of the abdominal aortic aneurysm. The principal etiological agents of the disorder include bacterial microorganisms, primarily Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. However, in many cases the etiology od the disorder remains unclear and, likely, autoimmune and genetic dispositions may play a certain role, as well. The principal diagnostic procedures include ultrasound, CT and MRI examinations. The principal therapeutic procedures include open resection of the inflammatory aneurysm with complete removal of the infectious tissue and its replacement by a prosthesis or a vascular allograft "in situ" or through an extraantomical reconstructive procedure. New procedures also include endovascular therapy which is technically much simpler, less demanding for a patient, however, it may leave a potential infectious focus in the organism with a risk of further septic complications to follow. Therefore, the authors recommend a strictly individual treatment strategy in each patient with this serious disorder. In case of positive cultivation bacteriological findings, extended (a minimum of 6 weeks) antibiotic therapy and regular, long-term patient follow-up with regular visits, are essential.
