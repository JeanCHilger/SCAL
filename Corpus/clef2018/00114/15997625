Endovascular treatment with bifurcated stent-grafts in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms. During past few years endovascular procedures at patients with abdominal aorta aneurysm (AAA) have widely replaced surgical treatment. The interest put in endovascular treatment is high. The number of patients being operated by the use of this method has been growing.The objective of this article was the evaluation of the results of the endovascular treatment with 42 patients with abdominal aorta aneurysms.All patients (38 men and 4 women, mean age 65 years) belong to the high risk group. The qualification for the endovascular treatment was after the clinical examination and angio-CT, abdominal and pelvis digital subtraction angiography (DSA). 36 operations were performed under supradural anesthesia and 6 under general anesthesia. Among all patients implanted bifurcated abdominal stent-grafts Zenith (COOK) fixing above the renal arteries.All operations were ended with success. Some early complications were. the leakage to sack of aneurysm, thrombosis of a leg of stent-graft, the curve of a leg, the growth of the thrombus in stent-graft. All patients had the control examinations (abdominal-rtg, pelvis-rtg, USG-color Doppler and angio-CT) immediately after the operation and successively after 1, 3 and 6 months.1. The endovascular procedure among patients with AAA by means of bifurcated aortic stent-grafts is in many cases a principal method of treatment. 2. Early results of endovascular treatment are good. 3. Longer follow-up is needed for the evaluation of late results.
