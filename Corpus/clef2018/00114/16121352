A resected case of advanced duodenal carcinoma with occlusion of the celiac artery. A 75-year-old woman with vomiting, admitted on March 7 2002, was diagnosed with advanced duodenal carcinoma based on ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance cholangio-ancreatography (MRCP), percutaneus transhepatic cholangiography. Angiography showed the celiac artery to be occluded. The common hepatic artery was demonstrated via the gastroduodenal artery (GDA). We conducted a probe laparotomy and resected connective tissue with the celiac ganglion and lymph nodes surrounding the celiac artery. The frozen specimen showed no malignancy. Then the celiac artery was exposed and celiac axis compression syndrome was not seen. A portion of the greater saphenous vein was taken from the patient's right thigh and grafted between the common hepatic artery and the supraceliac portion of the aorta. One end of the saphenous vein was anastomosed to the side of the common hepatic artery. The other end of the saphenous vein was anstomosed to the aorta in an end to side fashion. After the reconstruction of celiac circulation, we performed radical pancreaticoduodenectomy. The postoperative course was not eventful and the patient was discharged from the hospital 5 weeks after surgery.
