Stent migration complicating treatment of inferior vena cava stenosis after orthotopic liver transplantation. A case of inferior vena cava (IVC) stenosis after orthotopic liver transplantation was treated with balloon angioplasty and Wallstent placement. There was stent migration into the right atrium (RA), and percutaneous removal of the stent was attempted without success. Open cardiac surgery was required for stent removal and repair of aortic/RA fistula. Months later, recurrent IVC stenosis was successfully treated with placement of large Z stents after additional failed surgical repair. At 2 years follow-up, the patient is asymptomatic and Doppler ultrasonography demonstrated the stent to be patent and well-positioned.
