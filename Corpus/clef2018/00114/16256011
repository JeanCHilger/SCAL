Coarctation of the aorta. Coarctation of the aorta is an important, treatable cause of secondary hypertension. Its prevalence varies from 5% to 8% of all congenital heart defects. This condition is most often detected because of a murmur or hypertension found on routine examination. Delayed or absent femoral pulses and an arm/leg systolic blood pressure difference of 20 mm Hg or more in favor of the arms may be considered as evidence for aortic coarctation. The coarctation may be demonstrated on a suprasternal notch two-dimensional echocardiographic view along with increased Doppler flow velocities across the coarctation site. Cardiac catheterization reveals significant systolic pressure gradient (> 20 mm Hg) across the coarctation and angiography demonstrates the degree and type of aortic narrowing. Aortic obstruction may be relieved by surgery or by transcatheter techniques the latter include balloon angioplasty and stent implantation. In the past, surgery has been used exclusively, but because of morbidity and complications associated with surgery, catheter techniques are increasingly used in the management of aortic coarctation. Balloon angioplasty in children and stents in adolescents and adults are becoming initial therapeutic options for management of coarctation. Studies evaluating long-term follow-up results of the interventional techniques are needed.
