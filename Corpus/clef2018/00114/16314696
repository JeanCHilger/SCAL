Magnetic resonance angiography of abdominal and lower extremity vasculature. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) has evolved over the past years from an experimental imaging modality to a technique that is now widely applied in clinical practice. This article reviews the fundamentals of the different magnetic resonance angiographic techniques and how they can be applied for abdominal and peripheral arterial imaging. Currently, contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA), whereby a luminogram is obtained during initial arterial passage of contrast material, is the most widely used technique. With current hardware and software, high-spatial resolution images of the abdominal aorta and proximal visceral branches can be obtained that are equivalent to intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (IA-DSA). High-quality imaging of the renal arteries demands isotropic voxels and reformations orthogonal to the vessel axis for evaluation. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography of the peripheral vascular tree is now a highly accurate technique and has replaced diagnostic intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography and duplex ultrasonography in many hospitals.
