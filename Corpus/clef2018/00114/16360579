True and false aneurysms of the femoral artery. True aneurysms of the femoral artery are uncommon. They are most often identified in elderly males and are frequently associated with aneurysms at other locations. Femoral artery aneurysms that are symptomatic or larger than 2.5 cm should be repaired in order to prevent limb-threatening complications, such as rupture, thrombosis, or embolization. Open repair is the standard method of treatment and should be preceded by evaluation for coexisting aortoiliac or popliteal aneurysms, assessment of superficial femoral artery patency, and determination of the point of origin of the deep femoral artery relative to the aneurysm sac. Femoral artery pseudoaneurysms are most often seen in the setting of previous femoral artery catheterization but may also be associated with trauma, anastomotic leakage, or infection. The majority of femoral pseudoaneurysms less than 3 cm in diameter will spontaneously thrombose and may be observed with serial duplex ultrasound exams in asymptomatic patients. Symptomatic pseudoaneurysms, pseudoaneurysms with a diameter greater than 3 cm, and those found in patients who are anticoagulated should usually be treated. Ultrasound-guided thrombin injection is our preferred method for treating femoral pseudoaneurysm because of its low risk, high success rate, and efficacy in the setting of anticoagulation. Ultrasound-guided compression is an alternative method that may be considered when thrombin products are contraindicated. Open pseudoaneurysm repair should be undertaken in the setting of infection, rapid expansion, or if less-invasive methods are not technically feasible.
