Aorto-caval fistulas: a review of eighteen years experience. The operative treatment of 26 aorto-caval fistulas during the last 18 years is reviewed (24 male and two female patients average of 65.3 year). Out of 1698 cases presenting an abdominal aortic aneurysm, 406 presented with rupture, and 26 had aorto caval fistula. In 24 cases (92.3%) it concerned an atherosclerotic aneurysm. One aneurysm with aorto-caval fistula was secondary to abdominal blunt trauma (3.8%), and one due to iatrogenic injury (3.8%). The time interval between first clinical signs of aorto-caval fistula and diagnosis, ranged from 6 hours to 2 years (average 57,3 days). Clinical presentation included congestive heart failure infive patients (11.5%), extreme leg edema in 13 (50.0%), hematuria in 2 (7.0%), renal insufficiency 2 (7.0%), and scrotal edema in six patients. Diagnosis was made by means of color duplex scan in eight patients (30.7%), CT in seven patients (27%), NMR in three patients (11.5%), and angiography in seven patients (27%). Most reliable physical sign was an abdominal bruit,present in 20 patients (77%). In ten patients (38.4%) correct diagnosis was not made prior to surgery. The operative treatment consisted of transaortic suture of the vena cava (25 pts-96.0%), and aneurysm repair. Five operative deaths occurred (19,2%), and for all of them it concerned a misdiagnosis. Cause of death was myocardial infarction (one patient-3.8%), massive bleeding (one patient-3.8%), MOF (two patients-7, 0%), and colon gangrene (one patient-3.8%). Follow-up period varied from six months to 18 years (mean 4 years and two months). Long term results showed a 96% patency rate. No postoperative lower extremity venous insufficiency nor pelvic venous hypertension was observed post-operatively.
