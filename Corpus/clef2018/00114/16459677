Treatment of inferior caliceal stones by flexible ureteroscopy. Evaluation of the treatment of inferior caliceal stones by flexible ureterorenoscopy and Holinium-YAG laser on a series of 69 operations.Between April 1998 and December 2003, 69 flexible ureteroscopies were performed for 55 stones in 49 patients. The mean age of the patients was 51.6 years (range: 18-78). The mean stone diameter was 12.8 mm (range: 5-3 1). 46% of stones had been pretreated by ESWL, PCNL or surgery. Endocorporeal lithotripsy was performed by Holmium-YAG laser in 45 cases, Lithoclast in 5 cases and en bloc extraction in 3 cases. Technical features, efficacy and morbidity were studied. The results were classified into fragment-free (FS), residual fragments (RF) < or = 4 mm, RF > 4 mm and failures. The results were evaluated on D0-D1 and at 3 months on a plain abdominal x-ray and ultrasound.The mean operating time was 61 minutes (range: 25-120). Nine stones required several procedures. 20% of stones were cystine stones. A ureteric stent was placed in 67 cases. The mean length of stay was 2.5 days (D0-D8). At 3 months, after one or several ureteroscopies, the results were: 22% FS, 40% RF < or = 4 mm, 13% RF > 4 mm and 25% failures. One half of failures occurred during the first 14 ureteroscopy procedures. There were 13 minor complications and no major complications.The results of flexible ureteroscopy in the treatment of inferior caliceal stones are encouraging, especially with standardization of the technique. It appears to be a good compromise between ESWL and PCNL, particularly for stones between 10 and 20 mm, cystine stones and after failure of reference techniques.
