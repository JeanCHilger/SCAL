Carotid endarterectomy may reduce the high stroke rate for patients with the disease of abdominal aorta and peripheral arteries. The prevalence of carotid stenosis is reported to be high among patients with arteriosclerosis, but the hazards of carotid stenosis and the benefits of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) on long-term event-free survival are still unknown. The aim of this prospective study was to screen preoperative patients with arterial disease for carotid stenosis, and to determine whether CEA had any effect on stroke during the postoperative follow-up period.From 1999 to 2003, 406 consecutive preoperative patients with arterial disease underwent routine carotid duplex scan. Patients with known carotid stenosis and those due to undergo operation in emergency were excluded from the study. CEA was performed before or simultaneously with vascular surgery if necessary. The prevalence and risk factors for carotid stenosis were studied, and the patients were followed up for stroke or death.Among the 406 patients examined, 19.4% had greater than 50% stenosis and 11.3% had greater than 70% stenosis. The risk factors for carotid stenosis were having occlusive arterial disease (P=0.0001), and history of stroke (P=0.0038). Long-term follow-up study revealed that patients with greater than 70% carotid stenosis without CEA had a higher tendency for stroke or death, but the stroke rate in patients with severe stenosis who underwent CEA remained low, as in patients with less than 70% stenosis.Patients with greater than 70% carotid stenosis, diagnosed before arterial operation who did not undergo CEA, had a higher risk for stroke during the postoperative follow-up period. However, their risk could be reduced by performing CEA before or simultaneously with scheduled vascular surgery.
