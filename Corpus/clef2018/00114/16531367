A new model of abdominal aortic aneurysm with gastric serosa patch: surgical technique and short-term evaluation. The purpose of this work was to develop an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) model that resembles human aneurysms with potential for further growth, patent collateral vessels, and a predictable tendency to rupture, and that can be used in the development of new endoprostheses and implant training. An infrarenal AAA model was created in five domestic swine using an autologous gastric serosal patch. Pre- and postsurgical digital subtraction aortograms (DSA) were obtained to document the appearance and dimensions of the aneurysm. Animals were followed up with DSA and ultrasonography on days 7, 14, 30, 45, 60, and 90 after model creation. Aneurysmal diameters were measured with both techniques in all examinations. On day 90, animals were euthanized, target arteries were harvested, and pathological evaluation was performed. The nonparametric Wilcoxon test was used to assess any differences in measured diameters. All the animals survived the surgical procedure. The aneurysmal diameters increased from 8.14+/- 2.15 to 13.28+/- 1.18 mm immediately after surgery (p < .05), but no subsequent significant growth of the aneurysmal sac was seen during follow-up. In this experimental setting, measurements obtained with DSA were slightly larger than those obtained with ultrasound. Two animals died of AAA rupture on days 6 and 10 (40% rupture rate). Pathological examination showed lack of elastic laminae and increased collagen content in the aortic patch. Thus, model showed a tendency to rupture, but no significant potential for further aneurysmal growth. It might be useful for training in endovascular therapies, but its usefulness for preclinical endovascular device testing is limited by its lack of growth potential.
