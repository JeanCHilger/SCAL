Localized fluid collections after liver transplantation. Liver transplantation is an accepted effective therapy for patients with diseases that lead to hepatic failure. In addition to vascular, rejection-related, biliary, and lymphoproliferative complications, posttransplantation fluid collections, such as hematomas, seromas, bilomas, localized ascites, and abscesses can affect graft survival. In this study, we have presented, ultrasonography and computed tomography images as well as reviewed the literature.Between December 1988 and March 2005, 138 patients (94 men [68.11%], 44 women [31.89%] of mean age, 26.77 years (range, 1 to 64) underwent liver transplantation in our institution from living-related donors in 85 and deceased donors in 53 recipients. This retrospective study analyzed the fluid collections diagnosed after liver transplantation.Among 138 liver transplants we identified 56 localized intra-abdominal fluid collections, including 46 hematomas, 4 bilomas, and 6 abscesses. Fluid collections were noticed between 0 and 1095 days (mean = 13.50 +/- 152.82 days). Thirty-three collections were identified in living-related, and 23 in deceased donor recipients. The collections showed an average volume of 375 cm3, with a range of 1 to 4368 cm3. Two cases of bilomas were related to hepatic arterial insufficiency, one from a hepatic artery occlusion and the other from a significant stenosis.Localized intra-abdominal fluid collections were commonly seen after liver transplantations, diminished in size without treatment, but required aspiration or drainage in some patients.
