Transcatheter closure of ruptured sinus of valsalva aneurysm using Amplatzer duct occluder. The present study was conducted to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of transcatheter closure of ruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm (RSVA).Four patients (3 females) aged 7-57 years with RSVA (3 congenital RSVA and 1 post-surgery RSVA) were involved in the present study. Two-dimensional and color Doppler echocardiography revealed the ruptures of right coronary sinus into right ventricle in all cases. The echo estimated size of the defect was 2-10 mm. After the establishment of the arterio-venous wire loop, Amplatzer Duct Occluder (ADO) was successfully deployed by antegrade venous approach in all patients. The diameter of the occluder was chosen to be at least 1 to 2 mm larger than defect.The defects were successfully occluded without any complications. On the follow-up 3 months after operation, there was no device embolization, infective endocarditis and aortic regurgitation.Transcatheter closure is a feasible and effective modality for RSVA without other anomalies.
