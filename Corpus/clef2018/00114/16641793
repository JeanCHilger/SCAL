Aortic endografts: detecting endoleaks using contrast-enhanced ultrasound. Evaluation of aortic endografts is an exciting new application for contrast enhanced ultrasound. Detection of endoleaks is critical as they may lead to progressive enlargement of a treated aneurysm with a risk of aneurysm rupture. In this article, contrast enhanced ultrasound is presented as a potentially accurate, safe and economical alternative to CTA, the current practice standard, for endoleak detection.
