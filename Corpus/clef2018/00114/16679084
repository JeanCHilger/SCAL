Intravascular ultrasonic differences between aorto-ostial and shaft narrowing in saphenous veins used as aortocoronary bypass grafts. Previous studies have reported differences in interventional complication rates that depend on saphenous vein graft (SVG) lesion location. However, little is known about morphologic differences between lesions in different SVG locations. We evaluated preintervention intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) images of 75 de novo SVG lesions (aorto-ostial, n = 15 shaft, n = 60) in 63 patients. IVUS data were measured at the minimal lumen area and at 2 proximal and 2 distal references. Positive remodeling was defined as a lesion site SVG area that was larger than the average of the 2 distal references. Shaft lesions more often contained soft plaque (60.0% vs 26.7%, p = 0.02). Minimal lumen areas were identical (4.5 +/- 2.9 vs 4.3 +/- 1.5 mm2, p = 0.3)
