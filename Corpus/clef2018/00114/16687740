Diagnostic value of color duplex ultrasonography in the follow-up of endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm. To systematically review the findings of diagnostic value of color duplex ultrasound (US) in the follow-up of endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs).A search of PubMed and Medline databases for English-language literature was performed to find studies published between 1991 and 2005. Studies comparing the diagnostic accuracy of color duplex US with that of computed tomographic (CT) angiography were included, and analysis was performed of the detection of endoleaks and measurement of aneurysm diameter.Twenty-one studies (39 separate comparisons) met the criteria and were included for analysis. Pooled estimates of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of color duplex US compared with CT angiography (with 95% CIs) were 66% (52%-81%), 93% (89%-97%), 76% (65%-87%), 90% (86%-95%), and 91% (86%-97%), respectively, for unenhanced color duplex US and 81% (52%-100%), 82% (68%-97%), 58% (26%-90%), 95% (87%-100%), and 98% (91%-100%), respectively, for enhanced color duplex US. The sensitivity in the detection of endoleak was significantly improved with contrast material-enhanced color duplex US compared with unenhanced color duplex US (P < .05)Color duplex US is not as accurate as CT angiography and cannot replace CT angiography in the follow-up of endovascular aortic repair of AAAs. However, the use of contrast material-enhanced color duplex US resulted in improvement of diagnostic accuracy in the detection of endoleak and warrants further study.
