Acute necrotizing pancreatitis as a rare complication of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is considered the standard treatment for most renal and upper ureteral stones. Some centers use ESWL to treat bile duct stones and pancreatic calculi. Although ESWL is generally considered safe and effective, major complications, including acute pancreatitis, perirenal hematoma, urosepsis, venous thrombosis, biliary obstruction, bowel perforation, lung injury, rupture of an aortic aneurysm and intracranial hemorrhage, have been reported to occur in less than 1% of patients. Here, we present an extremely rare case of acute necrotizing pancreatitis occurring after ESWL for a right-sided urinary stone, which was treated by non-operative percutaneous interventions.
