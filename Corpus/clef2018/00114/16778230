Midterm follow-up of a single-center experience of endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms with use of the Talent stent-graft. To review the midterm results of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) with the Talent stent-graft.All patients who underwent EVAR of AAAs with Talent stent-grafts from February 1998 to April 2002 at a single institution were monitored for a minimum of 2 years or until an endpoint of death or rupture was reached.There were 68 eligible patients, who were monitored for a mean period of 39 months (range, 24-72 months). Forty-nine (72.9%) were alive at 2 years among the 19 deaths, two resulted from aneurysm rupture and the other 17 were unrelated to EVAR. There was one immediate conversion to open repair and five primary proximal endoleaksEVAR of AAAs with use of the Talent stent-graft is a promising and acceptable alternative to open surgery. Our 30-day mortality rate of zero compares extremely well with historical data from open surgery and the findings of more recently published trials. The risk of endoleak and uncertainty over durability require long-term surveillance.
