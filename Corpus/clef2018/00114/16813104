Aortic valve replacement with a 16-mm CarboMedics valve in adult patients. Management of the small aortic root is a significant problem for the surgeon with regard to operative technique and selection of the prosthesis. We report on four adults with a small aortic root who underwent aortic valve replacement with a 16-mm CarboMedics bileaflet valve. All patients now lead normal lives. Postoperative Doppler measurements demonstrated an acceptable transprosthetic gradient.
