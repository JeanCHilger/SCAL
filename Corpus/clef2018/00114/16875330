Long-term computed tomography follow-up after open surgical repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms. To describe the findings on computed tomography (CT) of the aortic sac (AS) in patients operated on for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with insertion of a coated Dacron prosthesis.A prospective study of 36 consecutive patients operated on for AAA over 2 years and followed longitudinally with CT for up to 10 years.All patients had a fluid-filled AS on CT 7-10 days postoperatively. At 6 months, the AS had decreased in most patients, mainly in the antero-posterior diameter, and in two had disappeared completely. In five patients with complications, the AS increased in size. The AS disappeared completely at 10 years' follow-up in 13 patients. When present, a retroperitoneal hematoma always disappeared after 6 months.These data indicate that the AS after graft implantation will diminish gradually but will persist for at least 6 months. Usually the transverse diameter is bigger than the antero-posterior diameter. If the AS enlarges and becomes rounded and distended with an inhomogeneous interior, it might be a sign of graft infection. In these cases an ultrasound-guided or CT-guided puncture is recommended.
