Is radiation a risk factor for atherosclerosis? An echo-color Doppler study on Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin patients. The aim of the present paper was to study the role of irradiation in the atherosclerotic process in patients affected by Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.We studied 84 subjects, 42 with Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin disease and 42 controls. All 42 cases had been irradiated and were comparable in terms of risk factors for atherosclerosis. All 84 subjects underwent echo-color Doppler of the arterial axis (carotids, abdominal aorta, and femoral arteries), and the intima-media thickness was measured.The irradiated cases had a greater intima-media thickness in the carotid district, even after dividing them according to age and sex males were affected more than females. The irradiated patients were at greater risk of developing cardiovascular events than the controls.An echo-color Doppler of the carotid district is advisable in all patients who have been submitted to radiotherapy, and the patients with a significantly greater than normal intima-media thickness need a strict follow-up, and antioxidant or antiaggregant therapy should be considered.
