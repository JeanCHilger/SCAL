Antegrade revascularization for chronic mesenteric ischaemia. to evaluate the short- and long-term results, obtained after open revascularization for chronic mesenteric ischaemia as a reference in a field with growing interest for PTA and stenting.we reviewed 14 patients with 15 antegrade revascularizations for chronic intestinal ischaemia, between 1996 and 2003: ten bypasses either to the celiac trunk or to the mesenteric artery and five bifurcated bypasses to both arteries were performed. There was one reimplantation for Wilki syndrome. Graft patency was monitored for a mean period of 24 months (range 1-84 months) by clinical examination and duplex scanning.one patient had recurrence of symptoms that disappeared after successful reoperation. There was one perioperative death All the other patients (84%) had a long-term symptom free survival.antegrade mesenterial revascularization through an upper abdominal approach is an excellent technique with good long-term results. It sets a high standard that will be difficult to obtain with mesenteric PTA and stenting. It remains the preferred method of revascularization in low-risk patients.
