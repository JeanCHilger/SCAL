Imaging of aortic abnormalities with contrast-enhanced ultrasound. A pictorial comparison with CT. Aortic abnormalities are commonly encountered and may represent a diagnostic challenge in patients with acute or chronic clinical symptoms. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) with low mechanical index (low MI) is a new promising method in the diagnosis and follow-up of pathological aortic lesions. CEUS with SonoVue allows a more rapid and noninvasive diagnosis, especially in critical patients because of its bedside availability. This review compares CEUS findings with those documented on computed tomography angiography (CTA), allowing the reader to appreciate the usefulness of CEUS in this clinical situation.
