Glomerular filtration rate after left renal vein division and reconstruction during infrarenal aortic aneurysm repair. The study assessed the effect on postoperative renal function of left renal vein (LRV) division and reconstruction by direct reanastomosis or graft interposition during infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair.Between January 2001 and March 2006, 1189 patients underwent elective open repair of infrarenal AAAs. LRV division was performed in 15 (1.3%) and its reconstruction in all but one (LRV group), where the LRV was occluded. Patients' glomerular filtration rates (GFRs) were retrospectively estimated through postoperative day 4 by using the Cockcroft-Gault equation and compared with the GFRs of 56 controls undergoing AAA repair without LRV division (control group) randomly identified from a prospectively compiled database in a 4:1 ratio. Post hoc 1:1 case-matched analysis was also performed. Statistical analyses were performed as appropriate.Comparison of demographics and risk factors revealed no statistically significant differences between the two groups with the exception of the following: AAAs were larger in LRV group (71.4 +/- 17.1 mm vs 56.0 +/- 14.6 mm P = .003) and preoperative GFR was lower in LRV group (65.3 +/- 19.0 mL/min/1.73 m(2) vs 82.8 +/- 22.3 mL/min/1.73 m(2)LRV division during AAA repair was associated with larger aneurysms and preoperative subclinical renal function impairment. In these patients, LRV reconstruction was associated with the maintenance of preoperative renal functional status without significantly lengthening of operative time or increasing the complications from surgery.
