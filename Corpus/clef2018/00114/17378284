Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm--a pilot study in six medical schemes. A pilot study to assess the feasibility and affordability of a targeted screening programme for abdominal aortic aneurysms in a group of employer-based medical schemes.Administrative database review and data extraction. Member enrolment by mail. Analysis using simple descriptive statistics. Review of international experience.Screening uptake and findings, type and cost of interventions recommended by providers.Database review identified 2187 age-eligible subjects (males between 60 and 65 years) who were advised to consult with their doctor/s if they had a history of smoking/and or cardiovascular disease. Two hundred and seven were referred for abdominal ultrasound screening, and aneurysms > or = 3.0 cm were found in 11 (5.3%). Only 1 subject had an aneurysm of sufficient size to justify early surgical intervention, and which resulted in the patient's death. Total cost of this pilot study approached R1 million. Analysis indicated that the sampling rate would have to be increased if such a programme were to be introduced as a routine medical benefit.International experience has been that screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms reduces morbidity and mortality but at a significant cost. Opinion of the researchers and trustees of the participating medical schemes was that this cost would be beyond the means of schemes at this time. Screening programmes, particularly those that increase health care costs in the early phases by identifying subjects for costly interventions, are unlikely to enjoy support as long as the health funding environment maintains its focus on short-term costs and benefits.
