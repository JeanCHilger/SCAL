Arterial wide-section anastomoses: experimental study on animals. A mechanical device for making arterial wide-section anastomoses was tested on a series of 15 laboratory rabbits. End-to-side anastomoses were made using a vein graft and they functioned in 93.1% of cases, as evidenced by intraoperative Doppler studies. When an anastomosis is made, the mean duration of temporary blood flow arrest in the rabbit aorta averaged 2 min. According to outcomes, the survived animals were divided into 3 groups: Group 1 comprised 2 (13.3%) rabbits that died within 10-12 hours after surgery and had significant symptoms of anastomotic dysfunction. Group 2 included 8 (53.3%) animals that died 2-3 days after surgery. They moved 5-6 hours following surgery without assistance, which was indicating of anastomotic functioning. Group 3 consisted of 3 (20%) rabbits that survived 2 weeks. Autoptic studies revealed no anastomic thrombosis in Group 2 animals. Group 3 animals were noted to have signs of allograft thrombosis and rejection. Thus, it is expedient to continue studies to make arterial wide-section anastomoses, by using the above device, in order to introduce this procedure into clinical practice.
