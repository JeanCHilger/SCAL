Chylous ascites following aneurysm surgery. A case of chylous ascites occurring after elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair is described. The patient was initially managed conservatively with hyperalimentation and intermittent drainage of the retroperitoneal collection, but, this proved inadequate and a peritoneo-venous shunt was inserted. Although the shunt appeared to work well the patient finally died of septicaemia.
