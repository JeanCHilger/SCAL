Thrombosis of atrioventricular prosthesis. Contribution of transesophageal echocardiography. The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic value of transesophageal echocardiography for the detection of thrombosis of a mechanical mitral or tricuspid valve prosthesis. Twelve patients (mean age 54 +/- 12 years) out of a series of 39 patients operated between April 1988 and June 1989 for prosthetic valve dysfunction had valve thrombosis at operation (11 mitral and 1 tricuspid valve prosthesis). Transesophageal echocardiography was routinely performed preoperatively in addition to transthoracic Doppler echocardiography to search for an abdominal mass on the prosthetic valves. The largest diameter of the diastolic jet at the level of the prosthetic valve annulus was measured using transesophageal color flow Doppler in the 8 Starr-Edwards mitral valve prostheses and compared with 5 control valves. The results of transthoracic Doppler echocardiography and transesophageal echocardiography were compared with the operative findings. The specificity of transthoracic echocardiography for the positive diagnosis of prosthetic valve thrombosis was 18%. A thrombosis could be suspected in 10 of the 12 cases by transthoracic echocardiography giving a sensitivity of 83%. Eleven of the 12 abnormal masses on the prostheses were visualised by transesophageal echocardiography, a sensitivity of 91%. Detection of the masses on the arterial side was possible in all cases (10/10) but 5 of the 6 extensions of the thrombus into the ventricle could not be visualised. The diameter of the transprosthetic jet was less than 12 mm in 7 of the 8 thrombosed valves compared with greater than 15 mm in the 5 normal control prostheses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
