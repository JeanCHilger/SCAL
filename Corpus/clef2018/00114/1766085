Infective endocarditis causing acute myocardial infarction by compression of the proximal left coronary artery due to a mycotic aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva. An extremely unusual case of myocardial infarction associated with infective endocarditis (IE) is described. A 38-year old male with a high fever was transferred to our hospital for further treatment of IE. Two-dimensional echocardiogram showed a large mycotic aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva in contact with neighbouring structures. The patient had a rapid recovery within several days after administration of antibiotic agents. However, he then developed abrupt onset of severe precordial pain. From the echocardiogram images and biochemical evaluation he was diagnosed as having an acute subendocardial infarction. Serial echocardiograms revealed expansion of the aneurysm, extending from the myocardium of the anterolateral free wall to the lower margin of the proximal left coronary artery. The cause of acute myocardial infarction was thought to be incomplete occlusion of the coronary artery through compression by the enlarging mycotic aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva. Urgent surgery confirmed compression of the left coronary artery by the large mycotic aneurysm as the cause of acute myocardial infarction.
