Neonatal haemangiomatosis in identical twins with twin-twin transfusion syndrome. Benign natal haemangiomatosis is characterised by the presence of multiple congenital haemangiomas restricted to the skin. It is differentiated from diffuse neonatal haemangiomatosis in which there is both cutaneous and visceral involvement, with higher morbidity and mortality.Two identical twins, I and II (monochorionic placenta, biamniotic), born prematurely at 30 weeks' amenorrhoea, presented twin-transfusion syndrome resulting in retarded intrauterine growth in twin I, the donor, and incipient anasarca in twin II, the recipient. Twin I weighed 960 g while twin II weighed 1 200 g. At birth, miliary haemangiomatosis was observed in both infants (16 haemangiomas in I, 19 in II). Abdominal ultrasound and whole-body MRI performed in the two children revealed multiple angiomatous hepatic nodular lesions in I. Subsequent routine clinical and ultrasound monitoring (hepatic and cardiac) showed increased size of the haemangiomatous lesions over the first 4 months followed by stabilisation and gradual regression. No systemic therapy was required. In twin I an episode of ulceration of a neck haemangioma occurred at 5 months and a favourable outcome was obtained on administration of topical hydrocolloid therapy.Twin-transfusion syndrome affects 15 to 30% of monochorionic biamniotic pregnancies. It is a serious complication of twin pregnancies resulting from a dynamic process of interfoetal blood transfusion as a result of venous-venous or arteriovenous vascular anastomoses. In the present case, which appears to be the first reported case, it seems that these monochorionic twins, who shared the same placenta, presented haemangiomatosis simultaneously in utero, if we accept the hypothesis of grafting of emboli of placental microvessels in the formation of congenital haemangiomas.
