Surveillance after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. (EVAR) Endovascular Aneurysm Repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms have mandated the need for surveillance imaging and other follow-up testing to minimize the complications of endograft failure and potential for abdominal aortic aneurysms rupture. The 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional contrast-enhanced computed tomography imaging currently serves as the gold standard for serial (EVAR) Endovascular Aneurysm Repair assessment, but this recommendation is being modified by successful clinical experience using duplex ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, and implantable wireless sac pressure sensors. Nearly all stent graft devices and abdominal aortic aneurysm-related complications after (EVAR) Endovascular Aneurysm Repair can be detected using available surveillance modalities assuming a compliant patient during follow-up. Alternating complementary surveillance techniques (contrast and noncontrast computed tomography, ultrasound, and pressure measures) can be used to reduce contrast dye and radiation exposure and can be tailored to patients with chronic renal insufficiency.
