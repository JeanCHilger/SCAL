Hepatic artery aneurysm. Aneurysms of the hepatic artery are relatively rare. Diagnosis often occurs only after rupture, and mortality is substantial. We report two new cases.The first patient was a 70-year-old woman whose asymptomatic aneurysm of the common hepatic artery was identified during ultrasound for vomiting and abdominal pain. Open aneurysm repair and a hepatosplenic bypass led to a favorable outcome. The second patient was a 54-year-old man his right hepatic artery aneurysm was diagnosed after it ruptured in the gall bladder.We review the literature about hepatic artery aneurysms and discuss the clinical features and methods for diagnosis and treatment of these uncommon lesions.
