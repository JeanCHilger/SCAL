Preoperative duplex scan assessment of the inferior epigastric artery as a coronary bypass conduit. The inferior epigastric arteries are currently being evaluated as alternative autologous arterial conduits for coronary artery bypass operations. The inferior epigastric arteries are variable in diameter and length and require harvesting through separate abdominal incisions. There is a need, therefore, for a method to preoperatively assess the diameter and length of the inferior epigastric arteries to determine their suitability as a coronary artery bypass graft. We have found that the duplex scan is a valuable noninvasive preoperative imaging modality to evaluate the inferior epigastric arteries.
