Use of transcranial Doppler ultrasound in endovascular repair of a type B aortic dissection. Intraprocedural monitoring with transcranial Doppler ultrasound in thoracic endovascular aortic repair provides critical information regarding the occurrence of cerebral microemboli and adequacy of cerebral blood flow. We present the perioperative course of a patient with complicated Stanford type B aortic dissection undergoing thoracic endovascular aortic repair with continuous intraoperative transcranial Doppler ultrasound monitoring.
