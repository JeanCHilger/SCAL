Rectal carcinoid tumor in a renal transplant patient. Malignancy represents a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with a long-term surviving graft. Carcinoid tumor is a common primary endocrine tumor in the general population that is rare in transplant recipients. Our present report focused on a 48-year-old man who received immunosuppressive therapy based on cyclosporine and steroids. Twelve years after renal transplantation, he suffered watery diarrhea and abdominal discomfort. Colonoscopy showed a hard, sessile mass at 5 cm from the anal verge endoscopic ultrasound showed a 13-mm homogenous hypoechoic mass. Upon endoscopic biopsy, the histological examination revealed a carcinoid tumor. Immunosuppresion was reduced and we performed endoscopic mucosal resection of the rectum. His clinical course has been good with no demonstrated recurrence.
