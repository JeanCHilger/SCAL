Mycotic aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva and complete atrioventricular block complicating infectious endocarditis with aortic regurgitation: a case report. A patient with a mycotic aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva and heart block secondary to infectious endocarditis was described. This 46-year-old man was admitted to our hospital on May 9, 1990, because of fever and progressive general malaise after extraction of a tooth. Physical examination on admission revealed blood pressure of 98/62 mmHg, pulse rate 96 per min, temperature 37.7 degrees C and respiration 35 per min. Auscultation of the heart revealed a grade 3/6 systolic murmur and a grade 2/6 diastolic murmur at the third left intercostal space. Chest radiograph showed mild cardiomegaly with moderate lung congestion. Electrocardiography revealed the first grade atrioventricular block. Echocardiography demonstrated vegetations on the aortic valve, and perforation of the non-coronary sinus of Valsalva. The prolapsed non-coronary sinus of Valsalva extended into the right atrium. Doppler echocardiography revealed a severe aortic regurgitant jet in the diastolic phase. We diagnosed the patient as having aortic regurgitation with a mycotic aneurysm of the non-coronary sinus of Valsalva due to infectious endocarditis. His condition remained severely ill despite intensive medical treatment. On May 14, 1990, aortic valve replacement and excision of the mycotic aneurysm were performed. The commissural portions of the aortic cusps were heavily thickened and calcified. The mycotic aneurysm was very fragile. During manipulating the mycotic aneurysm, the sinus accidentally perforated into the right atrium. The cardioaortic fistula was closed with a goretex patch. A demand pacemaker was implanted because of postoperative complete atrioventricular block.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
