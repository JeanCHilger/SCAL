Ureteral obstruction as a complication of reconstructive surgery on the aorta and ileal arteries. The results of surgical interventions in patients with ureteral obstruction after reconstruction of the abdominal part of the aorta and aortofemoral bifurcation bypass are analysed. Of 168 patients of the retrospective group ureteral obstruction after angiosurgery arose in 7 (4.2%) patients. Ureterolysis of the lumbar part of the ureter followed by peritonisation was made in 5 of them, ureterolysis and ureteral resection with ureteroureteroanastomosis end-to-end--in the rest patients. Two patients had relapse of the obstruction after ureterolysis. This was managed with ureteral endoprosthesis with nitilon stent. Treatment outcomes were good. No lethality was registered. Among patients of the prospective group moderate unilateral hydronephrosis was detected in 5 (4.8%) patients. They had no urinary complaints, hydroureteronephrosis was diagnosed in them at ultrasound examination. Surgical policy in early diagnosis of ureteral obstruction seems optimal as it restores urodynamics of the urinary tract and preserves function of the kidney.
