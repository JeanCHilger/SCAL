Echocardiographic diagnosis of secondary coarctation complicating the repair of a traumatic pseudoaneurysm of the aorta. An 18-year-old patient underwent repair of traumatic aortic pseudoaneurysm. Postoperatively, the physical examination showed hypertension with 30 mm Hg gradient between the upper and lower extremities. Doppler echocardiographic evaluation demonstrated a new (secondary) aortic coarctation at the site of the repair. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed the detailed anatomy and the cross-sectional area of the coarctation.
