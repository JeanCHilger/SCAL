Absolute quantification of regional renal blood flow in swine by dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging using a blood pool contrast agent. To evaluate for the first time in an animal model the possibility of absolute regional quantification of renal medullary and cortical perfusion by dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) using a blood pool contrast agent.A total of 18 adult female pigs (age, 16-22 weeks body weight, 45-65 kgIn 11 pigs, 4 different perfusion states were investigated sequentially. The reduced kidney perfusion measured by ultrasound highly correlated with total renal blood flow determined by DCE-MRI, P < 0.001. The correlation coefficient between both measurements was 0.843. Regional cortical and medullary renal flow was also highly correlated (r = 0.77/0.78, P < 0.001) with the degree of flow reduction. Perfusion values smaller than 50 mL/min/100 cm were overestimated by MRI, high perfusion values slightly underestimated.DCE-MRI using a blood pool contrast agent allows absolute quantification of total kidney perfusion as well as separate determination of cortical and medullary flow. The results show that our technique has sufficient accuracy and reproducibility to be transferred to the clinical setting.
