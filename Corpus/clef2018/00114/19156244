Repair of coarctation-related aortic arch aneurysm and ventricular septal defect in an adolescent. A saccular aortic arch aneurysm that is secondary to aortic arch coarctation and that is accompanied by a ventricular septal defect is a rare combination in the adolescent patient. Total simultaneous repair of all of these conditions is desirable, because of the higher morbidity and mortality rates of staged procedures-particularly when resection of the saccular aneurysm is delayed. Herein, we discuss the case of a 16-year-old boy who underwent simultaneous surgical correction of these malformations. With the aid of cardiopulmonary bypass on the beating heart, the coarctation and the aneurysmal segment were resected, and a tubular Dacron graft was interposed. The ascending aorta and femoral artery were both then cannulated to ensure whole-body perfusion during cardiopulmonary bypass. The ventricular septal defect was closed with the patient under cardioplegic arrest. After 10 days, he was discharged from the hospital without sequelae. We conclude that single-staged repair of cardiac abnormalities and of an aortic arch aneurysm that is secondary to coarctation of the aortic arch can be performed safely and effectively in adolescent and adult patients by use of our technique.
