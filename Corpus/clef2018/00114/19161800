A 37-year-old Smeloff-Cutter aortic valve. We describe the case of a 64-year-old woman with mitral insufficiency that had undergone an aortic valve replacement with a Smeloff-Cutoff prosthesis (Cutter Laboratories, Berkeley, CA) 37 years ago. She underwent both aortic and mitral valve replacement. The patient's Smeloff-Cutter aortic valve was unchanged. This case demonstrates the longest durability for the Smeloff-Cutter aortic prosthesis reported in the literature.
