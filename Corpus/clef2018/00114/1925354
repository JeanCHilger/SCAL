Acquired aneurysms of the infrarenal abdominal aorta. Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are the result of a degenerative process of the aortic wall. The incidence of AAA has increased during the last three decades. Computerized axial tomography is the best method for investigating AAA. For aneurysms of 4-5 cm or more in antero-posterior diameter, the risk of rupture is definitely high and justifies a preventive surgery. Precise evaluation of myocardial function and of coronary circulation may limit the operative risk and may improve the life expectancy. Screening of AAA in populations at risk will allow to survey the natural history of aneurysmal disease and limit the incidence of rupture which keeps a high mortality rate.
