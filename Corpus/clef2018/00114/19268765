The value of 3D-CT angiographic assessment prior to carotid stenting. Anatomic suitability for carotid artery stenting (CAS) is determined by arteriography, but this has a discrete stroke risk. We evaluated the use of multidetector CT angiography with three-dimensional reconstruction (3D-CTA) as a noninvasive screening tool for prospective CAS patients.Between 2003 and 2006, 90 CAS procedures were performed by vascular surgeons at our institution. At the discretion of the operating surgeon, 59 of the potential candidates for CAS underwent screening 3D-CTA of the aortic arch and carotid arteries. Results were used in patient selection and then analyzed retrospectively to determine clinical utility.Analysis of 3D-CTA data by the operating surgeon allowed stratification of patients into four groups: (1) appropriate for CAS via femoral approach (n = 37, 63%) (2) appropriate for CAS with transcervical access due to adverse arch anatomy (n = 2, 3%)In our initial experience, 3D-CTA reconstruction of the aortic arch and carotid arteries significantly influenced the plan for CAS in 37% of patients. Patients with clear anatomic contraindications to CAS can be excluded without the risks of arteriography. 3D-CTA further facilitates the CAS procedure by anticipating potential procedural. The cost-effectiveness and potential impact of this imaging modality on CAS outcomes deserve further study.
