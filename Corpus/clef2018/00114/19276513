Imaging of endoleaks after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) with contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). A pictorial comparison with CTA. Endoleaks following endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) are common and present a diagnostic challenge in the follow-up after EVAR. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) with low mechanical index (low MI) is a promising new method for the diagnosis and follow-up of endoleaks. CEUS with SonoVue allows a more rapid and noninvasive diagnosis, especially in critical patients owing to its bedside availability. This review describes the etiology, classification and importance of different types of endoleaks and compares CEUS findings with computed tomography angiography (CTA), allowing the reader to appreciate the usefulness of CEUS in this clinical situation.
