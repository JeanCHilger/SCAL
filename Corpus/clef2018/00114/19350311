Acute intestinal ischemia. Etiologically, therapeutically and prognostically, acute mesenteric ischemia is distinguished from chronic splanchnic ischemia. Acute mesenteric ischemia always is a case of emergency and associated with a 60-80% lethality. Difficult diagnosis, combined rapid progression of ischemic tissue loss and bacterial translocation are the main reasons for this depressing situation. Furthermore, obvious deficits in management and professional treatment are concomitant reasons. Only by intervening these factors prognosis of this deleting disease can be optimized.The main vessel, causing symptoms in 85%, is the superior mesenteric artery. Severe courses are characterized by abdominal rest pain and tissue lesions. In all symptomatic cases we see an indication for invasive treatment. CT-angiography with 3D-reconstruction is the diagnostic tool of choice. Today, conventional angiography only plays a role in combination with endovascular treatment (catheter-derived infusion therapy, lysis, PTA, stent). Duplex sonography should be performed, since this technique reveals relevant insight in hemodynamic severity of the lesion. However, diagnostic accuracy often is restricted due to air-filled bowels.
