Chronic intestinal ischemia. Ischemic lesions of the splanchnic organs are characterized by an insidious course and therefore are often underestimated. They can result in dramatic courses of disease which even in the last decade still results in a mortality of up to 90%. The reasons for this depressing situation are various but mainly due to insufficient consideration of the symptoms and late therapy due to delayed diagnosis.The incidence of chronic splanchnic ischemia is approximately 1-2% of all abdominal diseases. In contrast to acute intestinal ischemia the course is progressive, caused by progression of the underlying atherosclerosis and polymorbidity in this aging society. On the one hand occlusions of splanchnic arteries are diagnosed more often and on the other hand the incidence has increased due to the rising number of therapy-linked vascular catheter maneuvers. Due to excellent collateralization, diffuse stenotic processes can maintain asymptomatic for a long time. Duplex sonography should be performed as this technique reveals relevant insights into the hemodynamic severity of lesions.
