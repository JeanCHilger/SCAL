Endovascular management of takayasu arteritis: is it a durable option? Interim outcome of endovascular management of Takayasu arteritis (TA) was determined retrospectively to assess the efficacy of angioplasty and/or stenting in 24 patients with 35 lesions in the chronic inactive stage. The renal (n=16), subclavian/innominate (n=11), and carotid (n=5) arteries and abdominal aorta (n=3) were treated. Twenty-six lesions achieved excellent to good target lesion revascularization with no residual or only minimal residual stenosis, whereas five had a moderate result. Thirty lesions achieved satisfactory hemodynamic correction. Restenosis was observed in 8 lesions treated with angioplasty alone (n=18) and in 3 lesions treated with angioplasty and stenting (n=17). All recurrent stenoses underwent successful reintervention without significant complication. Treatment of inactive stage TA lesions with angioplasty alone or with angioplasty and stenting results in excellent to good clinical improvement in the majority of patients (follow-up at 46.8 months). Endovascular therapy is a durable treatment option in patients with chronic inactive stage TA.
