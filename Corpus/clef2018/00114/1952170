Transesophageal Doppler cardiac output monitoring: performance during aortic reconstructive surgery. Transesophageal Doppler (TED) monitoring provides continuous, noninvasive monitoring of cardiac output by measurement of aortic flow velocities. Because of the effects on aortic flow dynamics resulting from atherosclerosis, aortic cross-clamping, and wide variations in arterial blood pressure, the validity of TED monitoring during aortic surgery is unresolved. The authors prospectively evaluated a second-generation TED cardiac output monitor in 42 patients undergoing aortic reconstructive surgery. Four hundred eighty-nine simultaneous measurements of TED and thermodilution cardiac output were obtained. Transesophageal Doppler measurements were highly correlated to thermodilution measurements (R = 0.94) however, Bland-Altman analysis revealed a moderate error in the TED measurements (2 SD of the bias = 1.4 L/min). Trending analysis showed that TED monitoring accurately tracked changes in thermodilution cardiac output. Placement of an aortic cross-clamp resulted in significant reductions in the accuracy of Doppler measurements. Arterial blood pressure variations did not systematically affect the accuracy of the transesophageal technique. Limitations of TED monitoring, including a difficult calibration procedure, poor performance during aortic cross-clamping, and the need for probe repositioning, suggest further development is warranted.
