Beneficial effects of modern perfusion concepts in aortic valve and aortic root surgery. Minimized perfusion circuits (MPC) were found to reduce side effects of standard extracorporeal circulation (ECC). We evaluated the safety and efficacy of the ROCsafe MPC for aortic valve and aortic root surgery. One hundred and seventy patients were randomized for surgery using either MPC [n = 85, 30 female/55 male, mean age: 69.8 +/- 11.8 years aortic valve replacement (AVR): n = 40
