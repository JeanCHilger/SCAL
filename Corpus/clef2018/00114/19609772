Abdominal aortic aneurysm. Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) confer a substantial healthcare burden in the Western world. Surgical or endovascular therapy is indicated in patients with a maximum diameter exceeding 5.5 cm. Patients with smaller AAA must undergo a specific ultrasound surveillance program aimed at avoiding exposure to an increased risk of rupture once their AAA exceeds the threshold for active treatment. Based on improved understanding of the pathophysiology of AAA, recent years provided initial insight into potential medical treatment options. The presence of AAA is currently regarded a coronary artery disease risk equivalent. ACE inhibitors, statins and JNK-inhibitors were shown to have the potential to slow down progression. Since cigarette smoking is the main risk factor for both the development and progression of AAA, smoking cessation remains a key goal. Further prospective studies will assess the clinical efficacy of various promising drug treatment approaches aimed at slowing disease progression of small AAA and after endovascular therapy.
