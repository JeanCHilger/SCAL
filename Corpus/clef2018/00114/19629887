European Contegra multicentre study: 7-year results after 165 valved bovine jugular vein graft implantations. The valved bovine conduit "Contegra" for RVOT reconstruction became available for clinical use within a 100 % source data monitored and echo core lab controlled prospective European Multicentre Study, carried out from 1999 to 2006. We present the results of this study.A total of 165 Contegras were implanted in 8 centres. The mean patient age was 3.9 years (2 days - 18 years, median 2.0). Total follow-up was 687 patient years. Diagnoses included: tetralogy of Fallot (64 patients, 39 %), truncus arteriosus (50, 30 %), double outlet right ventricle (16, 10 %), aortic valve disease/Ross procedure (11, 7 %), pulmonary valve atresia (10, 6 %), transposition of the great arteries (10, 6 %), 4 other malformations (2 %). Previous procedures were: 82 patients (50 %) - none 37 (22 %) - valved conduit implantationThe 5-year freedom-from rates were: explantation - 90 % (for patients aged 1 to 10 years) and 68 % (for younger patients) endocarditis - over 92 %The performance of the Contegra conduit compares well with that of homografts when used to reconstruct paediatric right ventricular outflow tracts.
