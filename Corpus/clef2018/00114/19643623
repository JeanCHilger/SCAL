Delayed dislocation of a transapically implanted aortic bioprosthesis. Trans-apical aortic bioprosthesis implantation is currently evaluated as an alternative technique in high-risk patients. We report the case of a delayed upward displacement of a prosthesis after this procedure. It is hypothesised that the asymmetric calcification of the native valve and the presence of a mitral prosthesis caused the dislocation.
