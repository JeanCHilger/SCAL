Balloon expandable stents facilitate right renal artery reconstruction during complex open aortic aneurysm repair. Patients undergoing repair of thoracoabdominal (TAA) or visceral aortic segment aneurysms typically require reconstruction of the renal arteries. The use of balloon expandable stents (BES) has been proposed as an alternative to endarterectomy or bypass for renal artery reconstruction (RAR) during open aortic aneurysm repair. We report technical aspects and long-term patency data for this method of right RAR during complex open aortic aneurysm repair.During the interval July 1, 2005 to December 31, 2007, a total of 67 patients underwent right RAR using a BES during concomitant TAA (type I: n = 2 [2.9%], type II: n = 8 [11.9%], type III: n = 13 [19.4%], and type IV: n = 22 [32.8%]), juxtarenal (n = 9 [13.4%]) or suprarenal (n = 13 [19.4%]) AAA repair. Indications for RAR were orificial stenosis (n = 21 [31%]) and/or technical considerations referable to the proximal aortic suture line. Patency of the renal stent was evaluated in patients with computed tomography angiography using three-dimensional reconstruction or with abdominal duplex evaluation at follow-up.The mean patient age was 75.1 years, 54.4% were male, and 18% of operations were in nonelective circumstances. Twenty-seven (39%) out of 67 patients had a preoperative creatinine level > or = 1.4 mg/dL. Two patients (2.9%) developed permanent renal failure postoperatively (neither related to renal artery occlusion). Mean radiologic follow-up was 405 days (11-1281) with 98% stent patency noted. One patient had an early stent occlusion noted at 1 month. An additional patient was noted to have a nonflow-limiting dissection distal to the renal stent, and another was noted to have distal migration of the stent beyond the renal ostium however, these findings were clinically silent.The use of BES during complex open aortic aneurysm repair affords a rapid and durable mode of RAR, obviating the need for endarterectomy and its associated technical complications.
