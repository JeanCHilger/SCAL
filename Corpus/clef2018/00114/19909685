Nonoperative management of isolated celiac and superior mesenteric artery dissection: case report and review of the literature. Isolated dissection of the origin of both celiac and superior mesenteric arteries is a rare vascular pathology with limited management guidelines. The presentation is generally nonspecific, most often manifesting with epigastric pain radiating to the back. A high diagnostic index of suspicion and stepwise management are essential for a successful outcome. This case report details the clinical course of a 57-year-male who presented with a 2-week history of epigastric discomfort with back pain and was found to have focal celiac artery dissection with aneurysmal dilation of 1.2 cm. His vital signs were stable, and the physical examination was unremarkable. At this time, he was placed on antiplatelet medication and was scheduled for endovascular repair of his celiac aneurysm with a covered stent graft. Two weeks later, recurrent abdominal pain prompted a repeat computed tomographic scan that revealed sequential superior mesenteric artery (SMA) dissection. The patient was admitted and anticoagulated. A complete workup ruled out underlying collagen vascular and autoimmune pathology. He remained stable, with significant symptomatic improvement. After 6 months, anticoagulation was discontinued and antiplatelet therapy was instituted for long-term management. Subsequent operative or endovascular intervention was not required. The patient was continuing to do well on his 18-month clinical follow-up. There are 71 cases of SMA and 12 cases of celiac artery dissection in the literature. This report outlines this rare presentation of isolated, proximal sequential celiac artery and SMA dissection. This case illustrates that conservative management may be warranted in uncomplicated, isolated visceral arterial dissection.
