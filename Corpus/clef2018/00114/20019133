Evaluation of anatomic valve opening and leaflet morphology in aortic valve bioprosthesis by using multidetector CT: comparison with transthoracic echocardiography. To prospectively determine whether cardiac-gated multidetector computed tomography (CT) allows visualization of aortic valve leaflets after bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement (AVR), to provide an accurate method for measuring the aortic valve opening, and to provide morphologic and functional information regarding the mechanism underlying poor function of the bioprosthetic valve.The institutional review board approved the study protocol informed consent was given. Fifty-four patients (27 menAVA at CT correlated highly to EOA at TTE (r = 0.93, P < .001) but was significantly larger (1.2 cm(2) + or - 0.4 vs 1.1 cm(2) + or - 0.3, P < .001) than EOA at TTE. In dysfunctional bioprostheses (n = 34), CT results showed a variety of morphologic abnormalities, such as leaflet thickening (n = 9), presumed thrombotic material (n = 6), and leaflet calcification (n = 1). Multidetector CT results demonstrated restriction of leaflet motion indicated by lower OA (64 degrees + or - 5 vs 79 degrees + or - 3, P < .0001) in dysfunctional AVRs than in normally functioning AVRs (n = 11).Sixty-four-section CT can help accurately measure AVA in bioprosthetic AVR compared with EOA at TTE. It can also show morphologic abnormalities and reduced leaflet motion in a dysfunctional bioprosthesis, thereby potentially unraveling the mechanism of dysfunction.
