Midterm results from internal iliac artery branched endovascular stent grafts. To evaluate the midterm feasibility, efficacy and safety of internal iliac artery branch grafts for endovascular repair of aortoiliac, common iliac, and internal iliac artery aneurysms.Between December 2006 and September 2008, 8 patients underwent elective endovascular repair of aortoiliac, common iliac, and internal iliac artery aneurysms. Computed tomography aortography (CTA) was used to detect postoperative endoleak, stent migration, branch patency, and aneurysm sac expansion.All stent grafts were correctly implanted. However, intraoperative branch occlusion occurred in 2 of 8 cases. Both occlusions have been managed conservatively, with only 1 patient suffering detrimental symptoms. One endoleak was found. Median follow up by CT was 402 days (range 77 to 718 days). No patients died.Midterm results are encouraging for endovascular branch grafts to include the internal iliac artery. However, patient selection is of great importance and our series illustrates the value of caution and multidisciplinary teamwork.
