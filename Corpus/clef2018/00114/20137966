Long-term results after correction of persistent truncus arteriosus in 83 patients. This study aims to analyse long-term results after correction of truncus arteriosus in all patients operated in one institution over 28 years.Between 1981 and 2009, 83 patients, median age 54 days, underwent repair of truncus arteriosus. Interrupted aortic arch was present in 14 (17%), severe truncal valve insufficiency in 10 (12%) and non-confluent pulmonary arteries in five (6%) patients. Repair with reconstruction of the right ventricular to pulmonary artery continuity was performed using a valved conduit in 80, and other methods in three patients. At the same time, correction of interrupted aortic arch was done in 14 and truncal valve repair in eight patients. Survivors were repeatedly examined echocardiographically for assessment of residual heart lesions.The early mortality was 19 (23%). Out of 35 patients operated between 1981 and 1996, 17 (46%) died, and out of 48 patients operated between 1997 and 2009, two (4%) died. Operation before 1997 (p=0.001) and aortic cross-clamping time >90min (p=0.009) were found to be risk factors of death. Eight (10%) patients died late, a median of 68 days after surgery. Fifty-seven (69%) patients were followed for 10.9 + or - 6.7 years. Three (4%) patients were lost. Twenty-five (30%) patients are alive with their original conduit 7.5 + or - 5.2 years after correction. Twenty-eight patients required 41 re-operations for conduit dysfunction with first replacement at mean 5.8 + or - 4.1 (range 0.1-14.1 years) years after correction. Nine (11%) patients required 12 truncal valve replacements. Eleven (13%) patients required balloon dilatation or stent for conduit obstruction, pulmonary branch stenosis, aortic arch obstruction or stenosis of vena cava. Recent clinical examination was undertaken in 53 (64%) patients and 49 (59% or 77% of early survivors) are in good/very good condition.Truncus arteriosus remains a challenging heart disease. With growing experience, the early mortality decreased to 4%, but numerous re-interventions for conduit obstruction, pulmonary branch stenosis and truncal valve insufficiency are required. Surgery before 1997 and prolonged cross-clamping were risk factors of death. Pulmonary homografts had the best re-intervention-free survival. Statistically, however, the difference between conduits was not significant. Dysplastic valve and truncal valve insufficiency represent risk factors presenting the need for truncal valve replacement.
