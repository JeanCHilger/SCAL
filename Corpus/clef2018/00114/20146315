Bailout stenting for critical coarctation in premature/critical/complex/early recoarcted neonates. Surgical repair of critical coarctation can be problematic in premature, critical, complex, or early postoperative neonates.We aimed to review our experience with stent implantation to defer urgent surgery to an elective time.Fifteen neonates with severe aortic coarctation: five premature-hypotrophic (1,400-2,000 g), six critical and complex cardiac malformation, four early (1 day [0-2 days] median [range]) after surgical coarctectomy or complex arch reconstruction. Bare coronary stents (diameter 4.0 [3.5-5.0] mmAdequate aortic flow was obtained in 15 patients. The femoral artery was preserved in 13/15 patients. Two deaths occurred before stent removal and were nonprocedure related. In patients with simple stented coarctation, the stent was removed after 2.8 [0.2-5.0] months. In complex cardiac malformation, stents were finally removed 3.0 [0.2-78] months after implantation.simple coarctectomy end-to-end in eight, extensive arch patch reconstruction in four. One patient is awaiting stent removal. The final maximum systolic velocity (cw-Doppler) across the aortic arch was 1.7 [1.2-2.5] m/sec.In premature/critical/complex neonates with severe coarctation, bailout stenting followed by early or late surgical coarctectomy appears a promising concept.
