Succesful [Successful] endovascular repair of an abdominal mycotic aneurysm. A case report. A 73-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department presenting with cramping pain in the left iliac fossa that had persisted for ten days, with diarrhoea and dysuria. A recent onset of high fever had urged him to the hospital. A routine blood sample showed a leukocytosis of 11.9 x 10(3)/mm(3) and an elevated CRP of 16 mg/dl. Haemocultures and a urine sample were taken. A colonoscopy and ultrasound showed no abnormalities. The urine culture contained salmonella enteritidis. On day 5 a CT scan of the abdomen was performed. This showed a saccular aneurysm of the abdominal aorta, approximately 2 cm in length, with clear signs of a contained rupture. An urgent EVAR procedure was performed. An Excluder bifurcation-endoprosthesis was placed under antibiotic coverage. Control CT scan showed a thrombosis of the aneurysm and a type II endoleakage. The endoleakage spontaneously resolved within 3 months. The patient was kept on antibiotics (levofloxacine) for 4 months. We suggest that the use of an endoprosthesis could be a good and safe alternative for the repair of infrarenal mycotic aorta aneurysm.
