Chronic abdominal aortic graft infection : Detection with 18F-FDG-PET/CT. A 67-year-old male patient presented with recurrent fever and septic emboli due to an aorto-duodenal fistula after previous aortobiiliac bypass grafting with suspected graft infection. Imaging by ultrasound, computed tomography scan (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could not confirm graft infection. A scan using 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-[18F]-d-glucose positron emission tomography CT (18F-FDG-PET/CT) revealed a pathological uptake. The bifurcated graft was removed und revascularization was performed by axillobifemoral bypass grafting. The clinical role of CT scanning with 18F-FDG-PET/CT is discussed including a review of the recent literature.
