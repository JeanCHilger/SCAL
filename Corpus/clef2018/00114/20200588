Bilateral iliopsoas hematomas under sedation: a complication of postoperative therapy after coronary artery bypass grafting. We report a case of bilateral iliopsoas hematomas that occurred during postoperative therapy after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). An 81-year-old woman receiving anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapies under sedation after CABG developed sudden anemia and went into shock. Abdominal ultrasonography showed a right retroperitoneal hematoma. She improved gradually with conservative treatment. Many patients with an iliopsoas hematoma complain of low-abdominal pain or femoral neuropathy, but such local signs may be absent under sedation. In anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapies under sedation, when the cause of anemia and shock is not clear, we should suspect peritoneal hematoma and examine the peritoneal space.
