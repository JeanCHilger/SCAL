Valve-sparing aortic root replacement and tricuspidization in a patient with an asymmetric bicuspid aortic valve. Aortic valve replacement is the standard surgical procedure for severe aortic regurgitation. Due to advances over the past decade, there have been substantial improvements in aortic root graft design, in aortic valve repair techniques, and in the understanding of valvular function in the remodeled aortic root. Herein, we describe the case of a dyspneic patient with an asymmetric bicuspid aortic valve who underwent valve-sparing aortic root replacement and tricuspidization. The patient subsequently resumed strenuous physical activity and was asymptomatic 2 years after the operation.
