Risk of reintervention after endovascular aortic aneurysm repair. The role of symptomatic presentation in directing reintervention after endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) was investigated.All patients undergoing infrarenal EVAR between 2001 and 2009 were studied. Those needing reintervention were divided into symptomatic and asymptomatic presentations. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to calculate freedom from reintervention, and log rank tests for subgroup analyses. Multivariable analysis identified risk factors for reintervention.The study included 553 patients with a mean(s.d.) age of 75(7) years and aneurysm diameter of 65(13) mm. The 30-day mortality rate was 2.5 per cent. Median follow-up was 31 (range 1-97) months. There were 86 reinterventions in 69 (12.5 per cent) of 553 patients 41 presented with symptoms and 28 were asymptomatic. Reintervention-free survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 years were 90.1, 85.3 and 81.2 per cent. The reintervention rate was higher in patients who needed an intraoperative adjunct during the index procedure (P = 0.014) and in those who did not have intraoperative computed tomography angiography (P = 0.024). Intraoperative adjuncts were an independent risk factor for future reintervention (hazard ratio 2.62, 95 per cent confidence interval 1.18 to 3.76Most patients requiring reintervention presented symptomatically. A high-risk subgroup may be identifiable to rationalize a postoperative surveillance programme.
