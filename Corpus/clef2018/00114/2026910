The effect of PGI2 and SOD on the reimplantation response after lung transplantation. In order to improve the early postoperative pulmonary dysfunction caused by the reimplantation response after single lung transplantation, prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were administered to dogs whose left lungs were subjected to complete hilar-stripping and then exposed to warm ischemia, or resected and replaced with allograft. Doppler flow probes were placed on the ascending aorta and on the left main pulmonary artery, and a Swan-Ganz catheter was introduced into the pulmonary trunk. Twenty five dogs were divided into 4 groups. Hilar stripping of the left lung with division and reanastomosis of the left main bronchus was performed in 7 dogs (Group 1). Hilar stripping of the left lung with division and reanastomosis of the left main bronchus was exposed to additional warm ischemia for one hour in 6 dogs (Group 2). Same surgical procedure as Group 2 with additional treatment by using PGI2 (1 micrograms/min/kg for 30 min). and SOD (20 mg/kg) was performed in 6 dogs (Group 3). Single lung transplantation with PGI2, SOD and immunosuppressive treatment (CyA 10 mg/kg and AZ 4 mg/kg daily for 2 weeks) was performed in 6 dogs (Group 4). The pulmonary arterial blood flow of the left lung and the cardiac output were serially measured by means of Doppler flow method for two weeks for studying the graft function in the early postoperative period. Findings of chest X-ray films and arterial blood gases were also studied for two weeks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
