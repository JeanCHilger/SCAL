Hemodynamic performance of mitroflow aortic pericardial bioprosthesis - optimizing management for the small aortic annulus. Documentation of the hemodynamics of the Mitroflow aortic pericardial bioprosthesis has been incomplete. The aim of the study was to provide reference effective orifice areas for the implant calculation of effective orifice area indexes to avoid prosthesis-patient mismatch.Echocardiograms were evaluated in 55 patients (39 females, 16 males), mean age 77.0 +/- 6.9 years (range 51-90 years). The mean time of the studies was 11.0 months. The prosthesis sizes and numbers evaluated were 19 mm (n = 13), 21 mm (n = 19), 23 mm (n = 13) and 25 mm (n = 10).Peak aortic velocities averaged from 2.2 to 2.7 m/sec, mean gradients from 10.6 to 15.1 mmHg, peak gradients from 20.7 to 29.7 mmHg, and effective orifice area (EOA) from 1.4 to 1.8 cm (2). When accounting for the subaortic velocity, mean gradients averaged from 7.5 to 10.0 mmHg, and peak gradients averaged 15.1 to 23.5 mmHg. The effective orifice area indexes ranged from 0.8 to 1.0 cm (2)/m (2). The mean postoperative left ventricular mass index was 101.6 gm/m (2).The IN VIVO effective orifice areas by valve size of the Mitroflow aortic pericardial bioprosthesis provide the opportunity of avoiding obstructive characteristics for all valve sizes, including optimizing the management of the small aortic annulus.
