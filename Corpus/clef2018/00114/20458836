A rare case of aortic bioprosthesis thrombosis. Chronic thrombosis of the Carpentier-Edwards SAV porcine aortic bioprosthesis is a very rare complication.We present the case of an 80-year-old male patient with dyspnoea NYHA class III 30 months after coronary artery bypass grafting and aortic valve replacement. Echocardiography showed an increased gradient over the bioprosthesis and blockage of the right coronary leaflet. Reoperation revealed a large thrombotic deposition on the right and non-coronary leaflets. To the best of our knowledge this is only the second case reported in the literature.
