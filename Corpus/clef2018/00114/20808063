A case of Candida parapsilosis fungal balls in the urinary tract associated with a retrocaval ureter. A 70-year-old man with a medical history of diabetes mellitus presented to a local clinic with seven days history of right flank pain and fever. Because there was no symptomatic improvement after one-week antibiotic administration, abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomographic scans were performed to show mass lesions in the right hydropelvis, and he was transferred to our hospital. Retrograde pyelography revealed a retrocaval ureter and a ureteral stent was indwelt. After the symptoms improved, the lesions were removed by percutaneous nephrostomy and fungal balls were diagnosed as Candida parapsilosis after culture. After intermittent one-week irrigation of the renal pelvis with normal saline, the nephrostomy tube was removed. In six-month follow-up, mild hydronephrosis remains without fungal ball recurrence. To the best our knowledge, there has been no case report of Candida parapsilosis fungal balls in the urinary tract.
