Total laparoscopic renal artery bypass for restenosis after failed percutaneous transluminal renal stenting. The purpose of this article was to report our experience of the repair of renal artery restenosis after percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) using a total laparoscopic technique without robotic assistance.Between February 2005 and October 2009, we performed six total laparoscopic aortorenal artery bypasses for restenosis after failed PTRA. All these patients had recurrent hypertension with renal insufficiency.The mean operative time was 246 minutes (range, 200-310 minutes). The mean warm renal ischemic time was 28 minutes (range, 22-35 minutes). All patients received a prosthetic graft interposition. The estimated surgical blood loss was 980 mL (range, 500-1400 mL). No conversion was observed and no in-hospital deaths occurred. There was no severe postoperative morbidity. Postoperative serum creatinine levels raised in all patients but all returned to baseline before discharge. Median length of postoperative hospital stay was 6 days (range, 4-8 days). Median follow-up was 13 months (range, 7-19 months). Color Doppler ultrasound scan examination and computed tomography (CT) with injection of contrast media showed patency of all bypasses. Hypertension was improved in all patients but renal insufficiency remained unchanged.Total laparoscopic renal artery bypass is feasible and safe in patients after failed PTRA. This approach may reduce the morbidity of open repair but is technically demanding and necessitates a large previous experience in total laparoscopic aortic surgery.
