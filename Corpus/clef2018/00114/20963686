Ultrasound for surveillance after endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm--simple and safe?. In the past, multislice computed tomography angiography (CTA) with arterial and venous phase was recommended as the gold standard in follow-up after endovascular abdominal aneurysm repair (EVAR). Iodine-containing contrast agents and frequent radiation exposure are limitations for use in elderly patients with chronic renal insufficiency. Colour-coded Doppler sonography (CCDS) and, especially, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) are non-invasive methods that are time and cost effective. Both provide a reliable alternative to CTA in surveillance after EVAR. CEUS seems to be superior in characterisation of the type of endoleaks and can be established in order to reduce iodine-containing contrast agent and radiation exposure in follow-up. In contrast to CTA scans, CEUS can be offered to patients with chronic renal insufficiency and allows a dynamic examination and perfusion analysis (e. g., in fenestrated and branched stentgrafts). Routine combination with X-ray allows control of stentgraft material and location of the branches.
