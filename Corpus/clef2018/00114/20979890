Early and mid-term results of endovascular aneurysm repair for infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) has become a viable alternative to open surgical repair in the last decade. We report here our experience on the mid-term results of EVAR and analysis of the outcomes associated with endograft AAA repair.Between Nov 2002 and Mar 2007, 26 patients with AAA were enrolled in a single institution. Indications for EVAR included unfavorable condition of body (eg. Heart, lung, or renal dysfunction, etc) for open surgery and maximum diameter of AAA > 5.0 cm. Customized stent-grafts were Talent TM, Zenith and some of products made in China. All of the patients were followed up with ultrasonography or computed tomography angiography every 3 months first year after EVAR and every year after.The mean (SD) follow-up was 38.8 Â± 12.7 months (median, 35.0 months range, 24 to 64 months), and no patients were lost to follow-up. All cause mortality was 15.4% (4/26), with all deaths occurring within the first 2 postoperative yearThe mid-term results of EVAR support the continued use in patients with contraindications for traditional open surgery of AAA. Close surveillance is mandatory for endoleak, especially for type I endoleak. Some proximal neck dilation can be caused by the stent-graft expansion, injury, and aortic pathological changes. Endoleak of type II can not lead to enlargement of aneurysm sac probably.
