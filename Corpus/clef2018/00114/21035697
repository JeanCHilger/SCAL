Inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm endovascular repair into the long-term follow-up. To investigate long-term outcomes for inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms (IAAA) after endovascular treatment (EVAR).Between May 1997 and January 2009, 9 male patients (Mean 67 years, range 54-75 years) with IAAA were treated with EVAR using commercially available endografts. Results were assessed using contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) at 3 months, 12 months, and biannually thereafter. Echo-color duplex scanning was also recommended at 3, 6, and 12 months after discharge, and annually thereafter. Primary endpoints were aneurysm-related mortality, aneurysm sac evolution, perianeurysmal fibrosis (PAF) thickness, and hydronephrosis progression.No aneurysm-related deaths were observed during the long-term follow-up of eight patients (one patient death unknown). Maximum aneurysm sac diameter progressively reduced in eight patients (89%) and remained unchanged in one (11%). The absolute mean reduction of the aneurysm size was 26.2%. PAF regressed in two patients (22%), reduced in five (56%), and remained unchanged in two (22%). The absolute median reduction of the PAF thickness was 55.1%. No endoleak was observed during the follow-up period. Hydronephrosis persisted in all three patients who were preoperatively diagnosed with this pathology. Survival rates were 89%, 66.7%, and 66.7% at 12, 36, and 60 months, respectively.This series suggests that EVAR for IAAA into the long-term is associated with a positive trend for both PAF and aneurysm diameter reduction. EVAR does not seem to offer any benefits for hydronephrosis, but seems to effectively exclude the aneurysm sac in anatomically suitable patients.
