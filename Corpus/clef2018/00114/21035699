Open surgical repair and endovascular treatment in adult coarctation of the aorta. The aim of this study was to compare the results of endovascular therapy (covered stenting) with surgical technique to repair aortic coarctation in adults.A prospective study of 11 patients who were treated during the past 10 years was carried out. Of these, five patients underwent endoprosthesis (group A) and six an open surgical repair (group B). Follow-up comprised monitoring of the blood pressure, echocardiography, and computed tomography and magnetic resonance angiographic studies.The mean age of the patients was 46 years (range: 17-67 years) and the mean follow-up was 52.6 months (range: 1-117 months 32.3 for group A vs. 69.7 for group BShort- and medium-term results of the endovascular therapy are similar, with shorter stay in the intensive care unit and higher necessity of antihypertensive treatment. Echocardiography and Doppler aortic coarctation gradients slightly higher than 20 mm Hg are usual during follow-up.
