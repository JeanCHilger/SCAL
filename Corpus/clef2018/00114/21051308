Massive aortic thrombus in patient with mechanical prosthetic valve supported with left ventricular assist device. A 54-year-old left ventricular assist device (LVAD)-supported patient with mechanical prosthetic valves was planned for LVAD exchange using cardiac computed tomography(CCT) for preoperative evaluation. The CCT revealed massive thrombus in the ascending aorta. The surgery was done without thromboembolic complications. We reinforces the utility of CCT as a preoperative assessment in this specific case.
