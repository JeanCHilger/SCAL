Soluble TWEAK plasma levels predict expansion of human abdominal aortic aneurysms. Diminished soluble tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (sTWEAK) concentrations are associated with cardiovascular diseases. We have analyzed sTWEAK levels and its relation with expansion rate in subjects with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).sTWEAK levels were measured by ELISA.sTWEAK concentrations were diminished in small AAA (≤ 5 cm 353 ± 12 pg/mLsTWEAK plasma levels were decreased in subjects with AAA and were independently related with AAA expansion rate indicating that this protein could be a novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of AAA.
