Acute thrombosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm: three case reports. Presented herein are three clinical case reports concerning patients with acute thrombosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. In all three instances, the true cause of the acute limb ischaemia syndrome had been recognized not immediately at admission but only after instrumental examination or during laparotomy. The mechanisms of the development of acute thrombosis of the aneurysmatic sac in all three cases turned out to be different. Two patients endured direct reconstruction of the abdominal aorta, and the remaining one sustained extra-anatomical bypass grafting. Of these, two patients survived, and one patient subjected to aortofemoral bypass grafting unfortunately died of renal failure on postoperative day 3.
