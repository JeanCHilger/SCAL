The value of intravascular phased-array imaging in endovascular treatment of thoracic aortic pathology. Careful pre-, intra- and postoperative diagnostics in endovascular treatment of thoracic aortic pathology is crucial for a favourable outcome. Computer tomography (CT) and digitally subtracted angiography (DSA) do not always provide sufficient diagnostic information.To report our primary experiences of using intraluminal phased-array imaging (IPAI) as an additive tool for diagnostics and endovascular treatment of thoracic aortic pathology.Eleven patients, nine men and two women (mean age 60, range 45) were examined intraoperatively with IPAI in stentgraft procedures of thoracic aortic pathology.IPAI could detect and visualize the entries and re-entries in the intima. Aortic branch vessels could be visualized for patency both during and immediately after stentgraft deployment. It was also possible to detect ceased blood flow in the false lumen or aneurysmal sac after stentgraft deployment.IPAI is a helpful tool for diagnostics and for guiding stentgraft placing in the treatment of thoracic aortic pathology.
