The combined treatment of aortic stenosis and abdominal aortic aneurysm using transcatheter techniques: a case report. We describe the case of an 85 year old lady with symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) with a history of previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), who was referred for consideration of aortic valve replacement (AVR). Echocardiography revealed severe AS with peak gradient of 92 mmHg, orifice area of 0.6 cm2 and preserved left ventricular function. Computed tomography (CT) aortogram revealed a diffusely calcified aorta and an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) measuring 6.5 cm. For symptomatic and prognostic reasons she needed treatment of both the AAA and AS. Her calculated logistic EuroSCORE for AVR was 39%. Following discussion at a multidisciplinary forum, it was agreed that the best way to offer her treatment with the lowest risk was by using transcatheter techniques for both pathologies. She subsequently underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) via the transapical approach to treat her AS, and 3 months later, endovascular stenting of her infrarenal AAA. She recovered well from both procedures. At 6 week follow up, her cardiac symptoms had improved considerably, and echocardiography revealed a mean AV gradient of 7 mmHg with good left ventricular function. Ultrasound of her abdomen revealed exclusion of the aneurysm sac with no endoleak. This is the first described case of TAVI and endovascular treatment of an AAA as a staged procedure.
