Surgical treatment of chronic abdominal ischemia. The study includes data of 139 patients with chronic abdominal ischemia, due to hemodynamically significant occlusion of impaired visceral aortic branches. The diagnosis was confirmed by aortography, computed tomoangiography and duplex color angioscanning. Immediate and long-term results of 49 reconstructive and conditionally reconstructive operations, 11 transcutaneous endovascular angioplasty, as well as postoperative complications, were analyzed.
