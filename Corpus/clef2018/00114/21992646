Percutaneous superficial temporal artery access for carotid artery stenting in patients with a hostile aortic arch. To describe an entirely percutaneous treatment for carotid artery stenting in a type IIa aortic arch via the superficial temporal artery (STA) for through-and-through guidewire access.The technique is demonstrated in an 83-year-old man status post left carotid endarterectomy 3 months prior who presented with 2.5 hours of confusion and dysphasia following diagnostic carotid arteriography. The patient was known to have a type IIa bovine aortic arch and a severe 70% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery. The patient was referred for carotid artery stenting by his vascular surgeon. Due to the bovine arch, a percutaneous ultrasound-guided approach via the STA for through-and-through wire access facilitated carotid artery stenting from the right common femoral artery. The procedure was successful, and follow-up duplex ultrasound confirmed patency of the STA the next day.A percutaneous ultrasound-guided STA access can help facilitate transfemoral carotid artery stenting in an otherwise difficult type IIa aortic arch setting.
