Endovascular stent placement for the treatment of nutcracker syndrome. A patient presented with recurrent macroscopic hematuria, persistent orthostatic proteinuria and intermittent flank pain for 12 months. Doppler ultrasound, computed tomography angiography and selective renal vein phlebography revealed the compression of the left renal vein by the abdominal aorta. The patient was diagnosed with nutcracker syndrome and underwent endovascular stent placement. No intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred. The clinical symptoms completely resolved 14 days after the operation. At a follow-up of 6 months, the patient continued to be asymptomatic.
