Development of a growing rat model for the in vivo assessment of engineered aortic conduits. Numerous limitations of aortic valve grafts currently used in pediatric patients cause the need for alternative prostheses. For the purpose of in vivo evaluation of novel engineered aortic conduit grafts, we aimed at downsizing a previously described model to create a growing rodent model.U-shaped aortic conduits were sutured to the infrarenal aorta of young Wistar rats (70-80 g, n = 10) in an end-to-side manner. Functional assessment was performed by Doppler sonography and high resolution rodent MRI. Histology and immunohistochemistry followed after 8 wk.Postoperative recovery rate was 80%. Conforming to clinical observations, postoperative MRI (d 5) and Doppler sonography (wk 8) revealed unimpaired conduit perfusion. Explanted implants were luminally completely covered by an endothelial cell layer with local hyperplasia and accumulation of Î±-smooth muscle actin (+) cells. Moreover microcalcification of the decellularized scaffolds was observed.Our downsized model of aortic conduit transplantation enables overall characterization with detailed analysis of maturation of engineered aortic grafts in a growing organism.
