Correlation of CT aortography measurements of infrarenal aortic aneurysms and body mass index in preprocedural evaluation for endovascular repair. The aim of this study is to analyze the morphological differences of infrarenal aortic aneurysms and common iliac arteries that are important for endovascular management between patients of different body mass index using 64 slice multidetector row CT aortography. This was a multicenter study of 100 patients (50 Europeans and 50 Japanese). All patients had risk factors, manifest symptoms, and ultrasound verified aneurysmal dilation of the infrarenal aorta. All examinations were performed on the same CT platform using the same post-processing protocols. Due to the heterogeneity of the population, several statistical models were used. Significant differences were found in morphological parameters of infrarenal aorta in relation to BMI. In over one out of three patients with BMI less than 23, endovascular treatment is contraindicated due to the dimensions of the aneurysmal neck. Relative to BMI value, differences were found in transverse diameters of the medium part of the aneurysm and in the length of common iliac arteries. CT aortography performed on a 64 slice multidetector row CT platform provides precise and numerous data for the analysis of anatomical and pathological differences of infrarenal aortic aneurysms that are of crucial importance for the planning of treatment and the analysis of the differences relating to body habitus.
