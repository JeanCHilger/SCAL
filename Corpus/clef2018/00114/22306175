Technical note and results in the management of anatomical variants of renal vascularisation during endovascular aneurysm repair. The revascularisation of large (>3Â mm) renal arteries emerging from the proximal sealing zone or off the aneurismal wall can be challenging during endovascular aortic aneurysm repair. In this article, we describe various endovascular techniques using custom-made endografts to treat these complex variant anatomies.Nine patients deemed unfit for open repair with unusual renal vascularisation associated with aortic aneurysms were treated by endovascular means. After three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions on a dedicated workstation, custom-made devices were designed and manufactured. The revascularisation of multiple renal arteries and aberrant origins of renal arteries, associated or not with pelvic kidney or horseshoe kidney, was managed using fenestrated and branched endografts.All target vessels were patent on computed tomography (CT) scan and contrast-enhanced ultrasound evaluation before discharge as well as on the 6-month follow-up. One patient presented a decrease of postoperative glomerular filtration rate over 30% but did not require dialysis. No sac enlargement was depicted, and no reintervention was performed during follow-up. Three type 2 endoleaks were diagnosed.Endovascular treatment with fenestrated and branched endografts should be considered in challenging renal artery anatomies in patients unfit for open repair.
