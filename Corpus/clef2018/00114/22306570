The effects of implanted valve sizes on ventricular hypertrophy in aortic stenosis. We aimed to study the effects of the valve sizes according to body surface area on aortic gradient and ventricular hypertrophy in the cases of aortic valve replacement due to isolated aortic stenosis.Between January 2006 and April 2007, patients (12 men, 15 women totally 27) followed up prospectively with echocardiography fourth and sixth month postoperatively. The patients were divided into two groups according to the prosthetic aortic valve diameters (19-21 mm vs 23-25 mm). The primary endpoints between the two groups (aortic regurgitation, left ventricular mass index and transvalvular gradient measured by color and continuous wave Doppler) were compared. Fischer exact test and Mann-Whitney U test were used for intergroup comparison whereas intragroup analysis was done with Freidman test.Mean systolic gradient and left ventricular mass index were significantly reduced in 23 mm and 25 mm valves (p<0.01) in the postoperative follow-up. In addition, especially, decline in the values of left ventricular mass, left ventricular mass index, peak systolic gradient and the mean systolic gradient were found to be significant. These values associated with regression were detectable at the postoperative 4th month, but actual significant regression was observed at the postoperative 6th month (p<0.01). On the other hand, the values obtained for 19 mm and 21 mm valves also showed significant progress (p<0.05).Factors such as age, gender and activity are important in the selection of appropriate valve sizes in aortic valve replacement. However, the patient's body surface is the most important prognostic factor compared to others.
