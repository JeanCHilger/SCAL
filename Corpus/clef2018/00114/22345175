Early and mid-term outcomes in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation after previous coronary artery bypass grafting. Surgical aortic valve replacement in patients with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) carries a high mortality. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has been shown to be successful in high risk subgroups of patients. Our goal is therefore to evaluate the impact of a history of CABG on the outcome of patients who undergo TAVI.From October 2006 to June 2010, among the 201 patients selected to undergo TAVI, 54 (27%) had a history of CABG. Outcomes were prospectively collected.The 30-day outcome was not different between patients with previous CABG vs. those without, in particular as regards mortality (respectively, 5.6% vs. 10.9% P = 0.25). Mid-term survival (mean FU: 7 ± 9 months) was not different at 2 years between patients with previous CABG vs. patients without (65.7 ± 6.2% vs. 80.0 ± 7.7% respectivelyPrevious CABG does not adversely affect outcome in patients undergoing TAVI. If confirmed by larger prospective series and ideally by a randomized trial comparing CABG vs. redo surgery, this observation might lead the heart team to consider TAVI as an attractive option in the population of high risk patients with aortic stenosis and previous CABG.
