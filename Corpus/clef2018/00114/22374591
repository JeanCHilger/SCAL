Ascending aorta cannulation in stanford type a acute aortic dissection. Establishment of cardiopulmonary bypass for Stanford type A acute aortic dissection( type A AAD) should be quick and safe. The femoral artery, axillary artery, ascending aorta, and left ventricular apex are potential access points for cannulation. The most important reason for establishing cardiopulmonary bypass for type A AAD is to allow antegrade blood flow through the true lumen. Starting in 2007, Jakob et al, and Inoue et al. applied the technique of ascending aortic cannulation for type A AAD. From 2008, we applied this method of ascending aorta cannulation in 8 patients and compared preoperative, operative, and postoperative data with a control group, or the femoral artery cannulation group. Ascending aorta cannulation was done safely and easily with the use of the Seldinger technique under epiaortic color Doppler echography and  transesophageal echography. No cerebral events or hypoperfusion-based complications occurred in the group of ascending aorta cannulation. Given that no cases of complication occurred using this method, it could be considered as an effective choice of cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass.
