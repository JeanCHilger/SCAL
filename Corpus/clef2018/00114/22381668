Spontaneous neonatal arterial thrombosis: a report of 4 neonates. Arterial thromboses are rare in newborns, mostly caused by arterial catheters. Neonatal arterial thrombosis occurring in other contexts is much rare. We report arterial thrombosis, not caused by catheterisation in 4 neonates hospitalised in the neonatology department of the Farhat Hached de Sousse hospital in Tunisia. The diagnosis of arterial thrombosis was made based on signs of ischemia in 2 patients affected by thrombosis of the iliac arteries. The symptoms were less clear: anuria associated with arterial high blood pressure in 1 patient affected by thrombosis of the abdominal aorta and by anuria with melena in a newborn with aortic and mesenteric thrombosis. Diagnosis was confirmed by Doppler sonography in 3 patients and based on autopsy data in 1 patient. A delay to consultation was noted in 3 patients, whose outcome was fatal. The progression was favourable after thrombolysis and anticoagulation using heparin in 1 patient with major aortic thrombosis. A review of the literature on the epidemiological, clinical, therapeutic and outcome data of the arterial thrombosis in the newborn child is provided.
