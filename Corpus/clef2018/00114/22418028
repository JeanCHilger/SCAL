Endothelial adhesion of targeted microbubbles in both small and great vessels using ultrasound radiation force. The effectiveness of microbubble-mediated ultrasound molecular imaging and drug delivery has been significantly affected by the axial laminar flow of vessels which prevents ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) from targeting vascular endothelium. Studies show that acoustic manipulation could increase targeted UCA adhesion in microcirculation and some small vessels. In this study we demonstrate that ultrasound radiation force (USRF) can also significantly enhance the targeted adhesion of microbubbles in both small and great vessels. Our results indicate that the UCA adhesion targeted to ICAM-1 expressed on mouse cremaster microvascular endothelial cells increase about 9-fold when USRF is applied at 1 MHz and 73.9 kPa. The adhesion of anti-CD34 microbubbles to the endothelia of rat abdominal aorta was visually analyzed using scanning electron microscopy for the first time and thousands of microbubbles were found attached to the aortic endothelia after USRF application at the same acoustic parameters. Our data illustrate that targeted adhesion of anti-CD34 microbubbles is possible in normal abdominal aorta and we demonstrate the potential of using USRF in molecular imaging of a vascular target.
