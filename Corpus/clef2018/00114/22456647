Early and mid-term results of total laparoscopic bypass for aortoiliac occlusive lesions. The aim of this study was to investigate the early and mid term results of total laparoscopic bypass for aortoiliac occlusive lesions.From December 2001 to January 2007, we performed 32 laparoscopic bypasses for aortoiliac lesions. The mean age was 52.9 years. Clinical stages included: severe intermittent claudication (N.=24) ischemic rest pain (N.=5) and tissue loss or gangrene (N.=3). According to the TASC classification, the lesions were type B in three cases, C in nine cases and D in 20 cases. Graft patency was controlled by means of duplex scan before discharge and during the follow-up. The patency rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis.In 27 out of 32 patients the total laparoscopic bypass was successful (84%). Conversion was necessary in five patients. The mean operative time was 338 minutes (range, 200-620 minutes), the mean aortic clamping time was 73 minutes (range, 35-144 minutes). Mortality was 0%. The postoperative course was uneventful in 19 patients (70%). The mean follow-up was 32.1 months. In this period we had two deaths, one from breast cancer after 12 months. The second patient has committed suicide after 48 months. Two graft occlusions occurred at 3 and 21 months. No other late complications were observed. The primary and secondary graft patency rate was estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis at 92% and 96% on the first year and 87% and 93% at three years, respectively.Early and mid-term results of total laparoscopic bypass are good in selected patients and comparable to these of conventional surgery.
