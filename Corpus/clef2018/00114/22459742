Statin therapy is associated with aneurysm sac regression after endovascular aortic repair. Several anatomic factors have been identified as predictive of sac behavior after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). The effects of statin therapy on aneurysm sac size reduction remain controversial. This study tested the hypothesis that statin therapy enhances aneurysmal sac regression after EVAR.This monocentric retrospective study included patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms treated by EVAR using the Zenith (Cook, Bloomington, Ind) graft device. We excluded patients presenting with perioperative sac enlargement factors such as endoleaks, endotension, infectious, inflammatory, ruptured, or anastomotic aneurysms. We prospectively assessed standard clinical and anatomic data, as well as statin use, at the time of EVAR and during follow-up. The primary end point was the decrease in the largest transverse aortic diameter at 24 months compared with the preoperative diameter.Among 166 patients treated by a Zenith device and meeting the inclusion criteria, 120 were identified as statin users and 46 as nonstatin users, with comparable characteristics. At 24 months of follow-up, statin group patients had a greater aneurysm sac reduction (25% vs 14% P < .0001). At a threshold of 5 mm in diameter regression, statin use was a positive factor of retraction (odds ratio, 7.93This study showed that statin use was predictive of sac regression after EVAR with the Zenith graft device. This effect needs to be confirmed by larger randomized trials or by large population evaluation.
