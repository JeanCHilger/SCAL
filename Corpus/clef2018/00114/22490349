Extra-anatomic bypass for complex aortic coarctation in adults. To demonstrate an effective operation of extra-anatomic bypass for complex aortic coarctation in adults.Between July 1997 and October 2010, 51 patients underwent extra-anatomic aortic bypass. There were 39 male and 12 female patients. Mean age was (40 ± 14) years (ranging from 18 to 63 years). Operative technique of extra-anatomic bypass consisted of performing an ascending-to-descending or abdominal or femoral aorta bypass (8, 39 and 4 patients). Concomitant procedures were performed in 38 patients: 10 isolated aortic valve replacements (AVR), 11 aortic root replacements (Bentall), 4 ascending aorta replacements including 3 concomitant AVR, 5 mitral valve replacements including 3 concomitant AVR, 4 ventricular septal defect correcting with AVR, and 4 coronary artery bypass graft.Mean follow-up time was (30 ± 9) months (ranging from 5 to 60 months). Two patients were reoperated for hemorrhage in descending aorta anastomosis, one of whom was dead of multiple organ failure in perioperative period. Upper-extremity blood pressure after coarctation correction with extra-anatomic aortic bypass was significantly improved (< 10 mmHg, 1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa). Arterial hypertension was well improved, except 10 patients controlled with less drug therapy. All grafts were patent without obstruction or pseudoaneurysm formation in the follow-up period evaluated by vascular ultrasound and computed tomographic angiogram.Extra-anatomic aortic bypass is a safe and effective option for complex aortic coarctation in adults.
