Early follow-up after endovascular aneurysm repair: is the first postoperative computed tomographic angiography scan necessary? To examine whether initial postoperative computed tomographic angiography (CTA) is needed in all patients undergoing endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).A total of 105 consecutive patients underwent EVAR with standard infrarenal devices in our department between November 2009 and May 2011. Five patients were excluded due to severe renal insufficiency, leaving 100 (85 men median age 73 years, range 46-91) eligible for prospective enrollment in a triple-modality early postoperative follow-up protocol [intraoperative completion angiography, postoperative duplex ultrasonography (DUS), and plain abdominal radiography). Findings were compared for sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) against the first postoperative CTA results for the detection of endoleaks or other signs of EVAR failure.There were 10 inconclusive DUS examinations. In the remaining 90 patients, DUS had 75.0% sensitivity, 95.4% specificity, 85.7% PPV, and 91.5% NPV for the detection of endoleaks. The intraoperative angiogram, DUS, and abdominal radiograph combined resulted in 87.5% sensitivity and 95.4% specificity, with a 65.6% PPV and 94.8% NPV for the detection of endoleaks. In 2 patients who required a reintervention for endoleak in the early postoperative period, both endoleaks were correctly detected by the triple-modality early postoperative follow-up protocol.An early follow-up protocol consisting of an intraoperative completion angiogram, DUS, and abdominal radiograph shows a high sensitivity and NPV for the detection of endoleaks and should detect early migration or kinking of the stent-graft. An initial postoperative CTA is not necessary for most patients undergoing EVAR and should be reserved for those individuals in whom the aforementioned modalities are inconclusive or show signs of endoleak or other EVAR failure.
