Long-term outcome of aortic dissection with patent false lumen: predictive role of entry tear size and location. Patent false lumen in aortic dissection has been associated with poor prognosis. We aimed to assess the natural evolution of this condition and predictive factors.One hundred eighty-four consecutive patients, 108 surgically treated type A and 76 medically treated type B, were discharged after an acute aortic dissection with patent false lumen. Transesophageal echocardiography was performed before discharge, and computed tomography was performed at 3 months and yearly thereafter. Median follow-up was 6.42 years (quartile 1 to quartile 3: 3.31-10.49). Forty-nine patients died during follow-up (22 type A, 27 type B), 31 suddenly. Surgical or endovascular treatment was indicated in 10 type A and 25 type B cases. Survival free from sudden death and surgical-endovascular treatment was 0.90, 0.81, and 0.46 (95% CI, 0.36-0.55) at 3, 5, and 10 years, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified baseline maximum descending aorta diameter (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.32 [1.10-1.59] P=0.003), proximal location (HR: 1.84 [1.06-3.19]Aortic dissection with persistent patent false lumen carries a high risk of complications. In addition to Marfan syndrome and aorta diameter, a large entry tear located in the proximal part of the dissection identifies a high-risk subgroup of patients who may benefit from earlier and more aggressive therapy.
