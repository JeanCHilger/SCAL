Retroperitoneal trapdoor endarterectomy for paravisceral "coral-reef" aortic plaque. A 67-year-old woman presented to the emergency room with progressive claudication, chest pain, and flash-pulmonary edema. Her past medical history was significant for poorly controlled hypertension requiring multiple antihypertensive medications, renal insufficiency, and tobacco abuse. Diagnostic evaluation revealed an extensive exophytic plaque localized to the paravisceral aorta resulting in high-grade stenoses of the proximal aorta as well as the celiac, superior mesenteric, and left renal arteries. She underwent surgical revascularization through a retroperitoneal aortic exposure and trapdoor aortic endarterectomy, the technical conduct of which is described in this manuscript. The patient recovered uneventfully and experienced resolution of her claudication and pulmonary symptoms, improved blood pressure control, and normalization of her creatinine. Review of the medical literature pertaining to management of proximal occlusive disease of the abdominal aorta is discussed.
