Current clinical practice in postoperative endovascular aneurysm repair imaging surveillance. To investigate the current clinical practice in postoperative endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) imaging surveillance.Corresponding authors of EVAR publications during the years 2006-2011 and subscribers to an endovascular journal were invited to complete a 27-question online survey related to institutional demographics, standard post-EVAR imaging surveillance, and imaging protocols in special circumstances (eg, renal insufficiency).The survey was completed by 515 of 9,631 physicians performing EVAR from 52 countries. Of respondents, 65.3% were affiliated with experienced centers where EVAR has been performed for > 10 years or with > 50 EVAR procedures performed per year. Computed tomography (CT) angiography was the modality used most often for standard surveillance with a maximum time interval between studies of 12 months in 78.8% of centers out to 5 years. Experienced centers were more likely to delay follow-up imaging to 1 year after an unremarkable initial post-EVAR imaging study (P < .001), to extend surveillance intervals > 12 months (P = .043), and to use ultrasound (P < .01) for surveillance. After the detection of a type II endoleak, CT angiography was favored for follow-up by 59.4% of the respondents. Experienced centers were more likely to favor ultrasound (P = .006) and to schedule this follow-up examination later (after 6-12 months, P < .001). Of respondents, 62.8% used a glomerular filtration rate threshold of < 30 mL/min for not performing contrast-enhanced CT scan. In patients with renal insufficiency, most respondents performed ultrasound with or without a concomitant noncontrast CT scan.CT is the most frequently used method of long-term surveillance after EVAR. Use of ultrasound for long-term surveillance, extension of follow-up time intervals, or both were most often reported in experienced centers.
