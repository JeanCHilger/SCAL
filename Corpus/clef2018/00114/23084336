Autotransplantation for the treatment of severe renal artery stenosis in a solitary kidney after repeated percutaneous transluminal angioplasty: a case report. A 66-year-old female suffering from massive atherosclerosis with a long history of renal artery stenosis in the left solitary kidney was admitted to reevaluate an in-stent restenosis. Advanced peripheral arterial disease had formerly been treated by aortobifemoral bypass surgery and a highly eccentric infrarenal abdominal aortic stenosis of 70 - 80% had been treated by patch angioplasty. In this patient several percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasties after a former stent deployment had resulted in recurrent in-stent restenoses. The renal artery stenosis was reevaluated and a re-angioplasty attempt was unsuccessful due to technical failure. Blood pressure remained difficult to manage. Renal function decreased as a result of presumed acute renal failure. A further progression of the renal artery stenosis was found. Autotransplantation to the left iliac fossa was done, because aortorenal bypass was considered impossible. Renal function normalized and follow-up Doppler ultrasonography examinations revealed a newly developed ostial anastomotic stenosis of 60 - 70%. While medical therapy and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with stent deployment are common treatment options, surgical interventions are reserved for cases of complex stenoses. Autotransplantation as a complex option in the treatment of renal artery stenosis seems to be an adequate alternative in patients with severe, generalized atherosclerosis after failure of interventional procedures and the impossibility of standard surgical techniques.
