Endovascular treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms: 6 years of experience at a single centre. We sought to assess the effectiveness of endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair (EVAR) through a retrospective review of 6 years' experience at a single centre.From April 2005 to August 2011, 222 patients affected by abdominal aortic aneurysms underwent EVAR. We evaluated primary technical success, postprocedural mortality, intraprocedural and postprocedural complications with contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (US) follow-up at 1, 6 and 12 months and annually thereafter.The procedures were elective in 75.7% and urgent due to symptomatic or ruptured aneurysm in 24.3%. Technical success was 98.6% three patients (1.4%) required conversion to open surgery. Postoperative mortality rate was 24% for urgent and 2.3% for elective procedures. During a mean follow-up period of 29.6 months, no cases of stent-graft migration were observedConsistent with the literature data, our study confirms the safety and long-term efficacy of EVAR for treating AAA.
