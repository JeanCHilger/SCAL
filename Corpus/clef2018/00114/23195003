Transposition of iliac vessels in implantation of right living donor kidneys. The rate of right laparoscopic living-donor nephrectomy (RLLDN) is low among kidney transplantations due to the short renal vein and presumed higher risk of thrombosis. Our objective was to describe a surgical technique to compensate for the shorter veins of these grafts.Between January 2004 and July 2010, we prospectively collected data from all transplantations using RLLDN-harvested kidneys at our center. Recipient iliac vein transposition was performed in all patients. We reviewed the indications, surgical techniques, and postoperative courses.The 43 included cases showed a 2.1 +/- 0.6 cm, average length of the right renal vein as measured on abdominal computed tomography (CT). The mean extraction and implantation times were 109 +/- 33 and 124 +/- 31 minutes, respectively the mean warm ischemia time was 151 +/- 29 seconds. Two recipients required postsurgical blood transfusions. In 97.6% of cases, there was immediate urine flow. Postoperative echo-Doppler revealed good arterial and venous flows in all patients. No venous thromboses were detected. The recipients' average hospital stay was 8 +/- 5 days. With a mean follow-up of 57 months, 86% of recipients maintain a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) >50 mL/min and creatinine levels <1.5 mg/dL.Transposition of the recipient iliac vein during implantation is a good technical solution to compensate for the short length of the right renal vein. The use of iliac vein transposition allowed us to perform safe implants of RLLDN-harvested kidneys with good short-term and long-term results.
