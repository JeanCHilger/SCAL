Treatment of traumatic penile urethral stricture in a dog with a self-expanding, covered nitinol stent. An 8-month-old castrated male mixed-breed dog was evaluated because of hematuria, stranguria, and dysuria of approximately 2 weeks' duration that developed immediately following elective castration.Results of physical examination, ultrasonography, retrograde double-contrast cystourethrography, and urethroscopy were consistent with a traumatic urethral stricture immediately proximal to the os penis resulting in a partial obstruction of urine outflow. Results of ultrasonographic examination of abdominal organs were considered normal. Digital radiography revealed no evidence of calculi.Balloon dilation of the urethral stricture was performed and was followed by 2 bougienage procedures during the subsequent 2 weeks when clinical signs returned. The owners declined scrotal urethrostomy, and a self-expanding, covered nitinol stent was placed approximately 3 weeks after the initial evaluation, resulting in amelioration of clinical signs. Results of follow-up urethroscopy and contrast cystourethrography 1 year after stent placement revealed a statically positioned, patent urethral stent, although a small number of polypoid mucosal structures were identified distal to the stent and 1 small structure consistent with tissue ingrowth into the stent was identified.Placement of a covered nitinol stent resulted in long-term resolution of clinical signs associated with traumatic stricture of the penile urethra in this young dog. Because the os penis in dogs limits radial expansion of the urethra, its presence may limit the use of stents in this location.
