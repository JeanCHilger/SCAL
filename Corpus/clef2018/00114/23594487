Ruptured aneurysm of the right coronary sinus of Valsalva in a child with Down syndrome. Aneurysms of one of the aortic sinuses of Valsalva are rare congenital or acquired lesions. Here we present the case of an adolescent with Down syndrome with ruptured aneurysm of the right coronary sinus into the right atrium. All sinuses of Valsalva were normal during cardiological screening owing to Down syndrome at the age of 2 weeks. Paediatricians should have a low threshold for referring patients with Down syndrome for cardiac re-evaluation because of the new onset of cardiac symptoms or cardiac physical findings, even in the situation in which there are normal echocardiographic findings in the past.
