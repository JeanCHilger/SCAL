Focal histopathological progression of porcine experimental abdominal aortic aneurysm is mitigated by atorvastatin. Observational studies in human patients and animal experiments suggested that statins have a potential in slowing the growth of small abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). Our aim was to quantify histological postoperative changes of AAA in porcine experimental model of AAA with and without administration of atorvastatin.The AAA was induced by intraaortic infusion of porcine pancreatic elastase and subrenal application of plastic cuff. The AAA statin group (N.=14) received atorvastatin 1 mg/kg daily for 28 days, the other AAA group (N.=13) did not. The aortic diameter was measured by ultrasonography. Aortic samples were described using eleven quantitative histological parameters and compared with healthy aortae.There was no difference in aortic diameter between the AAA with statin when compared to AAA without statin. Administration of atorvastatin led to a better postoperative histological condition of the aortic elastin network, preservation of contractile phenotype of vascular smooth muscle, a higher density of vasa vasorum, it prevented thickening of intima and media. The increase in wall thickness in AAA without atorvastatin has not been accompanied by a proportional increase in number of vasa vasorum.The effects of atorvastatin seem to prevent the histopathological progression of AAA.
