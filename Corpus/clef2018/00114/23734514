Quality of life in patients of different age groups with ischemic heart disease: effect of multifocal atherosclerosis. The aim of the research was to study the quality of life for the patients of different age groups with coronary artery disease and to evaluate the factors affecting its decline. The present study included 709 patients aged 31 to 79 years examined before elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery. All patients underwent coronary angiography, echocardiography, ultrasonography of the aorta, brachiocephalic, and peripheral arteries. With age, significantly increased incidence of multifocal atherosclerosis (p = 0.01 for the trend). To study the quality of life (QL) a non-specific questionnaire SF-36 was used, according to which the reduction of QL equally in all the groups (p > 0.05) was detected. Multivariate analysis showed that the level of QL was influenced by diabetes, myocardial infarction and the presence of multifocal atherosclerosis (p < 0.05). Thus, in order to improve the QL in aged patients with multifocal atherosclerosis is reasonable to conduct of reconstructive operations at different arterial basins.
