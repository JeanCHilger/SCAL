Use of the recipient celiac trunk for hepatic artery reconstruction in orthotopic liver transplantation. Arterial complications contribute to significant morbidity and mortality after liver transplantation (OLT). If hepatic artery inflow to the graft is inadequate, alternative approaches can be considered, such as supraceliac or infrarenal aortic conduits and splenic artery as an arterial inflow. Between January 2005 and January 2012, we performed 928 OLTs. We used the recipient celiac trunk for arterial inflow in 9 patients (1%). evaluated retrospectively, We the indications, results, and outcome of this technique. Doppler ultrasound of the liver was used to evaluate arterial flow. Eight cases are first transplant and 1 case is a second transplant. Five cases are pediatric recipients and four cases are adult recipients. Male to female ratio is 3/6. Average follow-up is 23 months. No complications were encountered as a result of sacrificing the branches of the celiac axis. The conclusion is that the celiac trunk provides an adequate arterial inflow in OLT when the recipient's hepatic artery is not suitable to use.
