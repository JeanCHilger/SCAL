Feasibility of hand-held-ultrasonography in the screening of abdominal aortic aneurysms and abdominal aortic atherosclerosis. To determine the prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and abdominal aortic atheromatosis (AA-At) using a hand-held ultrasound by a general practitioner in the public Primary Health Care system.Pilot study that prospectively studied a cohort of men over 50 years with cardiovascular risk factors: active smokers, former smokers, or hypertensive patients, attended in primary health care center. The general practitioner completed an ultrasonography training in an Ultrasound Unit under supervision of experienced radiologists using an standard ultrasound equipment and hand-held ultrasound (VScan(®), General Electric, USA). One hundred and six patients participated in the study and all imaging data recorded were blindly evaluated by a radiologist in order to establish the concordance in the interpretation of images between general practitioner and radiologist. The kappa index was calculated to study the agreement on the presence or absence of AAA and AA-At.We observed a prevalence of 5.88% of AAA. Kappa index for concordance in AAA diagnosis was absolute (κ = 1.0), with a sensitivity and specificity of 100%. Otherwise, the general practitioner identified 59 patients (58.4%) with AA-At, while radiologist identified 39 (38.6%) in the image review, with moderate concordance (κ = .435), sensitivity 89.74% and specificity 57.14%. Hypercholesterolemia (odds ratio [OR] 2.61 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.92-7.39) and diabetes mellitus (OR 3.35After an adequate training in ultrasonography, hand-held ultrasound is a useful tool for AAA screening in Primary Care. Its simplicity, security, validity, cost-effectiveness and acceptance by the general population, makes it a feasible tool for cardiovascular risk assessment.
