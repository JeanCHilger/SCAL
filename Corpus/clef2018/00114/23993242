Engineering goals for future thoracic endografts-how can we make them more effective? Endovascular treatments for catastrophic aortic conditions have gained increasing popularity over the past 20 years. Originally developed for abdominal aortic aneurysms (EVAR), treatment has been modified for use in thoracic aortic repair (TEVAR). As expanding numbers of patients with increasingly intractable conditions and more hostile anatomies are treated, endovascular stent designs are maturing to be suitable for these more demanding situations. This article discusses the engineering considerations that apply to changing stent graft designs for current and evolving thoracic applications. The biological parameters that differentiate thoracic from abdominal aortic environments are outlined. Factors concerning materials, sealing mechanisms, deployment, stent frame architecture, and migration resistance are described, and eagerly awaited potential future developments are summarized.
