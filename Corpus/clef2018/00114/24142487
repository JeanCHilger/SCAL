A case of carotid artery dissection after surgical repair of aortic dissection successfully treated with endovascular therapy using intravascular ultrasound. A 71-year-old woman developed the dissection from right brachiocephalic trunk (BCT) to internal carotid artery 6Â days after the operation of ascending aortic dissection. Since no improvement of symptoms was observed despite conservative therapy, we performed endovascular therapy (EVT). Although a balloon-expandable stent was implanted in the BCT to seal the entry point of the dissection, the true lumen of the carotid artery was still compressed. Thus, we covered the dissected lesion completely with multiple stents, and her neurological findings improved. This case demonstrates that EVT using multiple stents is an effective strategy to manage dissection of supra-aortic branches.
