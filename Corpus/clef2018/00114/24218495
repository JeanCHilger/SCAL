Efficacy of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography in detecting graft rupture sites after abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Non-anastomotic graft rupture is a rare but critical complication after abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. Therefore, identifying the rupture sites is important to perform endovascular stent grafting. A 78-year old man who had undergone Y-grafting for infrarenal AAA before 17 years was referred to our hospital with the complaints of abdominal pain. Computed tomography revealed acute pancreatitis and an enlargement around the grafted abdominal aorta. Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography revealed an extravazation from the graft body 1.5 cm distal to the proximal anastomosis, and endovascular stent grafting was successfully performed. Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography might be useful in detecting the graft rupture.
