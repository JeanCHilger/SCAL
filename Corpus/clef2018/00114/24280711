Total arch repair with open triple-branched stent graft placement for acute type A aortic dissection: experience with 122 patients. To summarize the clinical experiences and midterm follow-up results of total arch repair with open triple-branched stent graft placement for acute type A aortic dissection.From June 2008 to March 2013, 122 patients (95 men and 27 women mean age, 50.9 ± 10.4 years) with acute type A aortic dissection underwent total arch repair with open placement of a triple-branched stent graft under hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass and selective cerebral perfusion. During the follow-up period, enhanced computed tomography and echocardiography were performed at 3 months postoperatively and annually thereafter.Placement of the triple-branched stent graft into the true lumen of the descending aorta, arch, and 3 arch vessels was technically successful in 121 patients. The cardiopulmonary bypass time was 186.50 ± 38.23 minutes, and the selective antegrade cerebral perfusion time was 31.97 ± 10.08 minutes. The in-hospital mortality was 4.93%. No permanent neurologic dysfunction or paraplegia was observed. Three patients were lost to follow-up. The mean follow-up period was 30.24 ± 12.35 months. After hospital discharge, 3 patients died. On the 3-month postoperative scans, complete thrombus formation around the triple-branched stent graft was observed in 89.38% of the patients. Endoleaks were detected in 12 patients 8 patients refused any management for the endoleaks, but they maintained a good quality of life. The other 4 patients were successfully treated by additional surgery.Total arch repair with open triple-branched stent graft placement is an effective technique with satisfactory early and midterm results. This technique could be an attractive alternative to conventional total arch replacement.
