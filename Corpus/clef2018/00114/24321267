Recurrent hematuria caused by nutcracker syndrome. A 26-year-old woman presented to the emergency department complaining of left flank pain, and proteinuria and hematuria were detected during urinalysis. A renal ultrasound did not reveal any disorder, and after performing a computed tomography angiography scan, compression of the left renal vein between the superior mesenteric artery and the aorta was seen. This compression is known as Nutcracker syndrome. From among the different treatment options available, it was decided, with patient consensus, to use open surgical management, performing a transposition of the left renal vein to a more distal level in the inferior vena cava. The immediate postoperative care progressed without complications and the symptoms resolved after 1 year of surveillance, the patient continues to be asymptomatic. Nutcracker syndrome is a rare phenomenon, with few cases described. There are different therapeutic options for the treatment of Nutcracker syndrome, such as open surgery, endovascular treatment, or conservative treatment
