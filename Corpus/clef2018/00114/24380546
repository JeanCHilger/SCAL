Treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm with a new type of polymer-filled low profile device. To evaluate the mid-term safety and effectiveness of a novel stent graft for treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).Thirty-three patients with AAA (20 males and 13 females mean age: 71.3 y) were treated with the Ovation™ Abdominal Stent Graft System (TriVascular, Inc., Santa Rosa, CA, USA). Indications for endovascular aneurysm repair: AAA ≥ 5.5 cm, neck ≥ 7 mm, angulation ≤ 60° and with an inner wall diameter of no less than 16 mm and no greater than 30 mmTechnical success was 100%. Mean implantation procedure time was 31.1 minutes, and median hospital stay was 4.6 days. None of the patients required conversion to open surgery, and no aneurysm enlargement, rupture, fracture, or migration were observed. No type I, III or IV endoleaks were observed. Hospitalization death rate was 0%. Death rate at 30 days was 0%. No major complications were observed.The first results from this 3-center study with the Ovation stent graft are promising with high technical success and excellent safety and effectiveness.
