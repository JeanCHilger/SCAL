Type A acute aortic dissection: why does the false channel remain patent after surgery? To understand why the false channel (FC) remains patent after surgery of type A acute aortic dissection (TAAAD).Postoperative contrast-enhanced computed tomography scans of 129 patients operated for TAAAD were analyzed, and a color-Doppler ultrasound examination (CDUS) of the supra-aortic vessels (SAVs) was performed in 12 patients.The FC remained patent in 107 (82.9%) patients. The entry site was situated near the distal anastomosis in 43 (40.2%) patients and far from it in 44 (41.1%) patients. In 10 (9.35%) patients, an entry site was observed only in the SAVs. In 10 (9.35%) patients, no entry site was seen. Of the 12 patients explored with CDUS, a retrograde filling of the FC was observed in 11 patients.The frequent postoperative circulating aortic FC can be explained by the persistence of the primary entry tear, the presence of iatrogenic tears, and/or a retrograde filling in the SAVs.
