Non-operative management of a grade IV pancreatic injury. Isolated pancreatic transection with ductal disruption in blunt abdominal trauma is extremely rare. We report the case of a 14-year-old boy who suffered pancreatic transection at the junction of body and head of the pancreas yet remarkably recovered after initial conservative management. He was periodically examined clinically and underwent regular abdominal ultrasonography. Nearly 6 months later, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with pancreatic duct stenting, pancreatic sphincterotomy and cystogastrostomy for the pseudocyst diagnosed during the follow-up period was performed. Acute surgical management of pancreatic transection is fraught with high mortality and morbidity. Through this effort, we highlight the successful role of non-operative management of a haemodynamically stable patient with grade IV pancreatic injury, thereby avoiding radical surgery in the acute stage and preserving exocrine and endocrine function.
