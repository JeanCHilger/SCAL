Results of reinterventions for failed endovascular aortic repair: a single-center experience. The aim of this paper was to review technical success and clinical outcome of reinterventions to treat complications after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair (EVAR) in a tertiary vascular center.The study enrolled 107 patients treated for post-EVAR complications between January 2005 and March 2014. Details of reinterventions, technical success, and midterm clinical outcome were analyzed for reinterventions. Radiologic follow-up after reinterventions was performed by computed tomography scans and duplex ultrasonography.Indications for reinterventions in the 107 patients were predominantly endoleaks type Ia, Ib, II, and III (55.1%). Endograft obstructions were observed in 39 patients (36.4%). The initial technical success rate for the 107 reinterventions was 93.5% (N.=100). Median follow-up postreintervention was 20 months (range, 1-107 months). During follow-up, 34 of 107 patients (31.8%) needed at least one renewed reintervention. Kaplan-Meier analysis of overall survival after the primary reinterventions was 85% at 1 year, and 78% at 3 years of follow-up. AAA/EVAR-associated mortality was 4% at 3 years. Kaplan-Meier survival estimation of freedom of recurrence was 88% at 1 year post-reintervention and 78% at 3 years. Renewed reintervention-free survival dropped to 78% at 1 year and 58% at 3 years.In this series of patients, the technical success rate of reinterventions to treat post-EVAR complications was high. During a median follow-up of 20 months, AAA-associated mortality is low, but the need for renewed (endovascular) reinterventions is substantial.
