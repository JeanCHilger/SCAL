Transcatheter intervention for complex ascending aortic pseudoaneurysm after cardiac surgery. Ascending aortic pseudoaneurysm (PsA) is an uncommon but surgically challenging problem with high morbidity and mortality. Herein we describe the efficacy and safety of the different approaches to transcatheter intervention for repair of ascending PsA and assess the selection of occluder devices using real-time 3-dimensional (RT 3D) color Doppler transesophageal echocardiography (TEE).METHODS AND RESULTS: Three patients with complex ascending PsA after cardiac or aortic root surgery were treated with transcatheter intervention due to high risk for redo surgery. Perioperative RT 3D-TEE combined with fluoroscopy was used for monitoring. All ascending PsA were successfully occluded with different devices using the transcatheter technique either with the transapical, transarterial approach, or transvenous combined with hybrid process depending on lesion anatomy.Treatment of complex ascending PsA with transcatheter or combined hybrid intervention with cautious planning based on patient presentation and well-coordinated teamwork was successful. RT 3D color Doppler TEE provided precise information for the selection of appropriate occluder device, and also facilitated the procedure by guiding the catheter through difficult anatomy.
