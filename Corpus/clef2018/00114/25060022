Outcomes with post-dilation following transcatheter aortic valve replacement: the PARTNER I trial (placement of aortic transcatheter valve). This study sought to characterize the patients receiving post-implantation balloon dilation (PD) following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and evaluate procedural outcomes in the PARTNER (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valve) I trial.Following TAVR, PD has been used to treat paravalvular regurgitation.The PARTNER I trial cohort A (n = 304) and cohort B (n = 194) patients randomized to TAVR and the nonrandomized continued access TAVR (n = 1,637) patients were included in the analysis. PD was performed at the discretion of the operator. Clinical events and echocardiographic variables were collected prospectively out to 1 year.The overall incidence of PD was 12.4%. PD patients had significantly less prosthesis-patient mismatch (p < 0.001) and larger effective orifice areas (p < 0.001) throughout the follow-up period. There were significantly more subacute strokes (occurring <7 days: 4.9% vs. 2.6% p = 0.04) in PD patients but no difference in late stroke, either at 7 to 30 days (0.0% vs. 0.8%PD is associated with reduced rates of moderate or severe prosthesis-patient mismatch with no evidence for short-term structural deterioration of the balloon-expandable transcatheter valve. Although PD is associated with a greater incidence of early stroke, there is no significant association between PD and stroke beyond 7 days. Multivariable analysis shows no significant association between PD and mortality.
