Relationship between the two surgical access of aortoiliac occlusive disease and recovery of ED. Aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD) can occur anywhere from the distal abdominal aorta to the common femoral arteries. Patients with AIOD may be asymptomatic or may have intermittent claudication or critical limb ischemia. ED in the young males may be the first symptom of aortoiliac disease. The aims of this study were to determine the outcome of ED in patients who underwent aortoiliac surgery and evaluate the effect of revascularization upon erectile function (EF) by using the international index of EF questionnaire and color duplex Doppler ultrasonography. A total of 60 patients under 65-year-old age eligible for elective repair of AIOD s were included in this study. The patients were randomly divided into two equal groups. The first group (group A) patients were operated by minimally invasive retroperitoneal approach (RPA) and the second group (group B) patients were operated by transperitoneal approach (TPA) to the aorta. The quality of sexual function scale was evaluated preoperatively and at 6 months postoperatively. Surgical revascularization when appropriate, symptomatic AIOD and ED are often improved. As a result of our study, RPA to the aorta is superior to TPA because of recovering with the higher systolic velocity values of penile Doppler in ED cases.
