Endovascular aneurysm sealing for juxtarenal aneurysm using the Nellix device and chimney covered stents. To show the feasibility of the Nellix device in conjunction with a chimney technique for treating juxtarenal aneurysms in two patients who were deemed unsuitable for fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair or open surgery.Two men aged 83 and 81 years were referred with a juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (66 and 69 mm, respectively). Both were considered for open surgery as well as custom-made fenestrated stent-graft but deemed unsuitable for both options. They were both treated using the Nellix endoprosthesis in combination with chimney grafts to preserve the renal arteries. Technical success was achieved in both cases, with successful aneurysm exclusion and target vessel preservation (the right renal artery in the first case and both renal arteries in the second). At 6 months, duplex ultrasound and computed tomographic angiography of the first patient showed no signs of endoleak and patent renal arteries. The second patient developed a right retroperitoneal hematoma with minor extravasation near the lower pole of the right kidney for which coil embolization was necessary. The subsequent clinical sequelae led to respiratory insufficiency and ultimately death.The use of the Nellix endoprosthesis combined with chimney grafts is technically feasible. The addition of chimney grafts can increase the applicability of endovascular aneurysm sealing to treat short-neck and juxtarenal aneurysms. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and establish longer term outcome.
