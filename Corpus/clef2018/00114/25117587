Post-operative echocardiographic evaluation of bioprosthetic mitral valve implantation in sheep. The ovine model is generally considered to be the best for testing bioprosthetic heart valve durability. Although echocardiography is the method of choice for the interim evaluation of the valve, literature on sheep echocardiography is scarce. Within the context of a study on treatment of pericardial heart valve prostheses, 19 adolescent sheep underwent transthoracic echocardiography six days after mitral implantation of bioprosthetic valves. Echocardiographic examination was performed under mild anesthesia and animals were put in a right lateral decubitus position. Four images were obtained: right parasternal long axis four and five chamber views, right parasternal long axis view with left ventricular outflow, and right parasternal short axis view through the mitral valve. We measured aortic annulus and velocity time integral over the aortic valve to determine stroke volume, cardiac output and cardiac index. The mitral valve was evaluated through color Doppler imaging for valvular and paravalvular leakages. Pulsed wave spectral Doppler was used for the measurement of velocities, pressures and velocity time integrals. For the evaluation of valve stenosis deceleration time and pressure half-time were determined. Effective orifice area of the mitral valve was derived. And, although not measured, other structures could clearly be visualized: right and left ventricle and atrium, wall thicknesses, tricuspid valve. This study shows that echocardiography in sheep is feasible, and that right parasternal images, obtained in animals in a right lateral decubitus position, are well qualified for the interim evaluation of bioprosthetic valves implanted in the mitral position. Besides the implanted valve, other cardiac structures like atria and ventricles can be visualized and evaluated.
