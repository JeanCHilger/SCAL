Value of high-resolution contrast-enhanced ultrasound in detection and characterisation of endoleaks after EVAR. To compare the value of high-resolution contrast-enhanced ultrasound in the detection and characterisation of endoleaks after EVAR.In this retrospective study, a cohort of 80 patients underwent both standard examination using a curved array 5 MHz transducer and a second examination using a curved array 9 MHz transducer. The examination included B-mode, color Doppler and contrast-enhanced ultrasound using the Philips EPIQ 7 scanner.80 patients were included in the study. CEUS was used as the preferred examination in determining the presence of an endoleak. The sensitivity and specificity for the detection of endoleak using the 5 MHz transducer was: CEUS (96.8%, 100%), Color Doppler (47.6%, 94.1%), B-mode (15.8%, 94.1%), while for the 9 MHz transducer: CEUS (100%, 100%), Color Doppler (39.7%, 94.1%), B-mode (23.8%, 24.1%).High resolution ultrasound (9 MHz) in detection and characterization of endoleaks after EVAR has some minor advantages in comparison to lower resolution ultrasound (5 MHz).
