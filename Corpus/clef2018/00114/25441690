Results of the endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair using the Anaconda aortic endograft. The objective of this study was to evaluate early and late results of the Anaconda aortic endograft (Vascutek, Terumo, Inchinnan, Scotland) in a single-center experience.From September 2005 to March 2012, patients underwent endovascular aortic repair for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with Anaconda endograft were prospectively enrolled in a dedicated database. Demographic and aortoiliac morphological data were considered. Preoperative planning was based on thoracoabdominal and pelvic computed tomography angiography. Follow-up included duplex ultrasound or computed tomography angiography at 1, 6, and 12 months and yearly thereafter. Primary end points were technical success, early and late primary and primary assisted clinical success (CS), overall and AAA-related survival and freedom from reinterventions. Secondary end points were endoleaks (ELs), steno-obstructive iliac leg complications, and AAA shrinkage.An Anaconda endograft was implanted in 177 patients (male 94% mean age, 73.3 ± 7.4 yearsData in our series demonstrate that the Anaconda endograft has good early and late results in the treatment of AAAs.
