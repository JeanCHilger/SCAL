Successful image-guided percutaneous embolization of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm sac due to type II endoleak after endovascular repair. The rupture of an aneurysm sac secondary to endoleak type II after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair is a rare occurrence, routinely corrected by open surgery. Computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous embolization of the aneurysm sac is a safe, efficient, and minimally invasive treatment option. We present a case of an endoleak type II associated to aneurysm sac rupture successfully treated by CT-guided percutaneous embolization of the aneurysm sac.
