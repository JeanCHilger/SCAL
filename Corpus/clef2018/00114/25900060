Ureteral Trauma During Transvaginal Ultrasound-Guided Oocyte Retrieval: A Case Report. Transvaginal ultrasound-guided oocyte retrieval is a safe and well-tolerated procedure. Complications are uncommon and usually limited to vaginal bleeding and pelvic infection. Ureteral injury following oocyte retrieval is exceedingly rare, with only 8 previously reported cases.A 34-year-old woman developed gross hematuria 4 hours after transvaginal ultrasound-guided oocyte aspiration. Cystoscopy, laparoscopy, and retrograde pyelography revealed bleeding from the left ureter, no intra-abdominal bleeding, and a patent left urinary collecting system. The ureteral bleeding was successfully managed with placement of a ureteral stent.Ureteral trauma during transvaginal-guided oocyte retrieval is a rare complication with a variable clinical presentation. If ureteral injuries are not promptly recognized, significant morbidity may occur. This case demonstrates that early identification of injury and timely intervention result in favorable outcomes.
