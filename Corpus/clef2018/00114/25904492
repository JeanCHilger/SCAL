Endovascular repair of a ruptured pararenal aortic aneurysm using the Nellix endovascular aneurysm sealing system and chimney grafts. To demonstrate the feasibility of emergent endovascular repair of a ruptured pararenal aneurysm using chimney grafts and the Nellix endovascular aneurysm sealing (EVAS) system to reduce the potential for endoleak from the gutters around the chimney grafts.A 74-year-old patient presented with a ruptured pararenal aneurysm. Because of anatomical considerations after previous aortic surgery, conventional endovascular aneurysm repair was deemed impossible. It was decided to exclude the aneurysm with a Nellix EVAS system in conjunction with two chimneys to the renal arteries, even though this was outside the instructions for use of the device. Active bleeding was stopped directly after positioning the chimneys and filling the endobags with polymer. Completion angiography showed aneurysm exclusion and patent renal arteries. Renal function remained stable, and the patient was discharged at the third postoperative day. At 6 months, duplex ultrasound and computed tomography showed patent stents and chimneys and no evidence of endoleak.Using chimney grafts in combination with the Nellix endoprosthesis in a ruptured pararenal aneurysm is feasible. However, more robust data on both chimney-EVAS and EVAS in ruptured cases are required.
