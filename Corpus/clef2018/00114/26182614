Long-Term Results after Aortic Valve-Sparing-Reimplantation Operation (David) in Bicuspid Aortic Valve. The aortic valve-sparing reimplantation operation (David) is increasingly used in patients with aortic root aneurysm and intact cusps. David's procedure is also feasible in patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BA), though few long-term data are available.An analysis was conducted of the long-term echocardiographic data from patients with BAV who had undergone David's procedure at early and long-term follow up (FU) examinations.Between 1994 and 2010, a total of 30 patients with BAV underwent David's procedure at the authors'institution. There were no in-hospital or late deaths, and the mean long-term FU was 6.64 ± 3.54 years (range: 3.2-20.1 years). The mean aortic regurgitation (AR) grade was increased from 0.26 ± 0.37 at early FU to 0.70 ± 0.80 at long-term FU (p = 0.013). Four patients (13%) had to be reoperated after 10.00 ± 4.74 years (range: 5.49-17.06 years) due to aortic stenosis (n = 1) and aortic insufficiency (n = 3) the latter three patients had a significant prolapse of both the fused and the non-coronary cusp of reconstruction.The mean AR grade was increased significantly but was ≤ I-II in 59% of patients and ≤ II in 93% of patients after a mean FU of 6.6 years. Patients with prolapsing non-coronary leaflet at reconstruction seemed vulnerable to recurrent AR. Among patients, survival was excellent, and the reoperation rate and hemodynamics acceptable. Long-term follow up data are necessary to further refine the surgical techniques employed and to improve the results achieved.
