Outcome in Men with a Screen-detected Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Who are not Fit for Intervention. Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening in Gloucestershire has been ongoing for 25 years. The aim of this study was to review the outcome of a cohort of men with a large (> 5.4 cm) screen-detected AAA who did not have early intervention for their AAA.A prospectively maintained database was interrogated for a 10-year interval from 2001 to 2011. Men who did not have their large AAA repaired within 3 months of the diagnosis were identified. The reasons for initial nonintervention and subsequent outcomes were identified from a combination of hospital case notes and general practitioner records.Of 334 men referred, 59 (median age 71 years, range 62-83 years) did not have intervention within 3 months (initial nonintervention rate 17.6%). The reasons included placed back on surveillance after assessment (n = 34) immediately discharged (n = 12)Information from studies such as these can be used to help plan treatment of men with a large AAA and to compare performance of vascular units.
