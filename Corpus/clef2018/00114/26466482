EFFECT OF RECOMBINANT HUMAN GROWTH HORMONE ON ENDOTHELIALIZATION OF VASCULAR PROSTHESES. To investigate whether the recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) can promote endothelialization, inhibit vascular intimal hyperplasia, and improve long-term patency rate by the treatment of rhGH after vascular prostheses bypass.Between August 2007 and January 2009, 94 patients with lower extremity arteriosclerotic occlusive disease were treated. Among them, 32 patients (34 limbs) who met the selection criteria were enrolled in this study. All cases were randomly divided into study group (16 cases, 18 limbs) and control group (16 cases, 16 limbs). There was no significant difference (P > 0.05) in gender, age, disease time, location of lesions, the Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) grade, and basic diseases between 2 groups. The patients with superficial femoral artery disease received above-knee femoro-popliteal prostheses bypass. The patients who had combined abdominal-iliac artery disease received concurrent abdominal-femoral and femoro-popliteal prostheses bypass. Subcutaneous injection of 9 U rhGH was given every night for 7 days in study group, and saline was applied in control group. Ultrasonography was taken after 2 weeks and 3 months of operation to observe the patency and measure the wall thickness of vascular prostheses.After operation, 1 patient of control group died of renal failure caused by acute thrombosis. After 2 weeks, ultrasonography showed no obvious intimal hyperplasia in 2 groups the wall thickness was (0.13 ± 0.02) cm in study group and (0.15 ± 0.03) cm in control group, showing no significant difference (t = -1.720, P = 0.108). After 3 months, the wall thickness was (0.17 ± 0.06) cm in study group and was (0.26 ± 0.09) cm in control group, showing significant difference (t = -2.240, P = 0.045). All cases were followed up 36-60 months (mean, 56.4 months). The 5-year primary patency rate was 52.5% in study group and 35.7% in control group, showing no significant difference (χ2 = 1.470, P = 0.225).The rhGH can improve endothelialization in vascular prostheses and can inhibit postoperative vascular intimal hyperplasia in clinical application.
