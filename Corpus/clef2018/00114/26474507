Surveillance outcomes of small abdominal aortic aneurysms identified from a large screening program. Surveillance of patients identified with small abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) from an AAA screening program poses a challenge for health systems because of numerous patient follow-ups. This study evaluates the surveillance outcomes of patients identified with small AAA from a large screening program.A retrospective chart review of all patients screened for small AAA (3.0-5.4 cm) from 2007 to 2011 was conducted. Patients with small AAA and no previous history of repair were tracked for follow-up using the 2013 RESCAN follow-up guidelines according to aortic diameter (3.0-3.9 cm, 3 years 4.0-4.4 cm, 2 yearsA total of 568 patients (mean ± standard deviation, 73.4 ± 7.2 years old) with small AAA (3.6 ± 0.6 cm) were analyzed. Patient follow-up rate was 65.1% (n = 370 of 568). Reasons for follow-up failure were lack of the physician's ordering a scan (n = 139 70.2%), delayed ordering of scans (n = 36The follow-up rate of patients with small AAA was poor at 65.1%. The data indicate that socioeconomic factors do not significantly affect follow-up success. Therefore, physician ordering of scans may exert the greatest influence on follow-up rates in patients with small AAA. Automatic ordering of follow-up scans for patients with small AAAs is proposed to improve follow-up rates.
