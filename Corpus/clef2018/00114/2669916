Endoaortic calcific proliferation of the upper abdominal aorta. Endoaortic calcified proliferation, also known as coral reef atherosclerosis represents a rare form of atherosclerosis characterized by a gross appearance and location in the thoracic and celiac aorta. We report two new cases of calcified obstruction of the aorta. In the first case, clinical examination revealed hypertension, abdominal angina associated with abdominal bruit, and diminished femoral pulses. The second case was diagnosed postoperatively when intractable hypertension and renal failure ensued following reconstruction of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Accurate evaluation of lesions was possible through Doppler sonography, CT scan, and aortography. Because of hypertension and visceral ischemia, surgical treatment was required. Hypertension and intestinal angina were completely relieved in the first case, while hypertension and renal failure improved greatly in the second.
