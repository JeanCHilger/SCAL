Conventional Aortic Valve Replacement after Displacement of a Percutaneously Implanted Aortic Prosthesis: Case Report. A case is described of aortic stenosis that was initially treated with transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) due to a high-risk profile. Following dysfunction of the TAVI prosthesis, conventional aortic valve replacement (AVR) was successfully performed the subsequent postoperative course was uneventful. In conclusion, the target population for TAVI must be more accurately specified, with further research helping to define whether AVR or TAVI is the best treatment option for 'intermediate-risk' patients.
