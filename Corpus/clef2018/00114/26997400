Takayasu arteritis associated with severe renovascular hypertension. Takayasu arteritis (TA) is an inflammatory process frequently associated with stenosis and obliteration of the aorta and its primary branches. We report a 16-year-old girl in whom TA manifested mainly with a sudden decrease in visual acuity and severe arterial hypertension in both legs. Bilateral radial pulses were absent. Ultrasound showed renal size asymmetry and raised the possibility of renal artery stenosis. The diagnosis of TA was confirmed by computed tomography angiography, which showed a thickened abdominal aortic wall and narrowing of its lumen. In addition, occlusions of left renal artery and of both left and right subclavian arteries were observed. Hypertension was hardly under control by a combination of three antihypertensive drugs. The outcome was favorable with corticosteroids alone with regression of the clinical signs, disappearance of inflammation, and control of hypertension.
