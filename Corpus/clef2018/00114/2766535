Use of surgical glue without replacement in the treatment of type A aortic dissection. Between 1984 and 1988, 15 patients with type A aortic dissection were treated by direct suturing of the intimal tear and extensive sticking of the dissected aortic layers with surgical (gelatin-resorcin-formaldehyde) glue without prosthetic graft replacement. Aortic incompetence was present in 10 patients, a situation that required valvular replacement in five and valvular repair in five. In 10 patients, the dissection extended to the transverse aortic arch, requiring profound hypothermia and circulatory arrest. All patients survived the operation. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 44 months. All patients were monitored by Doppler echocardiographic studies. In addition, 10 underwent angiography six, a computed tomographic scan
