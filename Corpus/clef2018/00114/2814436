Transthoracic color Doppler echocardiography in the diagnosis of insufficiency of heart valve prostheses. A comparison with conventional Doppler sonography. Color-coded and conventional pulsed wave/continuous wave Doppler detection of valvular or paravalvular regurgitation in 59 patients with 67 cardiac valve prostheses were compared 21 patients had known regurgitation determined by auscultation. Analysis of the color-coded Doppler findings was made from videotape and blinded as to patient identity and clinical findings. Conventional Doppler Sonography detected 36 instances of aortic and 3 of mitral prosthetic regurgitation. Color-coded Doppler investigation detected 27 instances of aortic and 1 of mitral prosthetic regurgitation resulting in a sensitivity of 72% and specificity of 100% as compared to conventional Doppler sonography. All 21 patients with a regurgitant murmur had pathological conventional Doppler findings, but 3 of them did not show regurgitant flow in the color-coded Doppler examination. The apical four chamber view contributed most to the colour-coded Doppler detection of regurgitant flow, followed by the parasternal long axis view.
