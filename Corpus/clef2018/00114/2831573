Abdominal real-time sonography in patients with vascular prostheses. 100 sonograms were performed in 71 patients up to 13 years (average 21.8 months) after various surgical interventions of the abdominal aorta. Patients were examined e.g. for complications in the early postoperative stage or abnormal local findings and during clinical follow-ups. Ultrasound showed e.g. 13 aneurysms of grafts and anastomoses, 19 haematomas, 4 lymphoceles, 3 graft occlusions and 2 graft infections. Beyond the implantation site in 45 sonograms additional pathological findings were demonstrated, which were unknown in 13 patients (e.g. renal carcinoma, liver metastases, hydronephrosis). In patients with aortic grafts real-time sonography of the abdomen can be regarded as a relatively easily performed, valuable method.
