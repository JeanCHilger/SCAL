The rapid evolution of a large mycotic aneurysm of the abdominal aorta. Computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography (US) have been shown to be effective, noninvasive methods for the detection of established mycotic aortic aneurysms. We report a patient in whom CT and US were performed immediately before and after the development of a large mycotic abdominal aortic aneurysm, providing a unique opportunity to observe its rapid evolution.
