Aortobifemoral perigraft abscess: treatment by percutaneous catheter drainage. There is significant morbidity and mortality associated with infected prosthetic aortic grafts. The preferred method of treatment is excision of the involved graft and revascularization. Percutaneous catheter drainage of abscesses under CT scanning or ultrasound guidance has been shown to be an effective alternative to surgery. This is a case of a patient with a retroperitoneal abscess involving the femoral limb of an aortobifemoral bypass graft, which was successfully treated by percutaneous catheter drainage. In selected high-risk patients this may be a safe alternative to surgical therapy.
