Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm. Most abdominal aortic aneurysms are asymptomatic, but rupture is usually fatal. Elective surgery is now a relatively safe procedure, even in the elderly. Screening to identify those harbouring an aneurysm may allow preventive surgery to be offered. To be cost-effective a population at particular risk must be selected and factors predisposing to aneurysm formation include advancing age, hypertension, arteriosclerosis and family history. The screening technique selected should be acceptable to the population, accurate and rapid. Clinical examination and abdominal radiography are both less accurate than ultrasound examination by experienced personnel. Preliminary studies have confirmed a reasonable diagnostic rate.
