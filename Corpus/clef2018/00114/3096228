Ultrasonic detection of arteriosclerosis of the main arterial trunks in the coronary patient. Ultrasonic investigations of the peripheral vessels (continuous Doppler with spectral analysis, echotomography) were performed to evaluate atherosclerosis of the main arteries (abdominal aorta, cervical arteries, lower limb arteries) in 50 coronary patients and 40 control subjects. In the main, our results support those of previously published series (epidemiological and autopsy studies): Atherosclerosis of the main arterial vessels is significantly more common (p less than 0.01) in coronary patients than in control subjects: carotid lesions: 70% (including 10% with severe stenosis) compared to 32% (no severe stenosis) aortic lesions: 50% (including 20% with severe stenosis) compared to 17.5% (7.5% severe stenosis)
