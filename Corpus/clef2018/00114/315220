Late results of extra-anatomic bypass. Clinical progress and results were reviewed in 100 consecutive patients who underwent extra-anatomic bypass procedures for brachiocephalic and aortoiliac occlusive disease during the past 15 years. Of 113 procedures in this group, extra-anatomic bypass of the brachiocephalic vessels, axillo-femoral bypass, and femorofemoral bypass were performed. Although these procedures were performed in high-risk patients to avoid intrathoracic and intra-abdominal reconstruction or to circumvent undesirable anatomic areas, a low operative mortality was achieved. Symptomatic improvement, augmented Doppler ankle pressure index, and high limb-salvage rate were noted. Life-table analysis has confirmed prolonged five-year graft patency. The suspected high-risk characteristic in this group was corroborated by high progressive mortality observed particularly after axillo-femoral bypass and was due primarily to the severity of associated diseases. Analysis of the late results of extraanatomic bypass confirms the safety and effectiveness of this procedure in poor-risk patients.
