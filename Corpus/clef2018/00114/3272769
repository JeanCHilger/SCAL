Analysis of Doppler-obtained velocity curves in functional evaluation of mechanical prosthetic valves in the mitral and aortic positions. A total of 145 patients with 160 mechanical prostheses of the Bj√∂rk-Shiley or Starr-Edwards type (15 with double mitral plus aortic valves) underwent clinical and Doppler echocardiography analysis. In the mitral position (85 valves) 10 patients with valve-related symptoms, calculated prosthetic area less than or equal to 1 cm2, or mean transprosthetic gradient greater than 10 mm Hg by Doppler echocardiography were predefined as abnormal. Seven patients had operations, and prosthetic obstruction was confirmed in all. All patients had higher pulmonary pressures (p less than 0.001) before valve replacement. Clinical presentation was variable however, all those with proved prosthetic thrombosis had a fulminant course and distinctive velocity curves on Doppler. In the 75 patients predefined as normal, calculated valve area (2.3 +/- 0.6 cm2, mean +/- SD, range 1.3 to 3.7 cm2) and mean gradient (4.9 +/- 1.7 mm Hg, range 1.5 to 9.5 mm Hg) were widely spread and were independent of prosthetic size greater than or equal to 27 mm. Clinically 37 of 75 patients were moderately to severely limited. Mean gradient above 5 mm Hg was associated with a higher incidence of chronic atrial fibrillation (p less than 0.05), significant tricuspid regurgitation, failure of the right side of the heart, and significant functional limitation (p less than 0.02 for all). In the aortic position (75 valves) peak gradients were 28.2 +/- 15 mm Hg (8 to 80 mm Hg). Mean gradients were 18 +/- 9.6 mm Hg (6.5 to 46.5 mm Hg). Averaged gradients derived from the average of peak and late systolic gradients were 22.4 +/- 12.7 mm Hg (6 to 62 mm Hg). In all five abnormal patients (two with endocarditis and three with hemodynamic decompensation) but also in 18 of 70 clinically normal valves, peak gradients were greater than or equal to 36 mm Hg (ranges 36 to 65 mm Hg in both). Gradients were unrelated to symptoms or to the duration of the valve in situ (3 weeks to 20 years). Gradients correlated with prosthetic size (r = 0.57) and were higher (p less than 0.001) across small (19 to 23 mm) versus large (25 to 31 mm) valves. Regurgitation was present in 40% of the mitral prostheses. It was detected in 32% of the mitral prostheses defined as normal and was estimated as mild in most. Aortic regurgitation was present in all five abnormal aortic prostheses, significant in four, and in 26 of the valves (37%) defined as normal, significant in two.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
