Evaluation of Björk-Shiley prosthetic valves by real-time two-dimensional Doppler echocardiographic flow mapping. We studied the value of two-dimensional Doppler echocardiographic color flow mapping for identifying normal transvalve flow profiles and valve malfunction in 20 patients with Björk-Shiley prosthetic valves. Seven patients had Björk-Shiley prosthetic valves in the aortic position alone, seven in the mitral position, and six had prosthetic valves in both the aortic and mitral positions. In 10 patients with normally functioning mitral valves, the ratios of the maximal major and minor Doppler-imaged orifice flow diameters to the valve ring diameters were 25 +/- 3% (mean +/- SD) and 24 +/- 3%, respectively, similar to values reported in in vitro studies. No mitral regurgitation was found in these patients by two-dimensional Doppler echocardiographic flow mapping or by spectral Doppler. Of the 10 clinically normal aortic Björk-Shiley valves, no valvular regurgitation was found by color flow mapping, whereas mild aortic regurgitation was found in two patients with the use of spectral Doppler. Malfunction of six valves was documented in five patients and was confirmed by cardiac catheterization and/or surgery. These included one case of focal fibrous ingrowth involving primarily the minor orifice of a mitral prosthetic valve, one case of mitral valve prosthetic thrombosis with decreased major and minor orifice flow diameters and valvular regurgitation, and four cases of paravalvular regurgitation involving prosthetic valves in the aortic position (three patients) and the mitral position (one patient). Two-dimensional Doppler echocardiographic flow mapping provides new observations that may aid in identifying Björk-Shiley prosthetic valve malfunction. By localizing precisely the site of prosthetic stenosis or regurgitation, it may also assist in defining the cause of valve malfunction.
