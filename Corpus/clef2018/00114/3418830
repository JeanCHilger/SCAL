Anastomotic false aneurysms of the abdominal aorta and the iliac arteries. Anastomotic false aneurysm (AFA) of the aorta or iliac artery is a potentially lethal complication of prosthetic grafts. To study this complication, the records of 18 patients with 22 noninfected AFAs (15 aortic and seven iliac) were reviewed. Patients with an intact AFA had a pulsatile abdominal mass, abdominal pain, an occluded graft, peripheral emboli, or a femoral anastomotic false aneurysm. All patients with a ruptured AFA were in shock, but 67% (four of six) had symptoms before hemorrhage. For diagnosis, single-plane angiography was 69% accurate (11 of 16), computed tomography was 100% accurate (six of six), and ultrasound was used once and suggested an AFA. Three patients with an AFA less than 5 cm diameter were initially observed however, all three aneurysms rapidly enlarged and one ruptured. The operative mortality rate was 8% (1 of 12) for patients with an intact aneurysm and 67% (four of six) for patients with a ruptured aneurysm. Treatment was resection of the AFA and replacement with a new graft. Retroperitoneal AFAs often appear years after the initial operation, and life-long follow-up is required for patients with an aortic or iliac graft. All retroperitoneal AFAs should be resected since the outcome of patients with a ruptured AFA is poor.
