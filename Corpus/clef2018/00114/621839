Ultrasonic evaluation of pulsatile abdominal masses. Gray scale ultrasound B-mode scanning provides a rapid and safe method for evaluating the origin of a pulsatile midline abdominal mass. In those patients who do not have an aortic aneurysm, ultrasound will frequently provide another explanation. Tortuous aortas, pancreatic pseudocysts, metastatic cancers, lymphomas, and low-lying livers may all present as pulsatile masses clinically mimicking an aortic aneurysm. Visualization of the para-aortic soft tissues as well as the aorta allows these conditions to be distinguished by abdominal ultrasound.
