Revascularization of the distal vertebral artery (3d segment). Indications in the treatment of vertebrobasilar insufficiency. This article reviews 11 cases of distal revascularization of the extracranial vertebral artery above C2. Revascularization was indicated in 7 cases of extensive atheromatous stenotic or occlusive lesions, 3 cases of dissecting aneurysm, and one case of cervical malformation of the vertebral artery. The procedure of choice was a venous graft - in the C1/C2 space in 10 cases and above C1 in the eleventh. Doppler tests, ultrasound and arteriography demonstrated the patency of all the bypasses, and this was confirmed, 6 months to 3 years postoperatively, by Doppler and ultrasound. No neurological anomalies were observed either during the postoperative course or subsequently. The satisfactory results obtained would seem to justify extension of indications to include the treatment of atheromatous lesions of the supra-aortic trunks, and also adjacent vascular tumors (vertebral bone tumors, or complex cervical malformations of the vertebral artery).
