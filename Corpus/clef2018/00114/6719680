Percutaneous drainage of abscesses and fluid collections. Percutaneous drainage has rapidly become the initial procedure of choice in the treatment of most intra-abdominal abscesses. The retroperitoneal location of the urinary tract facilitates a percutaneous approach and has been found to be highly effective, with surgical intervention required in a minority of cases. Noninfected fluid collections, particularly those related to ureteral or renal pelvic injuries, may also be managed nonsurgically using percutaneous techniques, such as nephrostomy and antegrade stenting.
