Complications relating to vascular prosthetic grafts. Arteriography remains the definitive radiologic procedure for diagnosing complications of vascular prosthetic grafting. Gray scale B-mode ultrasonography is well suited for detection of false aneurysms, abscesses, and hematomas. The gastrointestinal series is of limited value in assessing most grafts. In non emergent cases, excretory urography may provide useful diagnostic information as well as determine the location of the kidneys and ureters preoperatively. Computed tomography may aid in demonstrating and following the course of postoperative hematomas it may also be valuable in demonstrating periprosthetic abscess. A strategy is suggested for selecting the appropriate method of evaluating vascular prosthetic grafts.
