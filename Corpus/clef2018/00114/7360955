Ultrasonography of the iliac arteries. Ultrasound is an effective means of evaluating the iliac arteries, especially in (a) patients with aortofemoral grafts, who are subject to false aneurysm, hematoma, and abscess and (b) elderly patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms who are at greater risk for iliac aneurysms. While iliac aneurysms are uncommon, recognition is essential, since the complications of rupture are lethal.
