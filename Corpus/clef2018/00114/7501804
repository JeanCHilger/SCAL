Color-coded duplex ultrasound in chronic dissecting abdominal aortic aneurysm. Differentiation between true and false aortic lumen with reference to the blood supply to larger abdominal arteries. This study was carried out to evaluate the ability of color-coded duplex sonography (CCDS) to differentiate between true and false aortic lumen with regard to the blood supply to the major aortic branches in cases of chronic dissecting abdominal aortic aneurysm.In eight patients with aortic dissection, the Doppler spectrum was analyzed for maximum systolic velocity (Vmax), pulsatility index (PI), acceleration time (AT), acceleration index (HAN-DA index, AI), and, in renal arteries, for the side ratio of AT and AI (AT-R, AI-R). Computerized tomography and angiography were used to define blood supply to the aortic branches by true and false aortic lumen.Four of five iliac arteries with continued dissection showed differences between true and false lumen in all Doppler parameters one showed no difference. In the remaining iliac arteries and the viseral branches, blood supply by true or false aortic lumen could not be differentiated by CCDS.In cases of chronic dissecting abdominal aortic aneurysm, CCDS is not able to differentiate between true and false aortic lumen with regard to the blood supply to the major aortic branches.
