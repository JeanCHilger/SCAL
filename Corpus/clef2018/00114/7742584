Analysis of functional abnormalities uncovered during preoperative evaluation of donor candidates for living-related liver transplantation. Functional abnormalities of the liver uncovered during preoperative routine evaluation were analyzed in 109 donor candidates for 100 cases of living-related liver transplantation (LRLT) performed during the period from June, 1990 to May, 1994 at the Second Department of Surgery, Kyoto University Hospital. High serum transaminase (GOT, GPT) levels were noted in 10 (9.2%) cases among 109 candidates, high alkaline phosphatase in 4 (3.7%), hyperbilirubinemia in 3 (2.8%), anemia in 3 and high choline esterase in 3 cases. Positive hepatitis C antibody (HCV) was also noted in 1 case. Fatty liver was detected in 10 (9.2%) cases, cholecystitis in 2 cases, 1 case each of cyst and calcification in the liver by diagnostic imaging (ultra sonograph and/or computed tomography). These abnormalities of the liver necessitated replacing the initial candidate with the other parent in 9 cases, including 1 case without any functional abnormality whose graft liver was too large to fit the recipient abdominal cavity. There were 14 cases of ABO blood type incompatible combination. Switching the initial candidate due to these abnormalities mentioned above resulted in incompatible combinations in 4 of these 14 cases. Although the advantages of the LRLT are the superior viability of the donor graft and the genetic histocompatibility between recipient and donor, to optimize the advantage of LRLT, all donor candidates should be strongly advised to make every effort preoperatively to improve their physical condition in preparation for the LRLT protocol, since many of these abnormalities are typically reversible.
