Principles of quantitative color Doppler ultrasound of pelvic and leg arteries. Normal sample. Statistical analysis of a group of 25 healthy individuals, examined via angiodynography, shows a large range of scatter for all measured parameters in pelvic and lower extremity arteries. Blood flow and velocity values, systolic acceleration and vessel diameter decrease whereas the pulsatility index rises from the centre towards the periphery. Problem areas for morphological and quantitative evaluation are the abdominal aorta, pelvic vessels, superficial femoral artery in the distal adductor canal and the fibular artery. Nearly all vessels showed tri- or multiphasic spectral patterns. Biphasic waveform, however, may be normal in lower extremity arteries. The data yielded by colour-coded Doppler sonography were comparable to results obtained with other procedures.
