Kidney transplantation in patients more than 60 years old. Analysis of results apropos of 57 patients. From April 1988 to August 1993, 57 elderly recipients more than 60 years old (mean age 64 +/- 3 years, 35 males, 22 females) underwent cadaveric renal transplantation. The pretransplant screening included immunological and viral status and urological examination cardiovascular risk factors were systematically estimated by medical history, physical examination, echocardiography, femoral arterial doppler, and myocardial stress thallium imaging. A coronarography was performed if myocardial ischemia was evidenced. Patients free of cardiovascular diseases or after correction of vascular and/or coronary lesions were included in the waiting list. A sequential immunosuppression regimen including azathioprine, prednisolone anad antilymphocyte globulins was given in all patients. Oral cyclosporin A (5-8 mg/kg/day) was started when serum creatinine level decreased to 200 mumol/l
