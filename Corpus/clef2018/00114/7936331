Recurrent aneurysmal disease of the native arteries in subjects operated on for abdominal aortic aneurysm. Abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs are presently increasing in number all over the western countries long life expectancy and high quality of life, warranted to patients surviving operation, stressed the possibility that aneurysmal disease affects other arteries as well as the para-anastomotic aorta itself. OBJECTIVE. The observation that, in the last four years, five patients were operated on for recurrent aneurysms of native arteries, gives the opportunity to discuss the matter and review the literature on this topic. MATERIAL AND METHODS. Five cases of recurrent aneurysms of native arteries in patients that had undergone abdominal aortic aneurysmectomy 4 to 11 (mean: 8) years before are discussed. A total of 16 new aneurysms were found. Although all these patients regularly attended their clinical follow-up program, these observations have to be considered retrospective and incidental, because B-mode echography was not yet routinely requested by the followup protocol. RESULTS. Neither hypertension nor type of graft implanted in the first operation were correlated to the development of new aneurysms in these five subjects. Rupture as causative of the original aneurysmectomy was recorded in two cases (40%), that developed 8 recurrent aneurysms (50%), one of which ruptured. CONCLUSIONS. Although recurrent aneurysms are occasionally reported in the literature, the lack of prospective follow-up series, based on non invasive serial imaging of the arterial system, prevents clarifying whether these observations are isolated or recurrence is likely to be a long-term outcome of aneurysmal disease.
