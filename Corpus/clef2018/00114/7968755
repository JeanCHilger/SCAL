Endoluminal repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms. To review the outcome of endoluminal repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm.Twelve patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (mean diameter, 5 cm range, 4.4-7.8 cm) were selected according to strict criteria relating to the morphology of the aneurysm and iliac arteries. The aneurysms all had a proximal neck between the renal arteries and the aneurysm and a distal neck between the aneurysm and the bifurcation of the aorta. The iliac arteries were not tortuous and were 8 mm or greater in diameter.The aneurysm was repaired with a graft stent device introduced into the aorta via a sheath in the femoral artery.Successful endoluminal repair was achieved in 10 of 12 patients (83%). The two patients in whom the endoluminal repair was abandoned were treated by standard open repair. All patients have since had an aortogram and duplex ultrasound examination to confirm exclusion of the aneurysm from the general circulation (mean period of follow-up, seven months). There have been no deaths.Abdominal aortic aneurysms conforming to strict morphological criteria can be treated safely and successfully by this minimally invasive endoluminal method.
