Doppler echocardiography in normal functioning valve prostheses. Even though there has been some criticism regarding the Doppler evaluation in prosthetic valves because of inter-observer and intra-observer variability, among other factors, and Doppler study has a tendency to have falsely high gradients compared to invasive studies, especially mechanical aortic prostheses, Doppler evaluation can provide reliable hemodynamic information about valve function. This test may be particularly useful if used serially, when baseline values are known. Doppler measurement of gradient and valve area has an expected normal range that is specific for the prosthetic type, size, anatomical position, and chronological age. Clearly, a database involving these aspects is needed to provide a more accurate normal range. This study is intended to provide guidance for echocardiographers.
