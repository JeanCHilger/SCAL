Long-term clinical outcome with small size Standard St Jude Medical valves implanted in the aortic position. Records of 144 patients who received size 19 or 21 mm (Group A) aortic Standard St. Jude Medical (SSJM) prostheses were retrospectively reviewed and compared to 219 patients who received size 25 mm SSJM valves (Group B). Group A patients were older (70 +/- 9 years vs. 62 +/- 13 years) and had smaller body surface area (BSA) (1.65 m2 vs. 1.9 m2 p < 0.05). Operative mortality (5% vs. 2%) and postoperative unadjusted Doppler mean gradient (31 mmHg vs. 22 mmHg) were higher in Group A (p < 0.05). Total follow up was 1255 patient-years (450.6 Group A/804.4 Group B). There were no perivalvular leaks, valve thrombosis, or endocarditis in either group. Freedom from thromboembolism and anticoagulant-related hemorrhage was 89% and 95% in Group A and 93% and 98% in Group B, respectively. The major causes of late death were older age and progressive cardiac disease. The five-year actuarial analysis revealed a survival rate of 74% in Group A and 83% in Group B (p < 0.05). Of those who were alive, more than 70% were in functional class I and II. These patients not only enjoy a complication-free living but are able to perform daily routine activity despite being older. 19 mm and 21 mm SSJM aortic valve prostheses had higher transprosthetic gradient, but provided satisfactory performance in adult patients with a BSA of less than 1.7 m2. This valve can be used in the small aortic annulus with a valve size index of at least 12 mm/m2 as an alternative to an annular enlargement procedure.
