Modern imaging of atheromatous aneurysms of the abdominal aorta. Radiologic imaging advances, during the last decade, deeply modified diagnosis, follow up and preoperative staging of aortic abdominal atheromatous aneurysms. When congenital, infectious and inflammatory aneurysms are rare, atheroma is the most frequent etiology of aneurysms. Ultrasonography is actually very reliable for aneurysms diagnosis. Inexpensive, it is the best exam for early screening in a risk population (arterial hypertension). If ultrasonography is adequate for diagnosis and follow up, two tests are necessary for pretherapeutic staging: arteriography and computed tomography (CT). CT is more accurate than ultrasonography. It is realized just after arteriography without any other contrast media injection. Angiography of aorta and limbs vessels shows the whole arterial system and allows the adaptation of surgical procedure. IRM is more expansive and less accessible, it has not proved it superiority versus CT. It is realized only when CT is unwise (allergy, renal failure). Helicoidal CT will be in the future the best exam to study the whole vascular system and will probably take the place of arteriography and CT.
