Late complications after aortic surgery. The incidence of false aneurysms, anastomotic stenoses, and ureteric obstruction is reported to be low in patients who have undergone aortic surgery. The use of intravenous peripheral digital subtraction angiography (IVDSA) with completion excretory urography (CEU) may provide a more sensitive means of long-term detection of these complications. The aim of this study was to (1) establish the incidence of anastomotic aneurysms, anastomotic stenoses, and ureteric obstruction after aortic surgery (2) identify local and systemic factors that predispose to these complications
