Innovations in vascular imaging: arteriography, three-dimensional CT scans, and two- and three-dimensional intravascular ultrasound evaluation of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. This report compares the information obtained from arteriography, CT scans, and intravascular ultrasound evaluation of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The two- and three-dimensional imaging techniques described in this report add information that is redefining the pre- and intraoperative analysis of arterial lesions. The new data may have an influence on the evolution of diagnostic methods and future interventional therapy for vascular disease. This case highlights the developing potential of the methods.
