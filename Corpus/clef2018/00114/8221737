Anterograde and retrograde cardioplegia in myocardial revascularization. An intraoperative contrast echographic study. The aim of this study was to assess the distribution of antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia with intraoperative contrast echocardiography in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. Fifteen patients with chronic stable angina pectoris and severe coronary artery disease were studied. The severity of coronary artery disease was assessed at coronary angiography, using the Jeopardy Score System. The presence and the extent of collateral circulation was evaluated on the basis of preoperative coronary angiography and graded as: absent or poor good or excellent. Coronary revascularization was carried out during extracorporeal circulation and myocardial protection was performed with antegrade (aortic root) and retrograde (right atrial) cardioplegia. The echo contrast agent was sterilely prepared 1 hour prior to surgery and consisted of a solution of sonicated 5% human albumin microbubbles. Two ml of sonicated albumin were injected along with antegrade cardioplegia and 4 ml with retrograde cardioplegia. The echocardiographic images were obtained with transesophageal echocardiography in the transgastric left ventricular short-axis view. Images were recorded on videotape for off-line planimetric measurement of percent myocardial opacification. Data were analyzed with the analysis of variance. Multiple comparisons were made with Student's paired t test and using Bonferroni's correction. Myocardial opacification was 58.9 +/- 12.9% during antegrade cardioplegia and 77.5 +/- 16.4% during retrograde cardioplegia (p = 0.003). This overall difference was mainly due to the impact of collateral circulation in the distribution of antegrade cardioplegia. Patients with absent or poor collateral circulation showed a lower degree of myocardial opacification than patients with good or excellent myocardial opacification (44.3 +/- 12.0% versus 64.2 +/- 8.6%
