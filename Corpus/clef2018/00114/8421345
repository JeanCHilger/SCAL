Mesenteric duplex scanning: a blinded prospective study. Based on retrospective comparisons of duplex scanning with arteriography of the celiac (CA) and superior mesenteric (SMA) arteries in 34 patients, we previously suggested that an SMA peak systolic velocity of 275 cm/sec or greater or no flow signal and a CA PSV of 200 cm/sec or greater or no flow signal were reliable indicators of a 70% or greater angiographic stenosis of the SMA and CA, respectively. We now report the results of a blinded, prospective study in a larger patient group designed to determine the ability of mesenteric duplex scanning to visualize the CA and SMA and to validate our proposed duplex criteria for splanchnic artery stenosis.During an 18-month period 100 patients admitted to our vascular surgery service for aortography underwent routine mesenteric artery duplex scanning and lateral abdominal aortography regardless of abdominal symptoms. The lateral aortograms were evaluated to determine the presence or absence of a 70% or greater stenosis in the CA or SMA. Duplex-determined peak systolic velocities from the CA and SMA were recorded without knowledge of the angiographic results.Aortography satisfactorily visualized 100% of the CAs and 99% of the SMAs. Of these, 93% of the SMAs and 83% of the CAs were visualized by duplex. According to the above criteria, duplex sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and overall accuracy for detection of a 70% or greater SMA stenosis were 92%, 96%, 80%, 99%, and 96% and for a 70% or greater CA stenosis 87%, 80%, 63%, 94%, and 82%.Mesenteric duplex scanning is feasible in the majority of patients. Prospective evaluation of duplex diagnostic criteria for 70% or greater stenosis indicates that mesenteric duplex scanning is sufficiently accurate to be clinically useful as a screening examination to detect SMA and CA stenosis.
