Cineradiography for determination of normal and abnormal function in mechanical heart valves. To determine the diagnostic value of cineradiography of mechanical heart valves, 112 cinefluoroscopic studies were performed in 76 patients with 95 valve prostheses (caged ball or disk valves, tilting disk and bileaflet valves). A patient group (n = 45) presenting with clinical or echocardiographic findings suggestive of valve-related complications was compared with a control group (n = 31) without such symptoms. Disk-opening angles (mean +/- SD) for Medtronic Hall aortic valves were found to be significantly smaller (62.8 +/- 11.1 degrees) in patients than in control subjects (73.9 +/- 1.6 degrees p < 0.05). Tissue ingrowth or thrombus formation, or both, demonstrated in 3 patients on subsequent reoperation, are considered as the main cause of incomplete or asymmetric disk opening. Opening and closing times did not differ significantly between patients and control subjects. Besides abnormal valve motion, structural defects such as strut fracture or leaflet escape could be rapidly detected by cineradiography if x-ray projections according to the particular valve design were used. Together with quantitative Doppler echocardiographic and clinical data, this method can help to give specific answers if the question is to either confirm or exclude imminent or acute valve malfunction. Thus, modern cineradiography is a highly valuable noninvasive diagnostic tool for both rapid management of emergency cases and routine follow-up of patients with mechanical heart valves.
