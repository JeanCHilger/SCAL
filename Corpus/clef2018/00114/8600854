Is routine carotid screening for coronary surgery needed? An association between carotid and coronary artery disease is well recognized. Routine preoperative duplex carotid screening of all coronary surgery patients is common, but may delay surgery and increase cost. To evaluate such a policy: A retrospective review of the records of 308 consecutive patients undergoing coronary surgery at one hospital was performed. Duplex studies were done on 210. A history of TIA/RIND, CVA, AS-PVD, AAA, neck bruit, or prior carotid surgery was considered suggestive for carotid disease. The history and/or physical exam (HPE) suggested carotid disease in 114 37 of these (32%) had a positive scan. Of 96 patients without +HPE, three (3%) had a significant stenosis. A prospective study of cardiac surgery patients was done, categorized into "carotid" (n = 33) or "no-carotid" (n = 50) disease by two independent observers, based on +HPE. Positive scans were found in 27 per cent of the "carotid disease" group
