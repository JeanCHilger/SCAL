"Kissing-balloon" technique for abdominal aorta angioplasty. Initial results and long term outcome. We evaluated results after angioplasty of the distal abdominal aorta using "kissing-balloon" technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS. From 1981 through 1993, 14 patients (12 women and 2 men, average age 52.4 years), underwent balloon angioplasty of the distal segment of the abdominal aorta. In 8 patients stenosis involved one or both iliac arteries as well. In all cases double balloon technique was used. Follow-up was based on clinical, angiographical and duplex scanning examinations. RESULTS. The initial success rate was 85% (12/14). In one case there was residual stenosis of 20% (redilated successfully 1 month later), and in one case there was acute thrombosis of the right iliac artery (successfully relieved surgically). Long-term follow-up (6-143 months) showed good patency of the dilated segment in all patients (including patients that initially failed). At follow-up, all patients were asymptomatic. CONCLUSION. Dilatation of the distal abdominal aorta using "kissing-balloon" technique is a safe and efficient modality of treatment, with acceptable initial and excellent long-term results.
