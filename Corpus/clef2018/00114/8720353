Coarctation of the abdominal aorta. When a 27-year-old woman went to her general practitioner with symptoms of acute gastroenteritis he noted a paraumbilical murmur on auscultation. There were no symptoms of intermittent claudication or abdominal angina. All peripheral pulses were easily palpable and bilaterally equal, and there were no vascular murmurs. Physical examination and blood pressure (140/70 mm Hg bilaterally) were normal.Biochemical tests gave no indication of inflammatory disease. Oscillography showed a brief decrease in amplitude after muscular exertion, predominantly of the thigh. Posterior tibial systolic pressure was 20 mm Hg lower than radial pressure on the right, 25 mm Hg on the left. Colour Doppler sonography demonstrated elongated and looping coarctation of the abdominal aorta.As the patient had no symptoms only regular follow-up was indicated. There have been no symptoms for 27 months and no progression of the coarctation.In young patients with the described symptoms abdominal coarctation should be included in the differential diagnosis.
