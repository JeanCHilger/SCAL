Echocardiographic evaluation of hemodynamic function of CarboMedics heart valve in the aortic position in patients with small aortic annuli. Hemodynamic parameter of CarboMedics heart valve in the aortic position was evaluated using Doppler echocardiography in 46 patients with small aortic annuli. The size of prosthetic valve were 19 mm in 6 cases, 21 mm in 15 and 23 mm in 25. In patients with 19 mm valve, trans-valvular peak pressure gradient was 42.2 +/- 11.8 mmHg, mean pressure gradient was 17.3 +/- 9.3 mmHg, and left ventricular systolic pressure was 174 +/- 12 mmHg. These values were significantly larger than those of the other two groups. Effective orifice area index, discharge coefficient, doppler velocity index and stroke volume showed no significant difference among each group. After aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis, left ventricular mass decreased to around 70% of preoperative value in all groups, but significant left ventricular hypertrophy remained at two years postoperatively. We conclude that hemodynamic performance of CarboMedics heart valve in the aortic position was satisfactory, although 19 mm valve seemed to be fairly small for adult patients and deliberate patient selection is necessary.
