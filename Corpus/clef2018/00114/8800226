Deployment technique and histopathological evaluation of an endoluminal vascular prosthesis used to repair an iliac artery aneurysm. To describe the deployment technique, function, and gross healing of an endoluminal vascular prosthesis deployed in a high-risk patient for treatment of a common iliac artery (CIA) aneurysm.An 82-year-old, high-risk male with a 4-cm-diameter CIA aneurysm approximately 4.5 to 5 cm long was treated with endoluminal exclusion of the lesion using a 6-cm-long, 14-mm-internal diameter Dacron vascular prosthesis with Palmaz 308 stents sutured to either end of the graft. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging facilitated sizing of the endograft and its accurate positioning so as to occlude both the aneurysm and the hypogastric artery, which was a potential source of retrograde flow to the aneurysm. Exclusion of the lesion and occlusion of the hypogastric artery were demonstrated on delayed angiographic images and contrast computed tomography scans obtained at 16 days postprocedure. Unfortunately, the patient died 67 days following implantation from a nonprocedure-related gastrointestinal complication.At autopsy, the aortoiliac segment was excised and examined grossly and histologically the evaluation confirmed complete isolation of the aneurysm by the fully expanded endoluminal prosthesis. The surface of the vascular graft was covered by a glistening, thin, fibrinous membrane. The graft material was filled with hypocellular compact fibrinous material with no evidence of endothelialization. These observations confirm preliminary sealing and isolation of the iliac artery aneurysm as healing of the endograft progressed.The data acquired from the analysis of this specimen provide information regarding the utility and early healing of an endograft used for iliac artery aneurysm exclusion. This case also exemplifies the utility of IVUS in endograft deployment.
