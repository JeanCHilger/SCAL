Homograft replacement of aortic valve and ascending aorta. From May 1990 through December 1994, integral valved aortic homografts were implanted for replacement of the aortic valve and of part or the whole of the ascending aorta in 24 patients with a mean age of 45.5 years (17-66 years). Ten patients (41.7%) had infective endocarditis of the aortic valve (4 of the native valve and 6 prosthetic). Seven of these had root abscesses (70%), one with a fistula to the right atrium, resulting in a variable degree of discontinuity between the left ventricle and the aorta. Twelve patients (50%) had ascending aortic aneurysms and the remaining two (8.3%) had aortic dissection. Three patients (12.5%) also had mitral pathology, one had triple vessel coronary disease, one had aortic coarctation and another one had a sub-aortic membrane. Two thirds of the patients were in NYHA class III/IV and 10 (41.7%) had moderate or severe left ventricular dysfunction. A modified Bentall technique utilising fresh aortic homografts was used in all patients. The homografts were harvested aseptically from donors with a mean age of 30 years (16-54 years) and preserved at 4 degrees C for a period of 1-43 days (median-13 days). Six patients (25%) had associated surgery: mitral valve replacement mitral valvuloplasty with a ring
