The midterm evolution in the percutaneous closure of ductus arteriosus with the Rashkind prosthesis. Background percutaneous PDA occlusion has been proposed as a valid therapeutic alternative to surgical closure. Between April 1990 and July 1994, 44 patients underwent percutaneous PDA occlusion. Thirteen patients were less than 18 months old and weighed 8.7 +/- 3.2 Kg (Group I). Thirty-one patients, older than 18 months of age, had a mean weight of 36.8 +/- 20.6 Kg (Group II). Four patients in group I and two in group II had associated cardiac anomalies Residual shunt after percutaneous occlusion was studied by color Doppler. Fifty-one occluding devices were used. Forty-nine were implanted and there were two device embolizations. Twelve devices were implanted in group I. One device needed surgical removal from the right ventricle where it had embolized. In group II, 31 devices were implanted and one embolized to the descending aorta and was percutaneously removed through the femoral artery sheath. In two patients of group I and four of group II, a second device was implanted. The total occlusion rate immediately after implantation at 24 hours and at 6 months was 75%, 83% and 83% in group I and 64.5%, 77% and 84% in group II. After implantation of a second device the total occlusion rate without residual shunt reached 100% in group I (after 16 +/- 12 months follow-up) and 97% in group II (after 23 +/- 16 months of follow-up). We conclude that percutaneous ductal occlusion with a Rashkind device is a valid therapeutic alternative to surgical closure in all age groups.
