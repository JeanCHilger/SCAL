Successful balloon dilation of an abdominal coarctation of the aorta in patient with presumed Takayasu's aortitis. An 11-year-old male with a severe abdominal aortic coarctation, presumably secondary to aortitis, underwent successful percutaneous balloon dilation that resulted in near-complete relief of the obstruction. Intravascular ultrasound imaging showed a major endovascular tear immediately following dilation and satisfactorily excluded significant branch (superior mesenteric) artery compromise. Arterial remodeling was demonstrated with persistence of the gradient relief over a 12-month follow-up period.
