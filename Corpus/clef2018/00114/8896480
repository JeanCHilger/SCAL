Helical CT for the study of abdominal aortic aneurysms in patients undergoing conventional surgical repair. To evaluate the reliability of helical computed tomography (CT) as sole preoperative diagnostic technique for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) and to compare these results with the surgical findings.Thirty-three patients undergoing elective surgical repair.Helical CT, Doppler exam of lower limbs, digital angiography, in case of peripheral vascular disease, and intraoperative evaluation.Helical CT correctly detected, in all cases, the proximal and distal extent of the AAA. The coeliac axis and its branches, the superior mesenteric artery and renal vessels as well as the inferior vena cava were always clearly depicted, showing anatomical variants or pathological involvement in 14 patients (42.4%).Helical CT can be used as the sole method for preoperative imaging of AAA. It allows a complete and precise evaluation of size, extent and relationship of the AAA, the surrounding vessels and other abdominal structures.
