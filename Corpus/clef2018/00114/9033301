Hemodynamic performance of small aortic valve bioprostheses: is there a difference? There is the potential for left ventricular outflow obstruction when small aortic valve bioprostheses are employed in normal-sized or large adults. It has been hoped that bovine pericardial valves would improve hemodynamic performance in the smaller tissue valve sizes.To determine in vivo hemodynamic performance of heterograft aortic valve prostheses, we analyzed echocardiographic data from patients receiving 21- or 23-mm Carpentier-Edwards pericardial, Medtronic Intact, and Carpentier-Edwards porcine bioprostheses. In addition, data from 19-mm Carpentier-Edwards pericardial valves were included for comparison of hemodynamic performance between valve sizes. Doppler echocardiography was performed in 151 patients within 2 weeks of operation. Left ventricular outflow gradient was derived from continuous Doppler measurements of flow velocity, and effective orifice area was calculated by the continuity equation.There were statistically significant differences in hemodynamic performance of different sized prostheses for each valve type (effective orifice area, p < 0.01 valvular gradient, p < 0.03). There were, however, no significant differences in effective orifice area or mean gradient for different valve types within each size category.The in vivo hemodynamic performance of these three different aortic valve heterograft bioprostheses is similar. Patient-prosthesis mismatch with heterograft prostheses, as demonstrated by the indexed effective orifice area can be avoided by appropriate sizing and use of annular enlarging techniques when necessary.
