Co-morbidity in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm. Selection for surgery of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) depends on an assessment of risk from operation compared with risk from aneurysm rupture. A study was performed to assess the levels of co-morbidity and to see whether co-morbidity was different in people with a normal aorta after ultrasonographic examination than in those with an aneurysmal aorta.Over a two year period 5392 people (2341 men, 3051 women) aged 65-80 were screened using B-mode linear ultrasound, with maximum measurements taken of transverse, anteroposterior diameters, or both. All subjects were given a questionnaire seeking a history of angina, stroke, claudication, myocardial infarct, respiratory problems, and diabetes.218 men and women were found to have an AAA of 3 cm or greater. The results of the questionnaire were analysed using logistic regression whereby all the co-morbid conditions were adjusted for each other and for smoking, sex, and age. The only conditions which were significantly associated with AAA in both sexes were myocardial infarction with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.66 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06 to 2.60) and claudication with an OR of 1.68 (95% CI 1.17 to 2.42). The association between angina and AAA was of borderline significance (OR = 1.52, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.30). Stroke was significantly associated only in women, with an OR of 3.71 (95% CI 1.42 to 9.69). Rates of diabetes and respiratory disease were not significantly different between people with AAA and normal aortas.These findings show there is significantly higher co-morbidity in people with ultrasound detected AAA, which might influence outcome from surgery and long term survival.
