Evaluation of cryopreserved homografts in the right ventricular outflow tract after the Ross procedure: intermediate-term follow up. The Ross procedure involves replacing a transplanted pulmonary valve with a cryopreserved homograft in order to re-establish right ventricle-pulmonary artery continuity. This study reviews mid-term results of such surgery in children and young adults.Since November 1986, 114 patients have undergone the Ross procedure at the Children's Hospital of Oklahoma using cryopreserved pulmonary homografts (n = 113) and aortic homograft (n = 1) to reconstruct the right ventricular outflow tract. Graft size ranged from 16 to 32 mm. Ninety-three patients (mean age at implant 10.4 years (range: 0.8-22 years) have had complete mean follow up of 3.2 years (range: 5 months to 8.4 years) after surgery. Homograft evaluation included clinical reports and comparison of early post-implant and latest echocardiography. Measurements of homograft valve annulus and peak instantaneous Doppler gradient were compared quality of valve leaflets, location of obstruction, and the degree of pulmonary regurgitation were assessed.Compared with early postoperative data, mean homograft annulus size decreased by 15% (p < 0.0001) in 88% of patients, the decrease ranged from one to nine millimeter. Peak Doppler gradient increased significantly (from 10 to 17 mmHg, p < 0.0001)After the Ross procedure: (i) Pulmonary homografts undergo significant annular reduction in most patients, though this is usually not associated with the development of significant obstruction. (ii) Peak Doppler gradients across the homograft increase in most patients, though only 4% develop more than mild obstruction. (iii) Mild pulmonary regurgitation is common (20%) moderate or severe regurgitation is rare and usually develops in concert with severe stenosis. (iv) Severe homograft valve degeneration usually occurs within one year of implant, and may reflect an immune-mediated response.
