Dynamic properties of the aorta and of the foot microcirculation in adolescents with diabetes mellitus. To evaluate vascular function in diabetic subjects, we studied both the stiffness of the abdominal aorta and the foot microvascular reactivity in 22 diabetic adolescents and 18 controls. The aortic stiffness was significantly higher in diabetic females, but not in males, as compared to age- and gender-matched controls (p < 0.05). Foot post-ischaemic hyperaemia was lower in diabetic subjects than in controls (p < 0.05), while postural vasoconstriction did not differ between the groups. The microvascular reactivity did not correlate with the duration of diabetes, but seemed to be influenced by the insulin regimen. The degree of aortic stiffness and the microvascular reactivity of the foot were not significantly interrelated. Loss of aortic elasticity might be a long-term effect of diabetes, whereas microvascular reactivity seems to reflect the current influence of the metabolic state and insulin treatment.
