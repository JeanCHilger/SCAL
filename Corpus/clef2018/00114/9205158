Risk factors and solutions for the development of neurobehavioral changes after coronary artery bypass grafting. As operative mortality for coronary artery bypass grafting has decreased, greater attention has focused on neurobehavioral complications of coronary artery bypass grafting and cardiopulmonary bypass.To assess risk factors and to evaluate changes in surgical technique, between 1991 and 1994 we evaluated 395 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with an 11-part neurobehavioral battery administered preoperatively and at 1 and 6 weeks postoperatively. Patients were instrumented with 5-MHz focused continuous-wave carotid Doppler transducers intraoperatively to estimate cerebral microembolism as an instantaneous perturbation of the velocity signal. Microembolism data were quantitated and compared with surgical technical maneuvers during operation and with neurobehavioral deficit (> or = 20% decline from preoperative performance on two or more neurobehavioral tests) postoperatively. These data and patient demographics were statistically analyzed (chi2, t test) and the results at 2 years (1991 and 1992 group A) were used to influence surgical technique in 1993 and 1994 (group B).Significantly associated with new neurobehavioral deficits were increasing patient age (p < 0.05), more than 100 emboli per case (p < 0.04), and palpable aortic plaque (p < 0.02). Group B patients had a significant decline in the neurobehavioral event rate (group A, 69%, 140/203 versus group B, 60%, 115/192Neurobehavioral changes after coronary artery bypass grafting are common and associated with cerebral microembolization. Surgical technical maneuvers designed to reduce emboli production may improve neurobehavioral outcome.
