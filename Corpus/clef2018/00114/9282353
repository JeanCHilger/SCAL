Normal echocardiographic characteristics of the Sorin Bicarbon bileaflet prosthetic heart valve in the mitral and aortic positions. Doppler echocardiographic characteristics of normally functioning Sorin Bicarbon prostheses were prospectively assessed in 226 consecutive patients (135 male and 91 female patients, mean age 61 +/- 10 years) with 233 valves in the mitral (n = 67) and aortic (n = 166) positions whose function was considered normal by clinical and echocardiographic evaluation. Patterns of "normal" transprosthetic leakage were assessed with transthoracic echocardiography in all valves and with transesophageal echocardiography in six selected mitral valve prostheses. For the mitral valve prostheses, we found that peak and mean gradient, as well as pressure half-time, were not significantly different in either the 25 or the 31 mm valves (median values from 15 to 10 mm Hg, from 4 to 4 mm Hg, and from 70 to 83 ms p = Not significant for all). On transthoracic study, 12 patients (17%) with a Sorin Bicarbon valve in the mitral position showed minimal transprosthetic leakage. On transesophageal study, all patients showed a transprosthetic leakage whose spatial distribution had a complex pattern: in planes orthogonal to the leaflet axis, two to four jets arising from the hinge points and converging toward the center of the valve plane could be visualized
