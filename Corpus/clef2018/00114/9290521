Noniatrogenic pediatric vascular trauma: a ten-year experience at a level I trauma center. We retrospectively reviewed all pediatric patients (< 18 years old) who presented to a Level I trauma center from 1984 to 1994 with noniatrogenic vascular trauma. There were 48 patients (42 male and 6 female) ages 2 to 17 years. Mechanism of injury included gunshot wounds (34) stab wounds (10), and blunt trauma (4). The lower extremities were most commonly injured (31), followed by upper extremity (17), trunk (8), and neck (4). Twenty-one (44%) patients had associated nonvascular injuries (primarily orthopedic or peripheral nerve). Eighteen (37%) patients underwent preoperative angiography for suspected extremity (15) or carotid injuries (3). Twenty-nine patients went to surgery without angiography based on severe ischemia (11) or hemorrhage (18). Arterial injuries (45) were managed by interposition reverse saphenous vein graft (16), primary repair (15), ligation (5), or other operative (5) and nonoperative treatment (4). Venous injuries (15) were treated with primary repair (8), patch (3), ligation (3), and nonoperative management (1). Fasciotomy was performed in six (12%). There were three deaths (6%), all due to aortic and/or caval injuries. Limb salvage in survivors was 100 per cent. There were no complications from angiography. Postoperative duplex scans demonstrated patency in six of the seven patients studied with venous injuries. We conclude that 1) noniatrogenic pediatric vascular trauma is uncommon, and 2) using an aggressive approach to both the diagnosis and treatment of these injuries can achieve excellent limb salvage rates with a low morbidity and mortality.
