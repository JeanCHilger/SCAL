Doppler evaluation of aortic regurgitation in children. Doppler indexes have been used successfully to determine the severity of aortic regurgitation (AR) in adults but have not been evaluated systematically in children. To evaluate the accuracy of specific Doppler echocardiographic indexes in assessing the degree of AR in children, 30 children underwent 2-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography within 24 hours of angiography. Patients were divided into 4 groups based on the degree of angiographic AR. Color Doppler jet width, short-axis jet area, jet length, and maximum jet area were measured. AR slope was measured using continuous-wave Doppler. Flow in the abdominal aorta was evaluated using pulsed Doppler. Doppler indexes were compared with the angiographic grade of AR. Jet width and short-axis jet area were significantly different between groups and showed strong correlation with the angiographic grade. Holodiastolic flow reversal in the abdominal aorta separated 1+ to 2+ from 3+ to 4+ AR (100% sensitivity and 100% negative predictive value for 3+ to 4+ AR). Jet length, maximum jet area, and the ratio of reverse to forward abdominal aortic velocity time integrals correlated with angiography but showed little difference between groups that differed by only 1 angiographic grade. AR slope did not correlate with the angiographic grade. We conclude that in children, color Doppler jet width, short-axis jet area, and holodiastolic abdominal aortic flow reversal are the best predictors of angiographic severity. Use of these indexes may obviate the need for angiography to determine the degree of AR in children.
