Balloon angioplasty of native aortic coarctation in infants 3 months of age and younger. The use of balloon dilation to treat native aortic coarctation is controversial, particularly in infants. Between January 1991 and September 1996, 12 patients < or = 3 months of age with native coarctation of the aorta (CoA) underwent balloon angioplasty (BA). All 12 lesions were dilated successfully with a mean reduction in peak systolic gradient from 49.3 +/- 16.5 mm Hg to 6.8 +/- 4.0 mm Hg (p < 0.001) and a mean increase in minimum CoA diameter from 2.4 +/- 0.6 mm to 5.5 +/- 1.3 mm (p < 0.001). Intimal flaps or tears were detected immediately after BA in 4 (33%) of 12 patients by angiography and in 8 (89%) of 9 patients by intravascular ultrasonography. No deaths or major complications related to the BA occurred. One patient had documented asymptomatic femoral artery obstruction, and one patient with hydrops fetalis and congenital pleural effusions died with gram-negative sepsis 1 week after the procedure. Follow-up was available for 10 patients (1 was lost to follow-up) between 2 months and 4.1 years (mean 2.4 +/- 1.3 years) after BA. No patient had an aortic aneurysm. Restenosis occurred in 5 (50%) of 10 patients, requiring reintervention a mean of 2.6 +/- 2.1 months after BA. One patient underwent surgical repair. Repeat BAs were performed in the other four patients three were successful, and one with partial gradient relief required surgical repair. Five patients have not required reintervention a mean of 2.9 +/- 1.0 years after the initial BA. Among these five patients, follow-up intravascular ultrasound performed in three patients a mean of 2.0 +/- 1.9 years after BA showed favorable endovascular remodeling. There was a tendency for early reintervention in patients < 1 month of age and coexistence of a patent ductus arteriosus at the time of BA. In conclusion, selected infants < or = 3 months of age with discrete native CoA may be treated initially with balloon dilation. Most patients who have restenosis respond successfully to repeat BA.
