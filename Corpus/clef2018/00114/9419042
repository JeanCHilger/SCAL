Renal artery stenosis in aortoarteritis: spectrum of disease in children and adults. Nonspecific aortoarteritis is the commonest cause of renovascular hypertension (RVH) accounting for 87% of the patients in the present study. We compared the clinical and radiographic features and outcome in children (n = 16) and adult (n = 24) patients with aortoarteritis. Children have a shorter duration of disease and present more commonly with constitutional symptoms. All the patients were hypertensive however, malignant hypertension and hypertensive encephalopathy were more common in children. Abdominal bruit and asymmetry of pulses were present only in 75 and 35% of the patients, respectively. Asymmetric kidney size on ultrasound was present in 15 of 24 adults, whereas 9 of 16 children had equal sized kidneys. Captopril renography had a better sensitivity for detection of RVH in children (13 of 16 in children vs. 12 of 24 in adults showing positive results). On intra-arterial digital substraction angiography, abdominal aortic involvement was invariable, whereas the thoracic aorta was involved less frequently in both age groups. Angiographic scores for the severity of vascular involvement was significantly lesser in children (6.87+/-4.8) as compared to adults (11.32+/-4.5). Thirteen of the 15 children were found suitable for revascularization, whereas 12 of 24 adults were not considered for revascularization as their kidneys were small and contributed to less than 10% of total function. Six of the adult patients underwent nephrectomy for the control of blood pressure. Results of angioplasty were also better in children than adults. We conclude that children present earlier with less severe vascular disease and respond better to revascularization, as compared to adults.
