Evaluation of various diagnostic methods in aortic-iliac graft infection. Aortoenteric anastomotic fistulae and paraprosthetic aortic-iliac graft infections are rare but devastating and potentially lethal complication of aortic graft surgery. Although the incidence of these complications is reported to be less then 1-4%, the difficulty in diagnosis and management has led to high mortality rates and extensive morbidity. In our opinion computed tomography, 99m Tc-HM-PAO-labeled white blood cell scan and upper GI tract endoscopy are a most useful adjuncts to the diagnosis of all types of aortic graft infection, like paraprosthetic-enteric fistula or graft infection without intestinal communication.
