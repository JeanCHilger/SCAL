Late evaluation with spiral computed tomography of smooth bovine pericardium grafts. To evaluate morphologically by spiral computed tomography (SCT) bovine pericardial grafts as aortic substitutes.Ten patients were submitted to aortic graft evaluation with SCT. There were 8 ascending and 2 descending grafts. Examination was done after 2 to 7 years post operative. Ages ranged from 49 to 67 years, with 6 male and 4 female patients. All had implanted smooth surface naked pericardial grafts.Surgical result was good in all. Distal dissection persisted in some cases. One had a peri-graft hematoma, 5 had no structural changes and 4 presented mild graft dilatation. There were no graft calcification or pseudoaneurysm.Glutaraldehyde preserved naked smooth surface bovine pericardial aortic grafts present satisfactory structural aspect, as seen by SCT, at medium term follow-up. Mild dilatation may be seen in some cases.
