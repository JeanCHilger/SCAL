The surgeon's use of transesophageal echocardiography. Transesophageal echocardiography has become an instrumental diagnostic modality for the accurate evaluation of cardiac and aortic anatomy and function. Multiplanar technology has facilitated improved visualization of structures and enhanced TEE over TTE in many situations. Care of the trauma patient and critically ill patient is improved with the appropriate and timely performance of TEE. Education, certification, credentialing, and determination of competency are areas that need to be addressed continually in the future.
