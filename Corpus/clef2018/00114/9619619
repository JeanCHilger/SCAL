Reference Doppler echocardiographic values for St. Jude Medical, Omnicarbon, and Biocor prosthetic valves in the aortic position. The objectives of the present investigation were (1) to describe Doppler echocardiographic findings for mechanical and biologic aortic valves at an early stage after operation and later in a stable phase and (2) to study the changes occurring between these investigations. Patients (n = 213) who received a mechanical (St. Jude Medical, Omnicarbon) or a biologic (Biocor) valve were studied by Doppler echocardiography within the first week (baseline, n = 203) and after 2 years (late, n = 172). The comparison of baseline with late investigation (mean +/- SD) showed an increase in systolic blood pressure (137 +/- 18.5 to 154 +/- 20.6 mm Hg, p = 0.0001, n = 112), reduction of heart rate (85 +/- 15.3 to 74 +/- 12.0 beats/min, p = 0.0001, n = 141) and increase in stroke volume (59 +/- 20.6 to 77 +/- 19.8 ml, p = 0.0001, n = 132). Prosthetic Doppler echocardiographic findings demonstrated a reduction in blood flow velocity in the left ventricular outflow tract (VLVOT, 1.10 +/- 0.25 to 0.96 +/- 0.23 m/sec, p = 0.0001, n = 146) reduction in peak velocity (Vmax 2.72 +/- 0.53 to 2.59 +/- 0.54 m/sec, p = 0.02, n = 150), reduction in mean pressure gradient (deltaPmean, 18.4 +/- 7.2 to 16.3 +/- 7.3 mm Hg, p = 0.004) and an increase in velocity index (Vmax/VLVOT, 2.56 +/- 0.62 to 2.67 +/- 0.60, p = 0.003, n = 144). The standard deviations of difference between baseline and late investigation expressed as percentage of mean were 25% for VLVOT, 20% for Vmax, 44% for deltaPmean, and 25% for velocity index. In conclusion, this large reference base provides data that should be useful for the clinician evaluating patients with prosthetic valves early after valve replacement as well as at a later stage. When valve dysfunction is suspected a previous investigation for comparison is helpful, and our data describe the changes that normally may be seen between an early baseline and a late investigation.
