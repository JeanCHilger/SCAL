Experimental modifications to a canine infrarenal aortic aneurysm model for the validation of endovascular stent-grafts: an exploratory study. The intraluminal elastase perfusion model has been proven to be potentially effective in producing abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) in rodents, yet has produced unpredictable results in larger animals. The purpose of this study was to explore different variations to an existing elastase perfusion model in the dog in the hopes of producing a consistent AAA for endovascular graft validation. The elastase perfusion canine model was modified as follows: (1) inflation of a balloon catheter in the infrarenal aorta (IA) of 3 dogs following elastase perfusion with doses of 2800 U for 40 min (2) perfusion of the IA of 5 dogs with various elastase doses ranging from 2800 U to 8400 U for 2 h
