Left ventricular mass regression after implantation of St. Jude Medical cardiac valves in small aortic roots. In this study, we analyzed the extent of regression of left ventricular hypertrophy in patients who received small St. Jude Medical (SJM) aortic valves and compared the results with those of another group receiving larger valves. Eighty-eight patients received either 19 or 21 mm valves (Group 1, 25 patients) or either 23 or 25 mm valves (Group 2, 53 patients). Echocardiographic studies were done before the operation and 5 years postoperatively. At follow-up a significant reduction in the left ventricular mass was found for both patient groups (p < 0.0001). Doppler echocardiography derived pressure gradients for both groups were obtained during the follow-up period. As expected, the patients in Group 1 had higher peak pressure gradients than did those in Group 2. However, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups or any significant correlations between peak pressure gradients and body surface area (BSA). Actuarial survival was 84.7% at 15 years for Group 1 and 85.9% at 17 years for Group 2. Actuarial freedom from valve related events was 91.4% at 15 years for Group 1 and 82.7% at 17 years for Group 2. There was no significant difference in survival or valve related event free curves between the 2 groups. After implantations of SJM valves in small aortic roots, significant left ventricular mass regression was obtained, and the results were comparable to those for valves of other sizes. The long-term performance of aortic valve replacement with small valves was satisfactory as judged by improvement in the functional class of patients and survival statistics, the durability of the prosthesis, and valve related morbidity comparable to that of valves of other sizes.
