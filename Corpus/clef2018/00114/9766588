Long-term Doppler echocardiographic results of aortic or mitral valve replacement with Biocor porcine bioprosthesis. Our objectives were to evaluate the long-term bioprosthetic and cardiac functional outcome after insertion (over a 10-year period) of a new-generation porcine zero pressure-fixed Biocor bioprosthesis, as well as to determine the echocardiographic accuracy for selection of patients requiring reoperation. The long-term systematic Doppler echocardiographic assessment after valve replacement with this bioprosthesis is lacking.Between January 1983 and January 1993, we inserted 756 Biocor prostheses in the aortic (619) or mitral (137) positions. All 51 patients who had a reoperation during the follow-up time were evaluated echocardiographically before reoperation. Additionally, 263 of 446 patients (59%) with aortic bioprostheses and 42 of 74 patients (57%) with mitral bioprostheses who were alive in January 1993 had long-term echocardiographic follow-up.Group A: Normally functioning bioprostheses were found in the aortic position in 242 of 263 patients and in the mitral position in 33 of 42 patients. Group B: Thirty patients had abnormal bioprosthetic function. Eleven patients had regurgitation, 3 had a combined lesion, and signs of calcification appeared in 16 patients with aortic valves, all with a peak gradient of above 60 mm Hg. Group C: Patients who had a reoperation (41 aortic and 10 mitral) within the follow-up period were followed up echocardiographically from the detection of a possible valve dysfunction until reoperation, and the findings accorded well with those at operation in 49 of 51 patients.These findings suggest that, during a long-term follow-up, most bioprostheses function normally, facilitating improved heart function. Abnormalities in a bioprosthesis usually develop gradually, enabling their detection by Doppler echocardiographic evaluations performed regularly or in case of any symptomatic deterioration.
