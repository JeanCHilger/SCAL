Graft patency evaluation with colour-Doppler ultrasonography after bypass surgery in Takayasu's arteritis: a direct colour-flow lumen imaging method. To assess the feasibility and potential diagnostic usefulness of colour-Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) to detect complications of supra-aortic vascular bypass grafts in Takayasu's arteritis (TA).A prospective study.Nine supra-aortic grafts in six patients with Takayasu's arteritis.The minimal, maximal, and true colour-flow image diameters of the lumens of the grafts were measured and stenoses, occlusions, and dilatations were evaluated and compared with angiographic findings.The sensitivity for detection in > 50% stenoses and in total occlusions was 75% while specificity was 100%. Only one 40% stenosis had been overlooked in whole. The maximal difference of stenosis by two methods was otherwise 20%.CDFI was in general able to expose stenoses in supra-aortic grafts, but the lack of visibility of some grafts throughout their length cause the false results. It appears that some angiographies can be replaced by CDFI and that this is a suitable method for follow-up in symptom-free patients with grafts.
