Register Alacant: register of the treatment of supra-aortic trunk stenosis with angioplasty and stent placement. Study group of Register Alacant. The Register Alacant is a clinico-radiological register of patients in Alicante province with symptomatic carotid or vertebral artery stenosis, treated by means of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and subsequent placement of a Stent-type endovascular prosthesis.The aims of the register are as follows: 1. To evaluate the safety of this type of treatment. 2. To measure the clinical ultrasonographic and radiological efficacy of the technique in the short, intermediate and long term. In this article we consider the rational basis which led to its introduction and present the design of this register and aspects of organization which make it work in practice. There is only one centre (HG SVS Alicante) where this technique is used for treatment and another seven centres from which patients are 'recruited' and sent for angioplasty. Whilst the procedure is being carried out, the patient is monitored by transcranial Doppler using both medial cerebral arteries. On completion of the angioplasty the patients is immediately assessed clinically and subsequently daily for the first two post-operative days. Further follow-up is done in the centre which initially corresponded to each patient. Carotid eco-Doppler is done weekly as follow-up. Digital angiography is done one year later. All patients are followed-up indefinitely. The minimum follow-up period is one year, although three years or more are recommended.The register was started in April 1998 and monthly meetings are held to discuss and programme each case, and all the investigators participate in this.
