Value of segmental limb blood pressures in predicting results of aortofemoral bypass. The efficacy of segmental limb blood pressure measurements, assessed noninvasively by Doppler ultrasound, in predicting the result of aortofemoral reconstruction was evaluated in fifty-two extremities with varying extent of aortoiliac and more distal arterial occlusive disease. Three prognostic correlates were analyzed: (1) preoperative proximal thigh/arm pressure index (TPI) (2) preoperative pressure gradient between adjacent leg segments (proximal thigh, above-knee, below-knee, and ankle), normally less than 30 mm Hg
