Venous ultrasound catheter-tip technique for evaluation of arterial hemodynamics. A variety of devices has been used for measuring flow properties of deep-lying arteries, but many have limitations. This paper describes a relatively nontraumatic intravenous approach which uses a catheter in connection with a pulsed ultrasonic Doppler velocity meter (PUDVM) and an ultrasound echo track. The venous ultrasound catheter (VUC) has permitted measurements of local instantaneols blood velocity, flow, and wall motion in the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries of beagle dogs evaluation studies have been conducted to compare the VUC recordings with an independent method for measuring blood flow and wall motion. Coupling of this catheter-tip device with the PUDVM and echo track provides chronic measurements of hemodynamic parameters in these deep vessels which were virtually impossible to obtain previously. This technique may prove useful in monitoring vessel pathology longitudinally as well as in basic experimental situations requiring flow and arterial wall mechanical properties.
