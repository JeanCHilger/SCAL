Effects of exercise on Doppler-derived pressure difference, valve resistance, and effective orifice area in different aortic valve prostheses of similar size. The effects of increased transvalvular volume flow on Doppler-derived measurements were compared in similarly sized, normally functioning, mechanical prostheses, stented and stentless porcine bioprostheses, and homografts. Homograft and stentless valves showed the largest effective orifice area and the lowest pressure differences and valve resistance at rest and during exercise-induced increase in flow rates.
