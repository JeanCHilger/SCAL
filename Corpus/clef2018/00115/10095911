Peritonitis caused by spontaneous rupture of pyonephrosis in pregnancy. Report of a case. Peritonitis after spontaneous rupture of pyonephrosis into the peritoneal cavity is a rare complication, usually diagnosed intraoperatively. We report a case of a woman presenting with left lumbar pain and fever during pregnancy. On admission, ultrasonography showed a pregnancy with fetal activity for 16 weeks, and pyonephrosis in the left kidney, but on a normal right kidney. After antibiotic therapy and upper urinary, tract stenting renal drainage revealed purulent urine, fever persisted with acute abdomen. Clinical and radiological assessment showed features of acute peritonitis with pyonephrosis. Treatment consisted of laparotomy with nephrectomy and abdominal lavage and drainage. The postoperative complication was septic shock requiring resuscitation and artificial ventilation and prolonged convalescence.
