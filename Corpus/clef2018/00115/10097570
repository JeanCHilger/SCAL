Ultrasonographic evaluation of major vessels in patients with vibration disease. Common carotic arteries, odd visceral branches of abdominal aorta were subgected to ultrasound Doppler examination and color duplex ultrasound in 100 vibration disease patients and 57 liquidators of Chernobyl power accident consequences. Stenosis of various degree and thickened vascular wall were revealed in 23.6 +/- 4.5% of vibration disease patients and in 46.2 +/- 7.98% of liquidators (p < 0.05). These data prove that the liquidators being younger (4 years average age difference) than the vibration disease patients demonstrate more significant atherosclerotic changes of vascular wall.
