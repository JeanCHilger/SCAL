Doppler echocardiography assessment of prosthetic heart valves. Transthoracic Doppler echocardiography is an accurate noninvasive method for the evaluation of prosthetic valve function.  The flow characteristics and pressure gradients of normally functioning mechanical and bioprosthetic valves have been, in general established. Normal functioning mitral valve prostheses have a valve area greater than 1.8 cm 2 with the St. Jude valve having the largest effective valve area and normally functioning aortic prosthetic valves have a peak instantaneous gradient of less than 45 mmHg, with the Starr-Edwards valves (Starr-Edwards, Irvine CA) showing the highest gradients.  The incidence of minimal or mild regurgitation is approximately 15% to 30% in the mitral position and 25% to 50% in the aortic position, with the higher incidence of regurgitation seen with mechanical compared to bioprosthetic valves. Transthoracic Doppler echocardiography can accurately detect patients with prosthetic valvular stenosis.  The presence of prosthetic aortic regurgitation can also generally be accurately assessed, except in the presence of both prosthetic aortic and mitral valves.  Assessment of prosthetic mitral regurgitation remains limited due to significant attenuation of the ultrasound beam by the prosthesis and the frequent underestimation of severity of regurgitation.  Other limitations of transthoracic studies include assessment of leaflet morphology, detection of vegetations and valve abscesses, and differentiation between valvular and paravalvular regurgitation.
