Impact of transesophageal color flow Doppler echocardiography in current cardiology practice. Of 3,480 patients who were referred for cardiac ultrasound evaluation, 230 patients (6.6%) underwent transesophageal echocardiography because the transthoracic study was not feasible, technically inadequate, or provided insufficient diagnostic information for optimal patient management.  There were 149 inpatients and 81 outpatients.  The majority (182 patients, 79%) had aortic or mitral disorders.  In 166 patients (72%), transesophageal echocardiography played a significant role in patient management.  Transesophageal echocardiography was most useful in evaluating diseases of the aorta (dissection, root abscess, or aneurysm), mitral prosthesis, complications of endocarditis, left atrial appendage thrombi, and in determining the cause of mitral insufficiency. Transesophageal echocardiography was useful in the evaluation of critically ill patients and those with severe lung disease.
