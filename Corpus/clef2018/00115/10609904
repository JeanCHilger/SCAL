Midterm results after aortic valve replacement with the autologous tissue cardiac valve. To assess midterm results after aortic valve replacement (AVR) with an autologous tissue cardiac valve (ATCV). This new technique was developed to construct a tissue prosthesis for AVR using the patients pericardium, harvested at the time of operation with negligible effect on operating time.Briefly, glutaraldehyde tanned pericardium is mounted on a stent requiring no suturing. Between March 1994 and December 1996, 87 patients, 44/43 M/F and aged 70 +/- 6 years had AVR for aortic stenosis (80%), aortic insufficiency (6%) and combined lesions (14%), one patient suffered from endocarditis. Additional coronary artery bypass was done in 25%, aortic root enlargement in 7%. Aortic cross clamp and cardiopulmonary bypass times were 69 +/- 21 and 93 +/- 29 min. All patients were followed by clinical examination and color flow Doppler echocardiography in 3-12 months interval. Follow up was 99% complete.There were five perioperative deaths (6%), none of them valve related. Eighty-one patients were followed up to a period of 52 months (mean interval 37.5 +/- 1.3 months), one patient was lost for follow up. Overall survival was 86, 81, 79 and 71% at 12, 24, 36 and 48 months, respectively. There were 14 late deaths with eight (10%) valve related (four cerebral deaths, four sudden deaths). Sixteen patients (20%) had to be re-operated due to severe valve incompetence. Freedom from reoperation was 98, 97, 90 and 63% at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months, respectively. Valve incompetence occurred suddenly, without previous signs in the follow-up examinations. Selection and preparation of the pericardium, the way of fixation of the tissue--brief immersion in glutaraldehyde--and engineering problems might be responsible for this disastrous outcome.Due to these results we must state, that the ATCV did not fulfill our expectations and presently we can not recommend it as an aortic valve substitute.
