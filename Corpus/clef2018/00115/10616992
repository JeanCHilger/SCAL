The Edwards Prima stentless valve: hemodynamic performance at one year. The Edwards Prima stentless valve (EPSV) is a porcine aortic root cylinder with resected coronary ostia, fixed in glutaraldehyde at low pressure. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the hemodynamic performance of the EPSV 1 year after aortic valve replacement.From December 1994 to February 1996, 29 patients underwent aortic valve replacement with EPSV used in the subcoronary position (group 1, n = 23) or as a root replacement (group 2, n = 6). Hemodynamic performance of EPSV was assessed by two-dimensional Doppler echocardiography at 1 week, 6 months, and 1 year by calculating peak transprosthetic velocity, peak and mean gradients, effective orifice area, degree of aortic regurgitation, and regression of left ventricular hypertrophy.There were no operative deaths. One patient in group 2 died after 3 months at reoperation for endocarditis. In group 1 early mean gradient (25+/-5 mm Hg for 23 mm and 19+/-5 mm Hg for 25 mm) decreased at 6 months and 1 year in the 23-mm size (17+/-7 mm Hg and 15+/-4 mm Hg, p < 0.01) and at 1 year in the 25-mm size (14+/-4 mm Hg, p = 0.03) without modifications of the effective orifice area in both sizes. A significant reduction in left ventricular hypertrophy occurred at 6 months and 1 year in both sizes. In group 2 lower early gradients were recorded with subsequent improvement at follow-up reduction in left ventricular hypertrophy occurred as well.The EPSV used in the subcoronary position has shown high early gradients, which partially regressed at 6 months, with further improvement at 1 year. Gradients are attributed to inward folding of the Dacron cloth at the right coronary ostium, being more evident in patients with aortic stenosis without dilatation of the aortic root and coronary ostia close to the annulus. In such patients a better early hemodynamic result can be obtained by using the EPSV as a root replacement.
