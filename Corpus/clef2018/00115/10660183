Aortic root geometry and stentless porcine valve competence. The goal of this study was to characterize medium-term changes in aortic root geometry after stentless aortic valve replacement, the relationship between aortic sinotubular junction and the competence of stentless valves. A total of 205 consecutive patients (mean age 73+/-6 years 120 men, 85 women) received a Freestyle stentless porcine aortic valve and were studied prospectively by echocardiography from 1 week to 5 years. Internal diameters of outflow tract, annulus, sinus, sinotubular junction, and ascending aortic root were measured at early ejection and indexed to stentless valve size. The degree of stentless valve regurgitation was semiquantified by color Doppler echocardiography. A total of 701 echocardiographic studies were obtained and analyzed
