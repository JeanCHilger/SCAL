Rest and exercise hemodynamics before and after valve replacement--a combined Doppler/catheter study. Hemodynamic improvement is a common finding following valve replacement. However, despite a normally functioning prosthesis and normal left ventricular ejection fraction, some patients may show an abnormal hemodynamic response to exercise.In a combined catheter/Doppler study, rest and exercise hemodynamics were evaluated in 23 patients following aortic (n = 12) (Group 1) or mitral valve (n = 11) (Group 2) replacement and compared with preoperative findings. Patient selection was based on absence of coronary artery disease and left ventricular failure as shown by preoperative angiography. Cardiac output, pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary pressure, and pulmonary resistance were measured by right heart catheterization, whereas the gradient across the valve prosthesis was determined by Doppler echocardiography. Postoperative evaluation was done at rest and during exercise. The mean follow-up was 8.2 +/- 2.2 years in Group 1 and 4.2 +/- 1 years in Group 2.With exercise, there was a significant rise in cardiac output in both groups. In Group 1, mean pulmonary pressure/capillary pressure decreased from 24 +/- 9/18 +/- 9 mmHg preoperatively to 18 +/- 2/12 +/- 4 mmHg postoperatively (p < 0.05), and increased to 43 +/- 12/30 +/- 8 mmHg with exercise (p < 0.05). The corresponding values for Group 2 were 36 +/- 12/24 +/- 6 mmHg preoperatively, 24 +/- 7/17 +/- 6 mmHg postoperatively (p < 0.05), and 51 +/- 2/38 +/- 4 mmHg with exercise (p < 0.05). Pulmonary vascular resistance was 109 +/- 56 dyne.s.cm-5 preoperatively, 70 +/- 39 dyne.s.cm-5 postoperatively (p < 0.05), and 70 +/- 36 dyne.s.cm-5 with exercise in Group 1. The corresponding values for Group 2 were 241 +/- 155 dyne.s.cm-5, 116 +/- 39 dyne.s.cm-5 (p < 0.05), and 104 +/- 47 dyne.s.cm-5. There was a significant increase in the gradients across the valve prosthesis in both groups, showing a significant correlation between the gradient at rest and exercise. No correlation was found between valve prosthesis gradient and pulmonary pressures.Exercise-induced pulmonary hypertension and abnormal left ventricular filling pressures seem to be a frequent finding following aortic or mitral valve replacement. Both hemodynamic abnormalities seem not to be determined by obstruction to flow across the valve prosthesis and may be concealed, showing nearly normal values at rest but a pathologic response to physical stress.
