Screening of abdominal aortic aneurysm: a pragmatic approach. In order to evaluate the feasibility of a selective screening programme for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) within an urban setting and assess its impact on the expected increase in workload for the local hospital(s), a population based, prospective study was performed. A total of 4823 men aged 65 years were invited for ultrasound examination of the abdominal aorta between January 1993 and April 1997 as part of a general practice-based aneurysm screening programme covering two districts with a general hospital each. All examinations were carried out by senior radiographers using a portable B mode grey scale machine and a 3.5 MHz curvi-linear array probe. Patients with a maximum aortic diameter of over 3 cm were annually recalled, those with over 4 cm were referred to hospital for an out-patient's appointment. Those with AAA greater than 5 cm were considered for surgery. Of those approached, 3497 (72.5%) took part in the study, 1206 (25%) did not attend and 120 (2.5%) were excluded by their general practitioners (GPs) on medical grounds. Of the men taking part, 3130 (89.5%) had an aortic diameter equal to or less than 2.5 cm, 196 (5.6%) between 2.6 and 3.0 cm, and 171 (4.9%) had aortic diameters greater than 3 cm--29 of whom had AAA greater than 5 cm with a mean diameter of 6.0 cm (range 5.1-9.0 cm). Of 127 men with an initial diameter of 3.1-4.0 cm (mean progression in size of 2.3 mm/year), 22 enlarged to > 4 cm and 3 to > 5 cm. Of 24 men with an initial diameter of 4.1-5.0 cm, 6 enlarged to > 5 cm. Some 69 (2%) patients were referred to hospital requiring a total of 125 consultations (1.8 consultations per patient) 21 underwent surgery and one died from rupture whilst awaiting surgery. Five patients refused their operation and two failed to attend the clinic (all > 5 cm) but remain well to date. No patient died following surgery. We conclude that, screening for AAA in men at age 65 years within an urban setting is feasible and well received by patients and GPs. Screening does not lead to a huge increase in terms of outpatient appointments and operations for AAA.
