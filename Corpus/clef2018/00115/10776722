Rupture of Dacron aorto-femoral graft. Case report. A 74-year-old patient was admitted to our department in a serious general condition due to massive bleeding. He had been treated 10 years previously in another hospital with an aorto-bifemoral bypass for obstructive disease using a knitted-Dacron graft. A large pulsating mass was present in the right iliac fossa as well as enormous pulsating enlargement of the scrotum. Echo color-Doppler investigation detected dilation up to 5 cm in diameter of the right branch of the graft and a large perigraft hematoma communicating with a similar mass in the scrotum. The patient was submitted to emergency surgery and a large rupture of the graft was found. The dilated segment was resected and replaced by a new 8 mm Dacron graft. Postoperative course was uneventful.
