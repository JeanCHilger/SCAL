Percutaneous nephrolithotripsy in ectopic kidneys. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), although an accepted treatment modality in anatomically normal kidneys, is still not universally performed for calculi in pelvic ectopic kidneys. Fear of injury to abdominal viscera makes it a technically challenging procedure.We have performed PCNL in nine patients with calculi in pelvic ectopic kidneys. Technical factors which made this procedure safe include ultrasound-guided puncture, use of a mature tract or an Amplatz sheath, routine postoperative double-J stenting, and nephrostogram prior to nephrostomy tube removal.Complete stone clearance was achieved in all cases. Six patients were treated in a single stage, while three patients required two stages. Seven patients needed only one tract, and two needed two tracts. No notable complications were encountered. The average hospital stay was 5.2 days.With proper precautions and meticulous technique, PCNL is a safe and effective modality to treat calculi in pelvic ectopic kidney.
