Transrenal fixation of aortic endografts: intermediate follow-up of a single-center experience. To examine the fate of the renal ostia following transrenal fixation of endovascular aortic stent-grafts.Thirty-five patients (29 men mean age 75 years) undergoing endovascular repair for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) had transrenal fixation of the uncovered proximal stent due to a short (< 1.5 cm long) or conical neck or a periprocedural endoleak. Eighteen (51%) patients were hypertensiveTwo patients with > or = 60% RAS had renal stents placed during the endograft procedure the other 5 RAS patients were normotensive and their renal lesions were not treated. Overall technical success was 82.9% (29/35). One (2.9%) case was converted due to graft twisting. There were 5 (14.2%) early endoleaks. Transient postoperative creatinine elevations were observed in 5 (14.2%) cases. Over a median 11-month period (range 2-24), no secondary endoleaks or silent renal artery occlusions were seen. One normotensive patient with an untreated > or = 60% renal lesion developed hypertension and severe stenosis (99%) at 4 monthsIn the intermediate period, transrenal fixation appears to have no adverse effects on renal blood flow. Moreover, in patients with no evidence of renal disease or preoperative RAS < 60%, it does not precipitate or cause progression of renal stenosis. However, patients with preoperatively documented RAS > or = 60% are a concern and mandate further study.
