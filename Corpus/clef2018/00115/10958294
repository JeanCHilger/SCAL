Embolization of type II endoleaks fed by the inferior mesenteric artery: using the superior mesenteric artery approach. To evaluate the use of a superior mesenteric artery (SMA) approach to embolize type II endoleaks arising from the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA).When reperfusion of the aneurysmal sac via the SMA occurs through the IMA, as shown by computed tomography (CT) and angiography, the IMA origin can be accessed via the marginal artery or the anastomosis of Riolan. The SMA is catheterized with a 5-F catheter, and a coaxial catheter is advanced to the leak to deliver 2- to 8-mm-diameter minicoils to embolize the IMA origin and entire aneurysmal sac. Embolization usually requires from 1 to 2 hours to complete. In our experience with this technique in 11 cases, complications have not occurred, and there has been only one very small residual leak that sealed the next day. Over a 24.5-month follow-up (range 12-39), the endoleaks have remained sealed according to serial color duplex scans.Successful percutaneous treatment of type II endoleak due to IMA inflow can be accomplished using an SMA access via the Riolan anastomosis or marginal artery. The procedure appears to be safe and has no adverse effects.
