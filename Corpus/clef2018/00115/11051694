Abdominal aortic aneurysm and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. The aim of this study was to report a series of patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease operated for abdominal aortic aneurysm.From 1986 to 1999, seven patients with this pathologic association were operated for aneurysm by the same surgeon. All were males, 47 to 69 years old (mean: 57.7). All were hypertensive and heavy smokers. Four were treated by hemodialysis. In five patients, the aneurysm was an incidental discovery, while two patients presented signs of obstructive arterial disease of the lower limbs. Ultrasound was the routine screening investigation, completed by aortography in all patients and by computed tomography in 2 patients. Surgical treatment consisted of intrasaccular repair of the aneurysm with a straight aortic tube (n = 5), a bifurcated prosthesis from the aorta to both common iliac arteries (n = 1) and a bifurcated prosthesis from the aorta to both common femoral arteries (n = 1).There was no postoperative mortality or morbidity. Two late deaths (at 5 and 8 years) occurred from myocardial infarction. Only one patient subsequently received a kidney transplant. Repairs were verified by postoperative angiography: anatomical results were satisfactory in all patients. Only nine similar cases have been published in the literature, including two deaths from ruptured aneurysm.The clinical diagnosis of aortic aneurysm is difficult in patients with polycystic kidneys due to renal volume. Ultrasound scan of the aorta is recommended to screen these patients for aneurysm. The data of our series show that the main cause of aortic aneurysms is atheroma and that a pathogenic link between this lesion and polycystic kidney disease is questionable. Elective aortic repair is recommended in order to avoid rupture of the aneurysm.
