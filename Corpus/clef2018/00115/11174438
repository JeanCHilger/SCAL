Homograft pulmonic stenosis after the Ross procedure: evaluation of the stenotic valve area by proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA). The proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) technique has been used to evaluate valvular regurgitant flow, regurgitant orifice area, and stenotic valve area. This report shows the usefulness of this Doppler technique in quantifying the stenotic valve area of a pulmonic valve homograft prosthesis after the Ross procedure. The patient was a 35-year-old man who had a Ross procedure 3 years earlier for aortic stenosis, which included replacement of the pulmonic valve with a cryopreserved homograft pulmonic valve. With an aliasing velocity set at 40 cm/s and a PISA radius of 1.1 cm, the pulmonic valve area was calculated as follows: Pulmonic valve peak flow rate = 2 x3.14 x1.12 x40 = 304 mL/s Pulmonic valve area = Peak flow rate / Peak velocity = 284/350 = 0.87 cm2.
