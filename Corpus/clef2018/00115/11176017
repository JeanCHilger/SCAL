Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms during cardiac catheterization. Many authorities advocate routine screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). Patients undergoing cardiac catheterization often have risk factors for AAA. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical utility of screening for AAA during cardiac catheterization.We prospectively examined the abdominal aorta in 127 patients undergoing diagnostic cardiac catheterization. Panning down during left ventriculography was the primary method for imaging the abdominal aorta. However, if there was difficulty advancing the catheter into the abdominal aorta, a formal postero-anterior abdominal aortogram was obtained. Off-line analysis of aortic morphology and diameters was performed.We achieved adequate visualization of the abdominal aorta in 99 of 127 patients. Mean age was 67 years 75% were male. Risk factors for AAA were common, and included: history of smoking (88%)Undiagnosed abdominal aortic aneurysms can be identified during routine examination of the abdominal aorta during cardiac catheterization. Because screening for AAA during cardiac catheterization is inexpensive and easily performed, it should be a routine part of the examination.
