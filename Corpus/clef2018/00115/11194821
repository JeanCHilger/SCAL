Does complete aneurysm exclusion ensure long-term success after endovascular repair? To examine whether complete aneurysm exclusion is a reliable marker for successful long-term endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair.The medical records, computed tomographic (CT) scans, and duplex examinations of all the patients who underwent endovascular AAA repair at a single institution and had at least 12 months of follow-up were reviewed. Sixty-seven patients (58 men mean age 74 years, range 57-87) were identified. Complete aneurysm exclusion was defined by the absence of an endoleak at any time before an adverse event. The primary endpoint included all major adverse events that occurred during the postoperative period, including aneurysm expansion, acute symptoms referable to the AAA, late secondary procedures, ruptures, and deaths from ruptures and all other causes.There were 44 adverse events (8 expanding aneurysms, 4 acute symptoms, 17 secondary procedures, and 15 deaths from other causes) in 28 (42%) patients. Among 36 (54%) patients who had initial complete aneurysm exclusion (no endoleak), 12 (33%) experienced adverse events, compared with 16 (52%) events in 31 patients who had endoleak (chi2 = 1.59, p = 0.21).There was no statistically significant difference in adverse events based on the presence or absence of endoleak. Complete aneurysm exclusion as defined by absence of an endoleak does not indicate an event-free postoperative course. A better marker of clinical success of endovascular AAA repair is needed.
