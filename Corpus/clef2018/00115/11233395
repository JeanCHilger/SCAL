Balloon dilation for aortic recoarctation: morphology at the site of dilation and long-term efficacy. We undertook this study to assess the immediate and long-term outcome of balloon angioplasty performed for recurrent or residual coarctation of the aorta, and to assess the changes in the vessel wall caused by this procedure.Clinical, echocardiographic, angiographic and hemodynamic data from 71 patients who underwent balloon angioplasty for recoarctation between January 1987 and January 1998 were analysed retrospectively.Angioplasty was performed after a median of 82.6 months (range 1.4 mo-20.9 y, mean 88.5 mo) following surgery for coarctation. Mean systolic pressure gradients were reduced from 27 +/- 15 mmHg to 11 +/- 11 mmHg after angioplasty (p < 0.0001). The mean diameter at the site of recoarctation increased from 5.5 +/- 2.5 to 7.5 +/- 2.7 mm (p < 0.0001). Outpouchings of contrast agents, indicating the disruption of the inner layers of the vessel wall, were defined as extravasations. They were observed in one-quarter of the angiograms performed immediately after the intervention. Immediate success of angioplasty was achieved in 71%, and persisted in 69% of patients during long-term follow up. The main determinant for immediate success was the age at the time of the procedure (p < 0.05), while the main determinant for long-term success was the increase achieved in diameter. Extravasations did not progress to aneurysms, neither acutely nor during echocardiographic follow-up studies. For further follow-up, more sensitive imaging techniques will be necessary to delineate the morphology of the site of extravasation observed immediately after angioplasty.
