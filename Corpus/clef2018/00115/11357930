Associated vascular lesions in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. Atherosclerotic involvement of extracoronary arteries in patients undergoing myocardial revascularization can cause severe postoperative complications and increase postoperative mortality. Between January and November 1998, routine preoperative echo-Doppler study of carotid vessels, abdominal aorta and iliac-femoral arteries was performed in all patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) at our institution, in order to assess the prevalence and the degree of associated vascular lesions. Correlations between echo-Doppler findings, angiographic patterns of coronary lesions and atherosclerotic risk factors were analyzed in all cases. Among 302 patients undergoing CABG, 186 (61.6%) had carotid disease, with a haemodynamically significant stenosis (>70%) of internal carotid in 31 (10.2%). Twenty-three patients had asymptomatic severe carotid disease. A significant correlation between severity of coronary disease and prevalence of severe carotid disease was found (p = 0.02). An abdominal aortic dilatation (diameter > 25 mm) was found in 20 cases (6.6%), with a diameter >35 mm in 7 patients (2.3%), 6 with triple-vessel coronary disease, and 1 with double-vessel disease. Atherosclerotic lesions of iliac-femoro-popliteal axis were found in 165 (54.6%) patients, with a strong correlation to the severity of coronary disease (p = 0.02) lesions were haemodynamically significant (> 70%) in 48 (15.8%) cases. Symptoms of carotid and peripheral vascular disease are no reliable predictors of perioperative risk in patients undergoing CABG. Non-invasive complete arterial investigation should be routinely performed in these patients, in order to plan the most suitable operative approach and to prevent perioperative vascular complications.
