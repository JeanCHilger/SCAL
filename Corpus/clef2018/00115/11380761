High vitamin E plasma levels and low low-density lipoprotein oxidation are associated with the absence of atherosclerosis in octogenarians. To identify the biological characteristics of older subjects with vascular successful aging (VASA), defined as the absence of instrumental signs and clinical symptoms of atherosclerosis in the extracoronary and coronary vessels.A cross-sectional study.A university-affiliated outpatient clinic.Sixty older subjects (30 with VASA and 30 controls with moderate carotid atherosclerosis (AG group)) from a sample of 705 subjects age 75 and older consecutively screened.Clinical examination ultrasonographic examination of carotid, vertebral, abdominal aortic, iliac, and femoral arteriesCompared with controls, there were more females in the VASA group (82% vs 50%, P <.01), and fewer previous smokers (20.5% vs 52.5%, P <.01). Vitamin E/total cholesterol levels both in plasma (4.81 vs 3.51 micromol/mmol, P <.001) and in isolated LDLs (2.71 vs 1.86 microg/mg LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), P <.01), were higher in the VASA group, as was the resistance of LDLs to in vitro oxidation (as indicated by a longer duration of the lag phase: 80.2 vs 65.6 minutes, P <.001). The level of fluorescent products of lipid peroxidation (FPLPs) in native LDLs was lower in the VASA group (13.5 vs 18.8 URF/mg LDL-C, P <.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that only plasma vitamin E level (odds ratio (OR) = 6.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.48-24.63) and FPLPs in LDLs (OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.31-0.91) were independently associated with VASA.These results suggest that an appropriate level of vitamin E and a low level of LDL oxidation might be important for reaching advanced age without developing atherosclerosis.
