The UHP ultrasound protocol: a novel ultrasound approach to the empiric evaluation of the undifferentiated hypotensive patient. This report describes a novel sonographic protocol for the evaluation of the undifferentiated hypotensive patient. This protocol combines components of 3 sonographic applications: free fluid, cardiac, and abdominal aorta into a single protocol. We believe this protocol and its underlying principles should be a routine part of the empiric evaluation of the patient with undifferentiated hypotension or pulseless electrical activity.
