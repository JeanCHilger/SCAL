Percutaneous angioplasty of the infra-renal aorta. Report of 9 cases. Between June 1996 and September 2000, nine angioplasties of the infra-renal aorta were performed in two Surgical Vascular Centers (Hospital Saint-Joseph, Paris, Polyclinic La Baule), in 6 men and three women age ranged from 36 to 72 years (middle age 48 years and 2 months). Eight of these patients presented important stenoses of the middle infra-renal aorta, or in the aortic bifurcation, one of them presented an occlusion, leading to severe intermittent claudication, and rest pain. After endoluminal kissing balloon angioplasty, five aortic stents (five patients), and six iliac primitive arteries stents (in three patients), extended beyond the aorta, were placed. One isolated angioplasty was also performed. All the procedures were performed in the operative room, with good results, except for one patient requiring emergency aorto-bi-femoral by-pass, because of acute leg ischemia, immediately following the procedure. Follow-up was clinical, with Us-Doppler scan, and angiogram in all cases. After 36 months follow-up (4-52), all patients are asymptomatic, with permeable stents. This technique is well-known since 1980, without excessive morbidity. Aortic angioplasty represents the right technique, with good long-term results, for middle or terminal aorta atheromatous stenosis, according to classical aorto-bi-femoral by-passes. Final result depends on associated iliac arteries stenoses.
