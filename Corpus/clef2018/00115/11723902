Current approach in the treatment of desmoid tumors of the abdominal wall. Desmoids of the abdominal wall are rare tumours with an incidence of 2-4 cases per million. From our experience which is reported here in detail (5 cases observed over the past 20 years), we draw the conclusion that the only completely reliable diagnosis is still histological, in spite of the use of ultrasound, CT scans and the new imaging possibilities afforded by NMR. After comprehensive excision of at least 2 cm of macroscopically healthy tissue from the tumour margins, reconstruction using prosthetic materials, such as Mersilene, PTFE or Prolene was performed. Neither radiotherapy nor chemotherapy were used, since there were doubts as to their usefulness. The functional and cosmetic results were satisfactory in all cases. Over follow-up periods ranging from 3 to 13 years, none of the patients has presented recurrences or incisional hernias.
