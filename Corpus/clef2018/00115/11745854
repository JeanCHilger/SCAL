Sonographic diagnosis and follow-up of idiopathic hepatic artery aneurysm, an unusual cause of obstructive jaundice. Hepatic artery aneurysms are rare. We report an idiopathic hepatic artery aneurysm causing obstructive jaundice in a case in which the common hepatic artery arose from the superior mesenteric artery. The diagnosis of hepatic artery aneurysm was suggested by gray-scale sonography, which showed that the common bile duct and intrahepatic biliary radicles were dilated with no obvious intraluminal abnormality and showed no evidence of a mass in the head of the pancreas. A papillotomy of the papilla duodeni major was performed to relieve the cholestasis. Repeat sonography 2 weeks later showed dilatation of the common bile duct and a cyst-like lesion at the porta hepatis impressing the anterior part of the common bile duct. Doppler sonography confirmed pulsatile flow within the cyst-like lesion. Helical CT showed a well-circumscribed lesion with a density similar to that of the abdominal aorta, and mesenteric angiography showed a 3-cm, smooth aneurysm arising from the common hepatic artery, which originated from the superior mesenteric artery. The aneurysm was successfully treated with transcatheter embolization.
