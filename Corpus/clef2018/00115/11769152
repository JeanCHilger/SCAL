Spontaneous dissection of the celiac artery. Spontaneous dissection of the celiac artery (CA) is uncommon, considering the number of isolated lesions without associated aortic dissection and exclusive of abdominal trauma. We have treated five cases of isolated spontaneous dissection of the CA or its branches. There were three men and two women with a mean age of 54 years. The presenting manifestation was acute epigastralgia in three cases and chronic abdominal pain in one. In the remaining case, dissecting CA was a coincidental finding. All patients underwent abdominal Doppler ultrasound and CT scan imaging, which demonstrated aneurysm in three cases and dissection in two. Work-up also included arteriography in three cases and magnetic resonance (MR) angiography in one. Management consisted of emergency surgical repair in three cases and close surveillance in two. The repair procedure was resection-anastomosis in one case and prosthetic bypass to the hepatic artery in two cases. Postoperative recovery was uneventful in all three cases and patients were symptom-free at 6, 8, and 18 months. Both patients under surveillance were symptom-free at 1 and 2 years. Because of the risk of ischemic and hemorrhagic complications, surgery should be considered for any patient with CA dissection. However, some patients with uncomplicated asymptomatic lesions may be eligible for medical treatment with regular surveillance.
