Postoperative management: buttock claudication and limb thrombosis. As a result of endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms and the necessary associated adjunctive procedures, postoperative buttock claudication and limb thrombosis are complications that every physician who implants stent-grafts should be able to recognize and treat. Whereas the presenting complaints of these complications can be quite obvious, the treatment of them may be not so simple. Studies have shown that 28% of patients who underwent embolization of one or both hypogastric arteries develop buttock claudication. Yet 78% of these affected patients spontaneously resolve their symptoms. Strategies to both minimize and successfully treat this complication are obviously of the utmost importance. Likewise, limb thrombosis can be easy to recognize, but treatment strategies and methods to limit this complication can be quite complex and remain somewhat controversial. One center was able to reduce their limb thrombosis rate from 17% to 0% through the use of intravascular ultrasound and aggressive adjunctive stenting. The purpose of this article is to first review the data concerning these complications and then to discuss treatment strategies that are designed to minimize and treat the actual complication.
