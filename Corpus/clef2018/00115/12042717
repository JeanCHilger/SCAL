Durability of antegrade synthetic aortomesenteric bypass for chronic mesenteric ischemia. The optimal treatment (endovascular/open repair, conduit, configuration) for chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) remains unresolved. This study was designed to review the outcome of patients with CMI treated with antegrade synthetic aortomesenteric bypass.The study was designed as a retrospective review in an academic tertiary care medical center. Patients with CMI who underwent antegrade synthetic aortomesenteric bypass were identified from a computerized vascular registry (from January 1987 to January 2001) with antegrade synthetic aortomesenteric bypass as intervention. Outcome measures were functional outcome (symptom relief, weight gain) and both graft patency (duplex ultrasound/angiography) and survival rates as determined with life-table analysis.Forty-seven patients (female, 70% age, 62 +/- 12 years) underwent aortomesenteric bypass (aortoceliac/aortosuperior mesenteric, n = 45Antegrade synthetic aortomesenteric bypass for CMI is associated with good functional outcome and long-term graft patency.
