Type II endoleaks: predictable, preventable, and sometimes treatable? The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of preoperative coil embolization of lumbar and inferior mesenteric arteries on the incidence of type II endoleak after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.The subjects were consecutive patients who underwent EVAR between January 1996 and January 2001. Patent aortic side branches were identified with preprocedural spiral computed tomographic scanning and calibrated angiography. Coil embolization was performed before EVAR. Patients were followed up with plain radiographs and ultrasound and dual phase spiral computed tomographic scans. Digital subtraction angiography was performed when endoleak was suspected. The outcome measures were the incidence of type II endoleaks and changes in maximum aortic sac diameter (Dmax).Forty patients underwent EVAR, with a median duration of follow-up of 24 months (range, 3 to 48 months). Before surgery, the inferior mesenteric artery was patent in 16 patients (45%) and the lumbar arteries in 21 patients (53%). Inferior mesenteric artery embolization was successful in 13 of 16 patients (81%). Lumbar embolization was attempted in 13 patients and was successful in eight (62%). During EVAR, successful sac exclusion was achieved in 38 patients (95%). None of the patients who underwent embolization before EVAR had type II endoleak develop, eight of 13 patients (62%) with patent lumbar arteries had endoleaks develop (P =.006), and three of these patients subsequently underwent successful coil embolization. Type II endoleak was associated with a 2.0-mm median increase in Dmax (P =.045). A 3.0-mm median reduction in Dmax was seen in the absence of type II endoleak (P =.002).Type II endoleaks are predictable, preventable, and sometimes treatable. Significant sac shrinkage occurs in the absence of lumbar endoleak but not in the presence of type II endoleak.
