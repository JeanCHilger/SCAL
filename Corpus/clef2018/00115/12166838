Stent-graft treatment of penetrating thoracic aortic ulcers. To evaluate the efficacy of stent-graft placement for the treatment of penetrating thoracic aortic ulcers.Ten patients (7 men mean age 73.8 years, range 69-79) were treated for penetrating thoracic aortic ulcers using Talent or Excluder stent-grafts. Preoperative examinations included computed tomographic angiography (CTA), transesophageal echography, and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Follow-up included predischarge multimodal imaging and periodic CTA scans after discharge. Endoleaks, aortic diameter changes, and clinical complications were tracked.Technical success was achieved in 100%, but 1 major neurological complication led to death 3 months after the procedure. Radiological follow-up detected 4 early, endoleaks (3 type I and a type II), all of which spontaneously regressed, and 1 secondary type II endoleak. The mean aortic diameter decreased by 22% over a mean 9-month follow-up.Aortic ulcers are potentially lethal lesions. Considering its low morbidity and mortality, endovascular repair could widen the treatment options for these lesions.
