Severe cardiac failure in newborns with VGAM. Prognosis significance of hemodynamic parameters in neonates presenting with severe heart failure owing to vein of Galen arteriovenous malformation. Neonatal vein of Galen malformation complicated by severe cardiac failure is a rare disease. The purpose was to assess the outcome of this life-threatening malformation and identify hemodynamic prognostic factors.Retrospective study.Twenty-four newborns with cardiac failure requiring mechanical ventilation were consecutively admitted from 1986 to 2000.Cardiovascular evaluation including echocardiogram was performed in all cases. Eighteen transarterial shunt occlusions with glue were applied by the same team of three physicians.Twelve babies survived and underwent one endovascular session at least (median age 20 days) with a mean 63 months follow-up. Embolization was not performed in 6 of the 12 nonsurvivors because of severe brain damage or profound hypotension Cardiogenic shock occurred in all nonsurvivors, but also in one long-term survivor (p<0.0001). Echocardiogram showed signs of right ventricular failure, most often in the dead babies (p=0.005). The pulmonary systemic arterial pressure ratio was significantly higher in the nonsurvivor group (p=0.031), and it decreased significantly after the first embolization only in patients who survived (p=0.01). Patent ductus arteriosus and a diastolic aortic reversed-flow were present in all nonsurvivors in contrast to 30% of the long-term survivors (p=0.003 ). There was no difference in the left ventricular contractility and mean cardiac output between the two groups.The outcome of vein of Galen malformation complicated by severe cardiac failure requiring mechanical ventilation remains poor. Neonatal embolization seems to be beneficial only in babies without suprasystemic pulmonary hypertension.
