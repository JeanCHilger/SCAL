Pseudo-aneurysm of the aortic root in a patient with mechanical aortic prosthesis. The authors describe a case of an ex-intravenous drug user, who received mechanical valve prostheses in the aortic and mitral position for Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis and developed a pseudo-aneurysm of the aortic root with major peri-valvular regurgitation one year after surgery. The images of the transesophageal echocardiogram are presented.
