A life-supporting technique of renal allotransplantation in Macaca fascicularis to evaluate novel immunosuppressive drugs in nonhuman primates. The use of nonhuman primates in preclinical transplantation studies is becoming more common. This report details complete procedures developed for a successful life-supporting kidney allotransplantation program using the cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis).All transplants were performed in wild-caught, ABO-matched, MLR-mismatched adult males. Transplant procedures were staggered: an animal first served as a donor, was allowed to recover for 4 weeks, and was subsequently used as a recipient. The kidney was flushed in situ while the aorta was briefly cross-clamped. The graft was implanted heterotopically end-to-side in the right iliac fossa using microsurgical techniques. An ureteroneocystostomy was constructed a telemetry probe was inserted into the aorta, and the remaining native kidney was removed.Sixty-two transplants were performed in 6.9 +/- 0.1 kg animals. Operating times in the donor and recipient were 126 +/- 3 and 166 +/- 5 min, respectively. The cold ischemia time was 55 +/- 1 min. There were no intraoperative deaths. Postoperative complications were observed in six (9.7%) monkeys and consisted of one early renal arterial thrombosis and five ureteral complications (two of which were successfully repaired). Transplants were ultimately successful in 93.6% (58/62) of cases. Immediate kidney function was satisfactory, with a mean serum creatinine of 1.7 +/- 0.2 mg/dL and a mean urine output of 140 +/- 15 ml on postoperative day 7.Life-supporting kidney transplantation in cynomolgus macaques is a demanding operation that requires great attention to details. Precise surgical techniques, telemetric monitoring, ultrasound surveillance, and aggressive, early, postoperative fluid resuscitation produced a 94% success rate.
