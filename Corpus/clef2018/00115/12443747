Percutaneous endovascular treatment for stenoses and occlusions of infrarenal aorta and aortoiliac bifurcation: midterm results. evaluation and comparison of the endovascular treatment of isolated aortic and aortoiliac atherosclerotic lesions (stenoses and occlusions).a percutaneous endovascular procedure was performed in 52 patients (38 men and 14 women) with a mean age of 52 years (range, 25-85 years). The baseline angiogram showed 35 aortic lesions (31 stenoses, 4 occlusions) and 17 aortoiliac lesions (14 stenoses, 3 occlusions). Percutaneous techniques used in this series included variable combinations of transluminal angioplasty and stenting. All stents placements were performed over-the-wire using the transfemoral route (most often bilateral approach). Clinical examination and Duplex-scan were performed at discharge, 1 month, 6 months, 12 months, and then yearly.technical success was 100% for aortic and aortoiliac lesions. Angiographic success rates were comparable for aortic (91%) and aortoiliac (94%) lesions. No death occurred during or early after the endovascular intervention. Duplex-scan confirmed 100% patency rate at discharge. There was no significant difference between the aortic (94%) and aortoiliac (96%) groups regarding immediate clinical improvement. Mean follow-up was 34+/-31 months (range, 0-130 months). The cumulative primary patency rate at 36 months was 85% in the aortic group and 86% in the aortoiliac group. Clinical success, defined as a symptom-free status at the end of follow-up, was also similar in both groups.endovascular treatment of isolated aortic lesions of the infra-renal aorta has favorable outcomes comparable to those of aortoiliac lesions.
