Technical consideration in the management of chronic mesenteric ischemia. Our aging population may result in a rise in the prevalence of chronic mesenteric ischemia. This report reviews our contemporary experience with a tailored surgical approach to chronic mesenteric ischemia. The medical records of 17 patients operated on for chronic mesenteric ischemia were retrospectively reviewed. Symptom-free survival and long-term patency documented by duplex scanning when available were also analyzed. Sixteen patients ranging in age from 32 to 80 years were included in the study. Seventy-five per cent of the patients were female. The most common preoperative complaints were postprandial abdominal pain and weight loss. Revascularization was tailored to the arterial anatomy and included bypass to the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) alone (eight), bypass to the celiac artery and SMA (six), SMA reimplantation onto the aorta (one), SMA/inferior mesenteric artery reimplantation (one), and transaortic endarterectomy of the celiac artery/SMA (one). Bypass conduits included Dacron (eight), saphenous vein (four), and polytetrafluoroethylene (two). Bypass grafts originated from the supraceliac aorta in 12 patients the remaining bypass originated from the left limb of an aortofemoral graft. There was one perioperative death (mortality 5.6%). Follow-up duplex scans at a mean of 34 months (range 1-114) showed no graft thromboses. We conclude that a variety of surgical techniques can provide durable relief of mesenteric ischemia. A tailored approach to revascularization optimizes patency and provides long-term symptom-free survival.
