Comparison of Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) and Duplex Ultrasound Arterial Mapping (DUAM) prior to infrainguinal arterial reconstruction. the purpose of this study is to compare Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) to Duplex Ultrasound Arterial Mapping (DUAM) and intraoperative findings to determine the clinical, accuracy of MRA for planning lower extremity revascularization procedures.forty-two patients who underwent lower extremity revascularization procedures had both MRA and DUAM evaluations. These data were analyzed retrospectively and two distinct endpoints were considered. First, we compared the MRA and DUAM findings for aorto-iliac, femoral-popliteal and infra-popliteal segments to intraoperative findings and evaluated the degree to which they agreed. Second, if there was a disagreement between imaging modalities, it was established whether a change in operative procedure would have resulted.MRA and DUAM findings agreed in 26 of 31 cases (83%) of aorto-iliac segments, in 25 of 31 cases (81%) of femoral-popliteal segments, and in 16 of 21 cases (76%) of infra-popliteal segments. In total, DUAM agreed with intraoperative findings in 98% of cases while MRA agreed in 82% (p<.001). Disagreement between intraoperative findings and DUAM lead to an alternate surgical procedure in only one case (2%) while disagreement with MRA lead to a different procedure in 38% of cases (p<.001).these data show that MRA is not yet adequate to replace conventional angiography and is less accurate that DUAM. Further improvements are necessary before MRA can be used as the sole modality for formulation of a pre-operative plan for lower extremity revascularization.
