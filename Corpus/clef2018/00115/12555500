Which indications and techniques for lower limb arteriopathy obliterans and proximal aorto-iliac lesions?. Atherosclerotic aorto iliac occlusive disease are not the most frequent lesions in the lower limbs. Isolated aortic iliac lesions are often associated with intermittent claudication critical ischemia with proximal aorto iliac lesions can be due to acute occlusion or associated femoropopliteal occlusive lesions. Preoperative explorations need Duplex Scan, Arteriography and CT Scan to define extensive lesions and wall' calcifications. Endovascular procedures are, in this lesion, safe, effective and permit to delay conventional surgery. The best strategy, today, needs to known endovascular procedures and surgical procedures to obtain the most efficient anatomic result.
