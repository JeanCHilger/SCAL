Accuracy of three-dimensional simulation in the sizing of aortic endoluminal devices. The purpose of this study is to examine the accuracy of a 3D simulation generated by inclusion of various intensity-selected portions of spiral CT data into a proprietary software program (Preview, Medical Media Systems, MMS) in preoperative and postoperative assessment of the anatomical features of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The accuracy of this software was measured against two other modalities-intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and axial CT scan-using the IVUS as the reference. Eighty-five patients were included 43 underwent AAA endovascular exclusion with Talent devices, and 42 with Aneurx devices. Measurement of proximal neck diameter was performed using IVUS, Preview software, and axial CT scan with manual calipers. Measurement of the AAA maximum diameter was performed using Preview software and axial CT scan
