Hepatic artery aneurysm. Hepatic artery aneurysms are rare. It is also very uncommon to diagnose a hepatic artery aneurysm prior to rupture. We report a 53-year-old woman who presented with symptoms of gallstones, and was later diagnosed as having hepatic artery aneurysm. Abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography showed two cystic lesions located at the hepatoduodenal ligament. Color Doppler and arteriography identified two aneurysms situated at the common hepatic artery and at the bifurcation of gastroduodenal artery, respectively. A saphenous vein graft was interposed between the origin of the common hepatic artery and the bifurcation of the right and left hepatic arteries. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on the seventh postoperative day.
