Post-sternotomy internal mammary arteriovenous fistula. Arteriovenous fistula from the mammary artery is a rare complication following cardiac surgery. The fistula usually develops within the first 2 weeks after surgery and is initially asymptomatic. Typically, a continuous machinery murmur is heard along the parasternal border of the chest wall. A patient with an arteriovenous fistula between the right internal mammary artery and mammary vein following a combined aortic valve and coronary bypass operation is described. A transthoracic colour Doppler scan led to the diagnosis of the fistula. Because of potential late complications endovascular embolisation of the fistula was successfully performed.
