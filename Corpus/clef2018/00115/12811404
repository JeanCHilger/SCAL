Dislocation of the closing element of the disk mechanical graft at aortic valve replacement. Presented herein is the first case of dislocation of the closing element of the artificial low-profile aortic valve to the abdominal aorta, which happened during replacement. Toward completion of extracorporeal circulation a 37-year-old man showed the signs of aortic insufficiency because of dislocation of the closing element. After resumption of extracorporeal circulation repeated replacement was accomplished. To detect the site of graft cusp embolism, transesophageal echocardiography and duplex scanning of the abdominal aorta were employed. On the 18th day following the first intervention the patient developed thromboembolism to the distal arterial bed. Emergency thrombectomy from the arteries of the right lower extremity was performed and a foreign body was removed from the abdominal aorta, using left-sided thoracophrenolumbotomy. The patient was discharged from the clinic in a satisfactory condition.
