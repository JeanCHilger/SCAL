Ultrasound measurement of aortic diameters in rodent models of aneurysm disease. This investigation was undertaken to evaluate transabdominal ultrasound (US) measurements of aortic diameters in rats and mice as a complementary method to video microscopy (VM), the current standard for assessing the diameter of rodent aortas.Aortic diameters were measured in 64 rats (n = 132 sets) and 12 mice (n = 36 sets) following experimental induction of aortic aneurysms. Diameters were measured at the renal vein, midinfrarenal aorta, and aortic bifurcation.In the rat, anteroposterior (AP) US measurements were closely correlated with transverse VM measurements, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.66 to 0.77 (P < 0.0001) for axial US images and 0.58 to 0.63 (P < 0.0001) for sagittal US images. In the mouse, significant correlation coefficients were 0.57 (P < 0.001) near the renal vein and 0.44 (P = 0.007) at the midinfrarenal aorta. Aortic diameters increased significantly with increasing animal age and weight (R = 0.40, P = 0.003 at the renal vein, R = 0.29, P = 0.04 in the midinfrarenal aorta, and R = 0.39, P = 0.004 at the aortic bifurcation), suggesting that weight matched rodents must be used to define aortic dimensions in treatment groups as opposed to repeated comparisons with baseline measurements in a growing rat.Noninvasive aortic US measurements throughout the course of a rodent study of aneurysmal disease provide a practical alternative to VM for the repeated determinations of aortic diameters.
