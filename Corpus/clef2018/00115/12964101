Diarrhea after vascular reconstruction of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. A 60-year-old man had a dacron aortofemoral bypass graft inserted to replace a ruptured infrarenal aortic aneurysm rupture. He subsequently had tachyarrhythmic atrial fibrillation with heart failure, NYHA class IV, and diffuse abdominal pain associated with watery diarrhea.Stool tests merely demonstrated Candida albicans. Abdominal ultrasound revealed intestinal loops with thickened walls and decreased peristalsis. Coloscopy demonstrated a retroperitoneal intestinal perforation with abscess formation resulting from ulcerative necrotizing rectosigmoid colitis which had also uncovered the vascular prosthesis near the abscess cavity.Ischemic transmural necrotizing rectosigmoiditis with retroperitoneal intestinal perforation.The rectosigmoid colon was resected and an end-colostomy made with closure of the rectal stump (Hartmann's operation). The uncovered right limb of the vascular graft was covered completely and was discharged, being now mobile using a walking frame. There was no evidence of infection in the dacron prosthesis.A transmural progression of an ischemic colitis should be considered as a late sequela after emergency vascular reconstruction of the abdominal aorta. Even if symptoms are mild, early postoperative sigmoidoscopy is indicated.
