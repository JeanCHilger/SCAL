Diagnosis of aortic pseudoaneurysm by echocardiography. The diagnosis of pseudoaneurysm of the ascending aorta is of paramount importance because of its propensity to rupture. As the frequency of surgical procedures involving the aortic root and valve increases, an increase in the incidence of aortic pseudoaneurysm may be anticipated. We recently studied a patient who developed pseudoaneurysm of the ascending aorta following repair of a Type I aortic dissection, utilizing a composite graft. Two-dimensional echocardiography with color flow and pulsed Doppler imaging showed a large perigraft cavity communicating with the aorta. Echocardiography provides a safe noninvasive diagnostic tool for the evaluation of the aorta postoperatively and for screening for pseudoaneurysm formation in the follow-up period.
