Non-invasive monitoring of cardiac output changes during aortic cross-clamping for infrarenal reconstruction--a new technique using suprasternal Doppler-derived cardiac output. There is a significant morbidity and mortality associated with elective infrarenal aortic reconstruction. To examine the value of continuous cardiac output monitoring for predicting those at risk, 40 consecutive patients were monitored using Doppler-derived cardiac output. The anaesthetist was blind to all information from the monitor and managed the patients using standard techniques. In 28 patients there were no observed changes, while in seven, cardiac output rose after aortic cross-clamping. In five patients a fall in cardiac output occurred after cross-clamping. No cardiac events or cardiac deaths occurred in the 35 patients who showed a rise or no change in cardiac output. However, there were three cardiac events, including one cardiac death in the group of five patients in whom a fall in cardiac output was observed. It would appear that intraoperative non-invasive Doppler-derived cardiac output monitoring successfully predicts high-risk patients who would perhaps benefit from more intensive pre-, peri- and postoperative care.
