False aneurysms after aortic operations. Between 1980 and August 1991, we encountered 11 non-infected aortic pseudoaneurysms after aortic surgery. The interval between the initial operation and revision varied from 1.8 to 26.8 years (mean 15.2 years). Three were found more than 20 years after operation. Pulling off of and degrading of the silk sutures were considered to be the causes. All patients underwent operative correction without mortality. In thoracic aortic pseudoaneurysm repair, a temporary bypass between the right axillary artery and left external iliac artery was generally adopted. There was no need for heparinization with this technique.
