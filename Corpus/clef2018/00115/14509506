Popliteal aneurysm: diagnostic workup and results of surgical treatment. Untreated popliteal aneurysm (PA) may cause serious complications. Early detection and surgery are beneficial. What are the circumstances under which the diagnosis of PA is made? What risks are associated with the treatment? A total of 36 consecutive PAs in 22 men and 2 women were treated in a single-center series. Altogether, 26 surgical reconstructions (group 1) were performed using a medial approach, and two PAs were resected through a dorsal approach. Eight patients with eight PAs did not undergo surgery (group 2): Two were awaiting surgery, and six had refused it. At the time of diagnosis, 25 PAs were symptomatic: local pain, swelling, or "pulsation" in the popliteal groove (29%) claudication of the foot/calf (39%)
