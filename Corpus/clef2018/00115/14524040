Endotension leading to aneurysm sac rupture following open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm. Endotension leading to enlargement of the aneurysm sac following the endoluminal grafting is still handled as an exclusive phenomenon of the endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). We report on a case with aneurysm sac enlargement caused by endotension leading to aneurysm rupture after conventional, open aneurysm repair, a so far not described complication. In a 74-year-old patient, following open surgical standard resection and reconstruction of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, a routinely performed abdominal ultra-sonography demonstrated a slowly growing enlargement of the peri-prosthetic aneurysm sac without endoleak. During the pre-operative work-up of the cardiac and pulmonary risk profiles, he complained of abdominal pain and back pain. Control CT revealed contrast inside the aneurysm sac as well as in the right-sided retroperitoneum. At the emergency operation a retroperitoneal haematoma was noticed. Opening the ballooned aneurysm sac, a fresh haematoma was also found. Lifting up the prosthesis, back bleeding at the dorsal circumference of the proximal anastomosis was confirmed due to a 2 cm long disruption of the anastomosis. In patients who present with abdominal or back pain after conventional surgery of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, a contrast CT should be performed to exclude an endoleak as well as other pathologies. The enlargement of the aneurysm sac without endoleak could be interpreted as endotension, with the consequence of urgent re-operation to prevent rupture.
