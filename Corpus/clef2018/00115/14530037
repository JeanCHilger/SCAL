Preoperative construction of an extracranial arterial shunt for resection of an aortic arch aneurysm with occluded left carotid artery. A 68-year-old man with aortic arch aneurysm was referred to our department. Preoperative carotid echography and magnetic resonance angiography revealed occlusion of the left internal carotid artery. Single-photon emission computed tomography scanning indicated that cerebral blood flow was decreased and reactivity to acetazolamide was reduced in the left temporal lobe. A successful superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis was first made by neurosurgeons. A postoperative single-photon emission computed tomography scan showed that cerebral blood flow and reactivity to acetazolamide were remarkably improved. Two months after the anastomosis, the aortic arch aneurysm was successfully repaired.
