Long-term outcomes of balloon angioplasty for aortic coarctation. From 1994 to 2001 balloon angioplasty was fulfilled for 19 patients aged from 4 to 28 (mean 11.0+/-7.0) with discrete type aortic coarctation. Early outcomes were satisfactory in all cases. Catheterization showed 10 mm Hg decrease in systolic pressure gradient (SPG). Long-term results (from 6 months to 8 years, mean 3.0+/-2.5) were evaluated with transthoracic EchoCG, Doppler ultrasound, duplex scanning of iliofemoral segment and CT-angiography with 3D reconstruction. Surgical outcomes were considered good when SPG did not exceed 20 mm Hg for Doppler ultrasound and 25 mm Hg for Doppler EchoCG. In the study group there was statistically significant decrease in arterial pressure in right upper limb and SPG (measured with both Doppler EchoCG and Doppler ultrasonography) and rise of ankle-brachial index. Beneficial hemodynamic effect was detected in 15 from 19 patients (79%). Recoarctation has developed in 4 (21%) patients, in 1 (5.3%) case it was combined with true posttraumatic aortic aneurysm. Three patients underwent open surgical intervention with uneventful postoperative period. Aneurysmal dilatation of thoracic aorta has developed in 1 patient (5.3%), non-progressive intimal dissection - in another one (5.3%), 2 patients (10.5%) experienced ipsilateral 40-60% stenosis of right external iliac and femoral arteries. Thus good long-term outcomes of balloon angioplasty in patients with discrete type aortic coarctation were achieved in 79% cases. Patients after balloon angioplasty must be assessed regularly with non-invasive diagnostic methods such as Doppler ultrasonography, Doppler EchoCG, CT-angiography.
