Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia after aorto-iliac reconstruction of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm: report of a case. We report a case of nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI), which developed after Y-grafting for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). A 71-year-old man was referred to our hospital with severe abdominal pain and signs of shock. Computed tomography revealed a ruptured AAA, and emergency aneurysmectomy and aortic grafting were performed. However, on postoperative day 7, a large amount of pus was seen oozing from the surgical wound. An emergency laparotomy revealed segmental, highly diffuse necrotic changes of the small intestine, but pulsation of the marginal artery in the necrotic region was palpable and blood flow was well audible by Doppler ultrasound. These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of NOMI.
