Effect of statins on the progression of bioprosthetic aortic valve degeneration. To date, there is no proved medical therapy able to significantly reduce the degenerative process of biologic prosthetic aortic valves. It has recently been suggested that statins may reduce the progression of native aortic valve stenosis. We examined the effect of statin treatment on bioprosthetic aortic valve degeneration and found a beneficial effect of statins in slowing bioprosthetic degeneration.
