Aneurysm of the subrenal aorta. Comments on 25 cases seen. The authors report their experience in the diagnosis and treatment of subrenal aortic aneurysms. The incidence of the abdominal aortic aneurysms, in aged population, is increasing, linked, in 95% of cases, to atherosclerotic disease. The diagnosis is essentially clinical with help of various examination techniques, that provide an accurate preoperative morphological assessment, like direct X-ray of the abdomen, echography, angio computerized axial tomography and arteriography. The moment for operating aneurysms of the subrenal aorta is discussed. The rate of operative deaths following elective replacement of abdominal aortic aneurysms is less than 4% and it increase to 40-80% in emergency replacement for rupture. Rupture remains a catastrophic life-threatening complication for cardiovascular, respiratory and renal failure, in spite of improved surgical techniques and postoperative intensive care.
