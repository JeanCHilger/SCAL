Doppler microembolic signals during cardiopulmonary bypass: comparison of two membrane oxygenators. We undertook this study to evaluate the dependence of Doppler microembolic signal (MES) counts, detected during cardiopulmonary bypass, on the type of oxygenator used. A total of 90 patients, 71 men and 19 women, aged 60 +/- 10 years (mean +/- SD), undergoing elective cardiac surgery for coronary artery bypass grafting (one vessel, n = 6 two vessels, n = 24
