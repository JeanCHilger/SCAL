Transcatheter closure of ruptured sinus of valsalva aneurysm. Percutaneous transcatheter closure of ruptured sinus of valsalva aneurysm was attempted in eight patients between January 1995 and March 2003 as an alternative strategy to surgery as this technique at present is an accepted therapeutic modality for various intracardiac defects. The age range was 14-35 years, all were male, seven in symptomatic class III and one in class IV on medical treatment. Two-dimensional and color Doppler echocardiography revealed rupture of an aneurysm of right coronary sinus into right ventricle in five and noncoronary sinus into right atrium in three and none had associated ventricular septal defect. The echo estimated size of the defect was 7-12 mm. On cardiac catheterization left ventricular end-diastolic pressure ranged from 20 to 40 mmHg and the calculated Qp/Qs ratio was 2-3.5. In all patients the defect was crossed retrogradely from the aortic side and over an arterio-venous wire loop after balloon sizing, devices were successfully deployed by antegrade venous approach (Rashkind umbrella device in two and Amplatzer occluders in six, which included Amplatzer duct occluder in five and Amplatzer septal occluder in one). One patient who had residual shunt developed hemolysis on the next day and was taken up for reintervention. That patient continued to have intermittent hemolysis and was sent for surgical repair. On follow-up (2-96 months), there was no device embolization, infective endocarditis, and aortic regurgitation. One patient died of progressive congestive heart failure while other six are asymptomatic. These data highlight that transcatheter closure is feasible and effective, especially safe with the available Amplatzer devices. Definitely, it has the advantage of obviating open heart surgery but complete occlusion is mandatory to prevent hemolysis and infective endocarditis.
