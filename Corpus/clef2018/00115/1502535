Possibilities and limits of biplane transesophageal echocardiography in dissection of the thoracic aorta. Dissecting aneurysms of the thoracic aorta can be rapidly and accurately diagnosed by transoesophageal echocardiography. The recent advent of the transoesophageal echocardiographic probe with transverse and longitudinal imaging transducers that add orthogonal viewing planes is an important advance in the evaluation of both the anatomic and haemodynamic status of the patient. It allows a still better understanding of the pathologic changes and therefore helps in surgical decision making. With the capabilities of colour flow Doppler, biplane transoesophageal echocardiography proves to be an ideal tool for the preoperative confirmation of the suspected diagnosis, intraoperative assessment and post-operative ambulatory follow-up and should be applied whenever possible.
