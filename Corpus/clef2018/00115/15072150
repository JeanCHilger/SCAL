Spectral waveform analysis of major arteries in conscious dogs by Doppler ultrasonography. Normal values of arterial blood flow velocity and waveforms in major arteries of 10 healthy conscious Beagle dogs were determined using Doppler ultrasonography. Peak systolic, early diastolic, and end-diastolic velocities of the basilar artery, common carotid artery, abdominal aorta, external iliac artery, femoral artery, and peak ejection velocity of the valvular aorta were evaluated. Pulsatility index (PI) of the basilar artery and blood pressure were recorded. All arteries had a high-resistance flow pattern with triphasic flow velocity except the basilar artery, which had a low-resistance pattern. Mean peak systolic velocities of the basilar artery, common carotid artery, abdominal aorta, external iliac artery, and femoral artery were 72 +/- 19, 115 +/- 17, 121 +/- 24, 105 +/- 25, and 110 +/- 17 cm/s, respectively. The PI of the basilar artery and peak ejection velocity of the valvular aorta were 1.37 +/- 0.13 and 96 +/- 16 cm/s, respectively. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 137 +/- 13 and 78 +/- 15 mmHg, respectively. Present findings may be used as references in future studies on vascular diseases and hemodynamics in dogs.
