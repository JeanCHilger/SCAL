Doppler echocardiographic and morphologic evaluation of patients following operative repair of aortic coarctation. Sixty-six patients operated on previously for coarctation of the aorta were included in the study. There were 50 children and 16 adults. Invasive and non-invasive gradients were recorded. Anatomical obstruction was evaluated by angiography in 54 patients and the numbers and size of collaterals were quantified. The closest correlation was found between Doppler-estimated gradients and invasive peak-instantaneous gradients (r = 0.87). The relation between anatomical obstruction and invasive peak-to-peak gradients, Doppler gradients and diastolic flow ere discouraging (r = 0.64, 0.54 and 0.35). Liberal indications for angiography or magnetic resonance tomography are recommended.
