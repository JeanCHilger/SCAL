Bilateral renal angiomyolipoma. Operative approach in a case with Wunderlich syndrome. After a wide-ranging review of the literature on the topic, the case of a 33-year-old woman is reported who, after an emergency right nephrectomy performed six years earlier due to renal angiomyolipoma with Wunderlich's syndrome, was admitted with anemia and acute shock following left renal hemorrhage. Having overcome the acute stage, a number of tests were carried out (echography, urography, abdominal CT, aortography) before the patient underwent conservative surgery in the form of lower heminephrectomy. The postoperative urography is presented showing satisfactory residual renal function which enabled the patient to live normally. The Authors discuss the criteria which lead them to select conservative surgical treatment.
