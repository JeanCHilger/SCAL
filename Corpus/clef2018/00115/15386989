Intestinal and colonic ischaemia in the surgery of subdiaphragmatic aorta. Ischemic colitis resulting in colonic infarction after aortic reconstruction is a highly lethal complication. The etiology and pathogenesis of this condition demonstrate that in many instances it may be prevented. Early recognition, particularly of the transmural ischemic injury is essential. Numerous techniques used during surgery for assessing the adequacy of colonic perfusion have been evaluated and found to be inaccurate in terms of predicting colonic ischemia. The purpose of this study is to assess the main monitoring technique for prediction of ischemic colitis during aortic surgery as: colonic mesenteric Doppler signal, inferior mesenteric arteries stump pressure, sigmoidal intramucosal pH and measurement of mucosal capillary haemoglobin oxygen saturation by reflectance spectrophotometry. A 15-year experience with 1912 patients undergoing abdominal aortic reconstruction was reviewed to determined both the incidence of intestinal ischemia and the clinical anatomic, and technical factors associated with this complication of aortic surgery
