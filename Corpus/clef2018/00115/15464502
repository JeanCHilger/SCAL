Bovine valved xenograft in pulmonary position: medium-term follow-up with excellent hemodynamics and freedom from calcification. This study was designed to evaluate the outcome of Contegra xenograft valved conduit (Contegra, Medtronic Inc, Minneapolis, MN).From April 1999 to December 2003, 67 patients with a mean age of 16.1 +/-15.0 years (2 months to 53 years) and a mean weight of 39.7 +/- 27.1 kg (4 to 95 kg) were discharged after implantation of a Contegra conduit. The diagnosis contained the following: pulmonary valve replacement during Ross operation (n = 27), pulmonary valve regurgitation (n = 9), tetralogy of Fallot (n = 7), pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect (n = 7), double outlet right ventricle (n = 7), truncus arteriosus (n = 5), Taussig-Bing (n = 2), obstructed conduit (n = 2), and double discordance (n = 1). Conduit size was 14 mm in 2, 16 mm in 7, 18 mm in 12, 20 mm in 13, and 22 mm in 33 patients. Mean cardiopulmonary bypass was 155 +/- 48 min (65 to 337 min) and mean aortic cross clamping was 69 +/- 38 min (0 to 146 min). All patients underwent echocardiography, 23 of 67 (34%) patients had cardiac catheterization, and 23 of 67 (34%) patients had electrocardiograph-gated multislice computer tomography.In a mean follow-up of 26.4 months (1 to 56 months) there was one late death (1 of 67 patients 1.5% mortality) unrelated to the conduit. Five patients underwent reoperationThe Contegra valved conduit provided excellent morphology and hemodynamics, and freedom from calcification in a medium-term follow-up.
