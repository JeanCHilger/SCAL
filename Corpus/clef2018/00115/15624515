Breast arterial calcifications as an indicator of systemic vascular disease. To evaluate the association between mammographically detected arterial calcifications and systemic vascular disease.The medical records of 77 women who had either breast arterial calcifications or underwent surgery for carotid stenosis, abdominal aortic aneurysm, or femoropopliteal bypass (study groups A and B) were evaluated and compared with 33 women without breast arterial calcifications (group C). Patients in both arms of the study underwent additional vascular tests or mammography.Currently available data indicate that there is a statistically significant correlation between the presence of arterial calcifications on the mammogram and atheromatosis of the carotid or femoral arteries.Screening mammograms might be useful in the detection of women at risk for systemic vascular disease.
