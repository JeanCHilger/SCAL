Increased growth rate of abdominal aortic aneurysms in women. The Troms√∏ study. The present study was undertaken in order to assess the effect of gender on the growth rate of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs).One hundred and eighty-five men and 49 women with AAAs were studied, mean follow-up 62 months, giving 14,544 patient-months of follow-up. A mean of 16 ultrasound examinations was performed on each patient.The mean growth rate was 1.82 1.65 and 2.43 mm per year in men and women, respectively. In a weighted linear regression analysis, high initial diameter and female gender were independent and significant (p < 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively) predictors for increased growth rate of AAAs. None of the other considered risk factors predicted the growth rate.This is the first study to report a significantly different growth rate of AAAs in females compared to males. It, thus, adds evidence to the view that AAA is a more malignant condition in females than in males and could have implications for the frequency of follow-up in women.
