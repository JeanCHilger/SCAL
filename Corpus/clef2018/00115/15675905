Review of branch aortic injuries in blunt chest trauma. To review the incidence, mechanisms of injury, diagnosis and treatment of injuries to the major branches of the thoracic aorta within the thoracic cavity following blunt trauma.Medline, Embase and Cochrane were searched using appropriate key word and MeSH headings. Full text articles were retrieved where there was any information relating to the mechanism of injury, incidence of injury, diagnosis, treatment or outcome in patients with injuries to the brachiocephalic, subclavian or carotid arteries within the thoracic cavity following blunt chest trauma.The reported incidence of these injuries varied widely, most injuries were related to rapid deceleration injuries or falls. Diagnosis depends on a high level of clinic suspicion and appropriate investigations include helical CT scanning and arteriography. Treatment options have expanded in recent years with the use of endovascular stents however, the optimal treatment remains uncertain.Aortic branch injuries must be actively excluded in patients with suspicious mechanisms of injury. Guidelines determining appropriate investigative pathways and methods of treatment should be developed at all trauma centres.
