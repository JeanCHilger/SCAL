Type II lumbar endoleaks: hemodynamic differentiation by contrast-enhanced ultrasound scanning and influence on aneurysm enlargement after endovascular aneurysm repair. The objective of this study was to differentiate type II lumbar endoleaks on the basis of dynamic features identified by contrast-enhanced ultrasound scanning (CUS) and to evaluate the role of this differentiation in detecting abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) enlargement > or =1 mL/mo.Eighteen male patients (mean age, 71.8 years) with type II lumbar endoleak suspected at CUS underwent computed tomography angiography (CTA) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). On CTA, AAA volumes and endoleak visualization and volume were assessed. At CUS, performed after a bolus of 1.5 to 2.4 mL of a second generation blood pool contrast agent, the following parameters were evaluated: presence of contrast material within the aneurysmal sac (endoleak), delay of endoleak detection (wash-in) and disappearance (washout) from the beginning of contrast injection, visualization of inflow and outflow vessels, and presence of cavity filling. Statistical analysis was performed regarding endoleak features at CUS, endoleak detection at CTA, and rate of AAA enlargement.DSA confirmed all the endoleaks. Mean +/- standard deviation wash-in and washout times were 121.9 +/- 132.6 and 337.2 +/- 193.7 seconds, respectively a significant relation was observed between these two parameters (P < .01, analysis of variance). By Youden plots, endoleaks were classified as hyperdynamic when wash-in was <100 seconds (n = 10, 55.5%) and/or washout was <520 seconds (n = 13, 72.2%). A slower washout was associated with nonvisualized outflow (66.7%) and/or inflow arteries (66.7%) ( P < .05). Eight endoleaks (44.4%) were missed at CTAType II lumbar endoleaks show different hemodynamic features at CUS, which might influence the rate of aneurysm enlargement, addressing the need for treatment.
