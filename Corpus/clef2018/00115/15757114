Influence of normovolemic anemia on Doppler characteristics of the abdominal aorta and splanchnic vessels in Beagles. To ultrasonographically evaluate hemodynamics in the abdominal aorta (AAo) and splanchnic vessels in dogs with experimentally induced normovolemic anemia.11 healthy Beagles.The AAo, cranial mesenteric artery (CMA), celiac artery (CA), hilar splenic artery (HSA), and main portal vein (MPV) were evaluated in conscious dogs immediately before and after experimental induction of severe normovolemic anemia (Hct, 16%) and during recovery from moderate and mild anemia (Hct, 26% and 34%, respectively). Peak systolic velocity (PSV) or peak velocity (PV), time-averaged mean velocity (TAVmean), pulsatility index (PI), resistive index (RI), blood flow, congestion index (CI), and heart rate (HR) were recorded. Results were compared for anemic and control states.Severe anemia caused significant increases in HR (25% to 70%), PSV (AAo, 45.8% CMA, 56.1%Doppler ultrasonography revealed hyperdynamic circulation in the AAo and splanchnic vessels in dogs with experimentally induced normovolemic anemia.
