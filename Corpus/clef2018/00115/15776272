Thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic vascular injuries. This paper reviews the surgical management of vascular injuries. Precise clinical and ultrasound evaluation is mandatory during the first steps of emergency treatment. For further documentation of the extent and site of arterial injuries in hemodynamically stable patients, computed tomography and angiography are crucial in differential diagnosis. Especially during the acute phase, the latter is indicated for evaluating the interventional therapy. The key to successful treatment of vascular injuries is immediate surgical control of hemorrhaging vessels.
