Comparative evaluation of small-size Sorin Slimline and St. Jude HP heart valve prostheses. The Sorin Slimline aortic valve prosthesis, a modification of the Sorin Bicarbon valve with increased internal orifice diameter and geometric orifice area, may show improved hemodynamic performance when compared with other previous prosthesis, but so far no comparison study has been reported.Between May 1999 and March 2002, 80 patients (31 to 81 years of age mean, 65 years) with a small aortic annulus were randomized to undergo aortic valve replacement with either the Sorin Slimline (n = 40) or St. Jude High Performance (n = 40) valve prosthesis. Clinical and echocardiographic Doppler follow-up was performed at 3 to 4 weeks, and 6 and 12 months postoperatively.One patient died of non-valve-related causes 9 months after operation. Mean and peak pressure gradients at 6 and 12 months in the Sorin Slimline valve were lower than in the St. Jude High Performance valve for both size 19 and 21 mm. Effective orifice area and effective orifice area index were not significantly different. There was a significant (p = 0.0001) reduction in left ventricular mass and left ventricular mass index between preoperative measurements and at 12 months after surgery for both valves, but there was no difference (p = 0.27) between the Sorin Slimline and St. Jude High Performance valve prosthesis at any other follow-up period. Clinical results showed similarly good results with both valves.No clinically significant difference in the hemodynamics of both valves was appreciated patients with a Sorin Slimline valve exhibited statistically significantly lower pressure gradients, but the small differences in effective orifice area and effective orifice area index did not reach significance. A significant left ventricular mass regression was observed with both valve models. Both prostheses provided a satisfactory clinical outcome.
