Does sac size matter? Findings based on surgical exploration of excluded abdominal aortic aneurysms. To prospectively examine the outcomes of excluded abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) that continue to expand without evidence of endoleak.From 1984 to 1998, 1218 patients underwent operative retroperitoneal exclusion of AAA and aortoiliac reconstructions. During the procedure, the aneurysm sac was ligated proximally, as well as distally, which created an ideal in-vivo model of excluded AAA sacs with or without endoleaks. From January 2002 to June 2003, 15 of these patients were identified as having an increase in AAA sac size with or without an endoleak on duplex ultrasonography. These patients were prospectively evaluated by computed tomography and diagnostic arteriography. Patients with a demonstrable endoleak underwent embolization, and the remainder underwent open surgical exploration.Eight patients had arteriographically demonstrated endoleaks that were treated with coil embolization. The remaining 7 patients (6 men mean age 76 years, range 68-81) without a demonstrable endoleak underwent elective surgical exploration and sac endoaneurysmorrhaphy. The mean time interval between the original surgery and aneurysm sac exploration was 76 months (range 52-92)Continued expansion of excluded AAA sacs can occur from causes other than a missed endoleak. Exudation of fluid from thickened sac wall and vasa vasorum, as well as local enzymatic activity, might lead to the formation of a sac hygroma. Furthermore, these findings raise questions as to the need for surgical exploration of all patients with an enlarging AAA sac in the setting of low sac pressures and no definable endoleak.
