Occult vascular lesions in patients with atherothrombotic events: the AIRVAG cohort. To determine clinical parameters that could predict occult vascular lesions (OVL) in patients with symptomatic atherosclerosis.Prospective evaluation of 269 consecutive patients with symptomatic atherosclerosis (cerebral 32%, peripheral vascular 15%, and coronary 53%): complete laboratory, ultrasound exams (carotids, aorta, heart), ankle-brachial index. OVL were defined as: abdominal aortic aneurysm, carotid artery stenosis > 50%, or left ventricular segmental contraction abnormalities when affecting a different vascular bed from the symptomatic. Clinical predictors of OVL were evaluated by logistic regression analysis.OVL were found in 35 patients (13%): 12 abdominal aortic aneurysms, 21 carotid artery stenosis and 15 segmental left ventricular contraction abnormalities. OVL were associated with peripheral vascular disease (intermittent claudication or reduced ankle-brachial index), cigarette smoking, increased pulse pressure, microalbuminuria and hyperhomocysteinemia. By multivariate analysis, intermittent claudication (odds ratio 5.8 95% CI 2.6-12.8) and microalbuminuria (OR 4.2Clinical and subclinical peripheral vascular disease, as well as microalbuminuria are strong independent predictors of OVL in atherosclerotic patients. A screening study of OVL may be warranted in these patients.
