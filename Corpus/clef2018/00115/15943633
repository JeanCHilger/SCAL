Management of arterial stenosis affecting kidney graft perfusion: a single-centre study in 53 patients. We assessed clinical and duplex sonographic (CDS) findings, and outcome in patients with stenosis of the transplant renal artery (TRAS) or the aorto-iliac segment proximal to the graft (Prox-TRAS) treated with dilatation (PTA), stenting (PTAS) and surgery. From 1988 to 2002, of 1189 patients with renal transplantations, 117 underwent angiography. Fifty-three patients with TRAS (n = 37)/Prox-TRAS (n = 16) were found (4.4%). Clinical presentation included deterioration of hypertension (144 +/- 15/84 +/- 9, 157 +/- 22/90 +/- 10 mmHg p < 0.001), increase of creatinine (1.7 +/- 0.9, 2.5 +/- 1.3 mg/dL
