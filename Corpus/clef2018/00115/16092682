Surgical complications after kidney transplantation. Research based on 185 cases. To analyze the incidence of surgical complications its diagnosis and treatment after renal transplantation.A retrospective study measuring the incidence of surgical complications and reviewing its diagnosis and treatment in 185 renal single transplants.185 transplants, 27% had surgical complications. Only one patient lost the graft due to surgical complications and there was no associated mortality. Cold ischemia time 20 hours. Double J stenting in 19%, under surgeon's opinion. Vascular complications 3.2% (all of them renal artery stenosis). Urological complications 6.4%. Perinephric haematoma 7%. Lymphocele 4.9%. Peritoneum related complications 4%. Other 4%. The diagnosis was clinical and radiological in most of cases. 14% needed any kind of intervention.Our results are similar to those reported in other recent series. Only one surgical team involved and the same technique for vascular and vesico-ureteric anastomosis probably makes lower our complications rate. Early postoperative abdominal ultrasonography contributes to the diagnosis of surgical complications. The initial treatment approach is the endoscopic-conservative one, with exceptions.
