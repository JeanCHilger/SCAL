Endoscopic palliation of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Endoscopic therapies have become an indispensable modality in the treatment and palliation of complications from pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This review focuses on treatment of biliary obstruction, malignant gastric outlet obstruction, and intractable abdominal pain resulting from unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Novel and emerging endoscopic approaches are also briefly discussed.Endoscopic placement of a biliary stent is the modality of choice for palliation of biliary obstruction. Biliary self-expanding metal stents should be placed if expected survival is more than 6 months and plastic stents if expected survival is less than 6 months. For endoscopic palliation of gastric outlet obstruction, enteral self-expanding metal stents should be placed. Biliary self-expanding metal stents should be considered prior to the placement of a duodenal stent. Palliation of intractable abdominal pain can safely be performed with endoscopic ultrasound-guided celiac plexus neurolysis using bupivacaine and absolute alcohol. Exciting novel endoscopic approaches are being evaluated especially in the area of drug-eluted biliary stents, endoscopic creations of enteral anastomoses, and endoscopic ultrasound-guided injection of gene vectors.The frontier of endoscopic palliative therapies for pancreatic adenocarcinoma is expanding. Clinical trials are needed to evaluate novel endoscopic approaches.
