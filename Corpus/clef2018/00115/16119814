Simultaneous bilateral testicular tumors with different cell types: a case report. A 22-year-old man presented to our out-patient clinic with the chief complaint of a painless mass in the right scrotum and lymph node swelling around the abdominal aorta in October, 2002. The bilateral testicular tumors were palpated and visualized by ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (right phi5 cm, left phi2 cm in diameter). Computed tomography revealed a metastatic lymph node around the abdominal aorta (3 x 3 x 10 cm in size). He underwent bilateral radical orchiectomy after frozen storage. Enucleation of the left testicular tumor was not performed because of its irregular demarcation. Histological examination revealed typical seminoma of the right testis and embryonal carcinoma of the left testis. Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection was performed after 4 courses of systematic chemotherapy (bleomycin, etoposide, platinum). No viable tumor cells were present histologically in the excised lymph nodes. The postoperative course was good and uneventful at 16 months under androgen replacement therapy without disease recurrence.
