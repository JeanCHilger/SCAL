Diagnostic value of multiplanar CT reconstructions in the assessment of abdominal aortic aneurysms. The increased use of ultrasonography and computed tomography result in the increased number of detected aneurysms, especially with relatively small diameters so the prevalence of the abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) is increasing. The aim of the study was to assess the usefulness of multiplanar (MPR) CT reconstructions in the evaluation of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Material comprises a group of 30 patients with the abdominal aortic aneurysm. There were 22 men and eight women, aged between 54 and 78 years (mean age was 62 years). In all the patients the CT examination of the abdominal aorta was performed. The diameter of the aortic aneurysm, measured using computed tomography scans and the rate of growth are the most important determinants of the risk of rupture, and in determining when elective repair is justified. The exact measurements of the aortic aneurysm are required. The tortuous aorta is clearly visible on MPR reconstruction, which enables choosing the proper axial section to measure the true diameter of the aneurysm. The exact measurement of the aneurysm length, possible on MPR sections is essential in determining the rate of aneurysm growth. The presence and size of thrombus correlate with the risk of aneurysm rupture. The MPR reconstructions enable exact measurements of the thrombus length. The visualization of aortic bifurcation is better on MPR reconstructions in coronal plane. The beginning of the dissection in some patients is visible only on MPR images. An MPR reconstruction provides additional information in CT examination of abdominal aortic aneurysm and should be performed in each CT examination of aortic aneurysms.
