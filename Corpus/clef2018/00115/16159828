How to guide stent-graft implantation in type B aortic dissection? Comparison of angiography, transesophageal echocardiography, and intravascular ultrasound. Despite growing interest in stent-graft implantation for type-B aortic dissection, there are no established recommendations to prepare and perform an implantation procedure.We directly compared angiography (ANGIO), transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) intraprocedually before and after placement of 48 stent grafts in 42 consecutive patients (12 women, 61+/-11 years of age) with acute and chronic type-B aortic dissection for both usefulness and capability to guide aortic stent-graft implantation. Both IVUS and TEE are superior to ANGIO to identify multiple entries (52 and 43 versus 34 P<0.005 each), to diagnose false-lumen slow flow after stent-graft implantation (32 and 31 versus 24TEE in conjunction with ANGIO appears to be advantageous and adds incremental information to safely guide stent-graft placement in type-B aortic dissection. Additional use of IVUS was found to be helpful in patients with complex anatomy and abdominal extension of the dissection.
