Doppler echocardiographic profile and indexes in the evaluation of aortic coarctation in patients before and after stenting. We sought to assess the effect of successful stenting on the Doppler profile of aortic coarctation and to identify echocardiographic indexes that could be used for follow-up of such patients.Doppler echocardiography demonstrates characteristic flow patterns in significant aortic coarctation.We undertook retrospective echocardiographic analyses before and at six to nine months after coarctation stenting in consecutive patients from 2002 to 2003. Peak systolic pressure gradient (SPG), diastolic velocity (DV), end-diastolic tail velocity (EDTV), systolic velocity half-time index (SVHTi) and diastolic velocity half-time index (DVHTi), and systolic pressure half-time index (SPHTi) and diastolic pressure half-time index (DPHTi) were measured. The severity of aortic coarctation was compared with cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging using the coarctation index (CoAi).The patient cohort was divided into two groups: group 1 (13 patients age 30 +/- 8 years), which consisted of patients with significant aortic coarctation treated with stenting, and group 2 (11 patientsAfter stenting, peak SPG, DV, and pressure half-time indexes (i.e., DVHTi and DPHTi) decreased significantly. These findings can confidently be used in the follow-up of coarctation patients after stenting, particularly in those with limited two-dimensional images.
