Carpentier-Edwards supra-annular aortic porcine bioprosthesis: clinical performance over 20 years. Experience with the Carpentier-Edwards supra-annular porcine bioprosthesis (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, Calif) has been evaluated longitudinally over 20 years. Clinical performance was evaluated by actuarial and actual analysis. Hemodynamic performance was evaluated by echocardiographic/Doppler assessment. Morphology of structural failure was evaluated from pathologic examinations.From 1981 through 1999, 1823 patients (mean age, 68.9 +/- 10.9 years range, 19-89 years) underwent 1847 procedures. Concomitant coronary artery bypass was performed in 788 (42.7%) patients. Previous valve procedures were performed in 107 (5.8%) patients, and other cardiac procedures were performed in 87 (4.7%) patients.The overall valve-related complication rate was 4.36% per patient-year (630 patients), with a fatality rate of 0.96% per patient-year (139 patients). Patient survival at 18 years was 15.8% +/- 1.6%. Overall late mortality rate was 6.3% per patient-year. Overall actual cumulative freedom at 18 years from reoperation was 85.0% +/- 1.2%, valve-related mortality was 88.7% +/- 1.1%, and valve-related residual morbidity was 96.3% +/- 5.0%. Actual freedom from structural valve deterioration at 18 years was 86.4% +/- 1.2% overall, 90.5% +/- 1.8% for age 61 to 70 years, and 98.2% +/- 0.6% for age greater than 70 years. Structural valve deterioration presented with pathologic evidence consistent with stenosis in 27.6% and insufficiency in 72.4%. Hemodynamic performance at 1 year revealed normal effective orifice area indexes for sizes 23 to 27 mm and mild-to-moderate reduction for size 21 mm.The Carpentier-Edwards supra-annular aortic porcine bioprosthesis continues to provide excellent freedom from structural valve deterioration and overall freedom from valve-related residual morbidity, mortality, and reoperation up to 18 years. Hemodynamic performance is satisfactory. The prosthesis remains recommended for patients older than 70 years and for patients 61 to 70 years of age, especially when comorbid risk factors are not anticipated to provide extended survival.
