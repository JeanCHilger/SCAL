Asymptomatic aortic dissection associated with a mitral prosthetic leak: a clinical case report. A case of aortic dissection ("DeBakey type III") in an asymptomatic 78-year-old woman is described. The patient underwent a mitral valve replacement (bioprosthesis Sorin) in June 1990 for severe mitral stenosis in October 1990 she was admitted to our hospital for severe dyspnea and cardiac failure with good response to medical treatment. The routine echo color Doppler examination showed only a hint of paraprosthetic leak, which required further investigation by transesophageal echocardiography. This approach revealed the presence of a regurgitant jet extending from the prosthetic mitral valve toward the atrial septum. The examination of the thoracic aorta revealed the presence of a dissection flap
