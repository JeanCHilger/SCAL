Emergency diagnostic paracentesis to determine intraperitoneal fluid identity discovered on bedside ultrasound of unstable patients. Patients presenting with hypotension may be evaluated with a FAST (Focused Abdominal Sonography for Trauma) examination as recent literature has suggested its utility in the unstable patient. Those who are found to have intraperitoneal fluid on the FAST examination may have solid organ injury from unknown trauma, ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), hemorrhaging ovarian cyst, ruptured ectopic pregnancy, or other disease process responsible for intra-periteal blood. However, because ultrasound does not assist in fluid identification, it is possible that the fluid present is not blood, but ascites. Further, a decision may need to be made regarding emergent surgical intervention or blood transfusion vs. aggressive fluid resuscitation or pressors followed by other testing such as computed tomography. This case series illustrates the utility of an ultrasound guided, emergent diagnostic paracentesis in the management of unstable patients found to have a positive FAST examination. Six unstable patients were evaluated with the FAST examination and found to have large quantities of intraperitoneal fluid. In each case the fluid was sampled and proposed management changed due to fluid identification.
