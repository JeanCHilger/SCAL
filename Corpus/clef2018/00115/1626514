Hemodynamic evaluation by Doppler echocardiography of small (less than or equal to 21 mm) prostheses and bioprostheses in the aortic valve position. To assess resting hemodynamics of an unselected group of patients with prostheses or bioprostheses sized less than or equal to 21 mm implanted into the aortic valve position during a 7-year period, 46 of 50 eligible patients were examined by Doppler echocardiography. The valves were Carpentier-Edwards (CE) supraannular 21 mm (n = 8), Medtronic-Hall (MH) 20 mm (n = 8) and 21 mm (n = 21), and the rest (n = 9) were other valves with only 1 to 3 patients in each group. Gradients, valve areas and dimensionless obstruction indexes (ratio of subvalvular/valvular velocities and velocity time integrals) were compared. By analysis of variance, gradients did not differ significantly between the CE supraannular 21 mm, the MH 20 and 21 mm prostheses (peak/mean 25 +/- 8/14 +/- 5, 31 +/- 13/16 +/- 6 and 25 +/- 10/13 +/- 5 mm Hg p = not significant). Only 2 patients had a mean gradient greater than 25 mm Hg. The valve area was slightly larger for the MH 21 mm group compared with the CE supraannular 21 mm group (1.34 +/- 0.15 vs 1.16 +/- 0.14 cm2, p less than 0.05). The dimensionless obstruction indexes did not differ (CE supraannular 21 mm 0.36 +/- 0.07/0.40 +/- 0.07 (velocities/velocity time integrals), MH 20 mm 0.40 +/- 0.12/0.47 +/- 0.12, MH 21 mm 0.38 +/- 0.05/0.44 +/- 0.06
