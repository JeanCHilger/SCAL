Cerebral protection during open retrograde angioplasty/stenting of common carotid and innominate artery stenoses. This was a retrospective study of the effectiveness of open, retrograde angioplasty/stenting of supra-aortic arterial stenoses combined with transcranial Doppler-directed dextran therapy in preventing perioperative embolization.Eight patients underwent angioplasty/stenting of the proximal common carotid (synchronous carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in six), while four underwent angioplasty/stenting of the innominate artery (synchronous CEA in one). Open exposure of the carotid bifurcation enabled temporary carotid clamping to protect the brain from procedural embolization. Dextran was administered to patients with a high rate of embolization on transcranial Doppler after the operation.No emboli were recorded in the cerebral circulation during the actual angioplasty procedure when the internal carotid artery was clamped. After operation three patients developed high-rate embolization and received dextran. No strokes or deaths occurred within 30 days of treatment. One patient developed symptoms and a recurrent stenosis greater than 50 per cent during follow-up and was treated by redo angioplasty.Retrograde angioplasty/stenting with or without synchronous CEA offers an alternative approach to treating patients with supra-aortic inflow disease.
