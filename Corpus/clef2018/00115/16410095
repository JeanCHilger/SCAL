Endobronchial migration of prosthetic patch after congenital diaphragmatic hernia repair. Surgical repair of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) can be performed by means of either direct suturing of the diaphragm or positioning of a prosthetic patch. However, half of all prosthetic patches show evidence of reherniation. We describe the case of an 8-year-old girl who presented with prosthesis dislocation and fistulization in the right lower bronchus as a complication of a CDH repair that she underwent when she was 1 year old. Abdominal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging suggested a hernia relapse, whereas chest computed tomographic scan failed to identify the diaphragmatic defect. Only fibrobronchoscopy allowed fistulization of the prosthesis into the bronchi to be correctly diagnosed.
