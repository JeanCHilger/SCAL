The role of multi-slice spiral CT angiography in patient management after endovascular therapy. To bring out the role of multi-slice spiral CT angiography (MS-CTA) in patient management after endovascular therapy of subclavian artery stenosis.Twenty-one consecutive patients with clinically suspected restenosis after endovascular treatment of subclavian artery stenosis or occlusion were included in the study. Eleven patients had been treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) alone and 10 with PTA and stenting. The mean follow-up period after PTA or stenting was 57 (+/-27 SD) months. CTA was performed using a bolus-triggered high-resolution protocol with biphasic intravenous contrast medium injection. Axial images and curved planar reformations (CPRs) were rated by three readers with regard to patency of supra-aortic vessels. Imaging findings were correlated with a standardized clinical assessment.All examinations were of diagnostic quality. Of 21 referred patients, 7 had significant reobstruction of the treated subclavian artery. Six of the 7 patients with significant restenosis on CTA were treated conservatively (antiplatelet agents), despite 2 of them being symptomatic on the standardized clinical assessment, which showed a sensitivity and specificity of 86% in predicting stenosis. One patient was treated with PTA and stent deployment because of strong subjective suffering.MS-CTA is useful for exclusion or quantification of clinically suspected restenosis in carefully selected patients after endovascular therapy where ultrasound is inconclusive and/or contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography is contraindicated.
