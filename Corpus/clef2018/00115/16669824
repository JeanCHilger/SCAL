Intra-aortic stent graft in oesophageal carcinoma invading the aorta. Prophylaxis for fatal haemorrhage. In patients with advanced oesophageal carcinoma with aortic invasion, any therapy potentially causes fatal haemorrhage. We describe here the successful application of intra-aortic stent graft to prevent haemorrhage before radical oesophagectomy for advanced oesophageal cancer. Four patients with advanced oesophageal cancer complicated by invasion of the aorta. Under general anaesthesia, aortic invasion is evaluated by an intravascular sonography. The stent graft is passed through the right femoral artery into the descending aorta. Subsequently, the stent graft is released to expand in the thoracic aorta during an artificial cardiac arrest. Aortography is performed to check for any stent migration or endoleakage. This procedure was successful in all four patients without any complications. All patients underwent radical oesophagectomy following aortic stent-grafting. One patient survived more than 2 years after stent grafting and operation. This procedure is safe and applicable for the patient with aortic invasion before radiochemotherapy or operation.
