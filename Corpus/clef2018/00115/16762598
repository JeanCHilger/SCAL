Use of intra-cardiac ultrasound in the diagnosis of prosthetic valve malfunction. A 46-year old lady was under regular follow up for aortic valve replacement done in 2002 for aortic stenosis. The valve was a Carbomedics 19 mm bi-leaflet aortic valve prosthesis for which she had adequate anticoagulation since implantation. She had a past history of end stage renal failure, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease and systemic lupus erythematosus. She was asymptomatic and had a routine transthoracic echocardiogram performed which revealed that her aortic valve prosthesis was well seated with an elevated velocity across the valve the aortic valve leaflets were poorly visualised but appeared to be mobile. A transoesophageal echocardiogram (TOE) confirmed the markedly increased forward velocity across the aortic valve (maximum velocity 4.6 m/s) with small aortic root raising the possibility of pressure recovery phenomenon. Once again the leaflets were not clearly seen but appeared mobile despite the use of deep trans-gastric view. Fluoroscopy was performed and revealed that one of the leaflets was not moving. The patient had an intra-cardiac ultrasound scan (ACUSON AcuNav
