Real-time vascular interventional magnetic resonance imaging: the future of aortic stent-graft placement? Endovascular stent-graft placement is emerging as a promising alternative to medical and surgical treatment of patients with diseases of the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta. Precise placement of the stentgraft, which is currently performed under x-ray control, remains, however, challenging as there are several shortcomings to fluoroscopic guidance beyond that related to the harmful effect of radiation exposure and nephrotoxic contrast media. While transesophageal echocardiography and intravascular ultrasound have been used as adjunct imaging modalities during endovascular stent-graft procedures to overcome the limitations of angiography, these techniques have not mitigated the need for fluoroscopy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance of vascular interventional procedures offers several potential advantages over fluoroscopy-guided techniques, including image acquisition in any desired orientation, superior 3D soft-tissue contrast with simultaneous visualization of the interventional device, absence of ionizing radiation, and avoidance of nephrotoxic contrast media. Magnetic resonance imaging is often used for pre-operative diagnosis of aortic disease and can provide all relevant information for the planning of endovascular stent-graft procedures as well as for accurate and immediate post-interventional evaluation. However, visualization of interventional instruments by MRI has proven to be the chief obstacle. This article will review current approaches that have been developed for depicting vascular instruments by MRI and will also discuss the first experimental experiences with MRI-guided endovascular stent-graft placement in a swine model of aortic dissection.
