Predictors of failure of endovascular therapy for peripheral arterial disease. The objective of this study was to assess the usefulness of a comparison of clinical failure and restenosis rates of endovascular procedures at 1 year in patients with peripheral arterial disease. The resulting comparison is presented as "clinical failure/restenosis coordinate." The authors screened 171 papers describing the outcome of lower extremity angioplasty or stent placement. In 20 of them, authors reported detailed outcomes of interest, including baseline demographic measurements, location of arterial occlusive lesions, a measure of restenosis (measured by ankle-brachial indices, ultrasonography, or angiography), and clinical outcomes (mortality, repeat percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, or amputation). An overview of these 20 angioplasty papers was performed. Besides the usual meta-analyses of each end point separately, data were also plotted as coordinates of clinical failure versus restenosis. The clinical failure-to-restenosis coordinate was calculated and reported for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the aortoiliac and femoropopliteal distributions. Clinically reported outcomes in the literature were used to calculate the clinical failure/restenosis coordinate. This value was significantly different for various locations of the angioplasty and various baseline angiographic characteristics. A numeric coordinate pair of clinical failure and restenosis is identifiable in patients undergoing endovascular treatment of peripheral arterial disease. The varying coordinates may be important in elucidating the incidence and mechanisms of clinical failure after endovascular treatment. The coordinate reported in this article is hypothesis-generating about mechanisms of endovascular treatment failure. This coordinate is important in determining the role of restenosis in the clinical failure of endovascular therapy of peripheral arterial disease.
