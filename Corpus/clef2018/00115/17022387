Unusual retrograde aortic arch dissection during percutaneous coronary intervention: A case report. Coronary dissection is one of the most frequently occurring complications during coronary interventional procedures. However, extensive coronary dissection retrograde to the coronary sinus of Valsalva and to the arch of aorta is very rarely observed. The authors report a case of retrograde coronary dissection extending into the arch of aorta. Management and coronary angiography at 6-month follow-up are discussed.
