Early graft thrombosis after endovascular aortic aneurysm repair with aortouni-iliac endografts. Endovascular repair of aortic aneurysm has become a viable treatment option in selected patients. However, despite the minimally invasive nature ot this treatment a significant incidence of vascular complications has been reported. Here, we report two cases of acute limbs ischemia due to endograft thrombosis in patients treated with aortouni-iliac devices and we review the etiologic factors related with these events and the treatment options. We suggest that the presence of atherosclerotic plaques within the outflow arteries and coexistent infrainguinal arterial occlusive disease (poor runoff) is an underestimated factor in the risk of graft thrombosis, especially in patients treated with aortouni-iliac devices and we advocate the use in the early follow-up surveillance after endovascular repair of aortic aneurysm of noninvasive test such duplex scanning, segmental pressures and ankle-brachial indices to asses the presence or progress of coexistent occlusive disease. We also suggest that some adverse outcomes ascribed to device failure might be more properly charged to inappropriate patient selection.
