Detecting endoleaks in aortic endografts using contrast-enhanced sonography. We performed this pilot study to investigate the utility of contrast-enhanced sonography for the detection of endoleaks in patients with abdominal aortic endografts.Contrast-enhanced sonography evaluation of abdominal aortic endografts is a technically feasible alternative to our current practice standard.
