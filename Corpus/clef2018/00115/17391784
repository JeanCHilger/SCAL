Role of three-dimensional multidetector computed tomography for a huge superior mesenteric artery aneurysm management. Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) aneurysms are the third most common visceral artery aneurysms. Diagnosis of SMA aneurysm can be achieved by abdominal ultrasonogram, postcontrast computed tomography (CT), three-dimensional (3-D) multidetector (MD) CT, or selective angiography of the SMA. 3-D MD CT may play an important role for the evaluation of characteristic morphology of SMA aneurysm and for delineation of the correct relationship between SMA aneurysm and other adjacent branches of the abdominal aorta. We report a case of huge SMA aneurysm visualized by 3-D MD CT images in detecting anatomic details and its role for the best surgical approach in a patient with huge SMA aneurysm.
