Imaging techniques for detection and management of endoleaks after endovascular aortic aneurysm repair. Endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) is evolving into a viable alternative to open surgical repair for many patients with abdominal and thoracic aortic aneurysms. Endoleak development is a complication of EVAR and represents one of the limitations of this procedure. Endoleaks represent blood flow outside the stent-graft lumen but within the aneurysm sac. Lifelong imaging surveillance of patients after EVAR is critical to detect endoleaks for the patient's benefit and to determine the long-term performance of the stent-graft. Although computed tomographic angiography is the most commonly used examination for imaging surveillance, magnetic resonance angiography, ultrasonography, and digital subtraction angiography all have a role in endoleak detection and management. This review will focus on imaging techniques used for endoleak detection and the role imaging surveillance plays in the overall care of the post-EVAR patient.
