Treatment of transplant ureteral stricture with Acucise endoureterotomy: case report and literature review. We report a patient who was diagnosed with end-stage renal disease and who received renal transplantation in her right iliac fossa in 2003. After transplantation, right hydronephrosis was noted on abdominal ultrasonography and right lower ureteral stricture was diagnosed by antegrade pyelography. She received ureter internal stent insertion three times, but hydronephrosis and urinary tract infection recurred after the stent was removed. Therefore, Acucise endoureterotomy was used to treat the recurrent ureteral stricture. The patient was discharged on the second postoperative day and abdominal ultrasonography revealed no hydronephrosis during regular follow-up.
