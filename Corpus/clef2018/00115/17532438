Valve-sparing operation for aortic root aneurysm late after Mustard procedure. The aortic valve reimplantation technique leads to excellent clinical outcome in patients with aortic valve incompetence and aneurysms of the ascending aorta. This technique is now applied for aneurysms of ascending aorta, aortic dissection type A, and even dilatation of pulmonary autograft after the Ross operation. We report a case of aortic root dilatation late after a Mustard operation for transposition of the great arteries that was successfully managed by valve-sparing aortic root reimplantation.
