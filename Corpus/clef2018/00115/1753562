Electric cardioversion after surgical correction of the mitral valve defect. Prognostic value of the two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography in the assessment of its long-term effectiveness. In 82 patients after mitral valve surgery (59--commissurotomy, 23--valve replacement--Bj√∂rk-Shiley or St. Jude prosthetic valve), 2-D and Doppler echocardiography were performed one day before electrical cardioversion. Regular sinus rhythm was maintained to 180 days in 28 patients (34%), over 180 days in 54 patients (66%). The statistical differences (p less than 0.05) between the following echocardiography parameters of these two groups were determined: parasternal long axis view: aortic, atrial, right and left ventricular dimensions (not significant--NS) apical four-chamber view: left and right atrial, left and right ventricular areas--NS
