Long-term postplacement cost after endovascular aneurysm repair. Previous studies have demonstrated that the initial hospital cost associated with endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is approximately $20,000. However, the cost of long-term surveillance and secondary procedures is poorly characterized.Between December 1998 and June 2006, 259 patients underwent EVAR for infrarenal aneurysms at a single institution. Follow-up costs were calculated using a relative value unit based hospital cost accounting system, which incorporates departmental direct and indirect costs. Institutional overhead costs were included using a conversion factor. Costs for professional services were determined by a cost-to-charge ratio, and outpatient visits were calculated with a time-based formula. Year 2006 costs were applied to prior years. To minimize costs associated with the early learning curve, the initial 50 EVAR patients between December 1995 and 1998 were excluded. Patients with <1 year follow-up were also excluded. Data are expressed as mean +/- standard error.The mean follow-up after EVAR for 136 patients was 34.7 +/- 1.8 months. The cumulative 5-year postplacement cost per patient was $11,351. The 27 patients (19.9%) who required secondary procedures had a 5-year cumulative cost of $31,696 compared with $3668 for 109 patients without secondary procedures (8.6-fold increase, P < .05). The 5-year cost for patients with endoleak was $26,739 compared with $5706 for those without endoleak (4.7-fold increase, P < .05). Overall, major cost components were 57.4% for secondary procedures and 32.5% for radiologic studies.During a 5-year period, the postplacement cost of EVAR increases the global cost by 44%. The subgroups of patients with endoleaks and those requiring secondary procedures generate a disproportionate share of postplacement costs. Efforts at minimizing cost should emphasize technical and device modifications aimed at reducing endoleaks and the need for secondary procedures.
