Effect of endovascular stenting of aortic coarctation on biventricular function in adults. To investigate the effect of endovascular stenting of aortic coarctation on biventricular function in adults during intermediate-term follow-up.21 patients (age 34 (10) years) were studied prospectively before and 14 (2) months after coarctation stenting from year 2002 to 2005. Biventricular function and blood pressure measurements were made. The post-stenting results were compared with pre-stenting values (group 1), with 22 age- and sex-matched post-surgical repair patients (group 2) and 30 normal controls (group 3).The peak systolic gradient across the coarctation site fell (55 (15) mm Hg to 18 (8) mm Hg, p<0.001). Systolic, mean blood pressure and left ventricular (LV) mass dropped after stenting (p<0.05 for all). LV long-axis function improved at intermediate-term follow-up (tissue Doppler imaging lateral and septal systolic and diastolic velocities and E/Em ratios: LSm, 6.5 (1.4) cm/s to 7.9 (1.7) cm/s SSm, 5.8 (1.2) cm/s to 7.3 (1.6) cm/sEndovascular stenting of aortic coarctation resulted in medium-term LV mass regression and long-axis function improvement that may provide insight into long-term outcome of the stented patients. The results support aortic stenting in patients with anatomically suitable defects, given the additional benefit of avoiding cardiopulmonary bypass. The clinical significance of subclinical myocardial dysfunction in patients with stented or repaired coarctation warrants further studies.
