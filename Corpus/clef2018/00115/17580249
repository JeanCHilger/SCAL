Physiologic monitoring data: will it change our follow-up paradigms? The purpose of endovascular aortic aneurysm repair is to depressurize the sac and to protect it from rupture. However, none of the imaging modality currently used during the follow-up period including CTA, MRA and duplex ultrasound can measure sac pressure. Noninvasive sac pressure monitoring using implantable sensors has the potential to provide a safe, reliable, cost-effective alternative for post-EVAR surveillance. The technology is compatible with all types of imaging, all types of implants, and allows clinicians to obtain physiologic data to supplement their assessment of the aneurysm repair. These devices may ultimately allow for measurements to be obtained at home, with an unlimited frequency without risk to the patient, added cost or complexity. We believe that not only is development of an intrasac transducer necessary, but it is a desirable adjunct to endovascular aneurysm repair, and an adjunct that might possibly eliminate some of the complex imaging protocols that are presently necessary over long-term follow-up.
