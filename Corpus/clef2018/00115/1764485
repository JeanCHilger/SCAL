Celiac artery aneurysms: case reports. Two recent patients with celiac artery aneurysms focus attention on the relevant diagnosis and therapeutic alternatives that lead to a successful outcome in these patients. Awareness of the nonspecific symptoms associated with splanchnic arterial aneurysms combined with ultrasonography, computerized axial tomography, and arteriography lead to the appropriate diagnosis of a celiac artery aneurysm prior to rupture and exsanguinating hemorrhage. Aneurysm resection offers a definitive means of treatment. Selective use of revascularization techniques bolsters the surgical approach by preventing hepatic ischemia and serving as an additional source of visceral arterial blood flow. Our use of an autogenous or prosthetic graft from the intrarenal abdominal aorta proved to be a helpful adjunctive technique. Long-term vigilance is important because of the association of celiac artery aneurysms with other arterial occlusive and aneurysmal disease.
