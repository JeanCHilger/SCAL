Sonographic measurement of abdominal aortic diameter: interobserver variability. Twenty-eight patients undergoing sonographic evaluation of the abdominal aorta were examined by two separate observers. Three measurements were obtained from each patient: the anteroposterior diameter from an axial image (APA), the right-left diameter from an axial image (RLA), and the anteroposterior diameter from a longitudinal image (APL). Calculation of the interobserver variability gave the following results (in mm): APL, 2.22 APA, 2.53
