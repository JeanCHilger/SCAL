A sinus of Valsalva aneurysm ruptured into the right atrium secondary to aortic endocarditis. The usefulness of transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography. We present a case of a sinus of Valsalva aneurysm ruptured into right atrium secondary to aortic endocarditis. Early surgical procedure was indicated bases on transthoracic echocardiography. This technique demonstrated a abscess image enlarged into the right atrium and color Doppler showed a turbulent flow from aortic valve to right atrium. Cardiac surgery was performed with transesophageal echocardiography monitoring. This technique allowed anatomical and functional aortic valve evaluation and the abscess location and extension. This case shows the value of transthoracic and transesophageal color Doppler echocardiography in the diagnosis and management of patients with complications secondary to infective endocarditis.
