An IVUS-based approach to traumatic aortic rupture, with a look at the lesion from inside. To review a single-institution experience with endovascular repair of acute traumatic aortic rupture (ATAR) performed on an emergency basis using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) exclusively as the navigation tool for stent-graft implantation (no arteriography).Between September 1998 and November 2006, 26 consecutive patients (19 men mean age 38+/-19 years, range 15 to 83) underwent endovascular repair of ATAR performed by a surgical team using IVUS and fluoroscopy for lesion characterization and stent-graft deployment guidance. Transesophageal echocardiography was routinely used in all patients to visualize the aortic lesion and rule out residual flow after device deployment. Sealing of the aortic tear was evaluated by postoperative contrast-enhanced computed tomography.IVUS revealed an extensive disruption of the tunica intima and media (>180 degrees ) in 46% (12/26) of patients the disruption was circumferential in 3 cases, with pseudocoarctation. The aortic diameter at the site of rupture measured 24+/-4 mm. Primary technical success was 92% (24/26)Endovascular repair of acute traumatic aortic disruption yields promising results, with high technical success and minimal procedure-related morbidity. IVUS as the primary navigation tool for device implantation allows prompt endovascular setup, instant aortic measurements, and precise visualization of the aortic disruption.
