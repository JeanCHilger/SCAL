Ureteroscopic management of lower-pole stones in a pediatric population. We report our experience with ureteroscopy to treat lower-pole calculi in children.A retrospective review was conducted of all ureteroscopic procedures for lower-pole stone disease at a pediatric institution from 2000 through 2005. A total of 13 girls and 8 boys with a mean age of 15 years (range 1-20 years) underwent flexible ureteroscopy for lower-pole calculi. The mean stone burden was 12 mm. Stone-free status was defined by postoperative abdominal radiography, CT, or ultrasonography.Ureteral stenting was performed preoperatively in 38% and postoperatively in 71% of the patients. Ureteral-access sheaths were placed in 43%. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. With a mean follow-up of 11 months, 76% of the children were stone-free. The success rate for stones <15 mm was 93% v 33% for stones > or =15 mm (P = 0.01).Ureteroscopy and laser lithotripsy are safe and effective in children with lower-pole calculi. Ureteroscopy can be considered a primary treatment option for children with lower-pole calculi <15 mm.
