Clinical requirements of aortic imaging. Modern imaging modalities, especially noninvasive cross-sectional imaging techniques, have advanced dramatically in recent years and are now the backbone of pre- and postoperative evaluation of aortic pathologies. The planning in particular, but also the aftercare following endovascular aortic reconstructions, make heavy demands on physicians. It is necessary to select the method of examination that is best suited to the pathology concerned and to apply it to the patient in an individual manner. Ultrasound is the examination of choice for screening and follow-up of infrarenal aneurysms. Transesophageal echocardiography and magnetic resonance angiography are used in diagnosis, in intraoperative navigation during the implantation of endografts and in follow-up of patients with thoracic aortic aneurysms and aortic dissections who have undergone conservative treatment, with very high sensitivity and specificity. The use of MRA is restricted by the long time needed for an examination, metal artifacts and limited availability. DSA has been largely superseded in the diagnosis of aortic pathologies by CTA, but as yet retains its role in intraoperative imaging of the anchorage regions of endoprostheses. Selective demonstration of postoperative internal leaks with subsequent therapeutic embolization is a further area of use for DSA. CTA, including so-called image postprocessing, has taken over the prime role in imaging of the aorta. Disease-specific diagnostic algorithms are useful and necessary in day-to-day clinical practice.
