Interdisciplinary approach to treatment of multiple arterial aneurysms in patient with eighth recurrence of incisional hernia--a case report. Vascular surgery is not the only option for arterial aneurysm treatment. Minimally invasive techniques are being increasingly used, especially methods of interventional radiology. We present a case of a 51-year-old man who came to our department in July 2005 because of sonographically diagnosed popliteal artery aneurysm. Simultaneous presence of subrenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, bilateral iliac and femoral artery aneurysms and left popliteal artery aneurysm was found. This patient was operated on for pancreatic pseudocyst in 2000 and then during next three years eight times for incisional hernia and its recurrences. The operations were carried out in other surgical departments. Eighth recurrence of incisional hernia was already present. Because of these facts, the risk of resection was deemed too high. Therefore, we chose stent graft implantation for abdominal aortic aneurysm treatment. The endovascular approach was also used to treat some complications that occurred. In this case report, we would like to present a combination of surgical and interventional radiological approaches to treatment of arterial aneurysms as a typical example of interdisciplinary cooperation.
