Use of Amplatzer Vascular Plug (AVP) in emergency embolisation: preliminary experience and review of literature. Amplatzer Vascular Plug (AVP) is a device recently proposed for extra-cardiac procedures such as arterial and venous embolisation. In this paper, we assess the usefulness of AVP in emergency embolisation presenting our preliminary experience and reviewing the Literature. During the last year, we selected 31 patients for embolisation using AVP. The following nine procedures were performed in emergency (8 males, mean 72.4 years, range 57-85): four ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, one traumatic hepatic pseudoaneurysm with arterio-portal fistula, one carotid pseudoaneurysm due to neoplastic erosion, one renal tumor with active bleeding, one ruptured isolated iliac aneurysm and one ruptured hypogastric aneurysm. We used a total of 13 AVPs. The follow-up was carried out by computed tomography angiography (CTA) and/or contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), 3 months after the procedure and then every 3 months. We obtained immediate technical success in all nine cases. No rupture or dissection of the treated arteries occurred. We observed only an asymptomatic spasm. During a mean follow-up of 5.3 months (range 3-12 months), CTA and/or CEUS showed complete occlusion of the treated arteries. The AVP is useful in some emergency settings. In the authors' experience, the device allows precise, controlled release and can be deployed to the target more rapidly than other traditional methods. The device cannot be used in all patients due to limited ability to negotiate tortuous vessels and limited size availability. In our institution, the AVP is less expensive than alternatives. In our experience and as reported in the early literature, the device is easy to use, versatile, and achieved a high technical success rate. Further studies may confirm the effectiveness and demonstrate additional indications.
