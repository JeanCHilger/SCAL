Outcome after mechanical aortic valve replacement in children and young adults. We asked whether aortic valve replacement using a mechanical prosthesis would allow normalization of left ventricular function and structure in children and young adults.We performed a clinical follow-up examination in 30 patients with aortic valve replacement at 25 years of age or younger, including conventional and tissue Doppler echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging.Aortic valve replacement was performed at the median age of 14.3 years (range, 7.6 to 24.3 years) using a mechanical prosthesis (St. Jude Medical median diameter, 23 mmAortic valve replacement in children and young adults offers a good treatment option and may lead to normalization of left ventricular size and function in most patients.
