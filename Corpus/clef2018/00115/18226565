The treatment of isolated iliac artery aneurysm in patients with non-aneurysmal aorta. The aim of the study was to evaluate early and mid-term results of surgical repair of isolated iliac artery aneurysm (IAA) in patients with non aneurysmal abdominal aorta.From January 1996 to December 2006, 34 patients with IAA had elective surgery. In 32 cases open repair was performed. Two patients had endovascular repair using a tube endoprosthesis and internal iliac artery coil embolization. The diameters of the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries were measured preoperatively and during follow-up. Early and late results in terms of mortality, major morbidity, reinterventions and graft-related complications were recorded. Mean pre and postoperative diameters of abdominal aorta were compared.The site of the IAA was the common iliac artery in 29 cases (10 bilateral), internal iliac artery in 4 cases and external iliac artery in 1 case. Preoperative mean abdominal aortic diameter was 22.2mm (SD 7.6). There were no perioperative deaths and two major complications (retroperitoneal bleeding and limb ischemia) occurred. At the median follow-up time of 24 months survival was estimated as 91%. No reinterventions, graft thrombosis and graft related complications occurred. There were no cases of abdominal aorta aneurysm development. Mean aortic diameter at the most recent imaging was 23.1mm, which was not significantly different from preoperative values (p=0.2).Surgical treatment of IAAs provides good early and mid-term results. During mid-term follow-up the diameter of abdominal aorta remains stable, suggesting IAA may be a localized aneurysmal disease.
