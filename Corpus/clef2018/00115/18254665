Endovascular thoracic aortic aneurysm repair: evaluating the utility of intravascular ultrasound measurements. To compare intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and computed tomography (CT) measurements of aortic diameter for the determination of stent-graft sizes used in thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR).A retrospective review was conducted of 71 IVUS measurements performed in 33 patients (17 men mean age 69 years) undergoing endovascular repair for thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA). For comparison, an inanimate model of the aortic arch and the great vessels was createdIn 47 (66%) of the 71 clinical measurements, IVUS yielded a value that was larger than the CT scan measurement in 8 (11%), the difference was at least 5 mm. In the model, CT centerline measurements were accurate within a mean 0.3 mm (0.6%) of the actual diameterIVUS measurements of the thoracic aorta were larger than CT measurements 66% of the time. However, there are 2 concerns with IVUS: off-center measurements distort the image and tangential measurements on a curve do not reflect a true centerline diameter. Thus, off-center IVUS measurements or those taken in the tortuous portion of the aorta may not be as accurate as centerline CT measurements.
