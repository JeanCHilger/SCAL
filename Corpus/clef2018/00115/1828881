Renovascular hypertension in childhood. One to two per cent of children and up to 11% of adolescent have arterial hypertension. In most cases children and adolescent are not recognized to be hypertensive because physicians do not routinely measure blood pressure. Often the diagnosis is recognized only when the pediatric patients develop a complication: seizure, stroke, heart failure or paraplegia. Renovascular hypertension in children and adolescents is more common than all of the other causes combined, except for coarctation of the aorta. The diagnosis is not so easy and includes the usual history, physical examination (signs and symptoms of coarctation of the isthmic or abdominal aorta or of an abdominal mass or of one of the adrenal causes of hypertension), laboratory studies, abdominal ultrasound study and chest x-ray. Sometime a CAT can be usefull. The next steps are the early and rapid-sequence IVP, renal angiography and peripheral and renal renin activity. The management of renovascular hypertension in children and adolescent includes a conservative approach (percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty or renal embolization), rarely used in pediatric age, and the surgical treatment. This latter includes all the surgical procedures of renal revascularization and, in unilateral renal parenchymal diseases, the nephrectomy or a partial nephrectomy. The postoperative results are very good in a high percentage of cases. In bilateral cases, the revascularization surgical procedures improve or normalize also the impaired renal function.
