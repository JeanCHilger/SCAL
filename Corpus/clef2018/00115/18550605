Built-in defect of a biological pericardial aortic prosthesis? We report a case on an early complication of a biological pericardial tissue valve in the aortic position that required emergency replacement. One of the three leaflets of the valve was stuck open in a fixed-open position and would not unfold in diastole. This resulted in severe aortic insufficiency, diagnosed by standard postoperatory echocardiography and confirmed in the operating room.
