The feasibility of using ultrasound and video laryngoscopy in a mobile telemedicine consult. Emergency healthcare systems in rural communities often have limited access to experienced trauma and emergency physicians. Advanced telecommunication technologies may offer an opportunity to help meet this need. We evaluated healthcare providers' satisfaction with the audio and visual components of an existing telemedicine system, and asked them whether emergency medical services (EMS) personnel could be supported via telemedicine guidance, using video laryngoscopy and ultrasonography, during vulnerable transport periods. Physicians and technologists at a central workstation were linked to a telemedicine-equipped ambulance providing real-time audio and visual communications during patient transport. A scoring system was created for system evaluation using a scale of 1-9. Seven evaluators observed ultrasonography of the carotid vessels and abdominal aorta. Nine evaluators observed an intubation with video laryngoscopy. These observers rated the quality of the images transmitted from the ambulance. Evaluators were asked if this telemedicine system would be suitable for telementoring advanced technical procedures. Mean rating for technical satisfaction with ultrasound was 5.1, the majority of evaluators estimated that they could telementor an abdominal ultrasound examination. The mean rating for technical satisfaction with laryngoscopy was 7.2 with 100% of evaluators estimating they could use the system to telementor intubation. The rating for laryngoscopy was significantly higher than for ultrasound (p = 0.01). Results of this study suggest that telemedicine may provide an advanced support mechanism for rural EMS personnel and patients. Procedures for advanced airway management and ultrasound diagnosis may someday be managed using a remote telepresence.
