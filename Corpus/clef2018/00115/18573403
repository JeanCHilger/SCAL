Results of a new surgical paradigm: endovascular repair for acute complicated type B aortic dissection. Conventional open repair of acute complicated type B aortic dissection is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This study examined the results of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) in acute type B aortic dissection complicated with rupture or malperfusion syndrome.From 2004 through 2007, 35 patients (22 men) with acute complicated type B aortic dissection were treated with TEVAR. Indications included rupture in 18 (51.4%) and malperfusion syndrome in 17 (48.6% mesenteric or renal, 5The mean age was 58.6 +/- 13.4 years. Technical success (coverage of the primary tear site) was achieved in 34 patients (97.1%). Coverage of the left subclavian artery was required in 25 patients (71.4%). Thirty-day mortality was 2.8%. One-year survival was 93.4% +/- 4.6%. Complications included permanent renal failure (2.8%), stroke (2.8%), spinal cord ischemia (transient [5.7%], permanent [(2.8%]), and vascular access (14.2%). The mean intensive care unit and hospital stay were 4.7 +/- 2.6 and 16.7 +/- 12.0 days, respectively.Endovascular repair of acute complicated type B aortic dissection is associated with low morbidity and mortality and has emerged as the surgical therapy of choice.
