Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy in an elderly population: how to prevent complications and make the treatment safe and effective. The aim of our study is to consider the feasibility and the results of shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) in an elderly cohort of patients, considering different diseases and concomitant morbidity.From January 2003 up to July 2006, a total of 1100 SWL treatments were performed in our Stone Centre with Dornier Lithotripter S device. We retrospectively analyzed all the treatments carried out in patients older than 70 years of age, collecting a total of 130 patients. The average age was 75.1 years (range: 70-89). Stone location was renal in 95 and ureteral in 45 patients. Information about SWL outcomes and complications were collected as well as patient's characteristics and treatment modalities.Average stone size was 10.2+/-3.4 and 8.7+/-3.1 for the renal and ureteral location, respectively. 73 out of 140 patients (52.1%) were stone free after a single treatment 49 patients (35%) required an adjunctive session, whereas SWL was unsuccessful in 18 (12.8%) patients. We observed 64, 24, 21, 10, 31 cases of concomitant arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, solitary kidney condition and previous neoplastic pathologies. A total of 8 and 6 subjects had previous cardiac surgery and atrial fibrillation respectively, thus requiring a warfarin scheduled conversion to low molecular weight heparin. Five patients had a pace maker implant and three patients an abdominal aortic aneurism. No SWL-related complications were found in this series considering both urological and systemic features.SWL represents the treatment of choice for urolithiasis, and it has to be recommended especially to geriatric patients. In those subjects, SWL complications can be avoided with a proper and personalized preparation, together with an ECG and ultrasound continuously monitored procedure.
