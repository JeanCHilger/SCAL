Aorto-iliac/femoral reconstructions in patients with vasculogenic impotence. One hundred and forty-eight patients out of 386 undergoing aorto-iliac or aortofemoral bypass had preoperative impotence, 37 of these were diabetics. In all of them Doppler studies revealed a penile/brachial pressure index less than 0.6 and an abnormal waveform analysis. Nocturnal penile tumescence was investigated in 44 cases and found to be abnormal. Angiography showed unilateral or bilateral obstructive lesions of the hypogastric arteries in 80%, in addition to aortic, common and external iliac and femoral lesions. One hundred and thirty patients (87.8%) had straight aorto-iliac/femoral bypass grafts inserted without a direct attempt to revascularise the hypogastric arteries but 24 had distal anastomoses to the bifurcation of the common iliac artery. In the remaining 18 patients the hypogastric artery was reconstructed on one side by an additional bypass or reimplantation on the graft. In 22 of 106 patients (20.7%) undergoing aortofemoral bypass, 18 of 24 (75%) with the distal anastomosis to the iliac bifurcation, and 14 of the 18 (77.7%) with revascularisation of the hypogastric arteries, erectile function was regained. A good result was obtained in only five of the diabetic patients (13.5%). Our experience suggests that: (1) impotence, as indicated by non-invasive investigations, was vasculogenic in origin since patients with the most effective revascularisation of the hypogastric arteries had the best results (2) when it is feasible, revascularisation of the hypogastric arteries should be carried out more often, during the aorto-iliac or aortofemoral reconstructions, particularly in younger impotent patients
