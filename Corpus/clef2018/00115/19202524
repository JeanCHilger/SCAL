Percutaneous aortic valve replacement in two cases at high surgical risk: procedural details and implications for patient selection. The morbidity and mortality burden of heart valve disease is increasing in the developing world, especially among the elderly. Whereas surgery remains the standard of care in fit patients with degenerative aortic stenosis, percutaneous aortic valve replacement could become an effective alternative to surgery in selected higher risk patients. The authors report on two women with aortic stenosis, both at high surgical risk (an 81-year-old female with coronary artery and cerebro-vascular disease, and a 70-year-old female with end-stage cirrhosis), in whom percutaneous valve replacement was effectively performed by means of transfemoral access and retrograde CoreValve Re-valving System implantation. Two major post-procedural complications occurred, both effectively managed, in the second patient: a third degree atrio-ventricular block (requiring permanent pace-maker implantation) and bleeding from the right femoral artery access (requiring implantation of two covered stents and blood transfusion). Despite the increased baseline risk, both patients were discharged asymptomatic, the first twelve days and the other three weeks after admission. In the authors' experience percutaneous aortic valve replacement can be performed with reasonable safety in patient with severe aortic stenosis at high surgical risk.
