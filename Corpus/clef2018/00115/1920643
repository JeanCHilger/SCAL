Abdominal aortic aneurysm in the patient undergoing cardiac transplantation. In the past 3 years at our institution 130 patients have undergone cardiac transplantation for ischemic cardiomyopathy in 49 (38%), idiopathic cardiomyopathy in 42 (32%), viral cardiomyopathy in 9 (6.9%), pulmonary hypertension in 8 (6%), and graft atherosclerosis in 2 (1.5%). Routine preoperative abdominal ultrasonography was performed on 98 (75%) of these patients with specific visualization of the abdominal aorta in 93 (95%). Abdominal aortic aneurysms (all infrarenal) were found before operation in four patients and only in the subgroup undergoing transplantation for ischemic heart disease (10.5%). They measured 3.4, 4.5, 3.6, and 3.8 cm before transplantation. Periodic evaluation by ultrasonography was carried out after transplantation during the 3-year period of this study. One aneurysm that was initially 3.6 cm increased to 4.0 cm and ruptured 2 months after transplantation. The patient died despite emergent surgery. Aneurysms in three patients who demonstrated rapid aneurysm expansion after transplantation were successfully repaired at 5, 20, and 33 months after transplantation when the lesions reached 5.5, 5.9, and 4.8 cm. A fifth patient with an initially normal (1.5 cm) aorta developed a symptomatic aneurysm of 4.1 cm, which was repaired uneventfully. The average expansion rate of these aneurysms after transplantation was 0.74 +/- 0.15 cm/year. This experience suggests that aneurysms are limited to patients undergoing transplantation for ischemic heart disease. Ultrasound examination may be appropriate for preoperative screening. Careful aortic surveillance after transplantation is important in patients having transplantation for ischemic cardiomyopathy because of the apparent rapid expansion rate compared to aneurysms in the population not receiving transplants.
