Initial experience characterizing a type I endoleak from velocity profiles using time-resolved three-dimensional phase-contrast MRI. We report the first utilization of time-resolved three-dimensional phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging, termed 4D flow, to image a type I endoleak after endovascular aneurysm repair. The combination of 4D flow and a traditional magnetic resonance angiogram can aid in the accurate detection and characterization of endoleaks by combining the three-dimensional resolution of cross-sectional imaging with the temporally resolved velocity data of Doppler ultrasound.
