Screening for aneurysm of the abdominal aorta: prevalence in patients with stroke or TIA. Population screening for aneurysms of the abdominal aorta (AAA) is still not implemented in any country, despite proven benefit both in decreased mortality and in cost effectiveness. Detecting a subpopulation with higher prevalence of AAA may alter this situation.Between 2002 and 2005, all patients with a stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) admitted to the department of Neurology of a community-based hospital were classified according to the Toast criteria and enrolled in a prospective study to assess the diameter of the abdominal aorta. The diameter was assessed by ultrasonography. A written questionnaire and blood tests were used to assess risk factors.The prevalence of AAA amongst the 499 screened patients in the study was 5.8% [95% confidence interval (CI) 5.6-6.0%]. Of the risk factors or Toast criteria, only male gender and age over 59 years correlated significantly with AAA. In the subgroup of 235 men aged over 59 years, the prevalence of AAA was 11.1% (95% CI 10.4-11.8%).The prevalence of AAA in men over 59 years of age presenting with a stroke or TIA is nearly twofold increased (11.1%) compared with all patients. Therefore, screening for AAA in this subgroup of patients seems beneficial. However, further studies are needed to confirm this finding and to explore the clinical benefit and cost effectiveness.
