The instrumental diagnosis of arterial diseases especially of arterial occlusive diseases. Ultrasound Doppler sonography is the most important tool in the assessment of peripheral arterial occlusive disease. The determination of systolic ankle pressure gives an useful overview of the degree of the disease. In a normotensive patient with a systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg systolic ankle pressures between 100 and 140 mm Hg are present when the occlusive disease is in the stage of good compensation. Severe claudication will appear with ankle pressures between 70 and 95 mm Hg, lower values are indicating a critical limb ischaemia. Treadmill exercise is helpful for documentation of painfree and maximal walking distances. When a patient is suggested to be treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or bypass surgery a duplex sonography or angiography is mandatory. In evaluating the Raynaud's phenomenon under the noninvasive techniques capillaroscopy of the nailfold is a useful tool. The diagnosis of thromboangiitis obliterans is usually established by clinical criterias. The radiographic findings may give important hints. In many cases of acute arterial occlusions angiography is necessary for finding the optimal therapy. The aneurysm of the abdominal aorta will be evaluated by ultrasound and computer tomography.
