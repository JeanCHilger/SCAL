Clinical application of autologous buccal micro-mucosa graft in vaginal reconstruction. OBJECTIVE To investigate the effect of vaginal reconstruction with autologous buccal micro-mucosa graft.From March 2007 and April 2008, 10 patients with absence of vagina were treated, aged 18-31 years (mean 26 years). Nine of them were congenital absence of vagina, and the remaining one was vaginal stenosis after vaginal reconstruction. They all exhibited normal secondary sexual characteristics, normal hormonal levels and 46, XX karyotype. Their abdominal ultrasonography revealed the normal ovaries and tubes but absence of the uterus or small rudimentary horns. However the one with vaginal stenosis had normal uterus. The buccal mucosa graft was minced into 0.5 mm in size and was transplanted to the cavity which was dissected between the bladder and the rectum.The operation was performed successfully in all cases. The operative time was about 1-2 hours and operative blood loss was 80-100 mL. Postoperative complication occurred in only one case for vaginal bleeding. The patient recovered and the wound healed well after immediate management. The others healed primarily without any complications. All cases were followed up for 4-16 months. The depth of neovagina which was formed was 6-10 cm and the width was about two fingers. The lining was pink-colored and smooth, and was confirmed as nonkeratinizing squamous stratified mucosa by histopathological examination. The donor sites healed uneventfully with no change in mouth opening. The perineal area was not disturbed. Four patients were married and satisfied with their sexual life without pain and bleeding.Vaginal reconstruction with autologous buccal micro-mucosa graft is an easy, minimally invasive and useful method.
