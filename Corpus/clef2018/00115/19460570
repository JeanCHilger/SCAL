Use of intraperitoneal ePTFE Gore dual-mesh plus in a giant incisional hernia after kidney transplantation: a case report. We evaluated the incidence of and predisposing factors for an incisional hernia after kidney transplantation. Numerous techniques have been used to repair postoperative fascial dehiscences or simple incisional hernias, but no clear treatment exists for giant hernias. Our aim was to obtain (1) a safe procedure to repair a large abdominal defect and reinforce the surrounding, fragile zones and (2) a simple, rapid technique to reduce the operative time. Herein we have described the surgical repair of a giant incisional hernia using intraperitoneal Gore ePTFE dual-mesh plus (Gore-Tex W. L. Gore, Flagstaff, Ariz, USA) in a 55-year-old man status-post renal transplantation. Total necrosis of distal graft ureter had caused a giant urinoma. The patient was reexplored on day 2 posttransplantation with a primary fascial approximation. Thirty days after transplantation we discovered a large incisional hernia and performed a repair. No drain was used. The patient continued immunosuppressive therapy (cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, prednisolone) and was discharged on postoperative day 4 with no complications. An ultrasonographic follow-up at 1 year revealed the prosthesis to be correctly positioned. Incisional hernia is not rare after renal transplantation but the real incidence is unknown. Immunosuppressive therapy, prolonged pretransplantation dialysis, obesity, and diabetes are probably the major causes of incisional hernias in these patients. Surgical complications of renal transplantation surgery, such as wound hematoma, urinoma, and lymphocele, are the most important predisposing factors for an incisional hernia. The use of intraperitoneal ePTFE dual-mesh is feasible, safe, and easy to repair a large incisional hernia in a kidney transplant patient.
