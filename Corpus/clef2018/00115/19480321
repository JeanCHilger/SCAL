Endovascular stent implantation for coarctation of the aorta in children and young adults: intermediate follow-up results from Turkey. The aim of this study was to report the intermediate follow-up results of stent implantation for coarctation of the aorta in children from Turkey. Patients with native or postoperative coarctation, who had abnormal flow at the descending aorta exceeding diastolic phase on Doppler echocardiography or upper extremity hypertension, underwent endovascular stent implantation. Ten patients with a mean age of 12.4 +/- 5.5 years (6-23 years) underwent stent implantation between January 2001 and September 2006. Of these, three had previous surgical repair, and the remainder were native coarctation. Palmaz, Genesis and Numed CP stents were used. All the implantations were successful and there was no major complication during the procedure. The follow-up period was 8-72 months and only one patient needed re-dilatation during this period. Stent implantation may be a feasible alternative to balloon angioplasty and surgery for adolescents. Patients who have previous surgical repair, high surgical risk, unfavorable anatomy, or refuse consent for surgical intervention are the best candidates for stent implantation. However, longer follow-up and new studies are necessary especially in younger patients.
