Aortobifemoral bypass grafting using expanded polytetrafluoroethylene stretch grafts in patients with occlusive atherosclerotic disease. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the performance of bifurcated, longitudinally extensible (stretch), expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) grafts implanted in patients with aortoiliac or aortofemoral occlusive atherosclerotic disease. Between October 1991 and December 2005, 822 consecutive patients (708 men, 114 women mean age 63.8 years) underwent aortoiliac or aortofemoral reconstruction using a bifurcated ePTFE stretch graft. Preoperatively, all patients had ultrasonographic and arteriographic evaluations and were divided into groups according to the TASC II morphological stratification of iliac lesions. Seventy-seven patients (9.4%) had type B lesions, 314 (38.2%) had type C lesions, and 431 (52.4%) were classified as type D lesions. Endarterectomy of the aorta was required in 172 patients (21%)
