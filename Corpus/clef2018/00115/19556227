Basic science review. Vascular distensibility as a predictive tool in the management of small asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysms. This study investigates whether baseline aortic wall distensibility serves as a supplemental bio-marker for AAA progression and need for later repair.In 1998, 61 males with a small asymptomatic AAAs had a baseline measurement of elasticity and stiffness, using an echo-tracking ultrasound system (Diamove). The cohort was followed till 2005 concerning Dmax, expansion rate, operations for AAA, hospitalisation do to cardiovascular disease and death.During follow-up, 49% died, and 45.9% were hospitalised do to cardiovascular disease, compared to Dmax, Ep and b no significant associations were found. Elasticity correlated moderately to annual expansion rate and Dmax. Good correlation was found between annual expansion rate and Dmax. ROC-curve analysis showed that elasticity, stiffness and Dmax all tended to predict future need for AAA-repair.Baseline aortic wall distensibility may provide an additional parameter for AAA to optimize the indication and time for elective repair.
