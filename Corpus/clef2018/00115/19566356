Ultrasonographic screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms in Iranian candidates for coronary artery bypass graft surgery. To evaluate the prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysm in Iranian candidates for coronary artery bypass graft surgery and its associated factors.Totally, 2843 consecutive candidates for coronary artery bypass graft surgery underwent ultrasonography of abdominal aorta. The relation between abdominal aortic aneurysm with gender, age, smoking, dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, and carotid and coronary stenosis was evaluated.The prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysm was 2.7% and 0.7% in men and women subgroups, respectively. The prevalence was 3.8% in men older than 65 years. The largest diameter of abdominal aortic aneurysm was 61.7 mm. Only two men had aneurysm larger than 55 mm, which led to changing their surgery schedule to stenting. Gender, age, smoking, smoking more than 40 years, diabetes , hypertension, and significant carotid stenosis were associated factors of abdominal aortic aneurysm.Compared with the results sited in Western studies, the prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysm is lower in Iran (P<0.0001). Its associated factors in our study were similar to previously published studies. Significant carotid stenosis, a factor not reported previously, was an associated factor in our study. Because of the low prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysm in our population, screening the candidates for coronary artery bypass graft surgery is not recommended.
