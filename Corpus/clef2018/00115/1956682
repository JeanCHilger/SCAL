Doppler echocardiography in the examination of normally functioning artificial mitral and aortic valves. Patients with prosthetic valves were investigated by Doppler echocardiography in 902 cases between November 1987 and February 1990. The parameters of 209 of 344 mitral and 258 of 299 aortic prosthetic valves were evaluated. No significant correlation was found between the type of aortic or mitral prosthetic valves and the measured gradient. As concerns the size of the valve and the measured gradient, a close correlation for aortic valve replacement was detected. For a normally functioning mitral prosthetic valve, a maximum early diastolic velocity of less than 2 m/s (16 mm Hg gradient) and a pressure half-time of less than 130 ms (mitral valve area 1.8 cm2) were characteristic. In cases of aortic valve replacements, the maximum velocity was less than 3 m/s (36 mm Hg gradient), except for the small-diameter valves. More than 95% of the cases met these criteria. (Even if small-diameter valves were included, a maximum velocity of more than 3 m/s occurred only in 8.9%.) Doppler echocardiography is a suitable tool for detecting normal prosthetic valve function, while colour Doppler allows the optimal alignment of jet direction and Doppler beam.
