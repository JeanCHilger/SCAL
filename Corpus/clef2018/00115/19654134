Rapid method for intraoperative assessment of aortic coarctation using three-dimensional echocardiography. The availability of three-dimensional (3D) echography with its multiplanar review analysis software on board now allows detailed examination in assessing morphological details. We evaluated the feasibility of 3D echography in assessing intraoperative morphological details of aortic coarctation (CoA) and its repair.Nine consecutive children scheduled for surgery of CoA were intraoperatively evaluated. Intraoperative 3D data sets were taken and analysed online before resection of the coarctation, showing the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the proximal aorta, coarctation, and the distal descending aorta. After resection of the coarctation and extended end-to-end anastomosis, a 3D data set was recorded to analyse the CSA of the anastomosis. In nine out of nine consecutive procedures, intraoperative 3D echography permitted comprehensive viewing and measuring of CoA and its repair. In three out of nine surgical procedures, intraoperative 3D echography provided additional information to support surgical decision-making.Intraoperative 3D echography is a feasible non-invasive imaging modality for intraoperative assessment of CoA and its repair, which provides useful additional information.
