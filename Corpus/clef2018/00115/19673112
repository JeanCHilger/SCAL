Immunomorphological reaction of organism in prosthetic plasty of the anterior abdominal wall using polypropylene mesh in patients, suffering postoperative abdominal hernia. Clinico-experimental studying the immunomorphological reactions variants in the prosthesis of anterior abdominal wall using synthetic polypropylene mesh was conducted. In 70 patients, operated on for postoperative hernia of abdominal wall using "on lay" method and the immune state were studied up by means of investigation of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines content, in part, of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-8, IL-4. Morphological investigations were conducted in experiment on 100 the Vistar line mices, there were studied reactions of fibroblasts, macrophages, lymphocytes and leucocytes. The results of the immunological and morphological reactions on polypropylene obtained trust the necessity of differentiated approach application for the choice of the synthetic prosthesis kind, taking into account its biocompatibility, physical properties, the hernial defect size etc.
