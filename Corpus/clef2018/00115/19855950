Imaging of endoleaks after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) with contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). Endoleaks following endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) are common and present a diagnostic challenge in the follow-up after EVAR. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is a promising new method for the diagnosis and follow-up of endoleaks. CEUS with SonoVue allows a rapid and non-invasive diagnosis in the follow-up after EVAR. The sensitivity and specificity of conventional ultrasound compared to the multislice CT angiography is estimated to be 33-63% and 63-93%, respectively. These values can be increased through the use of CEUS in up to 98-100% (sensitivity) and 82-93% (specificity). This article describes the etiology, classification and importance of different types of endoleaks. The value of CEUS in this clinical scenario will be discussed.
