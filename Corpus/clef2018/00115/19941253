Detection and characterization of endoleaks following endovascular treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms using contrast harmonic imaging (CHI) with quantitative perfusion analysis (TIC) compared to CT angiography (CTA). To show the feasibility of the detection of endoleaks following endovascular treatment of aortic aneurysms using contrast harmonic imaging (CHI) in comparison to computed tomography angiography (CTA).51 patients with suspected endoleaks, who underwent previous endovascular treatment for abdominal aortic aneurysm, were examined using CTA and vascular ultrasound. Biphasic CTA in all cases and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in 8 patients were evaluated by two radiologists in consensus and served as the standard of reference. Ultrasound was performed by an experienced examiner with a multi-frequency linear transducer (2 - 4 MHz) using CHI following bolus injection of 2.4 ml of SonoVue® IV (maximum 5 ml). All images were evaluated by two observers in consensus regarding the reperfusion of the abdominal aneurysm using time intensity curve (TIC) analysis.In 30 of 51 patients, endoleaks were detected concordantly in CHI and CTA. In 20 of 51 patients, no endoleak was found in CHI and CTA/DSA. In one patient, a type II endoleak could initially only be detected in CHI and was later confirmed in follow-up examinations by CTA (sens. 99%, spec. 93%, NPV 99 %, PPV 95%). TIC analysis allowed evaluation of the perfusion dynamics of endoleaks in all patients. Significant differences were found (p < 0.05, Mann Whitney U Test) regarding the perfusion within the aneurysm when an endoleak was present (10.39 ± 4.29 dB) or not present (6.42 ± 2.86 dB).CHI with perfusion analysis allows definite detection of endoleaks, especially if contraindications for CTA are present. CHI presents an alternative for follow-up monitoring.
