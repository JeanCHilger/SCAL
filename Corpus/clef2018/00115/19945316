Endovascular repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. To evaluate the early outcomes following thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair utilising fenestrated and branched endografts. DESIGN AND MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective analysis of all patients undergoing endovascular repair of TAAA in a single academic centre. All patients were deemed unfit for open surgical repair. Customised endografts were designed using CT data reconstructed on 3D workstations. Post-operatively all patients were evaluated radiologically at hospital discharge, at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months, and annually thereafter.Thirty-three consecutive patients (30 males) were treated over 33 months (August 2006 to April 2009). Median age and aneurysm size were 70 years (range 50-83 years) and 64 mm (range 55-100 mm) respectively. 114/116 (98%) of the targeted visceral vessels were successfully catheterised and perfused. The in-hospital mortality rate was 9% (3/33). Transient spinal cord ischaemia was diagnosed in 4/33 (12%) patients, and permanent paraplegia in one (3%). The median follow-up period was 11 months (range 1-33 months). Endoleaks were identified in 5/33 (15%) patients: type II in four patients and a type III endoleak in one patient which required the only secondary intervention. During follow-up, two patients died: one from stroke and the other from myocardial infarction 9 and 29 months respectively after the procedure.This preliminary study, which includes our learning curve, confirms the feasibility and safety of the endovascular repair of TAAA in high-risk patients. Meticulous follow-up to assess sac behaviour and visceral perfusion is critical in order to ensure optimal results of these complex endovascular repairs requiring numerous mating components.
