Peno-scrotal limphedema with giant hydrocele--surgical treatment particularities. The necessity for complex and multidisciplinary approach of "border" surgical pathology has unanimously been agreed upon for such a long period of time, its advantages becoming even more obvious in rare, particular cases.We report the case of a 39 year-old man diagnosed with lymphangiomatosis back in his childhood. He is admitted with a giant pseudotumoral scrotal mass presenting an important scrotal enlargement (40/35 cm). Physical examination, blood tests, ultrasound, IVP, abdominal and chest CT, psychiatric and plastic surgery evaluation established the diagnosis: peno-scrotal lymphedema with gigantic hydrocele and depressive disorder. Taking into account the important enlargement of the scrotum associated with the alteration of the local skin, we decided to form a mixed surgical team: urology--plastic and reconstructive surgery. We performed bilateral surgical therapy of hydrocele with partial excision and eversion of sac edges, excision of penoscrotal skin and subcutaneous tissue surplus. At the end we made a reconstruction by using a partial-thickness graft from the normal skin of the left thigh.Spinal anaesthesia was sufficient in order to perform a qualitative complex surgery. Intra and postoperative course was uneventful with minimal blood loss.Rare cases like this one clearly reveal the advantages of a multidisciplinary surgical team by combining usual surgical procedures from different specialities that could lead to spectacular results.
