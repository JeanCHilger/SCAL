Validity of an early postoperative baseline Doppler recording after aortic valve replacement. In 131 patients undergoing aortic valve replacement (53 bioprostheses, 78 mechanical), the pressure decrease across the prosthesis was recorded with Doppler ultrasound at a baseline study early postoperatively (mean 11 +/- 5 days) and compared with a repeat measurement 3 to 5 months later. At baseline the hemodynamic state was markedly different, with increased heart rate (89 +/- 14 vs. 74 +/- 13 beats/min, p less than 0.001) and decreased left ventricular ejection time index (367 +/- 21 vs 390 +/- 22, p less than 0.001). A minor and clinically insignificant decrease in pressure decrease with time was found. The 95% confidence interval for the difference was 0.2 to 3.0 and 0.2 to 1.7 mm Hg for the peak and the mean pressure decrease, respectively. The change in pressure decrease was statistically significant for bioprostheses (mean 16 +/- 5 vs 14 +/- 4 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) and smaller (less than or equal to 23 mm) valves (mean 17 +/- 4 vs 15 +/- 4 mm Hg, p less than 0.01), whereas no significant changes were found for mechanical valves or valves of a larger size. The change in mean pressure decrease from baseline to the second examination was within +/- 5 mm Hg for 82% of patients. It is concluded that despite a different hemodynamic state in the early postoperative period, the pressure decrease across aortic valve prostheses obtained at this time can be used as a reference for later comparison.
