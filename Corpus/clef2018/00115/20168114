Aortic intima media thickness in fetuses and children with intrauterine growth restriction. To measure aortic intima media thickness and diameter by ultrasonography in fetuses with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and in appropriate for gestational age (AGA) fetuses and in the same children after a mean follow-up of 18 months.This was a prospective study performed between January 2006 and August 2008. Fetuses were classified as having IUGR if the estimated fetal weight was below the 10th percentile and umbilical artery pulsatility index was greater than 2 standard deviations they were classified as AGA if the estimated fetal weight was between the 10th and 90th percentiles. Abdominal aortic intima media thickness and diameter were measured in each fetus with IUGR and in each AGA fetus at a mean gestational age of 32 weeks. The same measurements were taken in the children after a mean follow-up of 18 months.Thirty-eight fetuses with IUGR and 32 AGA fetuses were enrolled in the study. Aortic intima media thickness median values were significantly higher in IUGR than in AGA both in utero (1.9 mm compared with 1.15 mm P<.001) and after birth (2.4 mm compared with 1.03 mmAortic wall thickening in fetuses and children with IUGR shows differences with respect to those who were AGA. This may reflect a correlation between impaired growth in utero, Doppler abnormalities, low birth weight, and early signs of vascular dysfunction.II.
