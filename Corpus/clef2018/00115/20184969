Aortic endograft infection: A report of 2 cases. Endograft infection has received less attention than other complication, so that little is known about the general features, risk factors, and treatment. The purpose of this short series is to examine our experience of infective complications after EVAR.Between November 2000 and December 2008, 247 patients underwent endograft repair for abdominal aortic aneurysm. Follow-up protocol included clinical visit and computed-tomography angiography 1, 4 and 12 months after the intervention, and yearly thereafter. No duplex control was performed on a regular basis.Median follow-up was 16 months (range, 3-92) two patients (2/244, 0.8%) developed an endograft infection, 12 and 36-months after the intervention respectively. On admission, both patients complained septic-like fever and abdominal discomfortEndograft infection is an uncommon occurrence, Spiral computed-tomography seems to be an essential diagnostic tool. Graft removal was successful in our high-risk patients. A multicenter registry should be started to define guidelines.
