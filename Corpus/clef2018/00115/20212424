A ruptured right sinus of Valsalva diverticled aneurysm: echocardiographic diagnosis and surgical repair. Aneurysms of sinus of Valsava (SV) are uncommon heart lesions resulting from either a congenital deficiency or an acquired degeneration of the aortic wall. Usually these lesions are asymptomatic and incidentally diagnosed by echocardiography. Therefore when rupture occurs, they might require a prompt surgical operation. We report the case of a 58-year-old man who suddenly developed chest pain. On physical examination a new finding of sistodyastolic murmur was detected. On two-dimensional echocardiography was evidenced an aneurysm of the right SV ruptured in the right atrium. The patient was submitted to urgent surgery. Surgical aneurysm exclusion was achieved through a double access either transaortic and trans-right atrium approach. The right SV was obliterated by suturing a dacron patch on the aortic site while complete exclusion of the aneurysm expanding in the right atrium, was acquired through the right atrium itself, by 5/0 continous prolene suture line. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on 6th postoperative day. Transesophageal echocardiography represent the gold standard technique to assess this disease and to plan the adequate surgical treatment. The management of an asymptomatic, non ruptured aneurysm is not clear, however surgery is advisable when the aneurysm is complicated by rupture with an acceptably low operative risk and good long-term outcome.
