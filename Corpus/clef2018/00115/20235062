Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography versus computed tomographic angiography in the monitoring of patients after endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm -- preliminary experience. Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) is routinely used in the monitoring of patients after endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm. The aim of the study was to determine if contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) provides equivalent results to CTA in detection of endo-leaks in patients after abdominal aortic stentgraft placement.In a group of 7 patients (6 men and 1 woman aged 71+/-7 years) after repair procedure, 16 CTA and 16 CEUS follow-up examinations were performed. Second-generation contrast agent (Sonovue) and low-mechanical index technique were used for ultrasonography imaging.Computed tomographic angiography showed seven cases of type I, five cases of type II, and no endo-leaks in four examinations. In 15 out of 16 studies, the results of CEUS were consistent with the results of CTA. In one discrepant study, type II endo-leak was detected with CEUS while CTA was negative.Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography and CTA examinations in patients after endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm provide comparable results. CEUS may be considered an alternative technique to CTA.
