Obstructive uropathy following aortofemoral graft surgery. Fifty patients who had undergone aorto-bifemoral bypass with a bifurcated Dacron graft for aortoiliac arteriosclerotic obliteration were examined with real-time sectorial ultrasound to screen for the presence of hydronephrosis. Hydronephrosis was detected in only 1 case. The low incidence of this complication in our cases may be due to the fact that all our patients were explored at least 1 year after surgery. Some may have developed hydronephrosis early, but this may have resolved spontaneously during the first year after the operation, thus remaining undiagnosed. Pathogenic mechanisms suggested for the development of hydronephrosis and therapeutic approaches are discussed. We conclude that pre- and postoperative ultrasound examination and follow-up beyond 1 year postoperatively seem to be fully justified in all patients who undergo aortoiliac or aortofemoral reconstructive surgery.
