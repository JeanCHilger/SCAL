Early and late clinical outcomes of endovascular aneurysm repair in patients with an angulated neck. This study analyzed the clinical outcome in endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) patients with an angulated aortic neck. Two hundred thirty-eight EVAR patients underwent postoperative duplex ultrasonography and/or computed tomographic angiography, which was repeated every 6 to 12 months. Aortic neck angle was classified into < 45 degrees (A1, n= 129), > or = 45 to < 60 degrees (A2, n = 43), and > or = 60 degrees (A3, n = 42). The perioperative complication rates for groups A1, A2, and A3 were 13%, 5%, and 29%, respectively (p = .006). Proximal type I early endoleaks occurred in 9%, 33%, and 38% in groups A1, A2, and A3, respectively (p < .0001). Intraoperative proximal aortic cuffs were needed in 7%, 28%, and 33% in groups A1, A2, and A3, respectively (p < .0001). However, the rate of late reintervention was comparable in all groups. Postoperatively, the size of abdominal aortic aneurysm decreased or remained unchanged in 97%, 95%, and 84% in A1, A2, and A3, respectively (p = .0147). The rates of freedom from late type I endoleak at 1, 2, and 3 years were 90%, 85%, and 85% for A1 74%, 74%, and 68% for A2
