Flexible aortic valve prostheses: long-term functional results with porcine bioprostheses without mechanical commissure stent and aortic homografts. The long-term performance of two different types of flexible aortic prostheses was evaluated in 10 patients who received a stentless porcine prosthetic valve (group A) and in 18 patients who underwent aortic valve replacement with an aortic homograft (group B). In group A early postoperative angiography (5-16 days post surgery) revealed a mean gradient across the aortic prosthesis of 8 +/- 6 mmHg. Late postoperative Doppler echocardiography (3.2 +/- 0.9 years post surgery) suggested a mean gradient of 6 +/- 3 mmHg with a Doppler derived valve orifice area of 1.8 +/- 0.6 cm2. Color Doppler visualized mild prosthesis regurgitation in two of the 10 patients and two-dimensional imaging showed no significant leaflet calcification. In group B late postoperative Doppler echography (5.2 +/- 1.6 years post surgery) suggested a mean gradient of 11 +/- 14 mmHg with a mean graft orifice area of 1.8 +/- 0.5 cm2. Color Doppler revealed prosthesis regurgitation in 15 patients (severe 1, moderate 2, mild 12) and two-dimensional imaging visualized significant prosthesis leaflet calcification in two patients. The good hemodynamic function of a stentless porcine bioprosthesis which seems to be preserved for at least several years indicates that the use of the flexible aortic xenograft is worthwhile pursuing. The long-term performance of an aortic homograft is relatively poor and may be due to unsolved problems with regard to sterilizing and storing the valves.
