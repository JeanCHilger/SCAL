Improvement of aortic root replacement technique with aortic valve sparing: immediate and long-term results. One of the approaches to treatment of the aortic root aneurysms combined with aortic insufficiency is valve-sparing aortic root replacement. An analysis of immediate and long-term results dealt with 19 operations of replacement of the ascending parts of the aorta with sparing the aortic valve by the David I modified technique. The results demonstrated effectiveness and relative safety of this method of correction. At the long-term period 3 patients (16%) showed the II degree aortic regurgitation, in the other patients it was not higher than I degree. The improved David I technique is thought to be optimal in patients with the aortic root aneurysms, aortic insufficiency and unaltered aorta valve cusps.
