Pre-discharge duplex ultrasound scans detect endoleaks not seen on completion angiography after endovascular aneurysm repair. To determine whether a pre-discharge duplex ultrasound scan detects early endoleaks that would not otherwise have been identified.A retrospective review was conducted of all patients undergoing elective infrarenal endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) at our center. These patients underwent intraoperative completion angiography, had a duplex ultrasound scan prior to hospital discharge, and were followed at 1, 3, and 6 months and at 6-month intervals thereafter. The outcome of any patients found to have an endoleak on a pre-discharge scan was studied.There were 52 EVAR patients (50 men mean age 76 years, range 61-87) with endoleak on the pre-discharge duplex: 17 (2.8%) type I, 28 (4.6%) type II, and 8 (1.3%) type III. Of these, only 7 of the type I and 2 of the type II leaks had been detected on completion angiography. Among the patients with type I endoleaks, 5 had resolution of the leak, 10 required further endovascular interventions, and 2 had open repair (1 died of aneurysm rupture). Two patients with failed endovascular repairs of the leak also had open repair. Fifteen of the 28 type II endoleaks resolved, 4 were treated with endovascular procedures, 1 had open repair, 7 are being observed, and 1 was lost to follow-up. Six of the 8 type III leaks resolved, 1 required open repair for an enlarging sac, and 1 is being observed.Despite routine completion angiography, new endoleaks may be identified postoperatively, which suggests that more rigorous imaging at the point of completion angiography is required.
