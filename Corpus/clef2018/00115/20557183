Filters placed in the superficial femoral arteries for limb salvage in a high-surgical-risk patient with atheroembolism: results at 2 years. To report the off-label use of Emboshield filters as a treatment for bilateral atheroembolism (trash foot) in an inoperable patient.A 64-year-old man with a juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (jAAA) presented with necrotic wounds of the forefoot and toes of both feet. Doppler imaging showed triphasic signals. He was on oral anticoagulants because of a mechanical valve. The patient was admitted for evaluation and administration of intravenous antibiotics other than the jAAA, no other source of emboli was detected. Since the patient was inoperable, Emboshield filters were placed bilaterally through antegrade femoral accesses at the level of the superficial femoral arteries to prevent embolism to the feet. Two years later, the patient has no symptomsThis case demonstrates the successful off-label use of an Emboshield filter for trash foot in an inoperable patient.
