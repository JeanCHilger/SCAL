Comparison of time-resolved CT-angiography, contrast-enhanced ultrasound and digital subtraction angiography in a patient with a small type II endoleak after endovascular aneurysm repair. We report discordant imaging findings of a small persistent type II endoleak in a 72-year-old man who had undergone endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Although the aneurysm was growing in size digital subtraction angiography could not detect an endoleak, but time-resolved CT-angiography and contrast enhanced ultrasound did detect a small type II endoleak.
