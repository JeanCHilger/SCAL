Obstructive sleep apnea in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms: highly prevalent and associated with aneurysm expansion. Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are associated with life-threatening complications. The likelihood that an AAA will rupture is influenced by the aneurysm diameter and its expansion rate reasons for rapid expansion are largely unknown.To determine the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in patients with AAA, and investigate a possible association between OSA and rate of AAA expansion.A total of 127 patients (11 females), included in an AAA surveillance program, agreed to participate and underwent a sleep study. Annual AAA expansion was determined retrospectively from available ultrasound measurements. OSA was characterized using both oxygen desaturation index (ODI) and apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to assess the effect of OSA severity on AAA expansion.Mean age was 67.9 (SD, 6) years. Median interval between the first and last AAA measurements was 18 (range, 2-113) months. An ODI or AHI of greater than 10 was found in 40.5% and 41.5% of the patients, respectively. Patients with an ODI greater than 30 (n = 12) had a significantly faster median yearly AAA expansion rate (2.9 quartiles 2/5.7 mm/y) than patients with an ODI 0-5 (n = 47In patients with AAA, OSA is highly prevalent. Severe OSA may be a causal factor for faster AAA expansion, but this needs to be proved in a randomized controlled intervention trial.
