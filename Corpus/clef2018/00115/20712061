Living donor liver transplantation using dual grafts: ultrasonographic evaluation. To evaluate the dual-graft living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) with ultrasonography, with special emphasis on the postoperative complications.From January 2002 to August 2007, 110 adult-to-adult LDLTs were performed in West China Hospital of Sichuan University. Among them, dual-graft implantations were performed in six patients. Sonographic findings of the patients were retrospectively reviewed.All the six recipients survived the dual-graft adult-to-adult LDLT surgery. All had pleural effusion. Four patients had episodes of postoperative abdominal complications, including fluid collection between the grafts in three patients, intrahepatic biliary dilatation in two, hepatofugal portal flow of the left lobe in two, and atrophy of the left lobe in one.Although dual-graft LDLT takes more efforts and is technically complicated, it is safely feasible. Postoperative sonographic monitoring of the recipient is important.
