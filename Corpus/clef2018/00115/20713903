Vascular reactivity and flow characteristics of radial artery and long saphenous vein coronary bypass grafts: a 5-year follow-up. Radial artery (RA) aortocoronary bypass grafts anastomosed to a branch of the circumflex coronary artery have significantly better patency rates than saphenous vein (SV) grafts at 5 years, but the physiological characteristics and mechanisms involved are not clearly defined. We compared RA and SV graft vasomotor and flow responses to endothelium-dependent and -independent stimuli 5 years after surgery in a subgroup of patients enrolled in the Radial artery versus Saphenous Vein Patency (RSVP) trial.Twenty-seven patients were included in the study (RA, n=15 SV, n=12). Graft blood flow was calculated from flow velocity, measured by intracoronary Doppler, and luminal diameter, measured by quantitative coronary angiography, before and after intragraft infusions of adenosine, acetylcholine, and isosorbide dinitrate. At rest, RA luminal diameters were significantly smaller than SV luminal diameters (P=0.029), blood flow velocity was greater in RA than SV (P=0.008), and volume blood flows were similar. RA but not SV dilated in response to adenosine and isosorbide dinitrate (all P<0.05, RA versus SV, percent change from baseline), and there were no significant differences in the diameter responses to acetylcholine. Volume blood flow responses to adenosine, acetylcholine, and isosorbide dinitrate were comparable.Five years after surgery, RA coronary bypass conduits grafted to a single coronary territory demonstrated preserved flow-mediated vasodilatation, whereas SV grafts did not. Our results may provide insight into the more favorable patency of RA grafts over SV grafts.http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT00139399.
