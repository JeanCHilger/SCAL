Current technologies and changing the medical paradigm in aortic ruptures (analysis of clinical cases). The paper describes two clinical cases of aortic rupture of traumatic and nontraumatic genesis, which was difficult to diagnose due to evident neurological symptoms. The analysis of these cases and the data available in the literature leads to the conclusion that aortic rupture is not a nosological entity with a known fatal outcome. Timely diagnosis based on widely practiced up-to-date ultrasound and radiological methods allows one to perform surgical or endovascular treatment in good time, by showing good long-term outcomes.
