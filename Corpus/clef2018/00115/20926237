Endovascular treatment of elective abdominal aortic aneurysms: independent predictors of early and late mortality. The purpose of this study was to review our personal experience with patients who underwent elective endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms so as to detect the predictors of early and late mortality.Between November 2000 and June 2008, a total of 235 consecutive patients (218 men mean age: 71.9 ± 8.0 years, range: 48-95 years) underwent endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Comorbidities were defined by using the Society for Vascular score grading system and the preoperative risk grade on the basis of the classification of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA). Physical examination and spiral computed tomography were planned at 1, 4, and 12 months after the procedure, and on a yearly basis thereafter. Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography and plain X-rays were also performed.Primary technical success rate was 97% (228 of 235 cases). The overall hospital mortality was 2.1% (n = 5), ranging from 1.2% and 2.8% for patients with an ASA of score 2 and 3, respectively, to 7.7% for patients with an ASA score of 4. Multivariable analysis confirmed chronic renal failure (OR: 12.12, 95% CI: 1.83-80.17, p = 0.010) and transrenal endograft (OR: 9.61, 95% CI: 1.01-91.57, p = 0.049) as the only independent predictors of early mortality. Follow-up was completed for all 230 patients who were discharged, with a mean follow-up period of 26.3 ± 22.7 months (maximum: 92 months). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a reduced survival rate for older patients (p < 0.001) and patients with a larger aneurysm (p < 0.001). A reduced survival rate was also demonstrated for women and patients with higher ASA scores (p = 0.007, and p = 0.003, respectively). In multivariate Cox analysis, ASA score, age, diameter of the aneurysm, and being female independently affected long-term survival.On the basis of our experience, it was concluded that chronic renal failure and the endograft configuration were independent predictors of early mortality. Also, older patients, women, and patients with larger aneurysms and higher ASA scores had the poorest late survival rates.
