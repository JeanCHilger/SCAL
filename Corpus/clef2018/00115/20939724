T-stenting with small protrusion technique (TAP-stenting) for stenosed aortoiliac bifurcations with small abdominal aortas: an alternative to the classic kissing stents technique. To report the feasibility and midterm results of aortic bifurcation reconstruction in patients with small abdominal aortas using commercially available stents applied in a modified T-stenting technique adapted from coronary angioplasty.Twenty-three patients (16 men mean age 52.4 years) with lower limb ischemia (Fontaine stage IIb or III) and distal abdominal aortas <14 mm in diameter were treated for 39 common iliac artery and 16 aortic stenotic lesions involving the aortic bifurcation. A large, self-expanding stent was implanted from the lower aorta to one iliac branch, followed by deployment of a balloon-expandable stent in the contralateral iliac artery such that its proximal edge protruded a few millimeters through the struts of the self-expanding stent into the aorta [TAP (T And Protrude)-stenting technique]. Follow-up clinical, Doppler ultrasound, and computed tomography examinations were scheduled for each patient.Angiographic success was obtained in all 23 patients, who received 23 self-expanding aortomonoiliac stents (mean diameter 13.5 mm) and 22 balloon-expandable stents (mean diameter 8.14 mm) in the contralateral iliac branch. No complications were reported. At a mean 16.3-month follow-up (range 2-60), clinical and ankle-brachial index (0.6±0.2 at baseline versus 1.04±0.1, p<0.01) improvement was observed in all patients. All stents were patent (patency rate 100%). Two late technical failures of the contralateral stent were observed (incomplete dilation requiring angioplasty and incomplete protrusion without any hemodynamic impact).The TAP-stenting technique adapted to the aortoiliac bifurcation appears to be feasible, with satisfactory early and midterm patency rates in patients with small abdominal aortas. Larger series with longer follow-up times are necessary.
