Uric acid as a marker of oxidative stress in dilatation of the ascending aorta. Increased serum uric acid (UA) has been shown to directly promote oxidative stress. Recent studies point toward a role for oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of ascending aortic aneurysms (AscAAs). This study was designed to examine the relationship between serum UA concentrations, total antioxidant reductive capacity, and AscAAs.The serum UA concentrations, total antioxidant reductive capacity were compared in 60 patients with ascending aortic dilatation (ectasia group (3.8-4.3 cm), 34 patients aneurysmal group (≥4.4 cm), 26 patients) vs. 30 control subjects. The patients were evaluated by a complete transthoracic echocardiographic examination including measurement of the aortic dimensions.The serum UA concentration and total antioxidant reductive capacity were significantly higher in patients with AscAAs. In multiple linear regression analysis, hypertension and serum UA concentration were significantly associated with aortic dilatation (β = 0.3, P = 0.03 β = 0.15, P < 0.001, respectively).In conclusion, we found that serum UA concentration and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were significantly associated with aortic dilatation. The higher serum UA concentration may be responsible for the elevated serum antioxidant capacity that was observed among individuals with AscAA. Large-scale epidemiological studies conducted over several years are required to correlate the cross-sectional findings from this study with clinical outcome.
