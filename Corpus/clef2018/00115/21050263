Surgery for ruptured sinus of valsalva aneurysm into right ventricular outflow tract: role of intraoperative 2D and real time 3D transesophageal echocardiography. A major limitation of the 2D echocardiography during surgery for a complex cardiac lesion is its inability to provide an accurate spatial orientation of the structure. The real time 3D transesophageal echocardiography (RT-3D-TEE) technology available in Philips IE 33 ultrasound machine is relatively new to an operation suite. We evaluated its intraoperative utility in a patient, who was operated for repair of a ruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm (RSOVA) and closure of a supracristal ventricular septal defect. The VSD and RSOVA were visualized through different virtual windows in a more promising way on intraoperative RT-3D-TEE than on the 2D echocardiography. The acquired images could be virtually cropped and displayed in anatomical views to the operating surgeon for a clear orientation to the anatomy of the lesion. RT-3D-TEE is a potential intraoperative monitoring tool in surgeries for complex cardiac lesions.
