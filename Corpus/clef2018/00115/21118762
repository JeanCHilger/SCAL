Numerical analysis of effects of measurement errors on ultrasonic-measurement-integrated simulation. Ultrasonic-measurement-integrated (UMI) simulation, in which feedback signals are applied to the governing equations based on errors between ultrasonic measurement and numerical simulation, has been investigated for reproduction of the blood flow field. However, ultrasonic measurement data inherently include some errors. In this study, the effects of four major measurement errors, namely, errors due to gaussian noise, aliasing, wall filter, and lack of data, on UMI simulation were examined by a numerical experiment dealing with the blood flow field in the descending aorta with an aneurysm, the same as in our previous study. While solving the governing equations in UMI simulation, gaussian noise did not prevent the UMI simulation from effectively reproducing the blood flow field. In contrast, aliasing caused significant errors in UMI simulation. Effects of wall filter and lack of data appeared in diastole and in the whole period, respectively. By detecting significantly large feedback signals as a sign of aliasing and by not adding feedback signals where measured Doppler velocities were aliasing or zero, the computational accuracy substantially improved, alleviating the effects of measurement errors. Through these considerations, UMI simulation can provide accurate and detailed information on hemodynamics with suppression of four major measurement errors.
