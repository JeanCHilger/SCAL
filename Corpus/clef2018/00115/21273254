Aortic valve reconstruction using self-developed aortic valve plasty system in aortic valve disease. Aortic valve disease is usually treated by prosthetic valve replacement. We have performed aortic valve plasty (AVP) using glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardium. AVP was performed for 88 patients from April 2007 through August 2009. Sixty-five patients had aortic stenosis, and 23 patients had aortic regurgitation (AR). Twenty-one patients showed bicuspid aortic valves, and one patient showed quadricuspid valve. There were 43 males and 45 females. Their mean age was 70.6±10.5 years old. First, diseased leaflets excised. Then, the distance between each commissure was measured. The new leaflet were trimmed with an original template from a glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardium sample. Finally, the annular margin of the pericardial leaflet was running sutured to each annulus. There was no operative mortality or embolic event. Postoperative echocardiography revealed a mean peak pressure gradient (PG) of 19.0±9.1 mmHg one week after surgery. Thirty-two patients had echocardiography one year after surgery. The peak PG became 12.9±5.8 mmHg. Ten patients showed no AR, 20 patients showed trivial AR, and two patients showed mild AR. Freedom from reoperation is 100% at three years follow-up.
