Clinical usefulness of transesophageal Doppler echocardiography. The usefulness of transesophageal Doppler echocardiography (TEE) was assessed in patients with various cardiovascular diseases including 15 patients with dissecting aortic aneurysm (DAA), two with thoracic aneurysm, 16 with ischemic heart disease and 14 with acquired valvular diseases. In dissecting aortic aneurysms, TEE provided clear images of the intimal flaps even in the aortic arch and descending aorta in which clear images could not be obtained by conventional external Doppler echocardiography. The entry site was detected in 11 of the 15 (73%) cases using TEE, but in only three of the 15 cases using conventional Doppler technique. In two cases of true aortic aneurysms, TEE provided clear images of the aneurysm in the descending thoracic aorta, which was discriminated precisely from DAA. In valvular disease, all four valves (aortic, pulmonary and atrio-ventricular valves) were easily observed without disturbance by any other tissues using a transesophageal approach. In addition, valve aneurysms in the posterior mitral leaflets were detected using TEE in two cases. In two cases of mitral stenosis, a thrombus was observed in the left atrial appendage. These findings were confirmed during surgery, but could not be obtained by the conventional external studies. In 16 cases, TEE was performed during aorto-coronary bypass surgery under general anesthesia. In two of these cases, left ventricular assist devices were applied after surgery. In these cases, where conventional Doppler echocardiography was not applicable, cardiac function could be monitored by TEE. Thus, TEE is useful not only in evaluating morphological function in the cardiovascular system but also in monitoring cardiac hemodynamics during and after heart surgery.
