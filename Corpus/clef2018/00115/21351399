Prevention of type II endoleak using postoperative coiling of the abdominal aortic aneurysm sac during stent graft implantation. A prospective randomized study assessing the success rates of type II endoleak (EL) prevention, using postoperative coiling of the abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) sac during stent graft (SG) implantation.From January 2008 to July 2009, 86 patients were operated for AAA using endovascular methods with bifurcation SG. The subjects were prospectively randomized into two subgroups. Group A subjects (42 subjects 48.8%) had various numbers of coils introduced into the sac, close to the SG body. Group B (44 subjectsPrior to the procedure, there were only minor differences in the number of source type II EL arteries (AL 3.8 vs. 3.5 AMI 0.78 vs. 0.55Peroperative introduction of coils into the AAA sac is one of the options for type II EL prevention. It facilitates successful regression and disappearance of type II EL.
