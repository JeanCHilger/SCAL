Validation of the smallest pocket echoscopic device's diagnostic capabilities in heart investigation. We hypothesized that, based on greyscale imaging and color Doppler capabilities, a new pocket ultrasound device (PUD) could accurately record cardiologic diagnostic findings. One hundred patients referred for conventional clinical indications underwent a standard echocardiography. Subsequently, a second physician blinded to the results performed an evaluation using the PUD on the same patients. Study end-points were echocardiographic window quality left ventricular (LV) morphology
