Schistosoma mansoni infection in the liver graft: The impact on donor and recipient outcomes after transplantation. The increasing number of transplants performed each year has led to the identification of unusual diseases in liver grafts from asymptomatic donors that were unrecognized before liver transplantation. Here we report our experience with patients who received liver grafts infected with schistosomiasis. From September 1991 to August 2010, 482 pediatric liver transplants were performed at A. C. Camargo Hospital/Sírio-Libanês Hospital (São Paulo, Brazil). For the identification of Schistosoma mansoni infections, pathology slides for the recipients were reviewed these included postreperfusion and follow-up liver biopsy samples. We were able to identify 6 cases of schistosomiasis transmitted through infected grafts (5 of these grafts were from living donors). All living donors were confirmed to have normal liver chemistries, negative fecal tests for parasitic diseases, and normal abdominal ultrasound findings. Liver biopsy was not performed before transplantation. In all cases, features of schistosomiasis were absent in the liver explants. The living donors were treated with praziquantel and were taught to avoid risk factors for reinfection. No specific treatment for schistosomiasis was given to the recipients. There were no perioperative deaths, but 2 recipients died after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) because of Kaposi's sarcoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In conclusion, using liver grafts infected with S. mansoni eggs did not compromise the results of LDLT in this pediatric cohort. Because of the parasite's life cycle and the therapeutic target of praziquantel, only donors should be treated for the infection. Three years of follow-up showed an uneventful recovery for the living donors.
