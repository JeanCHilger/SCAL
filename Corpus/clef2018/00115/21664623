Lack of neurologic improvement after aortic repair for acute type A aortic dissection complicated by cerebral malperfusion: predictors and association with survival. Surgical treatment of acute type A aortic dissection complicated by cerebral malperfusion remains challenging. This study evaluated predictors of lack of neurologic improvement after aortic repair for acute type A dissection complicated by cerebral malperfusion and assessed relationship with survival.We retrospectively reviewed 41 consecutive patients operated on between 1999 and 2008 for acute type A dissection complicated by cerebral malperfusion. Lack of postoperative neurologic improvement was defined as a difference between baseline and postoperative National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores of 3 points or less.Lack of neurologic improvement was seen in 15 patients (37%). Logistic regression analysis, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (odds ratio, 6.7 95% confidence interval, 1.4-32.4Time to surgery and baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score were predictors of lack of improvement, which was associated with poor survival.
