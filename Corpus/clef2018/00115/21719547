Echocardiography in the intensive care unit. As ultrasound technology improves and ultrasound availability increases, echocardiography utilization is growing within intensive care units. Although not replacing the often-needed comprehensive echocardiographic evaluation, limited bedside echocardiography promises to provide intensivists with enhanced diagnostic ability and improved hemodynamic understanding of individual patients. Routine and emergency echocardiography within the intensive care unit focuses on identifying and optimizing medically treatable conditions in a timely manner. Methods for such goal-directed assessments are presented.
