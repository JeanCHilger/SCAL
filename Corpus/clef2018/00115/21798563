Increased risk of dehiscence after tricuspid valve repair with rigid annuloplasty rings. Surgical management of tricuspid valve regurgitation mainly consists of tricuspid valve annuloplasty, usually performed with implantation of a rigid ring or a flexible band.We performed a retrospective analysis on 820 patients who underwent tricuspid valve repair between March 2002 and July 2009 with either a flexible Cosgrove-Edwards band (n = 415 Edwards Lifesciences LLC, Irvine, Calif) or a rigid Carpentier-Edwards Classic annuloplasty ring (n = 405Thirty-day mortality was 10.1% (Cosgrove-Edwards, 11.9% Carpentier-Edwards, 8.4%), and 5-year survival was 62.4% (Carpentier-Edwards, 64.7%Although both rigid and flexible systems provide acceptable early tricuspid valve repair results, use of a rigid ring increases risk of subsequent ring dehiscence.
