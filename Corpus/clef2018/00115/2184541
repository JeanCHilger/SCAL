Ultrasonic diagnosis of the upper abdomen performed in general practice. This paper considers the use of ultrasound diagnostics performed by a general practitioner on patients with pain in the upper abdominal region, with particular attention to the liver, gallbladder and aorta. 189 patients were examined, of whom 48 were found to have one or more diseases. 55 specific diagnoses were made. 23 patients had gallstones, and five had aortic aneurysm. Malignant diseases were suspected in five patients. The negative results were evaluated by means of a questionnaire after completion of the period of registration. This questionnaire did not expose any undiagnosed disease in the examined organs. We conclude that ultrasound diagnostics may be performed on this group of patients by interested general practitioners with special training.
