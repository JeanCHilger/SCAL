Reproducibility of ultrasound measurement of the abdominal aorta. Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening and surveillance programmes use ultrasound imaging to measure the anteroposterior (AP) diameter of the infrarenal aorta. The aim of this study was to examine potential observer bias and variability in ultrasound measurements.Studies were identified for review via a MEDLINE database search (1966-2009). References supplied in accessed papers were also checked for potential relevance. Consistent search terminology, and inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to ensure quality of data. Nine papers were available to review.Variation in intraobserver repeatability and interobserver reproducibility was identified. Six studies reported intraobserver repeatability coefficients for AP aortic diameter measurements of 1·6-4·4 mm. These were below the 5-mm level regarded as acceptable by the UK and USA AAA screening programmes. Five studies had interobserver reproducibility below the level of 5 mm. Four studies, however, reported poor reproducibility (range from -2 to +5·2 to -10·5 to +10·4) these differences may have had a significant clinical impact on screening and surveillance.The studies used different methodologies with no standardized measurement techniques. Measurements were taken by observers from different medical disciplines of varying grade and levels of training. Standard training and formal quality assurance of ultrasound measurements are important components of an effective AAA screening programme.
