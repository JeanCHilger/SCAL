Surveillance of a coiled renal artery aneurysm by contrast-enhanced ultrasound with Definity. Imaging surveillance is necessary to assess for long-term procedural outcomes after endovascular treatment. This is generally performed by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has recognized utility for cardiovascular and abdominal applications and is an alternative option in patients with renal impairment or CT/MR contrast-related reactions. We believe that we present the first reported case of CEUS in the surveillance of a treated renal artery aneurysm. The 57-year-old patient had a severe CT contrast allergy. CEUS performed with Definity microbubble ultrasound contrast (Lantheus Medical Imaging, Billerica, Mass) was well tolerated and showed no residual filling of the aneurysm.
