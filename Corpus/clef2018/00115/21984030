Endovascular management of symptomatic cerebral malperfusion due to carotid dissection after type A aortic dissection repair. Type A acute aortic dissection is a surgical emergency, and supra-aortic trunk involvement may be complicated by stroke in 6% to 20% of cases. A 66-year-old Caucasian female patient underwent a composite repair of the ascending aorta for type A aortic dissection. Postoperative period was complicated by episodes of "drop attack." Doppler ultrasound of supra-aortic trunks revealed an intimal flap occluding right internal carotid artery.Multiple stenting was performed from carotid bifurcation to internal carotid artery in order to exclude the dissection intimal flap. After endovascular procedure physiatrist considered that motor functional improvement was better than expected, and we support that endovascular resolution of carotid malperfusion led to a better outcome.According to other experience, endovascular procedure resulted as a safe and effective way. Moreover, ultrasound monitoring of supra-aortic trunks in postoperative period is recommended.
