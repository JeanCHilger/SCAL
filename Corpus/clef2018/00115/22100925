Aortic valve replacement with smaller valve size. The occurrence of prosthesis-patient mismatch after aortic valve replacement with a small valve size was evaluated in 249 patients, focusing on echocardiographic data. Aortic valve pathology included regurgitation in 174 patients and stenosis in 75. Echocardiography was performed in the early and late postoperative periods. A projected effective orifice area index < 0.85 cm(2)·m(-2) was noted in 56 patients values ≥ 0.85 cm(2)·m(-2) were found in 128. Postoperative changes in ejection fraction, left ventricular mass regression, and peak transprosthetic gradient were similar in both groups. Small prostheses (≤ 19 mm) were used in 43 patients who had significantly higher postoperative transprosthetic gradients in both the early and late periods, compared to those with larger prostheses. Our findings show that the occurrence of prosthesis-patient mismatch after aortic valve replacement is rare. Left ventricular mass regression occurred in most patients, with acceptable transprosthetic gradients.
