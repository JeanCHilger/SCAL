Avoidance of aortic side-clamping for proximal bypass anastomoses: better short-term outcome? The benefit of off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) surgery may be reduced by strokes caused by microemboli produced after aortic side-clamping for proximal bypass anastomoses. The Heartstring device allows constructing proximal bypass anastomoses without side-clamping of the aorta.This retrospective study describes 260 consecutive patients who underwent OPCAB surgery 442 proximal anastomoses were performed with the Heartstring device in this series. Ten percent of the patients were randomly sampled before discharge to undergo a coronary angiogram for assessment of graft patency.Intraoperative Doppler measurements confirmed regular bypass function. Early mortality occurred in 4 patients (1.5%), and stroke occurred in 2 patients (0.8%). Device-related bleeding was negligible, and there were no cases of aortic dissection. Perioperative ischemia occurred in 8 patients (3.1%). Predischarge coronary angiography evaluations in 25 of the patients (of 260) showed that all 42 Heartstring-assisted anastomoses (of 442) were patent.Clampless performance of proximal bypass anastomoses combined with OPCAB is associated with a very low incidence of stroke complications. Short-term follow-up has shown excellent results regarding bypass patency and other adverse events. Prospective randomized trials are required to confirm the advantage of this technique.
