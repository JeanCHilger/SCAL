Transcatheter aortic valve-in-valve-in-valve implantation for a failed xenograft. A 78-year-old gentleman with a diagnosis of symptomatic severe xenograft aortic stenosis with multiple comorbidities was referred for transcatheter aortic valve implantation, that is, a "valve-in-valve" procedure. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation was performed by transapical approach using a balloon-expandable bioprosthesis. During valve deployment, the prosthesis moved toward the left ventricle and a second balloon-expandable valve was implanted within the first one-a "valve-in-valve-in-valve" to avoid further ventricular embolization of the first bioprosthesis. Echocardiography at hospital discharge showed a residual mean transvalvular gradient of 17 mm Hg and trivial paravalvular aortic regurgitation. At 1 year follow-up, the patient was in New York Heart Association functional class II.
