Discovery of a novel circulating biomarker in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm: a pilot study using a proteomic approach. Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common condition with high mortality when ruptured. Most clinicians agree that small AAAs are best managed by ultrasonographic surveillance. However, it has been stated in recent reviews that a serum/plasma biomarker that predicts AAA rupture risk would be a powerful tool in stratifying patients with small AAA. Identification of such circulating biomarkers has been to date unsuccessful. In this study, we used a proteomic approach to find new, potential plasma AAA biomarker candidates. Prefractionated plasma samples were analyzed by two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis to identify differentially expressed proteins between four patients with small AAA and four controls without aneurysm. Protein spots that differed significantly between patients and controls were selected and identified by mass spectrometry. Three protein spots had significantly different expression between patients and controls. The most interesting finding was that patients with small AAA had increased levels of the enzyme glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase D (GPI-PLD) compared with the controls without aneurysm. In conclusion, by using a proteomic approach, this pilot-study provides evidence of GPI-PLD as a novel potential plasma biomarker for AAA.
