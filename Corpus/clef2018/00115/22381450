Extended single-patch repair of supravalvar aortic stenosis: a simple and effective technique. The optimal surgical procedure for repair of supravalvar aortic stenosis (SVAS) remains uncertain. Proponents of multisinus repair techniques suggest improved outcomes compared with the single-patch technique. We evaluated the outcomes after an extended single-patch technique for relief of SVAS.A cross-sectional retrospective analysis was performed of all SVAS patients who underwent repair from 1996 to 2009. Patient, procedural, and hospital course data were obtained through a review of the medical records. At follow-up, patients were evaluated for residual SVAS gradient, valvar aortic stenosis, aortic insufficiency, and need for reintervention.Twenty-two patients (mean age, 2.4 ± 2.4 years) underwent repair of SVAS (discrete form, 59%). Mean preoperative peak gradient was 77 ± 27 mm Hg (range, 20 to 139 mm Hg). There were no hospital deaths. Median postoperative length of stay was 5 days (range, 3 to 68 days). Mean follow-up was 4.1 ± 3.5 years (range, 0.7 to 13 years). Follow-up Doppler echocardiography revealed a peak left ventricular outflow tract gradient of 10 ± 12 mm Hg (range, 0 to 41 mm Hg). No patient had significant valvar aortic stenosis or insufficiency. Two patients (9%) required catheter-based reintervention that was unrelated to the SVAS repair.This study demonstrates that a simple, extended single-patch technique for repair of SVAS provides excellent medium-term results. A durable reduction in gradient with low complication and recurrence rates can be achieved without the need for more complicated multisinus patch repairs.
