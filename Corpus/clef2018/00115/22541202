Pressure necrosis of the outlet septum caused by two adjacent implants. A patient had a history of a Ross-Konno procedure, stenting of the pulmonary homograft, and an aortic valve replacement. Pressure necrosis developed in the tissues in between the stent and the prosthetic valve. This resulted in a defect between the right and left ventricular outflow tracts that required a complex operation for its correction.
