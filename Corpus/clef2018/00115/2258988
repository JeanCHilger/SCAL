Ultrafast computed tomography in the diagnosis of aortic aneurysms and dissections. UFCT, by virtue of its 50 to 400 millisecond acquisition times, 0.75 to 1.5 mm resolution, and excellent vascular opacification, provides a rapid, minimally invasive method for assessing aortic aneurysms and dissections. During a 3.5-year period, 50 patients with suspected thoracic, thoracoabdominal, and abdominal aortic aneurysms or dissections were evaluated using the Imatron C-100 UFCT scanner. Eighteen patients had thoracic or thoracoabdominal aneurysms. 17 had thoracic or thoracoabdominal dissections, 7 had abdominal aneurysms, and in 8 no aneurysms or dissections were found. In 23 of the 35 patients with thoracic or thoracoabdominal aneurysms or dissections, the UFCT findings accurately reflected the findings at aortography, surgery, or autopsy. There was one false-positive examination. The remaining 11 patients with UFCT findings of aneurysm or dissection were followed clinically. In the 7 patients with abdominal aneurysms, 4 were confirmed by angiography or surgery, and 3 were followed clinically. Of the 8 patients with negative UFCT examinations, 2 had subsequent angiography that failed to show an aneurysm, and 6 were followed from 6 to 30 months without developing findings suggestive of aneurysm. UFCT appears to be a useful, minimally invasive technique for detecting and following aortic aneurysms and dissections.
