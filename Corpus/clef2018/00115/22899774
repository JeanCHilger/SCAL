Cerebral embolization during transcatheter aortic valve implantation: a transcranial Doppler study. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is associated with a higher risk of neurological events for both the transfemoral and transapical approach than surgical valve replacement. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging has revealed more new, albeit clinically silent lesions from procedural embolization, yet the main source and predominant procedural step of emboli remain unclear.Eighty-three patients underwent transfemoral (Medtronic CoreValve [MCV(TF)], n=32 Edwards Sapien [ES(TF)], n=26) and transapical (ES(TA): n=25) TAVI. Serial transcranial Doppler examinations before, during, and 3 months after TAVI were used to identify high-intensity transient signals (HITS) as a surrogate for microembolization. Procedural HITS were detected in all patients, predominantly during manipulation of the calcified aortic valve while stent valves were being positioned and implanted. The balloon-expandable ES prosthesis caused significantly more HITS (mean [95% CI]) during positioning (ES(TF), 259.9 [184.8-334.9]Procedural HITS were detected by transcranial Doppler in all patients. Although no difference was observed between the transfemoral and the transapical approach with the balloon-expandable ES stent valve, transfemoral TAVI with the self-expandable MCV prosthesis resulted in the greatest number of HITS, predominantly during implantation.
