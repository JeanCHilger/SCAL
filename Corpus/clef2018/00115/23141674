An in vitro phantom study on the influence of tear size and configuration on the hemodynamics of the lumina in chronic type B aortic dissections. Management and follow-up of chronic aortic dissections continue to be a clinical challenge due to progressive dilatation and subsequent rupture. To predict complications, guidelines suggest follow-up of aortic diameter. However, dilatation is triggered by hemodynamic parameters (pressures/wall shear stresses) and geometry of false (FL) and true lumen (TL), information not captured by diameter alone. Therefore, we aimed at better understanding the influence of dissection anatomy on TL and FL hemodynamics.In vitro studies were performed using pulsatile flow in realistic dissected latex/silicone geometries with varying tear number, size, and location. We assessed three different conformations: (1) proximal tear only (2) distal tear onlyThe presence of large tears equalized FL/TL pressures compared with models with only small tears (proximal FPI(mean)% 99.85 ± 0.45 vs 92.73 ± 3.63 distal FPI(mean)% 99.51 ± 0.80 vs 96.35 ± 1.96Our results suggest that FL hemodynamics heavily depends on cumulative tear size, and thus, it is an important parameter to take into account when clinically assessing chronic aortic dissections.
