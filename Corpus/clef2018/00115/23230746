Appling the color Doppler in abdominal aortic balloon occlusion for pelvic and sacral surgery. To apply the color Doppler in abdominal aortic balloon occlusion for pelvic or sacral surgery, and to evaluate its effectiveness in controlling blood loss.A Philips 4500 color Doppler was used to place abdominal aortic balloons in 20 patients with pelvic or sacral tumors who underwent surgery. The temporary abdominal aortic balloons were used for controlling blood loss in the surgery. Transesophageal echocardiography was performed to detect the renal blood flow.Abdominal aortic balloons were successfully placed to the 20 patients, with a water injection rate of 10-18 (13.8 +/- 2.6) mL and a total of 45-180 min occlusion during the 70-450 (265 +/- 102) min surgery. The intraoperative blood loss ranged from 250 to 4000 (1357 +/- 997) mL. The water injection rate of abdominal aortic-balloons (Y) was correlated with the diameter of abdominal aorta (X): Y = 7.1602X + 2. 9968 (R2 = 0.7371, P < 0.05). Renal blood flow was not affected. The patients stayed in hospital for 7-13 (9.8 +/- 11.9) days after operation. One patient developed complications. The one year recurrence rate of tumors was 10%.The color Doppler provides a simple and accurate instrument for abdominal aortic-balloon occlusion, with reliable blood loss control.
