A Doppler echocardiographic study of normal and dysfunctioning Carpentier-Edwards bioprostheses. The aim of this study was to delineate the Doppler echocardiographic characteristics of normal and dysfunctioning Carpentier-Edwards bioprostheses. Echocardiographic and Doppler studies were performed on 61 mitral and 41 aortic valves by means of on clinical evaluation, 15 mitral and 12 aortic valves were considered to be abnormally functioning. The maximum velocity (Vmax) of diastolic left ventricular inflow, pressure half-time and valve orifice area were assessed for prostheses in mitral position, while the maximum velocity (Vmax) of transaortic flow was calculated for prostheses in aortic position. Moreover, the quantitative assessment of mitral and/or aortic regurgitation was performed using the mapping technique with pulsed Doppler wave mode. Normally functioning mitral prostheses were characterized by Vmax less than 2.20 m/s and pressure half-time less than 164 ms
