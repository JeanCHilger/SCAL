A transesophageal echocardiography technique to locate the kidney and monitor renal perfusion. Monitoring the renal arterial Doppler flow velocity indices, the resistive index and pulsatility index, with ultrasound may help predict renal dysfunction. However, such monitoring has been done intermittently by transcutaneous ultrasound in the postoperative intensive care setting. In the operating room, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is an alternative to transcutaneous ultrasound for obtaining indices of renal perfusion. However, it is difficult to locate the right kidney using TEE. We propose a new technique to locate the left kidney that, in our experience, is simple and easy to perform. We believe, starting from a transgastric left ventricular short-axis view, turning left to locate the abdominal aorta, and following it to the origin of the left renal artery may help locate the left kidney faster than previously described techniques. We also propose a new technique to monitor these Doppler indices using TEE during the intraoperative period.
