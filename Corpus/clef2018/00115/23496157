Imaging diagnosis-aortic aneurysm and ureteral obstruction secondary to umbilical artery abscessation in a 5-week-old foal. A 5-week-old foal was evaluated for fever and hematuria of 3 days duration. Cystoscopy localized the blood to be originating from the left ureter. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed left hydronephrosis, hydroureter, and omphaloarteritis of the left umbilical artery with abscess formation that communicated with an arterial structure. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a large aortic aneurysm within the center of the abscess. An exploratory celiotomy was performed and the infection was nonresectable. The prognosis for life was grave therefore the colt was euthanized. Necropsy findings confirmed the antemortem diagnosis. Ultrasound and CT imaging in this case provided an accurate antemortem diagnosis.
