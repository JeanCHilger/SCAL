The importance of socioeconomic factors for compliance and outcome at screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm in 65-year-old men. To evaluate compliance with screening and prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in relation to background data regarding area-based socioeconomic status.Our department annually invites 4300 65-year-old men from the city of Malmö and 15 neighboring municipalities to ultrasound AAA screening. In a cross-sectional cohort study, compliance and AAA prevalence among 8269 men were related to background socioeconomic data such as mean income, proportion of immigrants, percentage of subjects on welfare, smoking habits, and unemployment rate in the different municipalities. The 10 different administrative areas in Malmö were evaluated separately.Compliance with screening in the entire area was 6630/8269 (80.2%) but varied between 64.4% and 89.3% in different municipalities (P < .001). In univariate analysis, compliance increased with increasing mean income (r = 0.873 P < .001) but decreased with increasing proportion of immigrants (r = -0.685Compliance with ultrasound screening for AAA differed between different geographical areas. In areas with low socioeconomic status, compliance rates were lower, whereas AAA prevalence was higher. The identification of contextual factors associated with low compliance is important to be able to allow targeted actions to increase efficacy of ultrasound screening for AAA. Targeted actions to increase compliance in those areas are being scientifically investigated and implemented.
