Contained rupture of a celiac artery aneurysm treated with aortic endograft deployment and assisting percutaneous coil and thrombin infusion. In this report we present a case of a ruptured celiac artery aneurysm (CAA) with a thrombosed distal neck, which was treated as an emergently with a deployment of a tube thoracic endograft to the descending thoracic and upper abdominal aorta. The initial treatment was assisted with a second stage percutaneous, transhepatic, ultrasound guided needle infusion of coil and thrombin to the aneurysmal sac due to type Ib endoleak, with immediate thrombosis of the aneurysm. This technique, although not standard,could also be considered as a useful choice for the treatment of CAAs with wide proximal and patent distal neck.
