Coronary artery disease and risk of major vascular events after cerebral infarction. The impact of asymptomatic coronary artery disease on the risk of major vascular events in patients with cerebral infarction is unknown.Four hundred five patients with acute cerebral infarction underwent carotid, femoral artery, thoracic, and abdominal aorta ultrasound examination. Of 342 patients with no known coronary heart disease, 315 underwent coronary angiography. We evaluated the 2-year risk of major vascular events (myocardial infarction, resuscitation after cardiac arrest, hospitalization for unstable angina or heart failure, stroke, or major peripheral arterial disease events) in patients with known coronary heart disease (n=63), and in the no known coronary heart disease group (n=315) as a function of coronary angiographic status (n=315).At 2 years, the estimated risk of major vascular events was 11.0% (95% confidence interval, 8.2-14.7). According to baseline coronary angiography, estimated risk was 3.4% in patients with no coronary artery disease (n=120), 8.0% with asymptomatic coronary artery stenosis <50% (n=113), 16.2% with asymptomatic coronary artery stenosis ≥ 50% (n=81), and 24.1% with known coronary heart disease (P<0.0001). Using no coronary artery disease as the reference, the age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) of vascular events was 2.10 (0.63-6.96) for asymptomatic coronary stenosis <50%, 4.36 (1.35-14.12) for asymptomatic coronary stenosis ≥ 50%, and 6.86 (2.15-21.31) for known coronary artery disease.In patients with nonfatal cerebral infarction, presence and extent of asymptomatic stenoses on coronary angiography are strong predictors of major vascular events within 2 years.
