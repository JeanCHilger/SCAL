Accuracy of Doppler-echocardiographic parameters for the detection of aortic bileaflet mechanical prosthetic valve dysfunction. In vitro and in vivo studies were performed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the different Doppler-echocardiographic parameters proposed in the American Society of Echocardiography guidelines to identify dysfunction of bileaflet mechanical valves (BMV) in the aortic position.Two models of BMV (St Jude HP, MCRI On-X) of different sizes (2123The Doppler-echocardiographic parameters and criteria proposed in the guidelines lack sensitivity for the detection of BMV dysfunction. The utilization of a DVI < 0.35 or an EOA-D > 1 SD improved the sensitivity (>90%) for the detection of moderate-to-severe dysfunction, but the sensitivity remained suboptimal (<65%) for detection of mild dysfunction.
