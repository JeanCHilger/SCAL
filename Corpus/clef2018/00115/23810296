Outcomes of a novel technique of endovascular repair of aneurysmal internal iliac arteries using iliac branch devices. To present midterm outcomes of a novel technique of endovascular repair of aneurysmal internal iliac arteries (AIIAs) using iliac branch devices (IBDs).Between January 2005 and August 2012, 129 patients with aneurysms involving the iliac bifurcation underwent placement of IBDs. In particular, between April 2010 and August 2012, 16 consecutive patients with aortoiliac or solitary iliac aneurysms and coexisting AIIAs were treated with the novel suggested strategy. The follow-up included physical examination and computed tomography (CT) angiography postoperatively, duplex scan at 3 months, CT scan at 6 months, and then CT scan annually.The technical success rate was 100%. The primary patency rate for the overall 21 internal iliac branches (five patients with bilateral aneurysms) was 95.3%. The overall assisted patency was 100%. No patient had evidence of type I/III endoleak during the follow-up of 2 years. Two patients showed type II endoleaks originating from the abdominal aneurysm sac and are under radiological surveillance.Our 2-year experience with the described novel approach showed its safety and feasibility, expanding the applicability of IBDs also in case of coexisting AIIAs. Long-term results and an increased number of treated patients with this technique are needed.
