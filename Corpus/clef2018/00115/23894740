Induction of thrombosis of the abdominal aneurysm sac through the application of radiofrequency. An experimental study. This is an experimental study of endovascular aortic surgery for evaluation of the effect of thrombosis induced in the aneurysmal sac using a radiofrequency method.To determine the efficacy of the induction of thrombosis of the abdominal aneurysm sac as a prevention of endoleaks after endovascular treatment.Six dogs underwent radiofrequency blood clotting of the aneurysm sac and where afterwards treated with stent-grafting. A comparison with a historical group of 4 dogs with an abdominal aneurysm treated with stent-grafting was used. Radiofrequency was applied to each sac for 1 minute at 127 mA ± 33 (mean ± SD) (tip temperature, 92°C ± 2). IVUS ultrasonography and histology studies were used for the evaluation of the method.The results show the efficacy of the radiofrequency method and its possible future inclusion as a standard clinical application.Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms is dependent on the complete exclusion of the aneurysm from the arterial circulation. Later growth of the aneurysm is originated from retrograde flow into the sac. This study demonstrates how the use of radiofrequency induced thrombosis in a canine model of aneurysm sac. Ultrasound IVUS enabled further control for assessment of blood coagulation after radiofrequency treatment. This approach may be considered a tool for future prevention of endoleaks, in clinical practice.
