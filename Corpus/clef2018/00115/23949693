A case of percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty for partial coverage of a renal artery by a stent graft after endovascular aneurysm repair. An elderly woman was admitted to our hospital for evaluation of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and we decided to treat her AAA with endovascular aneurysm repair. Her renal function became worse after the operation and a renogram suggested flow disturbance of her right renal artery. We performed angiography and checked her right renal artery using intravascular ultrasound. The ultrasound revealed thrombus formation and severe stenosis caused by the stent graft. We performed percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty at the ostium of her right renal artery. After this procedure, her renal function rapidly improved.
