The Ross procedure: outcomes at 20 years. Our study examines the outcomes of the Ross procedure in a cohort of 212 patients prospectively followed with clinical and echocardiographic assessments.Patients' mean age was 34 ± 9 years 66% were men and 82% had congenital aortic valve disease. The median follow-up was 13.8 years. Patients who had reoperations continued to be followed and entered into the survival analysis.There was 1 operative death as well as 9 late deaths (3 in patients who no longer had the Ross). Survival at 20 years was 93.6% and similar to the general population matched for age and sex. Fifteen patients required reoperations on the pulmonary autograft (4 repairs and 11 replacements), 8 on the pulmonary homograft, and 4 other cardiac procedures. At 20 years the freedom from reoperation on the pulmonary autograft was 81.8% and on the pulmonary homograft was 92.7%, and in both was 79.9%. Preoperative aortic insufficiency, aortic annulus diameter ≥15 mm/m(2), and being a man were associated with increased risk of reoperation on the pulmonary autograft. Twenty-six patients developed aortic insufficiency greater than mild and 25 patients developed pulmonary homograft dysfunction (defined as moderate or severe insufficiency and/or peak systolic gradient of >40 mm Hg). At 20 years the freedom from aortic insufficiency was 62.6% and freedom from pulmonary valve dysfunction was 53.5%.Survival after the Ross procedure in this cohort was similar to the general population. Dilated aortic annulus and aortic insufficiency were associated with increased risk of developing aortic insufficiency. Pulmonary homograft dysfunction was common at 20 years.
