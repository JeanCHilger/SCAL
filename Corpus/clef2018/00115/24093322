Inflammatory mediators and cerebral embolism in carotid stenting: new markers of risk. To investigate serological predictors of risk for cerebral embolism after carotid artery stenting (CAS).Twenty consecutive symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (13 men mean age 74 years) with carotid artery stenosis undergoing standardized filter-protected CAS (Wallstent) were preoperatively evaluated to identify unstable plaque (duplex ultrasound), complicated aortic plaque (transesophageal echocardiography), and inflammatory status [high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and serum amyloid-A protein (SAA) serum levels]. Aortic arch type, carotid tortuosity, and complexity of the procedure were considered. Cerebral embolism was evaluated by comparing the number, volume, and side (ipsilateral and non-ipsilateral) of preoperative and postoperative cerebral lesions detected on diffusion-weighted resonance magnetic imaging (DW-MRI) and through light and scanning electron microscopy analysis of cerebral protection filters obtained from CAS.All CAS procedures were completed with no complications. All patients had a negative preoperative DW-MRI, but at least 1 asymptomatic cerebral lesion appeared on DW-MRI after the procedure in 18 (90%) patients. Female gender was associated with a higher number of cerebral lesions (18.2±10.9 vs. 8.3±8.8 for men, p=0.03). Carotid plaque morphology, supra-aortic vessel anatomy, and procedure complexity did not correlate with number or volume of new cerebral lesions. Complicated aortic plaque was associated with a higher volume of non-ipsilateral cerebral lesions than uncomplicated plaque (235.0±259.3 vs. 63.6±63.2 mm(3), respectively p=0.02). Hs-CRP ≥5 mg/L and SAA ≥10 mg/L were significantly associated with a higher number of new cerebral lesions [16.2±10.7 vs. 4.3±3.4 for hs-CRP <5 mg/L (p=0.02) and 14.8±10.3 vs. 2.8±3.4 for SAA <10 mg/L (p=0.006), respectively]. Hs-CRP ≥5 mg/L and SAA ≥10 mg/L also correlated with greater surface involvement by embolic materials in the protection filters at microscopic analysis [37.0% (5.1%) vs. 26.9% (2.5%) for hs-CRP <5 mg/L, p=0.004In addition to female gender and the presence of complicated aortic plaque, inflammatory status can be a predictor of cerebral embolism in CAS.
