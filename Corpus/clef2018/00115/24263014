Management of blood transfusion in aortic valve surgery: impact of a blood conservation strategy. There are limited data in the literature concerning the effect of a blood conservation strategy (BCS) on aortic valve replacement (AVR) patients.From 2007 to 2011, 778 patients underwent AVR at a single institution. During this period, a multidisciplinary BCS was initiated with emphasis on limiting intraoperative hemodilution, tolerance of perioperative anemia, and blood management education for the cardiac surgery care providers.Mortality was 3.0% (23 of 778) overall and 1.7% (9 of 522) for isolated first-time AVR. There was no difference in rates of mortality (p = 0.5) or major complications (p = 0.4) between the pre-BCS and post-BCS groups however, the BCS was associated with a lower risk of major complications (odds ratio, 1.7Perioperative BCS reduced RBC transfusion in AVR patients without an increase in mortality or morbidity. Guidelines for BCS in routine cardiac operations should be extended to AVR patients.
