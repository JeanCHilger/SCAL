Aortic valve reconstruction using autologous pericardium for ages over 80 years. We performed original aortic valve reconstruction using autologous pericardium the feasibility for elderly patients is reviewed.From April 2007 through September 2011, aortic valve reconstruction was carried out in 86 patients over the age of 80 years. Twenty-seven patients were male and 59 were female. Mean age was 82.9 ± 2.5 years. Seventy-two patients had aortic stenosis and 14 had aortic regurgitation. Mean preoperative surgical annular diameter was 19.5 ± 2.5 mm. There were 80 (90.7%) cases of small aortic annulus. Mean preoperative logistic EuroSCORE was 22.9 ± 15.8.Isolated aortic valve reconstructions were performed in 51 patients. Concomitant procedures included coronary artery bypass grafting in 6, hemiarch aortic replacements in 6, 9 maze procedures, and some combinations. No conversion to valve replacement was required. Mean follow-up was 1243 days. There were 3 hospital deaths due to noncardiac causes. No reoperation was needed. Survival at 56 months was 87.0%. No thromboembolic event occurred. Echocardiography 3.5 years after surgery revealed an average peak pressure gradient of 14.6 ± 3.8 mm Hg. No moderate or severe regurgitation was recorded.Aortic valve reconstruction is feasible for patients older than 80 years, resulting in good hemodynamics and a better quality of life, without anticoagulation.
