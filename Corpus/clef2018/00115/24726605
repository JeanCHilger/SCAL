Incidence of postoperative stroke using the Heartstring device in 1,380 coronary artery bypass graft patients with mild to severe atherosclerosis of the ascending aorta. Atherosclerotic disease of the ascending aorta during coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) increases the risk for postoperative stroke. The objective of this study was to examine the incidence of postoperative stroke in CABG utilizing the Heartstring (Maquet Cardiovascular, San Jose, CA) proximal anastomotic device.Intraoperative epiaortic ultrasonography was used to grade atherosclerosis in CABG patients at Emory University from April 2003 to December 2012. The Heartstring device was utilized in 1,380 patients: 407 (29.5%) grade I (minimal atherosclerosis), 367 (26.6%) grade II, 437 (31.7%) grade III, 110 (8.0%) grade IV, and 59 (4.3%) grade V (severe atherosclerosis). Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the effect of aortic grade on outcomes adjusted for Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk of mortality and predicted risk of stroke scores.The mean age of all patients was 66.7 ± 10.5 years, and 31.9% were female. An increasing risk profile was apparent with rising aortic grade. Most CABG was done off pump (n = 1,277, 92.5%). There was no significant association between aortic grade and frequency of postoperative stroke (p = 0.83). In all patients, use of the Heartstring device reduced the predicted risk of stroke by 44% (O:E risk 0.56). The benefit for postoperative stroke was least apparent in the grade I aorta patients (O:E 0.8) compared with patients having grade II and greater. There were no strokes among patients with severe atherosclerosis using the Heartstring device.Compared with the Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk for stroke, the Heartstring proximal anastomotic device can be safely used with all aortic grades. The most prominent benefit appears to be for patients with grade II disease and greater.
