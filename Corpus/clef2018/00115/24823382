Hemodynamic performance of Trifecta: single-center experience of 400 patients. To evaluate postoperative hemodynamic gradients and early outcomes of aortic valve replacement with the Trifecta bioprosthesis.Between 2011 and 2013, 400 patients underwent aortic valve replacement with a Trifecta bioprosthesis. Gradients were calculated by transthoracic echocardiography before discharge. Data were collected retrospectively patients with postoperative severe left ventricular dysfunction or > mild mitral regurgitation were excluded.The mean age was 75.9 ± 8.5 years, 197 (49.25%) patients were male, and 140 (35%) were >80-years old. Concomitant procedures were performed in 207 (51.75%) patients, and 30 (7.5%) had redo procedures. Supraannular aortoplasty with bovine pericardium was necessary in 25 (6.25%) cases. Hospital mortality was 2.75% (11 patients). Postoperative peak and mean gradients were 21.7 ± 9.3 and 11.1 ± 4.3 mm Hg for 19-mm valves (n = 29) 19.5 ± 7 and 9.7 ± 3.6 mm Hg for 21-mm valves (n = 158)Early postoperative gradients are low after Trifecta implantation. Significant transvalvular regurgitation was not observed, but the incidence of supraannular aortoplasty may be increased.
