Endovascular repair of a thoracic aortic aneurysm in pregnancy at 22 weeks of gestation. Thoracic aortic aneurysm is a rare condition that carries a critical risk of rupture and mortality. These risks are increased during pregnancy because of a progressively hyperdynamic pattern of circulation. Simultaneously, pregnancy-imposed limitations on the use of ionized radiation and intravenous contrast agents may render conventional techniques for imaging and repair confirmation less acceptable. We describe a novel approach to intraoperative management of an endovascular repair for symptomatic thoracic saccular aneurysm in a pregnant patient, based on intravascular ultrasound and transesophageal echocardiography, with maintenance of uterine perfusion. The patient recovered well and proceeded to a normal delivery. Despite a favorable outcome in this case, further studies of perioperative management of aortic disease in pregnancy are needed.
