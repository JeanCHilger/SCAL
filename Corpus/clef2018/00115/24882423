Evaluation of the accuracy of aorta scan BVI 9600 in screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm. Despite a decreasing incidence of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), the cost-effectiveness of AAA ultrasound screening can be improved by reducing the screening costs and increasing the uptake rates. The BVI 9600 (BVI) is a promising tool for this purpose as it is inexpensive and can detect AAA without a trained operator. This study aims to investigate whether the BVI can be used to detect AAA for the purpose of a low-cost outreach screening approach.A total of 142 subjects had their abdominal aortae measured by five sonographers using the BVI and a conventional ultrasound machine. The examination included four anterior-posterior measurements at four equally spaced scanning locations from the xiphisternum to the umbilicus. The measurements produced by each machine were compared using Bland-Altman plots, followed by an analysis of the AAA detection performance.The BVI measured the aortic diameter to within 0.88-1.56 cm of the true diameter, exceeding the 0.5 cm "clinically acceptable difference" (CAD). Its accuracy was poorer when measuring the aneurysmal aortae (mean difference -0.56 cm, variability 1.72 cm) than normal aortae (mean difference 0.02 cm, variability 0.76 cm). Nine out of 52 aneurysms were not detected due to undersizing measurement and non-visualization of the aortae.At present, the BVI is not sufficiently accurate to detect AAA for screening purposes. A number of technical features require improvement.
