Long-term renin-angiotensin blocking therapy in hypertensive patients with normal aorta may attenuate the formation of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB), when given with angiotensin II prevents AAA formation in mice, but found ineffective in attenuating the progression of preexisting AAA. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of chronic RAS blockers on abdominal aortic diameter in hypertensive patients without known aortic aneurysm. Consecutive hypertensive outpatients (n = 122) were stratified according to antihypertensive therapy they received for 12 months or more, consisting of ARB (n = 45), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I n = 45), or nonARB/nonACE-I (control therapy
