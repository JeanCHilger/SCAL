Prevalence and severity of asymptomatic coronary and carotid artery disease in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm. We evaluated the prevalence and severity of occult coronary artery disease (CAD) and cerebrovascular disease (CeVD) in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). We studied 100 consecutive patients with no history of CAD, normal electrocardiogram, normal systolic function, and no angina or dyspnea. All patients underwent carotid Doppler study and invasive coronary angiography. Significant CAD was observed in 61% of patients. In all, 51% of patients with significant CAD showed either left main (n = 7), 3-vessel (n = 17), or proximal left anterior descending (n = 7) CAD, corresponding to 31% of the total cohort. Cerebrovascular disease was detected in 53% of patients, and in 38% of them was significant (peak systolic flow velocity â‰¥125 <230 cm/s). In 36% of patients with CeVD either left main (n = 5), 3-vessel (n = 11), or proximal left anterior descending (n = 3) CAD was observed. Severe asymptomatic CAD is prevalent in AAA, and 31% of patients fulfill indications for coronary revascularization.
