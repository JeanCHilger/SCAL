Dual-energy computed tomography after endovascular aortic aneurysm repair: the role of hard plaque imaging for endoleak detection. To assess the diagnostic accuracy of dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) for detection of endoleaks and aneurysm sac calcifications after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) using hard plaque imaging algorithms.One hundred five patients received 108 triple-phase contrast-enhanced CT (non-contrast, arterial and delayed phase) after EVAR. The delayed phase was acquired in dual-energy and post-processed using the standard (HPI-S) and a modified (HPI-M) hard plaque imaging algorithm. The reference standard was determined using the triple-phase CT and contrast-enhanced ultrasound. All images were analysed separately for the presence of endoleaks and calcifications by two independent readers sensitivity, specificity and interobserver agreement were calculated.Endoleaks and calcifications were present in 25.9 % (28/108) and 20.4 % (22/108) of images. The HPI-S images had a sensitivity/specificity of 54 %/100 % (reader 1) and 57 %/99 % (reader 2), the HPI-M images of 93 %/92 % (reader 1) and 96 %/92 % (reader 2) for detection of endoleaks. For detection of calcifications HPI-S had a sensitivity/specificity of 91 %/99 % (reader 1) and 95 %/97 % (reader 2), the HPI-M images of 91 %/99 % (reader 1) and 91 %/99 % (reader 2), respectively.Using HPI-M, DECT enables an accurate diagnosis of endoleaks after EVAR and allows distinguishing between endoleaks and calcifications with high diagnostic accuracy.• Dual-energy computed tomography allows the diagnosis of aortic pathologies after EVAR. • Hard plaque imaging algorithms can distinguish between endoleaks and aneurysm sac calcifications. • The modified hard plaque imaging algorithm detects endoleaks with high diagnostic accuracy.
