Interferon-gamma receptor 1 deficiency in a 19-month-old child: case report and literature review. To analyze the clinical manifestation of interferon gamma receptor 1 deficiency (IFN-γR1 deficiency) and to improve the recognition of this disease in children, decrease diagnostic errors and missed diagnosis.The information of one case with IFN-γR1 deficiency (past history of illness, clinical manifestation, laboratory examination and treatment) were analyzed.The patient was a 19-month-old girl with IFN-γR1 deficiency, 1-2 weeks after she was vaccinated with BCG at the age of 18 months, she manifested with lymph nodes at the same site as vaccination site, and repeated rash. Examination found a mass in the right armpit, the size was 3 cm × 3 cm, protruded on the skin, tenacious in nature, poorly mobile. B-mode ultrasound showed right armpit chest heterogeneous hypoechoic mass abdominal B-mode ultrasound showed pancreatic lymph nodes around the abdominal aorta and mild swellingIFN-γR1 is an extremely rare disease in children. If disseminated tuberculosis infection occured, especially after BCG vaccination, or if there were focal/multifocal bone tuberculosis, immune function with conventional detection is considered normal, then IFN-γR1 deficiency should be considered, and early genetic testing for confirming the diagnosis and selecting the appropriate treatment are needed.
