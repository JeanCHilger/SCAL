Follow-up of renal artery stenosis by duplex ultrasound. We have previously shown that duplex ultrasound is an accurate method of diagnosing renal artery stenosis (93% accuracy compared with angiography in the diagnosis of less than 60% stenosis, 60% to 99% stenosis, or occlusion). With this method we have now serially observed 35 renal arteries with 60% to 99% renal artery stenosis in 27 patients. Nineteen stenotic renal arteries in 15 patients were observed without intervention. There was a significant decrease in kidney size (mean difference - 1.0 cm p less than 0.01
