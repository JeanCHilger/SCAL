Application of a tape-like bandage for the ascending aorta in its poststenotic dilation and correction of the aortal valve stenosis. The aortal valve prosthesis in combination with a tape-like bandage of ascending aorta application was performed in 106 patients, suffering a failure with predominance of the aortal valve stenosis in conjunction with the ascending aorta poststenotic dilation, in a 2005 - 2014 yrs period in the clinic. The hospital lethality have constituted 0.9%. In accordance to echocardiography, the ascending aorta diameter preoperatively have constituted (48.7 +/- 1.4) mm at average, before discharge from the hospital--(40.1 +/- 1.2) mm, in late follow-up period--(41.3 +/- 1.2) mm. It is expedient to recommend the original method of a tape-like bandage of ascending aorta from the base of noncoronary sinus in the aortal sinuses dilation (45 mm and more) in combination with the aortal valve prosthesis in poststenotic dilation of ascending aorta.
