Effects of transcatheter aortic valve implantation on left ventricular and left atrial morphology and function. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an alternative treatment in surgically high-risk or inoperable patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). The objective of this study was to analyze the effects of TAVI on left ventricular (LV) and left atrial (LA) longitudinal function assessed by speckle tracking echocardiography (2DSTE) in patients with AS.In our prospectively conducted study, a total of 55 symptomatic (New York Heart Association class II or higher) patients with severe AS, considered to be at increased risk for undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement, were recruited (age: 78.6 ± 7.4 year). Patients underwent a complete clinical and laboratory evaluation, in addition to standard echocardiography and 2DSTE. Echocardiographic analysis was performed before and 6 months after TAVI. 2DSTE measured segmental and global longitudinal strain (GLS) and radial strain.All the patients received the CoreValve self-expanding prosthesis. Six months after TAVI, patients showed a significant reduction in mean transaortic gradient (52.1 ± 15.8 vs. 11.2 ± 3.3 mmHg, P < 0.0001), LV mass, LA volume index, and an improvement of ejection fraction (P < 0.0001). In addition, LV GLS (-11.8 ± 3.2 vs. -16.3 ± 4.2% P < 0.0001) and LA longitudinal strain (14.2 ± 5.4 vs. 26.6 ± 10.8%, P < 0.0001) significantly increased after TAVI. In a stepwise forward multiple logistic regression analysis, LV mass before TAVI (P < 0.001) and peak CK MB mass after TAVI (P < 0.0001) were powerful independent predictors of lower improvement of LV GLS. Moreover, LV mass index (P < 0.001) and LV GLS strain (P < 0.001) before TAVI were powerful independent predictor of LA longitudinal strain after TAVI CONCLUSIONS: TAVI in patients with AS resulted in geometric changes known as "reverse remodelling," and improved LV and LA function assessed by 2DSTE.
