Endovascular treatment of multiple aneurysms complicating Cogan syndrome. To report the use of endografts to manage multiple aneurysms due to Cogan syndrome (CS). A 38-year-old woman with descending thoracic aorta and right common carotid artery aneurysms due to CS was treated with endovascular grafts. After 4 years, angio computed tomography scan demonstrated complete exclusion of the aneurysms with no signs of endoleak, whereas echo color Doppler showed patency of the carotid graft, no signs of restenosis, no progression of the disease in the landing zones, and complete aneurysm exclusion. Endovascular repair seems to have favorable long-term outcomes and should be considered a viable alternative to surgery in unfit for open surgery patients, even if they are young, and when the aneurysm size and location would pose a higher risk of perioperative and postoperative complications after an open surgical procedure.
