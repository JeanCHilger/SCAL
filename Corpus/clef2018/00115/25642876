Use of acellular dermal matrix combined with a component separation technique for repair of contaminated large ventral hernias: a possible ideal solution for this clinical challenge. Repair of large contaminated ventral hernias is always challenging because of massive loss of muscular and fascial tissues, high risk of surgical infection and recurrence, and contraindication to use of a permanent prosthesis. This study reviewed retrospectively data of 35 patients with contaminated large ventral hernias who received repair using acellular dermal matrix combined with a component separation technique from 2009 to 2011. Twenty-one males and 14 females were identified with a mean age of 45.5 ± 12.5 years and a mean body mass index of 22.5 ± 5.8 kg/m(2). Simultaneously, nine patients underwent bowel fistula resection, 13 patients underwent ostomy takedown, five patients underwent recurrent colon cancer dissection, and eight patients underwent infectious permanent mesh removal and wound débridement. Mean defect size was 125.0 ± 23.5 cm(2). The aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle was transected and separated from internal oblique muscle to reach abdominal closure. Acellular dermal matrix was placed in an onlay fashion and mean mesh size was 300.0 ± 65.0 cm(2). Thirty-five patients had a mean follow-up period of 36.5 ± 12.5 months. Wound bleeding and partial dehiscence occurred at 36 hours postoperatively. Five patients reported abdominal wall pain during the first postoperative month. Five patients developed surgical site infection. Four patients were detected to develop seroma with volume more than 20 mL by B-ultrasound examination. No recurrence and chronic foreign body sensation were followed up. Use of acellular dermal matrix combined with a component separation technique is safe and efficient management for repair of contaminated large ventral hernia, in which permanent prosthesis placement is contraindicated.
