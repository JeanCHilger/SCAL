Aortic dimensions in relation to bicuspid and tricuspid aortic valve pathology. The relationship between aortic valve pathology and the aortic root and ascending aortic dimensions in cardiac surgery patients is unclear, and its clarification was the objective of this study.The severity of valve pathology, whether aortic valve stenosis (AS) or aortic valve regurgitation (AR), and the aortic dimensions (aortic root and ascending aorta) were prospectively evaluated with echocardiography in 500 consecutive patients with tricuspid aortic valve (TAV) or bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) who had undergone surgery due to aortic valve and/or ascending aortic disease.The distribution of valve pathology was similar in TAV and BAV patients when the aorta was non-dilated. However, when the aorta was dilated, AS was seen predominantly in BAV patients (n = 76) compared to TAV patients (n = 2). In TAV and BAV patients with non-dilated aortas, an increased severity of valve pathology was associated with smaller dimensions of the aortic root and the ascending aorta. In TAV and BAV patients with dilated aortas, an increase in the severity of AR was associated with a decreasing dimension of the ascending aorta but an increasing dimension of the aortic root. In BAV patients with aneurysm, the severity of AS was associated with a decreased dimension of the aortic root and the ascending aorta.Patients with AS and ascending aortic dilatation almost exclusively have a BAV. An increasing severity of valve pathology was related to decreasing dimensions of the aortic root and the ascending aorta, and the pattern was strikingly similar in TAV and BAV patients. The high frequency of ascending aortic dilatations in BAV patients cannot be explained by the valve pathology.
