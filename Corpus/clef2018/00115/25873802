Iliac artery aneurysm repair with preservation of a single ectopic pelvic kidney. An ultrasonographic study in a 60-year-old man incidentally detected an iliac artery aneurysm that gave rise to the renal artery of a single ectopic pelvic kidney. Renal-preservation solution could not be used during surgery, because the unclamped renal vein would have enabled the solution to enter the systemic circulation. Therefore, cold saline solution was infused through the renal ostium, and the kidney was maintained under cold saline immersion. We performed aortoiliac bypass and then implanted the renal artery into the bypass graft. Postoperatively, the patient's serum creatinine level increased after one year, his renal function was normal. We discuss our use of cold saline solution for renal preservation.
