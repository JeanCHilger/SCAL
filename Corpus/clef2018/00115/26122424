Life Saver: Aortic Wrapping. Reoperative aortic root reconstruction remains a formidable surgical challenge. Thereof, the wrapping of Dacron graft using remnants of native aorta may be reasonable to avoid complications such as bleeding and infection. Our case that had a modified Bentall procedure at our institute was reoperated because of discontinuity between left ventricular outflow and valved aortic conduit. During reoperation, proximal portion of the valved conduit was partially separated from its attachment in the left ventricular outflow tract. The residual native aorta that was wrapped around the Dacron graft was like in a shape of sac. This technique may play a major role in preventing rupture of the ascending aorta in case of separation of valved conduit from left ventricular outflow.
