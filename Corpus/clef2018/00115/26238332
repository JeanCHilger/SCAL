Treatment of iliac artery bifurcation aneurysms with the second-generation straight iliac bifurcated device. There are few long term studies to show the safety and efficacy of iliac artery aneurysm exclusion, especially in regards to the straight iliac branched device. The objective of our study was to add our data with a mean follow-up of 32 months to the existing data available.Patients undergoing iliac bifurcation procedure either as standalone or in combination with abdominal aortic aneurysm exclusion at two vascular centers had data prospectively gathered between 2004 and 2014. Collected data was analyzed for baseline characteristics, procedural events, and clinical follow-up variables included endoleaks, reinterventions, and internal iliac artery (IIA) closure.A total of 45 iliac vessels in 41 patients (36 male) with a mean age of 70.4 years were treated with the iliac branched device. Procedural success was achieved in 85% (35/41) of patients and 87% (39/45) vessels with no intraoperative death. Of the six technical failures, three occurred due to failure to place the straight iliac branched device or stent properly. Two occurred because of endoleaks at the end of the procedure, and one occurred because the IIA side-branch occluded and could not be reopened. The mean patient follow-up was 32.0 ± 27.3 months (range, 0-109 months). During this time period, the IIA patency rate on an intention-to-treat basis was 81%, and the freedom from endoleak rate on an intention-to-treat basis was 76% per patient. The freedom from reintervention per patient was 75%. No patient reported symptoms of pelvic ischemia and permanent buttock claudication.In this study with mean follow-up of 32 months, treatment with iliac bifurcated devices is a safe and durable option in a carefully selected population of patients with iliac artery bifurcation aneurysms.
