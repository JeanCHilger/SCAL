Hemodynamic and anatomic characteristics of the normal Mitroflow biological valve--in vivo determination using 2-dimensional echocardiography. In order to evaluate two-dimensional and Doppler echo-characteristics of normally functioning Mitroflow pericardial bioprosthesis (MPB) in aortic (AVR) and mitral (MVR) position, 26 patients were examined in their fifth postoperative week. None had clinical evidence of MPB disfunction. Echo contour of different parts of MPB, leaflet thickness and position of their coaptation line were assessed. Also, end-systolic and end-diastolic diameters with subsequently calculated percentage of left ventricular (LV) fractional shortening, were measured. Peak systolic velocity (Vmax) for AVR and peak diastolic velocity for MVR, pressure gradient (PG) and pressure half time were measured by continuous wave Doppler. Presence, extent and origin of MPB regurgitation were estimated by colour flow mapping. Echo contour of MPB leaflets, stents and sewing ring were smooth and without irregularities. Leaflet coaptation line was always in the middle between two adjacent stents and leaflet thickness was always less than 4 mm. LV function was good in all patients. Vmax for AVR = 1.8 +/- 0.54 m/sec, and for MVR = 1.4 +/- 0.41 m/sec p greater than 0.01. PG for AVR = 14 +/- 9 mmHg, and for MVR = 8 +/- 5 mmHg
