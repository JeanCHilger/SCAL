Bioprosthetic Valve Thrombosis Versus Structural Failure: Clinical and Echocardiographic Predictors. Bioprosthetic valve thrombosis (BPVT) is considered uncommon this may be related to the fact that it is often unrecognized. Recent data suggest that BPVT responds to vitamin K antagonists, emphasizing the need for reliable diagnosis.This study sought to determine the diagnostic features of BPVT and to formulate a diagnostic model for BPVT.Cases of BPVT occurring between 1997 and 2013 were identified from the Mayo Clinic pathology database. Patients with BPVT were matched 1:2 for age, sex, and prosthesis position with patients whose valves were explanted for structural failure. We formulated a diagnostic model for BPVT using multivariate linear logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic.Among 397 consecutive cases of explanted bioprostheses, there were 46 cases of BPVT (11.6% aortic 29, mitral 9, tricuspid 7, pulmonary 1), mean age was 63 years, and 68% were male. Thirty (65%) cases occurred >12 months post-implantationBPVT is not uncommon and can occur several years after surgery. A combination of clinical and echocardiographic features can reliably diagnose BPVT.
