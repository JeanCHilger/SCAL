Ultrasonographic screening of the abdominal aorta among siblings of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms. To evaluate the prevalence of abdominal aortic dilatations among asymptomatic brothers and sisters of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), an ultrasonographic screening study was performed. One hundred and two siblings of patients operated on for AAAs at two Swedish hospitals were invited to attend, and 87 of them (35 men and 52 women) from 32 different families, accepted the invitation. Their median age was 63 years (range 39-82 years). Aortic dilatation was diagnosed in ten of the brothers (29 per cent) and three of the sisters (6 per cent). In ten cases (eight men and two women) there was a localized dilatation caudal to the coeliac axis, and in three a general dilatation of the abdominal aorta with the diameter at the coeliac axis greater than 29 mm. None of the aortic dilatations had been known before this study was performed. The conclusion is that the prevalence of asymptomatic aortic dilatations among brothers of patients with AAAs seems to be high and that this group should be selected for further screening studies.
