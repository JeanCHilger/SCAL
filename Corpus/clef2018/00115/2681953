Flowmetry in the evaluation of hemodynamics of the lower limbs in chronic ischemia. Regional hemodynamics in the lower limbs was studied in 250 patients (480 lower limbs) with obliterative lesions of the abdominal aorta and lower limb arteries. Six levels of blood circulation were examined: the iliac segment, the femoral segment, the popliteal and tibial segments, the circulatory channels of the foot and toes. The suggested complex method of ultrasonic measurement of the blood flow in the lower limbs makes it possible to evaluate the hemodynamic significance of the collaterals and the adverse effect of the pathologically changed arterial segment on the regional hemodynamics. The conducted noninvasive study of hemodynamics allows the initial stages of the lesion to be detected (which physical examination fails to do in some cases) and adequate tactics of stage-by-stage treatment by surgery to be elaborated. The outcome of the reconstructive operation can be prognosed by determining the patency of the arterial arch of the foot and the leg arteries.
