Repair of truncus arteriosus in the neonate and young infant. Infants with truncus arteriosus present a difficult management issue. Because of the high operative mortality, repair is often delayed beyond the first 3 to 6 months of age. We reviewed our experience with 11 neonates and young infants with truncus arteriosus undergoing repair (median age, 21 days). Five patients also had major truncal valve insufficiency, and 2 required valve replacement. Right ventricle-pulmonary artery continuity was established with a porcine valved conduit in 3 patients and an aortic or pulmonary homograft in 8. There was 1 operative death (9% 70% confidence limits, 3%-22%) and 1 late death over a mean follow-up of 21 months (range, 4 to 32 months). Eight of the 9 late survivors are growing normally. Echocardiographic examination revealed normal ventricular function in all patients (mean shortening fraction, 39%). Doppler assessment demonstrated trivial prosthetic or homograft valve regurgitation in 7 patients and mild to moderate obstruction in 5 patients. This recent experience with repair of truncus arteriosus indicates that the operative risk is low even in the neonate. Repair in the first month of life should be recommended before the development of critical congestive heart failure or irreversible pulmonary vascular disease.
