Chronic rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Chronic rupture of the aorta is a rare condition. In this report, the presentation, diagnosis, and management of two patients with this complication is described. Chronic rupture may occur without hypotension and may mimic several other conditions. CT scans are superior to ultrasound in diagnosis and evaluation. Emergency repair is not necessary in clinically stable patients and careful preoperative planning may diminish morbidity and mortality.
