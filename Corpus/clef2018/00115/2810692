Echocardiographic assessment of aneurysm of the aortic valve caused by infective endocarditis--a case report. No aneurysm of the aortic valve associated with infective endocarditis has yet been reported. This report describes the clinical echocardiographic and pathologic findings in a patient who developed infective endocarditis resulting in aneurysm of the non-coronary cusp with aortic regurgitation. Surgical treatment was performed because of gradual expansion of the aneurysm and gradual thinning of its wall. Two-dimensional and color Doppler echocardiographies proved useful for the initial diagnosis and serial follow-up of this unusual case and for its successful surgical management.
