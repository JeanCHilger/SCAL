Doppler sonography in cardiologic diagnosis. Ultrasonic Doppler analysis of intracardiac blood flow is a technique complementary to echocardiographic imaging, and an important tool in non-invasive diagnosis. Doppler ultrasonography enables the evaluation of systolic murmurs, particularly the calculation of pressure gradients and valve areas in stenotic lesions. In patients with aortic stenosis, there was a very close correlation of invasive and non-invasive pressure gradients (r = 0.92). In patients with mitral stenosis, invasive and non-invasive valve areas were correlated as well (r = 0.78). In addition, regurgitant and shunting jets can easily be traced and assessed at least semi-quantitatively by using 2D-colour flow mapping, or 2D-duplex scanning. Doppler echocardiography is a prime aid in the evaluation of children and young adults, in whom cardiac catheterisation can often be omitted because there is no need for coronary arteriography. It is also an important tool in the follow-up of patients with cardiac valve prostheses, in particular bioprostheses. A time-dependent reduction of valve areas was noted in patients with aortic bioprostheses (r = -0.80).
