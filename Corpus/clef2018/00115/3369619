Magnetic resonance imaging versus angiography in the preoperative assessment of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Magnetic resonance is a cost-effective imaging tool in the preoperative evaluation of abdominal aortic aneurysm, and yields more clinically relevant information than ultrasonography and computerized tomography. Magnetic resonance imaging has advantages over angiography in that is costs substantially less, is noninvasive, and reconstructs images in multiple planes. By utilizing multiplanar imaging, magnetic resonance imaging yields more information than angiography. The position of the left renal vein is imaged only by magnetic resonance, as is the origin of the superior mesenteric artery. Angiography remains important in patients with associated occlusive disease and claudication. The use of magnetic resonance in the emergent setting is limited at this time.
