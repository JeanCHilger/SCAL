Doppler echocardiography in assessing mechanical and biological heart valve prostheses. The study was performed to assess Doppler echocardiographic features of mitral and aortic prosthetic valves of different types with both normal and abnormal function. Two hundred and twenty-three patients with 250 prostheses were studied. Two hundred eight valves (111 mitral, 95 aortic and 2 tricuspid) were considered to be functioning normally after clinical examination, phonocardiography and M-mode and 2D echocardiography. This group enabled us to define normal Doppler echocardiographic findings for different types of prosthesis. In mitral position, peak (p) and mean (m) gradients were lower for disc prostheses and higher for ball and biological prosthetic valves values of effective orifice area (A), calculated by pressure half-time method, were lower for biological and ball prostheses and higher in disc valves. Results were as follows: St. Jude (p 10.6 mmHg, m 3.9 mmHg, A 2.7 cm2), Duromedics (p 10.6, m 4.3, A 2.8), Björk-Shiley (p 10.4, m 4, A 2.3), Omniscience (p 14.2, m 6.2, A 2.1), Starr-Edwards (p 15.9, m 5.4, A 2.1), Hancock (p 14.7, m 6, A 2), Carpentier (p 13.2, m 5.4, A 1.9). Mild regurgitation, considered "physiological", was found in 2/8 Carpentier valves and in 3/34 St. Jude prostheses. In aortic valves lower peak gradients were found in Lillehei (18.3 mmHg), St. Jude (23.8 mmHg), Björk-Shiley (26 mmHg), Duromedics (27 mmHg) and higher values in Starr-Edwards (30.2 mmHg), Hancock (30 mmHg) and Omniscience (35.5 mmHg) prostheses. Mild regurgitation, considered "physiological", was found in 17% of Omniscience valves, 21% of Hancock, 33% of Duromedics, 45% of St. Jude, 60% of Björk-Shiley prostheses. Hancock mitral valves implanted for over 7 years had a mean gradient higher than valves with a shorter period of implantation (7.6 vs 4.85 mmHg, p less than 0.1), whereas the effective orifice area was similar. Hancock aortic valves implanted for over 7 years had a peak gradient slightly higher than the other group (implantation less than 7 years previously), but the difference was not statistically significant. Forty-two valves (19 aortic and 23 mitral) were considered to be malfunctioning. Regurgitation Doppler signals of malfunctioning valves appeared different from those of "physiological" reverse flow
