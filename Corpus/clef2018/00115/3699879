Effects of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia on vasodilatation in the rabbit. Vasodilator substances act either directly on vascular smooth muscle (e.g., adenosine) or indirectly (e.g., acetylcholine) on endothelial cells that respond by releasing an unknown powerful, short-lived relaxing factor. To determine whether chronic hypertension or hypercholesterolemia or both would alter the release of the endothelium-derived relaxing factor, experiments were performed in hypertensive rabbits (5-week cellophane wrap perinephritis mean blood pressure, 134.7 mm Hg) and normotensive rabbits (mean blood pressure, 80 mm Hg) with a Doppler flow transducer and perivascular balloon implanted on the lower abdominal aorta. Rabbits were fed either 1% cholesterol or control diet for 4 weeks before the experiment. On the day of the experiment, resting hindlimb vascular resistance was greatest in hypertensive rabbits fed 1% cholesterol diet, followed (in descending order) by hypertensive rabbits, normotensive rabbits fed 1% cholesterol diet, and normotensive rabbits. Pharmacological autonomic reflex blockade was induced, and steady state intravenous infusion curves to acetylcholine, serotonin, and adenosine were constructed. Sensitivity (location of effective dose, 50%) to the three vasodilator agents was altered less than twofold from the values in normotensive rabbits for any treatment group. The maximum vasodilator response to acetylcholine, but not to adenosine or serotonin, infusion was reduced significantly in the treated rabbits compared with that in normal rabbits. Reactive hyperemic responses to 5 to 80 seconds of ischemia were not significantly different among the treatment groups. These results indicate that hypertension with or without hypercholesterolemia does not greatly alter the responsiveness of the hindlimb resistance vasculature to these three vasodilator agents or to ischemia.
