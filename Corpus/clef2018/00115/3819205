Sinus of Valsalva aneurysm complicating bacterial endocarditis in an infant: diagnosis with two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography. Sinus of Valsalva aneurysm is a rare complication of bacterial endocarditis in infancy and childhood. This report describes an infant with congenital aortic stenosis who developed bacterial endocarditis after abdominal surgery and placement of indwelling central venous catheters for long-term parenteral nutrition. Bacterial endocarditis in this infant was complicated by the development of an aneurysm of the left sinus of Valsalva. Surgical intervention was necessary because of gradual expansion of the aneurysm with compression of the adjacent right pulmonary artery and descending aorta. Two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography proved useful for the initial diagnosis and serial follow-up of this unusual disorder and for its successful surgical management.
