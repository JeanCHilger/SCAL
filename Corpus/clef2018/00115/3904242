Determination of the blood pressure index with Doppler sonography--a method for the ambulatory control of late results following vascular reconstruction. Due to arterial obstructive disease of the lower extremity of aortoiliacal type the p.o. late results (3-9 years) after implantation of bifurcation prostheses are controlled. The establishment of a blood pressure index with the help of the Doppler sonography is in this case in supplementing the clinical findings after Fontaine a valuable method for objectivation in the ambulatory sector. The result of 88% of good and very good p.o. arterial blood supply of the extremities of the patients examined is to be regarded as satisfying.
