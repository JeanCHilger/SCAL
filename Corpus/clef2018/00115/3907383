Ultrasonographic and angiographic evaluation of polytetrafluoroethylene aortic bifurcation grafts. Arterial reconstruction in 50 consecutive male patients with aortoiliac aneurysmal or occlusive disease was performed with PTFE bifurcation grafts. Follow-up intervals ranged from 1 to 39 months. All patients were evaluated by physical examination at 19.5 +/- 1.3 months. In addition, 46 patients were evaluated by ultrasonography at 18.2 +/- 1.2 months, 19 by angiography at 19.8 +/- 2.2 months, and 4 by computerized axial tomography at 21.5 +/- 5.2 months. Intraluminal thrombus or pannus was found in one graft in a patient with compromised outflow, but all graft limbs were patent. There were no accumulations of perigraft fluid, graft dilatations, or anastomotic aneurysms. The results of this study provide support for the continued use of PTFE bifurcation grafts for aortic reconstruction.
