Abdominal aortic aneurysm in elderly patients. Selective management based on clinical status and aneurysmal expansion rate. The records of 125 patients 75 years of age or older with a diagnosis of unruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm were reviewed. Operative mortality was 4.3 percent in 69 patients considered at low risk and 39.8 percent in 13 patients at high risk who underwent aneurysmectomy shortly after diagnosis. Forty-three patients with an asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm initially measuring 3.5 to 6 cm did not undergo aneurysmal resection and were followed for 6 to 72 months (mean 24 months) with serial echography. The mean enlargement rate was 0.48 cm/year. In the 43 patients, resection of the abdominal aortic aneurysm was performed for aneurysmal expansion to greater than 6 cm, development of symptoms, or a sudden change in aneurysmal diameter. Two patients were lost to follow-up, 21 underwent elective resection, aneurysms ruptured in 2, 9 died from other causes, and 9 were alive and asymptomatic at last follow-up. An aggressive surgical approach seems appropriate, even in the asymptomatic elderly patient with a small aneurysm of 4.5 to 6 cm. Serial echographic measurement appears useful in determining which patients with a very small aneurysm of less than 4.5 cm or who are considered to be high risk surgical candidates require elective aneurysmectomy.
