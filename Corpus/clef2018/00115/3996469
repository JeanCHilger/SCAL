The cardiovascular effects of centrally and peripherally administered indoramin in conscious rats. Indoramin has centrally mediated hypotensive effects in anesthetized animals. In the present study, the cardiovascular effect of central and peripheral indoramin was determined in conscious, freely moving rats. Animals were instrumented with femoral arterial and venous catheters and miniaturized pulsed-Doppler flow probes were placed on the superior mesenteric and renal arteries and lower abdominal aorta. Injection of indoramin (25-100 micrograms) in the lateral cerebroventricle produced an immediate (1.5 min) increase in arterial pressure which was accompanied by vasoconstriction in all three vascular beds. By 10 min all values had returned to control except for heart rate which was decreased. Vehicle alone or intravenous indoramin (100 micrograms) had no effect. In baroreceptor-denervated rats smaller effects were seen. Intravenous indoramin (3.0-13.5 mg/kg) produced dose-related decreases in arterial pressure, heart rate, and hindquarter vascular resistance. The 13.5 mg/kg dose blocked to a similar degree the cardiovascular effect produced by intravenous norepinephrine or stimulation of the paraventricular nucleus. These data suggest that indoramin is an effective peripheral alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist but does not appear to be centrally active as a hypotensive agent.
