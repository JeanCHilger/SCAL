Aneurysms of the subrenal abdominal aorta. Apropos of 115 cases. 115 of infra renal abdominal aorta have been operated upon between 1969 and 1984. 107 male patients (93%) and 8 female (7%) were treated. Age was 65.5. Associated high blood pressure was found in 43%, smoking in 74% and coronary disease in 20.5%. Non ruptured aneurysms were 84 (73%) and diagnosis was made chiefly in ischemia of lower limbs, ruptured were 31 (27%). 4 fistulas between aorta and lower vena cava were found at surgery. Aortograms have not been done in every case, even for non ruptured aneurysms, as 19 patients have been operated without (22.6% of non ruptured aneurysms). Ultrasonography have been done in 37. Among 84 patients with non ruptured aneurysm, 6 were not operated, 2 got only palliative surgery for rest pain, and 76 (85.7%) underwent resection and grafting. 31 patients were operated when ruptured. Post operative mortality for non ruptured aneurysms was of 2 (2.63%) for resection and grafting. It was of 24 (77.4%) if ruptured. Follow-up study shows that at a five years range 62.7% of surviving operated patients are alive. Authors point out that lower limbs ischemia is still often a revealing symptom. Post operative colic ischemia is rare.
