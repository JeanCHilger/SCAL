Nonresective treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Use of acute thrombosis and axillofemoral bypass. In good-risk patients, abdominal aortic aneurysmectomy can be accomplished with a mortality of 2% to 5%. However, in poor-risk patients, ie, those with severe reduction of cardiac, respiratory, and/or renal function, the mortality of this procedure has been reported to be as high as 60%. Fifteen poor-risk patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms have been treated with acute, induced thrombosis and simultaneous axillobilateral femoral bypass. Each patient had preoperative ultrasound and radionucleide flow studies and the runoff from the aneurysm was determined angiographically. Thrombosis, induced by interruption of the iliac outflow vessels, occurred in 12 patients within 72 hours. Flow persisted in three patients, and thrombosis was induced by transaxillary catheter deposition of bucrylate in the residual outflow vessels. There were two operative deaths (less than 30 days), both due to myocardial infarctions, and four late deaths, three of which were caused by the problems that initially contraindicated direct graft replacement of the aneurysm. Preliminary experience with this approach indicates that this is a simple and potentially effective method of treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm where direct graft replacement is contraindicated.
