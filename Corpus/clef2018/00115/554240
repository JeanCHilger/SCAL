Ecographic studies of 72 aneurysms of the abdominal aorta (author's transl). The authors, studying 72 abdominal aortic aneurysms by ultrasounds, show the main diagnostic problems of this pathology. These aneurysms are divided into two classes: the silent and the acute ones the second group includes the atherosclerotic aneurysms in rupture and the dissecting aneurysms. Ecography is considered as a preliminar test in the evaluation of the aneurysms of the first group, allowing, in case of good results, the surgical operation without other invasive tests. Ultrasounds can also reduce problems of differential diagnosis. In case of non dissecting acute aneurysms, ecography leads to a quick diagnosis, allowing sudden surgery. In case of dissecting aneurysms, angiography remains the best examination, except those rare cases with atypical symptoms.
