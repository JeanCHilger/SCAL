Endoluminal angioplasty for atheromatous stenoses of supra-aortic trunks. The brachiocephalic arterial trunk, subclavian arteries. The authors are reporting their experience about percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in atheromatous stenosis of proximal supra-aortic arteries. In this series of 12 patients, with an 6 months follow-up, vertigo was the main clinical symptom (6 cases), and it must be pointed out that 5 of these 6 patients also underwent a proximal angioplasty of one or the two of their vertebral arteries at the same time. Two subclavian steal syndromes, one arterial insufficiency of an upper limb, one transient cerebral ischaemia, and two asymptomatic cases were also treated by the same procedure. For diagnosis as well as for follow-up, the authors are emphasizing the value of hemodynamic results of Doppler recording. As for the technics itself, it mainly derives from the PTA of the lower limbs arteries. The results in this series appear to be good from an hemodynamic point of view, with neither morbidity, nor mortality.
