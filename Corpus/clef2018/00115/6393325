Thoracic aortic aneurysms. The various pathological types of aneurysm are reviewed and their natural history discussed in relation to morphology, etiology and site of the aneurysm. For diagnostic purposes, computed tomography is a reliable method in the detection of aortic aneurysm for evaluation of the ascending segment, ultrasonography may also be considered a useful procedure. The two non-invasive methods are particularly valuable in monitoring patients with thoracic aneurysms not (yet) suitable for surgery. In the light of the literature and our own experience, practical guidelines for adequate treatment of non-dissecting aneurysms of the thoracic aorta are elaborated with respect to aneurysm site. In patients with anulo-aortic ectasia, surgical treatment is clearly indicated in the presence of typical Marfan syndrome and in cases showing a demonstrable increase of aneurysm dilatation and/or of aortic regurgitation (hospital mortality 5% in our experience)
