The primary role of ultrasound in evaluating right-sided diaphragmatic humps and juxtadiaphragmatic masses: a review of 22 cases. Twenty-two successive patients presenting with localised humps on the right hemidiaphragm or juxtadiaphragmatic masses, as revealed on standard chest radiographs, were submitted for ultrasound examination. These were carried out irrespective of the patient's symptoms. Ultrasonography provided a useful adjunct to conventional chest radiography and accurately defined the extent of diaphragmatic humps and the contents of diaphragmatic herniations and juxtadiaphragmatic masses, clearly defining their relationship to the adjacent organs. In most cases further radiological investigations were unnecessary.
