Femoral anastomotic false aneurysms. An 11-year experience analyzed with a case control study. Eighty-three femoral anastomotic false aneurysms occurring in 51 patients were diagnosed from 1972 through 1982. Twenty-two (27%) presented with acute events. Seventy (84%) were confirmed by sonography and/or arteriography. Bilaterality (29%), recurrence (18%), and associated aortic false aneurysms (8%) were significant problems. Eight-one were repaired with a six per cent complication rate, including one death related to preoperative rupture. The 51 patients were evaluated for associated illnesses, risk factors, and etiologies of their false aneurysms. The most common single cause (61%) was host vessel degeneration with an intact suture line remaining attached to a disrupted Dacron limb. Twenty-three patients with host vessel degeneration were matched with case controls not developing false aneurysms. These two groups were matched for gender, age, and year of AFB and compared for associated illnesses and risk factors. Incidences of cigarette smoking, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, previous femoral endarterectomy, outflow disease, other aneurysmal disease, multiple groin operations, wound complications, and training levels of surgeons performing initial AFBs were similar for both groups. Factors observed significantly more often in patients who developed false aneurysms included serum lipid abnormalities (p less than 0.05), braided synthetic suture material as opposed to monofilament polypropylene (p less than 0.05), and continued abuse of tobacco following AFB (p less than 0.005).
