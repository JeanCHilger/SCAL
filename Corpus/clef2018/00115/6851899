Diagnosis of thoracic aortic aneurysms with 2-dimensional echography. Eight patients with thoracic aortic aneurysms were investigated by angiography, computed tomography and two-dimensional echography. According to results of computed tomography or angiography six patients had a dissecting aortic aneurysm (five patients type 1 and one patient type 3 according to DeBakey) and two patients had a thoracic aortic aneurysm without dissection. In addition, thrombi in the descending aorta were shown in three patients by computed tomography or by angiography. Type and extent of the aneurysms could be evaluated by two-dimensional echography in all patients. Only in one patient could the origin of dissection in the ascending aorta not be localised precisely by echography. In three patients thrombi in the descending aorta could be demonstrated. For assessment of type and extent of the aneurysm the suprasternal approach was superior to precordial, subcostal and apical imaging. Parasternal investigation resulted in echographic demonstration of dissection in only two cases. Two-dimensional echography is a technically less demanding and useful method in the diagnosis of thoracic aortic aneurysms.
