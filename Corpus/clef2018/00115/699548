Ultrasonography and CT scanning: a comparative study of abdominal aortic aneurysms. CT scanning has been successfully used in the evaluation of the abdominal aorta in over 70 patients. Half of this group, with abdominal aneurysms, was also studied by ultrasonography and the results compared. Both techniques proved equally reliable in the diagnosis of this entity. Closer correlation to the aneurysmal diameter measured at surgery was obtained by CT scanning underestimation of size by ultrasonography was a frequent finding. Aortic lumen and intra-aneurysmal thrombus were also more clearly demonstrated by CT when contrast enhancement was added. Evaluation of aneurysmal length is done more effectively by ultrasonography although sagittal reconstruction by CT has been now attempted.
