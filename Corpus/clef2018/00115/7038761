Facilities and limitations of ultrasonography (US) applied to the abdominal aorta are demonstrated. The importance of US in establishing the diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is assessed and compared with the results of other imaging diagnostic procedures. In cooperation with the vascular surgeon the value of these different diagnostic approaches and its influence to therapeutic decisions is outlined. Based on a modern surgical approach the range of order for the use of the various diagnostic methods depending on the clinical stage of AAA is presented.
