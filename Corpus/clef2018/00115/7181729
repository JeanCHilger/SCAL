Flow characteristics of the St. Jude prosthetic valve: an in vitro and in vivo study. The St. Jude cardiac prosthetic aortic valve was evaluated in vitro and in vivo in an attempt to establish flow characteristics and to correlate them with clinical findings. In vitro, a fluid vehicle (6% Polyol V-10, 32 degrees C) with viscosity similar to blood (0.035 dyne-sec/cm2) was used under conditions of steady flow through a flow chamber simulating the aortic root. Gradient, velocity, and shear stress were measured 5.79 mm, 26.79 mm, 44.79 mm, and 77.79 mm downstream from 25-mm and 27-mm valves using a laser-Doppler anemometer. At 417 ml/sec, the valve gradient was 6.2 mmHg with the 25-mm valve, and 5.2 mmHg with the 27-mm prosthesis. Velocity was maximum at the orifice center, and wall shear stress was low (maximum 600 dyne/cm2). In vivo, six patients with 25-mm St. Jude aortic valves were studied within 48 hours after surgery to determine cardiac output, valve flow, and gradient. The gradient was 3.3 +/- 1.9 mmHg (M +/- SD) at 249 +/- 96 ml/sec and the effective valve area was as large as the geometric area (2.58 vs. 3.09 cm2). Thus, flow through the St. Jude valve is unobstructed and central, has low turbulence, and achieves optimal effective valve area for a given available orifice area.
