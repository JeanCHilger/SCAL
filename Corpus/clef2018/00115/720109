Comparison of computed tomography and ultrasound for abdominal aortic aneurysms: a preliminary study. Computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound were equally effective in measuring the external diameter of atherosclerotic abdominal aortic aneurysms in 20 patients. Ultrasound was superior for determining the true lumen caliber and detecting mural thrombi. CT was superior for demonstrating aortic wall calcifications, but no more so than a plain film abdominal radiograph. Ultrasound should be the method of choice in the diagnosis, serial evaluation and management of a patient with an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
