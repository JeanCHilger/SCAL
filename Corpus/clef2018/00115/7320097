Contribution of computed tomography to the exploration of aortic aneurysms (author's transl). A technique for exploring aortic aneurysms is described, and the results analysed in 50 cases (11 thoracic, 32 abdominal, 3 multiple, and 4 with both thoracic and abdominal aneurysms). The diagnostic value of this method appears evident for aneurysms in the thorax, and it can reduce the need for conventional radiological examinations. Results of examination of abdominal aneurysms were compared with those of ultrasonography and angiography. Angiography was more effective for studying collateral lesions, while ultrasonography is still a reliable, non-aggressive, low cost investigational procedure. Computed tomography, however, represents the most polyvalent, non-aggressive technique for evaluating the size of the aneurysm, its thrombotic components, and its extension to neighbouring organs.
