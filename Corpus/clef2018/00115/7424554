Diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysms by aortography, computer tomography and ultrasound. Aortography, computer tomography and ultrasound were compared with respect to the diagnosis and evaluation of abdominal aortic aneurysms. The results show that ultrasound should be the method of choice for diagnosis and that the extension of the aneurysm towards the renal arteries is best evaluated by computer tomography. Aortography can thus be omitted in most cases.
