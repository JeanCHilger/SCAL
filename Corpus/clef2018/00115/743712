The complementary role of sonography and arteriography in the evaluation of the atheromatous abdominal aorta. Sonography was performed on 41 patients, 24 of whom were suspected of having abdominal aortic aneurysms and 17 of whom had symptomatic peripheral vascular disease. The accuracy of sonography in the diagnosis of aneurysms of the abdominal aorta was evaluated, and the instances in which angioggraphy contributed to the management of these patients was defined. Sonography is adequate for the diagnosis and management of many aneurysms of the abdominal aorta. Aortography is necessary when: (1) an inadequate study has been obtained, (2) the iliac arteries are not visualized, (3) renal or mesenteric artery involvement is suspected, (4) multiple or lobulated aneurysms are found, or (5) the aorta is very tortuous.
