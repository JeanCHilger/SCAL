Fourteen-year experience with homovital homografts for aortic valve replacement. Two hundred seventy-five unprocessed, viable homograft ("homovital") aortic valves were used for aortic valve replacement in patients aged 1.5 to 79 years (mean 45.8 +/- 19 years) with maximum follow-up of a 14-year period (mean 4.8 years). Ninety-two percent (252 patients) had New York Heart Association class III or IV functional status before operation and 25 underwent emergency operation. Valves were harvested under sterile conditions and kept in nutrient medium 199. Freehand (subcoronary) technique was used in 147 patients and freestanding root replacement was used in 128. Cumulative survival rates for the whole group were 92% +/- 2% at 5 years and 85% +/- 3% at 10 years, as compared with 96% +/- 2% and 94% +/- 4%, respectively, for the 98 patients who underwent isolated root replacement. Multivariate analysis determined that root replacement with associated procedures and operation for prosthetic endocarditis were risk factors for death, whereas previous xenograft valve, operation for endocarditis, and operation for aortic regurgitation were risk factors for reoperation. Actuarial rates for freedom from degenerative valve failure diagnosed at operation, by postmortem examination, or by routine echocardiography were 94% +/- 2% at 5 years and 89% +/- 3% at 10 years. Recipient age younger than 30 years and previous xenograft valve were risk factors for late degeneration. We conclude that homovital valves demonstrate good durability, particularly in patients older than 30 years, who had a 10-year freedom from degeneration rate of 97%.
