Doppler echocardiographic comparison of small (19 mm) bileaflet and pericardial heart valve prostheses in aortic position. The resting haemodynamics of five types of small (19 mm) aortic valve prosthesis (2 bileaflet, 3 pericardial) were evaluated with Doppler echocardiography in 43 patients. Two received St Jude Medical and six CarboMedics bileaflet valves and 35 were given bioprostheses--16 Ionescu-Shiley, four Mitroflow and 15 Labcor-Santiago. No significant differences in peak or mean transvalvular pressure drop or in effective valve area were found between the bileaflet and the pericardial valves or among the three types of bioprosthesis. All but one of the bileaflet prostheses showed a characteristic regurgitation pattern, with two lateral and one central jet, and 16 (46%) of the bioprostheses showed central regurgitation, but in no case were these jets haemodynamically significant. Thus the 19 mm bileaflet and the studied pericardial prostheses all have satisfactory resting haemodynamics, and all are suitable for implanting in small aortic roots.
