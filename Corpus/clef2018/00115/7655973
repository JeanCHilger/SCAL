Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms and associated risk factors in a general population. To evaluate the prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) in a general population and to compare the results with those of similar studies in other countries.Ultrasound screening study and collection of clinical and biochemical data.An urban Health Service District in Genoa, Italy.A general population, aged 65-75 years, invited by personal letter between 1991-1994.1601 subjects (741 males and 860 females) out of 2734 invited (58.5%) were evaluated. According to the ultrasound findings, 27 patients (1.7%) had an aortic dilatation of 26-29 mm an AAA of 30-39 mm was found in 37 (2.3%) and an AAA > or = 40 mm in 33 (2.1%). The overall prevalence for AAA was 4.4% (8.8% in males and 0.6% in females respectively). The prevalence of smoking, alcohol consumption, coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and arterial disease were significantly higher in patients with AAA (p < 0.01).Ultrasound screening for AAA is a reliable and useful method and should be focused on men, regardless of concurrent disease.
