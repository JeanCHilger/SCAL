A comparative evaluation of externally supported polytetrafluoroethylene axillobifemoral and axillounifemoral bypass grafts. We analyzed a current 78-month experience with externally supported (ringed) polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) axillobifemoral (AxBF) and axillounifemoral (AxUF) bypass grafts to address the controversy about whether the addition of a femorofemoral limb to an axillofemoral bypass graft improves the patency results.Between January 1988 and June 1994, 36 AxBF and 22 AxUF externally supported PTFE ringed bypass grafts were performed at our institution. The age of the patients in the AxBF group was 67 +/- 11 years and 69 +/- 11 years in the AxUF group. The male/female ratio was 22:13 (AxBF) and 8:9 (AxUF). In 71% of cases (29/36 AxBF, 12/22 AxUF), the operations were performed for aortoiliac atherosclerotic occlusive disease in patients with significant medical risk factors or a "hostile" abdomen. The remaining 29% were patients requiring revascularization during treatment of an infected aortic graft. Bypass patency was assessed in the follow-up period by clinical evaluation, color-flow duplex imaging, or segmental limb pressure measurements.There was no significant difference in the 30-day operative mortality rate for all AxBF bypasses (11%) and all AxUF bypasses (6%) (p = 0.89 by chi-squared testing). The primary and secondary patency rates for the whole group of bypasses were 80% and 89% at 3 years, respectively (SE < 0.1). Between the AxBF and AxUF groups, there were no significant differences in either primary patency (80% for each group) or secondary patency (91% in AxBFs vs 85% in AxUFs) (SE < 0.1) at 2 years (Wilcoxon rank sum test).These data show no differences in the patency of externally supported PTFE AxBF and AxUF bypass grafts up to 2 years after implantation.
