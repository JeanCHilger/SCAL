Usefulness of a prototype intravascular ultrasound imaging in evaluation of aortic dissection and comparison with angiographic study, transesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of information obtained with a prototype intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) system in chronic aortic dissection by comparing results with angiography, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging. We assigned 15 patients to IVUS imaging after they underwent angiography. The detection rate of the intimal flap was 100% in all segments of the aorta, and the detection rate of the intimal tear was 0%, 50%, 50%, and 77.8% in the ascending, arch, descending, and abdominal aorta, respectively. IVUS demonstrated 100% of the celiac and renal arteries, and 80% of the superior mesenteric arteries as well as their relation to dissection. It clarified the origin of 12 of 60 main abdominal branches (20%) which were not clear on the angiogram. It also determined the distal extent of the dissection in all cases. With regard to the size of the vessel, there was a good correlation between IVUS and computed tomographic values (r = 0.98, p < 0.01). No complications occurred in any patient. IVUS accurately demonstrated thrombus or spontaneous echo contrast in the false lumen that was confirmed with computed tomography or TEE, or both. It was especially useful in evaluating the abdominal aorta with regard to determining the size of the vessel, the extent of dissection, the relation of the branches to the false lumen, and the detection of intimal tears--important information for follow-up of patients and for planning surgery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
