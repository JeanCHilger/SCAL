Duplex scanning for grading aortoiliac obstructive disease and guiding treatment. Standard assessment of aortoiliac obstructive disease (AIOD) includes arteriography preferably supplemented with femoral artery pressure (FAP) measurements. This study investigated the value of Duplex scanning in classifying AIOD and compared the outcome of Duplex scanning with clinical decision making. One-hundred-and-fifty-three aortoiliac segments of 87 patients were prospectively examined by Duplex scanning, arteriography, and FAP measurements to establish the presence or absence of significant AIOD. The results of these tests were compared to each other and to the subsequent vascular interventions and their success rates. Excellent agreement (kappa 0.82) was found between Duplex scanning and arteriography. The agreement between Duplex scanning and FAP measurements was much lower (kappa 0.52). The correlation between the performed treatment and the assessment of AIOD by Duplex scanning or arteriography was good, whereas the FAP results correlated only moderately with the performed treatment. Endovascular or operative treatment was actually performed in only 63% of the aortoiliac segments with an abnormal FAP test (success rate 80%). Aortoiliac segments with significant AIOD according to arteriography or Duplex scanning were treated invasively in 86% (success rate 81%) and 82% (success rate 80%), respectively. In conclusion, Duplex scanning can replace arteriography as a screening tool for the identification of treatable aortoiliac lesions whereas the value of FAP measurements in the decision making process is limited.
