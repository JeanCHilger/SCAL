Percutaneous tricuspid valvuloplasty. The authors herein describe the case of a 44 year old woman, who 14 years ago underwent surgical intervention after a rheumatic disease. A double mitral-aortic valvular implantation and a tricuspid commissurotomy was carried out. The patient come under our observation for severe congestive heart failure, while both mechanical prostheses were working well. Furthermore, the Doppler echocardiography showed a severe tricuspid stenosis (mean gradient = 8.6 mm Hg) and a concurrent mild to moderate valvular regurgitation. Because of her poor clinical condition and due to the high surgical risk it was decided to perform a balloon valvuloplasty of the tricuspid stenosis. The procedure, using the percutaneous femoral approach, was carried out with a TRIAD-TWIN AT (diameter = 18 + 18 mm length = 4 cm
