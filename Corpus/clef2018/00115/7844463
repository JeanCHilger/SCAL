Inter-observer variability in ultrasonic evaluation of abdominal aortic aneurysms. This study was undertaken to assess the consistency in 16 independent observations of the diameters of abdominal aortic aneurysms by diagnostic ultrasound. Confidence intervals were developed for the anterior-posterior dimension and the transverse dimension. Clinical treatment decisions should be made with appreciation that measurements of diameter increases greater than 0.21 cm in the anterior-posterior dimension and 0.31 cm in the transverse dimension are significant and are not a result of inter-observer variation.
