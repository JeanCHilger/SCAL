Bifurcated stent-grafts for endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm. Preliminary case reports. This report describes the first clinical experience with transfemoral insertion of an endovascular bifurcated graft for repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Graft placement was performed through bilateral femoral arteriotomies. There was no graft migration, no leakage, and unobstructed flow to the common iliac arteries was documented by angiography and Duplex ultrasonography in both cases. Both patients were eating a normal diet and ambulating on the first postoperative day.
