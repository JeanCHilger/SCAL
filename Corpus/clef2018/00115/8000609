Hemodynamic assessment of the stentless Toronto SPV bioprosthesis by echocardiography. Since March 1993 the Toronto SPVTM bioprosthesis has been implanted in 100 patients. Our prospective study evaluated the echocardiographic valve characteristics and the influence of the echocardiographic assessment on surgical technique. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was applied before and during surgery, and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) postoperatively. The average valve size implanted was 26.5 mm. Follow up was complete in 74 patients at six months and in 38 patients at one year. Pre-cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) TEE valve sizing was accurate by +/- 1 mm in 81 patients as compared to mechanical sizing. Post-CPB valve closure was concentric in 99 patients. Minimal aortic incompetence was present in seven patients at one week, in two patients at six months and in one patient at one year. Mean pressure gradients ranged from 7.7 to 11.1 mmHg postoperatively. Overall mortality was 4%. One patient with non-structural dysfunction and another with endocarditis at one year postoperatively were reoperated successfully. At follow up there was a significant decrease in transvalvular pressure gradients and an increase in valve orifice areas. In 32 patients a decrease in left ventricular posterior wall (LVPW) hypertrophy was found (p < 0.001). There was a decrease in tissue depth and recurrence of the dynamic movement of the aortic root. It is concluded that TEE valve sizing is reliable for early valve selection. Valve incompetence is not a clinically relevant issue using the oversizing technique. Improved hemodynamics at follow up can be explained by remodeling of the aortic root and by a decrease in left ventricular hypertrophy. The excellent hemodynamic profile, resembling native aortic valve function, is impressive and has to be confirmed by long term evaluation.
