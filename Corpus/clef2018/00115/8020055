Rest and exercise hemodynamics of stentless porcine bioprostheses in aortic position. Mechanical and conventional stented bioprostheses, because of need for anticoagulants, hemodynamic characteristics and long-term durability, do not represent the optimal heart valve replacement device. In this study we compared the hemodynamic function of a stented aortic bioprosthesis (St Jude Bioimplant), implanted in 10 patients, with a stentless porcine aortic bioprosthesis (Biocor) implanted in 7 patients, by means of Doppler echocardiography early postoperative at rest (T1) and 6 months later at rest (T2a) and during exercise (T2b). Mean and peak systolic gradients across stentless porcine prostheses were significantly lower than across stented bioprostheses (T1 p = 0.008 and p = 0.004 T2a p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001
