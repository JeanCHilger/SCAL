The new stentless aortic valve: clinical results of the first 100 patients. From May 1990 to August 1993, 100 patients underwent aortic valve replacement using the stentless porcine aortic valve. There were 69 males and 31 females. The mean age was 36 (range 11-76) years. Of 70 patients under 40 years of age, 20 were less than 20 years old. Indications included rheumatic heart sequelae in 55 patients (first valve replacement), prosthetic failure in 20, endocarditis in 13, congenital aortic bicuspid valve in four, degenerative disease in four and senile calcified aortic valves in four. Twenty patients had aortic annular related pathology. There were 15 associated surgical procedures. Forty-three patients required aortic root enlargement. There were approximately equal numbers of patients in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classes III and IV. The hospital mortality rate was 6% 14 patients who experienced hospital morbidity had a full recovery. Two late reoperations were performed in patients with primary valve endocarditis
