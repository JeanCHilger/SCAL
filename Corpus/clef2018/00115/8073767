Comparison of surgical techniques and various suture materials for correction of aortic isthmus stenosis. Clinical examination and Doppler ultrasound were performed in 31 children after repair of coarctation of the aorta. Median postoperative follow-up period was 4.5 years. The aim of our study was a comparison of different operation techniques and suture materials. In 16 infants subclavian flap repair had been performed using polydioxanone absorbable sutures (PDS) in 8 cases and polypropylene (Prolene) sutures in the other 8 cases. Resection and end-to-end repair had been carried out in 8 infants using PDS and in 7 using Prolene sutures. Doppler-echocardiographically derived gradients across the reconstructed aorta were significantly lower in infants operated with the subclavian flap technique (p < 0.05). The length of the arm on the side of the subclavian flap operation was shorter (median 1.2 cm), but there were no signs of ischaemic complications. Using PDS sutures the aortic arch and the aortic isthmus were each morphologically significantly wider in both operation techniques. Noninvasive two-dimensional echocardiography demonstrated good anatomical repair and no anastomotic aneurysm formation after aortic repair using polydioxanone.Regarding the doppler-echocardiographically derived gradients in the anastomotic region this intermediate follow-up study reveals better results using the subclavian flap technique absorbable polydioxanone sutures favour normal growth of the anastomotic site without vascular complications.
