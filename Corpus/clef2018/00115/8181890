Improved Doppler assessment of the Bjork-Shiley mitral prosthesis using the continuity equation. To assess whether derivation of an effective mitral prosthetic valve area using the continuity equation provides an improved functional assessment of the Bjork-Shiley mitral prosthesis over the pressure half-time method, Doppler echocardiographic studies were performed in 43 patients 12 +/- 7 months following the valve replacement. Effective valve orifice area used as the standard for comparison was determined by a hydraulic formula validated in vitro over a wide range of flow rates. All patients were clinically stable, without evidence of prosthetic dysfunction or aortic regurgitation. Prosthetic mitral valve orifice area determined by the hydraulic formula, by the continuity equation and by pressure half-time method for all prostheses sizes averaged 1.6 +/- 0.46 cm2, 1.83 +/- 0.56 cm2 and 2.34 +/- 0.48 cm2, respectively. Effective valve orifice area by the hydraulic formula had a strong correlation with that derived by the continuity equation (r = 0.86 P < 0.0001
