Long-term follow-up with various Dacron bifurcation prostheses. 5-years results of a prospective randomized study. In the frame of a prospective randomised study various Dacron bifurcation prostheses with or without velours or with or without gelatin impregnation were implanted in one hundred patients. Fifty-four patients could be reexamined clinically and sonographically after an average of 66 months. A total of 23 patients had died during the period of observation. A comparison of the Fontaine stages during reexamination indicated in 72.3% of cases an operation-related improvement as compared to the condition in the preoperative stage. Sonographically, an average dilatation of 17.3% could be proved. A significant difference due to material or impregnation was not observed. After 72 months the limb salvage amounted to 83.0%. A comparison of the various types of prostheses regarding their limb salvage could indicate no significant difference in the course of 72 months. Based on the only slightly differing results within the period of observation, only the more comfortable intraoperative handling leads to giving preference to the use of double velours prostheses in comparison to prostheses without velours. A positive influence of impregnation with gelatin could not be established.
