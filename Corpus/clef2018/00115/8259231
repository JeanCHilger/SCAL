Doppler echocardiographic evaluation of functional parameters of mechanical and biological valve prostheses. We studied and compared functional parameters in 314 valvular prostheses. The following parameters have been calculated: mean transvalvular gradients for aortic and mitral prostheses and functional area by Pht (pressure half time) for mitral prostheses. All patients with important depression in myocardial function, tachycardia or malfunctioning prostheses were excluded. 173 prostheses were in aortic position and 141 in mitral position. Mitral prostheses were: 31 biological and 110 mechanical. We subdivided mechanical prostheses in monoleaflet (Omnicarbon, Sorin-Carbocast and Allcarbon, Medtronic, Bjork-Shiley) and bileaflet (Sorin-Bicarbon, St. Jude). These three groups were compared: mean transvalvular gradients and area showed no differences. Aortic prostheses were: 33 biological and 140 mechanical mechanical prostheses were subdivided in two groups: monoleaflet (Sorin Allcarbon e Carbocast, Bjork-Shiley, Medtronic, Omnicarbon) and bileaflet (Sorin-Bicarbon, St. Jude). Mean transvalvular gradients of these three groups were compared within each group for every size: bileaflet prostheses demonstrated inferior gradients than biological and monoleaflet for 19-21 and 23 sizes
