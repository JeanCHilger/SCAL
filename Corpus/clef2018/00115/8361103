Transcranial Doppler monitor in the case of selective cerebral perfusion. Six patients underwent ascending aorta and aortic arch replacement for aneurysmal disease between 1991.12-1992.2 using the cardiopulmonary bypass technique with selective cerebral perfusion from right axillary artery. For four patients, intraoperative transcranial Doppler monitorings of left MCA flow velocity were done. We added left carotid artery perfusion for 5 patients because of old age 1, intraoperative finding of anisocoria
