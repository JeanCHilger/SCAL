Retrograde ascending aortic dissection: a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Aortic dissection with an entrance tear in the transverse aorta is generally considered to have the highest acute fatality rate of any type of dissection and the direction of its extension is the most difficult to predict. In a prospective study, we evaluated 61 consecutive patients (mean age 56.7 years, ranging from 21 to 75 years), presenting with ascending aortic dissection during a 36-month-period and tried to clarify the incidence of retrograde ascending aortic dissection. In 49 patients (80.3%), the intimal tear was located in the ascending aorta, whereas the dissection originated in the transverse aorta in 12 patients (19.7%) in this latter group, extension was strictly retrograde in 5 patients and in both directions in 7 patients. Three patients died before operation
