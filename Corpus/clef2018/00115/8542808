The perforation of a right-coronary sinus of Valsalva aneurysm into the right atrium. A 58-year-old man [correction of woman] without previous cardiac symptoms developed exertional dyspnoea and peripheral oedema which markedly increased within a two-week period. Auscultation revealed a 4/6-5/6 holosystolic and diastolic machinery murmur.Transthoracic and multiplane transoesophageal echocardiography established the diagnosis of a 3 cm aneurysm of the right coronary sinus of Valsalva with clearly demarcated rupture into the right atrium, with a large left to right shunt shown on colour-Doppler echocardiography. These findings were confirmed on cardiac catheterisation. There was no sign of coronary heart disease.At open-heart surgery the aneurysm was resected, the defect closed with an autologous pericardial patch and the tricuspid valve reconstructed. On follow-up examination the result remained excellent and the patient was free of symptoms.In ruptured aneurysm of the coronary sinus of Valsalva, multiplane transoesophageal echocardiography provides exact diagnosis and optimal planning of the operative procedure.
