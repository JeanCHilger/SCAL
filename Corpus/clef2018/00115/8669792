Systemic cholesterol embolism. The authors report two cases of cholesterol embolism and review the literature on this subject. Cholesterol crystal emboli are very serious complication of atheroma, generally situated in the aorta and usually in patients in their sixties. The frequency of cholesterol embolism is 20% in autopsy studies in this population. The embolic process accounts for the polymorphic clinical feature. Clinical signs are always delayed in relation to triggering factors. The symptoms can sometimes simulate a systemic disease. Cutaneous signs are present in 40 to 75% of cases. Acute renal failure is present in 30% of cases. Other signs may also be observed: alteration of the general state, fever, neurological disorders, pain of the lower limbs, myalgia, gastrointestinal haemorrhage or perforation, ischaemic colitis, pancreatitis, mesenteric or coronary angina. A triggering factor is revealed in 80% of cases: aortic surgery, retrograde aortic catheterization, fibrinolysis or oral anticoagulant treatment. The prognosis is poor due to the clinical context, the patient's age and the absence of any specific treatment. The short-term mortality is 60 to 80% according to various series. The best treatment is prevention: carefully assess the indication for an endovascular procedure in an atheromatous patient if necessary, perform transoesophageal ultrasonography to evaluate the risk
