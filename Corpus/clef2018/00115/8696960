Risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysms in older adults enrolled in The Cardiovascular Health Study. B-mode ultrasound examinations of the abdominal aorta were performed from 1990 to 1992 to evaluate the prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in a subgroup of the Pittsburgh cohort (656 participants, aged 65 to 90 years) of the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS). In this pilot study, we evaluated various definitions of aneurysm and the reproducibility of the measurements. In year 5 (1992 to 1993) of the CHS, the entire cohort (4741 participants) was examined. AAA was defined as an infrarenal aortic diameter of > or= 3.0 cm, or a ratio of infrarenal to suprarenal diameter of > or= 1.2, or a history of AAA repair. For the entire CHS cohort, prevalence of aneurysms was 9.5% (451/4741) overall, with a prevalence among men of 14.2% (278/1956) and prevalence among women of 6.2% (173/2785). Variables significantly related to AAA were older age male sex
