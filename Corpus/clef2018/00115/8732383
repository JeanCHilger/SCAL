Clinical outcome and echocardiographic findings of native and prosthetic valve endocarditis in the 1990's. Prosthetic valve endocarditis is considered to be associated with a more severe prognosis than native valve endocarditis. Among other factors, inappropriate visualization of vegetations in prosthetic valve endocarditis by transthoracic echocardiography is responsible for this observation. Since the introduction of transoesophageal echocardiography into clinical practice the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the detection of vegetations located on prosthetic valves have been enhanced. Therefore we aimed to determine and compare the prognosis of prosthetic valve endocarditis and native valve endocarditis in the era of this improved diagnostic approach. One hundred and six episodes of infective endocarditis in 104 patients were seen at our institution between 1989 and 1993. Eighty patients (77%) had native valve endocarditis and 24 (23%) had late prosthetic valve endocarditis. In the latter group two patients had recurrent infective endocarditis. Patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis were older (mean age 64 vs 54 years in native valve endocarditis P < 0.001) and the majority was female (62% vs 38% in native valve endocarditis
