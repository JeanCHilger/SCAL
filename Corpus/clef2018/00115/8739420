Postocclusive hyperaemia in skin measured in pigs by laser Doppler: influence of site of arterial stenosis in the limb. To investigate how site and severity of arterial stenosis, and distance between tourniquet and measuring probe influences the postocclusive hyperaemic response in limb skin recorded by laser Doppler.Open study.Nine Norwegian Landrace pigs.Experimental stenoses in the abdominal aorta, the external iliac and femoral arteries. The hyperaemic responses were recorded with the probe at two different distances from the tourniquet.Curve pattern, relative reduction in flux between the two peaks in double humped curves, and time to peak hyperaemic flux.Double humped curves were produced at all sites, but the blood pressure gradient required at the stenosis was greater the more proximal the stenosis. In distal stenoses there was a greater relative reduction in flux between the two peaks (p < 0.05). The time to peak hyperaemic flux was related to the gradient of the stenosis (mmHg) (r = 0.62, p < 0.0001), but was independent of its site. Increased distance between the tourniquet and the probe gave lower laser Doppler amplitudes and prolonged the time to peak hyperaemia in experiments with femoral artery stenosis (p < 0.05).The hyperaemic response is governed by both the severity and the site of arterial stenosis. Stenoses distal to the tourniquet seem to impair the initial reperfusion more than comparable lesions proximal to the tourniquet. Time to reach peak hyperaemia is the single variable most closely related to the severity of the stenosis.
