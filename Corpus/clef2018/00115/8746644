Results of long-term medical treatment of patients with arterial hypertension complicated by aortic dissection. The purpose of the study was to analyse results of ambulatory treatment of patients with arterial hypertension complicated by aortic dissection. Twenty patients (19 men, one woman), aged between 39 and 72 years, underwent full physical examination. In all cases the diagnosis of aortic dissection was confirmed by at least two different imaging methods (ultrasonography, digital subtractional angiography, computer tomography or nuclear magnetic resonance). During follow-up (3-75 months, mean 34.3 months), physical examination was performed every 6-8 weeks, chest radiograph was taken once a year. All patients controlled their blood pressure (BP) at home. According to the mean number of in-home BP measurements per month all patients were divided into two groups: group I good (n = 10) and group II bad compliers (n = 10) (28 +/- 30 vs 3 +/- 2 in-home BP measurements a month). Ten patients (6 in group I, 4 in group II) underwent 24 h automatic BP measurement examination. Blood samples were collected for serum cholesterol and uric acid measurements. All patients suffered from arterial hypertension and in five cases at least one parent suffered from this disease. Only three of 20 have never smoked cigarettes. Elevated serum cholesterol was observed in 10 (50%) cases and elevated uric acid in six (30%). Proximal (type A) aortic dissection (DeBakey classification type I and II) was found in 13 patients, distal aortic dissection (type B) in seven patients. All patients were treated with beta-blockers. In 75% of 20 cases three or more hypotensive drugs were used simultaneously to control BP. In the group I lower values of mean of maximal SBP (160 +/- 10 vs 177 +/- 7 mm Hg, P < 0.05) and lower mean circadian heart rate (58.6 +/- 7.5 vs 80.9 +/- 7.9 beats/min, P < 0.005) were observed. The most frequent complaints were intermittent claudication, 9 (45%) angina pectoris 8 (40%), other chest pain, 4 (20%). During follow-up period (3-75 months, mean 34.3 months) five of 20 patients (25%) died (all had proximal, type A dissection) and 15 of 20 patients (75%) are still alive. All deaths in group II were sudden, whereas the only one in group I was because of chronic renal insufficiency. Mortality rate in the two groups were 10% (one of 10) vs 40% (four of 10), respectively, in groups I and II.patients who control their BP more often have the lower values as well as lower heart rate and therefore a better prognosis.
