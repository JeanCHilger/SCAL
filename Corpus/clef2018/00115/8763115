Heart valve prosthesis from autologous pericardium. Preliminary results apropos of 15 patients. The concept of a heart valve prosthesis made from autologous pericardium is based on the idea of creating and developing a valve with a longer life than heterografts or homografts due to the absence of tissue degeneration causing the deterioration of both of these types of bioprostheses. The first attempts using the fascia lata or the pericardium, implanted in the seventies, were unsuccessful due to problems with pretreatment of the pericardium and other purely technical difficulties. J. Love et al then developed a technique based on Carpentier's earlier work, where a valve is made extemporaneously using the autologous pericardium. We applied this technique in 14 patients from June 1994 to 1995. The mean age of the patients was 68 years (7 males, 7 females). The aortic valve was replaced in all cases. Preoperative findings were: aortic stenosis (n = 7), aortic regurgitation (n = 1), aortic valve disease (n = 6). Two patients also had mitral valve disease and 3 had coronary artery disease. There were no operative deaths and no patients were lost to follow up. Clinical state was satisfactory with a follow-up of 1 to 10 months. Postoperative Doppler echocardiography was performed at 3 and 6 months and showed gradients were very low. This group of patients demonstrated the value and applicability of the concept. The validity of the technique will be evaluated as a function of the long-term results.
