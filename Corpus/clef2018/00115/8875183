Spontaneous obliteration of a pseudo-aneurysm complicating an aortic homograft. Pseudoaneurysm formation after aortic homograft replacement in patients with active endocarditis is a common observation and usually occurs at the site of a former abscess or paravalvular leak in case of prosthetic valve endocarditis. A 53-year-old man with prosthetic endocarditis underwent aortic valve homograft replacement and developed a pseudoaneurysm at the right and noncoronary aortic sinus which was documented by Doppler echocardiography. Follow-up examination ten months after operation unexpectedly revealed a complete obliteration of the previously echo free space between the homograft and the native aortic root and, thus, spontaneous obliteration of the pseudoaneurysm.
