Stenting of stenosis of the abdominal aorta. Isolated abdominal aortic stenosis resulting in bilateral lower limb claudication is uncommon in Asians. We report a 75-year-old Oriental man with isolated abdominal aortic stenosis who underwent intraluminal stenting, resulting in the abolishment of a 76 mmHg gradient. As the stenotic segment was local, only the mid-segment of the Palmaz stent was apposed to the aortic wall. Follow-up ultrasound scans showed that the partially apposed stent was potent, with no thrombosis in the free space between the stent and the wall. Hence, although aortic stenting in this patient resulted in partial apposition of the stent to the aortic wall, there was no thrombosis or migration of the stent. The patient remained symptom-free one year post-stenting. Stenting in this patient with failed balloon angioplasty was a safe and efficacious method of treating significant isolated abdominal aortic stenosis.
