Fate of the excluded abdominal aortic aneurysm sac: long-term follow-up of 831 patients. Nonresective treatment of the infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm by proximal and distal ligation of the aneurysm sac (exclusion) combined with aortic bypass has been previously reported. A 10-year experience with 831 patients undergoing this procedure was reviewed.From 1984 to 1994, 831 (761 elective, 70 urgent) of 1103 patients being treated for abdominal aortic aneurysm underwent repair with the retroperitoneal exclusion technique. Perioperative morbidity and mortality, estimated blood loss, transfusion requirements, natural history of the excluded aneurysm sac, and long-term survival were all assessed.The operative mortality rate for patients undergoing exclusion and bypass was 3.4%. The incidence of nonfatal perioperative complications was 5.2%. Colon ischemia requiring resection occurred in 2 (0.2%) of the 831 patients. Estimated blood loss was 638 +/- 557 cc (50 to 330 cc). On follow-up 17 (2%) patients were found to have patent aneurysm sacs as detected by duplex examination. Fourteen patients required surgical intervention. No cases of graft infection or aortoenteric fistula have been noted.Retroperitoneal exclusion and bypass is a viable alternative to traditional open endoaneurysmorraphy in surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysm. Most excluded aneurysm sacs have thrombosis without any long- or short-term complications however, in a small number of patients delayed rupture of patent aneurysm occurs, thus emphasizing the need for diligent follow-up and appropriate intervention.
