Aortitis and development of an aneurysm after PTA of distal aortic stenosis. A 43-year-old woman was admitted with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAD), pelvis-type. The angiography showed a high-grade stenosis of the aortal bifurcation. A percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in "kissing-balloon-technique" was performed. After 7 days the patient developed a sepsis with distinct back-pain. The ultrasound-B-scan and CT-scan of the abdomen showed the development of an infrarenal aortic aneurysm during a period of 29 days. Bacterial infection of the aorta was considered to be the reason of development of the aneurysm occurred. Immediate antibiotic therapy got the patient afebrile after 14 days. We implanted an aortobiiliacal Dacron graft 2 weeks later. The follow-up time was without complications except for two thrombotic occlusions of the graft after 4 and 19 months. Thrombectomy was carried out in both cases without complications.
