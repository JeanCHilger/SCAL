Hemodynamic evaluation of the Carbomedics R, St Jude Medical HP and Sorin-Bicarbon valve in patients with small aortic annulus. A Doppler echocardiographic study was performed to evaluate the hemodynamic performance of three 19 mm size currently used bileaflet valve prosthesis (St Jude Medical Hydrodinamic Plus, Sorin-Bicarbon and Carbomedic Reduced) implanted in aortic position.Patients, 30, with the same profile receiving 19 mm size valve (ten for each valve type) were selected when body surface area (BSA) was > 1.7 m2. Doppler echocardiography was carried out at rest and after exercise, 60 days after surgery. Peak (Pg) and mean (Mg) gradients across the valve were recorded: the effective orifice area (EOA), and performance index (PI) were calculated.No significant differences were observed between St Jude Medical and Sorin Bicarbon as far as peak and mean gradient, effective orifice area and performance index at rest and after exercise. A significant difference (P < 0.05) was demonstrated in the above mentioned parameters when Carbomedics-R valve were tested. This type of valve showed a lower EOA and PI with higher Pg and Mg gradient both at rest and after exercise.The St Jude Hydrodymanic plus (Hp) and Sorin Bicarbon valves had similar performance and a better hemodynamic trend when compared to the Carbomedics-R valve in patients with large body surface areas. The Carbomedics-R valve shows a ineffective use of the total area of the prosthesis both at rest and after exercise.
