Correlation between aortic transvalvular gradient obtained with Doppler ultrasonography and with hemodynamics study. Role of the underlying etiology. In aortic stenosis, a good correlation was found between the gradients obtained by catheterization and Echo-Doppler. However, the correlation of these two methods in subgroups of patients with different etiologies of aortic stenosis is unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate, whether the correlation between catheterization and Echo-Doppler was similar in patients with different etiologies of aortic stenosis. Patients with concomitant valvular disease were excluded. Only patients with a clearly defined etiology (based on clinical history, echocardiography, angiography and/or pathology) were included in this study. We evaluated 106 patients with aortic stenosis. Forty-nine patients had degenerative aortic stenosis, 32 bicuspid aortic stenosis and 25 rheumatic aortic stenosis. The percentage of male patients in each group were as follows: 57.1% in the denerative aortic group 62.5% in the bicuspid aortic stenosis group
