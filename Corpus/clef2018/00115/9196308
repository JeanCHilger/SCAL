The pulmonary homograft as aortic valve substitute: 7 years' follow up. The advantages of the aortic valve homograft high resistance to infective endocarditis, low risk of thromboembolism, low gradient and excellent long term results are well known. Trying to extend these advantages to a greater number of patients, we used pulmonary homografts as aortic valve substitute, based on the experimental evidence, that they can withstand the higher stress in systemic circulation.From September 1988 to August 1994 175 patients (103 men, 72 women, mean age 61.75 +/- 12.92 years) underwent aortic valve replacement with a cryopreserved pulmonary homograft. All valves were taken from our own homograft bank. They were inserted freehand intraaortically, 162 in subcoronary position, 13 as intraaortic cylinder. All patients were followed clinically and by colorflow Doppler echocardiography in 3-12 month intervals.Patients, 8, died perioperatively (4.57%). None of the deaths was valve related. Patients, 2, had to be reoperated during the perioperative period due to severe valvular incompetence 165 patients were followed up to a period of 7.5 years (mean interval 3.83 +/- 1.45 years). Patients, 30, died, 13 deaths (7.42%) must be regarded as valve related. Patients, 22, (12.52%) had to be reoperated due to severe graft incompetence. Patients, 9 (5.14%), acquired prosthetic endocarditis.Due to our results, high rate of valve related deaths, high rate of graft failure and high rate of prosthetic endocarditis, we must state that the pulmonary homograft did not fulfil our expectations and presently we can not recommend it as an aortic valve substitute.
