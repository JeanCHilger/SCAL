The Indiana pouch: a technic for simple continent urinary diversion. Description of the Indiana pouch, a continent urinary diversion after cystectomy for urogenital tumours, and for the sequelae of neurogenic and traumatic bladders.This was a retrospective study of 16 patients undergoing, between June 1991 and March 1995, cutaneous urinary diversion by ileocaecal graft, detubularized in the colonic segment, with continence ensured by the ileocaecal valve. The postoperative follow-up (4 to 36 months) was performed at 3, 6 and 12 months (abdominal ultrasonography alternating with abdominopelvic CT scan), then annually (CT scan). Finally, a urodynamic assessment was performed in 7 patients.No early complications related to the reservoir were observed. Late complications of the diversion were related to the uretero-colonic anastomosis with 3 dilated renal subunits. Continence was achieved in 12 out of 15 patients, while one patient finally refused self-catheterization. In the patients in whom a urodynamic assessment was performed, the mean capacity of the reservoir was 671.4 +/- 273.9 mL for a filling pressure of between 3.7 +/- 1.6 and 11 +/- 2.5 cm H2O and an ileocaecal valve closure pressure of 97.9 +/- 117.1 cm H2O (full reservoir).The Indiana pouch is a useful urinary diversion as it is simple to perform and is associated with a low revision rate, while ensuring low-pressure continence.
