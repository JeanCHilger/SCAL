Value of Doppler color ultrasonography in diagnosis of arterial occlusive disease of the lower extremity. A direct comparison with percutaneous angiography. A Direct Comparison with Percutaneous Angiography:To compare colour-coded Doppler sonography (CCDS) with conventional angiography in severe occlusive vascular disease of the lower limb.In 55 patients 1141 vessel segments were evaluated, 700 of them with atheromatous plaques, 270 with stenoses, 208 with occlusions and 6 with aneurysms.Deeper-seated vessels such as the abdominal aorta, the pelvic arteries, the superficial femoral artery at the level of the adductor canal and parts of the lower leg arteries are less accessible for direct CCDS. Many pathological changes however can be diagnosed indirectly by changes in the spectral wave form distal to the lesion. In superficial vascular segments (the common femoral artery, the profunda femoris artery, the superficial femoral artery above the adductor canal and the popliteal artery) image quality was excellent, more pathological changes were found, and the degree of stenosis was better estimated in comparison to angiography.The value of CCDS in patients with intermittent claudication is limited to those who have been examined with angiography e.g. before angioplasty, to follow-up examinations after vascular dilatation or surgery and to supplementary visualisation after angiography especially in readily accessible (superficial) vascular segments.
