Instrumental diagnosis for therapeutic decision: intra-arterial DSA versus 3D CT-angiography in abdominal aortic aneurysms. Compared to intraarterial DSA, 3D spiral CT-angiography could be an reliable alternative method for preoperative evaluation and planning of abdominal aortic aneurysms. 3D data reconstruction with new rendering techniques (especially "volume rendering") provides unique information about mural thrombus, calcified plaques, vessel kinking and renal/visceral arteries. However, the more invasive intraarterial DSA should be performed in patients with complex occlusive disease of the iliac arteries, renal or visceral artery stenoses, or pathological findings in peripheral duplex sonography or if intraluminal exclusion with endostent placement is planned.
