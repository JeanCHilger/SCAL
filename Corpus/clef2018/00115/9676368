Surgical therapy of chronic visceral arterial ischemia with aortoceliac, mesenteric patch bypass. Based on two patients suffering from chronic visceral ischemia, the anatomic and pathophysiologic principles prior to surgery are discussed. Antegrade revascularization is supposed to be better hemodynamically. Complete revascularization of multiple arteries seems to be theoretically superior to one-vessel procedures. Within the bypass procedures the aortic-celiac-mesenteric patch bypass could be an excellent surgical possibility combining antegrade with simultaneous revascularization of celiac and superior mesenteric artery.
