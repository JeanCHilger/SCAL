Aortoiliac graft infection as a diagnostic and treatment problem. Aortoiliac graft infection occurs in 2-6% of patients with such prosthesis. This condition is seldom properly diagnosed by conventional radiographic methods, leading to high morbidity and mortality. Clinically, the diagnosis of aortic graft infection is difficult because patients may have a variety of nondescript clinical complaints. The diagnosis of graft infection when associated with minimal or absent clinical signs of low-grade infection is uncertain, but is critically important to avoid frequently catastrophic complications such as sepsis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and suture line disruption.identification of bacterial flora present in aortoiliac graft infection the presentation of my own experience in the detection of aortoiliac graft infection with special description of isotopic study with WBC labeled 99mTc HM-PAO and estimation of the usefulness of this test in comparison with computed tomography, ultrasonography, fistulography and angiography1. In cases of aortoiliac graft infection the most common cultured bacteria are found to be Staphylococcus aureus. If there is additional prosthetic-enteric fistula Escherichia coli is the most common cultured bacteria. 2. In a case there was suspicion of aortoiliac graft infection, proper diagnostic procedures are most important for effective ma
