Medtronic Hall versus St. Jude Medical mechanical aortic valve: downstream turbulences with respect to rotation in pigs. Turbulences downstream of mechanical aortic valves are known to contribute to most valve-related complications such as thrombosis, embolization or damage to blood components. In vitro studies have demonstrated the impact of the orientation of prostheses on transvalvular energy loss. This study evaluates the influence of valve orientation on turbulences in the supravalvular aorta in pigs.A rotation device which could carry a Medtronic Hall (MH) or St. Jude Medical (SJM) aortic valve prosthesis (23 mm) was constructed and implanted into four healthy pigs. Turbulence measurements using pulsed Doppler ultrasonography were carried out 3 cm downstream of the valve, while the prostheses were rotated in 45 degrees steps. Reynold's normal stress values (RNS) were calculated as key markers for turbulent stresses.Turbulences downstream of MH and SJM valves demonstrated a significant change with rotation. The MH valve showed minimum RNSmean values with orientation of the large orifice to the right posterior aortic wall, which is the area of highest velocities during ejection. With this orientation, aortic flow almost complied with physiologic conditions. Increase of turbulence was observed with any other position. The SJM valve revealed significant turbulent flow at any orientation. Minimum RNSmean values were also measured with one orifice facing the right posterior wall of the aorta.With optimum orientation (major orifice facing the right posterior aortic wall) the MH valve matches the aortic flow pattern to near-normal physiology. The flow patterns of the SJM valve are less susceptible to rotation, but cannot attain the optimum RNS values of the MH prosthesis.
