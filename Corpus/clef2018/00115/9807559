Infrarenal aortic stenosis: long-term clinical and hemodynamic results of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. To evaluate the safety and long-term clinical and hemodynamic results of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of the infrarenal aorta.During nearly 10 years, 102 patients with symptomatic infrarenal atherosclerotic aortic stenosis underwent PTA. Follow-up information was available in 92 patients (17 men, 75 women mean age, 51.9 years). Stenosis involved the aortic bifurcation in 18 patients and only the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 74 patients. Technical success was defined as residual stenosis less than 50% or a pressure gradient less than 10 mm Hg after PTA. Clinical patency was defined as the absence or improvement of symptoms after PTA. Hemodynamic patency was defined as a normal Doppler waveform in the common femoral arteries, an ankle-brachial ratio greater than 0.95, or the absence of a thigh-brachial pressure gradient.Technical success was achieved in 78 patients after PTA. After 10 years, primary clinical and hemodynamic patency rates were 72% and 46%, respectively. After a mean follow-up of 51 months, 15 of the 22 symptomatic recurrences were due to aortic restenosis 11 of these were treated with repeated PTA with or without stent placement, and three eventually required aortic surgery. No morbidity was encountered.Infrarenal aortic PTA proved to be safe and provided durable, long-term clinical improvement. In this group of relatively young patients, the clinical patency rate of PTA was equivalent to that of aortic surgery but with less morbidity.
