The stentless Cryolife-O'Brien aortic porcine xenograft: a five-year follow-up. The 5-year follow-up of CryoLife-O'Brien stentless porcine aortic valve xenografts is presented.From August 1991 to August 1996, the valve was used in 366 patients. Patients' ages ranged from 18 to 90 years (mean, 73+/-6 years). Survivors were monitored with Doppler echocardiography before discharge, at 6 months, and then annually by the referring cardiologist. Operative and long-term mortality and morbidity were collected using the Edmunds guidelines for reporting morbidity and mortality after cardiac valvular operations.The study was completed during a 6-month period with a 96.5% follow-up, comprising 999 patient-years for a mean follow-up period of 27 months (range, 3 to 64 months). Operative mortality was 6.5%. Linearized rates per patient-year for complications were as follows: structural valve deterioration (0%) thromboembolism (0.5%)The Cryolife-O'Brien stentless valve has given excellent early hemodynamic and 5-year results.
