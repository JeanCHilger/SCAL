Porcine stentless valve/bovine pericardial conduit for right ventricle to pulmonary artery. We assessed the long-term outcome of a glutaraldehyde-preserved bovine pericardial conduit containing a stentless composite porcine aortic valve.Between November 1985 and May 1995, 33 stentless porcine valves attached to bovine pericardial conduits were used in 33 patients with complex congenital cardiac malformations. These patients required a conduit between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery because of an absent or inadequate pulmonic artery. All patients were approached by midsternotomy. One patient with pulmonic atresia and an interventricular septal defect required left thoracotomy for ligation of collaterals.Of the initial 33 patients, clinical follow-up was performed in 23 discharged patients (70%) for 1.7 to 10.5 years. The echo-Doppler analysis performed in each of the 23 followed patients showed excellent conduit and valve function in all but 4 patients, in whom a valve gradient of 60 mm Hg was noted. There was no tissue structural failure noticed in this study.The SJM Biocor (Belo Horizonte, Brazil) bovine pericardial stentless valved conduit performed well as a substitute for the right ventricle to pulmonary artery connection.
