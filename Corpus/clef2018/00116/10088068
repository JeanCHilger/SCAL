The radial artery in coronary surgery: the midterm clinical and angiographic results and the variation in vasoreactivity over time. To evaluate the mid-term angiographic results of radial artery grafts used for myocardial revascularization.The first 68 consecutive surviving patients who received a radial artery graft proximally anastomosed to the aorta at our institution were restudied in a five-year follow-up (mean 59 +/- 6.5 months) 48 of these patients had already undergone an early angiographic examination. The response of the radial artery to the endovascular infusion of serotonin was evaluated one and five years after surgery and the mid-term status of the radial artery grafts was correlated with the degree of stenosis of the target vessel and with the Ca(++)-channel-blocker therapy.The patency and perfect patency rates of the radial artery five years after the operation were 91.9 and 87.0% respectively. All radial artery grafts that were patent early after surgery remained patent at mid-term follow-up and in seven patients early parietal irregularities disappeared after five years. The early propensity to graft spasm after serotonin challenge decreased markedly at mid-term follow-up. The continued use of Ca(++)-antagonists after the first postoperative year did not affect the status of the radial artery graft, whereas the severity of target-vessel stenosis markedly influenced the angiographic results.The mid-term angiographic results of RA grafts used for myocardial revascularization are excellent. A correct surgical indication is essential, whereas continued therapy with Ca(++)-antagonists after the first year does not influence the mid-term angiographic results.
