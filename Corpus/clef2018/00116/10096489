A new flow model for Doppler ultrasound study of prosthetic heart valves. Steady and pulsatile flow models used to assess the hydrodynamic aspects of prosthetic heart valves are generally made of Plexiglas and Lucite tubing. They often allow continuous-wave and pulsed-wave Doppler ultrasound velocity measurements to be made parallel to the flow, but cannot be used as such for ultrasound scanning of valve inflow and outflow velocities because of ultrasonic reverberation and refraction by the tubing. The aim of the study was to develop a new flow model which allowed ultrasonic scanning of the prosthetic valve flow for three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of color Doppler flow distributions.The flow model, designed with left ventricular and aortic chambers composed of agar gel which mimics the ultrasound characteristics of biological tissues, was developed and tested for comparative in vitro hydrodynamic and Doppler ultrasonic studies of aortic prosthetic valves. An electromagnetic flowmeter and a pressure monitor provided the flow and pressure signals for the hydrodynamic tests. The Doppler ultrasonic evaluation was performed with an Ultramark 9 HDI ultrasound system and a 3D ultrasound imaging system. The model was designed to enable assessment of prosthetic valve performance by pulsed-wave and continuous-wave Doppler velocity measurements, as well as by 3D color Doppler velocity measurements obtained by ultrasonic scanning of the left ventricle or aortic chamber with an ultrasound probe mounted on a motorized translation assembly.The study results showed that this new flow model can provide 3D color Doppler velocity distributions as well as accurate comparisons of hydrodynamic parameters of mechanical and bioprosthetic heart valves derived from Doppler and catheter measurements, both under steady and pulsatile flow conditions.This new flow model can be used to evaluate the usefulness of hydrodynamic parameters for the assessment of prosthetic heart valves using both conventional Doppler echocardiography, as currently used in patients, and 3D color Doppler ultrasonic imaging.
