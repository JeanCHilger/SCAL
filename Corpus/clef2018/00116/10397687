Plasma concentrations of interleukin-6 and abdominal aortic diameter among subjects without aortic dilatation. Previous studies suggest that cytokine-induced tissue inflammation may participate in the pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Serum inflammatory markers may reflect arterial inflammation in asymptomatic phases of the aneurysmal disease. We studied 120 outpatients (62 men age, 65+/-9 years) by ultrasound evaluation of the abdominal aorta to evaluate the association of circulating levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) with abdominal aortic diameter in subjects with normal aortic size. Aortic diameter was measured at the infrarenal level and indexed for body surface area. Seven patients with abdominal aortic dilatation (indexed aortic diameter, >1.3 cm/m2) were also identified. Plasma concentrations of IL-6, serum amyloid A (SAA), C-reactive protein (CRP), total homocysteine, and lipids were measured. Among the 113 subjects without aortic dilatation, indexed aortic diameter was positively associated with serum levels of IL-6 (P<0.01), SAA (P<0.01), and total homocysteine (P=0.01). IL-6 levels increased in a stepwise fashion among dichotomized groups of aortic size (low and high aortic diameters) and peaked in patients with aortic dilatation (2.3+/-1.2 versus 2. 7+/-0.9 versus 3.2+/-0.9 pg/mL, respectively
