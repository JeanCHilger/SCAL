Arterial occlusion of the eye in infectious endocarditis. Infectious endocarditis can lead to embolic arterial retinal occlusions. Which therapy is indicated?A 33-year-old man suddenly became blind in his left eye as the result of a central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). This occurred during high-dosage treatment for infectious endocarditis that had been diagnosed 3 weeks earlier. The echocardiogram showed distinct vegetation and an abscess on the aortic valve. The CRAO together with the ultrasound findings was considered an absolute indication for surgery of the aortic valve. During this emergency operation, a 2 cm deep abscess cavity was found between the mitral and aortic valves. After removal of the abscess, together with the infected valve, a prosthetic valve was inserted. Following the operation, the patient made an uneventful recovery. The antibiotic treatment was continued for several months. The left eye remained sightless. No recurrence of infectious endocarditis occurred during the follow-up of 2 1/4 years. A branch retinal arterial occlusion occurred in the right eye of a 35-year-old man who had suffered from chronic infectious endocarditis for several months. Insufficiency of more than one valve had been diagnosed on several occasions. The patient, a drug-addict, had refused surgical treatment on each occasion. After 3 months, the right eye became completely blind owing to CRAO. Following high-dosage treatment with antibiotics, the infectious endocarditis was healed. The right eye remained blind. One year later the patient died.Retinal arterial occlusion of embolic origin in a patient with infectious endocarditis is an indication for immediate medical and/or surgical treatment. This is of particular importance if there is ultrasound evidence of an abscess in the valve area.
