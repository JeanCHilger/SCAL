Dynamic three-dimensional freehand echocardiography using raw digital ultrasound data. In this paper, we present a new method for simple acquisition of dynamic three-dimensional (3-D) ultrasound data. We used a magnetic position sensor device attached to the ultrasound probe for spatial location of the probe, which was slowly tilted in the transthoracic scanning position. The 3-D data were recorded in 10-20 s, and the analysis was performed on an external PC within 2 min after transferring the raw digital ultrasound data directly from the scanner. The spatial and temporal resolutions of the reconstruction were evaluated, and were superior to video-based 3-D systems. Examples of volume reconstructions with better than 7 ms temporal resolution are given. The raw data with Doppler measurements were used to reconstruct both blood and tissue velocity volumes. The velocity estimates were available for optimal visualization and for quantitative analysis. The freehand data reconstruction accuracy was tested by volume estimation of balloon phantoms, giving high correlation with true volumes. Results show in vivo 3-D reconstruction and visualization of mitral and aortic valve morphology and blood flow, and myocardial tissue velocity. We conclude that it was possible to construct multimodality 3-D data in a limited region of the human heart within one respiration cycle, with reconstruction errors smaller than the resolution of the original ultrasound beam, and with a temporal resolution of up to 150 frames per second.
