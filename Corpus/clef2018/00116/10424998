Brom's three-patch technique for repair of supravalvular aortic stenosis. Case histories of all patients (n = 29) operated on for supravalvular aortic stenosis from 1962 to the present were reviewed to study different techniques and outcomes. The technique of symmetric aortoplasty with 3 patches (1 in each sinus) is described and compared with other methods.Case reports were reviewed and follow-up was completed by contacting the patient's (pediatric) cardiologist. We aimed for a last follow-up visit, including Doppler echocardiographic studies, in a period no more than 12 months earlier than December 1997. Supravalvular aortic stenosis was discrete in 25 and diffuse with involvement of the aortic arch and arch vessels in 4 patients. Additional anomalies were bicuspid aortic valve (n = 5), coarctation (n = 3), ascending aortic aneurysm (n = 1), mitral valve insufficiency (n = 2), pulmonary valvular stenosis (n = 1), and peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis (n = 2). Eleven patients had Williams syndrome and 1 patient had Noonan syndrome. Symmetric aortoplasty with 3 patches (1 in each sinus) was used in 13 patients, whereas other nonsymmetric methods (1, 2, or Y-shaped patches) were used in 16 patients. Mean follow-up was 10.5 years (range: 4 months-36 years).All techniques adequately decreased the pressure gradient. Progression of preoperative aortic valve insufficiency or de novo regurgitation was not observed except in 1 patient in whom the patches inserted were too large.No difference could be demonstrated in outcome for any surgical technique however, reconstruction of the aortic root with autologous pericardial patches in each sinus after transection of the aorta has the advantage of symmetry while restoring the normal aortic root anatomy.
