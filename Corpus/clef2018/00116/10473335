Closure of large percutaneous access sites using the Prostar XL Percutaneous Vascular Surgery device. To report early experience using a vascular closure device following endovascular aortic aneurysmal repair in which large-bore sheaths are used.A 10F Prostar XL Percutaneous Vascular Surgery device is used to deploy sutures around sheath entry sites up to 16F. At the completion of the procedure, the sutures are tied with a sliding knot to ensure adequate hemostasis.Maintaining the minimal invasiveness of the percutaneous approach to aortic endografting reduces patient discomfort and permits earlier ambulation and hospital discharge. Initial success seems to be maintained at 1 month, however, longer follow-up will be required.
