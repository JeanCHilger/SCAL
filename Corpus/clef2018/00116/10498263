The significance and management of the leaking endograft. Endoleak is the persistence of blood flow outside the lumen of an endograft, but within an aneurysm sac or adjacent vessel being treated by the graft. Diagnosis may be difficult, and treatment remains somewhat controversial. The purpose of this article is to discuss the clinical significance and appropriate management of endoleaks within the context of our current understanding of this phenomenon. The diagnosis of an endoleak can be made by conventional angiography, duplex ultrasound, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), and computed tomography (CT) angiography. All of these modalities are effective, although CT angiography may be the most sensitive. Endoleaks can be categorized into 5 classes: (1) perigraft flow around the proximal end of the endograft (2) perigraft flow around the distal end of the endograft
