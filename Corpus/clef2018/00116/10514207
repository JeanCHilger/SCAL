Early and long-term results of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the lower abdominal aorta. The purpose of this study was to determine the early and long-term results of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of atherosclerotic lower abdominal aorta stenosis.This study was performed as a retrospective study. From 1980 to 1997, 46 patients with chronic lower limb ischemia with moderate to severe claudication as the result of isolated infrarenal disease or aortoiliac disease underwent PTA. All patients underwent angiography before and after angioplasty and Doppler ultrasound scan examination with ankle-brachial index determination. No stents were used.The technical success rate was 96% (44 of 46 cases). Thirty-eight patients (83%) immediately showed clinical, hemodynamic, and angiographic improvement. The initial success rate for patients with isolated infrarenal or bifurcation disease was 92%, whereas it was 71% for aortoiliac disease. Among the eight patients with no initial improvement, four had clinical deterioration and two required emergency surgical revascularization. There were no other complications. Fifty-six percent of the patient conditions (95% confidence interval [CI], 38% to 74%) remained clinically improved at the 5-year follow-up examination. Recurrence of symptoms was caused by femoropopliteal disease in most patients. The primary patency rate assumed with maintenance of hemodynamic improvements was 70% (95% CI, 52% to 88%) and 64% (95% CI, 44% to 84%) at 4 and 5 years of follow-up, respectively. The primary patency rate at 4 years for patients with isolated infrarenal or bifurcation disease was 83% (95% CI, 64% to 100%), whereas it was 55% for aortoiliac disease (95% CI, 30% to 80% P =.06) The variables that were statistically predictive of patency failure were poor runoff (P =. 01) and presence of aortoiliac atherosclerotic disease (P =.04).Our results suggest that PTA is an excellent treatment for chronic arterial insufficiency of the lower extremities as the result of isolated atherosclerotic lower abdominal aortic occlusive lesions because of good long-term patency. Aortic PTA for those patients with iliac involvement or with poor runoff gives acceptable results but carries lower patency and clinical success rates.
