A 14-year experience with 6 cm as a criterion for surgical treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm. It remains unclear when to recommend operation for an asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). This study examined a prospective series of patients for whom standard criteria were applied.Some 584 consecutive patients with an AAA of diameter 3 cm or greater detected by ultrasonographic screening have been observed for up to 14 years. Repeat ultrasonographic examinations have been performed at intervals. Surgery was not considered unless the aneurysm measured 6 cm in diameter, expanded at a rate equivalent to at least 1 cm per year, caused the patient symptoms, or an iliac aneurysm was present that required treatment.Operation was performed on 127 patients the majority (80Repeated observation is preferable to surgical intervention until an aortic aneurysm measures 6 cm in diameter, expands by 1 cm per annum or causes symptoms.
