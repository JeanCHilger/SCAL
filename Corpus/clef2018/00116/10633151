Review of arterial vascular ultrasound. Duplex ultrasound (US) is established as having a major role in the assessment of both extracranial carotid disease and lower limb graft surveillance. It is also of considerable value in the assessment of lower limb ischemia when used in conjunction with clinical and pressure measurements, and in the monitoring of abdominal aneurysms. Its many other arterial applications are of interest but are currently less well defined. The impact of power Doppler, contrast agents, harmonic imaging, and 3-dimensional reconstruction techniques is yet to be fully appreciated.
