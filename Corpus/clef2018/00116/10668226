Dynamic three-dimensional reconstruction of the heart by transesophageal echocardiography. To evaluate echocardiography accuracy in performing and obtaining images for dynamical three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction.Three-dimensional (3D) image reconstruction was obtained in 20 consecutive patients who underwent transesophageal echocardiography. A multiplanar 5 MHz transducer was used for 3D reconstruction.Twenty patients were studied consecutively. The following cardiac diseases were present: valvar prostheses--6 (2 mitral, 2 aortic and 2 mitral and aortic) mitral valve prolapse--33D echocardiography using a transesophageal transducer is a feasible technique, which improves detection of anatomical details of cardiac structures, particularly of the mitral valve and atrial septum.
