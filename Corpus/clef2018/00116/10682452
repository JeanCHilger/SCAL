The study on relationship between fetal blood flow velocity waveforms and cord blood gas analyses in normal full term pregnancy. To study the relationship between fetal blood flow velocity waveforms and cord blood gas values in normal full term pregnancy.Fetal umbilical artery (UA) and middle cerebral artery (MCA) and abdominal aorta (AbAo) flow velocity waveforms were measured in 45 full term fetuses 24 hrs before selective cesarean section. Resistance index (RI) and pulse index (PI) were calculated, cord blood samples were obtained from the umbilical artery at cesarean section and blood gas values were measured immediately.(1) UA RI had a significant negative correlation with pH and PO2, and a positive correlation with PCO2. (2) MCA RI had a significant positive correlation with pH and PO2, and a negative correlation with PCO2.A Doppler study of fetal blood flow velocity waveforms would be a useful method in the evaluation of the fetal status in the uterus.
