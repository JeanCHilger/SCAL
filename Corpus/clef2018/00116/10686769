Endovascular treatment of aortic aneurysms of the abdominal aorta with covered stents. Abdominal aortic aneurysms are common in the aging population their surgical treatment is well established and allows good results in specialized centers. Endovascular exclusion of abdominal aortic aneurysms has been shown to be feasible since 1991 and nowadays commercially available bifurcated endografts allow safe exclusion in selected cases. In the last year 22 patients with an aorto-iliac aneurysm received endovascular treatment at our Institution. We included patients with favorable anatomic characteristics (i.e. neck > 15 mm length, and < 28 mm diameter, iliac neck < 12 mm diameter, absence of > 90 degrees iliac or aortic angulation) and, in particular, those with increased surgical risk for systemic pathology (12 patients), or hostile abdomen (9 patients). We employed Vanguard II (Boston Scientific) endovascular grafts introduced through a surgically exposed common femoral artery
