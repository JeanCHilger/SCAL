Acute ischemic hepatic failure resulting from intraaortic balloon pump malposition. We describe a rare intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) vascular complication as a result of malpositioning of the IABP. A 61-year-old man with unstable angina underwent emergency coronary artery bypass grafting soon after the insertion of an IABP. Postoperative hemodynamics were stable, but acute hepatic dysfunction occurred on the second postoperative day. Doppler echography revealed the absence of hepatic arterial flow. The IABP was removed, and arterial flow was immediately restored. Thereafter, the hepatic function recovered rapidly. This is a rare case that demonstrates how IABP can cause mechanical abdominal arterial branch obstruction. Evaluations using Doppler echography are useful in detecting such IABP complications.
