Konno procedure for infective endocarditis involving aortic valve in a small child. The Konno procedure was performed to replace the aortic valve and the sinus of Valsalva in a 1-year-old child with pneumococcal infective endocarditis. A Dacron (C.R. Bard, Haverhill, PA) graft and a 16 AP ATS Medical valve (ATS Medical Inc, Minneapolis, MN) were used. Adequate debridement could be easily performed. Postoperative recovery was uneventful. The procedure, originally developed for a narrow aortic annulus, could be a good option for the treatment of a small child with aortic valve endocarditis.
