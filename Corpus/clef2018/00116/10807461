Comparison of debulking followed by stenting versus stenting alone for saphenous vein graft aortoostial lesions: immediate and one-year clinical outcomes. We compared in-hospital and one-year clinical outcomes in patients undergoing debulking followed by stent implantation versus stenting alone for saphenous vein graft (SVG) aortoostial lesions.Stent implantation in SVG aortoostial lesions may improve procedural and late clinical outcomes. However, the impact of debulking before stenting in this complex lesion subset is unknown.We studied 320 consecutive patients (340 SVG aortoostial lesions) treated with Palmaz-Schatz stents. Debulking with excimer laser or atherectomy was performed in 133 patients (139 lesions) before stenting (group I), while 187 patients (201 lesions) underwent stent implantation without debulking (group II). Procedural success and late clinical outcomes were compared between the groups.Overall procedural success (97.6%) was similar between the groups. Procedural complications were also similar (2.2% for group I and 2.6% for group II). At one-year follow-up, target lesion revascularization (TLR) was 19.4% for group I and 18.2% for group II (p = 0.47). There was no difference in cumulative death or Q wave myocardial infarction between the groups. Overall cardiac event-free survival was similar (69% for group I and 68% for group II). By Cox regression analysis, the independent predictors of late cardiac events were final lumen cross-sectional area (CSA) by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) (p = 0.001) and restenotic lesions (p = 0.01). Similarly, final IVUS lumen CSA (p = 0.0001) and restenotic lesions (p = 0.006) were found to predict TLR at one year.These results suggest that, in most patients with SVG aortoostial lesions, debulking before stent implantation may not be necessary.
