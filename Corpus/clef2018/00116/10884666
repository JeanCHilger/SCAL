Clinical experience with autologous endothelial cell-seeded polytetrafluoroethylene coronary artery bypass grafts. Autologous endothelial cell seeding was used to improve the patency of 4-mm polytetrafluoroethylene vascular prostheses.Since 1995, 14 patients with coronary artery disease received 21 autologous endothelial cell-seeded polytetrafluoroethylene vascular bypass grafts for coronary artery revascularization. The polytetrafluoroethylene grafts were seeded with the endothelial cells in a multiple step procedure, including cell culture techniques before coronary bypass operation. With the use of extracorporal circulation and cardioplegic arrest, a bypass operation was performed by means of conventional surgical techniques.After a mean postoperative follow-up of 27.7 months (range, 7.5-48 months), the graft patency rate is 90.5%. Follow-up angiograms of the aorta-coronary polytetrafluoroethylene bypass grafts showed patent bypasses in all cases except two. Angiograms of all 19 patent endothelial cell-seeded polytetrafluoroethylene bypass grafts showed a smooth luminal borderline without stenotic regions. The percutaneous transluminal angioscopic evaluation showed a glossy white and smooth endoluminal graft surface without any fibrin, platelet, or erythrocyte deposits. Intravascular ultrasonographic examinations confirmed the results.Patency of autologous endothelial cell-seeded 4-mm polytetrafluoroethylene vascular prostheses as coronary artery bypass grafts was much better than that of unseeded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts. Further evaluations and a larger population of patients will prove whether the encouraging patency will last.
