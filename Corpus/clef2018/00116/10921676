Valve-sparing aortic root replacement (remodeling/reimplantation) in acute type A dissection. High reoperation rates after supracommissural tube graft replacement for acute type A dissection due to sinus of Valsalva dilation have been reported. Valve-sparing operations focusing on the replacement of the sinus of Valsalva are an appealing alternative. The applicability of these techniques in acute type A dissection remains debatable and results are limited.From 1992 to 1998, 20 patients with acute type A dissection received a valve-sparing aortic root replacement. Two different types of aortic valve-sparing operations were performed: the remodeling technique in 11 patients and the reimplantation technique in 9 patients. Patients were followed for 26 +/- 18 months. Echocardiographic studies were performed every 6 months.There were 2 early postoperative deaths and no late death, no reoperation, and no thromboembolic events. The latest echocardiographic studies of the 18 survivors showed a competent valve in 12 and a trivial aortic valve insufficiency in 6 patients. The mean aortic valve pressure gradient was 4.3 +/- 1.3 mm Hg.These midterm results support the surgical strategy of valve-sparing aortic root replacement in patients with acute type A dissection.
