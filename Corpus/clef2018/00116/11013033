Transrenal fixation of aortic stent-grafts for the treatment of infrarenal aortic aneurysmal disease. We evaluated our early experience with the transrenal fixation of aortic stent-grafts to determine the efficacy of this procedure and its effects on renal artery patency and hemodynamics.Twenty-eight patients (22 men) had endoluminally placed modular bifurcated stent-grafts with a bare spring structure at the proximal end crossing the origin of both renal arteries no patient with infrarenal fixation was included for analysis. The mean age of the patients was 75 +/- 7 years (range, 58-86 years)No evidence of lobular or sublobular perfusion defects of the renal parenchyma was detected postoperatively. Two patients exhibited postoperative changes in renal artery hemodynamics-one progressing from a 30% diameter reduction to a greater than 60% diameter stenosis at the 12-month follow-up visit and one with a normal renal artery preoperatively having elevated flow velocities indicative of a greater than 60% stenosis at the 1-month visit. Of 19 patients with normal preoperative renal function, only one has had persistently elevated serum creatinine levels.We conclude from this experience that the transrenal placement of open stents is safe and effectively excludes the aneurysm, potentially expanding the availability of this technique to more patients with a short infrarenal aortic neck. Long-term follow-up is essential to determine the overall efficacy of this technique and to identify potential effects on renal artery hemodynamics or kidney function.
