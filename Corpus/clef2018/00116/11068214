Extensible expanded polytetrafluoroethylene vascular grafts for aortoiliac and aortofemoral reconstruction. The operative experience and medium-term outcome achieved with longitudinally extensible ('stretch') expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) bifurcated grafts in patients undergoing aortoiliac or aortofemoral reconstruction for occlusive disease at our institution was reviewed. Between 1991 and 1998, 242 patients received a bifurcated stretch graft. Forty-one patients (17%) required an aortic endarterectomy, and 63 (26%) underwent femoral artery endarterectomy. 228 patients were followed for a mean of 32 months. One patient (0.4%) died perioperatively. The perioperative morbidity included cardiac (3.7%), respiratory (2.5%), and renal (3.3%) complications. Three patients required early reoperation for bleeding. Four (1.7%) grafts thrombosed within 24h of surgery eight additional grafts (3.3%) thrombosed 5-8 months later. There were three postoperative aortic graft infections, one inguinal infection, three inguinal pseudoaneurysms, and one aortic pseudoaneurysm. Ultrasonography during follow-up showed no periprosthetic fluid collections or graft dilatations. The bifurcated ePTFE stretch graft is suitable for aortoiliac and aortofemoral reconstruction, and its physical characteristics may help to reduce graft-related complications.
