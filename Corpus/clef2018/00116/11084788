Surgical considerations of extracardiac total cavopulmonary connection. Extracardiac total cavopulmonary connection has been proposed as a rational alternative to the lateral intra-atrial tunnel for complex congenital cyanotic heart diseases undergoing univentricular repair. In five patients, aged 4 1/2 years to 27 years, an extracardiac lateral conduit was used for total cavopulmonary connection at our Institute. Extracardiac lateral conduits were constructed in all the five patients using polytetrafluoroethylene tube grafts. One child required reoperation because of graft thrombosis and an aortic homograft was used in him on the second occasion. Aortic cross clamp was completely avoided in all including reoperation. The results showed no early or late mortality. One child developed persistent hypoxemia and progressive hepatomegaly. Reoperation on 5th post-operative day revealed graft thrombosis with technically unrestricted anastomosis which was replaced by an aortic homograft. He also required embolectomy for inferior vena cava and hepatic veins thrombosis. Post-operative follow-up (range 3 months to 14 months) revealed all patients in functional class I and in normal sinus rhythm. Doppler echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging and angiocardiography revealed unrestricted anastomoses and unobstructed pulmonary blood flow across the conduit. The technical advantages and haemodynamic benefits of this operation are encouraging. However, the lone incidence of graft thrombosis raises concern about the routine usage of synthetic grafts in extracardiac total pulmonary connection. Other inherent weakness appears to be the lack of growth potential of the synthetic tube.
