Usefulness of transesophageal echocardiographic monitoring to improve the outcome of stent-graft treatment of thoracic aortic aneurysms. The stent-graft procedure is becoming an alternative to surgery for treatment of many diseases of the descending thoracic aorta. This study evaluated the role of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), used in combination with fluoroscopy and angiography, in monitoring the outcome of stent-graft placement. Twenty-two consecutive patients were submitted to stent-graft positioning in the descending aorta for various pathologies (7 patients had type B aortic dissections, 6 had thoracic aneurysms, 2 had thoraco-abdominal aneurysms, and 7 had post-traumatic aortic aneurysms). Before stent-graft deployment, TEE changed the proximal site of stent positioning initially identified by angiography in 33% of patients (5 of 15) with aortic aneurysms because of calcifications or atheromas that could interfere with stent adhesion to the aortic wall and that were not seen on angiography. In 28% of patients (2 of 7) with aortic dissection, TEE showed the guidewire in the false lumen, allowing an immediate repositioning. After stent-graft deployment, color Doppler TEE showed a perigraft leak in 7 patients, whereas angiography detected a perigraft leak in only 2 patients (p = 0.02). In 4 of these patients, further balloon expansions resulted in resolution of the leak. In the remaining 3 patients, additional stent-graft positioning was necessary. Considering the total patient cohort, TEE yielded relevant information, resulting in procedure changes in 59% (13 of 22). In conclusion, TEE provided additional information with respect to angiography in all phases of stent-graft treatment, improving immediate outcome and reducing complications.
