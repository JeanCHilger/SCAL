A novel use of ultrasound in pulseless electrical activity: the diagnosis of an acute abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture. We report a case of a patient who presented to the Emergency Department with pulseless electrical activity. A rapid diagnosis of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm was made by Emergency Medicine bedside ultrasonography. On arrival, the patient was without palpable pulses and bradycardic. Therapy with epinephrine, fluids, and atropine was initiated. A bedside ultrasound was immediately performed and revealed coordinated cardiac motion with empty ventricles. A rapid search for signs of blood loss in the abdomen revealed a large abdominal aortic aneurysm. Pulses were restored with fluid, blood, and epinephrine and surgical intervention was begun within 30 min of patient arrival.
