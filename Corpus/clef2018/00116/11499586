Hemodynamics and early performance of the St. Jude Medical Regent aortic valve prosthesis. The St. Jude Medical (SJM) Regent heart valve is a new bileaflet prosthetic valve modified from the currently marketed SJM mechanical valve, with a modified external profile that results in a larger geometric orifice area without changing the existing design of the pivot mechanism or blood contact surface areas. The aim of the present study was to report the early hemodynamic and clinical results of an on-going multicenter trial investigating the clinical performance of the Regent mechanical aortic valve prosthesis.The early results from 204 patients at 11 centers in North America and Europe who underwent implantation of a Regent mechanical aortic valve prosthesis are described. Clinical status was prospectively recorded, and echocardiography with Doppler performed at hospital discharge, and at two and six months and one year postoperatively.Follow up to date is 109.3 patient-years (average follow up 0.5+/-0.4 years per patient range: 0 to 1.7 years). NYHA class improved for the group, and there were low rates of clinical adverse effects. Echocardiographic mean pressure gradient at six months was 13.8+/-10.3, 7.4+/-4.1, 5.4+/-3.2, 5.2+/-2.8, 3.4+/-2.3 and 3.6 mmHg, respectively, for 19, 21, 23, 25, 27 and 29 mm valvesThe SJM Regent aortic valve has excellent associated hemodynamics with rapid and significant left ventricular mass regression. In all cases of adverse events, rates fell within Objective Performance Criteria guidelines. Long-term clinical assessment is on-going.
