Congenital Valsalva sinus aneurysm opening into the right ventricle. Two operated cases. Congenital sinus of valsalva aneurysm is a rare cardiac lesion. Once the aneurysm has ruptured, a large left-to-right shunt is created. Prognosis is grave unless operative intervention is undertaken. The authors present 2 cases (2 male) of congenital aneurysm of the right sinus of valsalva ruptured into the right ventricle. The first patient (52 years) have a history of strenuous exertion followed by acute precordial pain and dyspnea. The second patient (25 years) was asymptomatic. The diagnostic was made by 2D and color doppler echocardiography. The defect was closed with a patch with good postoperative course. The authors emphasise the possible rupture of the congenital aneurysm of the sinus of valsalva after 50 years of age. Echocardiography is certainly the best method for diagnosing the condition and for following up these patients. The prognosis after surgical repair has usually been satisfactory.
