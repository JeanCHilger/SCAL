Ultrasound duplex as a sole exam for surgical purposes in lower limb arterial obstructive disease. The aim of the research is to value the efficacy of ultrasound duplex as a sole preoperative exam in peripheral Arterial Obstructive Disease (PAOD). Angiography is undoubtedly known as the gold standard, though its risks and complications. In the last decades duplex scanning and its variant, has proven to be an irreplaceable tool in the diagnosis of these disease.We evaluated five previous studies that compare angiography to duplex scanning.Out of 273 cases, 207 (73.8%) had a good correspondence between the two methods besides if we consider each arterial tract duplex reliability is better in distal diseases (159 cases out of 200, 79.5%) than in proximal (48 out of 73.65%) contrasting with an other meta-analytic evaluation made by Koelemay et al. Moreover we wanted to verify our personal experience, by the intention to treat method, if the surgical operation selected for our patients would have been the same based only on pre-operative echo-duplex scanning. After the analysis of about 20 files the research was interrupted because there was a perfect correspondence between the two exam only in three cases, all of them re-operation for graft branches obstruction. The lacks of duplex has been: 1) non identification of important lesions on the aorto-iliac tractThe angiography results the fundamental choice in the treatment of PAOD particularly in the distal tracts. Debatable is the role of echography in aorto-iliac portion, where a number of lesions may be effectively treated by endovascular procedures.
