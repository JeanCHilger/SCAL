Isolated supradiaphragmatic descending thoracic aorta stenosis in a Takayasu's disease: surgical cure. A 21-year-old male patient presented with a typical middle aortic syndrome. Echography disclosed a severe narrowing of the lower thoracic aorta with parietal thickening. The isolated character of the lesion was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging and aortography. The surgical cure was realized by a Dacron bypass between the upper thoracic descending aorta and the juxta-diaphragmatic thoracic aorta. Aortic biopsy confirmed Takayasu's disease. Postoperative course was uneventful with normalized blood pressure. The therapeutic options, surgery versus percutaneous dilatation and stent, are discussed.
