Type-II endoleaks following endovascular AAA repair: preoperative predictors and long-term effects. To determine the significance of persistent type-II endoleaks and whether they can be predicted preoperatively in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA).The charts of all AAA patients treated with the AneuRx stent-graft at a single center from 1996 to 1998 were reviewed. Patients with <12-month follow-up or type-I endoleaks were excluded. The presence or absence of type-II endoleaks was determined from duplex imaging and computed tomographic angiography. Three groups were identified and compared: 16 patients with persistent type-II endoleaks (PE), 14 patients with transient type-II endoleaks (TE), and 16 patients with no endoleak (NE).The groups did not differ with regard to age, preoperative comorbidities, follow-up time, and AAA neck diameter and length. AAA diameters were 57.1 +/- 9.0 mm for NE, 63.4 +/- 11.4 mm for TE, and 55.6 +/- 4.2 mm for PE. The inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) was patent in 5 (31%) NE patients, 6 (43%) TE patients, and 13 (81%) PE patients (p < 0.01). The number of patent lumbar arteries visualized preoperatively was 0.5 +/- 1.0 in NE, 1.3 +/- 0.8 in TE, and 2.4 +/- 0.6 in PE (p < 0.0001). Patent IMAs (RR 0.82, p < 0.01) and >2 lumbar arteries (RR 0.40, p < 0.0001) were identified as independent preoperative risk factors for persistent endoleaks. There were no changes in mean diameter or volume in aneurysms with persistent endoleaks.No adverse clinical events were related to the presence of type-II endoleaks, but there was no decrease in aneurysm size in patients with persistent type-II leaks. Patients with a large, patent IMA, or >2 lumbar arteries on preoperative CT angiography are at higher risk for persistent type-II endoleaks.
