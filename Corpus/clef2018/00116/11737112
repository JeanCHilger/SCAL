Laparoscopic treatment of lymphoceles in patients after renal transplantation. Postoperative lymphoceles after renal transplantation appear in up to 18% of patients, followed by individual indisposition, pain or impaired graft function. Therapeutic options are percutaneous drainage, needle aspiration with sclerosing therapy, or internal surgical drainage by conventional or laparoscopic approach. The laparoscopic procedure offers short hospitalisation time and quick postoperative recovery. From 1993 to 1997, 16 patients underwent laparoscopic fenestration of a post-renal transplant lymphocele, and were presented in a retrospective analysis. Three patients have had previous abdominal surgery. Following preoperative ultrasound and CT scan, 16 patients underwent laparoscopic drainage after drainage and staining of the lymphocele with methylene blue. No conversion was necessary. Mean operation time was 42 min, no intraoperative complications were seen. Oral nutrition and immunosuppression were continued on the day of surgery, and patients were discharged between the 2nd and 5th (median hospital stay 3.3 d) day after surgery. No recurrence was evident in a follow-up time of 15-54 months (median 31.4 months). Renal function remained unchanged in all patients postoperatively.
