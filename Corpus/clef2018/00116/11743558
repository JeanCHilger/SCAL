Simultaneous aortic replacement and renal artery revascularization: the influence of preoperative renal function on early risk and late outcome. We documented the postoperative complication rate and the late results of simultaneous infrarenal aortic replacement and renal artery (RA) revascularization at the Cleveland Clinic and correlated these findings with the preoperative serum creatinine level (S(Cr)) and other baseline risk factors.A retrospective review of hospital charts and outpatient records was supplemented with a telephone canvass and the invitation to return for a complimentary RA duplex scan, when a scan had not been done within the previous year. Data were collected for 73 consecutive patients (mean age, 69 years) who underwent aortic procedures that were combined with the repair of RA stenosis from 1989 to 1997 (mean follow-up, 44 months). The preoperative S(Cr) was 2 mg/dL or lower in 45 patients (group R1 median, 1.5 mg/dL) and was higher than 2 mg/dL in the remaining 28 patients (group R2Forty-seven of the patients in this series had aortic aneurysms, 15 patients had aortoiliac occlusive disease, and 11 patients had both types of lesions. Bilateral RA revascularization was necessary for seven patients in group R1 (15%) and for eight patients in group R2 (29%). Group R2 contained more patients with medically resistant hypertension (57%) than group R1 (29%, P = .019). Although there was no statistically significant difference between the 30-day mortality rates (group R1, 2.2% group R2, 11%), the related in-hospital mortality rate for 15 bilateral RA revascularizations (13%) was nearly twice that of 58 unilateral revascularizations (6.9%). Patients in group R2 were at a higher risk for postoperative dialysis than those in group R1 (36% vs 6.7%, P = .008), and patients in group R2 had longer lengths of stay in the hospital (median, 14 days vs 9 daysThe early postoperative risk of simultaneous aortic/RA procedures appears to be highest in patients who have an elevated S(Cr), bilateral RA stenosis or occlusion, and a comparatively low long-term survival rate. In this particular group, the adjunctive use of endovascular techniques might conceivably reduce the magnitude of the planned surgical procedure and thus enhance the overall outcome.
