Intravascular ultrasound scanning improves long-term patency of iliac lesions treated with balloon angioplasty and primary stenting. Underdeployment of an intravascular stent has been identified as a cause of restenosis or occlusion of a treated arterial lesion. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) has been shown to initially improve the anatomic and clinical stenting. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the use of IVUS increased long-term patency of this intervention.Between March 1992 and October 1995, 71 limbs (52 patients) with symptomatic aortoiliac occlusive disease underwent balloon angioplasty with primary stenting. IVUS and arteriography were used in 49 limbs (36 patients) to evaluate stent deployment. Arteriography alone was used in 22 limbs (16 patients) to evaluate stent deployment. Patients were captured prospectively in a vascular registry and retrospectively reviewed.Mean age of patients treated with IVUS was 61.1 plus minus 9.0 years (range, 38-85) versus 70.0 plus minus 10.1 years (range, 57-87) in patients treated without IVUS (P <.01). There was no difference between the groups with respect to preoperative comorbidities, ankle-brachial indices, or number of stents per limb. Mean follow-up for IVUS patients was 62.1 plus minus 7.3 months (range, 15-81) and 57.9 plus minus 8.7 months (range, 8-80) for patients treated without IVUS (P = not significant). In 40% (20/49) of limbs, IVUS demonstrated inadequate stent deployment at the time of the original procedure. Kaplan-Meier 3- and 6-year primary patency estimates were 100% and 100% in the IVUS group and 82% and 69%, respectively, in limbs treated without IVUS (P <.001). There have been no secondary procedures performed in limbs treated with IVUS and a 23% (5/22) secondary intervention rate in the non-IVUS group (P <.05). Overall Kaplan-Meier survival estimates at 3 and 6 years for all patients were 84% and 67%, respectively.Balloon angioplasty and primary stenting of symptomatic aortoiliac occlusive lesions is a durable treatment option. Long-term follow-up of treated patients shows outcomes that are comparable with direct surgical intervention. IVUS significantly improved the long-term patency of iliac arterial lesions treated with balloon angioplasty and stenting by defining the appropriate angioplasty diameter endpoint and adequacy of stent deployment.
