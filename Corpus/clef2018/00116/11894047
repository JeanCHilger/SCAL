Imaging of endoleaks. The endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms is gaining widespread acceptance worldwide. It relies on the exclusion of the aneurysm sac from arterial pressure/blood flow to reduce the pressure within it and therefore prevent the fatal complication of rupture. The presence of an endoleak is clear evidence that communication between the native circulation and the aneurysm sac persists. Unfortunately, direct measurement of the sac pressure is not a practical or safe method for routine detection or follow-up of endoleaks. Therefore, a fast, safe, sensitive, and reproducible method must be available. Although many imaging modalities have been and continue to be investigated, computed tomography angiography remains the gold standard. This article describes the various modalities used for the detection of endoleaks and discusses their imaging characteristics.
