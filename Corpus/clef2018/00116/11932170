Aortic valve replacement with the Toronto SPV: long-term clinical and hemodynamic results. Long-term durability and hemodynamics of stentless valves are unknown. Therefore, this study was undertaken to evaluate long-term clinical and echocardiographic outcome after aortic valve replacement with the Toronto stentless porcine valve (SPV) bioprosthesis at our institution.Between 1991 and 1998, the Toronto SPV was implanted in 255 patients (mean age, 63+/-11 years, range 22-83 years, 181 males and 74 females). Preoperative diagnoses were aortic stenosis (76%), aortic insufficiency (12%) and mixed lesion (12%). New York Heart Association class III and IV were present in 49% (126/255) of the patients preoperatively. Mean valve size implanted was 26.5+/-2.1mm and in addition 34% (86/255) of the patients had coronary artery bypass surgery.Early mortality was 0.8% (2/255). Actuarial survival at 7 years was 90+/-3%. At 7 years, the freedom from cardiac death was 98+/-2% from valve-related death, 99+/-1%The Toronto SPV has provided excellent clinical and hemodynamic results up until 7 years of follow-up.
