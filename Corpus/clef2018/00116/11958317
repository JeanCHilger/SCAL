Emergent axillary artery stent-graft placement for massive hemorrhage from an avulsed subscapular artery. To report the successful endovascular repair of an acute axillary artery hemorrhage.An 87-year-old woman with Charcot-Marie-Tooth ataxia presented with an enormous shoulder hematoma and clinical signs of exsanguination after a fall. Angiography demonstrated complete avulsion of the right subscapular artery from the axillary artery, and active bleeding into a hematoma of at least 1500 mL. Endovascular repair with a balloon-mounted covered stent-graft was performed percutaneously, which controlled the bleeding and averted surgery. The patient recovered uneventfully and was without signs of recurrent bleeding or ischemia on the 6-month ultrasound examination she reports no symptoms referable to her upper extremity after 14 months.Endovascular repair with stent-grafts is effective in controlling arterial bleeding from supra-aortic vessels even under emergency conditions.
