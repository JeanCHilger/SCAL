Feasibility of the ross procedure: its relationship with the bicuspid aortic valve. The feasibility of the Ross procedure, and which patients benefit most from its performance, have not yet been fully established. The study aim was to analyze the relationship between the etiology of aortic valve disease, the feasibility of performing the Ross procedure, and late pulmonary autograft performance.Between June 1995 and June 2001, 117 patients (77 males, 40 females mean age 37+/-12 years) underwent the Ross procedure at the authors' institution. Of these patients, 53 (45.3%) had severe aortic stenosis, 53 (45.3%) had significant aortic insufficiency, four (3.4%) had active endocarditis, two (1.7%) had subaortic stenosis, and five (4.3%) had prosthesis dysfunction. Eighty-one patients (69%) had a bicuspid aortic valve. Pulmonary autograft dysfunction was defined as regurgitation grade > or =2, as registered by Doppler echocardiography.The Ross procedure was successful in 100 patients (85.5%) hospital mortality was 2.6% (n = 3). The procedure was not feasible in 17 patients (14.5%)The feasibility of performing the Ross procedure is high, unless there is presence of bicuspid aortic valve. Patients with bicuspid aortic valve and a history of aortic insufficiency tend to develop moderate autograft dysfunction during long-term follow up.
