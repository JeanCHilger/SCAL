Eight-year results of aortic root replacement with the freestyle stentless porcine aortic root bioprosthesis. Stentless porcine aortic valves offer several advantages over traditional valves. Among these are superior hemodynamics, laminar flow patterns, lack of need for anticoagulation, and perhaps improved durability.One hundred four patients were operated on from September 17, 1992, to October 31, 1997, as part of a multicenter worldwide investigation of the Medtronic Freestyle stentless porcine bioprosthesis. All patients received a total aortic root replacement. The patients were evaluated postoperatively at discharge, at 3 to 6 months, and yearly by clinical examination and color flow Doppler echocardiography.Operative mortality was 3.9%. No patient experienced structural valve deterioration, nonstructural deterioration, perivalvular leak, or unacceptable hemodynamic performance. At 8 years, survival was 59.8%. Freedom from thromboembolic complications was 83.3%. Freedom from postoperative endocarditis was 96.9%. Freedom from reoperation was 100%. Mean systolic gradients did not change over the time period studied. They were 6.4 +/- 3.8 mm Hg at 1 year and 6.7 +/- 2.6 mm Hg at 8 years. Correspondingly, effective orifice area was 1.9 +/- 0.7 cm2 at 1 year and 1.8 +/- 0.8 cm2 at 8 years. The incidence of any aortic insufficiency also did not change over the length of follow-up. At 1 year, 98% of patients had no or trivial aortic insufficiency and 2% had mild aortic insufficiency. At 8 years, 100% of patients evaluated were free of any aortic insufficiency.The Medtronic Freestyle aortic root bioprosthesis can be used safely to replace the aortic root or aortic valve for aortic valve and aortic root pathology. Total root replacement allows optimal hemodynamic performance with no significant aortic regurgitation. Results up to 8 years show excellent survival and no signs of degeneration. Further follow-up is still needed to determine valve durability.
