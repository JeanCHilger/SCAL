Primary aortoenteric fistula: report of six new cases. Primary aortoenteric fistula (PAEF) is defined as a communication between the native aorta and the gastrointestinal tract, in contrast to secondary fistulas, which arise between a suture line of a vascular graft and the intestine. Arteriosclerosis is the predominant cause of PAEF and accounts for more than two-thirds of the cases reported. The pathogenesis is usually based on direct adhesion of a segment of the gastrointestinal tract to an aortic aneurysm, followed by progressive erosion through the bowel wall. The clinical presentation is usually one of intermittent gastrointestinal haemorrhage resulting in lethal exsanguination. Pain in the abdomen, a pulsatile abdominal mass or fever may be present. The choice of various diagnostic procedures is often decided by the clinical presentation. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy, ultrasound and CT scan may be useful in the evaluation of these patients. Current recommendations for repair include debridement of the aneurysmal aorta, repair with an in situ graft and primary repair of the gastrointestinal tract, followed by aggressive antimicrobial therapy. We present six cases of PAEF surgically treated at the St. Radboud Hospital, the Canisius Wilhelmina Hospital in Nijmegen and the Lukas Hospital in Apeldoorn over a period of 15 years.
