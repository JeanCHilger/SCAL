Stenting of a renal artery compressed by the diaphragm. A 74-year-old man had a resistant hypertension with an increase in plasma aldosterone and active plasma renin levels, and an irregular appearance of the left kidney outline by ultrasound. The CT scan showed a stenosis of the left renal artery, which was pushed against the aorta by the left crus of the diaphragm. An angioplasty with placement of an autoexpansible stent was carried out with a good result on the arterial pressure level. After 3 years, the patient was re-hospitalised with severe hypertension. The CT scan demonstrated a compression of the stent by the left crus of the diaphragm, with good permeability of the artery downstream from the stent, and radiographic examination showed a fracture of the left renal artery stent. Thus, a reimplantation of the left renal artery in the aorta was carried out. Stenosis of the renal artery by fibres from a crus of the diaphragm is a rare cause of renovascular hypertension. Helicoidal angioscanner imaging is particularly useful to do the diagnosis. In the present case, renal angioplasty with stenting was complicated by a fracture of the stent that led to the surgery. Thus, when renal artery stenosis by a crus of the diaphragm is diagnosed, surgical treatment needs to be considered on a case-by-case basis in relation to the anatomy and the biological and functional data.
