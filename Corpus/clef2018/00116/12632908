Comparison of quantitative echocardiographic methods with angiography for assessment of mitral regulation. The aim of this study was to compare echocardiographic assessment of the severity of mitral regurgitation (MR) with angiographic grading.51 patients (patients) with MR (43 men and 8 women), aged from 38 to 75 (mean 56 +/- 9 years), were used in the study. The etiology of MR was: Coronary artery disease (28 pts), infective endocarditis (3 patients), rheumatic disease (5 patients), dilated cardiomyopathy (7 patients), mitral valve prolapse (8 patients).Aortic stenosis and/or aortic insufficiency, mitral stenosis, mechanical prostheses and atrial fibrillation.The mitral regurgitant volume (RV) and effective regurgitant orifice (ERO) were estimated by the proximal convergence method (PISA), regurgitant fraction (RF) and vena contracta width (VCW) by color Doppler quantitative method and compared to the cine ventriculographic grades. The angio-graphic severity of MR was classified as 1 to 4 grades according to the Sellers criteria.There was a good correlation between the angiographic grading and ERO (r = 0.855, p < 0.001), RV (r = 0.868, p < 0.001), RF (r = 0.923, p < 0.001) and VCW (r = 0.846, p < 0.001).1. PISA method is clinically useful in routine evaluation of the severity of MR. 2. VCW provides a simple method for the identification of patients with severe MR. 3. These methods offer an alternative approach in quantifying MR noninvasively.
