Assessment of an aortosaphenous vein graft anastomotic device in coronary surgery: clinical experience and early angiographic results. Until now technologic evolution in coronary bypass surgery has focused on extracorporeal circulation, on operation without extracorporeal circulation, and on the exposure of the operative site. Recently a one-shot anastomotic device for the proximal anastomosis in coronary surgery was developed. We investigated whether the use of the aortic connector system (ACS) could facilitate the creation of aortosaphenous vein graft anastomoses in myocardial revascularization.From November 2000, 40 ACS devices were used in 36 consecutive patients (mean age 70.7 +/- 8.9 years) 12 patients (33.3%) underwent surgery on pump and 24 patients (66.6%) off pumpOf 38 AC (95%) evaluated, 36 (94.7%) functioned properly. The end-to-side proximal anastomosis without aortic clamping is instantaneous, the quality of anastomoses was highly rated, no additional stitches were required, and all coronary arteries could be reached. Intraoperative quantity flow was measured by Doppler analysis and all but one showed good flow. Early postoperative angiography demonstrated good patency of the grafts in all cases but 2 (5.3%). At 1-year follow-up, 1 patient died of stroke all other patients remained free of symptoms and no reoperation was required.The use of ACS makes end-to-side anastomosis rapid, effective, and reproducible while eliminating aortic cross clamping it opens a new era in beating or nonbeating coronary surgery. Long-term results are mandatory to confirm our favorable preliminary results.
