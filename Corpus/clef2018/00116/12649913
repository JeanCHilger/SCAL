Re-dissection of aortic root without gelatin-resorcin-formalin (GRF) glue effect one year after aortic repair. A 58-year-old man, who had undergone emergency graft replacement of ascending and total aortic arch using gelatin-resorcin-formalin (GRF) glue 1 year before, complained of progressive shortness of breath. Ultrasound cardiography revealed severe aortic regurgitation and dissecting aneurysm of aortic root. He underwent composite graft replacement with the aid of the right axillary artery perfusion and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. The redissected brownish intima was identified in the area of noncoronary cusp. There was no special finding in the subsequent histopathological examination. The use of GRF glue for reconstructing the dissected aortic root is associated with a certain amount of risk of aortic wall redissection. Therefore, care should be taken to ensure proper use of GRF glue.
