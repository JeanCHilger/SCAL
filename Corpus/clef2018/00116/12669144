Surgical treatment of celiac artery aneurysm: in situ aortoceliac artery reanastomosis: a case report. The authors present a rare case of celiac artery aneurysm treated by aneurysmectomy and vascular reconstruction, and they review the past literature. A 57-year-old man was referred to their hospital with a complaint of epigastric discomfort. Abdominal echography, 3-dimensional computed tomography, and selective angiography showed a sole celiac artery aneurysm. At operation, the origin of the celiac artery and adjacent aorta was exposed through a midline transperitoneal approach alone. A 25 x 20 x 25 mm fusiform aneurysm of the celiac artery was found 5 mm distal from its origin. Aneurysmectomy and in situ aortoceliac artery reanastomosis was performed buttressed with a doughnut-shaped Teflon felt under the partial clamp of the abdominal aorta. The left gastric artery arising from the aneurysm was ligated. Postoperative angiography showed good patency of the splenic and common hepatic arteries. He had an uneventful postoperative course with no aggravation of the liver function and was discharged 11 days after operation. Pathological examination of the aneurysmal wall revealed medial degeneration with a tear of the internal elastic lamina and intimal edema. In situ aortoceliac artery reanastomosis after aneurysmectomy, as was done in this case, has not been previously documented in the past literature.
