Intrahepatic aneurysmal portohepatic venous shunt: embolization with a tissue adhesive solution. To report the endovascular treatment of an intrahepatic portosystemic venous shunt (IPSVS) using a tissue adhesive solution.A 40-year-old woman without diagnosed liver disease presented for evaluation of vague abdominal pains. A latent portosystemic encephalopathy was diagnosed only during hospitalization, when ultrasound examination disclosed a venous-venous right hepatic communication. The patient was treated with selective percutaneous embolization using a tissue adhesive after blocking the lesion's venous inflow and outflow tracts. The result was excellent, and the patient recovered completely in a few days. After 5 months, the patient is asymptomatic and event-free.Large IPSVS may be successfully treated percutaneously using a tissue adhesive solution, avoiding a more invasive procedure.
