Fate of excluded popliteal artery aneurysms. Popliteal artery aneurysms (PAA) are frequently treated with ligation and exclusion bypass grafting. It is assumed that these aneurysms will shrink and remain asymptomatic. This may not always be true. We sought to elucidate the fate of excluded PAA over time.Data for all PAAs treated with ligation and exclusion bypass grafting between 1986 and 1999 were retrospectively reviewed. Computed tomography (CT) scans and duplex ultrasound scans provided aneurysm patency data and maximal transverse diameter measurements of the popliteal artery during late postoperative follow-up. This information was compared with that from similar preoperative studies.Forty-one patients (39 men, 2 women) underwent 57 ligation and exclusion bypass grafting procedures. Both preoperative and late postoperative (mean, 4.0 years range, 0.43-13.5 years) CT scans or duplex ultrasound scans were available for review of 25 PAAs in 18 patients (ages 42-80 yearsPAA treated with ligation and exclusion bypass grafting often expand and can become symptomatic. This may be analogous to type II endoleak or endotension noted after aortic endovascular repair. We recommend PAA excision or endoaneurysmorrhaphy when feasible.
