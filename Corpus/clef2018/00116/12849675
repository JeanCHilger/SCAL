Prospective echocardiographic diagnosis and surgical repair of anomalous origin of a coronary artery from the opposite sinus with an interarterial course. In this study, we sought to describe the mode of presentation, anatomic features, diagnostic techniques, and surgical outcome in a group of patients with anomalous origin of a coronary artery from the opposite sinus with an interarterial course between the great arteries (AOCA).Anomalous origin of a coronary artery from the opposite sinus with an interarterial course is associated with myocardial ischemia and sudden cardiac death, particularly in adolescents and young adults.The cardiology database at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin was reviewed to identify all patients diagnosed with AOCA.From September 1997 to August 2002, 10 patients were identified with AOCA all were children/adolescents (age range, 3 months to 20 yearsAnomalous origin of a coronary artery from the opposite sinus with an interarterial course is frequently characterized by an intramural course, which can be prospectively identified by TTE. Unroofing the intramural segment without bypass grafting can reliably repair the intramural form of AOCA.
