Abdominal aortic aneurysm manifested by hematemesis in a 32 year old patient infected by HIV. Aortic aneurysm is an uncommon in young patients. The purpose of this report is to describe a case of dissecting aortic aneurysm in a 32-year-old man with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The presenting symptom was recurrent massive hematemesis. Diagnosis was suspected on the basis of clinical cardiovascular assessment and confirmed by ultrasonography and computed tomography. The clinical course was complicated by superior vena cava syndrome and kidney failure. Outcome in the absence of surgical treatment was fatal. Perusal of the literature indicates a rising incidence of large vessel disease in young patients with HIV infection. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms is unclear. Assessment for arterial lesions should be performed in all patients with HIV infection since clinical signs may be misleading. Definitive diagnosis can be achieved by ultrasonography, Doppler ultrasound or computed tomography.
