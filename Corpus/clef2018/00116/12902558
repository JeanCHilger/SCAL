Endovascular aneurysm repair with the Talent stent-graft. Evaluation of the Talent endovascular aortic stent graft in the management of abdominal aortic aneurysms.Thirty-eight patients with suitable abdominal aortic aneurysms were treated over an 18-month period using the modular Talent stent graft. The suprarenal Talent device was deployed in 31 cases. Clinical follow-up of all patients has been performed by clinical examination, contrast-enhanced CT, and Duplex ultrasound for a mean period of 12.5 months.Graft placement was successful in all 38 patients. The immediate exclusion rate was 84%, the 1-month primary exclusion rate was 92.1%, and the 3-month exclusion rate was 97%. There were no deaths in the first 30 days, one death at 3 months due to a presumed rupture, and one other death at 1 year due to carcinomatosis. There have been no migrations or renal complications in the suprarenal group.Our short- and medium-term results are comparable with other published Talent stent-graft series. Suprarenal graft fixation is a safe procedure that may aid in preventing graft migration. Long-term follow-up is required to assess the durability of the suprarenal Talent device.
