Laser Doppler velocimetry measurement of canine mucosal circulation response to bronchial artery reperfusion after lung transplantation. Left lung transplantation accompanied by reestablishment of the circulation of the bronchial arteries by simultaneous transplantation of part of the aorta was performed on seven dogs. Mucosal circulation of the bronchi at the anastomosis was evaluated using laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV). Since the donor lung must maintain blood supply through the bronchial arteries, the donor aorta from its ascending portion to the descending portion below the outlet for the last bronchial artery was retained with the lung graft. The distal end of the left brachiocephalic artery was sutured to the side of the recipient aorta when the blood supply to the bronchial arteries was to be restored. The LDV values before reperfusion of the bronchial arteries were 20 to 65% (mean: 42.8%) of the preoperative value. Since the LDV values increased to 36 to 125% (mean: 79.9%) of the control, blood flow to the bronchial mucosa increased evidently. Four out of seven dogs died one to two days after the operation due to bleeding and operative stress. One dog was sacrificed on the 4th postoperative day and another on the 16th. The last dog died 40 days after surgery. The unfavorable course of the LDV values in these three dogs suggest that the method used does not ensure an adequate blood supply to the bronchial arteries in the long term.
