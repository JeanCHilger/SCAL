Complications in the kidney pelvis and the ureter following kidney transplantation. Development of complications of the pelvis and the ureter, especially obstruction and necrosis with an urinary fistula was seen in 35 of 751 patients after kidney transplantation (4.6%). In this study they occurred significantly often in patients with multiple renal arteries of the donor kidney, for example pole arteries. An arterial angiography of the aorta abdominalis in living donors before transplantation is not be neglected. The diagnosis of urological complications includes sonography, in cases of ureteral obstruction percutaneous antegrade urography, and in a given case computed tomography.
