A prospective study of a hand-held ultrasound device in abdominal aortic aneurysm evaluation. Effective treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) requires both early detection and timely repair to reduce aneurysm-related mortality. The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate the utility of a hand-held ultrasonography (US) device in AAA screening in a Veterans Affairs vascular surgical service.During a 16-month period, patients with risk factors for AAA were evaluated in a blinded fashion with a hand-held US device performed by physicians. A conventional abdominal duplex US examination was also performed by a certified vascular ultrasonographer. Results of the hand-held US was compared with the conventional duplex US examination.A total of 104 patients were evaluated (97 men, mean age 67 +/- 6.3 years). The mean times for hand-held and conventional duplex US examinations were 5.3 +/- 3.2 minutes and 3.1 +/- 2.4 minutes (not significant), respectively. Using the conventional duplex US as a reference, the sensitivity and specificity of the hand-held device in detecting a AAA were 93% and 97%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values of the hand-held device were 89% and 98%, respectively. The likelihood ratios of positive and negative tests of the hand-held US device examination were 82 and 0.14, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of the hand-held US device as compared with the conventional duplex US was 98%.A hand-held portable US device is effective and accurate in AAA screening with results comparable to the conventional abdominal duplex examination. Moreover, hand-held portable US for AAA screening can be performed expeditiously during physical examination. It should be used as an extension in routine physical examination in vascular patients.
