Transient dynamic mid-left ventricular obstruction following aortic valve replacement. The case is presented of dynamic left ventricular mid-cavitary obstruction that complicated the postoperative course following aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting. The condition resolved with appropriate medical management, without further surgical intervention. It is hypothesized that this was due to both concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and direct diastolic ventricular interaction.
