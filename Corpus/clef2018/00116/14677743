Extensive retroperitoneal fibrosis with duodenal and ureteral obstruction associated with giant inflammatory aneurysm of the abdominal aorta. We report a case of abdominal aortic aneurysm complicated by retroperitoneal fibrosis with both duodenal and bilateral ureteral obstruction. The patient underwent successful bilateral transurethral ureteral stenting, and then he was referred for surgical treatment of the aneurysm. Massive retroperitoneal fibrosis was found at surgery, and the mass was removed along with the diseased aorta, which was replaced by a bifurcated Dacron prosthesis duodenolysis and ureterolysis were concomitantly performed. Ureteral stents were removed on the 8th postoperative day. Follow-up assessment at 1 year showed normalization of the urinary tract structure at echography and good hemodynamic performance of the vascular prosthesis at Doppler examination. To our knowledge, no other case of duodenal and bilateral ureteral stenosis secondary to massive retroperitoneal reactive fibrosis in association with abdominal aortic aneurysm has been reported.
