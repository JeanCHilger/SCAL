Genetic approach to the role of cysteine proteases in the expansion of abdominal aortic aneurysms. The elastinolytic cysteine proteases, including cathepsins S and K, are overexpressed at sites of arterial elastin damage. Cystatin C, an inhibitor of these enzymes, is expressed in arterial smooth muscle cells an imbalance in cystatin C has been implicated in the aortic wall degeneration observed in abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of a polymorphism in the signal peptide of the cystatin C gene on the growth of small AAAs.Some 424 patients with a small AAA (4.0-5.5 cm) were monitored for AAA growth by ultrasonography and provided a DNA sample for analysis of the + 148 G > A polymorphism in the cystatin C signal peptide and the-82 G > C polymorphism in the gene promoter. The median length of follow-up was 2.8 years and AAA growth rates were calculated by linear regression analysis.For patients of + 148 GG (n = 263), GA (n = 147) and AA (n = 20) genotypes, the mean(s.d.) AAA growth rates were 0.37(0.29), 0.37(0.23) and 0.30(0.26) cm, and initial diameters were 4.58(0.35), 4.58(0.35) and 4.62(0.36) cm, respectively. Patients of + 148 AA genotype had a slower aneurysm growth rate (unadjusted P = 0.058 after adjustment for age, sex, initial AAA diameter and smoking, P = 0.027). There also was a trend for the rare homozygotes of the-82 C allele to have slower AAA growth (adjusted P = 0.055). Smoking history had a stronger association with aneurysm growth (P = 0.003).There was a weak association between variation in the cystatin C gene and AAA growth. Medical strategies to limit AAA growth might include the inhibition of cysteine proteases.
