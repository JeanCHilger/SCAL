Integrated ultrasound evaluation of dissecting aneurysm of the aorta by the combined use of transesophageal echocardiography and intravascular ultrasound. In order to obtain complete ultrasound imaging of the entire aorta, transesophageal echocardiography and intravascular ultrasound were performed on 3 patients with acute (2 cases) or chronic (1 case) aortic dissection. In each case the integrated use of transesophageal echocardiography and intravascular ultrasound provided an accurate evaluation of the dissection and of its anatomic extension.
