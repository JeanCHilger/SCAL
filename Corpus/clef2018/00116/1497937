Doppler color imaging. Abdomen. Abdominal applications of Doppler ultrasonography are becoming increasingly important as familiarity with Doppler principles and instruments grows. The availability of sensitive duplex and DCI instruments specifically adapted for use in the abdomen and pelvis has stimulated interest in the use of Doppler techniques as a complement to conventional imaging. Although the simultaneous display of tissue and flow information has enhanced the ease of evaluation of vascular abnormalities and increased diagnostic confidence, the role of Doppler is only just beginning to be defined. Since blood flow is a fundamental factor in health and disease, it is hoped that the new information provided by Doppler evaluation of the abdomen will continue to advance the role of ultrasound as a primary diagnostic method as Doppler and color imaging technology mature.
