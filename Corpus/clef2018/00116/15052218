Thromboembolic events after aortic valve replacement in elderly patients with a Carpentier-Edwards Perimount pericardial bioprosthesis. Thromboembolic events after aortic valve replacement with a bioprosthesis were the most frequently occurring complications in elderly patients. Whether this was valve related or dependent on other factors needed further exploration.Five hundred patients with a median age of 73 years were followed retrospectively after aortic valve replacement with a pericardial prosthesis for occurrence of thromboembolism. Of these, 348 also underwent coronary artery bypass grafting. Twenty-five factors were investigated for their potential effect by using univariate and multivariate analysis.Univariate analysis revealed 6 significant factors: preoperative endocarditis (P =.0001), preoperative cerebrovascular accident (P =.002), use of postoperative warfarin sodium (Coumadin, DuPont Merck P =.006), arterial hypertension (P =.023), size of valve prosthesis of 27 mm or larger (P =.023), and hospital thromboembolism (P =.040). There was a trend toward increased fatal thromboembolism in patients without medication. With a multivariate analysis, 4 factors remained significant: preoperative cerebrovascular accident (risk ratio, 4.8Some emboli seemed triggered by the valve prosthesis. A proper anticoagulant protocol but also a treatment of hypertension is important in the prevention of thromboembolism after aortic valve replacement with a bioprosthesis. We did not find a significant role of atrial fibrillation and carotid artery disease.
