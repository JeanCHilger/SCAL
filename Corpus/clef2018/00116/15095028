Emergency stenting to control massive bleeding of injured iliac artery following lumbar disk surgery. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the use of endovascular stenting to repair an iliac artery injury following lumbar discectomy, thus obviating the need for major surgery. A 57-year-old woman developed a distended abdomen and signs of hypovolemic shock immediately following discectomy at the L4-L5 level. Ultrasound showed a large amount of abdominal fluid. Angiography revealed a laceration of the right iliac artery bifurcation with extravasation of contrast material. After occlusion of the internal iliac artery with fibered coils to prevent retrograde flow to the iliac bifurcation, a self-expanding covered stent was inserted to seal the iliac laceration. The leakage of blood stopped immediately. The clinical condition of the patient gradually improved and she was discharged home 5 weeks later. Sealing of arterial laceration as a complication of lumbar disc surgery with a covered stent is a simple and effective alternative to major pelvic surgery.
