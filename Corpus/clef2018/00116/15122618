Incidence and outcome of surgical repair of spigelian hernia. A spigelian hernia develops through a defect present in a locus minoris resistentiae between abdominal muscles. It is generally considered rare but is probably underdiagnosed. This study was undertaken to characterize the history, presenting features and efficacy of surgical correction of spigelian hernia.Medical and surgical charts of 25 patients treated for a spigelian hernia over 22 years were studied retrospectively. Patients were invited for an outpatient interview and physical examination.Dominant symptoms were an intermittent palpable mass (22 patients) and postural pain (16). A quarter of the patients reported a history of other hernias. Two individuals presented with a painful palpable mass and signs of bowel obstruction necessitating emergency small bowel resection. Hernia repair was performed by primary closure in 20 patients and by use of mesh graft in five. During a mean follow-up of 6.1 years, one early recurrence was observed. Two patients reported mild tenderness in the operated area but were not impaired in daily activities.Spigelian hernia is commonly encountered and requires surgical treatment because of the risk of strangulation. Operative treatment is simple and effective in the long term.
