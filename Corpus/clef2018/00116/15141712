Intravascular ultrasound imaging for detection of pseudoaneurysm with aortobronchopulmonary fistula after graft replacement of descending aorta. A 63-year-old man had undergone graft replacement of the descending aorta due to dissection of aortic aneurysm nine years before and closure of an aortobronchopulmonary fistula two years before. He was admitted to our hospital because of massive hemoptysis. Angiography and chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a pseudoaneurysm on the proximal end caused by graft detachment. Intravascular ultrasound clearly revealed half round detachment on both ends of the graft. Replacement of the ascending, arch and distal aorta including the graft was performed, and the patient's postoperative course has been satisfactory. We have concluded that intravascular ultrasound is a useful method for detecting pseudoaneurysm after graft replacement which is not evident on cineangiography, CT or distal subtraction angiography.
