Aortic root homograft in the surgical treatment of aortic valve disease with dilated ascending aorta. Patients with aortic valve disease and a dilated ascending aorta are usually treated with a composite graft comprising a valve and conduit. We review here the results of treatment with an aortic root homograft as a valid alternative.Twenty-two consecutive patients with a mean age of 64.8 (8.8) years were studied. Mean ascending aorta dilation was 54.55 mm, aortic valve insufficiency was present in 16 patients, and a combined lesion was present in 6. In all cases a cryopreserved aortic root homograft was used to replace the aortic valve and ascending aorta. In 9 cases a Dacron conduit was used beyond the sinotubular junction to restore continuity between the homograft and the native aorta.All patients survived surgery. One patient had postoperative systemic inflammatory response syndrome and one patient was re-explored for excessive bleeding. Mean duration of follow-up was 12.1 months (range 2-36 months). No patient was given anticoagulants, and one had an early transient cerebrovascular accident followed by complete recovery. At one month postsurgery the left ventricular systolic (P<.001) and diastolic (P<.009) diameters had decreased significantly on echocardiography, and these decreases persisted throughout follow-up. The caliber of the ascending aorta was normal in all patients (< or =30 mm) except one.Aortic root homografts are a valid alternative in the treatment of aortic valve disease with ascending aorta dilation. The main advantages of this therapy are that permanent anticoagulation is not needed, and that left ventricular dimensions recover rapidly.
