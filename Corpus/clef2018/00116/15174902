Novel intravascular ultrasound-guided method to create transintimal arterial communications: initial experience in peripheral occlusive disease and aortic dissection. To report our experience using a commercially available catheter-based system equipped with an intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) transducer to achieve controlled true lumen re-entry in patients undergoing subintimal angioplasty for chronic total occlusions (CTO) or aortic dissections.During an 8-month period, 10 patients (6 men mean age 73.4 years) with lower extremity (LE) ischemia from CTOs (n=7) or true lumen collapse from aortic dissections (n=3) were treated. Subintimal access and controlled re-entry of the CTOs were performed with a commercially available 6.2-F dual-lumen catheter, which contained an integrated 64-element phased-array IVUS transducer and a deployable 24-G needle through which a guidewire was passed once the target lumen was reached. The occluded segments were balloon dilatedTime to effective re-entry ranged from 6 to 10 minutes (mean 7) in the CTOs antegrade flow was restored in all 7 CTOs, and the patients were free of ischemic symptoms at up to 8-month follow-up. In the aortic dissection cases, the fenestrations equalized pressures between the lumens and restored flow into the compromised vessels. There were no complications related to the use of this device in any of the 10 patients.Our preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of using this catheter-based system for subintimal recanalization with controlled re-entry in CTOs and for aortic flap fenestrations in aortic dissections. This approach can improve the technical success rate, reduce the time of the procedure, and minimize potential complications.
