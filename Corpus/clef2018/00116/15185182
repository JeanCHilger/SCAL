Duplex scanning after endovascular aneurysm repair: an alternative to computed tomography. Late complications following endovascular aneurysm repair indicate the need for long-term surveillance. Clinical trials involving endoluminal stent grafts have typically used computed tomography angiography as the main imaging modality for surveillance. However, computed tomography angiography exposes the patient to higher levels of ionizing radiation, nephrotoxic agents, and increased cost compared to duplex ultrasound. Duplex ultrasound scanning has been widely used for surveillance of abdominal aortic aneurysms for many years. It is well established and the procedure of choice for noninvasive imaging of the aorta. It offers the advantages of easy access, decreased cost, no radiation exposure, and no nephrotoxicity. There is little controversy about duplex scanning for preoperative patient evaluation or surveillance of patients with small aneurysms. However, the use and reliability of duplex scanning in the evaluation and surveillance of patients following endovascular repair is controversial. This article will discuss the benefits, techniques, and limitation of duplex ultrasound in the long-term surveillance of endografts following endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
