Noninvasive intrasac pressure measurement and the influence of type 2 and type 3 endoleaks in an animal model of abdominal aortic aneurysm. The objective of this study was to noninvasively detect pressure changes within an excluded aneurysm sac in an animal model of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and to study the influence of type 2 and 3 endoleaks. A porcine model of AAA that allows for the creation of type 2 and 3 endoleaks was used. A miniaturized pressure monitoring device (3 x 9 x 1.5 mm Remon Medical Technologies, Caesarea, Israel) was implanted within the surgically created and excluded aneurysm sac. The pressure monitoring device is an ultrasound-based system that allows for pressure measurements in a noninvasive, transcutaneous fashion. In addition, catheter-based pressures were taken within the aorta and directly in the AAA sac. Noninvasive measurements were taken in a transcutaneous fashion between the initial operation and the time of sacrifice, when the type 3 endoleak was created (2 weeks). The median mean arterial pressure was 66 mm Hg (range 55-120 mm Hg
