Abdominal aortic surgery and horseshoe kidney. Horseshoe kidney presents a special challenge during surgery of the abdominal aorta. The aim of this study was to evaluate the morbidity and define optimal management based on clinical histories of 15 patients with horseshoe kidney who underwent surgical procedures on the abdominal aorta over a 20-year period. There were 2 female and 13 male patients with an average age of 62.66 (50-75) years. The indications for surgery included aortic aneurysms in 10 patients and aortoiliac occlusive disease in 5. The horseshoe kidney was detected before surgery in 12 patients (80%) by ultrasonography, angiography, computed tomography (CT) or excretory urography. Angiography revealed multiple or anomalous renal arteries in 8 of 12 patients studied preoperatively. At surgery, 10 patients (66.6%) were found to have multiple or anomalous renal arteries. Five patients (33.41%) were without multiple or anomalous renal arteries. Ten required renal revascularization (reimplantation with a Carrel patch in 7 patients and aortorenal bypass in 3). Two patients, both with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms, died postoperatively. In the other 10 cases the average follow-up period was 5.3 years (6 months to 17 years). During this period there were no signs of graft occlusion, renovascular hypertension, or renal failure. From these results we conclude that aortic surgery can be performed safely in patients with horseshoe kidney without increased mortality. These patients require exact preoperative diagnosis (ultrasonography, CT scan, angiography), reimplantation of anomalous renal arteries, and preservation of the renal isthmus.
