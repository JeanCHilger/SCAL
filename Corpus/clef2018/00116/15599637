A case of graft infection 10 years after ascending aorta replacement. A 52-year-old man was admitted with anemia and slight fever, which he had for the last 2 months. He had undergone replacement of the ascending aorta for acute aortic dissection 10 years previously. Echocardiography demonstrated a flailing thin structure in the anterior wall of the ascending aorta corresponding to the proximal portion of the prosthetic graft. This abnormal echocardiographic finding led us to repeat blood cultivation. We finally detected Enterococcus facium and Staphylococcus epidermidis in his blood sample. We diagnosed this as a graft infection and prepared for surgical re-replacement of the infected graft. While he was waiting for the operation, an infectious aneurysm of a tibialis posterior artery ruptured and an emergency operation was done. Replacement of the infected ascending aorta graft was done thereafter. In surgery, 2-cm-long vegetation was found. It stuck to the graft wall near the former hole used for air removal in the first surgery. The patient recovered fully and left our hospital after 3 months of postoperative antibiotics therapy. This rare case of aortic graft infection long after the original replacement surgery suggests the importance of thorough echocardiographic investigation of prosthetic graft infection as a possible cause of fever of unknown origin.
