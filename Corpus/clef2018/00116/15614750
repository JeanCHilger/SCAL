Surveillance for endoleaks: how to detect all of them. Endovascular aneurysm repair has proven to be a valuable alternative to open repair in selected patients. This less invasive procedure, however, requires long-term surveillance for its own set of potential complications, including perigraft leakage, or endoleak. This article focuses on the detection of these leaks, first defining and classifying endoleaks and then describing various means of detecting them, including computed tomographic angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, color-flow duplex ultrasonography, and conventional angiography.
