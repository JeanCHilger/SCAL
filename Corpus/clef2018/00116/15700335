The use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound in large vessels. The introduction of perfluoro-based contrast agents such as SonoVue together with sensitive realtime scanning modes such as cadence contrast pulse sequences (CPS) have made possible significant advances in the management of patients with pathology affecting large vessels. This has been particularly valuable in aortic graft procedures where the lack of nephrotoxicity allows multiple repeat studies for follow-up of leaks. It has also proved valuable in situations where the flow is very slow and undetectable on conventional Doppler
