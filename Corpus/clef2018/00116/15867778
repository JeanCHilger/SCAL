Which biologic valve should we select for the 45- to 65-year-old age group requiring aortic valve replacement? The diversity of biologic valves available to replace the aortic valve renders selection difficult for the 45- to 65-year-old patient. To evaluate and compare the results of biologic valves in the 45- to 65-year-old patient, we reviewed our experience (1991-2004).Three hundred thirty-two patients between 45 and 65 years old with isolated aortic valve disease had a biologic valve implanted: Freestyle valve in 140 patients, a homograft in 54 patients, a stented Mosaic or Perimount valve (stented xenograft) in 62 patients, and a Ross procedure in 76 patients.Perioperative mortality was comparable for all groups (Freestyle, 2.1% homograft, 3.7%Type of aortic biologic valve for the 45- to 65-year-old patient does not affect midterm survival or valve-related morbidity. Thus the choice of biologic valve for the 45- to 65-year-old patient should be dictated by patient-surgeon preference, ease of implantation, and reoperation until longer comparative studies are available.
