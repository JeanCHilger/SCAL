Fundamental study of ultrasonic-measurement-integrated simulation of real blood flow in the aorta. Acquisition of detailed information on the velocity and pressure fields of the blood flow is essential to achieve accurate diagnosis or treatment for serious circulatory diseases such as aortic aneurysms. A possible way to obtain such information is integration of numerical simulation and color Doppler ultrasonography in the framework of a flow observer. This methodology, namely, Ultrasonic-Measurement-Integrated (UMI) Simulation, consists of the following processes. At each time step of numerical simulation, the difference between the measurable output signal and the signal indicated by numerical simulation is evaluated. Feedback signals are generated from the difference, and numerical simulation is updated applying the feedback signal to compensate for the difference. This paper deals with a numerical study on the fundamental characteristics of UMI simulation using a simple two-dimensional model problem for the blood flow in an aorta with an aneurysm. The effect of the number of feedback points and the feedback formula are investigated systematically. It is revealed that the result of UMI simulation in the feedback domain rapidly converges to the standard solution, even with usually inevitable incorrect upstream boundary conditions. Finally, an example of UMI simulation with feedback from real color Doppler measurement also shows a good agreement with measurement.
