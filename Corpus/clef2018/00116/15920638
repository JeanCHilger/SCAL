Applied neuromonitoring and improving CNS outcomes. Despite an overall decrease in perioperative morbidity and mortality, evidence of some degree of central nervous system dysfunction associated with coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery-with or without cardiopulmonary bypass-has steadily mounted. From preoperative studies of CABG patients, it is apparent that over 50% of patients who present for cardiac surgery have evidence of either extracranial or intracranial atherosclerotic disease. Patient-specific factors thus have a fundamental impact on the risks of a brain injury developing after CABG surgery. Cerebral embolization and/or ischemic hypoperfusion are the most likely etiologic mechanisms for perioperative brain injury associated with cardiac surgery, and these factors are closely interrelated. Various monitoring techniques can decrease risk of intraoperative cerebral embolization and hypoperfusion and are associated with improved outcomes. Ultrasound guided aortic instrumentation (epiaortic scanning) can markedly decrease atheroembolic load and risk of stroke. Unrecognized sources of microgaseous emboli, including air entrainment from surgical purse string sutures and perfusionist interventions, can be identified and reduced by transcranial Doppler monitoring. Cerebral hypoperfusion from unrecognized cerebral venous obstruction, inadequate mean arterial pressure, or from hypocapnic cerebral alkalosis can be identified by multimodality neuromonitoring using regional cerebral oxygen saturation and transcranial Doppler. Overall patient outcomes can be improved, and hospital length of stay shortened, by applied neuromonitoring techniques.
