Adjuvant procedures performed during endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm. does it influence outcome? The purpose of this study was to assess whether there is a difference in outcome of endovascular repair in patients with and without intraoperative adjuvant procedures.Demographic, anatomic and operative details were assessed in patients undergoing endovascular repair using the EUROSTAR registry and correlated with morbidity and mortality rates. Three groups of adjuvant procedures: (A) endovascular, (B) surgical peripheral arterial and (C) surgical abdominal arterial were compared with a group of patients without an adjuvant procedure (D). Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards model were used for statistical analysis.Of 4631 endovascular repairs, 1353 patients (29.2%) required adjuvant procedures. Additional endovascular procedures were performed in 1057 (78.1%), surgical peripheral arterial in 193 (14.3%) and surgical abdominal arterial in 103 (7.6%). The 30-day mortality rate was significantly higher in categories with peripheral arterial surgical (6.7%) and abdominal surgical procedures (7.8%) compared to patients without adjuvant procedures (1.5%, p = .001 and p = .004, respectively). Life-table-analysis demonstrated that late mortality, conversion or rupture rates were not increased in patients with an adjuvant procedure.Adjuvant surgical procedures were associated with increased 30-day mortality. Because of this higher risk, endovascular repair should be recommended with caution when surgical adjuvant procedures are anticipated.
