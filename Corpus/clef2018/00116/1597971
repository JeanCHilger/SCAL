The Monostrut Björk-Shiley valve. Seven years' experience. The results of cardiac valve replacement with the Monostrut Björk-Shiley prosthesis (Shiley, Inc., Irvine, Calif.) during a 7-year period are presented. A total of 984 valves were implanted in 820 patients from May 1983 to April 1990. Aortic valve replacement was performed in 378 patients, mitral replacement in 294, and multiple replacement in 148. In addition, 180 patients (22%) underwent associated procedures. Mean age was 52.6 +/- 11 years. Operative (30 days) mortality was 5.9% (49 patients): 3.9% (15 patients) for aortic, 7.8% (23 patients) for mitral, and 7.4% (11 patients) for multiple valve replacement. All patients were given long-term anticoagulation therapy. Follow-up was 99% complete (eight patients were lost to follow-up), with a closing interval of 3 months, and totaled 2422 patient-years. Valve-related complications, expressed as percentage event-free (+/- standard error) at seven years were as follows: structural deterioration, 100% nonstructural dysfunction, 98.3% +/- 0.6%
