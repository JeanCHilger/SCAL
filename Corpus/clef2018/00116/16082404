Aortic aneurysm and dissection: evaluation with spiral CT angiography. The study was undertaken for aortic evaluation and to see its usefulness for assessing aortic aneurysm, aortic dissection and pseudoaneurysm by spiral CT angiography (CTA). A total of 28 patients with aortic aneurysm (n=19), aortic dissection (n=5) and aortic pseudoaneurysm (n=4) were included. CTA findings were compared with ultrasonography in 14, digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in 14, MRI in 9 and surgical findings in 12 patients. CTA was an excellent imaging modality for comprehensive evaluation of aortic aneurysm, dissection and pseudoaneurysm combining the advantage of conventional contrast enhanced CT axial images and those of angiography in the form of 3D reformatted images.
