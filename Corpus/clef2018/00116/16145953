Limitations in ultrasonographic evaluation of the abdominal aortic aneurysms. The frequency of the abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) increases in older population, especially in men older than 50 years. In most cases the AAAs are revealed occasionally in routine ultrasound examination or in CT performed due to other reasons. The aim of the study was the assessment of the diagnostic value and limitations of ultrasound examination in the evaluation of the abdominal aortic aneurysms. The ultrasound examination is a quick, cheap diagnostic modality in revealing the abdominal aortic aneurysm. It may be useful in mass screening, and control of patients with small aneurysm. But ultrasonographic assessment is not accurate enough in the evaluation of all critical features of the aneurysm and preoperative evaluation. In emergency and obese patients the ultrasound examination may fail in visualizing the abdominal aorta. In long aneurysm in ultrasonography the assessment of the involvement of the thoracic aorta is impossible.
