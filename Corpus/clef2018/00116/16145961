Abdominal aortic aneurysm in ultrasound and CT examination. About 75% of AAAs are asymptomatic. They come to light as the chance findings of a lump with or without pulsation, noted on self-examination, a routine physical check-up, or during diagnostic investigations. Ultrasonography and CT are two most often used in diagnosing of AAAs. The aim of the study was the assessment of the diagnostic value of computed tomography and ultrasonography in the evaluation of abdominal aortic aneurysm. Material comprises a group of 26 patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm. There were 18 men and 8 women, aged between 48 and 76 years (mean age 62 years). In each patient computed tomography and ultrasound examinations were performed. Computed tomography is more accurate technique than ultrasonography. In obese patients or in the presence of gas in the bowel the abdominal aorta may be invisible in ultrasonography, but is easily and clearly visualized in CT. Measurements of aneurysm diameters are much more reliable in CT than in ultrasonography. In CT it is possible to imagine and measure the length of the aneurysm in various MPR reconstructions. The bifurcation of the aorta and iliac arteries are well imagined in CT. The coexistent aneurysms of thoracic aorta are easily diagnosed just by performing few additional sections of the thoracic aorta. In properly prepared patients ultrasonography provides good imaging modality in performed screening examination, and in controlling patients with small aneurysm because it is widely accessible and cheap. In preoperative assessment the CT examination is necessary.
