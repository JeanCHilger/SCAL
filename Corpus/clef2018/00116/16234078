Endovascular therapy for stanford type B aortic dissection in 102 cases. To share our experience of 102 cases of endovascular therapy for Stanford type B aortic dissection.Multiple imaging diagnostic modalities were used preoperatively to obtain the anatomical parameters of the aortic dissection. Stent grafts were implanted using digital subtraction angiography and intravascular ultrasound guidance. Follow-up computed tomography angiography 1 week and 1 year postoperatively was used to evaluate treatment efficacy and reveal complications such as endoleak, migration and fracture of the stent graft.Clinical success was achieved in 101 cases (99.0%) one patient (1.0%) died within the perioperative period. Neither postoperative paraplegia nor conversion occurred. Endoleak occurred in 18 cases (17.6%).Endovascular therapy for Stanford type B aortic dissection is less invasive and leads to less severe complications and shorter hospital stay compared with traditional surgery. The short- and mid-term efficacy are persuasive, but further follow-up is required to determine long-term efficacy.
