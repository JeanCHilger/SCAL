Ischemic nephropathy: detection and therapeutic intervention. Although the real prevalence of ischemic nephropathy as a cause of end-stage renal disease is unknown, its incidence has increased in past years. The diagnosis of this pathology requires that a number of functional and anatomic tests be carried out. The initial approach should be to perform duplex Doppler ultrasonography which, besides providing data on the size and extent of the stenosis, enables the intrarenal resistive index to be estimated to determine the pattern of renal parenchyma injury and the expected progression if revascularized. The most frequently used morphologic techniques are magnetic resonance angiography and computer tomography angiography. In the event of ischemic neuropathy, it is necessary to perform a renal arteriography regardless of the inherent risks of contrast toxicity or atheroembolism. Various therapeutic options are reviewed, with emphasis on percutaneous transluminal renal angiography plus stent as the first indication. Even though initial reports were contradictory, several meta-analyses have concluded that better blood pressure control and renal function improvement are achieved with percutaneous transluminal renal angiography plus stent than with conventional medical therapy. Surgical revascularization is preferable in patients with severe aorto-iliac pathology and renal artery ostium complete thrombosis. The risks and benefits of these procedures must be evaluated on an individual basis.
