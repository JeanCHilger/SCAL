Prenatal diagnosis of ventriculocoronary arterial communication in fetuses with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. The purpose of this series was to describe the fetal echocardiographic findings in hypoplastic left heart syndrome with aortic atresia and ventriculocoronary arterial communication and implications of these findings.We describe 2 fetuses with hypoplastic left heart syndrome with ventriculocoronary arterial communication diagnosed at 29 and 20 weeks' gestation, respectively. The underlying cardiac anatomy consisted of a hypoplastic left heart and mitral stenosis with aortic atresia. We used color Doppler and pulsed Doppler sonography on the surface of the myocardium to specifically look for coronary arterial flow.By color Doppler sonography, ventriculocoronary arterial communication was shown between the left ventricular cavity and the left coronary artery with characteristic bidirectional flow on pulsed Doppler examination. There was no mitral regurgitation. The left ventricular myocardium was substantially hypertrophied. The first patient underwent surgical Norwood palliation and died after a prolonged postoperative course. The second patient underwent stenting of the arterial duct and bilateral pulmonary artery banding in the catheterization laboratory but died after a few weeks. Implications of ventriculocoronary arterial communication in association with hypoplastic left heart syndrome are discussed.It is possible to accurately diagnose ventriculocoronary arterial communication on fetal echocardiography. The presence of ventriculocoronary arterial communication is seen exclusively in a subgroup of patients with an aortic atresia and mitral stenosis variant of hypoplastic left heart syndrome. The prognosis is poor in this subgroup of patients.
