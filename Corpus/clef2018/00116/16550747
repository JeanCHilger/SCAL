Microalbuminuria and deterioration of renal function after elective repair of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. Renal dysfunction affects the prognosis of patients after aortic surgery. However, the factors associated with the postoperative deterioration of renal function has not been clarified precisely.We prospectively examined renal function in 80 patients (age: 73 +/- 7 years, 66 males) who required the elective repair of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Serum creatinine (Scr) was measured. 24-h-creatinine clearance (Ccr) and urinary albumin excretion (UAE) were determined. Renal volume and mean renal length were calculated using the data obtained by ultrasonography. 48 patients showed normal UAE (< 30 mg/day), and 24 had microalbuminuria (30-300 mg/day) and 8 had overt proteinuria (> 300 mg/day). Scr were 0.9 +/- 0.4, 1.0 +/- 0.3 and 2.1 +/- 1.3 mg/dl, respectively.On Day 5 after surgery, 12 patients (15%) showed deterioration of renal function as defined either by an increase in Scr (> or = 0.5 mg/dl) or by a decrease in Ccr > or =20%). The acute deterioration of renal function was related to mean renal volume, mean renal length, duration of operation and the use of antibiotics. At Month 12 after surgery, Scr increased in the overt proteinuria group. The deterioration of renal function at Month 12 was found in 8 patients (10%) with microalbuminuria or overt proteinuria, and related to preoperative Ccr, UAE, mean renal volume, mean renal length, smoking status and blood pressure.We conclude that the deterioration of renal function occurred in considerable number of patients with AAA after elective operation on acute and chronic phase, although the development of end-stage renal failure is rare. Factors related to the acute and late deterioration appears to be different. UAE and renal size should be measured, even if Scr is in normal range at preoperative observation.
