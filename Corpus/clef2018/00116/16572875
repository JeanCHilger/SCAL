Ruptured sinus of valsalva aneurysm in a pregnant woman. A ruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm is a rare cardiac anomaly, usually of a congenital nature. There are few documented cases of this condition during pregnancy, which renders unclear the therapeutic options. We report the case of a 35-year-old pregnant woman who presented at the hospital for cardiac evaluation due to the presence of a heart murmur. The patient was asymptomatic and in her 4th month of pregnancy. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a ruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm and a fistula to the right ventricle with evidence of a continuous left-to-right shunt.
