Obstructive anuria secondary to left external iliac artery aneurysm. Case report. To report one case of obstructive anuria due to ureteral compression by an external iliac artery aneurysm in a patient with a single kidney.We report the case of a 76-year-old male with a single kidney presenting at the emergency department with left lumbar pain and anuria for several days. Hydronephrosis of the solitary left kidney due to an aneurysmatic tumor of the external iliac artery was diagnosed after performing various tests (ultrasound, arteriography). Emergency percutaneous nephrostomy was performed with subsequent vascular repair of the aneurysm. The outcome was favourable.Aorto-iliac aneurysm constitutes a rare cause of obstructive anuria. Patients affected are usually males over 50 years of age, smokers, with a history of diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension (AHT), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), etc. Diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms, outstandingly lumboabdominal pain, and the finding of a beating abdominal tumor, as well as signs of a renal failure. Useful complementary studies for diagnosis include ultrasound, intravenous urography (IVU), arteriography and computerised axial tomography (CT). Surgical treatment of the aneurysm generally relieves the obstruction.
