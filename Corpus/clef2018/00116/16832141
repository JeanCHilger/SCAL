Endoscopic ultrasound guided transgastric stenting of traumatic pancreatic pseudocyst. Although there exists multiple modalities of managing traumatic pancreatic pseudocysts it remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. We report herein a case that was successfully managed by endoscopic ultrasound guided transgastric stent placement.A 28-year-old female jockey presented with abdominal pain after being kicked by a horse. Computerised tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed pancreatitis which resolved with conservative treatment. She proceeded to develop a pancreatic pseudocyst demonstrated on a magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatogram. This was managed by transgastric placement of two double pigtail stents into the pseudocyst by endoscopic ultrasound guidance. Rapid recovery followed with the patient remaining well on follow up.EUS guided transgastric stent placement for drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts is recommended particularly if they are in close proximity to the stomach.
