Late results of mesh wound closure after elective open aortic aneurysm repair. Incisional hernia is a common late complication after abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. We examined the outcome after prophylactic placement of a pre-peritoneal polypropylene mesh during abdominal closure in consecutive patients having elective AAA repair.At least 30 months after surgery, 28 patients underwent clinical and ultrasound examination of their surgical wound for incisional hernias. Only one patient had a hernia in the original surgical scar. No patients had late mesh-related wound problems.Pre-peritoneal polypropylene mesh placement is a simple, safe and effective method to decrease the incidence of incisional hernia after AAA repair.
