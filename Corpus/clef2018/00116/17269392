Diagnosis and surgical treatment of false aneurism of proximal anastomosis after performance of aorto-femoral reconstruction for Leriche syndrome. In the clinic there were examined and treated 7 patients, ageing 38-69 years, suffering false aneurism of proximal anastomosis, which occurred after performance of aorto-femoral reconstruction for Leriche syndrome. Besides clinical data, ultrasonographic investigation of aorta was of principal meaning in diagnosis. All the patients were operated on: 2--for an urgent indications because of the prosthesis suppuration and arrosive hemorrhage occurrence and 5--in elective order. The volume of operation have depended on the patient general state, the aneurism etiology, its size and interrelationship with neighboring organs. The aneurism resection with formation of anastomosis and the blood flow restoration have constituted the main kind of operation performed in elective patients. Six patients had recovered and 1 died.
