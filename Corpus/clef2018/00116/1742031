Long-term reproducibility of conventional Doppler analysis in patients with prosthetic valves. Long-term reproducibility of Doppler recordings made by the same investigator using the same ultrasound equipment was determined in 50 clinically stable patients. The mean interval between the first and second examination was 16 +/- 7 months. In 90% of the 33 patients with aortic prostheses, the relative difference between the first and second examination was less than 16% (mean value 9.1%) for the maximum instantaneous gradient and less than 17% (mean value 7.4%) for the mean gradient the relative difference was less than 20% (mean value 8.5%) for the maximum flow velocity in the left ventricular outflow tract and less than 24% (mean value 10.8) for the maximum flow velocity ratio. In 90% of the 25 patients with mitral prostheses, the absolute difference between the first and second examination was less than 3 mmHg for the maximum instantaneous gradient, less than 2.5 mmHg for the mean gradient, and less than 20 msec for the pressure half-time. We conclude that long-term reproducibility of Doppler echocardiographic characteristics of prosthetic valve function is good as far as transprosthetic gradients or pressure half-time are concerned but is less so for maximum flow velocity in the left ventricular outflow tract and the maximum flow velocity ratio. Changes beyond the aforementioned values may represent a real change in prosthetic valve function.
