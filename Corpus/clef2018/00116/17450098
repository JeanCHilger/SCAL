An unusual bile collection after postcholecystectomy bile leakage. Leakage from the cystic duct stumps accounts for the majority of postlaparoscopic cholecystectomy leaks. It commonly presents with a localized bile collection in the gallbladder fossa and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with biliary stenting is a common method of treatment. However, bile may collect in other intra-abdominal locations away from the gallbladder fossa. We present here a case of a patient who developed upper abdominal pain with distension, anorexia, and vomiting a week after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Ultrasonography and computed tomography scans showed an intra-abdominal collection and ERCP showed a cystic duct stump leak. A biliary stent was inserted and the collection was percutaneously drained. His symptoms, however, recurred 2 weeks later, with fever, anorexia, and weight loss. Abdominal computed tomography scan showed 9.3x8.5 cm cystic mass in the left hypochondriac area and ERCP showed persistent leakage from the cystic duct stump. The stent was changed to a larger size Fr12 and the collection was again drained percutaneously. His clinical condition improved dramatically. The biliary stent was removed after 8 weeks and remained well at 9-month follow-up.
