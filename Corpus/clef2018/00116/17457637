Stent angioplasty: an effective alternative in selected infants with critical native aortic coarctation. Management of native aortic coarctation during early months of life poses therapeutic challenges, and there is no consensus among medical professionals regarding a management plan. Much can be argued about the benefits, limitations, and/or complications of transcatheter versus surgical intervention in such cases. Occasionally, the complexity of the lesions limits management options. Therefore, each patient requires individual management decisions because there is no one therapeutic plan that satisfies all patients. In this report, four critically ill infants who had complex native coarctation are presented. Surgical repair was not possible because of relative contraindications. The patients underwent transcatheter stent implantation (six procedures and seven stents) as a nondefinitive procedure with acceptable results. Three patients improved. One patient did not survive, mainly due to other major complications. Multiple reexpansions of the stents were carried out when indicated. After a mean follow-up of 45 months (range, 41-49), the three survivors were doing fine and had gained an average weight of 9.7 kg (range, 6.6-13.3). At the time of reporting, the relative contraindications no longer exist and the final surgical repair can be carried out. Our experience suggests that in certain situations and in critically ill infants with complex form of coarctation, stent angioplasty can be used as a life-saving palliative procedure. Further reexpansions can be done when required. This may serve as a bridge to major surgical repair in the future.
