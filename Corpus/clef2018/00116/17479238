Imaging of aortic disease. Diseases of the aorta are imaged using different modalities according to the cause and clinical situation. Current imaging strategies for the clinically most pertinent aortic diseases are analysed. These disease entities may be differentiated into congenital, acquired and inflammatory diseases. Traumatic and non-traumatic aortic aneurysms and dissections are emphasised in context with endovascular treatment options and subsequent follow-up.
