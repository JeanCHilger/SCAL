Endoleak detection and classification after endovascular treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm: value of CEUS over CTA. This paper focuses on the diagnostic value of CEUS in the detection and characterization of endoleaks in comparison with other imaging modalities, primary CDUS and CTA in the follow-up of endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. CEUS is an interesting alternative technique because of its limited costs and lack of exposure to ionizing radiation. However, CTA cannot currently be substituted because it enables a more precise evaluation of aneurysm morphologic changes, aneurysm sac diameter, graft anchorage and integrity. CEUS could be used along with CTA when the latter reveals the presence of endoleak, to provide a better characterization of it taking advantage of the angiodynamic behavior of the contrast agent that permits an easier visualization of the agent flow into the sac. It could also be indicated when aneurysm diameter increases and CTA did not show sac reperfusion or to monitor type II endoleaks reducing the use of CTA with consequent reduction of costs and exposure to radiation.
