Late color duplex scanning diagnosis of the areas of endovascular intervention into arteries and lower extremity shunts. The purpose of the study was to assess the areas of balloon angioplasty (BAP) and stenting of lower extremity arteries and femoral, popliteal, mainly, in situ autovenous shunts, by using color duplex scanning (CDS) in the late period of a follow-up. Materials and methods. The CDS technique could diagnose 344 (64%) areas of BAP and stenting of lower extremity arteries and shunts. The echosemiotics of complications typical of a late period was determined. Based on the specified echosemiotics of late complications, the author detected 99 (28.8%) cases of hemodynamically significant complications: BAP and stenting area stenosis (n=25 (7.3%)) BAP area restenosis (reocciusion) (n=33 (9.6%))
