Effects of serum levels of novel atherosclerotic risk factors on aortic valve calcification. Aortic valve calcification (AVC) is a common condition that is found predominantly in the elderly. Clinical and histopathologic data prove that AVC is an active, progressive disease involving an atherosclerotic process. The possible role of novel coronary risk factors in the development of AVC were evaluated.A total of 285 consecutive patients (age >60 years) who had been admitted to the authors' cardiology outpatient clinic was enrolled. Each patient underwent two-dimensional Doppler echocardiography. Serum levels of lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)), homocysteine (Hcy), uric acid and C-reactive protein (CRP) were monitored and compared between patients with AVC and subjects with otherwise normal aortic valve morphology.AVC was detected in 112 patients. Compared to controls, patients with AVC were significantly older (73.0 +/- 7.4 versus 68.5 +/- 6.7 years p <0.0001) and, in addition to higher dyslipidemia, had significantly higher serum levels of Lp(a) (27.4 (range: 13.0-47.5) versus 19.9 (range: 10.7-36.1) mg/dlAVC is common in elderly patients admitted to cardiology clinics. In addition to advanced age, high serum levels of Lp(a) and CRP are independent predictors of the condition.
