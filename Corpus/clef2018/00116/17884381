Valve structure and survival in septuagenarians having aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis (+/-aortic regurgitation) with versus without coronary artery bypass grafting at a single US medical center (1993 to 2005). The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of simultaneous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and the influence of valve structure on both early and late survival in septuagenarians having aortic valve replacement (AVR) for aortic stenosis (AS) (with or without aortic regurgitation). We analyzed valve structure in 424 septuagenarians having AVR for AS from 1993 through 2005 at Baylor University Medical Center, including 254 (60%) with and 170 (40%) without simultaneous CABG. Of the 424 patients, 8 (2%) had a congenitally unicuspid aortic valve, 179 (42%), a congenitally bicuspid aortic valve, 235 (55%), a 3-cuspid valve, and in 2 patients (1%) the valve structure was indeterminate. Survival data were available in 418 of the 424 patients: 23 (5.5%) died within 30 days of AVR and 9 other patients from 31 to 60 days after AVR (7.7% 60-day mortality). Sixty-day mortality was not affected by congenital valve abnormality (unicuspid/bicuspid 8.5% vs tricuspid 7.0%). In contrast, late survival (up to 13-year follow-up) was affected by valve structure: it was longer in the unicuspid/bicuspid valve structure group than in the tricuspid valve structure (hazard ratio 0.54, 95% confidence intervals 0.36 to 0.81). The hazard ratio was estimated after adjusting for concomitant CABG. In conclusion, aortic valve structure affected late, but not early survival in septuagenarians undergoing AVR for AS.
