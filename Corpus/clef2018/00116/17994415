The relationship between vascular expansion of the aorta and pulmonary artery and the genesis of the impedance cardiogram using the technique of sonomicrometry. This prospective animal study aims to evaluate the contribution of the pulmonary artery (PA) and aorta on the morphology of the impedance cardiogram using sonomicrometry.Impedance electrodes were placed around the thorax, aorta and in the oesophagus of five dogs. Sonomicrometry crystals were mounted on the PA and aorta for tracking vascular distension while a Doppler flow probe measured aortic blood flow.No significant differences (p > 0.05) were recorded between the onset of aortic expansion, aortic blood flow and the start of the impedance dZ/dt signal. Significant differences (p > 0.001) were recorded between the onset of PA expansion and the dZ/dt signal. PA expansion began 41.6 +/- 6.0 ms, 60.7 +/- 7.2 ms and 42.2 +/- 4.9 ms respectively, before surface, aortic and oesophageal impedance recordings.The genesis of the impedance cardiogram is attributed to volumetric expansion of the aorta.
