Unstented and partial stented bioprostheses for aortic valve replacement--up to 6 years of follow-up. Since January 8, 1985, three different designs of unstented (type A, n = 9) and partial stented (type B, n = 4 and type C, n = 3) glutaraldehyde preserved porcine aortic valves were used for aortic valve replacement in 16 patients with acquired aortic valve lesions. Type A and type B prostheses were implanted using a two suture row technique. In type C prostheses, only a single suture row was necessary for implantation, facilitating surgery considerably. In all patients, the fully flexible commissures of the bioprostheses were secured to the aortic wall of the recipient. There was no hospital mortality. Two patients with type A bioprostheses died due to noncardiac causes, 4 and 24 months postoperatively. One bioprosthesis in this group had to be replaced after 3 months because of insufficiency. Serial Doppler echocardiographic studies were performed up to 6 years after implantation. No significant leaflet calcification was observed. In three type A bioprostheses, a mild insufficiency without progression was recorded. The latest mean/peak transprosthetic pressure gradients were: type A: 6 +/- 4 mmHg/12 +/- 6 mmHg
