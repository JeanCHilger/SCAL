Protection of visceral organs with an aortic occlusion balloon catheter and by femoral perfusion in aortic arch replacement. A 68-year-old man developed hemoptysis. Prominent left 1st arch was pointed out by chest X-p, and enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed 60-mm distal arch aneurysm. Protrusion of the aneurysm strongly suggested aorto-pulmonary fistula. The operation was performed via median sternotomy. Cardiopulmonary bypass was established with the ascending aorta cannulation. During systemic cool down, an aortic occlusion balloon (Equalizer) was inserted in the right femoral artery and its position was monitored by transesophageal echography. Femoral perfusion cannula was inserted in the right femoral artery distal to the site of the Equalizer insertion. When the rectal temperature reached 28 degrees C, Equalizer was inflated and femoral perfusion was started. After the aortic arch was incised, balloon-tipped cannula were inserted into the aortic arch vessels. At this point, separate antegrade cerebral perfusion and lower body perfusion were established. The aortic arch was replaced with woven Dacron tube graft. It took 60 minutes to accomplish distal anastomosis, and urination was 80 ml during this period. Postoperative course was uneventful without renal dysfunction. This method of visceral organ protection seemed to be useful for the patients with impaired renal or liver function and for the patients whose distal anastomosis is difficult.
