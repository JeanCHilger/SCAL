Endovascular stenting for native coarctation of the aorta is an effective alternative to surgical intervention in older children. Assess the early and intermediate results with respect to blood pressure control in older children undergoing endovascular stenting for native coarctation of the aorta.Eleven hypertensive patients (10 +/- 3 years of age) underwent endovascular stenting via standard techniques for native coarctation of the aorta as an alternative to surgical repair. Resting and exercise assessment of blood pressure control with Doppler echocardiography was performed pre- and poststenting.All 11 patients underwent successful stenting without complications and were able to be weaned off antihypertensive medications within a short period of time. At latest follow-up (34 +/- 26 months), all patients are normotensive at rest and during treadmill exercise stress testing. Two patients underwent uncomplicated additional stent dilation at follow-up cardiac catheterization.Endovascular stenting for native coarctation of the aorta in older children is a reasonable alternative to surgical correction. During early follow-up, stenting effectively alleviates the aortic arch obstruction with normalization of the systemic blood pressure both at rest and during maximal exercise.
