Takayasu's arteritis treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with stenting in the descending aorta. A 17-yr-old young woman was referred to our hospital with a 2-yr history of claudication of the lower extremities and severe arterial hypertension. Physical examination revealed significantly different blood pressures between both arms (160/92 and 180/95 mmHg) and legs (92/61 and 82/57 mmHg). The hematological and biochemical values were within their normal ranges, except for the increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (83 mm/hr) and C-reactive protein (6.19 mg/L). On 3-dimensional computed tomographic angiography, the ascending aorta, the aortic arch and its branches, and the thoracic and, descending aorta, but not the renal artery, were shown to be stenotic. The diagnosis of type IIb Takayasu's arteritis was made according to the new angiographic classification of Takayasu's arteritis, Takayasu conference 1994. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with stenting was performed on the thoracic and abdominal aorta. After the interventional procedures, the upper extremity blood pressure improved from 162/101 mmHg to 132/85 mmHg, respectively. She has been free of claudication and there have been no cardiac events during 2-yr of clinical follow-up.
