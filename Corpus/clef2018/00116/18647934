Neoaortoiliac reconstructions using femoropopliteal veins: MDCT angiography findings. In this article, we discuss the neoaortoiliac system procedure, a surgical procedure that uses femoropopliteal vein segments for arterial reconstructions in patients with aortofemoral prosthetic graft infections.CT angiography (CTA) is a powerful imaging tool that can be used in the follow-up of patients after this complex surgery. CTA accurately detects early and late complications that may develop after the neoaortoiliac system procedure.
