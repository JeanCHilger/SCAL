Scheduled preterm delivery for gastroschisis improves postoperative outcome. There are some evidence to suggest that careful antenatal monitoring, scheduled preterm delivery and immediate abdominal wall closure may reduce gastroschisis morbidity. We hypothesised that the advantages of a scheduled preterm delivery balance possible complications related to prematurity. A retrospective study was performed including all cases of gastroschisis born between 1990 and 2004 (n = 69). Cases were categorised in two groups. Group 1 contained gastroschisis cases born between 1990 and 1997. Group 2 contained cases occurring since 1997, when a new management pathway for gastroschisis was established: weekly evaluation of the foetal gut by ultrasound (>28 weeks), corticosteroids, and delivery by scheduled caesarean section at 35 weeks (before if evidence of bowel compromise was present). The primary endpoints of this study were the initiation of oral feeding and the number of re-operation for intestinal obstruction. There was a significantly faster initiation of oral feeding (P < 0.0001), however, duration of parenteral nutrition (34 vs. 38 days) and hospital discharge (53 vs. 58.5 days) was not reduced. There was no complication due to prematurity in group 2. Postoperative outcome was improved with less need for muscular stretching or prosthetic patch and less re-operation for intestinal obstruction (P < 0.05). Scheduled and elective preterm delivery facilitates surgical procedure and shortens the time to first feeding. A delivery at 35 weeks (preferring vaginal delivery) seems to be a good compromise between risks related to prematurity and complications related to intestinal peel.
