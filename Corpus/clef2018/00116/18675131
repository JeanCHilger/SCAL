Renal transplant compartment syndrome: a case report. An unusual case of early double kidney transplant dysfunction due to abdominal compartment syndrome is herein reported. A 62-year-old woman on peritoneal dialysis underwent dual kidney transplantation. The grafts were positioned extraperitoneally in both iliac possae using standard techniques. Surgical procedures and immediate postoperative period were uneventful. The urine output was immediate and the creatinine decreased, but in a few days she developed severe ascites with reduced urine output, increased creatinine, and progressive changes on Doppler ultrasound. The patient underwent paracentesis: the kidney function recovered as well as the Doppler ultrasound. Kidney biopsy was negative for rejection or renal pathology. Graft dysfunction was related to the presence of ascites. A catheter inserted in the abdomen measured intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) of 14 mm Hg. IAP correlated with renal function showing that IAP probably explained renal flow modifications.
