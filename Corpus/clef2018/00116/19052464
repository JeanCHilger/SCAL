Glycerol-preserved arterial allografts evaluated in the infrarenal rat aorta. Vascular transplantation has become an alternative for prosthetic grafts. Suitable storage methods for vascular allografts are therefore necessary. For small caliber arterial allografts, cryopreservation and cold storage showed discouraging results. Since glycerol preservation proved effective for the storage of skin allografts, this preservation method was investigated for vascular allografts using a rat aortic transplantation model.Glycerol-preserved allografts (GA) were transplanted to the infrarenal aorta (n = 18) in Wistar rats. A control group (n = 18) underwent immediate autotransplantation (AU) of an equal length of aorta.Cumulative graft patency at 90 days' follow-up was 93% for AU and 78% for GA (ns). No aneurysm formation was detected in both groups. Intraluminal endothelial cell coverage, integrity of the media and smooth muscle cell repopulation were comparable in both groups. Intimal thickness was less in GA than in AU and inflammatory reaction in the adventitia was diminished in GA.GA were successfully grafted with acceptable patency rates compared to autografts, while intima hyperplasia and adventitial inflammatory reaction were less.
