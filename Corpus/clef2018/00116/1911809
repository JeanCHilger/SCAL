Recycled heart valves from transplant patients. Forty heart transplantations were performed at the Toronto Western Hospital, University of Toronto, from October 1987 to December 1989. Each heart extracted from a recipient was examined with the view of using the aortic valve as a homograft for another patient requiring aortic valve replacement. Of the 40 explanted hearts, 26 had normal aortic valves that were potentially suitable for homografting, and 14 had aortic valves judged as unsuitable. Of the potentially suitable valves, four were preserved for ex vivo arrhythmia studies requiring aortic root perfusion and four were damaged during harvesting. The remaining 18 usable valves were sized at the time of explantation and stored in an antibiotic solution at 4 degrees C. Thirteen valves were transplanted within 10 days of harvesting, and five were discarded because no suitable recipients were available within this period. There were no operative deaths or valve-related complications in the 13 homograft valve recipients. Mean follow-up was 13 months (range, 3 to 27 months). One patient required replacement of the homograft with a mechanical prosthesis because of insufficiency and stenosis. All patients are alive, are New York Heart Association functional class status I, and have insignificant valve gradients based on Doppler echocardiography. Although hearts removed from transplant recipients are severely diseased, the aortic valves are frequently normal and should be considered for use as homografts for other patients requiring aortic valve replacement.
