Role of transesophageal echocardiography in the diagnosis of diseases of the thoracic aorta. The most frequent diseases of thoracic aorta in the adult population, aneurysms and dissection, can lead to dramatic complications. Therefore in these cases an early and careful diagnosis is required for a correct therapeutic choice. The close distance of the thoracic aorta to the esophagus allows a better visualization by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) compared with the transthoracic approach (TTE). Aim of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of TEE versus surgical data in patients with suspected aneurysms and/or dissection of the thoracic aorta. Eighteen patients with aortic aneurysm, confirmed at surgery, underwent B-mode, pulsed Doppler and color echocardiographic examination either by TTE or by TEE. TEE was concordant with surgical findings in all the cases of fusiform (8 patients) and saccular (2 patients) aneurysms, visualizing aortic wall thrombosis in 4 patients. Furthermore TEE, diagnosed all the type I (4 patients) and type III (2 patients) dissection, and 1 type II, identifying in all cases the intimal tear and, in 3 patients, the false lumen thrombosis it demonstrated the presence of severe aortic regurgitation in 3 patients and of mild pericardial effusion in 2 patients. Only in 1 case of type II dissection TEE was not diagnostic because it is not able to visualize completely the aortic arch. In our experience TEE allowed accurate information in patients with aortic aneurysm or dissection. TEE can be considered the first choice diagnostic tool in patients with suspected dissection of the thoracic aorta.
