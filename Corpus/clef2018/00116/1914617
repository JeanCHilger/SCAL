Doppler echocardiography in 180 normally functioning St. Jude Medical aortic valve prostheses. Early and late postoperative assessments. Limited Doppler echocardiographic data are available regarding velocities and gradients across normally functioning St. Jude Medical valves in the aortic position. To establish a standard reference for Doppler characteristics of normal aortic St. Jude Medical prostheses, we recorded continuous-wave Doppler measurements of peak and mean velocities and peak and mean gradients in 180 patients with normally functioning St. Jude aortic valves. There were 119 men and 61 women in the study the mean age was 57 years. Minimal valvular regurgitation was present in 56 patients (31 percent). Velocities and gradients were reported in five patient groups according to valve sizes of 19 mm, 21 mm, 23 mm, 25 mm, and 27 mm
