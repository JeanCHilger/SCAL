Correlation of abdominal fat accumulation and stiffness of the abdominal aorta in obese children. To evaluate abdominal adipose tissue accumulation in obese children by ultrasound measurement and compare with the elastic properties of the abdominal aorta.A total of 56 obese children and a control group of 30 non-obese children had an ultrasound examination for measurements of thickness of visceral, preperitoneal, and subcutaneous fat as well as abdominal aorta stiffness parameters. Anthropometric measurements and metabolic risk profile were assessed by physical examination and blood tests.Abdominal aorta stiffness parameters were all significantly higher in the obese children than in the controls. Among the adipose tissue compartments, visceral fat thickness was the strongest correlate of abdominal aorta stiffness parameters. Similarly, the correlation between visceral abdominal adipose tissue and fasting insulin levels, HOMA score, and pulse pressure also approached significance.This study suggests that abdominal adipose tissue accumulation is closely associated with cardiovascular risk factors in obese children, and among abdominal adipose tissue compartments, visceral fat thickness was strongly correlated with the elastic properties of the abdominal aorta.
