Follow up of endovascular abdominal aortic anevrysm repair with contrast ultrasound. Endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) is a widely accepted treatment for anatomically fitted abdominal aortic aneurysms. The increasing use of this procedure has prompted the need for close surveillance and reliable post-operative imaging. The current tool for assessing EVAR technical success is to perform computed tomography angiography (CTA) in order to exclude endoleaks and to confirm the exclusion of the aneurysm sac. Contrast enhanced ultrasound with low mechanical index is a promising method for follow-up of patients after EVAR. It seems to allow better identification and characterization of endoleaks than unenhanced ultrasound and even than CTA for very low flow endoleaks.
