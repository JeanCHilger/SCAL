Type II endoleaks: when is intervention indicated and what is the index of suspicion for types I or III? One of the principal reasons for failure of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is the occurrence of endoleaks, which regardless of size or type can transmit systemic pressure to the aneurysm sac. There is little debate that type I endoleaks (poor proximal or distal sealing) are associated with continued risk of aneurysm rupture and require treatment. Similarly, with type III endoleak, there is agreement that the defect in the device needs to be addressed however, what to do with type II endoleaks and their effect on long-term outcome are not so clear. Aneurysm sac change is a primary parameter for determining the presence of an endoleak and assessing its impact. While diameter measurement has been the most commonly used method for determining sac changes, volume measurement has now been proven superior for monitoring structural changes in the 3-dimensional sac. Determining the source of an endoleak and the direction of flow are necessary for proper classification
