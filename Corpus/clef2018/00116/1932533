Aortic aneurysms and consumptive coagulopathy. We describe three cases of consumptive coagulopathy caused by extensive thrombus formation in otherwise 'uncomplicated' aortic aneurysms. These cases demonstrate the importance of performing a coagulation screen in any patient presenting with thrombocytopenia who may have an aortic aneurysm. Effective therapy with low-dose heparin was demonstrated with subsequent haemostasis being maintained with warfarin.
