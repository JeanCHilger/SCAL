Results of endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms with an unfavorable proximal neck using large stent-grafts. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the early outcome of endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (EVAR) with an unfavorable neck anatomy using extralarge stent-grafts. We carried out a retrospective review of all patients who underwent elective EVAR using large diameter stent-grafts between June 2006 and February 2008. All patients had computed tomography angiography (CTA) for procedure planning, and detailed assessment of the aneurysm neck was performed using a three-dimensional CTA workstation. All patients were followed up with CTA at 3 and 12 months and annual duplex thereafter when appropriate. This analysis included 25 patients (23 men, 2 woman median age, 76 years
