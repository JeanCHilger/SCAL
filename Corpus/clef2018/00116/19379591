Acute pancreatitis induced by cyclosporine a following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Pancreatitis has not been reported in allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) recipients with cyclosporine in China. This article presented a case of acute pancreatitis in a 49-year-old patient with AML-M2a who received allogeneic stem cell transplant from her HLA identical sister. The preparative regimen consisted of busulfan and cyclophosphamide. The cyclosporine A, short-term methotrexate and antilymphocyte globulin (ATG), were used to prevent the graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Clinical and laboratory signs of acute pancreatitis were found in the patient on day 20 post-transplant. A diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was made although the pancreas was apparently normal at abdominal contrast-enhanced tomography and ultrasonography. She recovered with supportive care and reduction of cyclosporine dose. In conclusion, cyclosporine is the probable cause of pancreatitis in this patient.
