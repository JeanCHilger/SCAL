Late development of splenic artery aneurysm after orthotopic liver transplantation: a case report. Splenic artery aneurysm (SAA) is a rare complication after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Although SAAs are often incidental findings, in some cases they present with signs and symptoms of abdominal mass or intra-abdominal hemorrhage. The diagnosis requires Doppler ultrasound and confirmation with computed tomography, magnetic resonance, or angiography. Endovascular techniques are preferred to surgery for the treatment of most SAAs. A variable interval from 6 days to 11 years has been reported between OLT and the diagnosis of SAA, justifying a lifelong scheduled surveillance of abdominal vessels by ultrasound after OLT. Herein we have reported a case of SAA that developed 16 years after OLT. This pathological condition was totally asymptomatic. Only routine abdominal ultrasound allowed its detection and subsequent successful treatment.
