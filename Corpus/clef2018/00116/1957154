The value of angiodynography in follow-up of surgical vascular prostheses. Apart from the proximal anastomosis, aortoiliac/-femoral bypass is accessible to angiodynography. The spectral waves can mostly be derived and analyzed very well. Femoropopliteal grafts can be demonstrated over the whole length, including the anastomoses if they are not located in the adductor (Hunter's) canal. Pathological findings such as stenosis or aneurysms can be easily detected. Because of a large range of scatter, blood velocity or flow are no suitable parameter to determine functioning and prognosis of the bypass. A triphasic spectral waveform in the graft, the failing of aneurysms, stenosis or turbulent blood flow in the anastomosis, a high "Pulsatility Index" and a short systolic blood flow acceleration distal to the bypass, proved to be more important parameters, that can be easily determined via colour coded Doppler sonography.
