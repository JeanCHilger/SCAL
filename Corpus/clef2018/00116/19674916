Postoperative lipid-lowering therapy and bioprosthesis structural valve deterioration: justification for a randomised trial? Bioprosthesis structural valve deterioration (SVD) is an incompletely understood process involving the accumulation of calcium and lipids. Whether this process could be delayed with lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) is currently unknown. The purpose of this observational study was to evaluate if an association exists between early LLT and a slowing of bioprosthesis SVD, with a view to designing a prospective trial.We followed 1193 patients who underwent aortic valve replacement with contemporary bioprostheses between 1990 and 2006 (mean follow-up 4.5+/-3.1 years, maximum 17.3 years). Of these patients, 150 received LLT (including statins) early after surgery. Prosthetic valve haemodynamics on echocardiography and freedom from re-operation for SVD were compared between patients who did and did not receive postoperative LLT.After bioprosthetic implantation, the progression of peak and mean trans-prosthetic gradients during echocardiographic follow-up (mean 3.3 years) was equivalent between patients treated with and without LLT (peak increase: 0.9+/-7.7 vs 1.1+/-10.9 mmHg, LLT vs no LLT, P=0.87 mean increase: 0.8+/-4.1 vs 0.2+/-5.9 mmHg, LLT vs no LLT, P=0.38). The annualised linear rate of gradient progression following valve replacement was also similar between groups (peak increase per year: 2.0+/-12.1 vs 1.0+/-12.9 mmHg per year, LLT vs no LLT, P=0.52In this observational study, there was no association demonstrated between early postoperative LLT and a slowing of bioprosthesis SVD. With the excellent durability of bioprostheses in the current era, a prospective randomised trial of statin therapy to prevent bioprosthetic SVD does not appear to be justified, let alone feasible.
