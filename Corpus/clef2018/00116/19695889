Clinical results of the Medtronic Mosaic porcine bioprosthesis up to 13 years. The Mosaic bioprosthesis is a third-generation stented porcine bioprosthesis combining physiologic fixation and alpha-amino oleic acid (AOA) antimineralisation treatment to improve haemodynamic performance and durability. This single-centre study reports the clinical results, including haemodynamic performance, of the Mosaic bioprosthesis after implant in aortic or mitral position.Between February 1994 and October 1999, 255 patients with aortic valve replacement (AVR mean age: 67 years, range: 23-82 years) and 47 patients with mitral valve replacement (MVRAfter AVR, mean systolic gradient and effective orifice area at 4, 8 and 13 years follow-up were 13.3+/-5.6, 15.5+/-7.7 and 16.0+/-7.2 mmHg and 1.8+/-0.5, 1.8+/-0.5 and 1.7+/-0.4 cm(2). After MVR, respective data were 4.7+/-2.1, 4.3+/-1.2 and 5.0 mmHg (only one recording) and 2.2+/-0.7, 2.3+/-0.6 and 1.8 cm(2). Transvalvular regurgitation at 13-year follow-up was mild or less in both the AVR and MVR patients. Thirteen-year survival was 63.1+/-4.5% in the AVR group and 51.2+/-13.6% in the MVR group. Early mortality after AVR and MVR was 1.2% and 0.0%, respectively late mortality was 3.2%pt-yr(-1) and 3.3%pt-yr(-1), including a valve-related/unexplained mortality of 1.1%pt-yr(-1) and 0.9%pt-yr(-1). Freedom from adverse events in the AVR and MVR group was permanent neurological event: 97.4+/-1.2% and 96.0+/-3.9%The Mosaic bioprosthesis demonstrates excellent clinical performance and safety after 13 years of follow-up. Continued follow-up will determine whether this new design will provide increased durability.
