Duplex ultrasound scanning (DUS) versus computed tomography angiography (CTA) in the follow-up after EVAR. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is the gold standard follow-up modality after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). A potential alternative noninvasive and less expensive modality is duplex ultrasound scanning (DUS).We studied 314 follow-up paired scans (DUS and CTA) in 59 patients with EVAR.Endoleak--Endoleak was detected in 23.7% patients. The sensitivity and specificity rates of DUS were 54% and 95.3%, respectively. All 9 endoleaks that needed secondary intervention were detected on DUS. Eight of those were identified within a year after EVAR. Sac size--The mean difference in maximum diameter between the DUS and CTA was < or =5 mm in 84.5% of cases and < or =10 mm in 97.1%. Graft patency--There was 100% agreement between CTA and DUS.Duplex ultrasound scanning was reliable as it detected all the leaks that needed reintervention after EVAR. Duplex ultrasound scanning showed similar results to CTA in detecting sac size and patency.
