Late results after surgery of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. From 1981 to 1989, 695 patients with an infrarenal aortic aneurysm underwent surgery. In 114 cases the aneurysm was ruptured. The late results demonstrated, that after successful operation a patient's subsequent course was similar to that after an elective operation. Infarct and insult were the main causes of death in the postoperative period. Sonographic findings complete the postoperation analysis of the patient's later course.
