Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm with electronic clinical reminders. Based on randomized, population-based screening protocols, a single ultrasound examination reduces mortality from an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) by facilitating elective surgical intervention before rupture. Ultrasound screening is accurate, noninvasive, inexpensive, and cost effective. By using a comprehensive electronic medical record, we inquired whether an age-prompted clinical reminder would facilitate the detection of AAA.The AAA risk screen was installed in May 2007 via a computerized patient record system prompt for male veterans ages 65 to 75 who ever smoked. This abbreviated ultrasound examination uses a 3.5- to 4-MHz scan head, measures anteroposterior and transverse planes, and reports the largest infrarenal aortic diameter.Of 1437 examinations there were 73 AAAs of 3.0-cm diameter or larger (5.1%) 33 AAAs of 4.0-cm diameter or larger (2.3%)Recognition of newly diagnosed AAA compared favorably with that of previous screening studies. Electronic clinical reminders identify undiagnosed, life-threatening AAAs before rupture. Immediate counseling is available in the vascular setting.
