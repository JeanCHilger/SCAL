Percutaneous implantation of the CoreValve self-expanding aortic valve prosthesis in patients with severe aortic stenosis: early experience in Spain. The aim of the study was to describe early experience and medium-term follow-up with the CoreValve self-expanding aortic prosthesis at three Spanish hospitals.The study included patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. Other inclusion criteria were: aortic valve area <1 cm(2) (<0.6 cm(2)/m(2)) aortic valve annulus diameter in the range 20-27 mmThe study included 108 patients with a mean age of 78.6 + or - 6.7 years, a mean aortic valve area of 0.63 + or - 0.2 cm(2) and a mean logistic EuroSCORE of 16% + or - 13.9% (range, 2.27%-86.4%). After valve implantation, the maximum echocardiographic transaortic valve gradient decreased from 83.8 + or - 23 to 12.6 + or - 6 mmHg. No patient presented with greater than grade-2 residual aortic regurgitation on angiography. The procedural success rate was 98.1%. No patient died during the procedure. Definitive pacemaker implantation was carried out for atrioventricular block in 38 patients (35.2%). At 30 days, all-cause mortality and the rate of the combined endpoint of death, stroke, myocardial infarction or referral for surgery were 7.4% and 8.3%, respectively. The estimated 1-year survival rate calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method was 82.3% (for a median follow-up period of 7.6 months).Our early experience indicates that percutaneous aortic valve replacement is a safe and practical therapeutic option for patients with severe aortic stenosis who are at a high surgical risk.
