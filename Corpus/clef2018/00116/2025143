Risk factors and early extracoronary atherosclerotic plaques detected by three-site ultrasound imaging in hypercholesterolemic men. Prévention Cardio-vasculaire en Médecine du Travail METRA Group. Ultrasonic detection of atherosclerotic plaque of carotid abdominal aortic and femoral arteries and evaluation of risk factors were performed in 208 hypercholesterolemic men without cardiovascular disease. Twenty-six percent of them had no plaque. Plaque at the carotid, aortic, and femoral sites was found in 37%, 48%, and 53% of subjects, respectively. Plaque was associated (1) in carotid arteries with increased total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (2) in the aorta with increased age, pressure, glycemia, and smoking
