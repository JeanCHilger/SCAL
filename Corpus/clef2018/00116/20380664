Infrapopliteal mycotic aneurysm caused by endocarditis--case report and literature review. Infrapopliteal mycotic aneurysm resulting from endocarditis is rare, with few reported cases in the literature. We describe a case of ruptured mycotic aneurysm involving the infrapopliteal artery in a patient with aortic and mitral endocarditis. Duplex scanning revealed an oval-shaped mass at the infrapopliteal segment, consistent with sacular aneurysm. The aneurysm showed signs of rupture and pseudoaneurysm formation, which was confirmed by angio-MRI and arteriography. The patient was treated by endovascular procedure and remained asymptomatic at the 6-month follow-up.
