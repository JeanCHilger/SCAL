Prognostic value of tissue Doppler-Derived E/e' on early morbid events after cardiac surgery. The tissue Doppler-derived surrogate for left ventricular diastolic pressure, E/e', has been used to prognosticate outcome in a variety of cardiovascular conditions. In this study, we determined the relationship of intraoperative E/e' to the use of inotropic support, duration of mechanical ventilation (MV), length of intensive care unit stay (ICU-LOS), and total hospital stay (H-LOS) in patients requiring cardiac surgery. The records of 245 consecutive patients were retrospectively reviewed to obtain 205 patients who had intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography examinations prior to coronary artery bypass grafting and/or valvular surgery. Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression models were used to analyze the relation between intraoperative E/e' or LVEF and early postoperative morbidity (H-LOS, ICU-LOS, and MV) and the probability that a patient would require inotropic support. With adjustments for other predictors (female gender, hypertension, diabetes, history of myocardial infarction, emergency surgery, renal failure, procedure type, and length of aortic cross-clamp time), an elevated E/e' ratio (>or=8) was significantly associated with an increased ICU-LOS (49 versus 41 median h, P = 0.037) and need for inotropic support (P = 0.002) while baseline LVEF was associated with inotropic support alone (P < 0.0001). These data suggest that the tissue Doppler-derived index of left ventricular diastolic filling pressure may be a useful indicator for predicting early morbid events after cardiac surgery, and may even provide additional information from that of baseline LVEF. Further, patients with elevated preoperative E/e' may need more careful peri- and postoperative management than those patients with E/e' <8.
