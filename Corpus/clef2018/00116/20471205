The ectatic aorta: no benefit in surveillance. To determine if patients presenting with an infrarenal aorta of 25-30 mm in diameter benefit from continued ultrasound surveillance, and if so to identify the frequency required.All patients in the Leicestershire abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening program with an initial AAA diameter of 25-30 mm and who had undergone two or more surveillance scans were identified (345 patients). The primary endpoint was death from AAA rupture, referral for elective repair, or presentation with rupture. This information together with the duration of surveillance was recorded.A total of 345 patients were followed up for mean of 4.25 years (1-11). At 5 years surveillance, there was a 97% freedom from referral for repair or death from rupture.Patients presenting with an AAA diameter 25-30 mm may be safely deferred any further surveillance for a period of 5 years.
