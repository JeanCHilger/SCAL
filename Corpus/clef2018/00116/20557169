Midterm results of the Anson Refix endostapling fixation system for aortic stent-grafts. To report the midterm results of a new vascular endostapling system in the endovascular treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (EVAR).A prospective single-center study was performed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of the Anson Refix Endostapler, which implants a nitinol clip to provide transmural stent-graft fixation to the adventitia. Eight patients (6 men mean age 71 years, range 59-82) underwent EVAR with endostaple fixation between November 2007 and March 2008. Follow-up evaluation consisted of plain radiography, duplex sonography at 6 months, and computed tomography after the procedure, at 12 months, and then annually. In addition to evaluating safety and feasibility, the study assessed device integrity and freedom from endoleaks, rupture, and migration in follow-up.Attempts to implant 29 endostaples (range 3-7, median 3) were successful in 20 (70%) instances 9 clips did not fully penetrate the graft and tissue due to severe calcification of the wall. They were successfully retractedThe midterm results of this prospective study document the safety and feasibility of the Anson Refix endostapling system. However, further evaluation is mandatory to draw robust conclusions about the utility of this new aortic stent-graft fixation modality.
