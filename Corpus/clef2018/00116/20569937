Pyogenic liver abscesses: diminished role for operative treatment. Pyogenic liver abscess is a rare but potentially serious condition. It has traditionally been treated by open drainage however interventional radiology is now becoming the standard of care.All cases of liver abscesses admitted to a tertiary hospital over thirteen years (1995-2007) were retrospectively reviewed. Patient demographics, length of hospital stay, predisposing factors as well as cultured organisms were evaluated. Imaging techniques as well as patient management were also recorded.There were 66 hospital admissions of 61 patients with liver abscesses, 0.032% (66/205,079) of the total hospital admissions for the time period. Mean age was 61 years (range 26-90 years), male (36/61) 59%: female (25/61) 41%. Average hospital stay was 23 days (Range 1-84 days) and there were no deaths. 39 of 61 patients (64%) had a single abscess (90% right lobe). 20 of 61 patients (33%) had undergone a recent intra-abdominal procedure. Escherichia coli (10/61) and Enterococci (8/61) were the most frequent organisms isolated. Radiological intervention was performed in 50 of 61 (82%, 51% ultrasound and 31% CT guided). 9 of 61 (15%) were managed conservatively, while one case was managed surgically and another with endoscopic sphincterotomy and stent placement.Pyogenic liver abscesses are uncommon, and while associated with significant morbidity and prolonged hospital stay, mortality is now rare. Radiological intervention and anti-microbial therapy are the mainstay of treatment, and operative intervention is now rarely required.
