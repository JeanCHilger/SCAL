Thrombosed abdominal aortic aneurysm associated with an extensively "shaggy" aorta repaired anatomically via a thoracoabdominal approach with supraceliac aortic clamping: report of a case. A 76-year-old man with a history of multiple laparotomies and severe coronary artery disease was referred to our hospital after the sudden development of pain and numbness in the lower extremities. Computed tomography showed a thrombosed abdominal aortic aneurysm and diffuse aortic atherosclerosis compatible with a "shaggy aorta." A good response to thrombolytic therapy permitted elective scheduling of abdominal aortic surgery after coronary artery bypass grafting. We operated via an extended left retroperitoneal approach through a thoracoabdominal incision. Epiaortic ultrasonography revealed that only the supraceliac aorta was free of mobile thrombi and had minimal plaque
