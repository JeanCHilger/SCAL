Cine MRI of the ascending aorta in the elderly with respect to the flow signal void and aortic valve morphology. Cine flow MRI was performed on a 1.5 Tesla system to observe signal intensity of blood flow within the ascending aorta in the elderly who had no aortic stenosis and to determine frequency of the flow signal void. Coronal and sagittal imaging planes of the ascending aorta were obtained in 27 aged patients with no known cardiac diseases (14 men and 13 women, mean age of 76) and 7 young volunteers (7 men, mean age of 24), utilizing ECG-gating. GRASS (gradient-recalled acquisition in steady state), and a flow compensation sequence. The young volunteers presented little or no signal void within the ascending aorta. In 26 (96%) of the 27 aged patients, on the other hand, signal void was demonstrated in the blood flow distal to the aortic valve during systole. The maximum length of the signal void that was measured at 318-632 msec after the R wave of ECG ranged from 33 to 97 mm. Conventional and Doppler echocardiography was used to evaluate motion and morphology of the aortic valve in 19 of the 27 aged patients. Eighteen of these 19 subjects had aortic signal void on cine MRI. Echocardiography showed sclerotic changes of the aortic valve (i.e., increased echogenicity of the cusps and/or commissure fusion) in 10 (53%) of the 19 subjects. The mean maximum length of the signal void in the 10 patients with aortic valve sclerosis was significantly greater than that in the 9 patients with echocardiographically normal valve (68 vs. 45 mm, p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
