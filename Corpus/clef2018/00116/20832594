Post-kidney transplantation lymphocele due to a lymphatic filariasis. Lymphocele is a well-known complication of renal transplantation. Presenting symptoms are nonspecific most patients are entirely asymptomatic. Herein, we have reported a case of lymphocele due to an asymptomatic lymphatic Wuchereria bancrofti filariasis with deterioration of graft function. A 53-year-old man with end-stage renal disease secondary to vascular disease was admitted 40 days after transplantation with vague, isolated abdominal pain. An abdomen and pelvis ultrasound examination demonstrated a cystic structure in the renal hilus. Graft function deteriorated, so the patient underwent puncture of the lymphocele followed by povidone iodine sclerotherapy. In the percutaneous drainage, we noted a fine whitish strand 4-mm thick similar to the shape of the stent, a part of which seemed to go into the transplantation fossa. Parasitological examination showed an adult female worm of W bancrofti measuring 6 cm. The test for microfilaremia was negative. The patient was treated for 10 days with a combination of Ivermectin and Albendazole associated with Doxycycline. The collection rapidly decreased after worm treatment. This case describes a post-renal transplantation lymphocele due to asymptomatic lymphatic filariasis.
