The effect of transversus abdominis plane block for pediatric patients receiving bone graft to the alveolar cleft. Transversus abdominis plane block (TAP block) is useful for lower abdominal operations. Recently, ultrasound guided nerve block has been performed with ultrasound scanning.We investigated the effectiveness of TAP block in 64 pediatric patients (aged 5-12 years, F/M = 21/43) receiving bone graft from the ilium to the alveolar cleft. We compared the dosages for postoperative analgesics between the groups of TAP block and non-TAP block.In the TAP block group, the frequency of using the postoperative analgesics was lower compared with non TAP block group (P < 0.05).We concluded that TAP block was effective in pediatric patients receiving bone graft to the alveolar cleft.
