Comparison of surveillance versus aortic endografting for small aneurysm repair (CAESAR): results from a randomised trial. Randomised trials have failed to demonstrate benefit from early surgical repair of small abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) compared with surveillance. This study aimed to compare results after endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) or surveillance in AAA <5.5 cm.Patients (50-79 years) with AAA of 4.1-5.4 cm were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive immediate EVAR or surveillance by ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) and repair only after a defined threshold (diameter â‰¥5.5 cm, enlargement >1 cm /year, symptoms) was achieved. The main end point was all-cause mortality. Recruitment is closed results at a median follow-up of 32.4 months are here reported.Between 2004 and 2008, 360 patients (early EVAR = 182 surveillance = 178) were enrolled. One perioperative death after EVAR and two late ruptures (both in the surveillance group) occurred. At 54 months, there was no significant difference in the main end-point rate [hazard ratio (HR) 0.76Mortality and rupture rates in AAA <5.5 cm are low and no clear advantage was shown between early or delayed EVAR strategy. However, within 36 months, three out of every five small aneurysms under surveillance might grow to require repair and one out of every six might lose feasibility for EVAR. Surveillance is safe for small AAA if close supervision is applied. Long-term data are needed to confirm these results.This study is registered, NCT Identifier: NCT00118573.
