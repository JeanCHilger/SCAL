Implication of pancreatic image findings in total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation for chronic pancreatitis. To clarify the implication of pancreatic findings on transabdominal ultrasound and/or abdominal computed tomographic scan on outcomes of islet isolation and endocrine function after total pancreatectomy (TP) with islet autotransplantation (IAT).Retrospective review of islet isolations and graft functions in a cohort of patients with chronic pancreatitis who received TP with IAT from December 2007 to September 2009. Patients were categorized into the following 2 groups on the basis of their transabdominal ultrasound or computed tomographic findings before IAT: early group (normal or equivocal of Cambridge classification) and advanced group (mild to marked).A total of 12 patients (early group, n=6 advanced group, n=6) were included. Total islet yield per pancreas weight and per patient body weight in the early group was significantly higher compared with that in the advanced group (6989±659 vs 3567±615 islet equivalents per gram, P<0.01Excellent glycemic control was observed in both groups of patients who received TP with IAT, although the early group showed a significantly better outcome of islet isolation.
