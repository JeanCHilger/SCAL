Treatment of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. To explore the diagnosis and treatment of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (RAAA).Between January 1996 and December 2009, 14 patients with RAAA were treated. There were 13 males and 1 female with an average age of 65 years (range, 50-82 years). The main clinical manifestations were abdominal pain and/or back pain. Ten cases had low blood pressure or shock. All cases were accurately diagnosed with CT, Doppler ultrasonography, or operation. The aneurysm diameter was from 4.5 cm to 8.0 cm. Eleven cases were treated by conventional operation, 1 by endovascular aortic repair, 1 by conservative treatment, and 1 case died after admission treatment.Perioperative death occurred in 6 cases (mortality rate was 50%) in 12 surgical patients. One case died after conservative treatment. The overall mortality rate was 57.14% (8/14). The causes of death included circulatory failure in 2 cases and multiple organ failure in 4 cases. The other 6 cases were cured. The postoperative hospitalization days were 12 to 34 days (14 days on average). A total of 4 cases were followed up 11 to 40 months without related complication.Surgical treatment is still a main method to treat RAAA. Early diagnosis, appropriate resuscitation, and urgent surgical repair are crucial to reduce the mortality rate of RAAA.
