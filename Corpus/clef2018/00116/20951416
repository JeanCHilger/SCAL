Radiological treatment of renal artery occlusion after blunt abdominal trauma in a pediatric patient: is it never too late? A 15-year-old boy was severely injured in a motor vehicle accident. A blunt abdominal trauma resulted in multiple lesions requiring urgent surgical treatment. Seven days after the trauma, renal Doppler sonography showed absence of arterial signal in the left kidney hilum. Selective renal angiography was performed, showing localized aneurysmatic dilatation in the principal branch of the left renal artery with interruption of renal parenchyma blood flow. Stent graft placement resulted in the resumption of a normal perfusion. After long-term follow-up, symmetric renal function has been demonstrated. Our results confirmed the efficacy of endovascular treatment in the management of pediatric patients with renal artery occlusion after blunt abdominal trauma. The outcome appeared excellent even after a prolonged period of renal ischemia.
