Endoluminal closure of ductus arteriosus. A cooperative study. Thirty-two patients from 3 Pediatric Cardiological Centres underwent attempted endoluminal transcatheter closure of a patent ductus arteriosus. The patients' age ranged from 8 months to 67 years, but there were only 2 adults (18 and 67 years) in this series. All patients had a murmur which was continuous in 28 cases and systolic in 4 cases. Nine patients had left ventricular hypertrophy on the electrocardiogram and radiological cardiomegaly. Closure of the patent ductus was attempted by Rashkind's technique using a double umbrella of 12 mm diameter for ductus less than 4 mm diameter (26 cases), and an umbrella of 17 mm diameter when the ductus was wider (6 cases). The immediate results judged by retrograde aortography showed total occlusion in 12 patients and incomplete closure in 17 others with persistence of a minimal left-to-right shunt. In 3 cases, embolisation of the umbrella into the left pulmonary artery (2 cases) or right pulmonary artery (1 case), required thoracotomy to extract the umbrella and at the same time section-suture of the ductus arteriosus. Color Doppler echocardiographic follow-up showed the disappearance of the residual shunt in seven children.
