Synchronized epiaortic two-dimensional and color Doppler echocardiographic guidance enables routine ascending aortic cannulation in type A acute aortic dissection. Preference for arterial inflow during surgery for type A acute aortic dissection remains controversial. Antegrade central perfusion prevents malperfusion and retrograde embolism, and the ascending aorta provides arterial access for rapid establishment of systemic perfusion, especially if there is hemodynamic instability. It has not been used routinely, however, because of the disruption caused to the aorta. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of routine cannulation of the dissected aorta for the repair of type A dissection.Surgical results were analyzed for 83 consecutive patients with type A acute aortic dissection between 2002 and 2009. They were treated surgically by prosthetic graft replacement under hypothermic circulatory arrest. The ascending aorta was routinely cannulated using the Seldinger technique with epiaortic echocardiographic guidance antegrade systemic perfusion was evaluated by color Doppler ultrasound.Systemic antegrade perfusion via the dissected ascending aorta was performed safely in all cases. There was no malperfusion or thromboembolism as a result of ascending aortic cannulation. Epiaortic 2-dimensional and color Doppler imaging provided real-time monitoring adequate for the placement and for proper systemic perfusion. There were 5 in-hospital deaths (5/83=6.0%) and 8 strokes (preoperative 6/83=7.2%, postoperative 2/83=2.4%). A total of 78 patients (78/83=94%) were discharged and have been followed up without major adverse cardiac events for a mean duration of 31.8 months.Ascending aortic cannulation is a simple and safe technique that provides a rapid and reliable route of antegrade central systemic perfusion in type A aortic dissection.
