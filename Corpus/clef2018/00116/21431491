Saphenous vein wrapping for the treatment of a perigraft seroma: report of a case. A 61-year-old man who had undergone an iliofemoral bypass with an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft was readmitted to our hospital for the investigation and treatment of a possible complication of the surgery. A tender, pulsatile, bulging mass, about the size of an adult fist, was palpated around the left lower abdominal region. Diagnostic procedures showed a large low-density area around the PTFE graft and angiography revealed a patent graft with no anastomotic leakage. An operative inspection revealed the mass to be a large perigraft seroma. The PTFE graft was covered with a saphenous vein strip, a treatment that has not previously been mentioned in the literature. The success of this strategy was confirmed by clinical observations and diagnostic procedures including ultrasonography and computed tomography, with no sign of recurrence for 5 months.
