Primary adenocarcinoma in a kidney allograft: a case report and review of the literature. De novo tumors are common complications after solid organ transplantation. Lymphoma and skin cancers are the most frequently observed malignancies. However, graft carcinomas can be observed to be five times more frequent after kidney transplantation compared to their incidence in the general population. We report a case of a 49-year-old female who developed an early adenocarcinoma of the graft as revealed by acute renal failure. She underwent transplantectomy and chemotherapy with hemodialysis therapy. Carcinoma of the graft is a rare but serious complication usually occurring late after transplantation. Close monitoring of a kidney recipient using abdominal ultrasound may detect this complication at early stages, which may improve the prognosis. Similarly, good screening of donors may prevent tumor transmission.
