A novel experimental animal model of arterial stenosis based on endovascular radiofrequency energy application. To develop a new rabbit model of arterial stenosis using endovascular radiofrequency (RF) energy.Ten rabbits were used for multiple endovascular RF applications to the aorta and left common carotid artery through the Habib™ VesCoag™ catheter. Angiography and color Doppler ultrasound were used to assess vessel patency immediately following the procedure and six weeks later. One rabbit was sacrificed following the procedure for histopathologic analysis of the vessel wall. Two rabbits died of aortic and carotid rupture, respectively, immediately after the procedure. The remaining seven rabbits were sacrificed after six-week follow-up for histopathological analysis.Optimal RF generator settings to induce significant arterial stenosis (>50%) without complications were standardized at 24-26 watts (W) for 1.5 min for the aorta and 6 W for 1 min for the common carotid artery. The six-week follow-up showed permanent results in all surviving rabbits. Histopathology revealed intima and medial smooth muscle layer necrosis.We have developed a novel rabbit model of arterial stenosis using endovascular RF energy. Our model is fast, safe, inexpensive, and reproducible. It would be useful for experimental investigations and new therapeutic devices.
