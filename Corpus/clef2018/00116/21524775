Design and in vitro evaluation of a real-time catheter localization system using time of flight measurements from seven 3.5 MHz single element ultrasound transducers towards abdominal aortic aneurysm procedures. Interventional surgical instrument localization is a crucial component of minimally invasive surgery. Image guided surgery researchers are investigating devices broadly categorized as surgical localizers to provide real-time information on the instrument's 3D location and orientation only. This paper describes the implementation and in vitro evaluation of a prototype real-time nonimaging ultrasound-based catheter localizer system towards use in abdominal aortic aneurysm procedures. The catheter-tip is equipped with a single element ultrasound transducer which is tracked with an array of seven external single element transducers. The performance of the system was evaluated in a water tank and additionally in the presence of pork belly tissue and also a nitinol-dacron stent graft. The mean root mean square errors were respectively 1.94±0.06, 2.54±0.31 and 3.33±0.06 mm. In addition, this paper illustrates errors induced by transducer aperture size and suggests a method for aperture error compensation. Aperture compensation applied to the same experimental data yielded mean root mean square errors of 1.05±0.07, 2.42±0.33 and 3.23±0.07mm respectively for water water and pork
