Retrograde supra-aortic stent placement combined with open carotid or subclavian artery revascularization. To review the outcomes of retrograde supra-aortic vessel stent (RSAS) placement combined with open carotid or subclavian artery revascularization.Retrospective review of all consecutive patients between 1995 and 2010, excluding transfemoral procedures or isolated retrograde stent placement.There were 11 patients (9 females, mean age 65 years). Open revascularization included carotid endarterectomy in 6 patients, carotid-subclavian bypass in 3, and carotid-carotid bypass in 2 patients. There were no operative deaths or neurological events. All symptomatic patients improved. Over a mean follow-up of 24 months, One patient developed common carotid artery (CCA) in-stent dissection and symptomatic restenosis treated with subclavian-carotid bypass. Another 3 patients had asymptomatic restenosis of the carotid bifurcation but required no intervention.Retrograde stenting of the common carotid or innominate artery is a safe and effective method to provide inflow in selected patients with severe supra-aortic vessel disease who require concomitant open carotid or subclavian artery reconstructions.
