Ultrasound-guided puncture of the femoral artery for total percutaneous aortic aneurysm repair. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of ultrasound-guided femoral artery access for total percutaneous endovascular repair of abdominal and thoracic aortic aneurysms.Total percutaneous aneurysm repair of the abdominal and thoracic aorta was performed in 52 consecutive patients (46 males, 6 females mean age, 64.6Â±16 yearsThe outer diameter of the vascular sheaths or the stent graft system ranged from 14 F to 27 F. All but one patient achieved successful closure of the arterial puncture with the closure device. One patient required surgical cutdown because of device failure. Two patients required long-duration manual compression. Technical success was achieved in 49 patients (94%). Forty-five patients (87%) were discharged on the first postoperative day. There were no complications of the access arteries one day or one month postoperatively, as determined by ultrasonography and computed tomography examinations, respectively. The mean diameters of the access arteries prior to and one month after the procedure were unchanged, as demonstrated by computed tomography.Ultrasound-guided puncture of the common femoral artery for percutaneous closure of the access site has a high technical success rate and a very low complication rate. The addition of ultrasound guidance decreases the difficulty of the procedure and helps to avoid some of its complications.
