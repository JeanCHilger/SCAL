Thoracic aortic pulsatility decreases during hypovolemic shock: implications for stent-graft sizing. To investigate the thoracic aortic pulsatility during hypovolemic shock in an experimental porcine model.The circulating blood volume of 7 healthy Yorkshire pigs was gradually lowered until the subjects had lost 40% of their normal blood volume. Intravascular ultrasound was used to assess the aortic pulsatility in normovolemic and hypovolemic state at the level of the ascending and descending thoracic aorta.The mean aortic pulsatility at the level of the ascending aorta decreased from 15.9% ± 7.2% (range 6.3%-25.7%) in normovolemia to 6.2% ± 2.8% (range 2.9%-10.7%, p = 0.018) in hypovolemia. At the level of the descending thoracic aorta, the mean aortic pulsatility decreased from 8.7% ± 2.8% (range 4.4%-12.2%) at baseline to 5.6% ± 2.5% (range 1.5%-9.5%, p = 0.028) in hypovolemia. The maximum mean aortic diameter, obtained in cardiac systole, was significantly smaller as well at both evaluated levels during hypovolemic shock compared with the mean diameter in normovolemia.The thoracic aortic diameter and pulsatility decreased significantly during hypovolemic shock in this porcine model, most impressively at the level of the ascending aorta. Electrocardiographically-gated imaging may not be necessary for hypovolemic patients with acute aortic disease requiring endovascular repair because of the minimal aortic pulsatility.
