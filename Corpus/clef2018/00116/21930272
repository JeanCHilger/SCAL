Qualitative score of systemic arteriosclerosis by vascular ultrasonography as a predictor of coronary artery disease in type 2 diabetes. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are at risk of polyvascular comorbidities and poor prognosis. Non-invasive techniques for early prediction of coronary artery disease (CAD) are desirable to prevent cardiovascular events in these patients. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between CAD and systemic arteriosclerosis by qualitative vascular ultrasonography.The study subjects were 102 consecutive outpatients with T2DM [males/females = 60/42, age: mean ± SD 67 ± 9 (range, 40-85) years] evaluated by vascular ultrasonography for arteriosclerosis in the abdominal aorta, carotid, renal, and common iliac arteries. The total number of detected arteriosclerotic vascular lesions in the four arteries was determined. CAD was diagnosed by two cardiologists using either stress electrocardiography, myocardial scintigraphy, multi-detector row computed tomography or coronary angiography.Multiple arteriosclerotic vascular lesions (>1) were detected in 64 (63%) patients. The total systemic vascular score was significantly higher in patients with CAD than those without (average score 2.7 versus 1.0, p < 0.0001). None of the CAD patients had a total score of 0. Age- and sex-adjusted multiple logistic regression analysis identified total score of ≥ 2 as the only predictor of CAD (p < 0.001). The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for total systemic vascular score in the prediction of CAD were 98%, 77%, 83%, and 97%, respectively, which were better than those for carotid mean and maximum intima-media thickness.Non-invasive qualitative evaluation of systemic arteriosclerosis by the total systemic vascular score is potentially useful for the early prediction of CAD in T2DM patients.
