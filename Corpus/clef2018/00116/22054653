Abdominal aorta aneurysms in children: single-center experience of six patients. Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are rare in children and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality as in adults. We summarize our experience in the diagnosis and management of AAAs in 6 children at a single institution.The clinical data of 6 pediatric patients with AAAs treated at our hospital from November 2005 to November 2008 were retrospectively analyzed.There were 4 males and 2 females with a mean age at diagnosis of 8 years (range, 17 months to 18 years). All patients presented with pulsatile abdominal masses. Color Doppler ultrasonography and computed tomography angiography were the primary diagnostic tools. One patient has a history of tuberous sclerosis, and 1 had Takayasu's arteritis no risk factors or identifiable causes were found in the other patients. All of the AAAs identified were infrarenal. Surgical reconstruction with aneurysm resection and prosthetic graft placement was performed successfully in all 6 cases. No intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred. Mean follow-up has been 48 months (range, 32 to 69). In 1 patient, recurrence was noted at 3 years postoperatively. The patient's family declined further surgery, and the patient died, likely of rupture of the aneurysm at 41 months postoperatively. All other patients are currently alive and well.Our experience indicates that good outcomes can be obtained in children with AAAs with prompt and accurate diagnosis and surgical management with artificial grafts.
