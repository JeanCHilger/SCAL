Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm in coronary care unit patients with acute myocardial infarction using portable transthoracic echocardiography. Patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) represent a high-risk population in which screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is recommended but only occasionally performed. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) may offer the unique opportunity to evaluate the cardiac function and to screen for AAA during the same examination. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of AAA screening at bedside using a portable cardiac ultrasound (US) echo machine and to determine the prevalence of AAA in population with AMI.The AA diameter was measured at bedside at the end of a regular TTE performed in consecutive patients admitted for AMI in the coronary care unit using a portable echo machine (Vividi, General Electric). AAA was defined by a transverse diameter of ≥ 30 mm. We prospectively enrolled 193 patients (65 ± 11 years, 77% male). Measurement of the AA diameter was feasible in 93% and the duration was 3 ± 1 min. An AAA was observed in nine patients (4.7%) and the prevalence increased with age (7.7% after 60 years and 9.2% after 65 years). No AAA was observed in patients under 50 years old. Inter-observer variability between cardiologists using the portable US system was excellent (mean difference 1.8 ± 2.0 mm) as well as the accuracy compared with measurements performed by a radiologist using a dedicated vascular US system (mean difference 1.5 ± 1.3 mm).Overall, the prevalence of AAA was 4.7%, increased with age, and seems higher than expected in the 'same-aged population'. In regard to the simplicity, accuracy, and feasibility, screening for AAA during TTE (one cardiovascular shot) may be of value after AMI especially in elderly patients.
