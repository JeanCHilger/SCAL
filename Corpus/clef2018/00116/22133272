Thrombolytic efficacy of tissue plasminogen activator-loaded echogenic liposomes in a rabbit thrombus model. Ultrasound (US)-enhanced thrombolytic treatment protocols currently in clinical trials for stroke applications involve systemic administration of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA Alteplase), which carries a risk of adverse bleeding events. The present study aimed to compare the thrombolytic efficacy of a tPA-loaded echogenic liposome (ELIP) formulation with insonification protocols causing rapid fragmentation or acoustically-driven diffusion.Thrombi were induced in the abdominal aortas of male New Zealand white rabbits (2-3kg) using thrombin and a sclerosing agent (sodium ricinoleate) after aortic denudation with a balloon catheter. Thrombolytic and cavitation nucleation agents (200μg of tPA alone, tPA mixed with 50μg of a microbubble contrast agent, or tPA-loaded ELIP) were bolus- injected proximal to the clot through a catheter introduced into the abdominal aorta from the carotid artery. Clots were exposed to transabdominal color Doppler US (6MHz) for 30 minutes at a low mechanical index (MI=0.2) to induce sustained bubble activity (acoustically-driven diffusion), or for 2 minutes at an MI of 0.4 to cause ELIP fragmentation. Degree of recanalization was determined by Doppler flow measurements distal to the clots.All treatments showed thrombolysis, but tPA-loaded ELIP was the most efficacious regimen. Both US treatment strategies enhanced thrombolytic activity over control conditions.The thrombolytic efficacy of tPA-loaded ELIP is comparable to other clinically described effective treatment protocols, while offering the advantages of US monitoring and enhanced thrombolysis from a site-specific delivery agent.
