A case report of the reinforcing technique with collared prosthesis for the prosthetic valve endocarditis in mitral position. A 58-year-old female was admitted to our hospital because of the prosthetic valve endocarditis in mitral position. In the past, this patient was undertaken double valve replacement in mitral and aortic position. Nevertheless, postoperative course was not in stable condition, showing persistent sign of the infection. The appearance of mitral regurgitant murmur and regurgitant signal by colour Doppler cardiography could make sure of the diagnosis for prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) in mitral position. The operation for PVE in mitral prosthesis was undertaken as follows. As there was extensive annular infection around the mitral valve, the new mitral prosthesis (Duromedics valve) with the Gore-tex flange, so called collared prosthesis, was revised. The collared prosthesis was implanted in the mitral annulus by using the suture ring of the Duromedics valve as well as possible, furthermore, the Gore-tex flange were sutured in the left atrial wall 2 cm above the mitral ring. Postoperatively, the infection sign and congestive heart failure were completely subsided. This patient has been in very healthy condition these days and restored to the daily life.
