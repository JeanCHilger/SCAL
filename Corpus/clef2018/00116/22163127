Perimembranous ventricular septal defect with aneurysm: two options for transcatheter closure. We present our experience with 2 options for device closure of perimembranous ventricular septal defect with aneurysm. Thirty-four patients with perimembranous ventricular septal defect with aneurysm, aged from 14 to 42 years, underwent transcatheter closure with modified double-disk occluders. A sheath was used to deliver the occluder after establishment of a stable "arteriovenous loop" under fluoroscopy. Electrocardiography and transthoracic echocardiography were used for follow-up. All but 1 patient experienced successful transcatheter closure of perimembranous ventricular septal defect with aneurysm, when occluders were used in 2 different positions. There were 19 patients whose perimembranous ventricular septal defects were closed at the inlet of the aneurysm and 15 patients whose defects were closed at the outlet. Eight patients had a residual shunt immediately after the procedure, which disappeared during follow-up. One patient developed minor aortic regurgitation. Four patients who manifested different types of conductive block were all in the group that underwent closure at the inlet of the aneurysm. No other complications were observed during follow-up.We infer that perimembranous ventricular septal defect with aneurysm can be successfully closed with modified double-disk occluders. Each of the 2 options that we have presented for transcatheter closure of perimembranous ventricular septal defect with aneurysm has its advantages and disadvantages. Ultimately, the configuration of the lesion should decide the type and position of the device.
