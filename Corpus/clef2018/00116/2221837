Exclusive piezoelectric lithotripsy in the treatment of calculi larger than 30 mm (partial or complete coralliform, pyelic calculi). Thirty patients with partial or total staghorn stones or calculi larger than 30 mm were treated by piezoelectric lithotripsy (PEL) monotherapy using an EDAP LT-01 lithotripter with ultrasound guidance. Nineteen of these patients had pelvic stones the other 11 had partial (9) or total (2) staghorn stones. All patients first underwent an initial lithotripsy session. No anesthesia or IV sedation was required in any case. If stone fragmentation was achieved during this first session, a double-J stent was inserted before the second lithotripsy session. Prior to the first session, 18 of 30 patients had sterile urine cultures
