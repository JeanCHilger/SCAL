Aneurysmal aorto-right ventricular tunnel. A successful closure of an aneurysmal aorto-right ventricular tunnel (ARVT) in a 16-year-old male patient is reported here. An attempt at device closure had failed in this patient. Diagnosis was confirmed by Doppler echocardiography, 3-dimensional computed tomography, and cardiac catheterization. Surgical closure with a Dacron patch (W.L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, AZ) at the aortic end and direct closure at the ventricular end was done successfully with the patient under mild hypothermia. The postoperative echocardiogram showed a competent aortic valve with a closed ARVT.
