Crossover femoropopliteal bypass: single graft or double grafts. Both single-graft crossover femoropopliteal (COFP) bypass and crossover femorofemoral plus femoropopliteal bypasses using double grafts may be performed for patients with a medical history of abdominal vascular operations or comorbidity, thereby ineligible for retroperitoneal or transperitoneal approaches. In this study, these two methods were compared.A total of 15 patients who were operated on between February 2002 and March 2010 were included and studied retrospectively. Eight of them underwent crossover femorofemoral bypass plus femoropopliteal bypass with double grafts (group 1), whereas the rest seven underwent single-graft COFP bypass (group 2). All the patients were included either in class 3 or class 4 according to Fontaine classification. Preoperative arterial Doppler ultrasound and arteriography were obtained from every patient. Pre- and postoperative ankle-brachial indices were measured. Postoperative clinical parameters were obtained from medical records.Median primary and secondary patency rates were 40.5 (7-105) months and 58 (7-105) months in group 1, respectively. In group 2, these rates were 42 (2-84) months and 44 (11-84) months, respectively. Two patients in group 1 and one patient in group 2 were amputated. There were no significant differences between both groups in terms of duration of hospital stay, duration of intensive care unit stay, and units of packed red blood cells transfused (P > 0.05). In addition, postoperative ankle-brachial indices were significantly improved in both groups (P < 0.05). COFP bypass can be performed for limb salvage in cases with critical limb ischemia with a medical history of previous vascular surgery or comorbidity, thereby ineligible for aortic reconstruction.This procedure may also be performed as continuous COFP bypass using a single graft.
