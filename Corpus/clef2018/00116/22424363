Infected common iliac artery aneurysm repaired in an infant with cadaveric vein graft. Aneurysms are rare in children. Causes include congenital, traumatic, inflammatory, and infectious etiologies. When and how to best surgically treat arterial aneurysms in a child remain unclear. We present the case of a 3-month-old child with an aneurysm of the left common iliac artery, which was first detected on abdominal ultrasound and was successfully repaired with a cadaveric vein graft.
