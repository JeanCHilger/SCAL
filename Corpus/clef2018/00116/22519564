Percutaneous mitral valve repair in patients with prior cardiac surgery. The safety of percutaneous mitral valve repair with the MitraClip system has been documented. However, few data are available on high-risk patients not amenable to surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of patients with prior cardiac surgery undergoing MitraClip therapy (Abbott, Abbott Park, Chicago, IL, USA) for severe mitral regurgitation.We reported two cases of percutaneous treatment of severe mitral regurgitation performed in patients who had previously undergone cardiac surgery with the implantation of mechanical prosthetic aortic valve.In both the reported cases a sustained reduction in mitral regurgitation severity was obtained at two-year follow-up, with a relevant improvement in terms of clinical status and quality of life.Percutaneous mitral valve repair using the MitraClip system represents a viable treatment choice for severe mitral regurgitation in high-risk patients who have previously undergone cardiac surgery.
