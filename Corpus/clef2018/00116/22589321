Evaluation of abdominal aortic aneurysm after endovascular repair: prospective validation of contrast-enhanced US with a second-generation US contrast agent. To prospectively assess the accuracy of contrast agent-enhanced (CE) ultrasonography (US) with a second-generation US contrast agent in the detection and classification of endoleaks after endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (EVAR), with computed tomographic (CT) angiography as the reference standard.Institutional review board and written informed consent were obtained. Thirty-five patients who underwent EVAR were enrolled in a prospective study that consisted of CT angiography and CE US studies performed at 1- and 6-month follow-up and performed yearly thereafter. CE US was performed after bolus injection of 2.4 mL of sulfur hexafluoride by using equipment with specific software for contrast studies. Angiography was performed in patients who had type II endoleaks with an increase in aneurysm sac size and in patients with type I or III endoleaks. CE US sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy were determined for endoleak detection, and Cohen Îº statistic was used to assess agreement of CE US and CT angiographic findings for endoleak classification.A total of 126 CT angiographic and CE US studies were performed. CT angiography depicted 34 endoleaks in 16 patients (type IA, n=1 type IB, n=1CE US yields good sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in endoleak detection, and it might represent a noninvasive tool that can be used in the follow-up of patients who undergo EVAR.
