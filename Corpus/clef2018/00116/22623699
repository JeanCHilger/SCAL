Time-resolved CT angiography for the detection and classification of endoleaks. To assess the feasibility and diagnostic performance of time-resolved computed tomographic (CT) angiography in the detection and classification of endoleaks after endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) in high-risk patients.The study was approved by our ethics committee. Written informed consent was obtained from all participating patients. Fifty-four patients (42 male and 12 female patients mean age, 70.9 years ± 9.3 [standard deviation]) with either thoracic (n = 8) or abdominal (n = 46) aortic aneurysms treated with a stent-graft were prospectively included. The patients were examined with a time-resolved CT angiographic protocol consisting of 12 low-dose phases (80 kVpAll time-resolved CT angiographic data sets were diagnostic. Mean effective radiation dose was 14.6 mSv. Four thoracic and 19 abdominal endoleaks were identified by using time-resolved CT angiography. Seventeen of 19 abdominal endoleaks were confirmed with CE US. This rate resulted in a sensitivity of 94%, a specificity of 93%, a positive predictive value of 89%, and a negative predictive value of 96% for time-resolved CT angiography after abdominal EVAR. Type I endoleaks showed significantly earlier mean peak contrast enhancement (0.28 second ± 0.83) compared with that for type II endoleaks (9.17 seconds ± 3.59, P < .0001).Time-resolved CT angiography with 12 low-dose phases is feasible for patients after thoracic and abdominal EVAR. The protocol approximates the radiation dose of standard triphasic protocols. Its dynamic information differentiates types of endoleaks and shows high diagnostic performance.
