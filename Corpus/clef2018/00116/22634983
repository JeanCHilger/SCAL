Patterns of markers of inflammation, coagulation and vasoconstriction during follow-up of abdominal aortic aneurysms. The etiology of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) includes inflammation, coagulation, and endothelial dysfunction. We have prospectively evaluated relations between these mechanisms and AAA growth. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, endothelin (ET)-1, CD40 ligand and the complex formed between activated protein C (APC) and protein C inhibitor (PCI) were measured annually and related to AAA growth during up to 5 years in 206 patients with conservatively followed AAA.We evaluated 163 patients up to 1 year, 126 patients up to 2 years, 83 patients up to 3 years, 53 patients up to 4 years, and 33 patients up to 5 years. The total number of patient follow-up years was 458.ET-1 remained unchanged except for a tendency to increase in the third and fourth years of follow-up. TNF-α decreased significantly during the first year and thereafter increased back to baseline values. There were no changes in IL-6, CD40 ligand, and APC-PCI complex. When patients in the highest and lowest quartiles of AAA growth up to 5 years follow-up were compared, APC-PCI complex levels tended to be higher (P=0.06) in the highest quartile of growth at three years (0.45 µg/l [i.q.r. 0.40-0.77] versus 0.28 µg/L [i.q.r. 0.14-0.36]). Δ-values of ET-1 and TNF-α did not show any correlation to growth. The 14 AAA patients that ruptured during follow-up did not differ from patients with non-ruptured AAA regarding biomarkers.In conclusion, none of the investigated mediators could be used to predict growth or rupture, or help to prolong intervals between ultrasound examinations in follow-up of AAA patients.
