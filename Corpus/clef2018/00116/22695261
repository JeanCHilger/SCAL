Long term data of endovascularly treated patients with severe and complex aortoiliac occlusive disease. This paper presents the recent data of the largest series (20 patients) of endovascularly treated patients and the first long term data of 9 patients with severe aortoiliac occlusive disease.Between 2003 and 2012, 20 consecutive patients (14 men 70 %) with Leriche syndrome underwent recanalization with solely endovascular means at our centre. The treatment strategy comprised the antegrade (transbrachial) recanalization of the occluded segments followed by retrograde (transfemoral) angioplasty with selective stent placement in the infrarenal aorta and primary stent placement in the iliac arteries. Before discharge, after 30 days and every year after the procedure, a clinical, as well as a duplex ultrasonographic examination including measurement of the ankle-brachial index was done.Bilateral success was achieved in 17 patients (85%). Unilateral success was achieved in three patients (15%). In one patient (5%) an early reocclusion of the stented segments occurred, necessitating bypass grafting. In nine patients long term data were evaluated. Here, the ankle brachial index (ABI) significantly increased (0.85 ± 0.15 vs. 0.51 ± 0.11 at baseline P=0.002). Compared to baseline, the difference in the distribution of Rutherford category and the improvement of walking capacity were statistically significant (P=0.0006, P=0.01, respectively).This study shows the feasibility of solely endovascular management of severe aortoiliac occlusive disease with a high rate of success and low rate of complications. Significant clinical improvement of patients in long term follow up makes the endovascular approach a viable alternative to open surgery.
