Use of colour duplex ultrasound as a first line surveillance tool following EVAR is associated with a reduction in cost without compromising accuracy. CT scanning remains the postoperative surveillance imaging modality of choice following EVAR. Concerns regarding cost, exposure to ionising radiation and intravenous contrast have led to a search for a less expensive, equally efficacious and safer method of monitoring EVAR patients after endograft deployment. This study evaluated the cost saving obtained if CDUS was employed as a first line surveillance tool following EVAR, as well as comparing the two entities in terms of efficacy.Postoperative surveillance CTs and CDUS scans in the 145 patients who have undergone EVAR from 1st June 2003 to 1st July 2010 were compared for the detection of endoleak and determination of residual sac size.Adopting a protocol where CDUS was employed as the first line surveillance tool following EVAR would result in a reduction in the number of postoperative CTs required in 2010 from 235 to 36. Based on 2010 costings, this would equate to an estimated reduction in expenditure from €117,500 to €34,915 a saving of €82,585. CDUS had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 85% in the detection of endoleaks compared to CT. The positive predictive value was 28% and negative predictive value 100%. The Pearson Coefficient correlation of 0.96 indicates a large degree of correlation between CDUS and CT when measuring residual aneurysm size following EVAR.CDUS can replace CT as the first line surveillance tool following EVAR. This is associated with a significant reduction in the cost of surveillance without any loss of imaging accuracy.
