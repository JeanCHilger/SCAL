Surgical treatment of carotid restenosis after eversion endarterectomy--Serbian bicentric prospective study. The increased number of carotid endarterectomies performed worldwide in recent years is associated with a greater need for carotid restenosis evaluation. Carotid restenosis rate ranges from 0.6% to 3.6% in symptomatic patients and from 8.8% to 19% in asymptomatic patients. Carotid angioplasty and stenting is a preferable therapeutic choice for carotid restenosis treatment, but whenever it is not technically feasible (tortuosities of supra-aortic branches, calcifications, pathological elongation, or very extensive lesions), redo surgical treatment is indicated. The aim of our study was to examine outcome of redo surgical treatment in patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid restenosis, in whom carotid angioplasty could not be done, and its impact on early and late morbidity and mortality.The study included 52 patients who were surgically treated for significant carotid restenosis from January 2000 to December 2008 in two high-volume vascular surgery university clinics. Surgical techniques included redo eversion endarterectomy, standard endarterectomy with Dacron patch closure, and Dacron tubular graft interposition. The patients were followed for significant events (transient ischemic attack, stroke, cranial nerve injuries, surgical site hematoma, the occurrence of carotid re-restenosis, or occlusion), and mortality after 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, and annually afterward.In the early postoperative period (within 30 days), there were no lethal outcomes. Transient ischemic attack was diagnosed in four patients (7.6%), minor stroke in two patients (3.8%), and cranial nerve injury in four patients (7.6%). After 4 years, three patients died (5.7%), two due to a fatal myocardial infarction (3.8%) and one after a major stroke (1.9%) four patients (7.6%) had ipsilateral strokeCarotid angioplasty might be a primary option for carotid restenosis treatment, but whenever it cannot be performed, redo surgical treatment is indicated, owing to its acceptable rate of early and late postoperative complications.
