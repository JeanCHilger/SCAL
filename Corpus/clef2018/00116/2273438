A 24-year follow-up of a large omphalocele: from Silon pouch to pregnancy. In 1970, this patient was first reported after her massive ventral hernia was repaired. Her large omphalocele was initially covered with skin flaps as a newborn, and at 3 years of age the resulting ventral hernia was completely repaired using the staging technique described by Schuster, and modified by Plzak and Gross. Silon sheeting was used as a temporary prosthesis. She remained well until 1988 (age 23 years) when she became pregnant with the expected date of confinement January 10, 1989. The first two trimesters were uneventful with sonograms showing a normal male fetus who was gaining weight appropriately. By the third trimester the abdominal girth did not increase coincident with the baby's size, vomiting prevented adequate caloric intake, and pelvic pressure from the baby's head caused increasing discomfort. She spent 7 weeks in the hospital on intravenous therapy, including peripheral total parenteral nutrition, and delivered vaginally, with the aid of forceps, a 2.9-kg normal boy 5 weeks prematurely. This is the first reported case of a large omphalocele patient conceiving and delivering a normal fetus. It also demonstrates the potential problems related to multiple surgical procedures to close a large congenital abdominal wall defect.
