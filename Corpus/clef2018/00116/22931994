Management of multiple type II endoleaks detected by duplex ultrasound after endovascular abdominal aneurysm repair. We reported a case of multiple type II endoleaks detected by duplex ultrasound after endovascular abdominal aneurysm repair. The patient was undergoing warfarin therapy. Duplex ultrasound was applied as the sole surveillance method during follow-up and provided the concerned information for reintervention. The endoleaks were successfully repaired by coil embolization of the collaterals from the internal iliac artery feeding the fourth lumbar artery.
