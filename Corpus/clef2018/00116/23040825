Total arch replacement under flow monitoring during selective cerebral perfusion using a single pump. Flow in individual vessels is passively determined when a single pump is used for selective cerebral perfusion during aortic arch surgery. We installed a Doppler flowmeter in the circuit and measured flow in the supraaortic vessels to determine flow distribution during selective cerebral perfusion.We cannulated and perfused three supraaortic vessels using a single pump in 203 patients who underwent elective (n = 158) or emergency or urgent (n = 45) total arch replacement using a four-branched prosthetic graft. Flow rates in each branch were continuously monitored during selective cerebral perfusion.The respective mean flow rates in the brachiocephalic, left common carotid, and left subclavian arteries and total flow rates were 5.8, 3.3, 3.4, and 12.5 mL·kg(-1)·min(-1). The ratios of flow in these vessels to total flow were 46.5%, 26.5%, and 27.0%, respectively, and they were not affected by the total flow rate. In-hospital mortality rates among the patients who underwent elective and emergency or urgent surgery were 1.9% (n = 3) and 11.1% (n = 5), respectively, and the rates of postoperative stroke were 2.5% (n = 4) and 8.9% (n = 4), respectively. Total flow in the supraaortic vessels during selective cerebral perfusion was significantly lower in patients with neurologic complications than in those without (732 versus 806 mL/min p = 0.034).Flow monitoring showed that selective perfusion using a single pump adequately distributed flow among all supraaortic vessels. This monitoring system might help to improve brain protection and outcomes during total aortic arch replacement.
