Stagewise surgical treatment in type III B chronic aortic dissection. Presented herein is a clinical case report of successful surgical treatment (open and endovascular operation) of a patient with DeBakey type III B chronic aortic dissection. The diagnosis was verified by contrast-enhanced multispiral computed tomography (MSCT). The first stage consisted in operation of carotid-subclavian bypass grafting and aortomy with dissection of the internal membrane of the abdominal aorta, dividing the false and true channels. The second stage included endovascular prosthetic repair of the thoracic aorta with the Relay stent graft. The course of the postoperative period was uneventful. According to the MSCT findings 2 months after the intervention, the endograft was patent, with neither shift nor endoleack. The false channel along the descending thoracic aorta is thrombosed. The maximal diameter of the abdominal aorta does not exceed 4 cm. According to the findings of duplex scanning, the carotid-subclavian bypass is functioning. The patient's condition is satisfactory.
