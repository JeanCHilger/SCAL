Uterine arteriovenous malformation formed in a large uterine cervical myoma. Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) can arise in various organs, particularly the brain, but it is rare in the uterus.  Uterine AVM is potentially lethal and is generally associated with uterine trauma, such as dilatation and curettage, therapeutic abortion or uterine surgery.  On the other hand, uterine myoma is the most common benign gynecological tumor, but uterine cervical myoma is rare and grows in the extraperitoneal space, with development of complex capillary networks within the tumor.  Cervical myoma surgery is therefore a difficult operation with a risk of massive bleeding.  We report herein a patient with uterine AVM formed within a large cervical myoma in a postmenopausal woman.  The patient was a 55-year-old Japanese woman who complained of lower abdominal distension.  Ultrasonography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed an 18 Ã— 20-cm uterine cervical tumor with dilatation of numerous vessels.  Pelvic angiography was scheduled to provide accurate diagnosis and to minimize intraoperative blood loss.  In fact, preoperative pelvic angiography allowed us to identify the true feeding artery and drainage veins.  Occlusion of the feeding artery with a balloon device is effective in decreasing intraoperative bleeding.  Abdominal total hysterectomy was performed as the surgical management of this uterine AVM.  Prophylactic endovascular balloon occlusion of the ipsilateral internal iliac artery reduced the amount of hemorrhage during surgery, although blood transfusion was needed in our patient.  In conclusion, preoperative embolosclerotherapy should be considered as a treatment option in patients with AVM present in a large uterine cervical myoma.
