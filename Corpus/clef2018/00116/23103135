Interpretation of lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 levels is influenced by cardiac disease, comorbidities, extension of atherosclerosis and treatments. Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) is an inflammatory biomarker secreted in the atherosclerotic plaque. Blood levels of Lp-PLA2 predict future cardiovascular events in patients with ischemic disease and heart failure. This association seems to be independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. The aims of our study were (1) to assess relationships between Lp-PLA2 levels, cardiac disease and treatments (2) to evaluate the association of Lp-PLA2 level with the severity of angiographic coronary artery disease (CAD) and the extracoronary atherosclerosis.Between December 2009 and June 2010, 494 subjects were recruited from a population scheduled for diagnostic coronary angiography. Routine clinical (age, gender, BMI and treatment), cardiac (echocardiography, coronarography, carotid ultrasonography) and biochemical parameters were recorded for all patients. Lp-PLA2 mass concentration was assessed in serum with a Plac®-test turbidimetric immunoassay. Control Lp-PLA2 values were specifically obtained in 61 healthy subjects aged 44.5 ± 17.6 years (range: 25 to 59 years) without known cardiovascular risk factors (diabetes, smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia) or cardiac treatment.In healthy controls, mean Lp-PLA2 level was 163 ± 43 μg/L (166 ± 45 μg/L in men and 159 ± 39 μg/L in women, non significant difference). In our cohort of 494 patients (69.8% men) aged 64.2 ± 16.7 years, the main etiologies of cardiomyopathies were ischemic (40%), valvular (22%), cardiac failure with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction (14%), infection (5%) and aortic aneurysm (7%). Mean Lp-PLA2 levels were 216 ± 17 μg/L. Lp-PLA2 correlated with age, BMI, current smoking, history of hypertension but not with diabetes and gender. The bivariate analysis showed a significant correlation between Lp-PLA2, and BMI (p=0.001) but no correlation with serum creatinine or NYHA status. A multivariate correlation showed that Lp-PLA2 was associated with total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and apoB (r=0.95, p<0.0001) but not with Lp(a). We observed that Lp-PLA2 was significantly associated with treatments such as statins and ACEi/ARA2 but not with β-blockers, antiaggregant drugs or diuretics. Lp-PLA2 levels were significantly higher in patients with CAD than in patients without CAD (223 ± 54 vs. 208 ± 52 μg/L, respectively p<0.007). Moreover, Lp-PLA2 levels were significantly higher in patients with the most extensive angiographic CAD [single (n=24)=215.2 ± 52 μg/LThis study clearly shows that interpretation of Lp-PLA2 levels needs a good assessment of cardiac parameters and treatments, especially statins and ACEi/ARA2. Lp-PLA2 levels are significantly associated with coronary heart disease and with the extension of extra coronary disease after adjustment for age and gender.
