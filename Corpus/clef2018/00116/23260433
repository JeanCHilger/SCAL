Tirone David valve-sparing aortic root replacement and cusp repair for bicuspid aortic valve disease. The durability of valve-sparing aortic root replacement with or without cusp repair in patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) disease is questioned. We analyzed the results of 75 patients with a BAV undergoing Tirone David reimplantation valve-sparing aortic root replacement.Average age was 45 ± 10 years 80% were maleActuarial survival was 99% ± 2% freedom from reoperation was 90% ± 5%, infection 98% ± 2%, and stroke 100% at 6 years. After initial improvement in degree of AR (P < .001), minor subclinical progression of AR was observed (P > .5)After David procedure and cusp repair in patients with a BAV, midterm clinical and valve function outcomes were favorable out to 6 years. More follow-up is required to determine long-term valve durability and the hazard of other clinically important late adverse events, including eventual reoperation, to beyond 10 years.
