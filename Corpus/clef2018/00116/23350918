Transcapsular arterial neovascularization of liver transplants increases the risk of intraoperative bleeding during retransplantation. Arterial neovascularization of liver grafts can be a source of significant blood loss during retransplantation. This study evaluated the effect of transcapsular arterial neovascularization on intraoperative blood loss during retransplantation and long-term follow-up. Eleven consecutive patients with transcapsular arterial neovascularization (seven male, four female nine children, two adults
