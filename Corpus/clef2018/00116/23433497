Volume estimation of the aortic sac after EVAR using 3-D ultrasound - a novel, accurate and promising technique. Volume estimation is more sensitive than diameter measurement for detection of aneurysm growth after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), but this has only been confirmed on three-dimensional, reconstructed computer tomography (3-D CT). The potential of 3-D ultrasound (3-D US) for volume estimation in EVAR surveillance is unknown.Prospective validation study comparing 3-D US with 3-D CT, using 3-D CT as the gold standard.From August 2011 to March 2012, 93 consecutive EVAR patients were enrolled and examined with both 3-D US and CT angiography (CTA). Image data were analysed in a mutual blinded setup using a 3-D interactive segmentation technique.The technical success rate of 3D-US was 98% (91/93). In 91 EVAR patients (F/M 10/81) eligible for further analysis, the mean maximum volume (SD) was 126 (58) ml using 3-D US and 128 (58) ml using 3-D CT. The mean difference was 1 ml (0.4%) and the limits of agreement were -14 to 16 ml (-11Volume estimation of the aortic sac after EVAR using 3-D US is a feasible and accurate method using 3-D CT as the gold standard.
