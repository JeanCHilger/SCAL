Should we start AAA screening in Finland?. Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are usually asymptomatic before rupture. Through ultrasound screening AAA can be found before rupture. In Europe England and Sweden have started one-time ultrasound screening for men at age 65. Many studies around Europe have shown that screening is cost-effective. In a recent Finnish study one-time screening for men at age 65 would be a more effective option than the current practice where no screening is offered. Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm among 65-year-old women would entail less additional costs but fewer life years gained than screening for men. Starting the screening would require additional resources in the Finnish health care system as compared to the current policy.
