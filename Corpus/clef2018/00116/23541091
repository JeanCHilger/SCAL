Surveillance of patients post-endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR). A web-based survey of practice in the UK. To evaluate the current practice of endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) surveillance amongst British Society of Interventional Radiologists (BSIR) members.A web-based survey (Surveymonkey.com) of BSIR members was performed from June 2011 to September 2011. Questions included who was responsible for organizing follow-up, techniques used in follow-up, and timing of follow-up imaging.The majority (46%) of follow-up is organized by radiologists. In the first year, 74% of imaging interactions involves the use of computed tomography (CT), with 40% of respondents using multiple phases. After the first year, ultrasound is utilized more frequently, usually with plain films. Most patients receive imaging at 1, 6, and 12 months, and thereafter most respondents plan on indefinite yearly follow-up.EVAR follow-up protocols in the past have been empirical rather than evidence based. The present survey shows the current range of protocols used in the UK. Despite the frequent use of CT in the first year post-EVAR, there does appear to be a trend towards using ultrasound after the first year of follow-up.
