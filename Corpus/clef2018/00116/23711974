Successful use of talc sclerodesis to control a persistent high-output groin seroma following endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Groin wound lymphatic complications after vascular procedures are accompanied by increased risk of infection, prolonged hospital stay, and greater patient morbidity. High-output groin seromas can be difficult to manage and refractory to established interventions. Although subcutaneous talc has been used to prevent seroma accumulation in other high-risk surgical fields, such as after axillary lymph node dissection, it has not been described in the context of vascular surgery. This article presents the first reported case of a persistent high-output groin seroma after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair managed successfully with intraoperative application of sterile talc.
