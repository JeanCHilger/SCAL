Acellular vascular grafts generated from collagen and elastin analogs. Tissue-engineered vascular grafts require long fabrication times, in part due to the requirement of cells from a variety of cell sources to produce a robust, load-bearing extracellular matrix. Herein, we propose a design strategy for the fabrication of tubular conduits comprising collagen fiber networks and elastin-like protein polymers to mimic native tissue structure and function. Dense fibrillar collagen networks exhibited an ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of 0.71±0.06 MPa, strain to failure of 37.1±2.2% and Young's modulus of 2.09±0.42 MPa, comparing favorably to a UTS and a Young's modulus for native blood vessels of 1.4-11.1 MPa and 1.5±0.3 MPa, respectively. Resilience, a measure of recovered energy during unloading of matrices, demonstrated that 58.9±4.4% of the energy was recovered during loading-unloading cycles. Rapid fabrication of multilayer tubular conduits with maintenance of native collagen ultrastructure was achieved with internal diameters ranging between 1 and 4mm. Compliance and burst pressures exceeded 2.7±0.3%/100 mmHg and 830±131 mmHg, respectively, with a significant reduction in observed platelet adherence as compared to expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE 6.8±0.05×10(5) vs. 62±0.05×10(5) platelets mm(-2), p<0.01). Using a rat aortic interposition model, early in vivo responses were evaluated at 2 weeks via Doppler ultrasound and CT angiography with immunohistochemistry confirming a limited early inflammatory response (n=8). Engineered collagen-elastin composites represent a promising strategy for fabricating synthetic tissues with defined extracellular matrix content, composition and architecture.
