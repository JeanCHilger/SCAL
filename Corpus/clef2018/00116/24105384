Ureteral injury after posterior lumbar discectomy with interbody screw fixation. We report a case of iatrogenic ureteral injury secondary to L5 laminectomy and microdiscectomy with L5-S1 bone graft with posterior lumbar interbodyfusion using presacral cancellous screw fixation, managed by initial ureteral stent placement and subsequent Boari bladder flap repair. A 33-year-old woman underwent L5 laminectomy and microdiscectomy with L5-S1 bone graft with posterior lumbar interbody fusion using presacral cancellous screw fixation. On postoperative day 10, she developed lower abdominal pain, vomiting and fever. Ultrasonogram and contrast-enhanced CT demonstrated a large pelvic urinoma secondary to a right lower ureteric injury. This was managed initially by ureteral stent placement and subsequent Boari bladder flap repair. Ureteral injury following spinal surgery is a rare surgical complication with significant morbidity and mortality. A high index of suspicion is essential for early appropriate management and renal salvage.
