First-in-man assessment of the InSeal VCD, a novel closure device for large puncture accesses. To demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of the novel InSeal VCD for the closure of large puncture holes following percutaneous structural interventions.Prospective, non-randomised, single-arm, single-centre study with a series of patients submitted to endovascular treatment of abdominal and thoracic aortic aneurysm as well as transcatheter aortic valve implantation in whom the InSeal VCD was used to close the access site. These patients were followed up for one year with clinical examination, ankle-brachial index and Doppler ultrasound. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of major vascular complications at the puncture site. From a total of nine patients screened, seven were selected to receive the InSeal VCD. Technical and therapeutic successes were achieved in all cases. The sheath profiles used in these procedures ranged from 18 Fr to 25 Fr. No major vascular complications were observed during the follow-up period. Average ankle-brachial index pre-intervention and at one-month follow-up were 0.85 and 0.82, respectively.The InSeal VCD was shown to be effective in achieving acute and chronic haemostasis after usage of higher profile endovascular devices in this study. These results translated into no clinical complications up to one-year clinical follow-up.
