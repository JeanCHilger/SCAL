Predictive markers of abdominal aortic stiffness measured by echo-tracking in subjects with varying insulin sensitivity. Arterial stiffness is influenced by advancing age and vascular disease and is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events and death. Using ultrasound measurements, arterial stiffness in a specific arterial segment can be assessed. The aim of this observational study was to explore the prospective and cross-sectional associations between arterial stiffness measured by ultrasound locally in the abdominal aorta and cardiovascular risk factors/markers including insulin resistance measured by the homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), lipids and abdominal obesity. This study includes 335 subjects from Malmö, Sweden, examined in 1991-1994 and again at follow-up in 1998-2000 (mean age 64 years, 42% men). Ultrasound measurement of the abdominal aorta was performed at follow-up investigation. In the female subgroup, there was a positive association between HOMA-IR at baseline and abdominal aortic stiffness at follow-up (β = 0.18, P = 0.03) and a negative association between high-density lipoprotein and aortic stiffness (β = -0.23, P = 0.005), independently of classical cardiovascular risk factors. These associations were not found among men. The results suggest a greater or different role of impaired glucose metabolism in the pathophysiology of arterial stiffness in women than in men.
