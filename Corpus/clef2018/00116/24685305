Laparoscopic management of obstructed partial duplex with Y ureteric configuration. An 11-year-old girl underwent a laparoscopic upper-to-lower moiety ureteropyelostomy for lower moiety pelviureteric junction obstruction associated with Y ureteric duplication. She presented with left flank pain and was noted to be hypertensive with microscopic haematuria on admission. An abdominal ultrasound scan revealed a duplex left kidney with gross lower moiety pelvicalyceal dilatation. A subsequent MAG-3 scan demonstrated reduced differential function in the left lower moiety. A laparoscopic transmesocolic approach confirmed a dilated lower moiety pelvis and revealed the Y ureteric duplication. An upper to lower moiety ureteropyelostomy and insertion of a JJ stent is described in the accompanying video. The child was discharged home on the second day post operation. Postoperative imaging showed good decompression and improved differential function. The child has been completely well and normotensive at 2 years' follow-up.
