Endovascular treatment of isolated abdominal aortic dissections: long-term results. To examine long-term survival and freedom from reintervention after endovascular treatment of patients with isolated abdominal aortic dissections (IAAD).A retrospective review was conducted of 21 patients (18 men mean age 72Â±18 years, range 34-90) with an IAAD who underwent endovascular treatment between January 2000 and December 2012. Fourteen patients had spontaneous abdominal dissections, while 7 dissections were iatrogenic in origin. Thirteen patients with symptomatic acute (n=9) or subacute (n=4) lesions underwent analgesic therapy and medical management of systolic blood pressure for at least 5 daysEarly (30-day) mortality was 0% no major adverse events occurred during hospitalization. Patients with co-existent AAA/PAU had complete exclusion of the aneurysm sac. The patient with an AUI graft suffered from an early stent-graft thrombosis in the abdominal aortaIn this series, long-term evaluation of endovascular IAAD treatment found no mortality, few complications, and rare need for secondary interventions.
