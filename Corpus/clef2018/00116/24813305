Large unruptured sinus of valsalva aneurysm dissecting into interventricular septum and presenting as a complex myocardial cystic mass. Unruptured aneurysm of sinus of Valsalva (SOV) is extremely rare. They may be asymptomatic and diagnosed incidentally or can present with either fatal outcome following rupture or manifest acutely with compression of surrounding structures. Dissection of unruptured aneurysm of left SOV into interventricular septum (IVS) and presenting as intramyocardial mass is not reported in the literature. We are reporting a case of 21-year-old man who was referred to us following a seizure episode and was incidentally diagnosed with aneurysm of left SOV dissecting into IVS. Multimodality imaging confirmed the diagnosis. He successfully underwent surgical repair and was asymptomatic during follow-up.
