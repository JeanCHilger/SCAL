Mycotic popliteal aneurysm rupture secondary to Campylobacter fetus. Mycotic aneurysms of the popliteal artery are uncommon. Popliteal aneurysms rarely rupture. The authors present the second reported case of popliteal artery rupture as a result of Campylobacter fetus infection. This report confirms the arterial destructive potential of C. fetus infection in a peripheral artery.An 85-year-old male who had previously undergone endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in 2007 presented with positive blood cultures for C. fetus. No endocarditis was detected. No periprosthetic fluid to suggest aortic endograft infection was present. During hospitalization for sepsis, he developed acute right knee pain and swelling. A 5.2-cm popliteal aneurysm, with contained rupture, was found on ultrasound and confirmed by computed tomography and angiography. Recommendations for treatment and a literature review are provided.This patient was successfully managed with total excision of the aneurysm via a posterior approach with reconstruction through a medial approach using autologous saphenous vein bypass. Culture-directed antibiotic therapy (6 weeks of intravenous ertapenem) to eradicate the pathogen completed the therapy. The patient is doing well at 18- month follow-up.Mycotic popliteal aneurysm associated with C. fetus is a rare but potentially fatal condition. Isolating C. fetus should alert the surgeon to the peripheral arterial destructive potential of this pathogen, as manifested by acute rupture in this patient. Traditional resection through a posterior approach and revascularization through noncontaminated tissue with culture-directed therapy are the treatments of choice.
