Ultrasonic screening for the detection of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Detection of aortic aneurysms before they rupture is imperative if the mortality rate from this disease is to be reduced. Although large aneurysms frequently are palpable, small aneurysms--especially in obese patients--are seldom recognized on physical examination. Ultrasound, which is noninvasive, relatively inexpensive, and nearly 100 per cent accurate in identifying the presence or absence of aneurysms, is well suited to screening. In high-risk populations (patients over the age of 50 with coronary artery or peripheral vascular disease), ultrasonic screening is probably cost-effective.
