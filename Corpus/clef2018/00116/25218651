Polytetrafluoroethylene covered stent placement for focal occlusive disease of the infrarenal aorta. Arterial insufficiency is rarely caused by isolated infrarenal aortic occlusive lesions. Endovascular treatment options include plain balloon angioplasty and bare metal stent placement. In this study the feasibility and efficacy of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) covered balloon expandable stents were evaluated.Consecutive patients from two centers were prospectively collected in a database and retrospectively analyzed. Results were evaluated by clinical examination, ankle-brachial indices (ABI), duplex ultrasound, and plain abdominal radiography.Thirty-six consecutive patients were treated between November 2008 and June 2013. Indication for treatment was Rutherford 3 (n = 29), 4 (n = 3), and 5 (n = 4). Technical success was always achieved and there were no distal embolizations or vessel wall ruptures. The median follow-up was 22 months (range 0-60). All patients improved clinically and the ABI increased significantly from 0.73 ± 0.18 to 1.01 ± 0.14 (p < .01). One patent covered stent was removed surgically because of infection. Primary patency rates were 100% at 1 and 2 years without stent fractures.The use of PTFE covered stents for the treatment of isolated infrarenal aortic occlusive disease is safe and very effective. Patency rates are excellent and complications including distal embolization and vessel wall rupture are extremely rare.
