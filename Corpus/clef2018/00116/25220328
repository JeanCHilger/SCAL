Endovascular interventions for managing vascular complication of renal transplantation. Renal transplantation is a well-established treatment for patients with end-stage renal disease. Although the procedure is commonly undertaken with a high rate of initial technical success, a low but significant risk of vascular complications can develop and ultimately threaten the transplanted kidney. Complications include transplant renal artery stenosis, extraparenchymal and intraparenchymal pseudoaneurysm and arteriovenous fistula formation, and stenosis of native iliac arteries due to aortoiliac occlusive disease. Historically, open surgical correction of these complications has been associated with high morbidity and the risk of graft loss. Endovascular approaches are better tolerated by renal transplantation patients and are used increasingly for management of vascular complications associated with kidney transplantation. We review the contemporary diagnosis and treatment of these complications using endovascular techniques.
