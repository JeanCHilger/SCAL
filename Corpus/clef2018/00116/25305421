Vascular disease prevalence and risk factors in a screened Korean male population. Vascular diseases, such as carotid artery stenosis (CAS), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), and peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAD) of the lower limb, are common in elderly men. These diseases have not been thoroughly reported in Eastern countries as well as in Western countries. We compare the prevalence rates in Korea with previous reports, and evaluate correlations between known risk factors and these conditions in this population.From November 2008 to December 2012, elderly men (≥65 years) were randomly referred from the Incheon Federation of the Korean Senior Citizens' Association, which is one of the major organizations representing retired individuals in Korea. CAS was defined as ≥50% of internal CAS, AAA was defined as ≥3 cm aortic diameter, and PAD of the lower limb was defined as an ankle brachial index ≤0.9.The average age was 72.14 ± 5.15 years. CAS was detected in 116 subjects (7.2%), AAA was detected in 52 subjects (3.2%), and PAD was detected in 79 subjects (4.9%). On multivariate analysis, octogenarian status and coronary artery disease were significantly associated with CAS and current smoking was significantly associated with PAD (P < 0.001).The Korean prevalence rates of CAS and PAD in this study are similar to previous reports. The prevalence of AAA in Korea is lower compared with western reports, but higher than previous Asian reports. It is presently necessary to conduct major clinical studies throughout Asian countries to prepare for a rapid increase in the prevalence of major vascular diseases in Asia.
