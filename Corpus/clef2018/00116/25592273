Potential of mesenchymal stem cell in stabilization of abdominal aortic aneurysm sac. In their origin, abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are related to an inflammatory reaction within the aortic wall, which can lead to weakness and degeneration of this structure. One of the most widely accepted treatment modalities for AAAs is the placement of stent grafts. Nevertheless, in some patients blood re-enters the aneurysm sac, creating so-called leaks, which constitute a renewed risk of rupture and death.This study explores the possibility of filling aneurysm sacs treated by endovascular aneurysm repair with adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) in a porcine model.We developed a porcine model using 22 animals by creating an artificial AAA made with a Dacron patch. AAAs were then treated with a coated stent that isolated the aneurysm sac, after which we introduced allogeneic ASC into the sac. Animals were followed-up for up to 3 mo. The experiment consisted of the aforementioned surgical procedure performed first, followed by computed tomography and echo-Doppler imaging during the follow-up, and finally, after sacrificing the animals, histologic analysis of tissue samples from the site of cell implantation by a blinded observer and the detection of implanted cells by immunofluorescence detection of the Y chromosome.Our findings demonstrate the survival of ASCs over the 3 mo after implantation and histologic changes associated with this treatment. Treated animals had less acute and chronic inflammation throughout the study period, and we observed increasing fibrosis of the aneurysm sac, no accumulation of calcium, and a regeneration of elastic fibers in the artery.The combination of endovascular aneurysm repair and cell therapy on AAAs has promising results for the stabilization of the sac, resulting in the generation of living tissue that can secure the stent graft and even showing some signs of wall regeneration. The therapeutic value of such cell-based therapy will require further investigation.
