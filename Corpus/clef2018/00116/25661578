Simultaneous carotid artery stenting and heart surgery: expanded experience of hybrid surgical procedures. The aim of this study was to evaluate 10-year results of same-day hybrid revascularization of concomitant carotid artery disease by stenting (CAS) and coronary artery disease by coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), later also applied to patients requiring CAS and other than coronary open heart cardiac surgery.One hundred thirty-two consecutive patients (70 ± 8 years, 102 men) underwent same-day CAS and CABG (group 1, n = 97) or other cardiac surgical procedures (aortic ± mitral valve surgery ± ascending aorta replacement ± CABG group 2, n = 35). In both groups aspirin (100 mg daily) was started 2 days before CAS and permanently continuedOverall in-hospital mortality was 3.8% (2.1% in group 1 versus 8.6% in group 2 p = 0.02Same-day hybrid approach appeared safe in terms of early and long-term results not only for CAS and isolated CABG but also for CAS and noncoronary isolated procedures. In complex cases, the rate of stroke and myocardial infarction seemed low in-hospital mortality, as expected, was higher. Long-term survival appeared similarly satisfactory, thus confirming the hybrid approach as a valid therapeutic option for all patients with significant internal carotid artery stenosis associated with coronary and other cardiac lesions, at least for noncomplex cases.
