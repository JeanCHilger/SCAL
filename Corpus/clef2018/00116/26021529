Technical and Clinical Success and Long-Term Durability of Endovascular Treatment for Atherosclerotic Aortic Arch Branch Origin Obstruction: Evaluation of 144 Procedures. Endovascular treatment of atherosclerotic obstruction of aortic arch branch origins (AABO) has largely replaced open surgery, but long-term outcome data are lacking. This study evaluated mid-term and long-term results of these procedures.Retrospective cohort study.Patients underwent endovascular treatment for symptomatic atherosclerotic stenosis of AABO between 1995 and 2012. Technical success was defined as uncomplicated revascularization and residual stenosis ≤30%. The primary end point was freedom from restenosis ≥50% on Duplex ultrasonography or magnetic resonance angiography. Secondary end points were freedom from target lesion revascularization or recurrent symptoms.144 lesions were treated in 114 patients (75 female mean age 66.3 years), by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in 20 patients and PTA and stent in 117 patients (brachiocephalic artery [BCA] 9/54Endovascular treatment of aortic arch branch origin obstruction is safe and efficacious in experienced hands and can be considered as the preferred treatment, with good mid-term durability. Recurrent symptomatic lesions can be treated safely by renewed endovascular means.
