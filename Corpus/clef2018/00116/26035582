Surgical treatment of a female patient with non-specific aortoarteritis. Presented herein is a case report of successful surgical treatment of a female patient with non-specific aortoarteritis. In 2004 she was endured single-stage simultaneous autovenous ileorenal prosthetic repair on the right and autovenous aortorenal prosthetic reconstruction on the left for critical stenosis of the left renal artery and occlusion of the right one. In 2007 she underwent balloon dilatation of the aorta for abdominal aortic stenosis with a good favourable therapeutic outcome. In 2013 due to lesions of the aortic arch branches she was subjected to endarterectomy from the common carotid artery on the left, autovenous carotid-subclavian shunting on the right with a favourable outcome. Presented herein are the results of check-up multislice CT-angiography (MSCT) 9 years after operation on renal arteries. Multislice CT-angiography and duplex scanning of aortic arch branches made it possible to choose an optimal surgical policy in this woman. Simultaneous endarterectomy from the common carotid artery on the left with autovenous carotid-subclavian shunting on the right in a patient with non-specific aortoarteritis was used by us for the first time. This operation made it possible to restore patency of the carotid artery and to use it as a donor artery for carotid-subclavian shunting in order to eliminate vertebral subclavian steal syndrome.
