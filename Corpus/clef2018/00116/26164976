Supravalvular aortic stenosis with and without coronary lesions in pediatrics. A Lebanese study. This study aims to analyze several parameters concerning the supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) in children such as age of diagnosis, place of residence, the existence of a metabolic disorder or dysmorphic syndrome and possible damage to the coronary ostia, the means of diagnosis and outcome of these patients.A large group of patients (2868) with congenital heart disease enrolled between 1 May 1999 and 30 April 2010 at the National Register of Pediatric and Congenital Heart Disease, Lebanese Society of Cardiology.SVAS were found in 14 patients (0.5%) aged 8.5 months to 15 years. The Williams Beuren syndrome was the most common etiology (6 cases) without ostial stenosis, asymptomatic and not treated, followed by forms without dysmorphic syndrome (5 cases) and without ostial stenosis, one patient was operated because of severe SVAS finally, 3 cases of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia treated differently: a patient had a successful liver transplantation at age of 4.5 years but has developed, despite the normalization of cholesterol level, a SVAS associated with severe ostial lesions 10 years after transplantation, another treated by coronary artery bypass graft surgery and the latter treated medically.SVAS is a very rare disease, but its discovery must lead to search for coronary lesions especially in presence of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. The ultrasound monitoring is mandatory and is designed to detect this anomaly and early coronary lesions. The slightest suspicion should carry out more extensive explorations to detect ostial stenosis.
