Intima-media complex thickness: preliminary workup of comparative evaluation of abdominal aorta and carotid artery of small-for-gestation-age term newborns and normal size term newborns. Increased intima-media thickness (IMT) has shown to be a good predictor of increased incidence of cardiovascular disease. The use of noninvasive measurement of abdominal aortic intima-media thickness (aIMT) and carotid artery intima-media thickness (cIMT) is an attractive modality to further explore and define possible intrauterine factors that may be associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis.The aim of this study was to compare intima-media thickness of abdominal aorta and carotid artery in small-for-gestation-age (SGA) term newborns with appropriate for gestation age (AGA or normal sized) term newborns.We measured the intima-media thickness of the abdominal aorta (aIMT) and carotid artery (cIMT) by high resolution ultrasonography of 50 SGA and 50 AGA term newborns.Mean aIMT and cIMT were significantly greaterin the SGA term newborns group as compared to AGA term newborns (0.54 +/- 0.06 mm and 0.44 +/- 0.04 mm in SGA term newborns vs. 0.50 +/- 0.04 mm and 0.40 +/- 0.04 mm in AGA term newborns P < 0.008 and P < 0.001, respectively). The significance was even more apparent after adjustment for birthweight. A negative correlation of aIMT and cIMT was seen with birthweight, Ponderal index, length and head circumference.SGA term newborns have significantly increased aortic and carotid intima-media thickness as compared to AGA term newborns. This might be associated with higher risk for atherosclerosis. Longitudinal studies are required to further enhance the possible correlation between birthweight and intima-media thickness in SGA babies.
