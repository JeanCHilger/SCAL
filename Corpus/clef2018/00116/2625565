Surgical treatment of the prosthetic valves in reoperation. Surgical treatment and problems in patients required reoperation for malfunctioning prosthetic valves are reviewed in our institute. The cinefluoroscopy and pulse doppler echocardiography were helpful for diagnosis of artificial valve dysfunction. In recent two decades valve replacement were performed in 382 cases and number of re-implanted valve were 469. Among them the cases of reoperation were 21 and reimplanted valves were 25 (5.6%) 4.7% in aortic, 5.0% in mitral, 6.7% in tricuspid position. Three cases of those patients had three operations. Main causes of reoperation were primary tissue failure in Carpentier-Edwards porcine xenograft (6 cases, 23%) and cloth wear in Starr-Edwards ball valve (9 cases, 38%) and thrombosis in St. Jude Medical bi-leaflet valve (3 cases, 15%). In most cases St. Jude Medical valve were chosen for the alternative prosthetic valve in reoperation. We applied IABP support to seven patients for severe low cardiac output syndrome after the operation and overall mortality was 24% in reoperation. It concluded that St. Jude Medical valve may be most reliable because of low incidence of postoperative complication in our institute.
