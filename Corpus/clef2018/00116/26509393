Initial results of the management of aortoiliac aneurysms with GORE® Excluder® Iliac Branched Endoprosthesis. We prospectively observed the outcomes of all patients (N.=15) with an aortoiliac and a common iliac artery aneurysm who were electively treated with the GORE® Excluder® Iliac Branched Endoprosthesis (IBE) with regard to clinical, anatomical and radiological results.We evaluated operative mortality, aneurysm rupture rate and aneurysm related mortality as well as conversion to open surgery, incidence of endoleak, rate of aneurysm migration, aneurysm enlargement, graft patency, reintervention rate and the clinical outcome. Postoperative follow-up included a computed tomography angiography (CTA) before discharge, clinical evaluation and Duplex ultrasound or CTA 3 weeks after the intervention and Duplex ultrasound every 3 months afterwards.Mean patient age was 79 years (range 61-83 years) f/m: 1/2The GORE® IBE provides a new and safe alternative for the management of complete endovascular repair of an extensive aortoiliac or common iliac aneurysm while maintaining pelvic blood flow in iliac branched devices. Due to the lower complexity if compared to previous endovascular or hybrid methods, it should be performed in every anatomically suitable case.
