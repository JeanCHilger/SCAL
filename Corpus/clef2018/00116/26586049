Predictive factors for increased aortic pulse wave velocity in renal transplant recipients and its relation to graft outcome. To evaluate aortic stiffness in renal transplant patients and to determine the correlation of renal insufficiency and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) with aortic pulse wave velocity (APWV), we studied 96 renal transplant patients followed-up at our center. We measured the APWV using transcutaneous Doppler flow recordings and the foot-to-foot method, and calculated the eGFR using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation. The study included 81 (84.4%) males and 15 (15.6%) females. The mean age of the patients was 37.84 ± 10.10 years. The mean duration of transplant was 47.90 ± 34.40 months. The eGFR of the patients ranged from 1 to 120 mL/min, with a mean GFR of 72.6 ± 23.2 mL/min. Sixty-seven (69.8%) patients had eGFR > 60 mL/min and hence had stages 1 and 2 chronic kidney disease (CKD), 27 (28.1%) patients had eGFR 30-60 mL/min and hence had stage 3 CKD and two (2.1%) patients had eGFR <30 mL/min and hence had stages 4 and 5 CKD. The APWV of the patients ranged from 4 to 14.2 m/s, with a mean of 7.49 ± 2.47 m/s. A significant inverse correlation was found between the APWV and eGFR (Pearson correlation coefficient, -0.427, P = 0.00). The mean APWV was significantly higher among patients with higher CKD stage, P = 0.004. We conclude that the APWV is related to the renal graft dysfunction as measured by eGFR. The poorer the renal function, the higher was the APWV. Determination of the APWV may be helpful in predicting the outcome in renal transplant recipients.
