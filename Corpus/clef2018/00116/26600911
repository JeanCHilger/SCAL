An unusual localization of retroperitoneal paraganglioma: a case report. Paragangliomas are rare tumors arising from extra-adrenal chromaffine tissues. The diagnosis of non-functional retroperitoneal paraganglioma and its surgical management can be difficult. We report a case of a retroperitoneal paragangliomaof an unusual localization that renders the surgery more challenging. A 40 year-old woman presented to our department with a four-month history of upper quadrant pain with no vomiting, no fever, nor jaundice. Physical examination was normal. Ultrasonography showed a retro duodenal homogenous mass and computed tomographyscan showed a well-circumscribed round mass of heterogeneous density, which was in close contact with the aorta and the left kidney vein. Laboratory tests were normal. The patient underwent surgical management. The surgical exploration found a retroperitoneal tumor that was encapsulated and showing intimate contact with the abdominal aorta. We performed a complete resection of the tumor. Histological examination of the surgical specimen revealed a paraganglioma. The post operative course was uneventful. Paragangliomas are rare tumors. They can be asymptomatic for a long time and thus be diagnosed at late stage. A follow-up of patients is then essential. Surgical treatment is the only radical treatment and should be performed even in paragangliomas in close contact with the great vessels.
