DSA and duplex sonography of aortic prostheses. In 95 patients with aortal grafts, DSA was compared with duplex ultrasonography. In 4 patients the graft was better visualized by means of angiography. Kinking, coiling, dilatations, pseudoaneurysms, stenoses, and occlusions could be sufficiently diagnosed with both methods. Marginal thrombosis and periprosthetic pathologies could only be found with ultrasonography. The ultrasonographic and angiographic examination techniques are described and the limitations of both methods discussed.
