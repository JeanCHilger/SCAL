Intraoperative ultrasonic imaging of the ascending aorta. Embolization of atherosclerotic material from the ascending aorta resulting from placement of cannulas or vascular clamps is a major cause of stroke during cardiac surgical procedures. In an effort to identify atherosclerotic disease of the ascending aorta which might predispose to embolization, intraoperative B-mode ultrasonography was performed in 50 patients. The aorta was imaged from the aortic annulus to the origin of the innominate artery in transverse and longitudinal views. The results were compared with visual and tactile examination of the aorta for the presence of atherosclerosis. Ultrasonic imaging demonstrated atherosclerotic disease in 29 patients (58%). Visual examination and palpation identified atherosclerosis in 12 patients (24%). The amount and location of plaque was sufficient to require a change in the site of arterial cannulation or the proximal vein graft anastomoses or the technique of cardiopulmonary perfusion in 12 of the 50 patients (24%). All 12 patients were 65 years of age or older. Palpation underestimates the presence of atherosclerotic disease in the ascending aorta. Intraoperative ultrasonography accurately identifies patients with atherosclerotic disease of the ascending aorta. This allows the surgeon to modify cannulation, perfusion, and operative techniques to reduce the risk of perioperative stroke due to the embolization of atherosclerotic debris from the ascending aorta.
