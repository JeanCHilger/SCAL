The assessment of pelvic circulation after internal iliac arterial reconstruction: a retrospective study of the treatment for vasculogenic impotence and hip claudication. The standard surgical treatment of vasculogenic impotence or hip claudication involves repairing vascular lesions, especially in the internal iliac arteries. It is difficult, however, to make a definite diagnosis or an accurate judgement of the therapeutic effects of this treatment due to the trouble in ruling out any other disorders. During the last five years, 19 patients with impotence and associated apparent internal iliac artery stenosis or occlusion and 2 patients with hip claudication, underwent internal iliac arterial reconstruction. The patients' ages ranged from 37 to 70 with a mean age of 63.7 and the main procedure performed in all patients was aorto-iliac to femoral bypass grafting, or abdominal aortic aneurysmectomy. A retrospective study revealed that 74 per cent of those treated regained penile erectile activity postoperatively, and that hip claudication disappeared completely in all cases. One of the patients received percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) for the treatment of vasculogenic impotence, after which his postoperative penile brachial pressure index (PBPI) improved, demonstrating a statistically significant difference compared to the preoperative value. Trans-anal Doppler measurement also proved useful in providing complication-free perioperative understanding of pelvic circulation.
