Ultrasound screening of the abdominal aorta in patients with intermittent claudication. The presence of abdominal aortic dilatations and aneurysms (AAA) among 372 patients (302 men and 70 women) who originally presented with intermittent claudication was studied. The cohort was analysed in two ways, first retrospectively from the date of diagnosis of intermittent claudication until 1st of August 1985 (mean follow-up time being 70 months), second those alive at that date and who had not been operated on were offered ultrasound screening of their aorta. Retrospectively nine male patients were found to have had an operation for an aneurysm, one because of a rupture. Of the 110 patients who died and had not had surgery, 88 (73 men, 15 women) were autopsied and AAA was found at autopsy in six males and one female. Two males died of rupture. Ultrasonographic screening of the abdominal aorta was performed in 183 patients (147 men and 36 women) and dilatation was found in 25 patients (24 men, 1 woman). In the male part of the total material (n = 257) there were 39 patients (15%) with aneurysm or dilatation. Male patients with AAA or dilated aortas were significantly heavier, with a lower ankle arm index and higher serum cholesterol values than patients without AAA or aortic dilatation.
