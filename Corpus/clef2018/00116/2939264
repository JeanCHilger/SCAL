Result of bypass grafting for upper limb ischemia. Bypass grafting in the treatment of upper extremity ischemia is required far less frequently than it is in the lower extremity. The present study was undertaken to evaluate functional results and long-term patency of such grafts. Between 1978 and 1984, 33 bypass grafts were performed to relieve hand and forearm ischemia in 27 patients. The indication for bypass was neglected trauma (violent or iatrogenic) in 12 cases, primary arteriopathy in nine patients, and vascular complications of thoracic outlet compression in six patients. A reversed saphenous vein graft was used in 22 cases, and polytetrafluoroethylene was used in the remaining 11 procedures. Proximal anastomoses were from the aortic arch (one), subclavian artery (five), axillary artery (11), carotid artery (seven), and brachial artery (nine). Distal reconstructions were to the subclavian (three), axillary (three), brachial (16), radial (four), ulnar (two), and interosseous (five) arteries. Complete pre- and postoperative Doppler pressure measurements were available in 19 cases and demonstrated a significant increase in forearm systemic pressure index, from 0.51 before bypass to 0.86 postoperatively (p less than 0.001). Finger systolic pressure measurement in 10 patients also showed a significant improvement after operation. Follow-up of 31 grafts from 6 to 72 months (mean, 35.5 months) revealed an overall patency rate of 73% at 2 years and 67% at 3 years. Similar to lower extremity revascularization, more proximal grafts fared better the 2-year patency rate was 83% for grafts at or above the brachial artery but only 53% for bypass distal to the brachial bifurcation. Major amputation was not required in any case, even after graft occlusion.
