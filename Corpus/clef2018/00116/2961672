An experimental and clinical study on the dissecting aortic aneurysm--usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging and the ultrasonic pulsed Doppler duplex system. In the treatment of dissecting aortic aneurysm, it is important to understand the exact conditions of the disease. For this purpose Aortography (AOG) and X-ray computerized tomography (CT) have been used. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and the ultrasonic pulsed Doppler duplex system are completely non-invasive and may be used instead of AOG and CT. Experimental aortic dissection was done surgically using modified Blanton's method in 8 mongrel dogs. MRI and the ultrasonic pulsed Doppler duplex system were used on these dogs before and after surgery which consisted of surgical closure of entry and insertion of Ivalon Sponge to false lumen. MRI patterns were classified into three: i.e., low, middle, and high intensity. The ultrasonic pulsed Doppler duplex system patterns were classified into four: i.e., normal flow, to and fro, turbulent flow and wall motion patterns respectively. These patterns of MRI and the ultrasonic pulsed Doppler duplex system were closely correlated to autopsy findings. These results indicated that MRI and the ultrasonic pulsed Doppler duplex system are useful to evaluate the changes of figures and hemodynamics of the false lumen. In the clinical study, MRI was performed on 26 patients of dissecting aortic aneurysm before and after surgery. These results were compared with those of AOG and CT. In the detection of the intimal flap, the main arterial branches, and the location of the entry and reentry, MRI was superior to CT and almost equal to AOG.
