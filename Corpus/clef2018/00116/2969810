Treatment of calcified aortic stenosis: surgery or percutaneous transluminal aortic valvuloplasty? A total of 546 patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) were retrospectively reviewed to assess the efficacy of percutaneous transluminal valvuloplasty (PTV) and valve replacement (VR). Of these, 490 underwent VR between 1968 and 1986 (mean age 62 +/- 12 years, 71.7% were in NYHA class III or IV), 68.8% received mechanical prostheses, and in 11.8% a bypass graft was associated. The operative mortality was 6.9% (4% since 1983). The mean follow-up was 57.6 months. The actuarial survival rate was 77% at five years, 60% at 10 years, and 40% at 15 years. Over 70 years of age, operative mortality was 6.2% since 1983, and the actuarial survival rate was 67.5% at five years. From February 1986 to May 1987, PTV was attempted in 56 patients and was effective in 52 patients (mean age 79 +/- 5 years, 93% in Class III or IV). Immediate mortality was 7.1%. The morbidity was due to tamponade (1.8%), myocardial infarction (3.6%), vascular trauma (5.3%), or cerebrovascular accident (9%). Forty three patients were followed after PTV (mean value 4.2 +/- 3, range 1-14 months): 12 patients (28%) died and 46% were functionally improved in NYHA Class II. PTV significantly improved the aortic valve area as shown by haemodynamics (0.49-0.75 cm2 P less than 0.0001) and these findings were corroborated by Doppler study (0.46-0.70 cm2, P less than 0.001). In conclusion, this series shows that surgery provides satisfactory results in AS with a low mortality and good long-term results, even in the elderly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
