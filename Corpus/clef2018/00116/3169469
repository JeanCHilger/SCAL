Doppler evaluation of the Sorin and Medtronic-Hall prostheses in the aortic position. Doppler characteristics of normally functioning tilting disk prostheses in aortic position were studied in 55 patients (30 Medtronic-Hall and 25 Sorin) whose valvular function was considered normal using clinical and echocardiographic evaluation. Peak gradients, mean gradients and effective orifice area were estimated for different sizes of prostheses. The peak gradient calculated from maximal aortic velocity was 27.3 +/- 11.1 mmHg in Sorin and 21.1 +/- 9.7 mmHg in Medtronic-Hall valves the mean gradients were 12.9 +/- 6.2 mmHg and 10.8 +/- 5.7 mmHg in Sorin and Medtronic-Hall valves respectively. The effective orifice area calculated by the continuity equation was 1.4 +/- 0.5 cm2 in Sorin and 1.5 +/- 0.57 cm2 in Medtronic-Hall prostheses
