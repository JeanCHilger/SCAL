Aneurysm of the abdominal aorta in an eighteen-month-old child. We report the case of an infected aneurysm of the abdominal aorta in a 18 month-old child, discovered by routine palpation of the abdomen during hospitalization for pneumonia. Ultrasonography and arteriography showed a 6 cm aneurysm of the abdominal aorta beginning distal to the renal arteries which occluded the right common iliac artery. The aneurysm was treated by interposing a 6 mm Gore-Tex graft between the infrarenal aorta and the aortic bifurcation. Pathologic examination of the aneurysmal wall demonstrated a leukocytic infiltrate and the presence of encapsulated Gram positive organisms. Arterial aneurysms are exceedingly rare in children. Their etiology is varied: infection, connective tissue disease, trauma, inflammatory arterial disease or other rare diseases such as tuberous sclerosis, neurofibromatosis, or Beh√ßet's disease.
