Ultrasound screening for clinically occult abdominal aortic aneurysm. In a review of the records of 74 patients who had undergone repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm at a community hospital between 1977 and 1983 we found that the aneurysm had been undiagnosed before rupture in 35% these patients had an operative death rate of 50%, whereas elective repair carried a death rate of 4%. The characteristic patient was an obese man over the age of 55 years with hypertension, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease or peripheral vascular disease. Ultrasound examination was performed in 45 patients with these characteristics, and six aneurysms were diagnosed. Either surgery or computed tomography confirmed the diagnosis. The rate of false-negative results was estimated by review of the charts of 100 men over the age of 55 years who had undergone abdominal ultrasonography for other indications: no undetected aneurysms were discovered over 3 years of follow-up. Routine screening in this high-risk group would improve the rate of diagnosis of this potentially fatal condition before rupture and offer the patient the lower mortality rate associated with elective surgery.
