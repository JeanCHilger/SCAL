Noninvasive Doppler color flow mapping for detection of anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery and for evaluation of surgical repair. Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery is a rare but important cause of congestive heart failure in infancy and of sudden death at all ages. Diagnosis is often missed when based solely on physical examination and noninvasive methods. A 4 year old patient is presented in whom mitral regurgitation was noted by a referring physician and an anomalous left coronary artery was found by Doppler color flow mapping upon referral and verified at cardiac catheterization. Doppler color flow mapping was also used intraoperatively using a gas-sterilized transducer to further clarify the hemodynamics and assess the surgical result. After creation of an intrapulmonary artery tunnel from the ostium of the left coronary artery to the aorta, anterograde coronary artery flow and absence of a residual left to right pulmonary artery shunt were verified during surgery by Doppler flow mapping. Postoperatively, residual mitral regurgitation and patency of the left coronary artery graft have been followed up serially by Doppler flow mapping. Therefore, Doppler color flow mapping is useful in the diagnosis and intraoperative and postoperative management of this important and potentially life-threatening abnormality.
