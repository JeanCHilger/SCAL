Degree of reversibility of left ventricular systolic dysfunction after aortic valve replacement for isolated aortic valve stenosis. To determine whether a low preoperative left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) returns to normal late after aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis, 42 patients with critical aortic stenosis (valve area 0.7 cm2 or less), LV systolic dysfunction (EF 0.45 or less), angiographically normal coronary arteries, and no other significant valvular disease were studied at 10 to 84 months (mean 41 +/- 21) postoperatively. All patients survived aortic valve replacement and were discharged clinically improved. There were 4 late deaths these patients were older (79 +/- 6 vs 64 +/- 13 years, p = 0.007) and had lower preoperative mean valve gradients (51 +/- 6 vs 68 +/- 23 mm Hg, p = 0.003) than late survivors. Of 23 survivors who returned for follow-up radionuclide angiography and Doppler echocardiography, 21 were asymptomatic. EF returned to normal (0.50 or more) in 14 patients (group 1) and remained low in 9 patients (group 2). Doppler peak prosthetic valve gradient was 24 +/- 8 mm Hg in group 1 and 25 +/- 10 mm Hg in group 2 (difference not significant). Six of the 9 patients in group 2 underwent early postoperative radionuclide imaging, and LVEF was normal in 4 (0.65 +/- 0.14 early vs 0.41 +/- 0.06 late, p = 0.02). Of 77 preoperative and intraoperative variables analyzed, only paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (0 of 14 vs 4 of 9, p = 0.01) distinguished group 1 from group 2. Thus, LVEF does not always normalize after aortic valve replacement for AS, implying impaired myocardial contractility.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
