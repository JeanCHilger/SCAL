Abdominal aortic aneurysm due to Salmonella. Apropos of a rupture case treated surgically with an in situ prosthesis. A patient with ruptured aneurysm of the infrarenal abdominal aorta was treated by reestablishing arterial continuity, by means of a prosthesis in situ, and has been followed up for 16 months. This type of lesion raises difficulties with respect to surgical strategy, conventional treatment consisting of total resection of sac with infrarenal ligature of abdominal aorta combined with revascularization by extra-anatomic bypass surgery. Results in the case reported were positive and demonstrate that the operation performed may be a valid alternative if, after effective long-term antibiotic therapy, findings on clinical, biologic and ultrasound follow-up reviews remain normal.
