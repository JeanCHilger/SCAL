Traumatic pseudoaneurysms of the abdominal aorta. The present report describes a patient with a traumatic pseudoaneurysm of the abdominal aorta and reviews the past literature. Traumatic aneurysms occur in a young patient population, and may present as late as 27 years after initial injury. Sonography and computed body tomograms (CBT) with contrast are especially useful screening tools. However, aortography is mandatory for complete preoperative evaluation. Aortic repair may require either suture aortorrhaphy, patch aortoplasty or graft replacement. Adequate exploration and repair at the time of initial injury will prevent pseudoaneurysm formation and the potential of delayed aortic rupture.
