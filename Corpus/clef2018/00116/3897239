Evaluation of non-invasive arteriography in the surgical treatment of abdominal aneurysms. The accuracy of information on abdominal aneurysms for surgical procedure was evaluated and a comparison was made between aortography and combinations with transvenous aortography and non-invasive diagnostic methods such as radionuclide angiography, ultrasonography and computerized tomography in 33 clinical cases who were diagnosed as abdominal aneurysms by physical examination. Combined examinations provided reliable information on the extent of aneurysm, the relationship of renal and common iliac arteries, mural thrombi, patency of distal arteries and the relationship with surrounding organs, and were superior to that provided by aortography alone.
