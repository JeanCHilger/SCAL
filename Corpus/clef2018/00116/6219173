Angioplasty of the arteries of the extremities. Early and mid-term results (up to 3 years) in 492 cases. Results of iliac, femoral and/or iliac artery percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (P.T.A.) in 492 cases are presented, and the latest technical improvements in the procedure reviewed. Short and medium-term results in iliac artery stenoses were excellent (98 and 96% respectively), obstructions in this region not being treated. The advantage of P.T.A. over surgery is the lack of exposure of patients to the risk of circulatory insufficiency. Very good results were obtained in stenosis of the distal femoral artery, the method being much less effective in cases of long thrombosis. The essential indications are all types of stenosis of limb arteries, while contraindications can be summarized as iliac artery obstructions (because of possible severe retroperitoneal hematomas) and massive atheromatous calcifications. Aortic and graft stenoses are particular indications. Complications are mainly hematomas and thromboses, but these can be reduced in incidence by increasing experience of radiologists in the use of P.T.A. and by improved selection of patients. Progress will also depend on improved control of anticoagulant and thrombolytic treatments. The question is raised as to the need to treat early claudication due to femoral artery stenosis following detection by the Doppler effect test. The essential argument in favor of P.T.A. is the simplicity and safety of the method to the compared reconstructive surgery, a method involving too high a risk.
