Assessment of valvular heart disease by Doppler echocardiography. Doppler echocardiography provides direct hemodynamic data that are often complementary to those demonstrated by M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiographic imaging. This relatively new noninvasive technique has a number of important uses in patients with valvular heart disease. In both adults and children, Doppler measures of peak flow velocity through a stenotic valve allow accurate prediction of the pressure gradient across the valve, and the technique has particular promise for screening patients with suspected aortic or pulmonic stenosis. In patients with mitral stenosis but parasternal short-axis images of limited quality, Doppler velocity measures can provide novel data about the pressure gradient and mitral orifice area. Doppler techniques can also provide direct evidence for or against the presence of valvular regurgitation, and several approaches allow clinically useful estimation of the extent of aortic, mitral, or tricuspid regurgitation. In patients with known disease of one cardiac valve, Doppler is accurate for evaluating the integrity of a second valve. Finally, Doppler techniques have great promise for defining the nature, and perhaps the severity, of suspected prosthetic valve malfunction. Hence, we believe that Doppler echocardiography should become a routine part of the noninvasive evaluation of patients with known or suspected valvular heart disease.
