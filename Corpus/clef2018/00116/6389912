Carotid involvement in aortic dissection diagnosed by duplex scanning. Symptomatic carotid dissection following repair of a proximal aortic arch dissection has been successfully diagnosed by noninvasive ultrasonic duplex scanning. Angiographic confirmation, follow-up examinations by duplex scanner, and conservative management with heparin anticoagulation and tight blood pressure control are discussed. The differing etiologies and potential neurologic complications following aortic root dissection vs. spontaneous cervical carotid dissection are considered with a review of the current literature. Although diagnosis can be achieved through arteriography, the combined modalities of duplex scanning allow evaluation of both anatomic and hemodynamic factors. Conservative therapy may prove the most appropriate mode of management in these neurologically unstable patients.
