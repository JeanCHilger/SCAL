Aneurysm of the subrenal abdominal aorta spontaneously rupturing into the inferior vena cava. The authors report a new case of spontaneous rupture of an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm into the inferior vena cava operated with a good haemodynamic result. However, the patient died of multiple postoperative complications and an associated left bronchopulmonary carcinoma. The following features are emphasised: the contribution of complementary investigations to the diagnosis of this condition: abdominal ultrasonography, aortography and above all, especially in future years, of digitised angiography the clinical importance of ischaemia of the descending colon and acute postoperative renal failure, the prevention of which should improve surgical results.
