Aorto-enteric and paraprosthetic fistulas. Apropos of 5 cases. Five cases of aorto-enteric fistula (AEF) are reported. The first case was a primary AEF from rupture of the infrarenal section of the abdominal aorta treated successfully by an obliteration and graft. The second patient had a primary AEF from rupture of an abdominal aorta aneurysm, complicated after an obliteration and graft of the primary AEF, requiring excision of the graft and an extra-anatomical shunt (EAS): healing following parenteral hypernutrition. The third case, a patient with a primary AEF from rupture of an aortic adventitial cyst in the left colon, died from septic complications. The fourth case died with heart rhythm disorders on the 4th day after resection and EAS for an aortic fistula. The fifth patient had a secondary AEF with cataclysmic digestive hemorrhage: excision of the graft with digestive closure and aortofemoral bypass did not prevent a fatal outcome on the 20 th day. Digestive hemorrhage and septic signs may be combined or occur as isolated complications. The most valid complementary investigation is fibroscopy, bacteriological culture of arterial blood distal to the prosthesis having an orientation value. Ultrasound, computed tomography or Gallium scintigraphy imaging may detect a retroperitoneal abscess. Effective treatment of all aneurysms can prevent primary AEF and avoidance of infection and interpositioning of viable tissue between duodenum and anastomotic line reduce the risk of secondary AEF. Maximum chances of success require aggressive surgery: aortic ligature excision of all septic material and duodenal closure or segmental digestive resection with discharge of proximal pocket. Lower limb ischemia is treated by insertion of an EAS.
