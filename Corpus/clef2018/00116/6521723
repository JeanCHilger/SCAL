Several factors influencing the male sexual function in patients with atherosclerotic disease. Patients with arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO, n = 58), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA, n = 27) and the combined disease (n = 4) were the subjects of this study. All patients were evaluated by retrograde aortography and questioned personally as to their present male sexual function. The penile and ankle systolic pressure index (PSPI and ASPI) of patients with ASO were measured using a Doppler device, but in the patients with AAA, only the PSPI was taken. Several factors relating to male sexual function, such as, age, PSPI, ASPI, sites of the arterial occlusion or dilatation, classification of the ischemic symptoms according to Fontaine's category, numbers of pulsations of the femoral artery, were statistically analysed. All of the patients with both diseases, 66 percent of those with ASO and 52 percent of those with AAA were impotent. In the patients with AAA, the PSPI of the potent group was not significantly higher than that of the impotent group however, in patients with ASO, the PSPI of the former group was significantly higher than that of the latter group. In the patients with ASO, a significant correlation between the PSPI and the ASPI (r = 0.49, p less than 0.01) was found. When a PSPI value (PSPI = 0,70) was chosen as a demarcation between the impotent group and the potent group, 84 percent of the patients with ASO were correctly classified. However, when the ASPI (ASPI = 0.45) was used, only 69 percent were properly classified.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
