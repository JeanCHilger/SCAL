Precise diagnosis of aortic anastomotic aneurysm by computed tomographic scan. False aneurysms that involve aortoprosthetic anastomoses may be difficult to diagnose prior to fatal rupture. We report a case in which a false aneurysm that developed six year after aortofemoral-graft insertion was accurately diagnosed by a computed tomographic (CT) scan after both ultrasonography and angiography had failed to make the diagnosis. The ability of CT scanning to demonstrate anastomotic aneurysms and accurately determine the presence of periaortic hemorrhage is discussed.
