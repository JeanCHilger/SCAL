Evaluation of aneurysms by computed tomography. It is possible to image a variety of anomalies and pathologic conditions of the vascular system by means of computed tomography (CT). Noninvasive preoperative evaluation of aneurysms frequently can best be accomplished by CT, often providing more usable information than angiograms or even ultrasound. The use of a "bolus" of contrast, with scans performed immediately following the injection, after an initial nonenhanced study, provides excellent definition of such lesions. In this report we relate our experience with CT in patients with aneurysms.
