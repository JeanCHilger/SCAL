Doppler echocardiographic characteristics of sinus of valsalva aneurysms. This study evaluated the efficacy of a comprehensive transthoracic Doppler echocardiographic examination for correct detection of SVA and its associated lesions of VSD and aortic insufficiency. A consecutive series of 36 patients was obtained all had surgical confirmation of the anatomic defects. The location of the SVA was correctly determined in 97% of patients, and the associated presence of a VSD was correctly determined in 79% of the studies. In the cases in which Doppler was available, all 11 patients with associated aortic insufficiency were detected. In this series 32 patients had right SVA, 3 had noncoronary sinus SVA, and 1 had a left SVA. Relative frequency of the rupture site location corresponded closely to that in previous necropsy studies. It is concluded that transthoracic Doppler echocardiography can correctly localize SVAs and most associated lesions.
