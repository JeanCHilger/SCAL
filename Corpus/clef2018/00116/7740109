Evaluation of the transplanted liver and postoperative complications. This article presents a brief review of posthepatic transplantation anatomy and a synopsis of the role of imaging in posthepatic transplantation complications. Screening ultrasonography is used to detect vascular stenosis or occlusion. T-tube cholangiography is used to detect biliary leak or obstruction. Thoughtful use of conventional radiographs, ultrasonography, CT, percutaneous cholangiography, and MR imaging for problem solving in detection and management of complications, such as abdominal fluid collections, can make the difference between graft survival or failure.
