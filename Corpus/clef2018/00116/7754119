Experimental use of duplex Doppler ultrasonography in the evaluation of intestinal motility in occlusive syndromes. Intestinal motility is currently evaluated by means of clinical, radiologic and electromanometric methods. Of late, US has allowed to visualize the intestinal loops and their movements directly assessing wall patterns and endoluminal contents, as well as the degree of distension of the ileal loops its diagnostic value is in fact well established in the study of such specific diseases of the GI tract as inflammatory conditions and neoplasms. On the contrary, the use of duplex-Doppler US to investigate bowel motility is quite new. We used duplex-Doppler US to evaluate intestinal peristalsis in 37 patients presenting with acute abdominal pain (15 patients with early mechanical obstruction
