Hemodynamic criteria of prognostication of the outcome in revascularization of the lower limbs in severe ischemia. Experience of surgical treatment of 166 patients with severe lower limbs ischemia is summarized. The parameters of regional hemodynamics got with the help of ultrasound dopplerography, electro-magnetic flowmetry, percutaneous pO2 monitoring in the foot skin and registration of peripheral resistance of artery in distal anastomosis zone were used for prognostication of the vascular transplant function while aorto-femoral and femoro-popliteal segments reconstruction. The choice of surgical procedure tactics in accordance with prognosticated outcome permitted to lower the prevalence of an early postoperative complications from 17 to 8.4%.
