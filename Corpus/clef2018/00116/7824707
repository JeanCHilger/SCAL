Thoracic aortic dissection: diagnosis with transesophageal echocardiography versus MR imaging. To compare transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the diagnosis of dissection of the thoracic aorta.Thirty-one consecutive patients with clinically suspected aortic dissection and 10 postoperative patients underwent transesophageal color Doppler echocardiography and MR imaging. Imaging results were compared at independent double-blind readings. Final diagnosis was obtained from consensual review of all corroborative studies.MR imaging depicted the intimal flap in 95% of aortic dissections TEE, in 86% (P < .05). In surgical patients, the sensitivity of MR in detection of residual dissection was 100% versus 86% with TEE (P < .05). The inferior extent of the dissected lumen was seen only with MR imaging. False-positive results occurred in two cases with TEE and in one with MR imaging.MR imaging is superior to TEE in the evaluation and follow-up of dissection of the thoracic aorta. Because the availability of MR is limited, however, TEE should remain the standard modality for diagnosis.
