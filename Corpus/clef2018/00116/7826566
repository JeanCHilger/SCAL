Noninvasive quantitative evaluation of early atherosclerosis and the effect of monatepil, a new antihypertensive agent. An interim report. In two studies on the same group of patients we evaluated noninvasive methods of assessing atherosclerosis and determined the effect of the new calcium channel-blocking agent monatepil on the progression of early atherosclerosis in humans. Computed tomography (CT) of the lower abdominal aorta and ultrasonography of the carotid arteries were used as noninvasive methods to determine the extent of atherosclerosis. To evaluate the CT images, we developed a new medical image analysis program. This enabled aortic calcification volume (ACV) to be quantified using plain CT images, and aortic wall volume (AWV) and aortic wall and calcification volume (AWCV) to be quantified from contrast CT images. Interobserver coefficients of variation of ACV, AWV, and AWCV (n = 8) were 4.7, 2.4, and 5.0%, respectively. In the monatepil study, the effect of the drug on serum lipid profiles was evaluated. Preliminary results show that shortly after monatepil administration, total serum cholesterol levels decreased significantly from 253.8 +/- 35.6 to 244.8 +/- 38.6 mg/dL (P < .009) and triglyceride levels tended to decrease. A positive correlation between the change in total cholesterol and changes in mean platelet volume was found (P = .028). Fasting immunoreactive insulin levels decreased in the four patients in which they were determined. Although this is a preliminary study, results indicate that CT of the lower abdominal aorta in combination with our new analysis program may be a precise, reproducible means of assessing early atherosclerosis. We have also shown that monatepil significantly decreases total cholesterol levels. However, the long-term effects of monatepil on the progression of atherosclerosis remain to be determined.
