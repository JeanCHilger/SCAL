Abdominal aortic aneurysm expansion rate: effect of size and beta-adrenergic blockade. The purpose of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) expansion may be slowed by beta-adrenergic antagonists.One hundred twenty-one patients with infrarenal AAA were monitored with serial aortic ultrasound examinations. Eighty-three patients received no beta-blockers (group I), and 38 patients received beta-blockers (group II). Values are expressed as mean +/- SD.The mean follow-up was 43 +/- 29 months with 5.5 +/- 3.4 ultrasound examinations per patient. The expansion rate among all AAA was 0.38 +/- 0.44 cm/yr. Large aneurysms (> or = 5 cm) expanded significantly faster than small aneurysms (p = 0.02) in patients not treated with beta-blockers. Among patients with large AAA, those receiving beta-blockers had a significantly reduced mean expansion rate 0.36 +/- 0.20 versus 0.68 +/- 0.64 cm/yr, (p < 0.05). Although rupture rates were lower in group I (5%) versus group II (13%), this difference was not statistically significant. Thirty-four patients in a poor-risk category with AAA were monitored greater than 5 cm in diameter. Ten of these AAA ruptured. The mean expansion rate was significantly greater in those patients with ruptured AAA versus those patients with AAA that did not ruptureIn patients not undergoing beta-blocker therapy, large AAA expand at a significantly greater rate than smaller AAA. Large aneurysms that rupture show more rapid expansion than those AAA that do not rupture. We have demonstrated a significantly reduced rate of expansion of large AAA in patients receiving beta-blockade.
