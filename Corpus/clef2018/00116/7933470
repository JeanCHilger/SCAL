Effect of pirenzepine on gastric mucosal blood flow in patients after cardiac surgery. Effect of pirenzepine on gastric mucosal blood flow (GMBF) in adult patients after coronary artery bypass grafting and mitral and aortic valve replacement was evaluated by using endoscopic laser-Doppler velocimetry. Heart rate, blood pressure and cardiac output increased temporarily after intravenous administration of pirenzepine 20 mg. GMBF also increased with these hemodynamic changes. However, GMBF remained significantly higher even after the decrease of cardiac output. Therefore, the increase in GMBF, which might be due in part to increase in cardiac output, could be explained by pirenzepine's own effect on gastric mucosa. Since the GMBF is one of the most important gastric mucosal defensive factors, pirenzepine may be useful in preventing acute gastric mucosal lesions in patients with low cardiac output.
