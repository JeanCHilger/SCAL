Thrombolytic therapy for prosthetic cardiac valve thrombosis. During 1992-93 12 patients (5 males, 7 females) with thrombosed prosthetic cardiac valves were treated with streptokinase on 13 occasions (one patient with prosthetic tricuspid valve had two thrombotic episodes). Their age ranged from 14 to 52 years (median 39). Two valves were in aortic position, six in mitral and four in tricuspid position. Eight were Bjork-Shiley prosthesis, three were Medtronic Hall valves and one was a St. Jude Valve. Timing of prosthetic valve thrombosis ranged from 3 months to 12 years after valve replacement surgery. Duration of symptoms due to valve thrombosis ranged from 1-4 months with tricuspid valve thrombosis and 1-14 days with left sided valve thrombosis. Five were in functional class II and four each were in functional class III and class IV. All patients were evaluated by echo Doppler and cine fluoroscopy. Loading dose of streptokinase was 2.5 lakh units in 4 patients and 1 lakh units in 9 patients. Maintenance infusion was at 1000 units/Kg/hour in 11 patients and 1 lakh units/hour in 2 patients. Duration of streptokinase infusion ranged from 3 hr to 38 hr. Thrombolytic therapy was successful (clinical, echo Doppler and fluoroscopy) in 12 out of 13 cases (92%). It was unsuccessful in a patient with valve at tricuspid position in whom infusion had to be stopped after 24 hour due to bleeding gums. One patient developed intracerebral bleed and expired. In conclusion streptokinase therapy is useful for prosthetic cardiac valve thrombosis.
