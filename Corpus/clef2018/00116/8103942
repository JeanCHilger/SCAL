Takayasu arteritis: initial and long-term follow-up in 16 patients after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta. To analyze results of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) for stenosis of the descending thoracic and/or abdominal aorta caused by Takayasu arteritis (TA).Subjects were 16 patients (12 female and four male, aged 6-46 years) with symptoms of hypertension or severe bilateral lower limb claudication. Total aortography revealed stenotic lesions in the descending thoracic aorta in five, in the abdominal aorta in 10, and in both vessels in one patient. Involvement of arch vessels in four patients and of the renal artery in four patients was also noted. Double-balloon angioplasty was performed in eight patients.Initial technical and clinical success was 100%. The maximum follow-up period was 52 months (mean, 21 months 2 weeks). Ankle-brachial index as determined with Doppler ultrasound improved considerably in 10 patients. Three patients had symptoms of restenosis during follow-up. Cumulative patency rate by life-table analysis was 67%.PTA has a definite role in the management of TA in view of its procedural simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and results compared with surgical revascularization procedures.
