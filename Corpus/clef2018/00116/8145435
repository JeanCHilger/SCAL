The diagnosis of false aneurysms of the proximal anastomoses after aortofemoral reconstructive operations. The paper deals with the diagnostic aspects of false aneurysms of proximal anastomosis of prostheses with the aorta on the basis of examination of 9 patients aged 3-65 years after aortofemoral reconstructive operations. The periods of the occurrence of false aneurysms were 2 weeks to 6 years. The causes of anastomosis aneurysms: infection in 3 patients, endarterectomy from the aorta at the site of applied anastomosis in 1 patient, progressive underlying disease in 2 and ill-grade suturing material (silk). The cause of the disease could not be established in 2 patients. The authors provide strong evidence for a high informative value of various examinations, including ultrasound echo scanning, computer tomography, radioopaque aortography. They also emphasize a great practical value of using the algorithm of microbial analysis of blood, urine, and tissue of false aneurysm for confirming its infections.
