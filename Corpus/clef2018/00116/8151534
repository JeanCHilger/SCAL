Imaging of the renal transplant. Radiological methods. Ultrasound examination with morphological sonography and color flow imaging is now considered as the main technique for the follow-up of renal transplants. Morphology of the graft, and quality of perfusion can be assessed non invasively with this technique. Indications of IV pyelography decreased considerably in many centers. CT can help in characterizing intra-abdominal collections. MR will probably play a major role in the future allowing the graft itself, the perirenal space, and the intrarenal vessels to be studied by means of MR-angiography techniques.
