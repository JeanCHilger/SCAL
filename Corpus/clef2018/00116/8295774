Surgical treatment of an unusual anomaly of the subclavian artery. Surgical treatment of an unusual abnormality of the subclavian artery. The author presents a case of a 36 year-old female admitted with complaints of weakness of the right hand. Doppler pressure on the right and left arms was 100 mmHg and 140 mmHg respectively. Arteriography of the right subclavian artery showed a 6 cm-long tortuous area with a significantly narrowed (average 61%, maximum 75%) lumen. Other major arteries originating form the aorta did not exhibit pathological alterations. At surgery an 8 mm bore Goretex prosthesis was centrally anastomosed end-to-side to the common carotid artery, and the narrowed subclavian artery was ligated under the branching of the vertebral artery. A pedunculated end-to-end anastomosis was performed with the subclavian artery. The patient was released complaint-free. After a 4-year follow-up period the radial artery is palpable, the pressure in both extremities shows no alterations. The described pathology is regarded a congenital vascular alteration, which has never been described in the literature.
