The diagnosis of false aneurysms of the distal anastomoses after reconstructive operations in the aortofemoral area. Diagnostic aspects for false aneurysms of distal anastomoses between the prostheses and femoral arteries were studied by examining 31 patients aged 25 to 75 years who had undergone aortofemoral reconstructive operations. The cause of primary operations was atherosclerotic occlusive lesions of the arteries in 26 (83.8%) patients, non-specific aortoarteritis in 3 (9.6%) and injury in 2 (6.6%) patients. All the patients had previously undergone reconstructive operations on the aortofemoral area. The site of false aneurysms was the following: the common iliac artery in 3, the common femoral artery in 41 and the superficial femoral artery in 1 patient. Various techniques, such as ultrasonic and radiopaque aortographies were found to be of high informative value. The hemodynamic significance of false anastomotic aneurysms that can deteriorate regional circulation in the lower extremity was proved.
