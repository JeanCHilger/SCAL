2D-time-of-flight MR angiography in the diagnosis of abdominal aorta aneurysms. In abdominal aortic aneurysm ultrasonography, contrast-enhanced CT, and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) are the preoperative diagnostic methods of choice accepted today. It was the goal of this study to evaluate time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in comparison with other radiographic procedures in different types of aneurysms. In 24 patients with proven aortic aneurysm, projection angiograms (MIP algorithm) of the abdominal aorta and pelvic arteries were performed using two-dimensional gradient echo multi slice sequence (FLASH, TE/TR = 10/51 ms three slices
