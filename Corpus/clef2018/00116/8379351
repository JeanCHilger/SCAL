Imaging of aneurysms and dissections of the aorta. Part 1--Aneurysms of the abdominal aorta. The authors review the main imaging findings of aneurysms and dissections of the aorta. Based on the experience and imaging techniques available in their institution (Conventional Radiology, Sonography and Computed Tomography), they try to make a decision tree of radiologic procedures in ambulatory and emergency patients. Nowadays, in the majority of situations, these techniques allow the Radiologist to make the correct diagnosis, detect the complications and evaluate the patients in the pre and post-surgical phases. Other imaging techniques not available in their institution, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Aortography, will be mentioned in view of their usefulness in some specific situations.
