Rapidly growing mural thrombus in an abdominal aortic aneurysm. While mural thrombus accompanied by an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is not rare, the growth rate of such a thrombus has not yet been adequately documented. We present here a very rare case of a 62-year-old female patient with an AAA in whom the mural thrombus in the aneurysm grew very rapidly over a short period. We could follow the growth of the mural thrombus in the AAA by two-dimensional (2-D) abdominal echography. Patients with an AAA must be closely monitored by this technique which is able to detect the presence of the thrombus and allow evaluation of its growth.
