Preliminary observations on the use of the Palmaz stent in the distal portion of the abdominal aorta. The opportunities to avoid surgical treatment of distal abdominal aortic occlusive disease are expanding because of the proliferation in catheter-based techniques. Since January 1990, 24 symptomatic patients with distal abdominal disorders have been treated percutaneously with balloon angioplasty and intraluminal stenting. A total of 38 Palmaz stents were deployed at distal abdominal aortic sites 21 additional iliac stents were implanted. After the procedure all patients improved clinically, and 83% (21/24) improved by objective measurement (average ABI 0.93 +/- 0.21). Three access-related complications occurred (two hematomas, one thrombus), but no complications were related to the stents. At up to 29 months of follow-up (average 10.3 +/- 6.7 months), clinical improvement persists in all patients (average ABI 0.93 +/- 0.22). In 11 patients eligible for follow-up aortography, all aortic stents are patent without evidence of restenosis. With the low likelihood for restenosis in the abdominal aorta, the long-term outcome of aortic stenting looks promising and may equal or surpass that found in the iliac region.
