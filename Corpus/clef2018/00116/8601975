Ten-year experience with the Carpentier-Edwards pericardial xenograft in the tricuspid position. We reviewed the cases of 66 patients who underwent 67 tricuspid valve replacements with Carpentier-Edwards pericardial xenografts between April 1985 and January 1994. Average patient age at time of operation was 52 years (range 8 to 71 years). Concomitant mitral or aortic valve replacements were performed in 46 patients. There were 10 operative deaths and 6 late deaths. Actuarial survival at 9 years was 75.4% +/- 5.7%. Prosthetic valve endocarditis occurred twice in one patient. Reoperations for tricuspid regurgitation and for concomitant procedures (maze operation and repair for leak of the mitral prosthesis) were performed in two patients. In both cases, examination of the explanted prostheses showed that the tricuspid regurgitation was the result of nonstructural dysfunction caused by fibrous pannus formation on the cusps of the ventricular side. Among the survivors, 47 patients (92%) were in functional class I or II. Prosthetic valve function was studied by color Doppler echocardiography. Among 38 patients, tricuspid regurgitation more than grade 3/4 or transprosthetic gradient more than 5 mm Hg was found in 11. One patient had right heart failure and the others had no symptoms. In 10 years of experience with the Carpentier-Edwards pericardial xenograft, mortality and morbidity after tricuspid valve replacement were satisfactory. Echocardiographic examination revealed subclinical prosthetic dysfunction in 35% of patients who were followed up for longer than 5 years, however, and we believe that these patients should receive careful follow-up.
