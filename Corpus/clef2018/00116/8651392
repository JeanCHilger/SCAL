Medium aperture meso-caval shunts reliably prevent recurrent variceal hemorrhages. Objectives of partial medium aperture mesocaval shunts (MCS) include reduction of portal hypertension to prevent recurrent variceal hemorrhage, preservation of portal flow through liver while maintaining an intact porta hepatis to facilitate a future liver transplant (OLTx).Fifteen patients were retrospectively analyzed to review the indications for the procedure, its short- and long-term complications as well as patency and functional status of the shunt. They were followed for a period of 21 months.The perioperative and long-term mortality rate was 0%. Rebleeding rate perioperatively and in follow-up was 0%. Early shunt nonfunction was 13% and post-shunt encephalopathy (PSE) was 20%. The encephalopathy was grade I to II and controlled medically. Abdominal ultrasound and Doppler confirmed 13 patent shunts (2 patients did not agree to ultrasound) with preserved hepatopetal flow in 10.Medium aperture MCS utilizing ringed polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts safely and reliably prevent recurrent variceal hemorrhage. Encephalopathy is infrequent and mild. This technique preserves the portal venous anatomy making a future OLTx technically easier.
