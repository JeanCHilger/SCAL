Results of endoluminal grafting in an experimental aortic aneurysm model. We studied the impact of an endoluminally placed stented aortic graft on the geometry of a surgically created abdominal aortic dilation (AAD) in nonatherosclerotic mongrel dogs. Patulous iliac vein patch infrarenal aortoplasty produced a fusiform AAD, doubling the aorta diameter. Lumbar and mesenteric aortic tributaries were preserved and no mural thrombus formed. AADs created in 23 dogs were endoluminally excluded through transfemoral placement of a thin-wall Dacron graft 4 +/- 2 months later. Balloon-expandable stents were used to anchor each end of the graft to the aorta. The graft was crimped radially in its body and longitudinally at its ends to provide longitudinal and radial expandability in these respective zones. Serial color duplex, angiography, and direct caliper measurements were made. Before graft placement, a 19% +/- 11% diameter growth was observed. At graft placement, flow arrest immediately occurred in the space between the graft and the AAD intima in all cases. Although microscopic recanalization of the thrombus in this space was seen at sacrifice 6 and 12 months later, no macroscopic duplex flow was imaged. A 10% +/- 11% reduction in AAD diameter was measured at 6 months (p < 0.001), with no further reduction at 12 months. Graft dimensions remained stable. No anastomotic leaks developed. AAD growth stopped during the first year after effective endoluminal exclusion in normotensive dogs despite patent side branches (< 1.5 mm internal diameter) and no mural thrombus at the time of graft placement. Whether microscopic recanalization of the thrombus that forms outside the graft has an impact after 1 year remains to be seen.
