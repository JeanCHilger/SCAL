Three-dimensional transabdominal ultrasound identification of aortic plaque. Tree-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction of acquired tomographic images in adults has recently been described. With an adaptation of this technique, we performed 3-D reconstruction of transabdominal images of the abdominal aorta to test the hypotheses that 3-D reconstruction of the abdominal aorta is feasible and that 3-D images have incremental value over 2-D in the detection of atheromatous plaque. Twenty-one patients undergoing contrast aortography (Aogram) for clinical indications (1 abdominal aorta (AA) aneurysm, 5 peripheral vascular disease, 1 renal artery stenosis, 14 renal donors) were studied using a 5-MHz annular array probe fitted to a mechanical registration device. In 13 of 21 patients, adequate 2-D ultrasound slices were acquired around a 180 degrees rotation and stored as a volumetric data set using a dedicated computer and 3-D images were reconstructed off-line. Three-dimensional and planar images were blindly compared with Aograms using the following scale: grade 1, normal grade 2, increased echodensity of the intimal surface
