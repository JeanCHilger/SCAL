Circulatory support with Hemopump in cardiogenic shock secondary to papillary muscle rupture. A 71-year-old woman submitted to multiple coronary artery bypass grafts suddenly developed in the third postoperatory day cardiogenic shock. Transesophageal echocardiography examination and color Doppler showed prolapse of the anterior mitral valve leaflet and detached anterolateral papillary muscle in the left atrial cavity with severe mitral valve regurgitation and increased left ventricular wall kynesis. Maximal inotropic and vasodilator support was not effective and a mechanical circulatory assistance was deemed necessary awaiting for mitral valve replacement not performed on emergency for unavailability of operatory rooms. Hemopump pump-cannula assembly was introduced through a femoral graft and the cannula was advanced in the aorta and positioned in the left ventricle across the aortic valve. Pump rate was set at the maximal speed and as an immediate result, mean arterial pressure increased and mean pulmonary pressure decreased. Global cardiac output during 190 min of assistance was 3.48 l/min at a mean arterial pressure of 81 mmHg. The Hemopump provided 3 l/min of flow with an effective left ventricle unloading. The patient subsequently underwent mitral valve replacement and her postoperative outcome was uneventful and free from complications.
