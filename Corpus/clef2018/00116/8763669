Percutaneous treatment of iliac aneurysms with endovascular stented grafts. Two cases of iliac aneurysms treated percutaneously by endovascular stented graft are reported. The initial radiographic evaluation included arteriography and computed tomography with helical acquisition and three dimensional reconstruction. This enabled analysis of the flow path, the extent of the wall thrombus, the choice of stent graft's size. The procedure of implantation was technically trouble free. The post-procedure arteriography and 3D CT demonstrated occlusion of the aneurysm and restauration of a normal flow path. The three, six and twelve month check-ups confirm the good results. In weakened patients or those not requiring aorto-iliac surgery, percutaneous treatment of iliac aneurysm can be carried out easily. The contribution of 3D CT is essential in assessing the endo- and extra-luminal characteristics of aneurysm for indicating the percutaneous route and selecting size of the stented graft.
