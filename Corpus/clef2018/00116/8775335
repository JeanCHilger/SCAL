Intraoperative epiaortic ultrasound during cardiac surgery. Recent evidence suggests that the incidence of stroke during cardiac surgery may be reduced by using intraoperative epiaortic ultrasound (IEU) to detect ascending aortic atherosclerosis (AAA). To better define the role of this modality, IEU was performed in 89 patients during elective cardiac procedures.The ascending aorta and proximal arch were divided into four segments that were graded (0 to 2) on the extent of disease both by palpation and IEU. A patient score (range 0 to 8) was determined for each modality by summing the segmental scores. Operative plan was determined in part by IEU findings. Preoperative variables were evaluated for associated risk of AAA. Palpation and IEU scores were compared for their ability to identify AAA.Operative technique was modified to avoid AAA in ten (11.2%) patients (mean age 68.3 +/- 2.2 years mean IEU score = 4.40 +/- 0.40). Stroke occurred in two patients (2.2%), one whose operation was modified to avoid severe AAA and another who had minimal AAA. Mean IEU scores were significantly higher for patients > or = 65 years compared with younger patients (1.35 +/- 0.26 vs 0.66 +/- 0.21These data suggest that AAA may be more severe in older patients and smokers. Aortic palpation may not identify mild AAA. IEU can confirm and clearly define both the extent and distribution of suspected AAA and is useful for determining optimal operative strategy in patients with aortic disease.
