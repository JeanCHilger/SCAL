The profunda femoris-popliteal artery bypass. The profunda femoris artery can be used for the origin of a femoropopliteal bypass in cases of previous aorto femoral bypass graft, short saphenous vein, and other less common conditions that render the common femoral artery unsuitable for proximal anastomosis. Fourteen profunda-popliteal bypass procedures were performed in 12 patients between 1973 and 1976. The indications for surgery were incapacitating claudication in seven, and rest pain or tissue necrosis in five patients. Electromagnetic flow measurements at operation in ten patients indicated a mean graft blood flow of 146 +/- 51 ml/min. The mean Doppler ankle/wrist pressure ratio improved from 0.48 +/- 0.11 preoperatively to 0.87 +/- 0.14 postoperatively, while the plethysmographic mean pulse volume increased from 1.1 +/- 0.6 microliter to 2.4 +/- 0.4 microliter. Thirteen of the 14 grafts remain patient at one to three years' follow-up. The profunda-popiteal bypass is an effective alternative to standard femoropopliteal bypass in cases where the common femoral artery is not available for proximal graft anastomosis.
