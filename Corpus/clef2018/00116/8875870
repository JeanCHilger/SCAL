Preoperative assessment of the portal vein and hepatic artery in children with end-stage liver disease: is selective angiography still necessary? Selective angiography involves increased risk for children and may cause vascular complications. The aim of this study was to determine whether selective angiography is still necessary for viewing the portal vein and hepatic artery.Doppler ultrasound, abdominal aortography, and selective angiography were performed and interpreted independently in 62 children (median age = 1 year 3 months), with end-stage liver disease, who were candidates for orthotopic liver transplantation.Selective angiography agreed with the Doppler ultrasound findings of patency, flow direction, and diameter of the extrahepatic portal vein in 84%, 73%, and 79% of the children, respectively. Important additional information was obtained from selective angiography in only five of the 62 children (8%). Selective angiography showed an anomaly of the hepatic artery in 21 of the 62 children (33%). In 18 out of these 21 children (85%), an anomaly of the hepatic artery was already visible on the abdominal aortogram.Selective angiography did not play any significant role in the detection of an anomaly of the hepatic artery and should only be done if the Doppler ultrasound findings of the portal vein are inconclusive or if abdominal aortography cannot provide reliable information about the hepatic artery. For the evaluation of the portal vein and hepatic artery, we recommend Doppler ultrasound and abdominal aortography, a less invasive angiographic procedure.
