Acute upper limb ischemia in a young adult without cardiac disease. Value of transesophageal echocardiography. The authors report the case of a 34-year old woman with no previous cardiovascular disease who was admitted to hospital for acute ischaemia of the right arm due to embolism, preceded by two episodes of pain and tingling of the left arm related to subacute ischaemia. After right embolectomy, with no possibility of controlateral disobliteration an effective anticoagulation, no cardiac source of embolism could be found However, transoesophageal echography showed a large mobile thrombus in the aortic arch implanted just before the origin of the left subclavian artery. The only explanation for embolism to the right arm was a retro-oesophageal subclavian artery which was confirmed by scanner. Doppler and arteriography. These investigations, however, did not allow visualisation of the aortic thrombus. In view of the risk of recurrent embolism, a thrombectomy was performed without cardiopulmonary bypass, associated with correction of the vascular abnormality with no complications. This case shows that oesophageal echography is a useful investigation in the work up of acute arterial obstruction in young patients with no cardiac disease.
