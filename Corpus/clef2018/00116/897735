Ultrasonographic abdominal aortography. B-mode ultrasonography is an easily performed and accurate method of studying the abdominal aorta. The procedure is totally noninvasive and does not require patient hospitalization to detect aortic aneurysmal dilatation. Aneurysm size, extent, and associated aneurysmal clot formation can be determined more accurately than with contrast aortography. Para-aortic abdominal masses or organs that transmit pulsations can be detected where an aneurysm was originally suspected. Studies for serial size determination or postoperative follow-up are quickly and inexpensively performed, making this procedure the choice diagnostic modality for abdominal aortic aneurysms.
