Dilation mechanism, causes of restenosis and stenting in balloon coarctation angioplasty. This review focuses on the individual dilation mechanism, the possible cause of restenosis after balloon angioplasty and the clinical application of a stent in coarctation of the aorta. Balloon angioplasty is still not the first choice of therapy in neonates with native coarctation because of the potential risk of aortic disruption, the high incidence of restenosis and the satisfactory results of surgical coarctectomy. Intravascular ultrasound imaging provides the individual mechanism of aortic dilation by balloon, and this will be a new modality for assessing the relationship between restenosis and aortic luminal morphology after balloon dilation. Although the cause of restenosis after balloon angioplasty remains uncertain, it may be due to a combination of elastic recoil by ductal tissue constriction, intimal hyperplasia and arterial remodelling. A stent could be an effective alternative to conventional balloon angioplasty in native coarctation of the aorta, preventing ductal tissue constriction. However, the problematic relationship between patient growth and relative stenosis of the stent should be clarified before clinical application of a stent for this disease.
