Prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysms in men with diabetes. To assess the prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in men with diabetes aged 60 years and over.Prospective screening study.303 eligible participants among the first 1000 recruited to a large, community-based study of diabetes.Aortic diameter > or = 30 mm on screening ultrasonography, or previous surgery for AAA.AAA was diagnosed in three of the 303 men screened, and four others had previously had surgery for AAA. The aorta was not visualised in three obese men. Only one AAA required surgery (> or = 50 mm diameter). The overall prevalence of AAA was 2.3% (7/300), lower than that reported previously in the general population. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed statistically significant associations with fasting triglyceride levels, and a history of intermittent claudication.Although a small number of men with diabetes aged 60 or more have undiagnosed AAA, the prevalence does not appear to be high enough to warrant targeted ultrasound screening.
