Gender-associated differences in left ventricular geometry in patients with aortic valve disease and effect of distinct overload subsets. Gender-associated differences may play an important role in the way the left ventricle adapts to overload. The purpose of this study is to evaluate left ventricular (LV) geometry in patients referred for aortic valve replacement with distinct overload subsets. The echocardiograms of 128 patients with isolated aortic stenosis (n = 44), mixed aortic valvular disease (n = 51), and pure aortic regurgitation (n = 33) before aortic valve replacement were evaluated. Women had better LV function as measured by ejection fraction (58% vs 52% p = 0.01) and were slightly older (67 vs 62 years, p = 0.11). LV dimensions and volumes indexes were distinctively smaller in women irrespective of the subgroups analyzed. Men had larger LV mass and LV mass index, but women had higher LV mass/volume ratio. Gender-related differences in LV mass/volume ratio were most prominent in the aortic stenosis patients (3.1 g/ml for women vs 2.3 g/ml for men
