Embolization of iliac artery aneurysms following abdominal aortic aneurysm repair with a bifurcated graft. Six iliac artery aneurysms in four patients were percutaneously embolized. All patients had previous abdominal aortic aneurysm repair using a bifurcation graft with distal anastomoses to external iliac arteries. The iliac aneurysms involved the oversewn common iliac arteries in all patients. Embolizations were performed via an ipsilateral common femoral arterial approach, with metal coil occlusion of aneurysm inflow and outflow. All aneurysms were successfully thrombosed. Follow-up colour flow Doppler examinations showed continued aneurysm thrombosis in all patients. One patient developed post procedure buttock claudication, which improved over time there was no other procedure related morbidity. In conclusion, we describe a technique for percutaneous embolization of iliac aneurysms following abdominal aortic aneurysm repair with a bifurcated graft. We have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of this approach.
