Circulating microemboli in patients after aortic valve replacement with pulmonary autografts and mechanical valve prostheses. The pulmonary autograft procedure (Ross) is now considered the gold standard for aortic valve replacement. One of its advantages is the freedom from macroemboli without anticoagulation. Whether this holds true for circulating microemboli, detectable as high-intensity transient Doppler signals (HITS), has not yet been verified.We investigated 8 patients (2 women, 6 men mean age, 50.6+/-17.9 years) after the Ross procedure, 9 patients (3 women, 6 menIn contrast to mechanical valves, pulmonary autografts are seldom the source of microemboli, confirming the pulmonary autograft as the superior substitute for aortic valve replacement.
