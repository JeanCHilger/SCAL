Primary stenting of atherosclerotic renal artery ostial stenosis. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for atherosclerotic ostial lesions of the renal arteries has resulted in high restenosis rates. Recent reports of angioplasty with intravascular stenting show improved results over angioplasty alone. The purpose of this study is to review the results of primary stenting of ostial renal artery stenosis at our institution. Twenty one patients (11 men, 10 women, age 63 +/- 11 years), with atherosclerotic renal artery ostial stenosis in association with hypertension or renal insufficiency underwent renal angioplasty with primary stenting during a 2-year period. Medical records were reviewed for indications, technical success, complications, restenosis, response of hypertension and response of renal insufficiency. A technical success was defined as a normal postprocedure arteriogram with no residual stenosis and no residual gradient. Restenosis was defined as > or =60% diameter reduction identified by arteriography, or duplex scan demonstrating a renal artery to aortic ratio of > or =3.5. Thirty-three stents were placed in 25 arteries with four patients having bilateral procedures. All patients were hypertensive. Nine patients (43%) had chronic renal insufficiency (creatinine > or =1.5 mg/dl). One patient was on hemodialysis. The immediate technical success rate was 95%. Six complications occurred in four patients (two pseudoaneurysms, two dissections requiring additional stents, renal failure, and atheroembolization). Mean arterial blood pressure improved from 117 +/- 13.4 to 103 +/- 12.8 mmHg (p = 0.002) after stenting. Serum creatinine levels decreased from 1.48 +/- 0.57 to 1.31 +/- 0.41 (p = 0.07). Eight patients developed restenosis. The mean follow up was 13 +/- 7 months. Life table analysis showed a cumulative restenosis rate of 65 +/- 18% at 24 months. We advise caution in the application of renal stenting for the treatment of ostial lesions, particularly in patients for whom standard surgical revascularization options are available.
