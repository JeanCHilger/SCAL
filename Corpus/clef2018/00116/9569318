Magnetic resonance imaging of congenital abnormalities of the thoracic aorta. This article outlines the ability of MR imaging in the detection and presurgical evaluation of congenital abnormalities of the thoracic aorta (CATA). Congenital abnormalities of the thoracic aorta may be found incidentally on chest radiographs in patients without symptoms, or it can be associated with clinical findings which are very variable depending on the association with congenital cardiac malformations or vascular ring. When CATA is suspected as the cause of anomalies in the mediastinum in asymptomatic patients, confirmation of the abnormality should be by MR imaging allowing precise evaluation of the thoracic aorta and origin of the principal arteries. When CATA is considered because clinical findings indicate coarctation of the aorta, vascular ring or associated cardiac disorder, evaluation with ultrasound can be complemented by MR, which in most cases will replace the diagnostic catheterization.
