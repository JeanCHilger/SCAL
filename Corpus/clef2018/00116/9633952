Biplane color flow duplex intravenous intravascular ultrasound for arterial visualization. To describe a feasibility study in a sheep model using an intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) instrument in an intravenous position to produce color flow, B-mode images of arterial segments along with Doppler blood flow velocities.Four healthy adult male sheep were anesthetized for surgical exposure of the right external jugular vein. A 9.0F sheath was also introduced in the common femoral artery for arteriography and device insertion. A 7.5-MHz ultrasound probe with 1-cm graduation markers was passed into the jugular vein. B-mode and color flow pictures were captured at aortic branches in cross and longitudinal sections. Length measurements between aortic branches and Doppler spectral velocities were obtained. Guidewire, balloon, and stent maneuvers were monitored by the stationary intravenous IVUS probe.High-quality visualization of the entire abdominal aorta and its branches was achieved in all animals. With the probe stationary in the vena cava, a 1.5-cm linear segment of the aorta could be continuously observed in both B-mode and color flow ultrasound scans. Insertion and implantation of a Palmaz balloon-expandable stent was guided by intravenous IVUS alone. Selective catheterization of the right renal artery was followed visually by moving the intravenous IVUS probe sequentially.Intravenous IVUS appears feasible as a guidance and monitoring tool for endovascular interventions. While conventional IVUS provides only cross-sectional images in B-mode, intravenous IVUS captures color flow and Doppler velocity data as well. These added ultrasound modalities may offer potential advantages for guidance of endovascular procedures and endoleak detection.
