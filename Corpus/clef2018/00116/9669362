The significance of donor leg distal runoff in femorofemoral bypass grafting. The aim of this study is to determine if femorofemoral bypass grafting is an effective operation for unilateral iliac occlusive disease, and to assess for factors that may predict a poorer outcome. A retrospective review was conducted of cases identified from a prospective audit database.Information was obtained from the clinical notes of 97 patients who had 100 femorofemoral bypass graft operations. All living patients were invited for assessment which included colour duplex sonography of the graft and measurement of the ankle brachial index.Using life-table analysis, the five-year graft secondary patency for claudicants was 79% and for those with critical ischaemia 78%. Five-year survival for claudicants was 65% and for those with critical ischaemia, 38%. Poor distal runoff in the infrapopliteal arteries of the donor limb adversely affected graft patency. Graft survival was not affected by the indication for operation, by donor or recipient superficial femoral artery patency, or by the need for endarterectomy, pre-operative angioplasty or the graft material.Femorofemoral bypass grafting is the procedure of choice for all patients who require surgical intervention for unilateral iliac occlusion and donor limb distal runoff may be an important determinant of graft patency.
