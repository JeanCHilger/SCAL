Fifth-year hemodynamic performance of the prima stentless aortic valve. The medium-term hemodynamic performance of stentless valves has not been widely reported, particularly in comparison with in vitro studies. Therefore, we have assessed prospectively the hemodynamics of the Edwards Prima valve in its fifth year after implantation in the aortic position, and compared the results with those at 1 month after implantation and also with in vitro data.Thirty-five patients (age, 77 +/- 6 years 19 men) were prospectively studied by Doppler echocardiography at 1 month and 52 +/- 8 months after implantation of a Prima stentless valve. Valve hemodynamics were assessed by measuring the mean pressure gradient, mean valve resistance, and effective orifice area. Left ventricular systolic function was quantified by ejection fraction, the degree of hypertrophy by ventricular mass index, and the ratio of ventricular wall thickness to cavity radius as a measure of ventricular geometry.With a mean valve size of 24.6 +/- 2.2 mm in the fifth year after implantation, the mean pressure gradient was 6.2 +/- 3.5 mm Hg, the mean valve resistance, 29 +/- 16 dyne x s(-1) x cm(-5)), and the effective orifice area was 2.05 +/- 0.50 cm2. Compared with 1 month after operation, there was a 47% decrease in mean valve resistance (p = 0.002) and a 39% increase in effective orifice area (p = 0.001). Furthermore, both effective orifice area and mean valve resistance in the fifth year did not differ from their in vitro counterparts, whereas the left ventricular ejection fraction (0.64 +/- 0.14), the left ventricular mass index (119 +/- 49 g/m2), and the ratio of ventricular wall thickness to cavity radius (0.44 +/- 0.13) were within the normal range.This study suggests that the Prima valve is a reliable stentless aortic bioprosthesis. This is supported by a favorable medium-term clinical outcome, durable hemodynamic performance, and normal mean values of left ventricular ejection fraction and mass index in the fifth year after implantation.
