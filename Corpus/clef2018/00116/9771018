False aneurysms of lower extremity arteries: noninvasive preop diagnosis with magnetic resonance angiography and Doppler ultrasonography. The purpose of this study was to work out a diagnostic algorithm to be used in patients surgically treated because of a false aneurysm of arteries supplying the lower limb. The study includes preoperative vessel evaluation as well as treatment results assessment with MRA and US methods. Examinations included until now 16 patients with clinical false aneurysm suspicion. Most cases presented false aneurysms being complications after arterial graft implantation, in two patients, who were not previously operated, diagnosed false aneurysms were the result of injury. We performed 23 examinations (7 of which were postoperative treatment result evaluation examinations). Examinations were performed on MR equipment with a 1.5 T field induction. The 2D TOF with traveling presaturation method was used. Primary data and reconstructed (MIP) angiograms were analyzed by a radiologist having no access to clinical information and previous examination results. Ultrasound duplex doppler examinations were performed with 7 MHz linear probe. The MRA examinations visualized 7 false aneurysms of the lower Y-graft junction. Clinical verification, ultrasonography examinations and surgery confirmed the existence of 6 aneurysms of the Y-graft as well as 5 out of 6 diagnosed in the ileofemoral graft junctions area. The post-traumatic aorta aneurysm and the postarteriographic femoral aneurysm were also confirmed. Two false positive MRA diagnoses were due to dilatation of the artery below the graft junction, in one case it was a dilatation of the vessel below a stenosis. Furthermore, the MRA helped diagnosing stenoses and occlusions in femoral arteries and common iliac artery.
