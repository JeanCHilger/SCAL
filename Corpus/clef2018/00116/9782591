Mönckeberg media calcinosis. Mönckeberg's disease (MD) is characterized by media calcinosis (MC) of the arteries of the lower extremities. MC is distinct from atherosclerosis, occurs in different vascular beds, and its etiology is unknown. Here, we report a case of a 46-year old male with no prior medical history of cardiovascular disease, no metabolic risk factors, and normal laboratory findings, who presented with accidental findings of marked diffuse calcifications along the entire course of the femoral superficial and profunda arteries on plain x-ray films. Follow-up cardiovascular diagnostics using high resolution B-mode ultrasonography, ultrafast CT, and x-ray angiography revealed extensive abluminal arterial wall calcification without evidence for premature or advanced intima-related atherosclerosis in the abdominal aorta, in the arteries of the pelvis, and the lower extremities. Calcifications were also present in the proximal segments of the circumflex and left anterior descending coronary arteries. The carotid arteries showed no calcium deposits. This observation confirms that MC may occur in the absence of secondary risk factors (primary MC) and independently of atherosclerosis. Simultaneous involvement of several vascular territories including the coronary arteries appears possible. The systemic character of primary MC is consistent with a genetical cause of this as yet poorly defined disease.
