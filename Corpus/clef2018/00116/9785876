A case report of intrathoracic aneurysm of left subclavian artery. A case of intrathoracic aneurysm of the left subclavian artery is reported. The case was 68-year-old male. Chest CT and angiography revealed an aneurysm of left subclavian artery (LSA) located the proximal portion of LSA. The chest was opened by fourth intercostal thoracotomy. We evaluated the intima of distal aortic arch and LSA by introperative direct echography using a small probe (finger tip size). Since there was no calcification or mural thrombi at the distal aortic arch, the aneurysm was resected using partial cardiopulmonary bypass and the orifice of LSA was closed direct suture. LSA was reconstructed with knitted Dacron graft (8 mm). Postoperative course was uneventful.
