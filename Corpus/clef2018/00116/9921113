The infection of the vascular prosthesis treated by the human cryopreserved allograft implantation: a case report. 75 years old patient was admitted to the Department with infection of the previously implanted bifurcated aorto-bifemoral by-pass. Periprosthetic retroperitoneal abdominal abscess in the US--colour doppler examination was recognized. Unilateral femoral pulse was present--the patient after femoral amputation of the right leg. In the first step of the treatment, the drainage of the periprosthetic abscess was performed. Because of poor results of the local and pharmacological treatment and bleeding from the prosthesis, in the next step, human cryopreserved aorto--femoral allograft was implanted "in situ". Simultaneously, bifurcated prosthesis was evacuated. In the postoperative period, healing of the inquinal wounds was excellent. There were no problems connected with peripheral circulation. The patient was discharged from the hospital on the 24th post-operative day in the good local and general condition. Homograft is an efficient and promising alternative for the treatment of severe vascular prosthesis infections.
