Diagnosis of the abdominal vascular system by means of electron-beam computed tomography (EBT). To evaluate the potential of electron-beam computed tomography (EBT) in the pre- and postinterventional assessment of vascular abdominal pathologies.Forty patients with implanted transjugular portosystemic shunt (TIPS), 12 patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease and 8 patients with infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm after endovascular implantation of bifurcation stents were prospectively examined with contrast-enhanced EBT during one year. The evaluation included analysis of time-density curves (TDC) and 3D reconstructions. Results were compared with Doppler sonography and/or DSA.In 30 of 40 TIPS patients, identical results were found with EBT, Doppler sonography and/or DSA. Reduced perfusions of the TIPS, which were subsequently confirmed by DSA, could not be shown with EBT in 3 patients. Nine of 12 patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease and angiographically proven stenosis (> 75%) showed a reduced and delayed peak density of the time-density curves. The quantification of arterial stenosis, however, did not follow the angiographic values. In all patients with the implanted bifurcation stents, EBT could correctly exclude a leakage of the stent.EBT has certain advantages over conventional spiral CT in the evaluation of abdominal vascular pathologies due to the additional assessment of perfusion parameters. Clinical indications for the use of EBT are seen especially in the postinterventional follow-up of patients with implanted stents.
