Ruptured infrarenal aortic aneurysm--a critical evaluation. Objective evaluation of the management of patients with ruptured infrarenal aortic aneurysm in emergency situations has been described rarely.Fifty-two consecutive patients with ruptured infrarenal aortic aneurysm (mean age, 70.3 years range, 56-89 yearsThe time between the appearance of first symptoms and the referral of patients to the hospital was more than 5 hours in 37 patients (71%). Thirty-eight patients (71%) had signs of shock at time of admission. Ultrasound was performed in 81% of patients as the first diagnostic procedure. The most frequent site of aortic rupture was the left retroperitoneum (87%). Intraoperatively, acute left ventricular failure occurred in four patients, and cardiac arrest in two others. The postoperative course was complicated significantly in 34 patients. The overall mortality rate was 36.5% (n = 19). In 35 patients, APACHE II score was assessed, showing a probability of death of more than 40% in five patients and lower than 30% in 17 others. No patient showing probability of death of above 75% at the fifth postoperative day survived (n = 7).Ruptured aortic aneurysm demands surgical intervention. Clinical outcome is also influenced by preclinical and anesthetic management. The severity of disease as well as the patient's prognosis can be approximated using APACHE II score. Treatment results of heterogeneous patient groups can be compared.
