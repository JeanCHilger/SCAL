Aortic pulmonary autograft implant: medium-term follow-up with a note on a new right ventricular pulmonary artery conduit. The Ross operation has been applied to various aortic valve pathologies, particularly when somatic growth is an issue. However, associated cardiac disease and technical problems may limit its use with regard to associated procedures and issues of right ventricular outflow reconstruction.From December 1992 to March 1998, 24 patients underwent aortic pulmonary autograft implantation. There were 14 males and 10 females, 15+/-10 years of age (mean +/- SD) (range 1 to 50 years), weighing 42.8+/-20 kg (mean +/- SD) (range 8 to 78 kg). Aortic insufficiency was present in 15 (62.5%) patients, stenosis in 8 (33.3%) patients, and valvar stenosis associated with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction in 1 (4.1%) patient. Etiology was rheumatic in 17 patients and congenital in 7. The Ross procedure was accompanied by a partial-Konno left ventricular outflow enlargement in one patient, and mitral valve annuloplasty, mitral commissurotomy, and tricuspid valve replacement in three other patients, respectively. The right ventricular outflow was reconstructed with a valved pulmonary homograft in 14 patients and with a Shelhigh No-React porcine pulmonary conduit in 10 patients. Evaluation was done by New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class and by echocardiography at a follow-up of 22.8+/-24 months (mean +/- SD) (range 3 to 63 months).There were no operative mortalities and no postoperative arrhythmias. One (4.1%) patient required intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support for 3 days, one (4.1%) patient died 2 years later of probable arrhythmia, and one (4.1%) patient required mechanical aortic valve replacement 2 years later for severe autograft insufficiency. Left ventricular ejection fraction was unchanged (preoperative 62.4%+/-30%, postoperative 64.2%+/-30% [mean +/- SD], [p = NS]) and no significant gradient was documented by echocardiographic Doppler in the right and left ventricular outflow tracts. The aortic insufficiency scale decreased from a mean of 3.9+/-0.2 to a mean of 1+/-0 (p < 0.01). NYHA Class decreased to I in all patients, from III (10) and II (14).The pulmonary autograft in the aortic position is suitable for aortic valve replacement in pediatric and adult patients with good medium-term results and in patients with rheumatic etiology, and it provides a desirable solution in the presence of associated pathologies, such as left ventricular tract obstruction or associated multivalvular disease. The development of new means of right ventricular outflow reconstruction must parallel the progress achieved for the left side.
