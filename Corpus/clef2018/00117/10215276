Usefulness of flow reserve in the left internal mammary artery to determine graft patency to the left anterior descending coronary artery. Two-dimensional Doppler echocardiography (DE) and intravascular Doppler-tipped guidewire (flowire) have been used to measure flow in aortocoronary conduits at rest and during hyperemia, but they have not been compared. We investigated which flow velocity parameters obtained with these 2 different techniques can predict left internal mammary artery (LIMA) graft patency. Twenty-nine patients with previous coronary artery bypass grafting referred for evaluation of symptoms of coronary artery disease were studied after cardiac catheterization using the flowire and DE. Proximal LIMA graft flow velocity was measured at rest and during hyperemia produced by 140 microg/kg/min of intravenous adenosine infusion over 6 minutes with both methods. Normal LIMA grafts and left anterior descending artery (LAD) distal to the anastomosis were present in 16 patients, whereas 13 had >70% graft or native vessel stenosis. The coronary flow velocity reserve (r = 0.79) and the diastolic-to-systolic velocity ratio during hyperemia (r = 0.73) correlated very well between the 2 techniques. Among the variables obtained with the 2 techniques, the intragraft coronary flow velocity reserve measured by both methods was the only independent predictor of graft/recipient LAD patency. This variable had a sensitivity and specificity of 86% at a cutoff point of 2.07 with the flowire method and 83% at a cutoff point of 1.54 with DE. The areas below the receiver-operating characteristic curves were 0.91 and 0.93, respectively. Coronary flow velocity reserve measurements obtained with DE appears a reliable noninvasive method for assessing LIMA graft and/or LAD distal to the anastomosis patency in patients after bypass surgery and correlate very well with those directly obtained by intravascular Doppler.
