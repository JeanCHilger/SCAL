Endoluminal repair of aneurysms containing ostia of essential branch arteries: an experimental model. To examine experimentally the feasibility of transfemoral endoluminal repair of aneurysms containing the ostia of essential branch arteries.In a canine model (n = 4), suprarenal aortic aneurysms were created by suturing an artificial patch onto an anterior arteriotomy. Following a 2-week recovery period, the dogs underwent endovascular exclusion of their aneurysms using an aortic stent-graft with separate renal artery branch grafts. Outcome was evaluated using angiography, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), Doppler flow, invasive pressure monitoring, and autopsy, respectively.Successful creation and subsequent endovascular exclusion of the aneurysm using aortic stent-grafts and separate bilateral renal artery stent-grafts was achieved in all trials. Angiographically, all aneurysms were excluded from aortic flow and all renal arteries were patent at completion of the procedure. With IVUS, good graft apposition and absence of perigraft flow were demonstrated in all animals. Mean pressure in the aneurysmal sac at completion of the procedure was 40 +/- 7 mmHg, compared to a mean systemic blood pressure of 105 +/- 8 mmHg (p < 0.05). At autopsy, no gross intimal damage was seen in the aorta or the renal arteries, and intact aortic grafts and branch grafts without twisting, coiling, or kinking were found in all trials.In an acute animal model, suprarenal aortic aneurysms can be excluded from the circulation with preservation of renal flow using an endoluminally placed aortic stent-graft with separate branch grafts.
