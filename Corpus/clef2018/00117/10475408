Initial experience with MIDCAB grafting using the gastroepiploic artery. Minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass grafting with the gastroepiploic artery can be used in primary operations and reoperations to revascularize the inferior or anterior surface of the heart.Patients who had symptomatic coronary artery disease limited to a single coronary distribution were selected. Coronary targets were grafted with the pedicled gastroepiploic artery through a small midline epigastric incision. Patients were followed with scheduled outpatient clinic visits, Doppler examination, and selective recatheterization.Between May 1995 and November 1997, 74 patients underwent gastroepiploic artery minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass grafting 33 (45%) had a primary operation and 41 (55%), a reoperation. Grafting was performed to the distal right coronary artery (n = 38), the posterior descending artery (n = 28), or the distal left anterior descending coronary artery (n = 8). There were six deaths (8%) within 30 days after operation. Twenty patients (28%) underwent recatheterizationInferior minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass grafting with the gastroepiploic artery avoids the risks of repeat sternotomy, aortic manipulation, and cardiopulmonary bypass. Patency rates, however, were lower than expected, and there is significant morbidity and mortality associated with high-risk patients undergoing the procedure. Continued follow-up is essential to evaluate long-term graft patency and patient survival.
