Postoperative follow-up of type A aortic dissectionexperience with 67 patients. The surgical treatment of type A aortic dissection is usually palliative and most surviving patients remain at considerable risk to develop late postoperative complications consequently, there is the need for careful long-term follow-up. The present study reports on our experience in the postoperative follow-up of a consecutive series of patients with type A aortic dissection.Between January 1986 and December 1996, 89 patients underwent emergency surgery for type A acute aortic dissection the overall hospital mortality rate was 22% (20/89). This study includes the 69 hospital survivors (49 men and 20 women). Forty-six patients had ascending aortic graft replacement, 13 patients underwent replacement of aortic valve and ascending aorta by a composite graft. The surgical repair was extended to the aortic arch in 5 patients. All patients were serially evaluated by clinical examination and imaging techniques (transthoracic echocardiography in all patients, magnetic resonance imaging in 40, transesophageal echocardiography in 33 and computed tomography in 25). Follow-up was complete in 97% of patients (two patients were lost to follow-up and excluded from the study) and extended to a maximum of 152 months (mean 74 +/- 39 months). The postoperative quality of life was assessed by a questionnaire in 51 current survivors. Risk factors for cardiovascular death, reoperation and poor quality of life were investigated with univariate and multivariate analysis.During the follow-up period 15 patients (22%) died in 13 cases death was due to cardiovascular causes and in 6 of them it was related to aortic disease. The Kaplan-Meier survival was 92 +/- 3%, 87 +/- 5%, 78 +/- 6% and 70 +/- 8% at 2, 4, 6 and 8 years, respectively. A persistent aortic dissection was demonstrated in 50 patients (75%) and 42 of them showed the presence of flow in the false lumen. A dilatation of one or more aortic segments was found in 59 patients (88%), with a diameter > or = 50 mm in 17 and > or = 60 mm in 8. In 30 patients who underwent transesophageal echocardiography the relation between aortic dimensions and flow pattern in the false lumen was examinedThe long-term prognosis after surgical treatment of type A aortic dissection is not satisfactory because of a significant risk of late complications. However, the results of our study can be judged fairly good, particularly if we consider the natural history of the disease.
