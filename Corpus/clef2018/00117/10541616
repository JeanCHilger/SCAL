Ruptured versus elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair: outcome and cost. During a recent 30-month period, we repaired 10 ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (RAAA) at our institution. To evaluate the survival, postoperative morbidity, and financial impact of treating RAAA, we compared these patients with 10 randomly selected patients undergoing elective AAA (EAAA). Both groups were comparable for age, gender, and incidence of diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and renal failure. Although we have noted a dramatic increase in survival for RAAA (90%), the morbidity continues to be unacceptably high (60%). Efforts should be made toward better detection of AAA prior to rupture as well as development of strategies to minimize or prevent these major complications. Potential average savings accrued from one patient undergoing EAAA repair rather than RAAA repair ($93,139. 21) can be used to perform screening abdominal ultrasound tests in patients at increased risk of having an AAA.
