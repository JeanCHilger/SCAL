Pulmonary stenosis caused by extrinsic compression of an aortic pseudoaneurysm of a composite aortic graft. Pulmonic stenosis and stenosis of the right ventricular outflow tract related to extrinsic compression have been described in patients with tumors, in a patient with a pericardial cyst, and in patients with vascular abnormalities as an unruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm, a giant coronary artery pseudoaneurysm and an aortic arch aneurysm. Composite graft replacement of the ascending aorta and aortic valve with reimplantation of the coronary arteries has some inherent complications. Our case report describes a patient with a pericomposite graft aneurysm presenting as a stenosis of the pulmonary artery, detected by Doppler echocardiography.
