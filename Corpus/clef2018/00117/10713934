Left atrial pressure gradient and right heart failure secondary to compression of the left atrium by a huge ascending aortic aneurysm: a case report. A 71-year-old man was admitted to our department with congestive heart failure on June 28, 1998. He previously had an aortic valve replacement because of aortic regurgitation probably due to annuloaortic ectasia in 1984. Thoracic aortic aneurysm was identified during the postoperative course. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a huge saccular ascending aortic aneurysm of 12 x 11.5 x 9.5 cm size, which had severely compressed the left atrium. Doppler echocardiography documented an accelerated flow (2.2 m/sec) in the left atrium in early diastole. The calculated pressure gradient was 19 mmHg. All pressures in the right heart system were elevated. This is the first case of pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure secondary to compression of the left atrium in a patient with thoracic aortic aneurysm.
