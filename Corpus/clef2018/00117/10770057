Aortic valve/root replacement using a stentless bioprosthesis (Medtronic Freestyle valve). The purpose of the study is to assess the clinical and hemodynamic performance of aortic valve replacement (AVR) with the Freestyle bioprosthesis.Twenty-one patients received AVR with a Freestyle aortic root bio-prosthesis between May 1998 and October 1999. Eighteen patients underwent AVR with subcoronary method and three patients with aortic root (full root) method. Patients were evaluated postoperatively at discharge by clinical examination and color Doppler echocardiography.There was one death due to multi-organ failure. No patients experienced valve deterioration, paravalvular leak, unacceptable hemodynamic performance, nor thromboembolic event. Excellent function is demonstrated by very low gradient (mean gradient 7.2 +/- 4.7 mmHg) through aortic valve and no significant aortic regurgitation (none: 11, trivial/mild: 10). All patients had been in New York Heart Association Functional Class III and IV preoperatively, and after surgery, 17 patients were in Class I, and 3 were in Class II.The Freestyle bioprosthesis has good clinical and hemodynamic performance without Coumadin. Further follow-up is required to evaluated valve durability.
