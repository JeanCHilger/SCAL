Mycotic aneurysm of the abdominal aorta in a patient undergoing hemodialysis: an unusual complication of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. When Staphylococcus aureus is repeatedly positive in blood cultures even under effective antibiotics therapy (vancomycin, teicoplanin, or rifampin), computed tomography scan and sonography should be performed early to exclude mycotic aneurysm of the deeply seated arteries, especially in patients with abdominal aortic calcification. Before 1990, the most common causative organism of suprarenal aortic mycotic aneurysm was Salmonella since 1990, it has been gram-positive cocci (i.e., Streptococcus and Staphylococcus) rather than gram-negative bacilli (i.e., Salmonella), possibly because of the more invasive procedures performed in clinical settings, but this hypothesis needs further investigation.
