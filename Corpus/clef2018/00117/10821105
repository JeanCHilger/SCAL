Symptomatic subtotal occlusion of the innominate artery treated with balloon angioplasty and stenting. To report the endovascular treatment of a subtotal occlusion of the innominate artery giving rise to subclavian steal syndrome.A 60-year-old man in general good health was admitted to the hospital for sudden onset of amaurosis in the right eye. Thrombosis of the central retinal artery was diagnosed. Physical examination, color flow duplex imaging, and aortic arch angiography showed a subtotal occlusion of the innominate artery with right subclavian steal syndrome. One month later, balloon dilation and stenting of the innominate artery was performed through a right axillary access without cerebral protection. The innominate artery was recanalized with correction of the steal syndrome and restoration of the right radial pulse no complications occurred. Twelve months later, color flow duplex sonography confirmed innominate stent patency and antegrade flow in the right vertebral artery.Our experience supports the view that percutaneous endovascular techniques are appropriate and are the preferred treatment for lesions of the supra-aortic vessels. Continued surveillance will determine their long-term durability.
