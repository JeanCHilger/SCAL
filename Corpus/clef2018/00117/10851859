Obstetric conduct in IUGR. Purpose of the study is to identify the correct attitude that the obstetrician must engage in the management of pregnancy and birth in case of IUGR. Different methods of diagnosis and therapy of IUGR and the formalities of assistance to the birth have been examined and compared. Accurate clinical examinations of the mother, the study of fetal kariotype and ultrasonography, are essential for the diagnosis of IUGR. The genetic study could be performed by collecting chorionic villi, amniocentesis, cordocentesis or placenta biopsy. Ultrasonography identifies the cases of IUGR, and distinguishes early IUGR from late IUGR. Color Doppler identifies the pathology of the flow in the umbilical artery, in the abdominal aorta and in the middle cerebral artery. After the 26th week, the follow-up of the fetus with IUGR is done with cardiotocography with or without acoustic stimulation or oxytocin. The amelioration of maternal conditions is obtained by avoiding the cigarette smoking, preferring to rest in bed and a balanced feeding the hyperoxygenation doesn't find unanimous consent. The treatment off IUGR can consist of abdominal decompression, intra-abdominal infusion of amniotic liquid, or use of aspirin. The birth is carried out in the hospital, when the fetus has reached a sufficient maturity. The management of IUGR requires an accurate follow-up and an adequate antepartum therapy. The goal is a birth with less risk.
