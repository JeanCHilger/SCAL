Concurrent multivessel stenting in a patient with multifocal arterial disease. To report the concurrent endovascular treatment of multiple stenoses in different vascular territories.A 45-year-old male presented with an aortic arch syndrome, renovascular hypertension, and Leriche syndrome. Intra-arterial digital arteriography disclosed occlusion of the left subclavian artery and stenoses in the left common carotid artery (CCA), the right CCA at the bifurcation, the left renal artery, and both iliac arteries. In a single procedure, the patient received 5 stents in 2 carotid, 1 renal, and 2 iliac arteries. At 3-month follow-up, color flow duplex imaging confirmed continued patency of all stented arteries.This case illustrates the feasibility, safety, and cost effectiveness of treating multivessel stenoses using a single-session endovascular approach executed by experienced interventionists.
