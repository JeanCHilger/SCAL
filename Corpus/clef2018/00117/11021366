Carotid disease is a risk factor for stroke in coronary bypass operations. The purpose of this study was to investigate the risk of perioperative major cerebrovascular events (MCVEs) in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and to develop preventive therapy. After excluding the patients with marked ascending aortic atheromas and those with combined intracardiac procedures such as valve replacement and aneurysmectomy, 722 consecutive patients who had carotid artery duplex scanning (CADS) and CABG were studied. The results of the study showed the correlation of advanced age, smoking, previous major cerebrovascular event (MCVE), and severe coronary artery disease with high grade carotid artery stenosis of 80-99% (p < 0.05). A total of 13 patients had perioperative MCVE and an analysis of risk factors showed that the MCVE correlated with carotid stenosis of > 60% and reduced cardiac output requiring inotropic support (p < 0.01). Prophylactic carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients with 80% to 99% carotid stenosis notably decreased the incidence of MCVE (p < 0.01), and the use of the "pump off" technique instead of standard cardiopulmonary bypass decreased MCVE (p = 0.056). On the basis of these data, prophylactic carotid endarterectomy is effective in averting perioperative MCVE in subjects with carotid stenosis of 80% to 99%, and for those with 60% to 79% carotid stenosis, the pump off technique decreases MCVE.
