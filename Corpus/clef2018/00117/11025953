Perioperative management of endovascular stent graft placement for abdominal aortic aneurysm. We retrospectively examined the changes in hemodynamics, oxygen index and renal function along with the complications in 25 patients who had undergone endovascular stent graft placement (ESG) surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysm. During stent graft placement, mean arterial pressure decreased to 58 +/- 8 mmHg by increasing the dose of anesthetics and/or using vasodilators. Except for this intended hypotensive period, mean arterial pressure and heart rate were relatively stable and adequately maintained during surgical manipulation. Oxygenation index was well maintained. A patient with a high preoperative creatinine level underwent prophylactic hemodialysis postoperatively. In other patients except one who died in early postoperative period, both BUN and creatinine levels were kept within normal ranges. Four patients died postoperatively and the causes of the death in two patients are related to the surgical procedure one with multiple emboli possibly due to released atheloma from the aortic wall during procedure, the other with sepsis due to infected stent graft. Although ESG is a well tolerated procedure, embolism is the most serious complication. Careful preoperative evaluation of the ascending arch and descending aortic wall and monitoring with transcranial doppler are necessary.
