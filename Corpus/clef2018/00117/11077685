Transluminal exclusion of a subclavian artery aneurysm with stent-graft implantation. In a 73 year-old male patient with generalized atherosclerosis, known infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, renal artery stenosis, and coronary artery disease, an aneurysm of the proximal left subclavian artery was successfully excluded by implantation of a JOSTENT-Peripheral stent graft. Angiographic follow up after 6 and 12 months showed an excellent outcome with complete exclusion of the aneurysm. Intravascular ultrasound showed no neo-intimal hyperplasia within the stent. A computed tomography revealed complete thrombosis of the aneurysm.
