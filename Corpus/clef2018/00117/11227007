Endoscopic drainage for pancreatic pseudocyst in children. The authors report here the results of endoscopic cystogastrostomy performed on 3 children aged 11, 3, and 2.5 years with nonresolving pancreatic pseudocyst (PP) of 12, 9.5, and 7 cm in diameter. The etiology of PP was abdominal trauma in 2 and idiopathic acute pancreatitis in 1 case. Ultrasound and computed tomography scans confirmed the diagnosis and suitability for gastric drainage. After the puncture of cyst, a double pig-tail stent was placed for the permanent drainage of cystogastrostomy. Complete regression was confirmed by follow-up ultrasonography at 8, 6, and 7 weeks, respectively. There were no procedure-related complications, nor was there a recurrence of cyst during the 2 years of follow-up. This report suggests that children with nonresolving PP, that are anatomically accessible, can be treated successfully and safely by endoscopic drainage.
