Transesophageal color Doppler three-dimensional echocardiographic detection of prosthetic aortic valve dehiscence: correlation with surgical findings. Three-dimensional echocardiography is being used with increasing frequency to evaluate cardiac function and structure. We present two cases of prosthetic aortic valve endocarditis where three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography correlated with the intraoperative surgical findings of prosthetic dehiscence and communication with an abscess cavity. When compared with two-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography, three-dimensional echocardiography was more accurate in defining the exact site of dehiscence and communication with an abscess cavity. The echocardiographic images were oriented as a clockface watch to conform to the surgeon's visualization of the aortic root as viewed from the right side of the patient.
