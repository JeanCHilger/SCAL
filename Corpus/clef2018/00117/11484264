Continent preternatural anus--histomorphological and functional aspects. Transplantation of a free smooth-muscular cuff around a terminal large-intestinal segment, brought out as preternatural anus, secures high-degree continence and controlled evacuatory rhythm of the intestinal content. The preserved structure of the muscular layers in the cuff wall and the myogenic nature of smooth muscle tone are preconditions for functional activity manifestation in conditions of denervation, isolation and even after block of neurons and intramural ganglia. Five preparations comprising the smooth muscle cuff and recipient large-intestinal segment undergo histomorphologic and electromyographic study within a year of transplantation. In a series of 31 patients with drawn out continent preternatural anus the thickness of the abdominal wall together with the smooth muscle cuff graft is echographically registered at the end of the first postoperative year. The echographically documented abdominal wall thickness is compared with the histomorphologically established values of the indicator under study. Analysis of the functional activity of the smooth-muscle-cuff transplant is also done.
