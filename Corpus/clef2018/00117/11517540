Detection of visceral ischemia with doplex scanning method of mesenteric arteries: in patients with acute type B aortic dissection. Between March, 1997 and January, 1999, 11 patients with acute type B aortic dissection underwent doplex scanning evaluation of mesenteric arteries for the early detection of visceral ischemia. Peak systolic velocity (PSV) of the celiac artery (CeA) and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) was measured on their admission. Mean PSV of CeA in the non-ischemic group (8 patients) and in the ischemic group (3 patients) was 1.66 +/- 0.34 m/sec and 3.60 +/- 0.49 m/sec (p = 0.0481), respectively. Mean PSV of the SMA in the non-ischemic group and in the ischemic group was 1.93 +/- 0.52 m/sec and 3.33 +/- 0.37 m/sec (p = 0.00768), respectively. All patients with PSV of the mesenteric arteries above 3.00 m/sec presented visceral ischemia that required emergency operation. If PSV of the mesenteric arteries exceeds 3.00 m/sec, urgent surgical repair should be considered.
