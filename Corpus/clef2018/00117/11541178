Cardiovascular response to lower body negative pressure before and after 20 days horizontal bed rest. To evaluate the effects of 20 days bed rest (BR) on cardiovascular system in normal subjects, left ventricular (LV) echocardiography and vascular ultrasound of the common carotid artery and abdominal aorta were performed during rest and a supine lower body negative pressure (LBNP) test in 14 healthy volunteers (mean age: 22 years) before and after BR. After BR, heart rates (HR) at rest and during LBNP (-40 mmHg) increased. In contrast, LV dimensions, stroke volume, and blood pressures decreased both at rest and during LBNP. Also LBNP tolerance time decreased after BR. Although resting cardiac output (CO) and abdominal aortic flow decreased after bed rest, CO and abdominal aortic flow were unchanged during LBNP comparing before and after BR. Common carotid artery flows both at rest and during LBNP showed no change after BR. LBNP did not increase HR before BR, but increased HR prominently after BR. In conclusion, LBNP tolerance time and LV size during LBNP decreased after BR, suggesting orthostatic intolerance due to a decreased blood volume. However, CO and flow in the abdominal aorta and common carotid artery during LBNP were similar before and after BR due to a compensatory increase after BR.
