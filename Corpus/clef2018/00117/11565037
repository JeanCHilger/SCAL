Abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Newer, minimally invasive catheter-based endovascular technology utilizing stent grafts are currently being evaluated for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. A retrospective review of all (3 years) consecutive, non-ruptured elective AAA repairs was undertaken to document the results of AAA surgical repair in a modern cohort of patients to allow a contemporary comparison with the evolving endoluminal data. One hundred twenty-one AAAs were identified in a male veteran population. Mean age was 68.5 +/-7.7 years. Medical history review showed hypertension in 55%, heart disease in 73.5%, peripheral vascular disease in 21%, stroke and transient ischemic attacks in 22%, diabetes mellitus in 7%, renal insufficiency in 10%, and smoking history in 80%. The AAA size was documented with ultrasound (5.2 +/-1.3 cm, n=40) and computed tomography (5.6 +/-1.3 cm, n=100). Fifty-nine percent had angiography. Intraoperative end points included an operative time of 165 +/-6.3 minutes from incision to dressing placement. A Dacron tube graft was used in 78%, the remaining were Dacron bifurcated grafts. A suprarenal clamp was used in 8% for proximal aortic control with juxtarenal aneurysms. A pulmonary-artery catheter was placed in 69%. A transverse incision was used in 69% of patients and a midline incision was used in the rest. Estimated blood loss was 1505 +/-103 mL cell saver blood returned 754 +/-53 mL
