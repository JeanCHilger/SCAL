Aortic graft in the jejunum without bleeding. A real surprise at endoscopy. It is known that prosthetic infection, graft-duodenal fistula, and erosion are possible late complications after aortic reconstruction, and that all these reported complications are accompanied generally by variable bleeding with different presentations. We report the case of a 63-year-old man who underwent a diagnostic upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for investigation of nausea, anorexia, asthenia, fever, and mild leukocytosis. The patient's medical history included a gastric resection for ulcer, with Billroth II gastrojejunostomy reconstruction and implantation of a Dacron vascular graft for abdominal aortic aneurysm 20 years and 3 years earlier, respectively. Abdomen ultrasonography showed hypoechoic area around an aortic prosthesis. Endoscopy found a foreign body corresponding to the vascular graft at the jejunum. No signs of bleeding were recorded. The patient was hospitalized and submitted to surgery that involved extra-anatomic axillofemoral bypass, bowel resection with a gastrojejunum Roux anastomosis, and prosthesis removal.
