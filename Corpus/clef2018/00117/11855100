Aortic aneurysm and aortic regurgitation following aortic valve replacement due to Takayasu's arteritis. A 26-year-old man who underwent aortic valve replacement for aortic regurgitation due to Takayasu's arteritis 2 years earlier experienced left amaurosis persisting for some minutes. Computed tomography showed aneurysmal dilation of the ascending aorta to a diameter of 60 mm and occlusion of the left carotid artery. Cardiac echography showed perivalvular leakage. Following administration of a calcium antagonist, the patient's amaurosis subsided and brain bloodstream scintigraphy showed no abnormalities. We resected the aneurysm instead of using Bentall's operation. Following an uncomplicated postoperative course, the patient was discharged 21 days after surgery and echocardiography has shown no perivalvular leakage to date.
