Vascular complications of infective endocarditis: a retrospective analysis of 18 cases. Among 82 patients hospitalized for infective endocarditis between June 1995 and June 2001 at the cardiology B unit of the Rabat University Hospital Morocco, 18 (22%) had one or more vascular complications. We present here a retrospective analysis.The cohort included 12 men and 6 women, mean age 22 years. Infective endocarditis had grafted on a pre-existing cardiopathy among 17 patients: rheumatic heart disease (n=14), mechanical prosthetic valve (n=2), congenital heart disease (n=1).For 12 patients, vascular disease was the only complication, 1 had two complications and 4 three complications. This gave 26 lesions: 11 neurological complications, 10 arterial diseases involving the limbs including 5 mycotic aneurysms, 2 acute myocardial infarcts, 2 splenic infarcts, and 1 recurrent septic pulmonary embolism. Vascular disease was the inaugural manifestation in 9 patients and 54% of the complications occurred before the end of the second week of antibiotic treatment. Blood cultures were positive in 7 patients (40%). Oral streptococcus was isolated in 5 cases, Gram-negative bacillus in 1 case and Staphylococcus aureus in 1. Echography revealed valvular vegetations in the 16 cases of infective endocarditis on native valves: mitral (n=9), aortic (n=5), mitroaortic (n=1), tricuspid (n=1). Short term outcome was marked by 4 deaths including 3 directly related to the vascular complication.We emphasize the variable and diverse features of vascular complications of infective endocarditis. Prevention and early diagnosis are essential to institute optimal management of infective endocarditis.
