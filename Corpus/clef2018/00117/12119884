Aortic stent versus open prosthesis implantation. How can the aneurysm be excluded?. The diagnosis of an infrarenal aortic aneurysm mandates not only regular ultrasonographic monitoring, but also careful instruction of the patient about an emergency, that is, symptoms associated with rupture, and how to react. If ultrasound reveals a clear increase in the size of the aneurysm, or if a diameter of 5 cm is reached, the indication for surgery is established. Two options are then available: implantation of an aortic stent, which has the advantage of being a minimally invasive procedure, or open prosthesis implantation. However, the benefits and risks of both options must be carefully weighed up, since the patients are often elderly and have cardiopulmonary problems. Postoperative surveillance of the patient comprises three- to six-monthly follow-up with ultrasound or CT scan.
