Coarctation of the aorta in neonates and young infants: surgical experience. A retrospective analysis of repair of aortic coarctation in young infants was conducted. Between April 1997 and December 2000, 21 patients under 4 months of age underwent repair of coarctation. Their mean age and weight were 41   42 days (range, 2 to 120 days) and 3.6   0.7 kg (range, 2.6 to 4.9 kg). The indications for surgery were congestive heart failure and/or shock. Diagnosis was made by 2-dimensional echocardiography with Doppler color flow imaging. Preoperative gradients ranged from 25 to 100 mm Hg. Aortic arch hypoplasia was present in 8 patients 7 patients also had ventricular septal defect. Wide excision of the coarctation segment with extended end-to-end anastomosis was performed in 20 patients, while 1 required a Gore-Tex interposition graft between the left common carotid artery and the descending aorta. Subclavian angioplasty was performed to augment the anastomosis in 1 patient. There was no early mortality. One patient died 2 months after surgery. Follow-up examination revealed recoarctation in 5 patients (23.8%), all of whom underwent successful balloon dilatation. In conclusion, wider excision of the coarctation with extended end-to-end anastomosis reduces the chances of recoarctation. Percutaneous balloon angioplasty for treating recoarctation is effective in immediately reducing pressure gradients.
