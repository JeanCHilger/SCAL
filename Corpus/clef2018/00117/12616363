Thoracic aorta endoprosthesis: the final countdown for open surgery after traumatic aortic rupture? From December 1998 through May 2001, seven patients with thoracic aortic isthmus rupture underwent endovascular stent graft repair. Diagnosis was made by chest X-ray, transesophageal echography, CT scan, and aortography. The endoprosthesis was ordered and/or custom made on an urgent basis. During the delay period blood pressure was kept low and the tear closely monitored by means of transesophageal echography and CT scan. The mean delay period was 94 days: three patients were treated within 24 hr, two patients had their treatment postponed because of multiple organ failure, and two patients were diagnosed late. Complete exclusion of the pseudoaneurysmal sac was successful in all patients. One patient underwent a preliminary carotidosubclavian bypass because of a short proximal neck, one subclavian artery was unintentionally partially covered, and a second one was deliberately overstented. None of these patients developed arm ischemia or claudication. One patient died 3 weeks after the procedure because of the severity of associated lesions and comorbidity. Our preliminary results prove that endografting for aortic isthmic rupture is technically feasible and that it represents a safe and potentially valuable alternative to the mortality and morbidity of open surgery. Further evaluation is needed to assess the full therapeutic potential and determine the mid and long-term follow-up.
