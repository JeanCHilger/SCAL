Resection of freely mobile atheroma in the ascending aorta under circulatory arrest during coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. A 52-year-old male with a 13 years history of hemodialysis developed unstable angina. Preoperative examination revealed critical stenoses in 3 coronary arteries and extensive calcification in the ascending aorta. During urgent coronary artery bypass surgery, epiaortic ultrasonography demonstrated a large and markedly mobile atheroma in the ascending aorta. Therefore, he underwent resection of this atheroma using cardiopulmonary bypass and circulatory arrest. His postoperative course was fine. This aggressive strategy for a diseased aorta can be a viable option in selected cases. Epiaortic ultrasonography appeared to be indispensable during surgery for patients like a present one.
