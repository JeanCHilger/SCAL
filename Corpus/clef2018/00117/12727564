A comparison of 50 initial endoluminal endograft repairs for abdominal aortic aneurysm with 50 concurrent open repairs. To review the results of our initial experience with endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with respect to morbidity and mortality and to compare these outcomes with those of transabdominal repair.We reviewed the first 50 consecutive endovascular AAA repairs performed at our institution from November 1999 to January 2002. Pre-operative risk factors, intraoperative variables and post-operative outcomes were assessed. All endovascular patients were followed with periodic examination, contrast-enhanced computed tomography and/or duplex scanning. Comparison was made to 50 patients undergoing standard open repair over a similar time period.Fifty patients underwent endovascular AAA repair (mean age 72.5, AAA size 5.5 cm). Endovascular devices employed were manufactured by Ancure (Guidant Corp.), and AneuRx (Medtronic). Preoperative risk factors were similar to patients undergoing transabdominal repair. Mean operative time was 169 minutes and estimated blood loss was 450cc with average blood replacement of.18 units. Median ICU stay was 0 days and mean hospital stay was 2.3 nights. There were no conversions to open repair, however there was one aborted endovascular attempt. Morbidity included MI (2%), colon ischemia (1%), acute renal insufficiency (4%) and leg ischemia (4%). There was one death within 30 days. Seven endoleaks were identified (6 type II and 1 type I) and were managed angiographically.The short-term surgical morbidity and mortality rates for endovascular repair of AAA are acceptably low and are comparable to the transabdominal approach.
