Magnetic resonance imaging of patients with increased blood pressure and altered blood pressure response to exercise after coarctation repair. Patients successfully operated for coarctation of the aorta are frequently subjected to altered blood pressure (BP) at rest and BP response during exercise. The relationship between these variables and blood flow, peak velocity, restenosis and other morphological features of the thoracic aorta as revealed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was evaluated.Fifty-one patients subjected to coarctectomy of the aorta were examined by MRI. In addition, a control group of 23 healthy volunteers was evaluated. Morphology of the aorta was demonstrated with both ECG-triggered SE imaging and gadolinium-enhanced MR aortography. Flow-weighted MRI was applied for quantitative flow and velocity measurements.Structural alteration of the aorta was more commonly seen in those patients having increased BP at rest or altered BP response during exercise than those with a normal BP profile. The luminal diameter of the narrowest site of the aorta was decreased in all patient groups. Accordingly, the peak velocity at the corresponding site was significantly (p < 0.01) increased. However, blood flow was significantly (p < 0.01) decreased among those patients with normal BP profile compared with the other patient groups as well as the controls.Other structural changes than restenosis may contribute as well to the altered BP profile of patients subjected to coarctectomy. Reduced blood flow appears to correlate with normal BP profile, whereas the peak velocity measurements that are obtained by MRI are not able to differentiate between the patient groups. The comprehensive and reliable data obtained by non-invasive techniques, i.e. MRI and Doppler, may replace catheterization when deciding the need for intervention.
