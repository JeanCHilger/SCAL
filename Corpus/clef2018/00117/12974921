Beating heart ischemic mitral valve repair and coronary revascularization in patients with impaired left ventricular function. The aim of this study is to evaluate in a cohort of patients with impaired left ventricular (LV) function and ischemic mitral valve regurgitation (MVR), the effects of on-pump/beating heart versus conventional surgery in terms of postoperative mortality and morbidity and LV function improvement.Between January 1993 and February 2001, 91 patients with LVEF between 17% and 35% and chronic ischemic MVR (grade III-IV), underwent MV repair in concomitance with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) Sixty-one patients (Group I) underwent cardiac surgery with cardioplegic arrest, and 30 patients (Group II) underwent beating heart combined surgery. Aortic valve insufficiency was considered a contraindication for the on-pump/beating heart procedure. Mean age in Group I was 64.4 +/- 7 years and in Group II, 65 +/- 6 years (p = 0.69).The in-hospital mortality in Group I was 8 (13%) patients versus 2 (7%) patients in Group II (p > 0.1). The cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time was significantly higher in Group I (p < 0.001). In Groups I and II, respectively (p > 0.1), 2.5 +/- 1 and 2.7 +/- 0.8 grafts per patient were employed. Perioperative complications were identified in 37 (60.7%) patients in Group I versus 10 (33%) patients in Group II (p = 0.025). Prolonged inotropic support of greater than 24 hours was needed in 48 (78.7%) patients (Group I) versus 15 (50%) patients (Group II) (p = 0.008). Postoperative IABP and low cardiac output incidence were significantly higher in Group I, p = 0.03 and p = 0.027, respectively. Postoperative bleeding greater than 1000 mL was identified in 24 patients (39.4%) in Group I versus 5 (16.7%) in Group II (p = 0.033). Renal dysfunction incidence was 65.6% (40 patients) in Group I versus 36.7% (11 patients) in Group II (p = 0.013). The echocardiographic examination within six postoperative months revealed a significant improvement of MV regurgitation fraction, LV function, and reduced dimensions in both groups. The postoperative RF was significantly lower in Group II patients 12 +/- 6 (%) versus 16 +/- 5.6 (%) in Group I (p = 0.001). The 1, 2, and 3 years actuarial survival including all deaths was 91.3%, 84.2%, and 70% in Group I and 93.3%, 87.1%, and 75% in Group II (p = ns). NYHA FC improved significantly in all patients from both groups.We conclude that patients with impaired LV function and ischemic MVR may undergo combined surgery with acceptable mortality and morbidity. The on/pump beating heart MV repair simultaneous to CABG offers an acceptable postoperative outcome in selected patients.
