Influence of different pressure gradients on late clinical outcome after aortic valve replacement. Late outcome vs. hemodynamic parameters were assessed and compared in a series of 44 patients followed for 10-17 years after aortic valve replacement either with a Starr-Edwards A 1260 (SE) or a Bjork-Shiley 60 degrees (BS) prosthesis. The two groups, 22 patients each, were selected by computer from the data base SG as to be matched for age, sex, underlying lesion, date of implantation, valve size, left ventricular function, and concomitant coronary artery disease. There was no significant difference in mortality and complication rates. Clinical evaluation at a mean of 12.5 +/- 2.2 years postoperatively revealed identical findings of heart size on chest X-rays (CTR 0.50 +/- 0.04 SE vs. 0.50 +/- 0.05 BS) and nearly identical incidence of left ventricular hypertrophy on the ECG (2/22 SE and 1/22 BS). There was a statistically significant difference in Doppler ultrasonic peak pressure gradients between the two valve types (SE 32 +/- 15 mmHg, BS 23 +/- 9 mmHg p = 0.047), and of fractional shortening on M-mode echocardiograms (SE 30 +/- 9%, BS 37 +/- 8%, p = 0.038), but this was not reflected by a difference in the symptomatic status of the two groups. It is concluded, that in two groups of patients surviving 10-17 years after isolated aortic valve replacement with SE or BS valves, the statistically significant nine mmHg difference in gradient across the two valve types had no effect on long-term clinical outcome.
