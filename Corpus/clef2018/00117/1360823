Ultrasonographic screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm. To assess the prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysm in a selected group of men over the age of 60, and define main risk factors.Population based screening study.Private Norwegian health maintenance organisation.500 men over the age of 60 years.General examination by a general practitioner, together with measurements of blood glucose and serum cholesterol concentrations. Abdominal scan with a B-mode ultrasound imager.An increase in the diameter of the aorta of more than 150% over the diameter at the origin of the superior mesenteric artery, or maximum diameter of more than 29 mm. Correlation with history of smoking, serum cholesterol concentration, and general health.29 patients (5.8%) had small, and 12 (2.4%) had large, abdominal aortic aneurysms. There was a significant association between aortic aneurysm and history of smoking (p < 0.01), poor health (defined as coexistent hypertension, cardiovascular disease, or diabetes mellitus) (p < 0.01), and increasing age (p = 0.025). There was no association with hypercholesterolaemia.Ultrasonic screening of groups at risk followed by elective operation may reduce mortality of abdominal aortic aneurysm.
