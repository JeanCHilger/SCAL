Cardiorespiratory and microcirculatory effects following volume replacement using a new hydroxyethyl starch preparation. Volume therapy is often necessary in cardiac surgery to maintain stable haemodynamics. Various different hydroxyethyl starch (HAES) solutions with different concentrations, mean molecular weights, and degrees of substitution are available for this purpose. In determining the ideal type of volume therapy, not only changes in macrohaemodynamics, but also the influence on microcirculatory blood flow have to be taken into account. The efficacy of a new 10% HAES 130/0.5 solution was studied in cardiac surgery patients in comparison to a standard 10% HAES 200/0.5 preparation. METHODS. In patients scheduled for elective aortocoronary bypass grafting who had a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of less than 4 mm Hg after induction of anaesthesia, either a new 10% HAES 130/0.5 (n = 15) or a standard 10% HAES 200/0.5 solution (n = 15) was infused to double the reduced PCWP 15 patients without volume therapy served as controls (n = 15). A two-channel laser Doppler skin blood-flux monitor was used to evaluate microcirculatory alterations. Measurements of laser Doppler flux (LDF) was simultaneously performed at the patient's forehead and forearm before and after volume infusion as well as during and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). In addition, changes in gross haemodynamics were documented using a pulmonary artery catheter. Plasma viscosity and various laboratory parameters, including calculation of intrapulmonary right-to-left shunting (Qs/Qt), were also measured. RESULTS. Cardiac index (CI) increased in both volume groups (HAES 130: max. +38%
