Common femoral artery--uncommon aneurysms. Femoral artery aneurysms are rare. Their natural history, tendency to embolize or rupture are not well known.Data of all patients seen 1996-2002 with femoral artery aneurysms at the Swiss Cardiovascular Center were analysed. Nine patients with 13 aneurysms of the common femoral artery (CFA) were identified. Only true aneurysms with a diameter of at least 2.5 cm were included. All patients were male, mean age 70 years (range: 57-85 years). Four patients had bilateral femoral aneurysms. Risk factors included hypertension (9/9), smoking (7/9). One of the aneurysms was palpable in 5/9. Four patients were asymptomatic, 5 had Fontaine class II claudication. Five patients also had an aortic aneurysm (AAA), one a thoracic aneurysm and 6/9 popliteal aneurysms. In all patients, diagnosis was confirmed with duplex scan. Angiography was performed preoperatively.The aneurysms were operated on electively using aneurysm secclusion and interposition grafting. There were no significant perioperative complications. Median hospital stay was 8 days.CFA aneurysms are rare. They are palpable in nearly half of the cases. They rarely cause thrombotic or embolic complications, but are almost always connected to other aneurysms. Patients with CFA aneurysms should be screened with duplex scan. Operative therapy is straightforward, few complications can be expected. Postoperative follow-up with annual duplex scans is suggested.
