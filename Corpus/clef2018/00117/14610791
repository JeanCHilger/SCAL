Specific features of circulation in aorto-iliac arterial occlusion. On occlusion of aorto-iliac segment arteries the collateral circulation ensures an effective compensation of circulation in lower extremities and pelvic organs. The Doppler characteristics of the circulation in visceral and collateral ways of circulation are the subject of the study. The power of ultrasound duplex scanning to evaluate the regional hemodynamics on atherosclerotic occlusion of aorto-iliac segment vessels has been proved. The Doppler parameters of circulation in upper (UMA) and lower (LMA) mesenteric arteries and internal iliac artery (IIA) on high, moderate an low occlusion of abdominal part of aorta (APA) and on unilateral occlusion of iliac arteries have studied. Depending on the level and grade of extension of occlusion of main arteries the collateral circulation may increase in two or three times. Comparing volumetric velocity of circulation (VVC) in UMA and LMA in control group and in patients with low occlusion of APA an increase of VVC in the artery that has an opening situated directly near the proximal site of occlusion were revealed. These results are the evidence of functional remodelling of regional hemodynamics and of the presence of resources of collateral circulation on occlusional and stenothic lesion of aorto-iliac segment arteries.
