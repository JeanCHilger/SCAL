Carotid stenosis and peripheral artery disease in Japanese patients with coronary artery disease undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. The combination of a change in lifestyle toward Western habits and an aging society, has led to a steady increase in the incidence of atherosclerotic diseases in the Japanese population. Coronary artery disease (CAD), carotid stenosis (CS), and peripheral artery disease (PAD) are major manifestations of generalized atherosclerosis and increase the risk of cardiovascular events. However, the incidence of CS and PAD in Japanese patients with CAD is not well known, so the present study investigated this in 380 consecutive patients with CAD undergoing elective coronary aorta bypass grafting (CABG) at Kishiwada Tokushukai Hospital between October 1999 and October 2001. The coexistence of CS and PAD in all patients was preoperatively evaluated by duplex ultrasonography and the ankle - brachial index (ABI). The average age of the study population was 66.09.1 years (range, 42-87). The number of male patients was 293 (77.1%). The incidence of CS was 13.7% and 15.3% for PAD. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that no particular traditional atherosclerotic risk factor, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and smoking, was able to predict either CS or PAD, but CS and PAD were independent predictors of each other. The results of the study suggest that CS and PAD were not only highly prevalent but also strongly associated with each other in this cohort of CAD patients. Accordingly, extracoronary atherosclerotic disease should be assessed in Japanese CAD patients.
