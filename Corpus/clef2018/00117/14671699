Treatment of a late-appearing proximal type-1 endoleak after Ancure graft with an AneuRx cuff--a case report. The authors describe the case of a patient who developed a type-1 proximal endoleak 10 months after Ancure stent graft placement, despite the lack of stent migration or measurable neck dilatation. The patient had been under observation for a persistent type-2 endoleak and was noted to have an increase in his aneurysm size. The use of an uncovered stent was unsuccessful, and he required a covered proximal extension cuff. This led to a resolution of the endoleak. Implications in terms of surveillance and possible etiologies are discussed.
