A comparative study of dynamic CT and ultrasonic pulsed Doppler method for estimation of the portal blood flow. A new dynamic CT method for evaluating the portal blood flow is described. Thirty healthy volunteers were injected with non-ionic hypo-osmotic iodine contrast medium to estimate the portal blood flow. Time density curves (TD-curves) for the abdominal aorta and the main trunk of the portal vein were determined on the basis of data obtained by dynamic CT. From the TD-curves, portal blood flow coefficient and circulation time to flow into the portal vein (P-P time) were calculated. More detailed data of the TD-curves could be obtained by the new dynamic CT than by the previous methods. Subjects were simultaneously studied by an ultrasonic pulsed Doppler method which has been clinically accepted. There was a significant correlation between our dynamic CT method (portal blood flow coefficient) and the ultrasonic pulsed Doppler method concerning the measurement of portal blood flow. Therefore, it may be concluded that this CT method is reliable and clinically acceptable.
