Aortic and peripheral vascular disease: a clinician's point of view. In vascular surgery specific treatment depends on an accurate diagnosis. History of the patient and clinical examination will determine the severity of the disease and provide an approximate localization. Non-invasive tests will refine diagnosis. Mostly used nowadays are color duplex, spiral computed tomography and magnetic resonance angiography. The latter is particularly indicated in patients with renal insufficiency and contrast allergy. Regarding invasive tests intra-arterial angiography remains the gold standard for precise visualization of vascular pathology with the exception of aneurysmal disease. Endovascular ultrasonography and angioscopy are mainly used for evaluation of a specific treatment.
