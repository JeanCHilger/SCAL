Popliteal artery aneurysms. Factors associated with thromboembolism and graft failure. The purpose of this study was to review our experience with popliteal artery aneurysms (PAAS) and to identify the major factors associated with thromboembolism of PAAS and failure of grafts after surgical repair.The medical records of 38 patients with 42 PAA, who presented in a university medical center between March 1985 and September 2000, were retrospectively reviewed. Data were collected on clinical presentation, risk factors, type of reconstructions, early and late morbidity, limb loss and mortality. Duplex scan, as well as computed tomography, was performed in 33 (78.6%) cases, and preoperative angiography in 38 (90.5%). Thrombolysis was performed prior to surgical reconstruction (16.07+/-21.97 months) in 4 cases presented with acute ischemia. All patients underwent synthetic (23, 54.8%) or autogenous (19, 45.2%), below-the-knee (39, 92.9%) or above-the-knee (3, 7.1%) femoropopliteal bypass graft. The proximal and distal anastomoses were end-to-end both in both cases in 30 bypasses (71.4%). Thirty-six (86%) aneurysms were surgically treated by one vascular surgeon. Postoperative anticoagulants were given in 8 cases (19%). Long-term follow-up (mean: 57.59+/-37.77 months) was available for 35 patients (92.1%). Multivariate analysis was used to assess association between risk factors and outcome.Thirty-five patients were males, 3 were females mean age was 68.31+/-8.66 years. Risk factors were arterial hypertension (25, 69%), smoking (19, 50%), dyslipidemia (7, 18.4%) and diabetes (5, 13.2%). Thirty PAAS (71.4%) were symptomatic for acute (11, 26.2%) or chronic (7, 16.7%) ischemia, distal embolization (8, 19%), compression of the popliteal fossa (3, 7.1%) and rupture (2, 4.8%, one of which presented with acute ischemia)Our experience indicates that SFA occlusion and poor runoff vessels were independent factors associated with PAA thrombosis. The diameter of asymptomatic PAAs was not significantly different than that of asymptomatic ones. Use of tobacco and poor runoff vessels were independent factors associated with primary bypass patency. In PAAs complicated with acute ischemia, thrombolysis allowed us to regain a good runoff and to perform subsequent bypass procedure, with no amputation. The use of autogenous graft material, when possible, is recommended.
