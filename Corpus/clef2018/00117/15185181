Imaging modalities for the detection and management of endoleaks. Although endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has shown promising initial results, there are unique complications to this procedure. Endoleaks, which do not occur after traditional surgical repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms, are detected in patients undergoing EVAR and are thought by some to be one of the limitations of this procedure. Endoleaks may continue to perfuse and pressurize the aneurysm sac, thereby conferring an ongoing risk of aneurysm enlargement and/or rupture. Because of this, accurate endoleak detection and classification is essential following EVAR. Surveillance of patients is critical to determine the long-term performance of the stent grafts. Although this is usually accomplished with contrast-enhanced spiral computed tomography scans performed at regular intervals, duplex ultrasonography exams magnetic resonance angiography
