Late presentation of type A aortic arch blockage with a large type I aortopulmonary window. We report the case of a 39 day old infant, hospitalised for congenital cardiopathy associated with type A blockage of the aortic arch with a large type I aortopulmonary window. The infant was in cardiogenic shock with pulmonary systemic hypertension and a tightly stenosed arterial canal (< 2 mm). With no possibility of re-opening the arterial canal under PGE1 at this stage, complete repair was performed as an emergency. After section of the aortopulmonary window, it was closed on the pulmonary side with a patch of autologous pericardium. Repair of the aortic arch was performed without prosthetic material, under selective cerebral perfusion to protect the brain parenchyma, after mobilisation of the descending thoracic aorta, which was anastomosed directly with the distal part of the window and aortic arch. Recovery was uncomplicated, with no residual lesion at 6 month post-operative follow up. The late clinical presentation of this patient shows the effect of medical management without prior catheterisation, with operative techniques minimising peri-operative tissular ischaemia and conserving aortic and pulmonary growth potential.
