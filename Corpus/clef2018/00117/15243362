Imaging of abdominal aortic aneurysms: when, how and why?. Usually atherosclerotic in origin, aneurysms of the abdominal aorta (AAA) tend to involve the infrarenal aorta. Their biphasic exponential growth pattern, initially slow then accelerated, results in a risk of rupture. Surgical management is recommended for aneurysm diameters of 45-50mm or for growth rates more than 5mm in 6 Months. Imaging is useful for detection and follow-up of nonsurgical aneurysms, presurgical evaluation of aneurysms, and postsurgical follow-up. Frequently asymptomatic, AAA frequently is an incidental finding at the time of abdominal US. The size of the aneurysm sac, the presence of a neck and the size of the iliac arteries are assessed at the time of initial US detection. US is sufficient for follow-up of small aneurysms. Cross sectional imaging evaluation is necessary when surgery is contemplated. Readily available, multidetector row CT scanners with advanced image post-processing capabilities provide all the necessary information prior to surgical or endovascular management: evaluation of the aneurysm sac and neck, iliac and visceral arteries, and adjacent organs. Angiography with graduated catheters remains sometimes indicated. MR angiography provides results similar to CT but is less readily available and is usually reserved for patients with contraindication to iodinated contrast material. While follow-up imaging after surgical management is seldom performed, it is mandatory after endovascular management and includes KUB, Doppler US and CT or MR angiography.
