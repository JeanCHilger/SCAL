The inferior epigastric arteries as coronary bypass conduits. Size, preoperative duplex scan assessment of suitability, and early clinical experience. We are currently evaluating the inferior epigastric artery as an alternative arterial conduit for coronary bypass grafting. Fifty-seven inferior epigastric arteries were harvested from 47 adults. There were no differences in size between the right and left inferior epigastric arteries. Diameter was 2.5 to 3.5 mm proximally and 2 to 3 mm distally. Usable length was 6 to 16 cm (mean 11.2 +/- 0.25 cm). Grade I/IV atherosclerosis was found in one patient (2.1%). Duplex scanning was used for preoperative evaluation of the inferior epigastric arteries in 51 patients. In 21 patients the arteries were not harvested, in part because of duplex scan findings of small caliber or early bifurcation. In 30 patients the duplex findings could be compared with the surgical findings. The average length at operation was twice the length detected on duplex scan (11.2 cm versus 5.8 cm, p less than 0.001). There was a good correlation between diameter on duplex scan and that measured at operation (2.56 +/- 0.05 versus 2.62 +/- 0.07, p = not significant). Between December 1989 and May 1991, 38 patients (29 to 74 years, mean 56 years) received 42 inferior epigastric artery grafts. Proximal anastomoses were to the aorta in 17, to the vein graft hood in 20, or onto an internal mammary artery graft in 5. Distal anastomoses were to the left anterior descending artery in 2, the diagonal branch in 27, the marginal branch in 9, or the right coronary artery in 4. There were no early deaths. Complications included perioperative myocardial infarction in 1, deep sternal wound infection in 2, superficial infection at the harvest site of the inferior epigastric artery in 5, and reexploration for bleeding in 2. Because of its size and the low incidence of atherosclerosis, the inferior epigastric artery may evolve as an alternative arterial conduit for coronary bypass. Duplex scanning is a valuable noninvasive tool for preoperative evaluation of the artery's suitability. Long-term studies of patency of the inferior epigastric artery as a coronary bypass conduit are needed.
