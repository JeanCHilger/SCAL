Cerebral pressure autoregulation is intact and is not influenced by hypothermia after traumatic brain injury in rats. In head-injured patients and experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI), important cerebrovascular abnormalities include decreases in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and impairment of cerebral pressure autoregulation. We evaluated CBF and pressure autoregulation after fluid percussion injury (FPI) and hypothermia in rats with the hypothesis that hypothermia would ameliorate changes in posttraumatic CBF. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, intubated and mechanically ventilated, were prepared for parasagittal FPI (1.8 atm) and laser Doppler CBF flow (LDF) measurement. The abdominal aorta was cannulated for rapid removal and reinfusion of blood. Baseline autoregulatory testing in all groups consisted of LDF measurements at normothermia and a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 100 mm Hg, followed by randomly ordered changes of MAP to 80, 60, and 40 mm Hg. Animals were then randomized to one of five groups: normothermic control without FPI normothermia with FPI
