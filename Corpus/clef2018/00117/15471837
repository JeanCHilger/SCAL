Per-rectal portal scintigraphy is complementary to ultrasonography and endoscopy in the assessment of portal hypertension in children with chronic cholestasis. We evaluated the clinical usefulness of 99mTc-pertechnetate per-rectal portal scintigraphy (PPS) in the assessment of portal circulation in children with chronic cholestasis.PPS percentage shunt index (%SI) (the amount of radionuclide that shunts the liver and reaches the systemic blood after injection in the rectum) was measured in 22 children (mean age, 7.2 +/- 4.9 y) and compared with established clinical, laboratory, and endoscopic and imaging parameters of portal hypertension (PH). Fourteen children had surgically treated biliary atresia, and 8 had chronic intrahepatic cholestasis. Six clinically well children served as control subjects.The %SI was 14.3 +/- 3.1 and 34.7 +/- 18.8 in controls and in patients, respectively (P < 0.01). A cutoff of 19% correctly allocated 100% of controls and 86% of patients. Mean %SI values were significantly higher in patients with biliary atresia, a high risk of pretransplantation death, esophageal varices (EV) at endoscopy, and an abnormal value for the ratio of lesser omentum thickness to abdominal aorta diameter (LO/Ao) at ultrasonography. Correlations between %SI values and several ultrasonographic continuous variables were statistically significant only for LO/Ao ratios (r = 0.51 P = 0.005) and spleen longitudinal diameters (r = 0.53In children with chronic cholestasis, PPS may be an advantageous, minimally invasive tool complementary to ultrasonography and endoscopy for better assessment and follow-up of PH before and after liver transplantation.
