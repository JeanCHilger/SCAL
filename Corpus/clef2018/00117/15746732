Left ventricular mass regression after aortic valve replacement with 17-mm St Jude Medical mechanical prostheses in isolated aortic stenosis. The present study investigated the outcomes of aortic valve replacement with 17-mm mechanical prostheses in patients with isolated aortic stenosis.Between January 1997 and January 2003, 35 patients (mean age, 63.4 +/- 17 years median age, 70 yearsThirty-two (91.4%) patients were female, mean height was 154.4 +/- 8.3 cm, mean weight was 62.2 +/- 9.2 kg, and mean body surface area was 1.59 +/- 0.13 m 2 . The preoperative average New York Heart Association class was 2.8 +/- 0.8. The mean preoperative left ventricular mass index was 135.2 +/- 31 g/m 2 . Preoperative echocardiography showed an average gradient of 65.7 +/- 19.2 mm Hg (mean) and 103.6 +/- 30.7 mm Hg (peak) and a mean indexed effective orifice area of 0.40 +/- 0.1 cm 2 /m 2 . Echocardiographic follow-up time averaged 28.2 +/- 22.7 months (range, 13-72 months). Follow-up was 100% complete (1131.7 patient-months). Hospital mortality was 8.6% (3 patients). Actuarial 5-year survival was 94.7%. The mean postoperative New York Heart Association class was 1.13 +/- 0.34 ( P < .001), with 27 (87.1%) patients in class I and 4 patients in class II. A significant regression of the indexed left ventricular mass was found (postoperative mean value, 107.8 +/- 22.8 g/m 2  P < .0001), despite a mean indexed effective orifice area of 0.67 +/- 0.14 cm 2 /m 2 (median, 0.66 cm 2 /m 2 ).Selected patients with aortic stenosis can experience satisfactory clinical improvement and significant indexed left ventricular mass regression after aortic valve replacement with modern small-diameter bileaflet prostheses.
