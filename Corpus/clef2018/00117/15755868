Hepatic lipase C-480T genotype-dependent benefit from long-term hormone replacement therapy for atherosclerosis progression in postmenopausal women. Hepatic lipase (HL) is a lipolytic enzyme that hydrolyzes triglycerides and phospholipids in almost all major classes of lipoproteins. The HL gene has a functional promoter polymorphism at position -480, which affects transcription and leads to CC, CT, and TT genotypes. We investigated the effect of long-term hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on the progression of atherosclerosis in a 5-yr follow-up observational study of 88 postmenopausal women with different HL genotypes (CC, n = 49 CT, n = 34
