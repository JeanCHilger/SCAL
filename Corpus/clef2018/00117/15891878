Lumbar and iliac artery aneurysms in Menkes' disease: endovascular cover stent treatment of the lumbar artery aneurysm. We report lumbar and iliac artery aneurysms in a 3-month-old boy with Menkes' disease. The iliac artery aneurysm thrombosed spontaneously, documented by follow-up colour Doppler sonography. The lumbar artery aneurysm was successfully treated using a cover stent. There was no filling of the lumbar artery aneurysm and no stenosis of the cover stent during the 9-month follow-up.
