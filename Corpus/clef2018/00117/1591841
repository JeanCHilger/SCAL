Doppler assessment of prosthetic valve orifice area. An in vitro study. Although Doppler echocardiography has been shown to be accurate in assessing stenotic orifice areas in native valves, its accuracy in evaluating the prosthetic valve orifice area remains undetermined.Doppler-estimated valve areas were studied for their agreement with catheter-derived Gorlin effective orifice areas and their flow dependence in five sizes (19/20-27 mm) of St. Jude, Medtronic-Hall, and Hancock aortic valves using a pulsatile flow model. Doppler areas were calculated three ways: using the standard continuity equation using its simplified modification (peak flow/peak velocity)Doppler echocardiography using either the continuity equation or Gorlin formula allows in vitro calculation of Medtronic-Hall and Hancock effective valve orifice areas but underestimates valve areas in St. Jude valves. This phenomenon is due to localized high velocities in St. Jude valves, which do not reflect the mean velocity distribution across the orifice. Valve areas are flow independent in St. Jude and Medtronic-Hall prostheses but decrease significantly with low flow in Hancock valves, suggesting that bioprosthetic leaflets may not open fully at low flow rates.
