Abdominal aortic aneurysm screening: recommendations and controversies. Extensive level one evidence supports routine abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening in men aged 65 to 75 years, because AAAs are highly prevalent in this population. Physical examination is an insensitive means of detection. Ruptured AAAs are costly with respect to quality adjusted life years (QALY) lost and medical expenses. Large scale, randomized trials have demonstrated that AAA screening reduces all AAA-related mortality in the screened population and is cost-effective in mid-term follow-up. AAA screening by ultrasound has many advantages over other accepted medical screening programs in its simplicity in structure and the availability of an inexpensive, portable, and reliable means of screening. Additionally, AAA screening almost entirely avoids the negative consequences associated with other screening programs, including the adverse psychological effects and medical costs associated with false-positive examination results. There are subgroups of at-risk women who might benefit from AAA screening, and this issue should be further studied.
