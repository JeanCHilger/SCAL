Clinical evaluation of transtracheal Doppler for continuous cardiac output estimation. A newly developed transtracheal Doppler (TTD) computer for cardiac output determination was studied in nine patients after open heart surgery (coronary artery bypass grafting, n = 4 mitral valve replacement, n = 5). The measurements were compared with those simultaneously obtained by thermodilation. Doppler signals were adequate in 78% of the patients studied. Limited correlation between both methods (r = 0.248
