Performance of a stentless xenograft aortic bioprosthesis up to four years after implantation. Conventional biologic and mechanical prostheses have important limitations with regard to their hemodynamic characteristics and long-term durability. We evaluated the hemodynamic function of a stentless porcine aortic prosthesis in 10 patients by invasive pressure measurements and angiography with videodensitometry 8 +/- 4 days after operation, as well as by Doppler echocardiography 35 +/- 15 months after valve replacement. The early postoperative invasive study revealed a mean gradient of 8 +/- 6 mm Hg across the prosthesis, no regurgitation in eight patients, and mild regurgitation, defined as less than 20% regurgitant fraction, in the remaining two patients. The late postoperative Doppler echocardiographic study revealed a mean gradient across the aortic prosthesis of 6 +/- 3 mm Hg, mean Doppler-derived valve orifice area of 1.8 +/- 0.6 cm2, and color Doppler flow velocity mapping suggested no regurgitation in eight patients and mild regurgitation in two patients corresponding to early postoperative angiography. None of the 10 patients received anticoagulation therapy. The clinical course of all patients was without incident. This stentless aortic bioprosthesis may offer hemodynamic advantage however, further studies are needed to allow comparison with conventional mechanical and biologic prostheses.
