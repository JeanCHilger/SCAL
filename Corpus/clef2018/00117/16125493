Effect of stent implantation on upstream coronary artery compliance--a cause of late plaque rupture? Stent implantation in the rabbit aorta has been shown to increase vessel wall compliance at the inflow to the stent, but it is uncertain whether similar effects might be seen in the coronary arteries of humans and whether this would have any significant clinical consequences. First, we measured vessel compliance (systolic lumen area--diastolic lumen area/pulse pressure) before, immediately after, and at the 6-month follow-up visit at a site 5 mm upstream of the proximal edge of an implanted coronary stent in patients undergoing coronary intervention using motorized pull-back intravascular ultrasound recordings. Compliance in the upstream segment increased significantly immediately after stenting (before 7.13 +/- 1.49 vs after 10.73 +/- 1.36 mm2/mm Hg, p = 0.03), an effect that was unchanged at 6 months of follow-up (11.84 +/- 2.11 mm2/mm Hg, p = 0.08 vs before stenting). Second, we examined the site of plaque rupture in all patients presenting with an acute coronary syndrome in whom the culprit lesion was in a vessel that had had a stent implanted >12 months previously (n = 31). Plaque rupture was statistically more likely at the inflow to the stent (n = 22) than at other sites within the culprit vessel (n = 9, p <0.01). We conclude that stenting causes an increase in vessel compliance immediately proximal to the stent, and that when a vessel has been previously stented, plaque rupture is most likely to occur at the stent inflow site.
