Audit of 200 consecutive aortic aneurysm repairs carried out by a single surgeon in a district hospital: results of surgery and factors affecting outcome. It has been suggested that surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) be confined to designated centres. A prospective audit of 200 consecutive AAA repairs at a district general hospital was performed between 1981 and 1990. The 30-day mortality rates for elective, symptomatic and ruptured aneurysm repair were 1.4%, 3.5% and 30%, respectively. The major factor affecting outcome after the mode of presentation was the age of the patient, with 30-day mortality rates for emergency treatment increasing from 21% (age range 60-69 years) to 42% (age range 70-79 years). This mortality rate for ruptured aneurysms is an underestimate, with two-thirds of patients with rupture dying before reaching hospital and some patients dying in hospital undiagnosed. The major contribution to improved overall mortality would therefore be detection before rupture (usually by ultrasound) and improved diagnostic accuracy. Many patients with ruptured aneurysms had symptoms for only a short period before presentation (42% for less than 6 h) and required urgent surgery (26% reached theatre within 1 h). These two factors make long-distance transfer of these patients an unrealistic option. The concentration of this type of surgery in relatively few centres will distance the patient from their relatives and reduce the opportunity for the majority of junior doctors to acquire an understanding of the presentation, natural history and management of aortic aneurysms. This understanding when combined with a screening programme is likely to have a far greater impact on the overall mortality from AAA than restricting the centres for surgical treatment.
