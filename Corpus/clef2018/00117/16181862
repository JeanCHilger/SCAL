Rest and exercise performance of the Medtronic Advantage bileaflet valve in the aortic position. The aim of the study was to evaluate rest and exercise performance and left ventricular mass regression of the Medtronic Advantage (Medtronic, Inc, Minneapolis, MN) prosthesis in the aortic position at 1 year at a single center as part of a multicenter, prospective clinical trial.Between May 2002 and June 2003, 63 consecutive patients underwent aortic valve replacement with a Medtronic Advantage prosthesis (84.1% male mean age, 56.0 +/- 9.7 yearsOperative mortality was 0%. Valve-related complications were observed in 2 patients (endocarditis, n = 1 thromboembolic event, n = 1). There was no case of antithromboembolic hemorrhage, prosthesis-related explant, or reoperation. One patient showed moderate paravalvular regurgitation. Mean pressure gradients 1 year postoperatively ranged from 6.3 to 11.0 mm Hg across all valve sizes. Left ventricular mass regression at 1 year was 18.4% across all valve sizes (p < 0.001). No severe patient-prosthesis mismatch (effective orifice area index < or = 0.65 cm2/m2) could be observed.After 1 year, the Medtronic Advantage valve shows comparable transvalvular mean pressure gradients across the valve sizes used during rest and exercise. This is accompanied by a significant left ventricular mass regression, an important indicator for long-term survival.
