Abdominal aortic aneurysm in renal transplant recipients. Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) requiring surgical management are encountered more frequently in renal transplant recipients, presenting an important technical problem during the repair. The aim of the present study was to analyze the epidemiology and natural evolution of AAA among renal allograft recipients.Three hundred ninety-four renal transplant recipients were periodically evaluated with abdominal aortic ultrasound tomography for AAA. The indication for surgery was a maximal diameter >5 cm. Renal function, graft, and patient survival were evaluated after a mean follow-up of 51 months.Four AAA were detected in 394 renal transplant recipients, a prevalence of 1.01%. All of the AAA were found in male recipients of mean age 59.2 +/- 5.5 years and mean time posttransplantation of 82.7 +/- 77.3 months. The mean follow-up period between diagnosis and indication for surgery was 14.2 +/- 10.8 months. Two patients underwent open repair with aneurysmectomy and conventional tube graft positioning, and 2 patients refused surgical repair. To preserve renal graft function during the aortic cross-clamping phase, cold perfusion with 4 degrees C Ringer acetate and local hypothermia with sterile ice were used. Renal function did not change after the operation (preoperative serum creatinine levels were 1.2 and 1.3 mg/dL postoperative 1.3 and 1.5 mg/dL respectively). The 2 patients who underwent surgery are alive with excellent graft functioning after a follow-up of 1.5 and 7 years, respectively. The 2 patients who refused surgical treatment are dead.Yearly ultrasound screening for AAA must be recommended in renal transplant recipients as part of the routine posttransplantation follow-up. De novo AAA occurs in younger subject in the transplant population and shows a faster evolution.
