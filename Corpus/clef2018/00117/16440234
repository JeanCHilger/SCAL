A case of missing mitral valve leaflet: radiological detection. Intravascular foreign bodies may be introduced into the circulation as a complication of minimally invasive or interventional techniques, or during cardiac valve surgery. Prosthetic heart valve leaflets have been rarely described as intravascular foreign bodies. Herein we report a case of prosthetic heart valve leaflet embolization to the aortic bifurcation with computed tomography and ultrasonography findings, and the importance of radiographic imaging in the localization of missing leaflet fragment is pointed out.
