Acute aortic dissection in a 34 year old pregnant woman--a case report. A case of a 34 year old pregnant woman at 38 weeks gestation, who was admitted to the hospital with acute chest pain, is presented. Electrocardiogram showed ST segment changes suggestive of acute myocardial infarction. Echocardiography, however, revealed acute aortic dissection. The patient was transferred to another hospital where caesarean section followed by cardiac surgery were successfully performed. A subsequent one-year follow-up period was uneventful, both for mother and child. Diagnosis and treatment of acute aortic dissection during pregnancy are discussed.
