Statins are associated with a reduced infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm growth. To evaluate the effect of statins on aneurysm growth in a group of consecutive patients under surveillance for infrarenal aortic aneurysms (AAA).All patients (59 statin users, 91 non-users) under surveillance between January 2002 and August 2005 with a follow-up for aneurysm growth of at least 12 months and a minimum of three diameter evaluations were retrospectively included in the analysis. Multiple regression analysis, weighted with the number of observations, was performed to test the influence of statins on AAA growth rate.During a median period of 3.1 (1.1-13.1) years the overall mean aneurysm growth rate was 2.95+/-2.8 mm/year. Statin users had a 1.16 mm/year lower AAA growth rate compared to non-users (95% CI 0.33-1.99 mm/year). Increased age was associated with a slower growth (-0.09 mm/year per year, p = 0.003). Female gender (+1.82 mm/year, p = 0.008) and aneurysm diameter (+0.06 mm/year per mm, p = 0.049) were associated with increased AAA growth. The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, chronic lung disease, or other cardiovascular risk factors were not independently associated with AAA growth.Statins appear to be associated with attenuation of AAA growth, irrespective of other known factors influencing aneurysm growth.
