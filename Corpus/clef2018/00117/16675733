Nonpulsatile cerebral perfusion in patient with acute neurological deficits. An extremely low pulsatile cerebral perfusion can result in a massive cerebral infarction and poor outcome. We report a patient who had complete recovery from initial neurological deficits in spite of nonpulsatile perfusion in the middle cerebral artery.We used carotid duplex and transcranial Doppler to evaluate cerebral hemodynamics and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) to score the neurological deficits.A 62-year-old man had a sudden chest pain and right hemispheric symptoms with NIHSS score of 18 on arrival. Carotid duplex showed no blood flow in the right common carotid artery. Transcranial Doppler showed a nonpulsatile waveform with slow antegrade flow in right middle cerebral artery. Chest CT angiography revealed type A aortic dissection. After surgical repair for the aortic dissection with brain retroperfusion, the patient had dramatic recovery from the initial neurological deficit, and normal pulsatile cerebral perfusion in the right carotid territory.Nonpulsatile cerebral perfusion points to a proximal source of arterial flow obstruction that may necessitate interventional treatment or surgery in order to restore brain perfusion and potentially reverse impending stroke.
