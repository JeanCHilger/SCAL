Does hemophilia protect against atherosclerosis? A case-control study. Whether carriers of hemophilia are protected against the development of atherosclerosis is controversial. In a case-control study, the presence of atherosclerosis was assessed and quantified with echo-color Doppler of all explorable arterial districts in 50 carriers of hemophilia and in 50 age-matched control individuals. All participants submitted to echo-color Doppler of carotid and femoral axis, of brachial arteries, and of the abdominal aorta. The presence and grade of atherosclerotic plaques were assessed, as well as the intima-media thickness (IMT). At least one atherosclerotic plaque was found in six cases (12.0%) versus 15 controls (30.0%) referring to the total number of plaques, 30% of them were evaluated in patients affected by decreased coagulation while 70% in subjects with normal levels of FVIII. In all the examined districts, the mean IMT was significantly lower in patients with hemophilia than in controls. Hemophilia protects against asymptomatic atherosclerosis.
