Acute supravalvular aortic stenosis following the replacement of the ascending aorta. We report a very rare case of ascending aortic replacement complicated by acute supravalvular aortic stenosis. A 53-year-old man was referred to our Institution for evaluation of a systolic murmur and congestive heart failure. He had undergone elective ascending aortic replacement one month previously due to acute type A aortic dissection. On admission, transesophageal echocardiography revealed a proximal leak with a pseudoaneurysm compressing the aortic graft and generating a systolic gradient of 84 mmHg. The patient underwent reoperation, the graft was removed and a new Dacron graft was put in place.
