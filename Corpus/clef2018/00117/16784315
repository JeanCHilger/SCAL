Aortoiliac kissing stents: long-term results and analysis of risk factors affecting patency. To present the early and long-term results of aortoiliac kissing stents implantation and evaluate the risk factors affecting patency.The data were retrospectively reviewed on 68 patients (64 men mean age 55+/-11, range 32-77) who underwent kissing stents implantation during a 12-year period. The majority of patients (64, 94%) had claudicationAll procedures were technically and clinically successful. Complications occurred in 12%, but none required surgery. The follow-up period was 35+/-31 months. Primary, assisted primary, and secondary patency rates, respectively, were 76%, 90%, and 94% at 1 year 63%, 86%, and 92% at 3 yearsImplantation of kissing stents is a safe and effective alternative in the treatment of aortoiliac obstructions. However, overall primary and assisted primary patency rates are inferior to those reported for surgery. Long-term patency comparable to surgery may be obtained in patients >50 years and in those without an iliac occlusion, particularly if a favorable stent configuration is achieved.
