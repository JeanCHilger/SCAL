The usefulness of ultrasonography and Doppler ultrasound in renal transplantation. The aim of the study is to analyze the usefulness of ultrasound and Doppler ultrasound for the evaluation of transplant donors and recipients, for renal transplant follow-up and for the resolution of surgical complications after renal transplant.Abdominal ultrasound was performed in donors and recipients of renal grafts. In the recipients with vascular risk factors a Doppler ultrasound of the iliac and lower limb arteries was systematically done. Doppler ultrasound was performed in the first and seventh day after renal transplant, as well as for graft dysfunction at any moment.Recipient ultrasound informs about the existence of acquired renal cystic disease and Doppler ultrasound allows evaluating the vascular state of high risk recipients. In the immediate post-transplant period ultrasound studies are useful for detection of vascular complications, graft obstruction and to control the evolution of acute rejection and acute tubular necrosis. Finally, ultrasound is the technique of choice in the endourological management of surgical complications after renal transplant.Ultrasound under urologic control is essential in the evaluation of the kidney transplant recipient, post-transplant follow-up and in the resolution of surgical complications.
