Percutaneous angioplasty of native coarctation of the aorta. Results in children and young adults. The authors report the experience of one centre in the treatment of native coarctation of the aorta by percutaneous angioplasty. Between 1999 and August 2005, 22 patients (7 girls, 15 boys) underwent dilatation of their coarctation by a balloon catheter at an average age of 11.8 +/- 5 years and body weight of 44 +/- 21 kg. In 20 patients, balloon angioplasty alone was performed and, in the other two, the angioplasty was associated with the insertion of a covered CP stent. The dilatation was performed with a balloon/coarctation ratio of 2.18 +/- 0.6 (1.7 to 3.5) and a balloon/isthmus ratio of 1.0 +/- 0.23 (0.7 to 1.87). After the procedure, ascending aortic pressure decreased from 134.7 +/- 23.4 mmHg to 125 +/- 22.7 mmHg (p= 0.0003) descending aortic pressure increased from 93.4 +/- 14.9 mmHg to 104.8 +/- 21.7 mmHg (p= 0.003)
