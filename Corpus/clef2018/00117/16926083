Determinants of functional outcome after revascularization for critical limb ischemia: an analysis of 1000 consecutive vascular interventions. When reporting standards for successful lower extremity revascularization were established, it was assumed that arterial reconstruction, patency, and limb salvage would correlate with the ultimate goal of therapy: improved functional performance. In reality, factors determining improvement of ambulation and maintenance of independent living status after revascularization have been poorly studied. The purpose of this study was to assess the important determinants of functional outcome for patients after intervention for critical limb ischemia.The results of 1000 revascularized limbs from 841 patients were studied. Indications were rest pain, 41.1% ischemic ulceration, 35.6%At 5 years, 72.4% of the entire cohort had a patent reconstruction and 72.1% had an intact limb. Overall 5-year functional outcomes were 41.9% for survival, 70.6% for maintenance of ambulation, and 81.3% for independent living status. Outcome was not significantly affected by the type of treatment (endovascular or open surgery) or by the level of disease treated (aortoiliac, infrainguinal, or both). The most important independent, statistically significant predictors of particularly poor functional outcome were impaired ambulatory ability at the time of presentation (70% 5-year mortality, hazard ratio, 3.34 39.5% failure to eventually ambulate, hazard ratio, 2.83Functional outcome for patients undergoing intervention for critical limb ischemia is not solely determined by the traditional measures of reconstruction patency and limb salvage, but also by certain intrinsic patient comorbidities at the time of presentation. These findings question the benefit of our current approach to critical limb ischemia in functionally impaired, chronically ill patients--patients who undoubtedly will be more prevalent as our population ages.
