Abdominal aortic aneurysm screening using non-imaging hand-held ultrasound volume scanner--a pilot study. Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) is cost-effective and timely repair improves outcome. Using standard ultrasound (US) an AAA can be accurately diagnosed or ruled-out. However, this requires training and bulk equipment.To evaluate the diagnostic potential of a new hand-held ultrasound bladder volume indicator (BVI) in the setting of AAA screening.In total, 94 patients (66 +/- 14 years, 67 men) referred for atherosclerotic disease were screened for the presence of AAA (diameter > 30 mm using US). All patients underwent both examinations, with US and BVI. Using the BVI, aortic volume was measured at 6 pre-defined points. Maximal diameters (US) and volumes (BVI) were used for analyses.In 54 (57%) patients an AAA was diagnosed using US. The aortic diameter by US correlated closely with aortic volume by BVI (r = 0.87, p < 0.0001). Using a cut-off value of > or = 50 ml for the presence of AAA by BVI, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of BVI in detection of AAA were 94%, 82%, 88% and 92%, respectively. The agreement between the two methods was 89%, kappa 0.78.The bladder volume indicator is a promising tool in screening patients for AAA.
