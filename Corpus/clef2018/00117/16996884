Comparison of feasibility and accuracy of transthoracic echocardiography versus computed tomography in patients with known ascending aortic aneurysm. Aortic valve diseases, hypertension, and connective tissue disorders may be causes of ascending aortic aneurysms. Aortic enlargement monitoring is essential for surgical timing and for operative design. In this regard, several imaging techniques may have limitations: magnetic resonance is not widespread and is expensive, computed tomography uses radiation, and transesophageal echocardiography is a semi-invasive method. The aim of this study was to analyze the feasibility of transthoracic echocardiography in the evaluation of aortic dimensions and its accuracy in comparison with multidetector computed tomography. In 44 patients with known ascending aortic aneurysms, transthoracic echocardiographic and computed tomographic measurements were obtained and compared at different levels: the annulus, sinuses of Valsalva, sinotubular junction, ascending aorta, and aortic arch. Transthoracic echocardiographic diameters were obtained in all patients, apart from the aortic arch, which was measured in 40 cases. Transthoracic echocardiographic and computed tomographic diameters correlated significantly (p <0.001), with very small SEEs: for the annulus, r = 0.846 (SEE 0.37) for the sinuses of Valsalva, r = 0.967 (SEE 0.35)
