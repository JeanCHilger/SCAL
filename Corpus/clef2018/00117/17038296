Aneurysm sac pressure measurement with a pressure sensor in endovascular aortic aneurysm repair. Aortic endograft surveillance is a necessity for the lifetime of a patient owing to the risk of endoleaks and device complications. The current standard of care for surveillance is radiologic imaging. The most commonly used modality is computed tomographic angiography. Magnetic resonance angiography and ultrasonography have also been used as surveillance tools. These imaging techniques have risks and limitations, and alternative surveillance tools are being investigated. Remote pressure sensing is a promising technology that can provide adjunctive support to the current imaging modalities. The technology is applicable to both abdominal and thoracic endograft implantation and surveillance. It has recently gained clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration for acute aneurysm exclusion during an abdominal endograft insertion. As more data are accumulated, it may be possible for remote pressure sensing to replace current imaging techniques as the sole modality for endograft surveillance.
