Direct intrahepatic cavo-portal shunts in Budd-Chiari syndrome: Role of simultaneous fluoroscopy and trans-abdominal ultrasonography. Transjugular intrahepatic porto-systemic shunt (TIPS) for Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) can be inserted from inferior vena cava or hepatic vein to portal vein. The former is performed when hepatic veins are not suitable and is technically more challenging.In this retrospective study, 7 patients with chronic BCS needed cavo-portal shunt as hepatic veins were neither amenable to plasty nor provided access for TIPS placement. Simultaneous fluoroscopic and trans-abdominal ultrasound guidance was used at the time of portal vein puncture.Technical success and clinical improvement were obtained in all patients. Median 3 (range 1-4) attempts were needed to puncture the portal vein. There were no significant complications. Uncovered stents were used in six patients and stent occlusion was common, but could be managed by re-intervention.Cavo-portal shunt is an effective technique for patients with BCS uncontrolled by medical therapy. Additional trans-abdominal ultrasound in oblique parasagittal plane keeps the procedure safe.
