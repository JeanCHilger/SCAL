Acute popliteal arterial occlusion during extracorporeal circulation. A 79-year-old man underwent aortic arch replacement for thoracic aortic aneurysm. He had a history of smoking, coronary stenting for ischemic heart disease and replacement with artificial blood vessel for abdominal aortic aneurysm. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with midazolam, fentanyl, sevoflurane, and vecuronium. A 20 gage catheter was placed in the right radial artery and a 22 gage catheter in the left posterior tibial artery. Total circulatory arrest under profound hypothermia and retrograde cerebral perfusion were performed using extracorporeal circulation. After finishing anastomosis with artificial blood vessel, he was weaned from extracorporeal circulation. The pressure in the left posterior tibial artery was maintained at 15 mmHg, although the blood pressure in the right radial artery increased gradually. Then, the pressure in the left femoral artery in the operative field was the same as the pressure in the right radial artery. Therefore, we suspected the arterial line occlusion of the left posterior tibial artery. After the operation, we found the left leg and foot pale and cold with no pulsation on the left popliteal, dorsal pedis, and posterior tibial arteries. Further, acute left popliteal arterial occlusion was assessed by means of Doppler and left lower extremity angiography. We immediately performed the balloon-catheter embolectomy. However, as he developed compartment syndrome on the left lower limb due to reperfusion injury postoperatively, fascitomy was performed. On the 58th postoperative day, he was discharged from our hospital. Measurement by Doppler is useful for the early diagnosis of the lower leg arterial occlusion.
