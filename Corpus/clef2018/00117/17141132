Computed tomography aortic three-dimensional reconstruction: An invaluable tool for diagnosis of juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. Accurate mapping of the aortic aneurysm in relation to the renal artery is pivotal in the success of abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Currently, contrast computed tomography (CT), a method of combining both angiography and CT scan, is being used in the evaluation and diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm. We report a series of cases in which contrast CT alone gave us misleading information on the true nature of the aneurysm in relation to the renal arteries. We conclude that the three-dimensional spiral CT reconstructed model provides better morphologic information for clinical decision-making than contrast CT alone.
