The treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms by use of endovascular prosthesis and classic vascular prosthesis. The abdominal aortic aneurysm is a dilatation of infrarenal part of aorta. Its ethiology is still unknown. An infection and congenital disorders of conjunctive tissue are regarded as the main risc factors. Other factors could be a perimural thrombus and elastin and colagen degradation. It's not proved that atheromatosis is a risc factor. The disease concerns mainly the old males. Not treated aneurysm grows until rupture. The aneurysms are usually asympthomatic. Majority of them are found incidentally. Ultrasonography and computed tomography are used to extended diagnosis. The open surgery or endovascular surgery are only possible ways of treatment. The aneurysm with diameter over 55 milimeters, sympthomatic or rupted is an indication for surgery. The aim of the open surgery is implantation of the vascular prosthesis into retroperitoneal space. Endovascular method consist in placement of stent-graft in the lumen of aneurysm through small incision in a peripherial vessel. Stent-graft consists of metal chassis covered by classic vascular prosthesis. This method still requires the long-term assessment.
