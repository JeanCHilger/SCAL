Endovascular repair of chronic mesenteric occlusive disease: the role of duplex surveillance. Chronic occlusive mesenteric ischaemia can be treated surgically or endovascularly. Endovascular techniques as elsewhere in the vascular tree are limited by restenosis. The aim of this study was to determine if duplex ultrasound proven restenosis correlates with recurrence of symptoms.Our study looks at successful percutaneous revascularization of the mesenteric circulation associated proven restenosis using colour Doppler ultrasound and the relation to recrudescence of symptoms or weight loss. A retrospective review of five patients treated endovascularly at our institution for mesenteric angina secondary to visceral artery stenosis was carried out.Technical success was achieved in four out of the five patients in our study. One patient had a procedure complicated by thrombus in the coeliac axis and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) stents, subsequently showed SMA occlusion and 90% stenosis of the CA and inferior mesenteric artery and required an aorto-mesenteric graft. Three of the four patients with a technically successful procedure had significant (>70%) restenosis of the SMA. All three, including one patient with both SMA restenosis and chronic inferior mesenteric artery occlusion, remain asymptomatic and have maintained their postprocedural weight gain.Although ultrasound is a convenient, non-invasive tool for follow up of endovascular treatment of mesenteric stenosis, its use is unclear as in our study restenosis did not correlate with recrudescence of symptoms.
