Lymphocele following renal transplantation. We attempt in this retrospective study to evaluate the incidence, clinical presentations, and outcome of lymphocele in renal transplant recipients. 528 patients (313 males and 215 females) have received renal allografts from 384 living and 144 cadaveric donors. Diagnosis of lymphocele was made basically by ultrasound examination, and symptomatic collections were drained either percutaneously or into the peritoneal cavity. There were 50 (9.5%) instances of lymphocele encountered between 2 weeks and 6 months after transplantation. The lymphocele presented clinically predominantly as a single pelvi-abdominal swelling in 28 (56%) cases or as a swelling associated with manifestations of utereric and/or venous compression in 18 (36%) cases, and it was more common after cadaveric transplantation. All the cases of lymphocele were successfully treated with no graft loss. Lymphocele is an uncommon complication after renal transplantation, and is formed during the early post transplantation period. If not treated, it could seriously affect the kidney function. Intraperitoneal drainage is the most effective method for the treatment of symptomatic lymphocele.
