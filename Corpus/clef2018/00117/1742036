Unruptured noncoronary sinus of Valsalva aneurysm: preoperative characterization by transesophageal echocardiography. We describe a patient with a large unruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm that was discovered incidentally. Transesophageal echocardiography was used to characterize the aneurysm preoperatively, and was helpful intraoperatively in assessment of the degree of native aortic valvular regurgitation after repair. The use of transthoracic echocardiography, contrast echocardiography, Doppler echocardiography, and transesophageal echocardiography are discussed in this condition.
