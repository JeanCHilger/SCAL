Acalculous candida cholecystitis: a complication of critical surgical illness. Four patients with underlying diseases including multiple trauma, aortic graft infection, and complex fistulae developed acute acalculous cholecystitis with bile cultures positive only for Candida albicans. The primary site of the candida infection included urinary tract, gastrointestinal tract, and an aortic graft in one patient each and was undetermined in the trauma victim. All had received broad-spectrum antibiotics three of the four were in the intensive care unit (ICU) with organ failure. Ultrasonography showed a thickened gallbladder wall in three patients and sludge in one. Hepato-iminodiacetic acid scans were nonvisualizing in these three patients. Operative findings included gangrenous cholecystitis in two patients and edematous cholecystitis in one. The fourth patient was treated with percutaneous cholecystostomy and interval cholecystectomy. The interval from the onset of symptoms to recognition of the need for operation was an average of 7 days. Two of the four patients died of ongoing sepsis. Candida cholecystitis is a life-threatening complication of critical surgical illness. Risk factors are similar to those for candida infection elsewhere and include antibacterial therapy, complex fistulae, disseminated malignancy, immunosuppression, and prolonged ICU stay. A high index of suspicion for this fungal pathogen and aggressive surgical therapy offer the only chance for a favorable outcome.
