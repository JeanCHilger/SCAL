Double tube stent-grafts for infrarenal aortic aneurysm: a new concept. To present the concept of double tube stent-grafts and examine the indications for and results achieved with these devices.From January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2005, 759 patients who underwent endovascular repair of infrarenal aortic aneurysms at 2 centers. Of these, 45 (5.9%) patients received a double tube stent-graft complete operative and follow-up data were available for retrospective analysis in 41 patients (33 menThe postoperative complication rate was 12.2%, with 2.4% systemic complications (1 patient with angina pectoris) the early mortality rate was 0%. Mean follow-up was 21.9+/-12.8 months (range 12-61) for the 41 patients. Four (9.8%) patients died during follow-up of cardiac causes (n = 2), lung cancer (n = 1), and bowel ischemia (n = 1). Four (9.8%) endoleaks were observed during follow-up: 1 distal type I, 2 type II, and 1 type III. Maximum aneurysm diameters shrank from 52.0+/-9.5 mm preoperatively to 44.0+/-10.9 mm (p<0.0001) postoperatively at the latest available follow-up.Our study supports the use of this double tube technique for repair of appropriate saccular infrarenal aortic aneurysms. The double tube stent-graft method appears safe in terms of endoleaks and migration, so we recommend that it be considered an option of endovascular aortic aneurysm therapy.
