Laparoscopic repair of Morgagni hernia and cholecystectomy in a 40-year-old male with Down's sindrome. Report of a case. Morgagni-Larrey hernia (MH) is an unusual diaphragmatic hernia of the retrosternal region. Few cases of MH, treated laparoscopically, associated with Down's syndrome (DS) have been reported in literature. On October 2004, a DS 40-year-old male was admitted to our Department with mild abdominal pain and nausea. Hematochemical tests were within the normal range. Ultrasonography showed biliary sludge and multiple gallstones. Chest X-ray revealed a right-sided paracardiac mass that appeared as MH after a thoraco-abdominal computed tomography (CT). Four trocars were placed as a routinary cholecystectomy. Abdominal exploration confirmed the presence of a voluminous hernia through a wide diaphragmatic defect (12 cm) on the left side of the falciform ligament, containing the last 20 cm ileal loops and right colon with the third lateral of transverse. After retrograde cholecystectomy and reduction of the herniated ileo-colonic tract from multiple adherences, the defect was repaired with an interrupted 2/0 silk suture and then a running 2/0 polypropylene suture. Postoperative course was complicated by pulmonary edema but subsequently the patient was discharged without further complications and has no recurrence after 2 years. In conclusion, surgery is necessary for symptomatic MH and to prevent possible severe complications. We preferred laparoscopy for the reduced morbidity compared to laparotomy, even if in our case the postoperative course was not uneventful. There are still few comparative data about the modality of closure of the defect between primary repair with nonabsorbable suture material, in case of small defects, or continuous monofilament suture or prosthesis in case of large defects.
