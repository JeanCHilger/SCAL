Hydrogel-mediated release of basic fibroblast growth factor from a stent-graft accelerates biological fixation with the aortic wall in a porcine model. To evaluate the local reaction of the aortic wall induced by basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) released from a gelatin hydrogel coated on the outer surface of a stent-graft for the purpose of biological fixation.A total of 18 nitinol-based, polyester-covered stent-grafts were implanted in 6 porcine aortas for 1 month. The implanted stent-grafts were divided into 3 groups: the control group (uncoated), the hydrogel group (coated with hydrogel containing water), and the bFGF group (coated with hydrogel containing bFGF). After stent-graft implantation, the results of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and qualitative and quantitative microscopic examinations were compared among the groups.In the bFGF group, a thin white lamellar tissue was observed on IVUS images. Significantly more new intimal tissue formation was observed in all the bFGF group animals than in the other 2 groups, and alpha smooth muscle (SM) actin-positive cells (alphaSMCs) were detected in this new tissue. The alphaSMCs within the fabric of tightly woven grafts were significantly more abundant in the bFGF group than in the other groups.The local controlled release of bFGF from the stent-graft significantly accelerated the proliferation of new intimal tissue between the aorta and the stent-graft and within the graft materials. These findings suggest that a graft can be fixed biologically to the aortic wall, which may contribute to the shrinkage of aneurysms following stent-grafting.
