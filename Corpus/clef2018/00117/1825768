Minimal access surgery and the future of interventional laparoscopy. Minimal access surgery is intended to minimize the trauma of access without compromising exposure of the operative field. Its major benefits include diminished cost of therapy due to a reduced hospital stay and accelerated recovery with early return to full activity. The approaches used in minimal access surgery are laparoscopic, endoluminal, perivisceral, intra-articular, and combined. Many abdominal and thoracic procedures are being adapted to the minimal access approach. Developmental requirements include improvements in light delivery systems three-dimensional television imaging
