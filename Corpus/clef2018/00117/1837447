Surgical results in stage 2 arterial diseases. The results of surgical treatment of peripheral artery disease at the stage of intermittent claudication may now be assessed with a 40 year follow-up. In selected cases the 10 year patency rate of aortoiliac revascularisation is 90% and the 5 year patency rate of femoropopliteal revascularisation is 85%. When the indications are widened to include less favourable lesions giving rise to severe claudication, the patency rate falls to 60% at 5 years. These results should improve with better preoperative assessment by Doppler ultrasonography the use of new material and methods (endovascular) and stricter control of the revascularisation procedure by angioscopy in patients with severe effort ischaemia which is the principal surgical indication the association of endovascular revascularisation procedures has increased the therapeutic indications and improved the functional result.
