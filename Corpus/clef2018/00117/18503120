Contrast-enhanced ultrasound versus CT and operative findings in evaluation of renal vein aneurysm with AV fistula. We report the case of a 61-year-old patient admitted to our hospital owing to recent nonspecific abdominal pain. Five years earlier he had been treated with a graft owing to thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysm with dissection. He now showed a left renal vein aneurysm with a diameter of 11x7.5 cm. This case demonstrates that contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), employed in addition to computed tomography angiography, offers a promising new option for diagnosis and preoperative treatment planning in patients with abdominal vascular diseases. The results were compared with operative findings.
