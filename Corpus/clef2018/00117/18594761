Indications for the use of the Amplatzer vascular plug in interventional radiology. This study was undertaken to assess the indications and effectiveness of the Amplatzer vascular plug (AVP) system in interventional radiology.Over the past year, we selected 12 patients (seven men and five women mean age 65.8 years, range 45-82) for the occlusion of five internal iliac arteries (in three aortoiliac aneurysms, one internal iliac aneurysm and one isolated common iliac artery aneurysm), two common iliac arteries (in two ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms), two subclavian arteries (in aortic arch aneurysms) and three splenic artery aneurysms. We used 15 AVPs (splenic artery aneurysms were excluded, with one AVP in the feeding vessel and one in the draining vessel).We achieved immediate technical success in 12/12 cases. No rupture or dissection of the treated arteries occurred. During the follow-up (mean 4.6 months, range 3-6) computed tomography (CT) angiography and/or contrast-enhanced ultrasound demonstrated complete artery occlusion and aneurysm exclusion.Ease and speed of use combined with precise, controlled delivery justify the growing use of the AVP in interventional radiology. No doubt, the system's versatility will extend its indications, and larger studies with longer follow-up periods will validate the results achieved so far.
