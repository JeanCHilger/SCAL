Errors in pressure gradient measurement by continuous wave Doppler ultrasound: type, size and age effects in bioprosthetic aortic valves. The accuracy of continuous wave Doppler ultrasound in deriving pressure gradients across bioprosthetic heart valves was evaluated in an in vitro pulse duplicator. Simultaneous pressure transducer and Doppler measurements were made in new and explanted aortic bioprosthetic valves of several sizes and four types: Carpentier-Edwards, Ionescu-Shiley, Hancock standard and Hancock modified. The mean and peak gradients calculated by the modified Bernoulli equation from Doppler velocity measurements were always greater than those measured manometrically, despite corrections for location dependence of the manometric gradient (or pressure recovery). The relation between manometric and ultrasonically determined gradient was found to be statistically dependent on the valve type (mean gradient p less than 0.0001 peak gradient p = 0.0003) and size (mean gradient p = 0.0089
