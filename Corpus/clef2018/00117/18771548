A novel approach to assess aortic stiffness related to changes in aging using a two-dimensional strain imaging. Recently, it has been demonstrated that aortic stiffness is associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The objective of the present study was to accurately evaluate the aortic stiffness relative to the changes in aging using two-dimensional (2D) strain imaging in 39 comparatively normal patients (15-85 years).We obtained short-axis images of the abdominal aorta (Ao) and determined the peak circumferential strain (Ao-S) and strain rate (Ao-SR) and the time from Q-wave of electrocardiogram to peak Ao-S using the 2D strain imaging. The stiffness parameters beta(1) and beta(2) of the abdominal aorta were measured using M-mode ultrasonography and 2D strain imaging, respectively.The stiffness parameters beta(1) and beta(2) correlated significantly with age (r=0.51, P < 0.001 and r=0.69, P < 0.0001, respectively), particularly the latter parameter beta(2). The peak circumferential Ao-S and Ao-SR correlated strongly with age (r=-0.79, P < 0.0001 and r=-0.87, P < 0.0001, respectively). The stiffness parameter beta(1) was significantly greater in the old-aged group (>60 years) than in the young-aged group (<30 years). The peak circumferential Ao-S and Ao-SR were significantly lower in the middle-aged (30-60 years) and old-aged groups than in the young-aged group.The aortic circumferential strain and strain rate measured by 2D strain imaging allow simple and accurate determination of the aortic stiffness.
