Prosthetic aortic valve dysfunction due to projection of the left ventricular outflow septum. Prosthetic valve dysfunction at the aortic position is generally caused by either pannus overgrowth or thrombus or both. We encountered a case with prosthetic valve dysfunction who had undergone an aortic valve replacement 4 years and 5 months before, receiving SJM-HP 21 mm. During the initial operation, a prosthetic valve was implanted parallel to the ventricular septum and slightly up toward the non-coronary sinus (Olin technique) because of a narrow aortic annulus. Before re-do surgery, Doppler echocardiography and cinefluoroscopy showed an incomplete opening of 1 leaflet of the prosthetic valve. At the re-do operation, it was observed that the movement of the anterior leaflet of the prosthetic valve was disturbed by the projecting ventricular septum. After the projecting ventricular septum was excised, SJM-regent 17 mm valve was implanted perpendicular to the septum at the supra-annular position. Postoperative course was uneventful. The postoperative aortic peak pressure gradient decreased to 25 mmHg by Doppler echocardiography.
