Aortic valve replacement: ten-year follow up of the Ross procedure. The study aim was to assess the long-term results of the Ross procedure in the treatment of aortic valve disease.Between July 1995 and May 2006, a total of 165 patients (131 males, 34 females mean age 39 +/- 13 years) underwent the Ross procedure using the freestanding root technique. Both, clinical and echocardiographic follow ups were conducted, with valve-associated events (death, endocarditis, thromboembolism, reoperation, valvular dysfunction) being analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves. Log-rank tests, chi-square tests and the Cox model were used for variable analysis.The mean preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction was 55 +/- 12%. Surgery was indicated for aortic stenosis (54%) or aortic insufficiency (46%). The aortic valve was bicuspid in 125 patients, while in four patients surgery was indicated in the setting of active infective endocarditis, and in six for prosthetic dysfunction. The in-hospital mortality was 2.5% (n = 4). Survival at one and 10 years was 97% (95% CI, 93-99) and 94.8% (95% CI, 89-98), respectively. Freedom from endocarditis at 10 years was 95% (95% CI, 84-98), and from valve-related events was 95% (95% CI, 90-98) and 88% (95% CI, 75-94) at one and 10 years, respectively. Four patients required reoperation (one case of recurrent mitral regurgitation after previous mitral valve repair three cases of autograft dysfunction and disease of other valves). Based on this experience, and during the follow up period, the presence of aortic regurgitation as a baseline aortic lesion was not associated with any need for reoperation.As a surgical technique, the Ross procedure has a low event rate at 10 years after surgery, and may be considered a valid alternative for the treatment of aortic valve disease.
