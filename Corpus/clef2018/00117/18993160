Doppler-catheter discrepancies in patients with bileaflet mechanical prostheses or bioprostheses in the aortic valve position. The aims of the present study were to investigate in vivo Doppler-catheter discrepancies in aortic bileaflet mechanical and stented biologic valves and evaluate whether these can be predicted using Doppler echocardiography. Results of in vitro studies of bileaflet mechanical valves suggested overestimation using Doppler gradients. Findings in stented biologic valves were conflicting. Patients who underwent valve replacement with a St. Jude Medical mechanical (n = 14, size 19 to 29) or a St. Jude Medical Biocor (Biocor, n = 13, size 21 to 25) valve were included. Simultaneous continuous Doppler recordings (transesophageal transducer) and left ventricular and aortic pressure measurements were performed using high-fidelity catheters. Gradients after pressure recovery were predicted from Doppler using a validated equation. Doppler overestimated catheter gradients in both the mechanical and Biocor. Mean Doppler catheter differences for the mechanical/Biocor were for mean gradients of 4 +/- 3 (SD p = 0.002)/6 +/- 4 mm Hg (p = 0.002). There was a strong relation between catheter and Doppler gradients (r = 0.85 to 0.92). Doppler catheter discrepancy as a percentage of the Doppler mean gradient for the mechanical was median 41% (range -30% to 76%) and for the Biocor was median 35% (range -7% to 75%). The catheter-Doppler discrepancy was not significant using the predicted net gradient from Doppler. In conclusion, this was the first in vivo investigation of prosthetic valves using simultaneous Doppler and high-fidelity catheters. Doppler overestimated catheter gradients in both mechanical and stented biologic valves. However, the discrepancy can be predicted considering pressure recovery in the aorta.
