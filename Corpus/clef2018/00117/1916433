Doppler echocardiography in the evaluation of prosthetic valve function. The limitations of invasive and noninvasive procedures, including M-mode and 2-D echocardiography, in the follow-up of patients with prosthetic heart valve replacement, are numerous and well known. Doppler echocardiography helps the functional evaluation of prosthetic valves by reliable detection of valvular regurgitation through a malfunctioning prosthetic valve or due to paravalvular leaks. On the other hand, serial determinations of the values of pressure drops or effective valve orifice areas, calculated from the half-time pressure, enables the diagnosis of prosthetic valve obstruction or dehiscence. The results in the assessment of prosthetic valve function by Doppler echocardiography in a group of operated patients, are reported. Signs of prosthetic valve malfunction were not present in 6 patients with mitral valve prostheses and two patients with two-valve-prostheses (mitral and aortic) in the group ob 13 evaluated patients. In two patients with Bj√∂rk mitral valves mitral regurgitation was found. It was due to valvular leakage in one patient and to paravalvular leakages in the other. In both patients with aortic prosthetic dysfunction a paravalvular leak was diagnosed. There was an invasive proof of prosthetic regurgitation in the same four patients. The only patient with biologic mitral valve prosthesis presented a significant flow obstruction.
