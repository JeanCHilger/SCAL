Contrast enhanced ultrasonography versus MR angiography in aortocaval fistula: case report. Aortocaval fistula (ACF) is a rare, life threatening complication of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Time to diagnosis is crucial as preoperative diagnosis and early surgical intervention significantly improve the outcome. The clinical spectrum being varied, the challenge of prompt and reliable diagnosis rests on emergency radiology. While the gold standard for detecting ACF today is CT angiography (CTA), frequently complicating renal insufficiency discourages the use of iodinated contrast making MR angiography (MRA) a useful alternative. Contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) provides a promising new diagnostic option allowing rapid, non invasive and bedside diagnosis, especially in hemodynamically unstable patients. We present a case of prompt diagnosis of ACF by CEUS in comparison to modern MRA, thus establishing the new potential role of CEUS.
