Safer aortic crossclamping during short-term moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest for cardiac surgery in patients with a bad ascending aorta. Cardiac surgery in patients with severely atherosclerotic or porcelain ascending aorta is technically challenging, with markedly increased risk of atheroembolism. We describe a technique of meticulous crossclamping of a difficult aorta during short-term moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest.From 1997 to 2007, we found 40 patients (mean age, 70 +/- 8 years), including 14 patients undergoing hemodialysis, whose preoperative computed tomographic and intraoperative epiaortic ultrasonographic scans revealed eggshell calcification (n = 15) or protruding atheromas (n = 25) of the ascending aorta. They underwent cardiac surgery (aortic, 31 patients mitral, 3 patientsBy using this technique, no patients died during the hospital stay. Stroke occurred in 1 (2.5%) patient, and transient agitation occurred in 1 patient. Re-exploration for bleeding was required in 1 patient, and wound infection occurred in 2 patients. During follow-up, with a median time of 5.2 years, the overall survival rates were 100%, 90%, and 76% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Three patients required reoperations during the follow-up period because of pseudoaneurysm in 2 patients and prosthetic valve infection in 1 patient.Short-term moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest is quite useful for safe aortic crossclamping after internal inspection or debridement in high-risk patients with a severely atherosclerotic aorta.
