Endovascular treatment of iliac aneurysm: Concurrent comparison of side branch endograft versus hypogastric exclusion. To analyze early and mid-term outcome of endovascular treatment in patients with iliac aneurysms, comparing the results of hypogastric revascularization by branch endografting with those of hypogastric occlusion.Consecutive patients with iliac aneurysms receiving side branch endograft (Group I) were compared with those receiving endograft with hypogastric exclusion (Group II) during the interval from January 2000 to May 2008. Procedural details and outcomes were prospectively collected and were analyzed at one year to avoid mismatch in follow-up length.A total of 74 patients (mean age, 75.8 years, 95% males) were treated: 32 in Group I and 42 in Group II. No differences in baseline risk factors and aneurysm diameter (40.2 +/- 7.9 mm in Group I vs. 38.4 +/- 10.8 in Group II) were found. Concurrent treatment of aortic aneurysm was performed in 25/32 (78%) of Group I and 36/42 (86%) of Group II. Fluoro time was 48 minutes (interquartile range [IQR] 31-57) in Group I vs. 31 minutes (IQR 23-38) in Group II (P = .04). The amount of contrast was similar in both Groups: 184 ml (IQR 155-210) in Group I vs. 183 ml (IQR 155-200) in Group II. No intestinal ischemia or deaths occurred. There were no significant differences in failures of hypogastric side branch deployment (2/32) compared with hypogastric coiling (3/42). Limb occlusions all occurring in the external iliac artery side were 2/32 in Group I vs. 3/42 in Group II. Reintervention rates were similar (5/32 vs. 4/42) at one year. Shrinkage of 5 mm or more was detected in 7/23 (30%) of Group I and in 13/37 (34%) of Group II. Iliac endoleak was present in eight patients (19%) in Group II and in one patient in Group I (4%) (P = .1). Similarly, buttock claudication or impotence were more frequent after hypogastric exclusion, recorded in eight patients in Group II and in one patient in Group I (P = .1).Endovascular treatment of iliac aneurysm with hypogastric revascularization through side branched endografts is feasible and safe in the mid-term. When compared with hypogastric embolization, this option leads to similar technical success and reintervention rates. Endoleak and buttock claudication occur frequently in patients with iliac aneurysm treated with hypogastric exclusion, while are uncommon in those with hypogastric revascularization. Side branch endografting for iliac aneurysm may be considered a primary choice in younger, active patients with suitable anatomy, but larger studies and longer postoperative observation periods are needed.
