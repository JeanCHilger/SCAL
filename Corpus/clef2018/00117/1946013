Aneurysm of the right ventricular outflow tract: a complication of aorta-main pulmonary (central) shunt. The ascending aorta-main pulmonary artery (central) polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) Gore-Tex shunt was introduced in 1975 by Gazzaniga and coworker. It is a widely used palliative procedure. We present a case study with an unusual late complication. An aneurysm was discovered at autopsy in a patient who was diagnosed at birth with hypoplastic right ventricle, pulmonary valve atresia, small main and branched pulmonary arteries. At 4 days of age, the patient underwent an aorta to main pulmonary artery (PTFE) Gore-Tex shunt. Subsequent echocardiogram showed dilatation of the right ventricular outflow tract. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) aneurysm following central aortopulmonary shunt.
