Aorto-caval fistula due to rupture of abdominal aorto-iliac aneurysm--a case report of successful repair. A 62-year-old man who had complained of swelling of bilateral lower extremities, exertional dyspnea and jaundice for 3 months was referred to our hospital with a diagnosis of large abdominal aneurysm and congestive heart failure. His aortography and Doppler echocardiography revealed that he had the aorto-caval fistula due to rupture of abdominal aorto-iliac aneurysm. He underwent a reconstruction of abdominal aorta with woven Dacron bifurcation graft together with a closure of fistula with 3 mattress sutures. The postoperative course was uneventful and he is free from any symptoms. Problems of diagnosis, operative management and results are discussed, reviewing the previously reported cases in Japan.
