Virtual angioscopy assessment for acute type B aortic dissection endovascular repair. Virtual angioscopy 3D reconstruction (VA) based on Multidetector computed tomography (m-CT) can be an important tool in endovascular aortic repair assessment. Here, we present a case of an acute type B aortic dissection, evaluated with preoperative virtual angioscopy 3D reconstruction (VA).A 60 years-old-man presented with type B acute aortic dissection. Due to renal malperfusion and uncontrolled hypertension TEVAR and renal stenting was performed based on m-CT and VA images.Aortic dissection endovascular repair requires an accurate evaluation based on M-CT or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). VA is a CT-based 3D reconstruction that provides a sort of information comparable to intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) that can be very helpful when it is not available and has many other potential applications in vascular surgery.
