Evaluation of a rabbit model of abdominal aorta atherosclerosis. To explore the methods for non-invasive evaluation of a rabbit model of aorta atherosclerosis model.Sixteen male New Zealand rabbits (n=16) were randomized into the experimental group and control group and fed with high-cholesterol diet and normal diet after balloon injury in the abdominal aorta, respectively. Eight weeks later, pathological examination, angiography and surface ultrasonography were carried out to evaluate the plaques in the aorta.After feeding with high-cholesterol diet for 8 weeks, the weight, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) were significantly increased in the rabbits (P<0.001), and atherosclerosis in the abdominal aorta was directly observed using angiography and surface ultrasonography. The rate of vasoconstriction showed significant difference between the experimental group and control group (t=5.921, P=0.000). In the experimental rabbits, the vasoconstriction increased obviously after drug stimulation with high lumen eccentricity index. A significant positive correlation was noted between the lumen eccentricity index and the rate of vasoconstriction (r=0.983, P=0.000).A rabbit model of abdominal aorta atherosclerosis can be established rapidly by balloon injury and high-cholesterol diet. The aortic wall thickness, lumen diameter and lumen eccentricity index determined by surface ultrasonography can be used to evaluate the validity of the model establishment and the nature of the plaque.
