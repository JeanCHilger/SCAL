Evaluation of the diagnostic and prognostic value of plasma D-dimer for abdominal aortic aneurysm. A number of biomarkers have been associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), but there has been no assessment of how such markers along with clinical risk factors can be used to stratify the risk of AAA presence and its progression. The aims of this study were to assess the diagnostic, prognostic, and risk stratification potential of plasma D-dimer for AAA presence and growth.We included 1260 subjects (337 with AAA) recruited from a population screening study and 132 (41 with AAA) from a referral clinic. A total of 299 of the population group were followed by repeat ultrasound imaging for a median of 5.5 years to monitor AAA growth. The diagnostic and prognostic potential of plasma D-dimer was assessed by multivariate regression (adjusting for other AAA risk factors), receiver operator characteristic, and classification and regression tree (CART) analyses. In both groups, the dominant risk factor for AAA was D-dimer thus in the population group, cut-off values of > 400 and > 900 ng/mL had adjusted odds ratios of 12.1 (95% CI 7.1-20.5) and 24.7 (95% CI 13.7-44.6), respectively. In both groups, CART analyses confirmed the dominating role of plasma D-dimer in defining extreme risk-groups with AAA prevalence as disparate as 3 and 82%. Average yearly AAA growth was positively and significantly associated with D-dimer which was able to predict growth as disparate as 0.4 and 2.5 mm/year.This study suggests that plasma D-dimer can play a role in the diagnosis and prognosis of AAA.
