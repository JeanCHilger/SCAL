Intraoperative angiography after coronary bypass grafting in a patient presenting with a single coronary artery: a case report. Among coronary artery anomalies, single coronary artery is one of the rarest anomalies. Pulmonary origins of the coronary arteries, coronary artery fistulae, and anomalous aortic origins of the coronary arteries are the most common anomalies requiring surgical intervention. In this case, we describe the performance of bypass grafting after unsuccessful attempts at percutaneous coronary intervention in a 72-year old male patient with single coronary artery arising from the right sinus of Valsalva and with associated diffuse coronary atherosclerosis. Intraoperative angiography was performed to evaluate the revascularization of this anomalous coronary system. The patient remains symptom free 6 months after the operation.
