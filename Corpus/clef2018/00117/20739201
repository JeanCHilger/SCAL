A retrospective study of intravascular ultrasound use in patients undergoing endovascular aneurysm repair: its usefulness and a description of the procedure. To verify the usefulness and limitation of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) in endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).A total of 112 consecutive patients, who underwent EVAR to treat abdominal aortic aneurysms, were examined retrospectively. Of these, 33 patients were assigned to the IVUS group because of renal failure, a suspected allergy to contrast agents or anatomical difficulties the remaining 79 patients were assigned to the non-IVUS group.Patients in the IVUS group required fewer intra-arterial contrast agents (IACAs) than those in the non-IVUS group (67±34ml vs. 123±50ml p<0.01). Blood loss and operation time were comparable between the two groups. No patients died within 30 days of the operation. Three major renal complications occurred in the non-IVUS group. Renal deterioration evaluated by chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage was found to a greater extent in the non-IVUS group.IVUS is a powerful auxiliary method in EVAR for reducing the required volume of contrast agents. The combination of IVUS and IACA usage showed good overall performance thus, we propose the routine use of IVUS in EVAR procedures.
