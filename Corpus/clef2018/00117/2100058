Echocardiography by the transesophageal route. Technique and the main clinical indications. Transoesophageal Doppler-echocardiography is a new heart imaging technique avoiding many of the problems which sometimes limit standard transthoracic exploration. The transducer, mounted on a fibroscope sheath, is introduced into the oesophagus and therefore lies in the immediate vicinity of the atrial complex, the mitral valve, the aortic valve and the different segments of the thoracic aorta. The examination can be carried out on ambulatory patients in the echocardiography laboratory. The main clinical indications of this technique are: studies of prosthetic valves (notably the mitral valve) detection of vegetations or annular abscesses in infective endocarditis
