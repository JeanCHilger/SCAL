Early development of leaks in the CoreValve percutaneous aortic valve prosthesis: echocardiographic assessment. The study investigated echocardiographic findings after 1 month in 22 patients who received a CoreValve prostheses to treat aortic valve stenosis. Particular attention was paid to the evaluation of valvular leaks and the left ventricular wall thickness. Echocardiograms were obtained prior to implantation, at discharge and 1 month later. The patients' mean age was 77 ± 4 years. At discharge, 16 patients (76%) had aortic regurgitation: 8 grade I and 8 grade II. At 1 month, only 13 (62%) presented with the condition: 10 grade I and 3 grade II, with 8 patients (38%) demonstrating a reduction of at least one grade (P < .005). The septal thickness decreased (from 14.2 ± 2 mm at baseline to 11 ± 2.4 mm at 1 month P < .001), as did the posterior wall thickness (from 10.9 ± 2.4 mm at baseline to 8.3 ± 1.2 mm at 1 month
