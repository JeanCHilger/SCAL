Endovascular solutions to arterial injury due to posterior spine surgery. Iatrogenic arterial injury is an uncommon but recognized complication of posterior spinal surgery. The spectrum of injuries includes vessel perforation leading to hemorrhage, delayed pseudoaneurysm formation, and threatened perforation by screw impingement on arterial vessels. Repair of these injuries traditionally involved open direct vessel repair or graft placement, which can be associated with significant morbidity. We identified five patients with iatrogenic arterial injury during or after posterior spinal surgery between July 2004 and August 2009 and describe their endovascular treatment. Intraoperative arterial bleeding was encountered in two patients during posterior spinal surgery. The posterior wounds were packed, temporarily closed, and the patient was placed supine. In both patients, angiography demonstrated arterial injury necessitating repair. Covered stent grafts were deployed through femoral cutdowns to exclude the areas of injury. In three additional patients, postoperative computed tomography imaging demonstrated pedicle screws abutting/penetrating the thoracic or abdominal aorta. Angiography or intravascular ultrasound imaging, or both, confirmed indention/perforation of the aorta by the screw. Aortic stent graft cuffs were deployed through femoral cutdowns to cover the area of aortic contact before hardware removal. All five patients did well and were discharged home in good condition. Endovascular repair of arterial injuries occurring during posterior spinal procedures is feasible and can offer a safe and less invasive alternative to open repair.
