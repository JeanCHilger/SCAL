Echodoppler evaluation of the normally functioning Saint-Jude's aortic valve prosthesis. The aims of this study were: to define Doppler echocardiographic criteria of normality of aortic St Jude Medical (SJM) valve prostheses with respect to their size and to verify the validity of the continuity equation in the determination of prosthetic valve functional surface area. Forty patients with apparently normally functioning SJM prostheses without other cardiac disease were investigated at least one month after surgery. The group consisted in 1 n. 19, 6 n. 21, 9 n. 23, 12 n. 25 and 12 n. 27 SJM prostheses. The following parameters were measured: the maximum transprosthetic velocity, maximum and mean transprosthetic pressure gradients, permeability index and the Doppler surface area calculated by the continuity equation using the method proposed by Skjaerpe. The global results were as follows: maximum velocity = 2.5 +/- 0.4 m/s (1.8-3.7 m/s) maximum gradient = 26.9 +/- 9.8 mmHg (14-53 mmHg)
