Imaging for trans-catheter pulmonary stent-valve implantation without angiography: role of intravascular ultrasound. Patients with stenosed biologic pulmonary conduits require redo cardiac surgery to prevent severe right ventricular dysfunction. Following the latest trends, the trans-catheter pulmonary stent-valve implantation represents a new fascinating alternative carrying a lower operative risk, compared with the standard open-heart re-intervention. Traditionally, the pulmonary stent valve is positioned off pump, under fluoroscopic control, and requires angiographies. However, alternative tools not requiring contrast injections for the intra-operative cardiac imaging have to be also considered strongly. The usefulness of intravascular ultrasound for the positioning of aortic endoprosthesis has already been proven in previous reports and, following the same principle, we have started to routinely implant balloon-expandable stent valves (Edwards Sapienâ„¢ THV) in stenosed pulmonary valve conduits using intravascular ultrasound for the stent-valve positioning without angiography. We describe the intra-operative intravascular imaging technique with technical details.
