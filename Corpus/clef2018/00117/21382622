Serum secreted phospholipase A2 is associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm presence but not progression. Secretory phospholipase A(2) (sPLA(2)) has been implicated in rodent models of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The aim of this study was to assess whether serum sPLA(2) activity was associated with AAA presence and progression.Serum sPLA(2) activity was measured using a fluorometric assay in 1002 men of whom 310 had an AAA. 272 of the men had repeat ultrasound surveillance of their AAA for a median of 5.5 years. The association of sPLA(2) activity with AAA was assessed using multiple regression analysis to adjust for other risk factors.Median serum sPLA(2) activity was 21.67 in men with AAA and 18.32 U/ml in men without AAA, p<0.001. Men with sPLA(2) activity â‰¥ median (19.20 U/ml) had a 1.40-fold (95% CI 1.04-1.87, p=0.027) increased prevalence of AAA independent of other risk factors. Serum sPLA(2) activity was not associated with AAA growth.Serum sPLA(2) activity is elevated in men with small AAAs but is not associated with AAA progression.
