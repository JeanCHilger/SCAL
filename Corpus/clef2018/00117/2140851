Evaluation of aortocoronary bypass operation using a He-Ne laser flowmeter--comparison between internal mammary artery grafts and saphenous vein grafts. It was very difficult to measure myocardial blood flow in clinical cases. Recently, a He-Ne laser doppler flowmeter was developed, and we made it possible to measure the pre-and post-operative myocardial blood flow in cases of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). We applied a laser flowmeter to 30 cases of bypass grafting to the left anterior descending coronary artery (18 cases with IMAG and 12 cases with SVG). The preoperative myocardial blood flow at the right ventricular anterior wall was 77 +/- 15 ml/min/100 gr, and the postoperative flow at the same point was 81 +/- 12 ml/min/100 gr. There was no significant change between the pre-operative value and the postoperative one. Myocardial blood flow at the left ventricular anterior wall in SVG group significantly increased from the preoperative value of 58 +/- 11 ml/min/100 gr to the postoperative value of 86 +/- 9 ml/min/100 gr (p less than 0.001). In IMAG group, myocardial blood flow at the left ventricular anterior wall similarly increased from 73 +/- 14 ml/min/100 gr to 83 +/- 15 ml/min/100 gr (p less than 0.01). The postoperative value of IMAG group was almost equal to the value of SVG group. The increased rate of myocardial blood flow at the left ventricular anterior wall was 52 +/- 32% in SVG group and 18 +/- 12% in IMAG group. These rates were obviously distinguished from the increased rate at the right ventricular anterior wall.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
