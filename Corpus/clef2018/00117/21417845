Endovascular treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms: indications and results. Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is an attractive alternative to open surgical approach in treating abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). In Nuerenberg in our 14-year experience of 1502 cases (ending December 2007) we used 13 different endografts. The median follow-up was 41 months (1.0-98) and the AAA had a mean diameter of 52.4 mm. Five-hundred and nineteen cases were done using Powerlink grafts. The 30 day mortality was 1.7%. The total reintervention rate was 5.3%, while no distal migration, conversion or post EVAR rupture occurred. At the Army's Center for Cardiovascular Diseases, Bucharest, between July 2008 and December 2009, 15 patients underwent EVAR for AAA. We used the following types of endografts: one Anaconda, three Medtronic Talent, seven Endologix Powerlink and four EVITA Jotec. The mean hospitalization time was three days. Follow-up was done by CT-scan at one, three, six, and 12 months. No endoleaks or infection were seen in the short and medium term follow-up. EVAR is an appropriate treatment for selected patients, especially those at high risk for open surgical repair. The future of EVAR as the potential gold standard for aortic aneurysm therapy rests upon the vision and creativity of both surgeons and technology innovators to realize the potential of endovascular interventions.
