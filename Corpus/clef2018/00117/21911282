Spontaneous retroperitoneal hematoma: etiology, characteristics, management, and outcome. Spontaneous retroperitoneal hematoma (SRH) can be fatal, requiring immediate recognition and intervention. Current literature is limited, providing little direction in patient care.To describe clinical characteristics of patients with SRH during an 8-year period.Observational cohort study of all consecutive patients 18 years and older with SRH from January 2000 to December 2007. SRH was defined as unrelated to invasive procedures, surgery, trauma, or abdominal aortic aneurysm.Of 346 patients screened, 89 were eligible. Median age was 72 years 56.2% were male. Overall, 66.3% were anticoagulated: 41.6% on warfarin, 30.3% heparin, and 11.2% low-molecular-weight heparinSRH is uncommon but potentially lethal, with a non-specific presentation that can lead to misdiagnosis. One-third of the cohort was not taking anticoagulants. CT was effective at identification. Most patients received aggressive management with transfusion or IR procedures.
