Blood flow velocity and pulsatile diameter changes in the fetal descending aorta: a longitudinal study. Blood flow velocity and pulsatile diameter changes in the fetal descending aorta were measured subsequently with pulsed Doppler ultrasonography and phase-locked echo-tracking technique, respectively. Blood flow velocity and pulse-wave curves with equal beat-to-beat intervals were synchronized by external fetal electrocardiogram. The systolic increase in blood flow velocity and in vessel diameter started simultaneously. The velocity peak preceded the diameter peak by a significant margin (p in the range 0.0001 to 0.0014). The time interval was more pronounced in the thoracic than in the abdominal part of the aorta and was slightly smaller near term. The effective diameter, calculated from the synchronized integrals of the blood flow velocity and the diameter curves, was significantly greater (p in the range 0.0001 to 0.0016) than the mean diameter. The difference tended to decrease with advancing gestational age and was more pronounced in the thoracic than in the abdominal aorta. The maximum error incurred by the use of nonsimultaneous measurements of blood flow velocity and vessel diameter when calculating volume blood flow was found to be less than 8% and thus probably of little practical importance.
