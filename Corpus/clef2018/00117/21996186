Is severe atherosclerosis in the aortoiliac region a contraindication for kidney transplantation? Atherosclerosis is common in end-stage renal disease patients on dialysis. However, it has previously been considered to be a relative contraindication to kidney transplantation. Currently, patients with extended indications are accepted onto the waiting list, including those with severe atherosclerosis. These patients require vascular procedures before or during kidney transplantation. The aim of this study was to present our experience with vascular reconstruction before kidney transplantation.Twelve atherosclerotic, uremic patients referred to be candidates for kidney transplantation were refused because of occlusive lesions of the iliac arteries or the distal aorta. The 10 males and 2 females had an age range of 45 to 68 years. Preoperative assessments consisted of a Doppler ultrasound and an angio computed tomography scan. The reconstructions were performed with aorto-biliac, aorto-bifemoral, or ilio-femoral dacron grafts in 7, 4, and 1 patient, respectively, under general anesthesia.There were no major postoperative complications the patients were discharged and placed on a special waiting list. Eight patients received kidney allografts, including one living-related transplantation. All procedures were performed with arterial anastomosis of the transplanted kidney to the side of the prosthesis. No patient developed signs of arterial graft infection. In the postoperative period, there were no arterial or transplanted kidney-related complications, except for delayed graft function in four cases. The remaining four patients are still on the waiting list.In end-stage renal disease patients with severe atherosclerosis in the aortoiliac region, vascular reconstruction allows kidney transplantation.
