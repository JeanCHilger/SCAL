Color flow Doppler in the evaluation of aortic aneurysms. Fifteen patients with aortic aneurysms have been evaluated with Doppler color flow imaging. Two distinct flow patterns are noted: a smooth laminar pattern and a turbulent circuitous pattern. It is postulated that those patients with a turbulent pattern may be at greater risk for aneurysm enlargement and rupture.
