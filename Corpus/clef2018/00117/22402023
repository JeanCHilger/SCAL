Simulation model for assessing quality of ultrasound strain estimation in abdominal aortic aneurysm. The purpose of this study was to develop a simulation model for evaluating methods for ultrasound strain estimation in abdominal aortic aneurysms. Wall geometry was obtained from a real ultrasound image and wall motion was simulated applying realistic blood pressures to a nonlinear viscoelastic wall model. The ultrasound simulation included speckle, absorption and angle dependent reflection. Gaussian white noise was added to simulate various noise levels. Despite not fully replicating real ultrasound images, the model simulated realistic circumferential variations in intensity and realistic speckle patterns and has potential for initial evaluation of strain estimation methods.
