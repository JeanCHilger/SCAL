Duplex evaluation following femoropopliteal angioplasty and stenting: criteria and utility of surveillance. Surveillance following lower extremity bypass, carotid endarterectomy, and endovascular aortic aneurysm repair has become the standard of care at most institutions. Conversely, surveillance following lower extremity endovascular interventions is performed somewhat sporadically in part because the duplex criteria for recurrent stenoses have been ill defined. It appears that duplex surveillance after peripheral endovascular interventions, as with conventional bypass, is beneficial in identifying recurrent lesions which may preclude failure and occlusion. In-stent stenosis following superficial femoral artery angioplasty and stenting can be predicted by both peak systolic velocity and velocity ratio data as measured by duplex ultrasound. Duplex criteria have been defined to determine both ≥50% in-stent stenosis and ≥80% in-stent stenosis. Although not yet well studied, it appears that applying these criteria during routine surveillance may assist in preventing failure of endovascular interventions.
