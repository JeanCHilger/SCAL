First experience with AndraStent XL implantation in children and adolescents with congenital heart diseases. To present our experience with a new type of extra-large (dilatable up to 25 mm), balloon-expandable, nonpremounted, cobalt-chromium peripheral stent with semiopen designed cells: AndraStent.Between December 2008 and August 2011, 21 AndraStents in 21 patients were implanted into vessel stenoses of varied localizations. AndraStents XL of 21, 30, and 39 mm in length were used. The median age and weight of patients at stent implantation were 11.6 years (range 2.1-19.1 years) and 36 kg (range 11-82 kg), respectively. The stent was implanted into the left pulmonary artery stenosis (n = 12), into the aortic isthmus (n = 7), into a stenosed aortopulmonary collateral artery (n = 1) and into a stenosed systemic venous tunnel postSenning operation (n = 1).All the implantations were successfully performed there was one major vessel access complication necessitating vascular surgery. The diameter of the vessel stenosis increased significantly (P < 0.05) from a median of 5.7-11 mm. The stent foreshortening was only mild.Our initial results show that AndraStents are implantable and efficacious in different vascular stenoses and present a valuable alternative to the available large stents. With the application of a modified front-loading technique, they can also be implanted in smaller children.
