Hepatic artery aneurysm treatment with heparin-bonded covered stent: a case report. The hepatic artery is the second most common site for aneurysms formation within the splanchnic circulation. Most hepatic artery aneurysms (HAA) are diagnosed incidentally by a computed tomography(CT) scan or a Doppler ultrasonography. We present the case of a HAA diagnosed preoperatively in a 82-year old man, who was treated with an endovascular procedure. An abdominal ultrasonography revealed by chance the presence of a HAA. The abdominal CT scan confirmed an aneurysm of the common hepatic artery, specifically at the origin of the gastroduodenal artery. The gastroduodenal artery was embolized using coils then a heparin-bonded covered stent was deployed into the common hepatic artery to exclude the aneurysm. Final arteriogram documented the regular patency of the stent and the complete exclusion of the aneurysm. No complication occurred and the patient was discharged on the second postoperative day. Six months later, a follow-up with a Duplex scan confirmed the regular patency of the stent, and the patient was in good clinical conditions.
