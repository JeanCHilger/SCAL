Diagnosis of tetralogy of Fallot and its variants in the late first and early second trimester: details of initial assessment and comparison with later fetal diagnosis. We sought to evaluate the completeness of echocardiographic diagnosis of fetal tetralogy of Fallot (fTOF) at 12-17 weeks gestation, and compare assessment and clinical outcomes to diagnoses made at >17 weeks gestation.We identified all fTOF diagnoses made in our experience from 2003 to 2008. Referral indication, anatomic detail by echocardiography and pregnancy outcomes were compared between fetuses diagnosed at ≤ 17 weeks (Group I) and >17 weeks gestation (Group II). A 10-point scoring tool was applied retrospectively to the echocardiograms at initial diagnosis (1 point each was ascribed to visualization of right ventricular outflow obstruction, pulmonary valve, pulmonary arteries including dimensions, pulmonary arterial flow, systemic and pulmonary venous anatomy, atrioventricular valves, ductus arteriosus, ductus flow, aortic arch morphology, sidedness and flow).There were 10 pregnancies in Group I (12-17 weeks) and 25 in Group II (mean gestation at diagnosis 23.5 ± 5.7). The most common reason for referral was extracardiac pathology in Group I (80%) and suspected fetal heart disease on obstetric ultrasound in Group II (64%). Transabdominal imaging was adequate in about half of Group I studies. Mean anatomic diagnosis score in Group I was 6.1(range 2.5-9) and Group II was 8.4 (range 6.5-10). Elective pregnancy termination occurred in 80% in Group I and 33% in Group II.fTOF can be diagnosed in first and early second trimesters with detailed anatomic assessment possible in most. Referral indication and pregnancy outcome differ considerably between early and later prenatal diagnosis of fTOF.
