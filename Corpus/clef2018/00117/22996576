Pulsatile tumor on the left side of the thorax after heart surgery. In a 67-year-old woman a large haematoma developed on the left side of the chest after two sternotomies because of an aortic valve and aorta ascendens replacement for aortic type A dissection. After a few weeks, a pulsating mass remained over the 6th left parasternal intercostal space. A consultant general surgeon punctured the lesion and aspirated bright red blood. The patient was transferred for further diagnostic procedures to the cardiology department.Ultrasound examination of the pulsating mass showed a 35 mm echo-free cavity with turbulent flow in the color Doppler. To clarify the inflow into this perfused cavity magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with angiography of the thorax vessels was performed. The cavity was found to be a perfused pseudoaneurysm originating from the native left mammary artery. The aneurysm had a 6 mm long neck and a diameter of 35 mm. An interventional closure was planned.With access via the right groin a 6 French LIMA guiding catheter was inserted into the origin of the left internal mammary artery. With a 0.014 inch Balance Middleweight coronary guide wire it was possible to engage the pseudoaneurysm. Over the wire, a tracker 18 infusion catheter was pushed down and placed in the pseudoaneurysm. The closure was performed by insertion of a 0.018 inch 3 cm/4 mm Hilal Microcoil into the aneurysm neck. The mammary artery was anatomically and functionally unaffected. After the deposit of a coil, the inflow was stopped. An ultrasound showed a blood coagulation in the pseudoaneurysm, which decreased in size over time.After sternotomy a pseudoaneurysm of the left internal mammary artery had developed. As a noninvasive imaging modalitiy the magnetic resonance angiography showed well the exact flow into the aneurysm and allowed the planning of the intervention. The closure was achieved with a microcoil with preservation of the native internal mammary artery.
