Endovascular treatment for extensive aortoiliac artery reconstruction: a single-center experience based on 1712 interventions. To determine the clinical and technical outcomes following endovascular therapy for aortoiliac occlusive disease, including complex reconstruction of the aortic bifurcation.A retrospective database search identified 1184 consecutive patients (864 men mean age 64±10 years) who underwent 1712 procedures to treat target lesions in the distal aorta and iliac arteries from September 1996 to December 2006. The intended strategy was to open only one femoral access site primarily, so a second puncture was needed only for the kissing balloon technique at the aortic bifurcation. The primary endpoint was a 1-year duplex-based primary patencyMost of the interventions were done in the iliac arteries (n=1337) 292 cases involved the aortic bifurcation, and 83 cases were in the distal aorta/aortic bifurcation. The mean follow-up was 3.24 years (range 0-12.7). In the entire study cohort, the 12- and 24-month restenosis, TLR, and primary/secondary patency rates did not differ among TASC II A-D subgroups. The symptom-driven TLR in the entire cohort was 8% and 9% at the 12- and 24-month follow-up, leading to secondary patency rates of 96% and 91% in the entire cohort. Outcomes for complex interventions in the distal aorta or aortic bifurcation did not differ significantly compared to the total cohort. The overall survival without restenosis, amputation, or surgery in TASC II subgroups A+B was higher (69.6%±1.5%) compared to TASC II C+D lesions (62.8%±1.9%, p=0.001).The indication for percutaneous intervention in aortoiliac occlusive disease can be extended to complex TASC C and D lesions in experienced endovascular centers, even if complex reconstruction of the distal aorta or the aortic bifurcation is indicated.
