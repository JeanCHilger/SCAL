Incidence and treatment results of Endurant endograft occlusion. The Endurant endograft (Medtronic Inc, Minneapolis, Minn) is a new-generation device specifically developed to perform well in complex abdominal aortic aneurysm anatomy. Previous reports on the 1- and 2-year results of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) with the Endurant endograft showed excellent outcome, including prevention of migration and type I endoleaks, but occurrence and outcome of post-EVAR occlusion have not been determined in a large multicenter patient cohort with midterm follow-up, which is the objective of this study.Data of consecutive patients treated with the Endurant from December 2007 to April 2012 in three Dutch tertiary vascular referral hospitals were prospectively gathered and retrospectively analyzed. Follow-up consisted of regular office visits, computed tomography angiography at 1 and 12 months after EVAR, and subsequently, duplex ultrasound imaging or computed tomography angiography at regular intervals. Patients with ruptured aneurysms or with earlier abdominal aortic surgery were excluded. The incidence and clinical outcome of endograft occlusions were analyzed. An expert review board assessed all cases in the search for possible causes of occlusion.Included were 496 patients (87.7% male), who were a median age of 74 years (range, 68-78 years). Median follow-up was 1.7 years (range, 0-4.6 years). Twenty graft occlusions (4.0%) occurred during follow-up. Median time between primary EVAR and detection of the occlusion was 1 month, with 55% occurring ≤ 60 postoperative days and 90% ≤ 1 year. No association was found between occlusion and sex (P = .28), age (P = .96), or use of an aortouniiliac device (P = .66). Technical error was the considered cause of the occlusion in 12 patients (60%). The estimated freedom from occlusion was 98.4% at 30 days, 95.7% at 1 year, and 95.3% at 3 years. Presenting symptoms of occlusion were acute limb ischemia in 50%. Treatment was surgical (75%) or percutaneous (25%). Successful revascularization was achieved in 17 of 20 patients, but reocclusions occurred in five, resulting in a transfemoral amputation in one patient. Occlusion-related mortality was 0.6% (3 of 496).At a median follow-up of 1.7 years, Endurant endograft occlusion occurred in 4.0% of 496 patients. Most occlusions occurred ≤ 2 months after EVAR, and rarely after 1 year. A technical justification for occlusion could be found for 60% of patients. A more liberal intraoperative and early postoperative (re)intervention strategy may reduce the occlusion rates and improve outcome.
