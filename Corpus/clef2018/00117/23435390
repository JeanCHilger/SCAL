Abdominal aortic aneurysm and new WHO criteria for screening. Does screening of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) fulfil the recently revised the World Health Organization WHO criteria for screening? Contemporary data from the literature are used to analyze whether the ten recent WHO criteria can be used to motivate AAA screening. Although the prevalence of AAA seems to decrease, at least screening of 65-year old males saves lives and is cost-effective. Ultrasonographic screening for AAA in risk populations fulfils the new WHO criteria for screening.
