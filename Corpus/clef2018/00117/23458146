Spontaneous rectus sheath hematoma diagnosed by point-of-care ultrasonography. Spontaneous rectus sheath hematoma is an uncommon condition that can mimic other conditions associated with an acute abdomen. We report the case of a patient with a spontaneous rectus sheath hematoma due to a ruptured inferior epigastric artery pseudoaneurysm who presented with hypotension and severe abdominal pain and was diagnosed using emergency department point-of-care ultrasonography. Point-of-care ultrasonography has been increasingly used in the evaluation of emergency department patients with acute abdomen and hypotension to expedite the diagnosis and management of aortic aneurysm and intraperitoneal bleeding. Resuscitation and urgent surgical and interventional radiology consultations resulted in the successful embolization of a branch of the inferior epigastric artery and a good outcome.
