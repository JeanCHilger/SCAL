Predictor factors for renal outcome in renal artery stenosis. Atherosclerotic ischemic renal disease is a frequent cause of end-stage renal failure. Correction of renal artery stenosis (RAS) may fail to stabilize or improve renal function.Carotid and aortic Intima media thickness (IMT), resistance renal resistance index (RI), arterial blood pressure (BP), serum creatinine (SCr), creatinine clearance (CrCl), proteinuria and uricemia were considered as possible predictive factors and measured before renal-artery stenosis correction and during 12 months follow-up.we performed an observational study on a total of 55 patients to find predictive factors of the outcome of renal function after renal percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting (RPTAs).We found that uricemia, proteinuria and IR were higher at baseline in patients who worsened renal function after revascularization.The identification of predictive factors (uricemia proteinuria and RI) of chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression in patients with RAS undergone revascularization could be useful to predict renal long term outcome and to select patients that really could benefit of this.
