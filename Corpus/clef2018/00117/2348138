Post-operative evaluation of a 17 mm diameter Björk-Shiley Monostrut prosthesis for aortic valve replacement--pressure gradient and effective valve area. A 17 mm diameter Björk-Shiley Monostrut prosthesis was implanted in a 64-year-old female for aortic valve replacement in a semi-emergency. This valve was one of the smallest valves which were available in Japan. The patient was admitted because of severe hemolytic anemia and heart failure. Echocardiography showed regurgitation and calcification of Ionescu-Shiley tissue valve which was implanted 5 years ago. The patient's body surface area was 1.2 m2. Because of narrow aortic annulus, we could barely implant a 17 mm diameter Björk-Shiley Monostrut prosthesis. The valve function was examined by Brockenbrough method. During catheterization, the heart rate was 85 b/min and cardiac index was 3.00 l/min/m2. In these hemodynamic conditions, simultaneous measurements of aortic and left ventricular pressures revealed only 9 mmHg mean systolic pressure gradient. Similarly, 20 mmHg of pressure gradient across the implanted valve was obtained by Gorlin's formula. We could calculate that the effective orifice area of a 17 mm diameter Björk-Shiley Monostrut prosthesis was 1.0 cm2. Postoperative echocardiography demonstrated 42 mmHg systolic pressure gradient across this prosthesis by Doppler techniques, and left ventricular wall thickness was not decreased. To best our knowledges, this was the first case in which post-operative evaluation such a small prosthesis was measured.
