Late renal artery occlusion following endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm: a possible complication of mural thrombus formation within aortic endografts. Mural thrombus formation within aortic endoprostheses has been described to occur in up to one-third of aortic endografts depending on the device type. Data regarding the clinical significance of such a phenomenon are scarce, but in most cases it is considered to be clinically innocent. The authors describe a rare case of late renal artery occlusion due to intraprosthetic thrombus formation and extension into the right renal orifice 30 months after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Additionally, a brief literature review regarding the incidence and natural history of mural thrombotic deposits within aortic endografts is also conducted.
