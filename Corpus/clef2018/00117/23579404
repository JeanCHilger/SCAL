Renal artery stenosis and abdominal aorta aneurysm in patients with pseudoexfoliation syndrome. To evaluate the renal arteries and abdominal aorta in patients with pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PEX).Prospective, case-control study.The study involved 49 patients with PEX and 42 control subjects. Abdominal aorta and renal arteries were examined by Doppler ultrasonography. In both renal arteries (proximal and distal portions) and abdominal aorta, the peak systolic velocity (PSV) was measured. Renal artery stenosis (RAS) was defined as the renal artery PSV >150 cm/s or renal-to-aortic ratio (RAR) >3.0. Patients who had an abdominal aortic diameter >3 cm were recorded. Computed tomographic angiography was performed to confirm these findings in patients with RAS and/or abdominal aorta aneurysm.The mean PSV in the proximal renal artery was 88.3 cm/s in PEX group and 79.5 cm/s in control group (P=0.314) in distal renal artery was 91.7 cm/s in PEX group and 93.0 cm/s in control group (P=0.794)Our study has demonstrated that there is a significant association between PEX and RAS. The abdominal aorta aneurysm may be seen in patients with PEX.
