Intraoperative evaluation of visceral arteries by transesophageal echocardiography during aortic fenestration. 76-year-old man was diagnosed with DeBakey type IIIb acute aortic dissection, for which he underwent axillo-femoral bypass surgery. Two days postoperatively, hematochezia developed suddenly. Laboratory data revealed AST 5,088 IU x l(-1), ALT 3,822 IU x l(-1), and CK 27,746 IU x l(-1) suggesting intestinal malperfusion due to stenosis of the celiac artery (CEA) and superior mesenteric artery (SMA). The abdominal aorta and visceral arteries were evaluated by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). Color Doppler imaging revealed increased blood flow velocity (4.0 m x sec(-1)) in CEA due to the stenosis, while that in SMA was decreased. Open abdominal aortic fenestration was performed. The aorta was clamped at the level of the infra-renal and inferior mesenteric arteries, and the septum between the false and true lumens was resected. On postoperative TEE assessment, CEA stenosis was resolved, and flow velocity was improved (3.0 m x sec(-1)). Color Doppler imaging demonstrated that fenestration resulted in recovery of SMA perfusion. Aortic fenestration is useful in the treatment of ischemic complications of aortic dissection. Its advantages include minimal invasiveness and short operative time. Bypass surgery and reoperation were avoided by evaluating visceral arteries by TEE in the case reported here.
