The Progression and Early detection of Subclinical Atherosclerosis (PESA) study: rationale and design. The presence of subclinical atherosclerosis is a likely predictor of cardiovascular events however, factors associated with the early stages and progression of atherosclerosis are poorly defined.The PESA study examines the presence of subclinical atherosclerosis by means of noninvasive imaging and prospectively analyzes the determinants associated with its development and progression in a middle-aged population.The PESA study is an observational, longitudinal and prospective cohort study in a target population of 4000 healthy subjects (40-54 years old, 35% women) based in Madrid (Spain). Recruitment began in June 2010 and will be completed by the end of 2013. Baseline examination consists of (1) assessment for cardiovascular risk factors (including lifestyle and psychosocial factors) (2) screening for subclinical atherosclerosis using 2D/3D ultrasound in carotid, abdominal aorta and iliofemoral arteries, and coronary artery calcium score (CACS) by computed tomographyThe PESA study is expected to identify new imaging and biological factors associated with the presence and progression of atherosclerosis in asymptomatic people and will help to establish a more personalized management of medical care.
