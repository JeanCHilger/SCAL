Safety and efficacy of ascending aorta cannulation during repair of acute type A aortic dissection (PA29-04): "Presented at the 65th Annual Scientific Meeting of the Japanese Association for Thoracic Surgery". Antegrade central perfusion for acute Stanford type A aortic dissection prevents malperfusion and retrograde cerebral embolism during cardiopulmonary bypass. Prompt establishment of antegrade perfusion via the ascending aorta may improve surgical results of type A dissections, especially in situations of hemodynamic instability. Thus, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of cannulation of the dissected ascending aorta in acute type A dissection.We reviewed the medical charts of patients undergoing repair of acute ascending aortic dissection (n = 52) from April 2010 to April 2013. Cannulation was accomplished in 29 patients via the ascending aorta (central) and in 23 patients via the femoral or axillary artery (peripheral). The ascending aorta was routinely cannulated using Seldinger technique under epiaortic ultrasound guidance. Comorbidities, mortality, complications, and durations of hospital stays were compared for the groups.In all cases, routine cannulation of the ascending aorta was safely performed with no resultant malperfusion or thromboembolism. Mean operative duration, cardiopulmonary bypass time, intubation time, and intensive care unit stay were significantly shorter in the central group. Two patients (6.8 %) in the central group died compared with four patients (17.3 %) in the peripheral group (P = 0.005).Antegrade central perfusion via the ascending aorta, a simple and safe technique that enables rapid establishment of antegrade systemic perfusion, was as safe as peripheral cannulation in patients with type A acute aortic dissection.
