Treatment of rupture of abdominal aortic aneurism in multi-field military hospital. For the last 5 years in the center of vascular surgery of Vishnevskiy 3rd Central Military Clinical Hospital 218 patients with abdominal aortic aneurism were treated, 96 planned surgical operations for abdominal aortic aneurism (post-operative mortality 3.1%) were performed. 11 patients underwent urgent surgical operation because of rupture of abdominal aortic aneurism. 1 of 11 patients died at the stage of laparotomy, the second patient died after clipping of ruptured aneurysm. In other 9 cases surgical operation was performed successfully. But 2 of 9 patients died in a few hours after surgery. In summary, 4 of 11 patients underwent surgical operation for rupture of abdominal aortic aneurism survived. The postoperative mortality was 63.6%. Authors gave an example of successful treatment of patient with rupture of abdominal aortic aneurism. It was concluded that successful treatment of rupture of abdominal aortic aneurism is possible only in case of well-run integration of different treatment and diagnostic departments. CT angiography is crucial for instrumental diagnostics of rupture of abdominal aortic aneurism. Successful surgical operation is impossible without organized blood supply service, refusion and donor blood. Artificial lung ventilation, extracorporal detoxication and adequate pharmacological supply help to avoid severe complications during the postoperative period, even in patients with associated pathology.
