Use of polypropylene mesh in the management of a contaminated large ventral hernia: a contraindication or a solution? Management of contaminated large ventral hernias is still a challenge as a result of massive loss of muscular and fascial tissues in the abdominal wall, traditional contraindication to use of a prosthesis, and complicated perioperative management. This study aimed to provide a solution for this challenging dilemma using monofilament polypropylene mesh (Marlex Bard) in the Sublay-Bridge fashion. Twenty-three consecutive patients with contaminated large ventral hernias from 2009 to 2011 were identified. Preoperatively, source of contamination at the surgical site was managed through oral antibiotics, wound d√©bridement, and dressing change
