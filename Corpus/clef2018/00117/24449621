Elevated serum gamma-glutamyltransferase levels in patients with dilated ascending aorta. This study aimed to evaluate the serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels as an indirect marker of elevated oxidative stress in patients with dilated ascending aorta.The study was designed as an observational cross-sectional controlled study. One hundred consecutive patients with dilated ascending aorta and 50 consecutive controls with normal ascending aorta diameter were selected for the study by comprehensive transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). The aortic dilatation group was divided into two subgroups, according to the literature as the ectasia group (3.8-4.3 cm, 53 patients, 24 male and 29 female, mean age: 62.9±10.9 years) and the aneurysm group (≥4.4 cm, 47 patients, 18 male and 29 female, mean age: 65.5±11.1 years). The control group consisted of patients demonstrating no ascending aorta dilatation (≤3.7 cm, 50 patients, 24 male and 26 female, mean age: 62.7±9.2 years). ANOVA, Mann-Whitney U test, Pearson's correlation analysis, multivariate logistic regression analysis, and receiver-operator curve analysis were used for statistical analysis.Regarding the comparison of laboratory parameters between the patient and control groups, serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels were found to be statistically significantly higher in both of the aortic dilatation subgroups than in the control group (p<0.001). In the correlation analysis between the ascending aorta diameter and GGT, a statistically significant positive correlation was found (r=0.282, p<0.001). The multivariate regression analysis revealed a significant relationship between GGT and the proximal ascending aorta diameter (β=0.131, odds ratio: 1.140, 95% CI: 1.060-1.225, p<0.001).GGT as a marker of oxidative stress may play a role in the pathogenesis of aneurysm of the ascending aorta.
