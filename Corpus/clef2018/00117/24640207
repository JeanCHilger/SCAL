Hepatobiliary tuberculosis. Hepatobiliary tuberculosis refers to the localized form of hepatic tuberculosis and is a distinct entity in which hepatobiliary involvement overwhelmingly dominates the clinical picture. Presentations are often delayed, and manifestations can be nonspecific. Fever is the most common symptom followed by abdominal pain, and hepatomegaly is the most common abnormality found on clinical examination. Abnormalities of the liver function tests are non-specific and hence not diagnostic. Ultrasound or computed tomography reveals single or complex masses, and guided biopsy is diagnostic either by demonstrating caseating granuloma or the organism by staining and culture. Treatment is with standard first-line antituberculous drugs. Endoscopic stenting gives an excellent outcome for symptomatic biliary strictures. The outcome in patients infected with Human Immunodeficiency virus depends on the level of underlying immunosuppression.
