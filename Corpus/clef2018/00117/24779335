Early hemodynamic performance of the BioValsalva valved conduit after aortic root replacement. The study aim was to examine the hemodynamic performance of the BioValsalva porcine aortic valve conduit in the aortic root position.Between February 2007 and April 2012, a total of 223 patients underwent aortic root replacement at the authors' institution. The BioValsalva valved conduit was implanted in 131 patients, and 86 of these patients (mean age 64.7 +/- 9.7 years) consented to participate in the present study. The parameters assessed to evaluate prosthetic valve function included mean pressure gradient (MPG) as measured by transthoracic Doppler echocardiography, and the effective orifice area (EOA) by means of the continuity equation. Hemodynamic data were obtained from all 86 patients within 10 days and six months postoperatively.The mean aortic cross-clamp time was 103 +/- 30 min. Concomitant procedures were performed in 50 patients (56.5%). Four patients developed valve dysfunction due to endocarditis, and underwent a reoperation without the need to perform a redo Bentall. The early MPG across the implanted valve was 12 +/- 4.6 mmHg (range: 4-24.8 mmHg), and the early mean EOA was 1.81 +/- 0.6 cm2 (range: 0.9-3.2 cm2). After six months the MPG was 11.6 +/- 4.6 mmHg (range: 2.2-25.5 mmHg) and the EOA was 1.69 +/- 0.43 cm2 (range: 0.8-2.6 cm2).Based on its special design with a stentless valve, which is not incorporated into the proximal suture line, the BioValsalva conduit has an advantage over intraoperatively prepared conduits in cases of reoperation. Besides simplified intraoperative handling, the BioValsalva conduit exhibits good systolic hemodynamic performance with large EOAs.
