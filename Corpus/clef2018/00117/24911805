Endovascular management of type Ib endoleak complicating a juxtarenal aortic aneurysm previously treated with a multilayer stent. To report the use of an endograft to manage a type Ib endoleak in a patient with a juxtarenal aortic aneurysm previously treated with a multilayer stent.Under compassionate use, a 68-year-old patient with a juxtarenal aortic aneurysm and multiple comorbidities was treated with a multilayer flow modulating stent. Twelve months later a new computed tomography (CT) scan identified a type Ib endoleak with an increase in the aortic aneurysm size because of the extension of the aneurysmal disease to the aortic carrefour. A new endovascular procedure was then performed, deploying an aorto-biiliac endoprosthesis. After 18 months, serial echocolor duplex and CT scans have shown normal visceral arteries patency, no signs of endoleak, and sac shrinkage of 5 mm.In this case, the Multilayer Aneurysm Repair System failed to treat the abdominal aortic aneurysm and required a reoperation with conventional-covered stent graft for distal sealing, which may be considered a feasible solution to manage potential endoleaks.
