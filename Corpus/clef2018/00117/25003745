Budd-Chiari syndrome in children: clinical features, percutaneous radiological intervention, and outcome. 'Radiological intervention' to restore venous patency is the preferred therapy in adults with Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS). The published literature on pediatric BCS is scarce. This study evaluated the clinical profile and role of a therapeutic radiological intervention in children with BCS.Forty-six BCS children [29 boys, median age 10.5 (2-16) years] were enrolled. Standard medical therapy was administered to all. A radiological intervention, angioplasty [hepatic vein (HV) (n=3)], stenting [HV (n=18), inferior vena cava (IVC) (n=5)], transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) (n=3), was performed in 25 cases. Clinical, biochemical, and radiological follow-up was carried out.Doppler ultrasonography was diagnostic in 95% of cases. All patients had chronic BCS, with ascites in 82.6%, hepatomegaly in 84.8%, splenomegaly in 69.6%, prominent abdominal veins in 69.6%, and variceal bleed in 34.8% cases. The most common site of block was HV (n=33), followed by combined HV and IVC block (n=11), and isolated IVC block (n=2). Eight of 12 (75%) cases had abnormal procoagulant workup. Radiological intervention was technically successful in 100%. Clinical and biochemical improvement was observed in the intervention group. Complications included neck hematoma and hemorrhagic ascites in one patient each. One child in the intervention group (post-TIPS sudden cardiac event) and two children in the nonintervention group [end-stage liver disease (n=1), head injury (n=1)] died. Stent was patent in 15/20 (75%) children over a median follow-up of 6.5 months.HV block and a chronic presentation are most common in BCS children. Doppler ultrasonography establishes the diagnosis in 95% of cases. Radiological intervention is an effective and safe therapeutic modality for children with BCS.
