Could four-dimensional contrast-enhanced ultrasound replace computed tomography angiography during follow up of fenestrated endografts? Results of a preliminary experience. To evaluate four-dimensional contrast-enhanced ultrasound (4D-CEUS) as an alternative imaging method to computed tomography angiography (CTA) during follow up of fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) for juxta- and para-renal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA).Between October 2011 and March 2012, all consecutive patients who underwent FEVAR follow up were included in the study and evaluated with both 4D-CEUS and CTA. The interval between the two examinations was always ≤ 30 days. Endpoints were the comparison of postoperative AAA diameter, AAA volume, presence of endoleaks, revascularized visceral vessel (RVV) visualization, and patency. Comparative analysis was performed using Bland-Altman plots and McNemar's Chi-square test.Twenty-two patients (96% male, 4% female mean age 74 ± 7 yearsThe data suggest that 4D-CEUS is as accurate as CTA in the evaluation of postoperative AAA diameter and volume, endoleak detection, and RVV patency after FEVAR. Four-dimensional CEUS could provide hemodynamic information regarding RVVs, and reduce radiation exposure and renal impairment during follow up. Obesity limits the diagnostic accuracy of 4D-CEUS.
