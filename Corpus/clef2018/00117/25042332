Type II endoleak: conservative management is a safe strategy. Type II endoleak is the most common complication after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) however, its natural history is unclear. The aim of this study was to examine the incidence and outcomes of type II endoleak, at a single institution after EVAR.A total of 904 consecutive patients who underwent EVAR between September 1995 and July 2013 at a single centre were entered onto a prospective database. All patients were followed up by duplex ultrasound (DUSS). Patients who developed type II endoleak were compared for preoperative demographics, mortality, and sac expansion.A total of 175(19%) patients developed type II endoleak over a median follow-up of 3.6 years (1.5-5.9 years) 54% of type II endoleaks spontaneously resolved within 6 months (0.25-1.2 years). No difference was found in preoperative demographics or choice of endograft between the two groups. Survival was significantly higher in the group with type II endoleak (94.1% vs. 85.6%Patients with isolated type II endoleak demonstrate equivalent aneurysm-related mortality and an improved survival.
