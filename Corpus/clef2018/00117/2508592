Pulsed Doppler echography in the quantification of aortic insufficiency in adults. Since several methods based on doppler-echocardiography have been suggested to quantify aortic valve regurgitation, we compared two of these methods--left ventricular diastolic jet mapping and evaluation of blood flow in the descending aorta--with the results of left heart catheterization in 82 patients with aortic regurgitation. The invasive quantification rested on the degree of left ventricular opacification after contrast injection into the supra-sigmoid aorta, the results being classified into 3 grades. Left ventricular mapping was carried out using pulsed doppler ultrasound by the apical route results were expressed as 3 grades of increasing severity. Blood flow in the aorta was recorded using pulsed doppler velocimetry by the suprasternal route at the level of the aortic isthmus where we measured the diastolic to systolic velocity integrals ratio (D/S). Apical mapping could be performed in 81 of the 82 patients, whereas suprasternal planimetry could be performed in only 56 patients (68 p. 100). Mapping provided good correlations with catheterization in 65 patients (80 p. 100)
