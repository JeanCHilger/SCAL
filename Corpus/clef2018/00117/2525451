Aneurysms of the abdominal aorta. Clinical evaluation and therapeutic criteria. On the basis of their own experience and of the most recent acquisitions published in the literature, the authors report on aneurysms of the abdominal aorta which are observed with increasing frequency. After discussing the etiopathogenesis, they dwell on the principal clinical problems of the disease, especially those concerning early diagnosis. Thanks to new acquisitions in vascular surgery, early detection may in fact allow of highly satisfactory therapeutic results.
