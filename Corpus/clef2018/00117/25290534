Safety and efficacy of endoscopic ultrasound-guided drainage of pancreatic fluid collections with lumen-apposing covered self-expanding metal stents. Plastic stents, placed via endoscopy to drain pancreatic fluid collections (PFCs), require repeat access. Covered metal stents are larger in diameter and can be inserted in a single step, but can migrate. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of a lumen-apposing, covered, self-expanding metal stent (LACSEMS) for PFC drainage.We performed a prospective study of the outcomes of stent placement in 33 patients (18 men age, 53 ± 14 yThe mean size of the patients' PFCs was 9 ± 3.3 cm. LACSEMSs were placed successfully via endoscopic ultrasound guidance in 30 patients (91%) the remaining 3 patients received 2 double-pigtail stents. One subject could not be evaluated because of a pseudoaneurysm. In the patients receiving LACSEMS, PFCs resolved in 27 of 29 (93%). Overall, PFCs resolved in 30 of 33 patients (91%). Endoscopic debridement through the LACSEMS was conducted in 11 subjects. Complications (15%) included abdominal pain (n = 3), spontaneous stent migration, back pain (n = 1), access-site infection, and stent dislodgement (n = 1).LACSEMS were placed successfully in 91% of subjects with PFCs. Overall, 93% had PFC resolution. Advantages of LACSEMSs over other stents include single-step deployment and the ability to perform endoscopic debridement with minimal stent migration.
