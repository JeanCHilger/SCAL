Endovascular sac sealing concept: will the Endologix Nellix™ device solve the deficiencies? The deficiencies in current endovascular aneurysm repair include limited applicability to treat aneurysm anatomies, a significant reintervention rate to manage postprocedural complications and a requirement for postprocedural surveillance. Endovascular aneurysm sealing with the Nellix™ device offers the potential to address these issues by directly treating the aneurysm sac and minimizing the risk of endoleak of any type as well as device migration. The unique sealing technology of polymer filled endobags also provides an opportunity to treat aneurysm anatomies that could not be effectively treated with conventional endografts. The early clinical experience with Nellix™ supports these concepts but long-term durability is yet to be established.
