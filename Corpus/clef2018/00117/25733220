24-Month Data from the BRAVISSIMO: A Large-Scale Prospective Registry on Iliac Stenting for TASC A & B and TASC C & D Lesions. To evaluate the 24-month outcome of stenting in Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) A & B and TASC C & D iliac lesions in a controlled setting.The BRAVISSIMO study is a prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter, multinational, monitored registry including 325 patients with aortoiliac lesions. The end point is the primary patency at 24 months, defined as a target lesion without a hemodynamically significant stenosis on duplex ultrasound (>50%, systolic velocity ratio >2.0). A separate analysis for TASC A & B versus TASC C & D population is performed.Between July 2009 and September 2010, 190 patients with TASC A or B and 135 patients with TASC C or D aortoiliac lesions were included. The demographic data were comparable for TASC A & B cohort and TASC C & D cohort. Technical success was 100%. Significantly more balloon-expandable stents were deployed in TASC A & B lesions, and considerably more self-expanding stents were placed in TASC C & D (P = 0.01). The 24-month primary patency rate after 24 months for the total population was 87.9% (88.0% for TASC A, 88.5% for TASC B, 91.9% for TASC C, and 84.8% for TASC D). No statistically significant difference was shown when comparing these groups. The 24-month primary patency rates were 92.1% for patients treated with the self-expanding stent, 85.2% for patients treated with the balloon-expandable stent, and 75.3% for patients treated with a combination of both stents (P = 0.06). Univariate and multivariable regression analyses using Cox proportional hazards model identified only kissing stent configuration (P = 0.0012) and obesity (P = 0.0109) as independent predictors of restenosis (primary patency failure). Interestingly, as all TASC groups enjoyed high levels of patency, neither TASC category nor lesion length was predictive of restenosis.The 24-month data from this large, prospective, multicenter study confirm that endovascular therapy may be considered the preferred first-line treatment option of iliac lesions, irrespectively of TASC lesion category.
