Endovascular Treatment of Occlusive Lesions in the Aortic Bifurcation with Kissing Polytetrafluoroethylene-Covered Stents. To determine the clinical outcomes of polytetrafluoroethylene covered balloon expandable stents (CBESs) in occlusive lesions of the aortic bifurcation in a kissing stent configuration.The study included 69 consecutive patients (29 men, 40 women) who underwent kissing stent procedures with CBESs between January 2003 and April 2009 in a single center. Patients who were previously treated with a CBES were excluded. Follow-up consisted of clinical investigation and duplex ultrasound examination.The primary patency was 88.1% at 1 year and 71.5% at 4 years, with secondary patency rates of 88.1% and 75.3%, respectively. For patients receiving a stent for the first time, primary patency was 91.3% at 1 year and 77.1% at 4 years. For patients who had received previous stents, patency was 83.6% at 1 year and 65.2% at 4 years (P = .83). There were no differences in secondary patency and freedom from target lesion reintervention (TLR). Loss of primary patency was mainly caused by stent occlusions (14 cases [78%]). The freedom from TLR at 4 years was 76.8%.Patency rates and freedom from TLR of CBESs in the kissing stent configuration with up to 4 years of follow-up were satisfying and mainly affected by stent occlusions. Studies focusing on optimizing stent configuration and medical care to reduce the incidence of thrombosis are indicated to improve results further.
