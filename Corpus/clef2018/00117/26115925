The prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysm is consistently high among patients with coronary artery disease. Emerging evidence suggests high prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) among patients with coronary disease. Accurate characterization of the association between coronary disease and AAA and of the actual prevalence of AAA among patients with angiography-verified coronary artery disease (CAD) is needed to evaluate the possible benefits of systematic screening for AAA.We searched for studies that reported the association between AAA and CAD or coronary heart disease (CHD wider phenotype definition) in the general population (randomized controlled trials, prospective population cohorts) and those that reported the prevalence of AAA among patients with angiography-verified CAD through PubMed, Embase, and reference lists for the period between 1980 and 2014. Random-effects models were applied because of the high heterogeneity between included studies.Among the general population, 23 studies reported the association between CHD and the occurrence of subclinical AAA (positive ultrasound screening meta-analyzed odds ratio of 2.38 with 95% confidence interval [CI] of 1.78-3.19The risk of subclinical AAA and future AAA events is high among patients with coronary disease. Screening for AAA among CAD patients by cardiologists would be easy and inexpensive, with possible benefits to survival and risk evaluation.
