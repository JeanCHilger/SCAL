Long-term results of the valve reimplantation technique using a graft with sinuses. Aortic valve reimplantation is the most commonly used technique to spare the aortic valve. Long-term results data are scarce and available only with the use of standard straight graft. We examined the long-term results of reimplantation of the aortic valve using a graft incorporating sinuses of Valsalva.From May 2000 to December 2014, 124 patients had an aortic valve reimplanted into a graft with sinuses of Valsalva. The mean age was 53 ± 13 years and the majority were men (87%). Marfan syndrome was present in 21 patients (17%) and 12% had a bicuspid valve. Patients were prospectively followed by means of transthoracic echocardiography. The mean follow-up was 63 ± 52 months.Overall survival at 5, 10, and 13 years was 94.4% ± 2.2%, 90.5% ± 4.4%, and 81.4% ± 7.3%, respectively. Six patients required reoperation within a time frame of 6 to 96 months. None of the patients died at reoperation. Freedom from reoperation was 95.4% ± 2.3% at 5 years and 90.1% ± 4.3% at 10 and 13 years. All patients who needed reoperation had surgery during the first 5 years. Three patients had residual aortic insufficiency >2. Considering also all patients who underwent reoperation because of aortic insufficiency, freedom from moderate to severe residual aortic insufficiency was 94.1% ± 2.6% at 5 years, and 87.1% ± 4.7% at 10 and 13 years.The majority of patients who had their valve reimplanted in a graft with sinuses continue to perform well after 10 years.
