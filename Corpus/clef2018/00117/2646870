Imaging of abdominal aortic aneurysms. There is no single correct approach to evaluate aortic aneurysm. Variations in individual cases, equipment availability, technical expertise, and surgeons' preference frequently dictate the workup. Sonography is optimal for screening and follow-up in uncomplicated cases. CT is excellent in preoperative and postoperative evaluation of aneurysms and their potential complications. Angiography is used to determine visceral-branch involvement and define variations in vascular anatomy, although its routine preoperative use is controversial. MR imaging has emerged as a powerful tool to visualize and stage aneurysms.
