Traumatic fistula between the aorta and the left renal vein: case report and review of the literature. This report of an aorto-left renal vein fistula (ALRVF) of traumatic origin is the sixth such case on record. The fistula was successfully repaired, with preservation of the kidney, by autotransfusion. Review of the English language literature revealed the differences between spontaneous and traumatic ALRVF. Spontaneous fistulas were caused by rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm into a retroaortic left renal vein. Hematuria was almost constant (93% of cases). The operative mortality rate was 14%. By contrast, traumatic ALRVFs were the result of a penetrating wound to the abdomen. The left renal vein was in a normal position, anterior to the aorta. Hematuria was less common (16% of cases). The diagnosis was delayed because clinical signs were less acute. There were no reports of postoperative deaths.
