Aortocoronary bypass without extracorporeal circulation: why and when? Thirty patients have been operated on since July 1986. The mean age was 55 years (range 32-68). Twenty-three simple and 7 double bypasses were performed. The internal mammary artery and 1 prosthetic conduit were used for the 29 left anterior descending (LAD) anastomoses and saphenous vein for the others [5 right coronary artery (RCA), 3 diagonal]. The use of an implantable Doppler probe for continuous monitoring during the 1st postoperative week confirmed patency and gave an estimated flow (mean: 79.23 ml/min, range 43.4). There were no deaths and no cases of infarction or ischaemia, but stress test performance improved. The main advantage of this rapid and safe technique was avoidance of morbidity of extracorporeal circulation (ECC) and limited operative myocardial ischaemia. Criteria of selection were unstable, permanent angina (14) unsuccessful PTCA (8) PTCA and failure (5 emergency cases), redo surgery (4)
