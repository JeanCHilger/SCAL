Clinical and ultrasound results after aortic valve replacement: intermediate-term follow-up with the St. Jude Medical prosthesis. Mortality, morbidity, quality of life, and left ventricular (LV) function were evaluated in 49 patients after aortic valve replacement with the St. Jude prosthesis. Total follow-up was 2577 patient-months survivors were followed-up for 4 to 7 years by clinical examination and echocardiography. The actuarial survival rate at 6 years was 79.6%, and there were no valve-related deaths. The linearized rates for thromboembolism and hemorrhage were 0.93% and 3.26% per patient-year, respectively. In 34% of the survivors the quality of life was poor. In the first three postoperative months, patients with aortic stenosis (n = 12) had a significant decrease in the muscle cross-sectional area (p less than 0.01) and patients with aortic regurgitation (n = 11) had decreases in both LV end-diastolic diameter (p less than 0.05) and cross-sectional area (p less than 0.001). All of these results were maintained at 5 years without modification of LV systolic function. Despite the good overall results, six patients deteriorated and had major LV dilatation. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified two independent preoperative variables associated with a poor outcome defined as death of LV dysfunction (p less than 0.05): age and end-diastolic diameter. Thus meticulous follow-up showed a high incidence of hemorrhage and a poor quality of life in many of the survivors. It was concluded that in high-risk patients (age and end-diastolic diameter) surgery should probably be considered earlier.
