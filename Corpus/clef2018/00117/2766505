Continuous wave Doppler echocardiographic measurement of prosthetic valve gradients. A simultaneous Doppler-catheter correlative study. Studies correlating prosthetic valve gradients determined by continuous wave Doppler echocardiography with gradients obtained by cardiac catheterization have, to date, been limited to patients with mitral and tricuspid prostheses or have compared nonsimultaneous measurements. Simultaneous Doppler and catheter pressure gradients in 36 patients (mean age, 63 +/- 13 years) with 42 prosthetic valves (20 aortic, 20 mitral, one tricuspid, and one pulmonary) were studied. Catheter gradients were obtained using a dual-catheter technique. The simultaneous pressure tracings and Doppler flow velocity profiles were digitized at 10-msec intervals to derive the corresponding maximal and mean gradients. The correlation between the maximal Doppler gradient and the simultaneously measured maximal catheter gradient was 0.94 (SEE = 6), and that between the Doppler gradient and the simultaneously measured mean catheter gradient was 0.96 (SEE = 3). There were no significant differences in correlation between gradients for the 32 mechanical valves (maximal gradients: r = 0.95, SEE = 6 mean gradients: r = 0.96, SEE = 3) and the 10 bioprosthetic valves (maximal gradients: r = 0.89, SEE = 6
