False aneurysms after prosthetic reconstructions for aortoiliac obstructive disease. Several aspects of false aneurysm development after prosthetic resconstruction for aortoiliac obstructive disease were studied. For this purpose the long-term results (up to 20 years of follow-up) of 518 patients with implanted arterial prostheses in the aortoiliofemoral tract were retrospectively evaluated. Completeness of follow-up data was 83.2% 15 years after operation. A total of 101 false aneurysms (21 aortic, 53 iliac, and 27 femoral) were detected in 69 patients and verified by operation. The incidence per patient was 69 of 518 patients (13.3%). The incidences per anastomosis were: aortic, 21 of 438 anastomoses (4.8%) iliac, 53 of 835 anastomoses (6.3%)
