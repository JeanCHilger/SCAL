Detection of renal artery stenosis: experimental and clinical analysis of velocity waveforms. Mass screening of hypertensive patients by a noninvasive method could uncover the 10% of those cases where renal artery stenosis is the primary etiology. Treatment by transluminal angioplasty or surgery could replace a long-term medical regimen. To investigate an ultrasonic technique, normal velocity waveforms were obtained from the abdominal aorta, celiac artery and renal arteries in seven mongrel dogs using a 5 MHz, continuous-wave Doppler detector. Renal artery pressure gradients, volume flow rates and velocity recordings were subsequently made during induced proximal renal artery stenoses. The ratio of peak renal artery frequency to peak aortic frequency was 88% sensitive to stenoses of greater than 20 mm Hg pressure gradient, while the renal artery systolic frequency window was 79% sensitive to the same obstructions. Ninety-five hypertensive and vascular surgical patients were examined using a 3 MHz duplex scanner with 175 of the 190 (92%) renal arteries adequately detected (clear signal with high diastolic component). Analysis of velocity waveforms based on peak frequency, proximal to distal peak frequency changes, evidence of flow disturbances and associated bruit were compared to contrast arteriograms in 84 vessels. Of the 76 (90%) arteries adequately examined by duplex scanning, 59 of 61 (97%) with 0-59% diameter reduction, 10 of 12 (83%) with 60-99% diameter reduction and 1 of 3 (33%) occlusions were correctly identified. Velocity waveform analysis can accurately detect renal artery stenosis and may prove effective in mass screening of hypertensive patients for renovascular disease.
