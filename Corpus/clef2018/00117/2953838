Pre- and postoperative Doppler ultrasound findings in coarctation of the aorta. A retrospective study was done about 73 patients who had undergone a surgical operation for correction of coarctation of the aorta, between 1975 and 1985. Among these patients, 45 had both pre- and post-operative continuous wave Doppler ultrasound examination of cervical, upper, and lower limbs arteries, with pressure measurement. The age was under 14 years for 18 patients, between 14 and 25 for 10 patients, and more than 25 for the remaining 17 patients. The surgical procedure was resection with end-to-end anastomosis for 27 patients, tube graft insertion for 8 patients, dacron patch for 7 patients, subclavian arterioplasty or shunt for the others. Systolic Pressure Index and femoral Pulsatility Index showed a highly significant increase after operation (P less than 0.001) (tables I, II) regardless of the age or the surgical technique, thus demonstrating a satisfying hemodynamic efficiency of the correction (fig. 1-6) (2-6, 9). Nevertheless, 17 patients had, after operation, a greater than 15 Hg mm pressure gradient between left and right arm: the retrospective study showed that most of them had congenital abnormalities involving the left subclavian artery and/or had undergone a surgical procedure using the left subclavian artery for arterioplasty (10).
