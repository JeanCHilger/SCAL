Color Doppler flow mapping in cardiomyopathies and prosthetic valves. The clinical significance of color Doppler flow mapping was assessed in patients with cardiomyopathies and prosthetic valves. Left and right ventricular obstruction and mitral regurgitation can be detected in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Specific flow patterns in the left ventricle are clearly demonstrated in dilated cardiomyopathy. Concomitant regurgitation is easily detected in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. The major role of this technique in patients with prosthetic valves exists in the detection of prosthetic valve regurgitation. In bioprosthetic valves, differentiation between transvalvular and paravalvular regurgitation is possible. The specific complications following the mechanical valve implantation, such as an aorto-right ventricular and aorto-left ventricular communication, can be detected using this technique. Although some problems remain, this technique is useful in the management of patients with cardiomyopathies and prosthetic valves.
