X-ray diagnosis of thoracic aorta ruptures. One hundred and twenty-two patients were examined in order to diagnose, or for follow-up of, acute or chronic traumatic rupture of the thoracic aorta sixty-two had arterial angiography, thirty-three had intravenous digital subtraction angiography, thirty-one had computer tomograms and seventeen were examined by ultrasound. In addition, plain films were evaluated in forty-two cases. The value of these methods in diagnosing acute or chronic aneurysms is analysed and discussed. Arterial angiography was the best method for acute aneurysms, whereas in the sub-acute and chronic stages CT and DSA are indicated.
