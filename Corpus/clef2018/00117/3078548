Normal values of prosthetic valve Doppler echocardiographic parameters: a review. Doppler echocardiography plays an important role in the evaluation of patients with prosthetic valves. The evaluation of flow velocities across prosthetic valves is more complicated compared with native valves, and flow velocities are specific for various types, positions, and sizes of prostheses. Because all prosthetic valves are at least mildly stenotic and a significant proportion is regurgitant, information regarding normally functioning prosthetic valves is important. Eighteen studies resulting in data on 1105 patients with normally functioning prosthetic valves were reviewed. Significant differences among the various types and sizes of prosthetic valves were found in both the aortic and mitral positions. The results are summarized in tables and figures that can be used for reference in a clinical laboratory.
