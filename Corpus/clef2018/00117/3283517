Intraoperative ultrasound imaging and its application to cardiovascular operations. Intraoperative ultrasound imaging was employed for qualitative and quantitative studies during cardiovascular operations in 36 patients. A 7.5M Hz high frequency ultrasound scanner was used to image. The ultrasound probe was sterilized by gas and placed directly on the heart by the hand of surgeon. On the clinical application, 10 cases of patients with coronary artery disease were scanned. Left main trunk and proximal portion of other three branches were visualized and pathological lesions were demonstrated clearly. Four cases of myocardial bridging were observed. Intramyocardial coronary arteries were easily detected and supraarterial myotomy was performed safely. Four cases of valvular disease were examined. We could evaluate valvular anatomy and physiologic aspects of valvular disease and 15 cases of aortic root disease were examined intraoperatively. In aortic root dissection, the size and site of the true and false lumens were clearly demonstrated in all patients. In conclusion intraoperative ultra-sound imaging is a versatile technique with quantitative and qualitative studies of cardiovascular surgery during operation and the perioperative period.
