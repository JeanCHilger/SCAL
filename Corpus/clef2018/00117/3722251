The value of intravenous digital subtraction angiography (IV-DSA) in the pre-operative assessment of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Twenty patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm were investigated by intravenous digital subtraction angiography (IV-DSA) and the usefulness of this technique as a pre-operative procedure is evaluated. All the patients had, in addition, either conventional aortography, computed tomography, ultrasound or a combination of all three and the results compared with the IV-DSA. It is suggested that IV-DSA is a useful and safe initial investigation for the pre-operative assessment of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms.
