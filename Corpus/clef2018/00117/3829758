Doppler echocardiographic detection of a ruptured acquired aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva. Clinical-morphologic correlations. Two-dimensional, pulsed Doppler echocardiographic and pathologic features of an unusual form of ruptured aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva are presented. The presence of an aneurysm of the left sinus of Valsalva protruding into the left atrium complicating acute aortic valvular endocarditis was detected by two-dimensional echocardiography. Rupture of the aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva into the left atrial cavity was suggested by pulsed Doppler echocardiography. The size and location of the site of the rupture precluded recognition by two-dimensional echocardiography or contrast angiography. This report illustrates the unique value of pulsed Doppler echocardiography to define the location and direction of intracardiac flow patterns in evaluating patients with an aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva and suspected rupture.
