Echo-Doppler (duplex) ultrasonic scanning. The combination of pulsed echo with pulsed Doppler provides a system that is capable of imaging peripheral arteries and veins and evaluating velocity patterns across suspected areas of narrowing. The method has been most widely applied to the evaluation of carotid artery disease for the detection and grading of lesions in the carotid bulb. Recent experience has suggested that the technique may also be applied to the vessels of the limb, the abdominal aorta, visceral arteries, and the deep veins. The use of this method is indicated for screening purposes and long-term follow-up of patients who have or have not had surgery.
