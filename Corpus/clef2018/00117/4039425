Aortic surgery and sexual function. An account is offered of the haemodynamic and neurological questions posed by the relation between reconstructive aortoiliac surgery and sexual function. Attention is drawn to the anatomical and surgical features of the preaortic sympathetic structures. In the light of experience gained in pelvic haemodynamic evaluation with the Doppler penile pressure index, a method that has proved very useful in the study of pre- and postoperative impotence in the arteriopathic subject, stress is laid on three conclusions: a) the high frequency of impotence in aortoiliac arteriopathy (65% in a personal series) b) the beneficial effect on penile circulation of revascularisation of the hypogastric artery (increase in pressure index in 70% of cases)
