Sonographic problems in the assessment of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Ultrasound has taken a solid position in the diagnostic management of aneurysms of the abdominal aorta as it is a non-invasive, simple and quickly practicable method with a low expenditure. After clinical examination ultrasound holds the second place in the sequence of various diagnostic procedures in the case of an aneurysm of abdominal aorta. Diagnostic problems are demonstrated in the sonographic judgement of aortic aneurysms. 42 patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm have been evaluated in relation to the sonographic features of the aneurysm.
