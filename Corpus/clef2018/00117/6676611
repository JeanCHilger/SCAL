Sonographic follow-up of endoscopic papillotomy, percutaneous transhepatic drainage and endoscopically implanted bile duct prosthesis. Normal transpapillary bile flow after EPT with or without implantation of bile duct draining catheters can be checked by sonographic demonstration of air in the bile ducts and/or normal calibers of the bile duct system. The position of percutaneous transhepatic catheters within the liver can be shown by sonography after insufflation of air into the catheter in most cases this will allow to ascertain the correct location in the bile duct system or the dislocation of the catheter into the abdominal cavity. After EPT, PTD or endoscopic implantation of bile duct draining catheters sonography should be the first line procedure in controlling the success of the intervention before x-ray examination or endoscopy are applied.
