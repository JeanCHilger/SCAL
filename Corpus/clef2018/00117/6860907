Axillofemoral and femorofemoral grafts: a 6-year experience with emphasis on the relationship of peroperative flow measurement to graft survival. Over a 6-year period 64 axillofemoral bypass and femorofemoral crossover grafts have been performed in 58 patients, most of whom were considered unfit for intra-abdominal surgery. Indications were peripheral ischaemia in 78 per cent and disabling claudication in 22 per cent. The limb salvage rate at 3 years was 75 per cent. No claudicants lost limbs, but only one-third of patients presenting with forefoot gangrene or ulceration avoided amputation. Most patients presenting with ischaemic symptoms at rest had associated femoropopliteal and distal disease, confirmed by the ankle pressure index measurements, and this influenced graft patency. Although the cumulative patency at 3 years for all grafts combined was 57 per cent with similar patencies for both the axillofemoral and femorofemoral grafts, early occlusion was more common in axillofemoral grafts and this may be reduced in bifemoral grafts by the increased flow rate in the vertical limbs. Peroperative electromagnetic flowmeter measurements were made after reconstruction on 55 femoral arteries in 46 of the patients and graft flow velocities were derived from these measurements. Comparison between velocities from those grafts remaining patent and those subsequently occluding showed a high incidence of occlusion in grafts with a maximal velocity after distal vasodilatation of less than 8 cm/s. Graft occlusion after the first postoperative month was more commonly associated with other factors such as continued smoking, severity of distal disease and perigraft infection.
