Prospective randomized study of concomitant lumbar sympathectomy with aortoiliac reconstruction. Ninety-three consecutive patients for aortofemoral bypass grafting were studied to determine the effect of sympathectomy on early and late patency, the need for subsequent distal procedures, amputation rate, and ankle-brachial Doppler systolic pressure indexes. Sixty-seven patients completed the study. Fifty-three limbs were randomized to receive sympathectomy and 81 no sympathectomy. The mean length of follow-up postoperatively was 11 +/- 2.53 months (maximum 24). Five grafts occluded, two early and three late. Both early occlusions occurred in the nonsympathectomy group and all three late occlusions ensued in the sympathectomy group. Subsequent distal procedures were necessary early (within 30 days) in five limbs, all in the nonsympathectomy group. Nine limbs required distal procedures late, four (5 percent) in the nonsympathectomy group and five (9.5 percent) in the sympathectomy group (p greater than 0.05). Altogether, distal bypass was required in 11 percent of the patients in the nonsympathectomy group versus 9.4 percent in the sympathectomy group (p greater than 0.05). Five limbs were amputated 4 to 14 months after aortofemoral bypass, four (5 percent) in the nonsympathectomy and one (2 percent) in the sympathectomy group (p greater than 0.05). The ankle-brachial pressure index increased significantly after aortofemoral bypass in both groups (p less than 0.05). The mean increase after aortofemoral bypass was more marked in the sympathectomy group (p greater than 0.05). Thus, at a mean follow-up time of 11 months after aortofemoral bypass, there was no significant difference in graft patency, need for subsequent distal bypass, or amputation rate between the sympathectomy and nonsympathectomy groups.
