Preoperative aortography before abdominal aortic aneurysmectomy? A review of 100 consecutive patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysmectomy was made to assess the value and necessity of preoperative aortography. Comparison of arteriography with physical examination, plain roentgenograms and ultrasonography suggests that angiography is required only for evaluation of specific problems. Indications for the selective use of preoperative aortography are proposed.
