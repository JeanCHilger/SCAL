Clinical evaluation of pulse-Doppler device linked to gray scale B-scan equipment. A pulse Doppler device linked to a commercially available B-mode ultrasound scanner permits the origin of the Doppler signals to be located accurately on the B-scan by a bright-up cursor. Case histories illustrate the clinical application of this device in differentiating between vascular and nonvascular structures, or patent and thrombosed vessels. This is especially valuable when there is pathological distortion of the anatomy.
