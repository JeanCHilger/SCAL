Sonographic evaluation of iliac artery aneurysms. Abdominal aortic aneurysms are not uncommon and their ultrasonic characteristics have become well-known. Ultrasonic detection of iliac artery aneurysms however, has not been well documented. Experience with 125 ultrasonic examinations for clinically suspected absoeminal aortic aneurysms is presented herein. Fifty-two abdominal aortic aneurysms were detected. Six unsuspected iliac artery aneurysms were demonstrated using a special oblique projection. Routine use of this oblique projection in patients with suspected abdominal aortic aneurysms is discussed.
