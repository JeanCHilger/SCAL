Quantification and monitoring of vascular resistance in the lower limbs by the Doppler method (animal model). The object of this study was to define and validate a non-invasive method of evaluation and monitoring of vascular resistances in the leg. Blood flow velocity was measured by Doppler ultrasound in an animal model (ewe) with similar blood flow characteristics in the lower limb as man and allowing access to the required invasive measurements for validation of the method (pressure and flow). Vascular resistances distal to the measuring point (femoral, for example) were assessed using the resistance index R = D/S, S being the peak systolic deflection and D that of diastolic reflux of the Doppler spectral analysis of flow in the femoral artery. The values and variations of this resistance index were compared with the vascular resistances calculated from measurements of pressure and flow at the point of Doppler sampling and expressed in mmHg/ml/min. Femoral flow was measured by Doppler ultrasound (Doppler-echo), and mean pressure by an arterial catheter introduced into the abdominal aorta. Compression of the lower limb veins induced a venous return resulting in a reduction of cardiac output and femoral flow. During compression, femoral flow decreased by an average of 29% (p < 0.001) although mean pressure and heart rate did not change significantly. The femoral resistance index (Rf) increased by an average of 37.5% (p < 0.01) and vascular resistances increased by 45.9% (p < 0.01). Injection of 1 mg adrenaline induced peripheral vasoconstriction with an increase in blood pressure and a decrease in heart rate and femoral flow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
