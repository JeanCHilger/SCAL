Evaluation of the hemodynamic performance of small CarboMedics aortic prostheses using dobutamine-stress Doppler echocardiography. The well-known correlation between prosthetic valve orifice area and transvalvular gradients has raised concerns about the presence of significant residual gradients when the size of the prosthesis that can be implanted is limited by the presence of a small aortic annulus.Dobutamine-stress Doppler echocardiography was used to evaluate the hemodynamic performance of small CarboMedics aortic prostheses (19 mm and 21 mm) in 18 patients (16 women mean age, 64 years) who had undergone aortic valve replacement 23.5 +/- 19 months (standard deviation) previously. Dobutamine infusion was started at a rate of 5 micrograms.kg-1.min-2 and increased to 10 and 20 micrograms.kg-1.min-2 at 15-minute intervals. Pulsed and continuous wave Doppler studies were performed at rest and at the end of each stage. Effective orifice area, performance index, and discharge coefficient of both valves were calculated, and peak and mean velocity and pressure drop across the prostheses were measured.Heart rate and cardiac output increased by 74% and 94%, respectively, and mean arterial blood pressure decreased by 9% at maximum stress. Effective orifice area, discharge coefficient, and performance index were comparable in both valve sizes at rest and maximum stress. Also, there was no significant difference in mean transvalvular pressure drop (gradient) for 19-mm and 21-mm prostheses at rest (8.1 +/- 8.4 and 4.8 +/- 3.8 mm Hg) or maximum stress (15.1 +/- 14.2 and 8.8 +/- 5.8 mm Hg, respectively). No significant correlation could be demonstrated between transvalvular pressure drop and patient's body surface area.These data show that 19-mm and 21-mm CarboMedics aortic prostheses exhibit equally favorable hemodynamic performance with minimal pressure gradient, both at rest and under stress conditions.
