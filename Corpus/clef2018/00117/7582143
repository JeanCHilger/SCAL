Total aortic root replacement with pulmonary autografts: short term results in 45 consecutive patients. From March 1992 through March 1995 we have performed 45 Ross procedures for total aortic root replacement in our institution. There were 32 males and 13 females with a mean age of 31 years (range: 3-49 years). Indications for surgery were: aortic stenosis (n = 20), aortic regurgitation (n = 16), native valve endocarditis (n = 6), replacement of prosthetic valve (n = 3). Of these 45 patients 13 (28%) had at least one prior repair. Additional procedures were Dacron graft extension of the autograft (n = 7), enlargement of aortic annulus (n = 3), mitral valve repair (n = 2), CABG (n = 1), closure of VSD (n = 1). The mean cross-clamp time was 132 minutes (76-187 minutes) and the mean bypass time 156 minutes (106-240 minutes). There were two postoperative cardiac deaths, not valve-related, and five non-lethal postoperative complications: right ventricular failure (n = 1), low cardiac output (n = 1), sternal re-entry for bleeding (n = 3). The follow up is complete (1.5-37 months) for the 43 survivors. There was one non-cardiac late death (acute fulminating hepatitis) in an eight years old boy eight months post-operatively. Discharge echo-Doppler studies showed normal autograft and homograft valve function except in one patient who had a grade two aortic regurgitation. Serial echo-Doppler studies showed no significant progression of aortic regurgitation, no significant pulmonary gradients, no dilatation of the autografts during the follow up. It is suggested in conclusion that aortic root replacement with a pulmonary autograft is a safe procedure in selected patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
