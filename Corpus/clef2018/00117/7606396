Transfemoral insertion of a bifurcated endovascular graft for aortic aneurysm repair: the first 22 patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and optimize a system of transfemoral bifurcated graft insertion for endovascular repair of infrarenal aortic aneurysm. Grafts were inserted through bilateral femoral arteriotomies in 22 patients. Placement was guided by fluoroscopy. Results were assessed by completion angiography, with computed tomography scanning or duplex ultrasonography at 1, 3 and 6 months. The first 11 insertions were complicated by failed insertion in two cases, proximal leakage in one, graft limb thrombosis in five and wound infection in one. The second 11 insertions were complicated by retrograde leakage around the distal graft orifice in two patients. One of these was associated with aneurysm rupture, leading to the sole mortality of the series. There were no instances of graft migration or embolism. In conclusion, the lessons learned during the first 11 insertions were responsible for the improved results apparent in the second 11 insertions. When applied in properly selected patients, transfemoral insertion of a bifurcated graft is a reliable method of isolating an aortic aneurysm from the circulation.
