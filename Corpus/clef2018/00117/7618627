Echocardiographic assessment of aortic valve replacement with stentless porcine xenografts. Stentless porcine xenografts (SPXs) implanted in the aortic position have potential hemodynamic advantages over traditional valve prostheses because of the lack of a rigid stent. Twenty-four patients (mean age 59 years) who underwent aortic valve replacement with SPXs were studied by echocardiography early after and 26 +/- 10 months (range 8 to 40) after operation. Peak and mean gradients, as well as aortic valve area, did not change significantly from baseline (16.3 +/- 8 and 9.8 +/- 5.6 mm Hg, and 1.78 +/- 0.63 cm2, respectively) to follow-up study (12.5 +/- 5 and 7.7 +/- 3 mm Hg, and 1.8 +/- 0.65 cm2, respectively). At baseline, color flow Doppler imaging showed aortic valve regurgitation where the leaflets coapted centrally in 17 of 24 patients (trivial, n = 14 mild, n = 3). Besides the central leak, paravalvular regurgitation was seen in 4 patients (trivial, n = 3
