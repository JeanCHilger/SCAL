In vitro evaluation of endovascular stents to assess suitability for endovascular graft fixation. To compare and ascertain the suitability for endovascular aortic graft fixation of the Palmaz stent, the Strecker stent, the modified Gianturco-Z stent, the Wallstent and a new stent made of the shape memory alloy nitinol. DESIGN, SETTING AND MATERIALS: In vitro studies using a simple tensiometer to assess the forces required to distract each stent from porcine aorta and using a high-pressure, pulsatile-flow pump to measure flow rates required to dislodge stents holding grafts within porcine aortas, with assessment using endovascular ultrasound.The Palmaz, the modified Gianturco-Z and the nitinol stents resisted significantly greater distraction forces than the Wallstent, but endovascular ultrasound examination revealed that the modified Gianturco-Z stent was seen to move away from the aortic wall at high flow rates precluding adequate fixation. The Strecker stent could not be assessed using these techniques.A nitinol stent may be suitable for aortic graft fixation, has characteristics similar to the Palmaz stent and has shape memory effect which may overcome the difficulties of introduction of wider diameter stents through narrow arteries.
