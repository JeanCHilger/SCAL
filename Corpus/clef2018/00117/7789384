Transoesophageal echocardiographic follow-up of patients with surgically treated aortic aneurysms. In the present study, biplane transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was scheduled as part of an aneurysm surveillance programme during routine ambulatory follow-up of 37 patients following aortic aneurysm surgery. Time from surgery ranged from 3-72 months. Twenty-two patients had had aortic dissection and 15 non-dissecting aneurysms. Nineteen patients received an interposition graft of the ascending aorta, 12 valved conduit and six an interposition graft of the descending thoracic aorta. TEE showed enlargement of the sinus of Valsalva > 45 mm in seven patients. Dilatation > 45 mm of one or more aortic segments was found in four patients. An intimal flap was present in all patients, with primary aortic dissection if the initial dissection extended beyond the replaced segment. This was the case in 17 of 22 patients with aortic dissection. One to four intimal tears were identified in 15 of these patients. In all patients with intimal tears, flow was detected by colour flow Doppler in the false lumen. Thrombus formation was nil or minimal in the false lumen in 12 patients. TEE significantly influenced further management in 14 of 37 patients (38%). More frequent follow-up was scheduled in eight patients. Aortic surgery was performed electively for the second or third time in six patients based on TEE findings. We conclude that after surgical repair of aortic aneurysm, the incidence of pathological findings by TEE is high. These may have significant influence on further patient management and emphasize the need for careful follow-up.
