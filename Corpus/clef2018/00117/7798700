Clinical results of selective cerebral perfusion during reconstruction of the transverse aortic arch. Selective cerebral perfusion (SPC) has become a reliable method for brain protection during reconstruction of the transverse aortic arch. However, arterial cannulation technique for the branches of the aortic arch varies among groups, and the necessity of perfusion for the left subclavian artery is controversial. To avoid atheroembolism to the brain and malperfusion of the vertebral arterial system, we carefully selected the arterial cannulation technique according to the result of preoperative ultrasonographic and angiographic evaluation of the branches of the aortic arch, and decided the necessity of perfusion for the left subclavian artery according to the dominance of the two vertebral arteries and the result of pressure monitoring of all three branches. In this report, we analyzed our clinical results of selective cerebral perfusion on 22 consecutive patients, which was performed between April 1992 and December 1993. There were 14 atherosclerotic aneurysms and 8 aortic dissections. The flow rate for SCP was controlled by a single blood pump separate from that for systemic perfusion, with the mean value being 13.1 ml/kg/min. Mean of minimum left superficial temporal arterial pressure was 51 mmHg, mean duration of SCP was 134 minutes, and mean of the lowest esophageal temperature was 17.9 degrees C. Blood pH was regulated with alpha-stat strategy. Arterial cannula for SCP was inserted directly into the vessels through a stab wound in most cases. In three of four patients in whom dissection extended to the branches, a balloon catheter was introduced through the lumen of the aortic arch.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
