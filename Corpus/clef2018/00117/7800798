Stent angioplasty of the intrarenal aorta and aortic bifurcation. Clinical and angiographical results of a prospective study. The study was carried out to evaluate clinical and technical success, early and late complications and patency rates after stent angioplasty of atherosclerotic stenoses and occlusions of the infrarenal abdominal aorta and aortic bifurcation.This was a prospective study in 20 consecutive patients treated by implantation of balloon-expandable stents. All patients were followed-up after 6 and 12 months and at yearly intervals thereafter by physical examination, Doppler sonography and angiography.Nineteen of 20 patients had clinical and technical success. In two patients clinically relevant complications occurred. During a mean observation time of 19 months (range 3-51 months) restenosis occurred in one stent after 15 months and was successfully treated by balloon angioplasty. Two patients became symptomatic again due to new atherosclerotic disease.Percutaneous stent angioplasty of the infrarenal aorta and aortic bifurcation yields high immediate and mid-term success rates with primary patency of 90% and secondary patency of 95%. These results are slightly better than those with balloon angioplasty, but the limited number of patients in our and others' studies does not yet justify general recommendations.
