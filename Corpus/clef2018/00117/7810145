Emergency management of ruptured/dissecting aortic aneurysm--diagnosis and therapeutic strategies. Between December 1991 and January 1994 fifteen patients with a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm and seven patients with a dissecting aortic aneurysm were treated in our emergency department. Dissection/rupture of an aortic aneurysm is still a dramatic event with poor outcome, whereby survival depends largely on early diagnosis. In most cases the diagnosis can be made with reasonable assurance by history taking and physical examination. The most frequent differential diagnoses are pulmonary embolism and myocardial infarction (thoracic aneurysms) and renal or biliary colic and lumbago (abdominal aneurysms). The largest delay in commencing therapy is caused by patients' hesitation to call the Emergency Medical Service. Chest X-ray, echocardiography and abdominal sonography are of high diagnostic value, computed tomography confirms the diagnosis in most cases. Our Emergency Department provides the facilities for rapid diagnosis and interdisciplinary preoperative management of dissecting/ruptured aortic aneurysms.
