Diagnosis of coronary artery dehiscence and pseudoaneurysm after modified Bentall operation by Doppler color flow imaging: a case report. This 48-year-old man presented with anterior chest and back pain in 1981. He was treated with replacement of the ascending aorta and aortic valve under a diagnosis of dissection of the ascending aorta with severe aortic regurgitation. He underwent modified Bentall reoperation for the dilation of the aortic root in 1991. Postoperative two-dimensional echocardiography was performed because of sustained atrial flutter. An echo-free space was detected between the aorta graft and aorta wrapping on the short-axis view. Doppler color flow imaging revealed blood flow from the left coronary artery graft into the echo-free space. This leakage was suspected to be the cause of the echo-free space. Transesophageal echocardiography was performed to conform this hypothesis, which revealed blood flow from the left coronary artery graft into the echo-free space in systole and flow into the left coronary artery graft from the echo-free space in diastole.
