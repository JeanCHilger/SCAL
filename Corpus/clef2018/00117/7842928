The diagnosis and surgical treatment of Leriches syndrome: an analysis of 16 cases. The authors report 16 cases of atherosclerotic obliteration of the terminal abdominal aorta seen in the period of 1987-1991. Early diagnosis can be made by using color doppler, and angiography and DSA are very important to determinate the clinical patterns and occlusive locations. A/B Index is also valuable in the diagnosis and treatment. Clinically, it should be differentiated from orthopedic, neurologic and urologic diseases, surgical procedure varies with occlusive location, clinical patterns, general status, and conditions of the affected blood vessels. Follow-up found that Y type aorto-femoral bypass get the best result with one-year unobstructed rate of 100% in all cases, and five-year cumulative unobstructed rate of 75%. The outcome of auxiliary-femoral bypass grafts were the least satisfactory, with the five-year cumulative unobstructed rate of only 34%. Comprehensive therapy should be adopted to improve the long-term cumulative unobstructed rate.
