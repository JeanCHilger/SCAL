Axillofemoral bypass graft in a spinal cord injured patient with impending gangrene. The axillofemoral bypass graft, an extra-anatomic graft, connects the axillary artery to the femoral artery and is used in the treatment of significant aortoiliac occlusive disease in poor-risk patients. A common indication for axillofemoral bypass is a "hostile abdomen" (postoperative adhesions, neoplasms or radiation). Less frequent indications are aortic mycotic aneurysm, infected aortobifemoral bypass graft, aortoduodenal fistula, inflammatory aneurysm and extensive retroperitoneal fibrosis. Spinal cord injured patients with peripheral arterial disease have two problems: 1) lack of premonitory symptoms (absence of claudication, paresthesias or rest pain) and 2) difficulty preventing pressure sores in the already poorly perfused limb. Indications for arterial reconstructive surgery are more drastic in this set of patients (impending gangrene and/or ischemic ulcers). Many spinal cord injured patients have sources of possible contamination (cystostomy and/or colostomy) which make intra-abdominal clean surgery impossible. We present a spinal cord injured patient with a permanent cystostomy and impending gangrene of the left foot. He underwent a left axillofemoral bypass graft and had a good postoperative course. We conclude that axillofemoral bypass graft is a good alternative for limb salvage in the spinal cord injured patient, especially when there is a source of possible contamination (colostomy and/or cystostomy) that would interfere with more common bypass grafting. The role of the noninvasive vascular laboratory for early detection of vascular disease is emphasized.
