The role of diagnositc ultrasound in the assessment of masses in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. The usefulness and advantages of diagnostic ultrasound (sonar) scanning as an aid in the investigation of soft-tissue masses, are illustrated in a number of patients with such masses in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. These illustrative cases show that sonar scanning can reveal the size, shape, anatomical relations, and consistency of intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal masses. Sonar scanning is particularly valuable in differentiating cystic from solid masses. Furthermore, clinically unsuspected masses can be detected. Sonar scanning is harmless, relatively quick, non-invasive and causes no pain or discomfort. These factors are of particular importance in postoperative and acutely ill patients.
