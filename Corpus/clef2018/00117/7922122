Molecular basis for sequence selective DNA alkylation by (+)- and ent-(-)-CC-1065 and related agents: alkylation site models that accommodate the offset AT-rich adenine N3 alkylation selectivity. A detailed evaluation of the DNA alkylation selectivity of (+)-CC-1065, ent-(-)-CC-1065 and a series of aborted and extended analogs possessing the CPI alkylation subunit is detailed and the refinement of a model that accommodates the offset AT-rich adenine N3 alkylation selectivity of the enantiomeric agents is presented. The natural enantiomers bind in the minor groove in the 3'-->5' direction starting from the adenine N3 alkylation site across a 2 base (N-BOC-CPI i.e. 5'-AA), 3.5 base (CPI-CDPI1/CPI-PDE-I1
