Doppler flow measurement in coronary artery bypass grafts and early postoperative clinical outcome. The present investigation attempts to correlate flow measurements made intraoperatively in coronary bypass grafts with clinical outcome. A total of 352 consecutive patients undergoing isolated coronary artery surgery underwent hemodynamic assessment of their bypass grafts (328 internal thoracic artery and 582 saphenous vein grafts) at the end of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) by using a 8 MHz pulsed Doppler ultrasound flowmeter. The total patient population was divided into three groups of distinct outcome (A: normal, 228 patients B: complicated, 106 patients
