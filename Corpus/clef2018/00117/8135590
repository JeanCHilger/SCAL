The transcatheter closure of patent ductus arteriosus. The initial experience. Percutaneous closure of the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) has been recently reported to be an effective alternative in the treatment of patients with ductal shunting. We report the initial experience and results during follow-up of percutaneous ductal occlusion with the Rashkind occluder (USCI) in six patients with isolated PDA. Ages ranged from 3 to 23 years. Diagnosis was corroborated with two dimensional and Doppler echocardiography in all patients. During cardiac catheterization systolic pulmonary artery pressure oscillated between 22 and 64 mmHg and Qp/Qs ratio between 1.3 and 4.1. In two patients prosthesis of 12 mm were used and in the remaining prosthesis of 17 mm. Only one patient demonstrated total occlusion during immediate control aortography, the other patients presented central residual shunting over the occluder. In the three patients occlusion with balloon-catheter was added to the procedure, resulting in total occlusion in two and significant reduction of the shunt magnitude in one. Two technical problems were resolved satisfactorily. None of the cases presented device embolization. Mean follow-up was 23.8 months with control echocardiograms at 24 hours, 1, 4, 12 and 24 months. In all patients immediate reduction of the left atrial dimension was demonstrated. Three patients presented residual shunts in the first 24 hours. In two of them total occlusion had occurred after one month and the other patient persisted with a small residual shunt until one year after the procedure. In conclusion, in this small study group good results were obtained with percutaneous ductal closure.
