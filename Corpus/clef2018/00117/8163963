The use of ultrasonography to scan the abdomen of patients presenting for routine physical examinations. Ultrasonography has become an increasingly important diagnostic tool, producing high-quality images at a low cost. However, except in obstetrics, ultrasonography has not been used for screening purposes in asymptomatic persons.This prospective study included 189 patients on whom an abdominal ultrasound scan was performed by a family physician as part of a routine physical examination. During the 2-year follow-up period, the screening was evaluated by determining whether the ultrasound findings contributed to the patient's health care management.Forty-two of the patients (22%) were found to have previously undiagnosed conditions. The most common findings were gallstones, urinary retention, and renal cysts. Six patients (3%) received treatment for the condition detected by the screening, but three of these patients received treatment only after they developed symptoms during the 2-year follow-up period. One patient developed symptoms for gallstones that may have been missed by the screening ultrasound. The internal and external reliability rates for the screening examination were 96% and 82%, respectively.Ultrasound findings altered the treatment plan for 3% of the screened patients but was the sole factor leading to treatment in only 1.6%. Abdominal ultrasound can be performed accurately and at a reasonable cost by generalist physicians. Patient acceptance was high, and many reported feeling reassured by the ultrasound screening.
