Removal of indwelling ureteral catheters with ultrasound guidance. Indwelling ureteral catheters are commonly used to splint injured ureters or to relieve obstruction. This study evaluated the possibility of using ultrasound guidance in the removal of internal ureteral catheters in women. During the 12-month period from August 1990 to August 1991, patients who desired the removal of indwelling ureteral catheters were sent to the outpatient ultrasound division instead of the urology clinic. They were instructed to come with a full bladder, or a saline infusion was required. Abdominal or vaginal ultrasound was first performed to locate the ureteral catheter. Blunt-tipped alligator forceps were used to remove the catheters under direct, real-time ultrasound guidance. A total of six catheters was removed from five patients. The average removal time was 12 +/- 4 (SD) minutes, with good patient acceptance. Further studies are required to establish the safety and efficacy of the procedure.
