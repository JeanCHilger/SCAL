Tricuspid regurgitation following mitral valve replacement: an echocardiographic study. The development of late tricuspid regurgitation following mitral valve replacement is accompanied by a severe reduction in exercise capacity and a poor functional outcome. In this study, we compared the clinical and echocardiographic characteristics of two matched groups with (n = 13) and without (n = 13) clinically significant tricuspid regurgitation. The preoperative pulmonary artery pressures and symptom durations were similar, but tricuspid regurgitation at palpation was detected only in patients who later developed severe tricuspid regurgitation (5/13 vs. 0/13 p < 0.02). None of the patients had echocardiographic evidence of rheumatic tricuspid valve disease at the time of the study, but the tricuspid annular diameter (3.7 +/- 0.5 cm vs. 3.2 +/- 0.4 cm
