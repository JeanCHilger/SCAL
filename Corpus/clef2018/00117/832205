Angiography: an essential diagnostic aid in asymptomatic aortic aneurysm? Aortography is a highly desirable diagnostic procedure for evaluating clinically diagnosed abdominal aortic aneurysm. In a retrospective study of 83 patients with such aneurysms, routine angiographic investigation changed the course of management in 17. The morbidity associated with angiography in the investigation of abdominal aortic aneurysm has been minimal. In this situation angiography provides more information than ultrasonography and therefore should be used routinely.
