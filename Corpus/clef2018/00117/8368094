Echo Doppler in abdominal aortic dissection. The authors present a case of abdominal aorta dissection--type B. The diagnosis was made by Doppler ultrasound and computerized tomography (CT). The use of Doppler ultrasound in the diagnosis and assessment of abdominal aorta dissection and visceral arterial involvement is discussed. Doppler ultrasound is also a useful imaging technique in follow-up evaluation if conservative treatment is employed.
