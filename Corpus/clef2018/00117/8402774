Role of transesophageal echocardiography in dissection of the aorta and evaluation of degenerative aortic disease. The combination of different ultrasound techniques such as transthoracic, suprasternal, subcostal, and TEE has a high sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of aortic dissection. Limitations of this combined ultrasound technique are related to the visualization of the ascending part of the aortic arch, which, because of the interposition of the trachea, cannot be visualized completely. The beginning or end of a dissection in this part of the aorta may be misinterpreted. However, false-negative results are rare. False-positive results due to artifacts resulting from reverberations in an ectatic ascending aorta must be taken into account. The most important diagnostic goals in acute or chronic aortic dissection are (1) confirmation of the diagnosis by visualization of the intimal membrane (2) the differentiation of true and false lumen, depending on visualization of spontaneous echocardiographic contrast, thrombus formation, slow or reduced reversed flow, systolic diameter reduction, and signs of entry jet into the false lumen
