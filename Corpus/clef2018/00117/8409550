Echocardiography in the diagnosis of thoracic aortic pathology. Transthoracic two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography has been well established as a useful technique for evaluating many pathologic processes affecting the thoracic aorta. However, the distance of the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta from the chest wall and the interposition of highly attenuating lung and highly reflective mediastinal structures between the transducer and the aorta present unavoidable limitations. Transesophageal echocardiography is a relatively new technology that overcomes many of the inherent limitations with transthoracic imaging. Complete echocardiographic evaluation of the entire thoracic aorta can now be achieved in nearly all patients. This article will review the continually expanding role of echocardiography in the evaluation of thoracic aortic pathology, including the dramatic impact of transesophageal imaging on the diagnosis of life-threatening disorders such as aortic dissection.
