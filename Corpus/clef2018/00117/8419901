Sequential invasions of pancreatic pseudocysts in pancreatic tail, hepatic left lobe, caudate lobe, and spleen. A 66-year-old male patient without a history of risk factors for pancreatitis suffered from pancreatitis and developed pseudocyst. During the course of treatment and follow-up, the pseudocyst was found to have migrated through the pancreatic tail, left hepatic lobe, caudate lobe, and spleen on abdominal sonography and computed tomography scan. Finally, emergent laparotomy was done for splenic abscess and removal of infected pseudocyst in the spleen and lesser sac of the abdomen. The patient made a full recovery after operation.
