Localized dissection of the abdominal aorta. Diagnosis and surgical treatment. Abdominal aortic dissection is a rare pathology. As far as we are concerned, only 59 cases have been reported in the English literature. In the last two years, two cases were treated at our Institution. Both were males, over 70 years of age. They were evaluated with ultrasonography, angiography (1 case) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging which showed localised dissection of the abdominal aorta with aneurysmal dilatation. They underwent surgical treatment with good results. At 1 and 2 years from operation both patients are alive and well. A postoperative ultrasonography didn't show any residual dissection.
