Porcine stentless aortic valve in re-replacements and acute aortic valve endocarditis. Between June 1990 and June 1993, 135 patients received a porcine stentless aortic valve (PSAV) at our institution. In this group, there were 33 patients in whom the stentless valve was used to replace a previously inserted malfunctioning aortic valve prosthesis (n = 19) or to treat acute aortic valve endocarditis (n = 14, five native, nine prosthetic endocarditis).

Two patients died after hospital discharge one suffered sudden death following a pacemaker failure four month after surgery and the other died due to Candida albicans sepsis after a prolonged antibiotic treatment. There were two reoperations
