Bilaterial renal artery atherosclerosis--the results of surgical treatment. To assess the outcome of surgical treatment for severe bilateral renal artery stenosis.Non-randomised, prospective, consecutive series.Twenty-five patients undergoing surgical reconstruction of whom 14 required aortic replacement (aneurysm, n = 7, severe claudication, n = 7). In 22 patients, the principle aim of treatment was preservation or salvage of renal function whilst three patients had intractable hypertension.Serum creatinine and blood pressure were measured at the most recent follow-up (minimum 6 months, median 17 months) and compared to preoperative values.Renal function (serum creatinine) improved or stabilised in 16 of 18 patients in whom it was elevated preoperatively (>140 mumol/l 3 patients on dialysis) whilst one patient with early graft occlusion subsequently required long term dialysis. Blood pressure control was also improved in 14 patients. There were four postoperative deaths (16%) and five patients required re-exploration for postoperative anuria (3) or bleeding (2).Surgical revascularisation preserves renal function and may improve blood pressure control in patients with advanced multi-system atherosclerosis. The operative morbidity and mortality is significant although historical data suggests that this is less than for similar patients treated medically.
