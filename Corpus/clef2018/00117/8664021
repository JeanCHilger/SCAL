Hemodynamics of various designs of 19 mm pericardial aortic valve bioprosthesis. The hemodynamics of five designs of 19 mm pericardial aortic valve bioprostheses were examined in 47 resting patients by Doppler echocardiography. The salient differences among the five designs are that valve leaflets are mounted inside the support frame in one (the Carpentier-Edwards valve, evaluated in 4 patients) and outside the frame in the other four (the Ionescu-Shiley (16 patients), Mitroflow (4), Bioflo (8) and Labcor-Santiago (15)) and that two models have either total (Bioflo) or partial (Labcor-Santiago) protective pericardial sheaths on the stent, while the other three do not. The hemodynamic parameters determined included transvalvular pressure drop, valve area, left ventricular outflow tract diameter, subvalvular/valvular velocity ratio and subvalvular/valvular velocity-time integral ratio. There were no significant differences among the various valves as regards left ventricular outflow tract diameter, subvalvular/valvular velocity ratio or subvalvular/valvular velocity-time integral ratio. Negative correlation between left ventricular outflow tract diameter and subvalvular velocity (r = -0.66, P < 0.001) confirmed the need to correct for prevalvular velocities when using the Bernouilli equation to calculate the pressure drop across small pericardial aortic valve bioprostheses. The Bioflo design caused significantly greater pressure drops (peak 38.3 +/- 8.3 mmHg, mean 24.6 +/- 4.8 mmHg) and smaller areas (0.82 +/- 0.17 cm2) than the Ionescu-Shiley (20.3 +/- 5.6 and 11.7 +/- 3.8 mmHg, 1.19 +/- 5.3 and 10.1 +/- 3.1 mmHg, 1.27 +/- 0.12 cm2) valves.
