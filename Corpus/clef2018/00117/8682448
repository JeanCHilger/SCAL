Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis: a complication of metallic biliary stent placement. We present a case of 70-year-old female patient who was admitted due to progressive jaundice. Our clinical impression of cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumor), was confirmed by ultrasound, abdominal CT scan, and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography. Two self-expanding metallic stents were placed in both intrahepatic ducts through a single transhepatic tract. After successful biliary stenting, the jaundice subsided and she was discharged as improved. However, progressive right upper quadrant pain was noted a few days after discharge and persisted for about 5 months, thus the was readmitted. During admission, she was febrile, exhibiting leukocytosis, with clinical signs of impending septic shock. Gallbladder empyema with hilar cholangiocarcinoma were diagnosed. Percutaneous transhepatic cholecystotomy and drainage (PTCCD) was done to alleviate the symptoms and cholecystectomy was performed thereafter. Pathologic report was compatible with xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis. Post-operative recovery was fair at follow-up examination.
