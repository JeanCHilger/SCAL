Long-term follow up of abdominal aortic aneurysm complicating Kawasaki disease: comparison of the effectiveness of different imaging methods. A 2 month old boy with Kawasaki disease developed the rare complication of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). He was followed up over 7 years by ultrasonography (2D-ECHO) with and without Doppler flow evaluation, angiography and computed tomography. Calcification was noted 33 months after the onset of the disease but the aneurysm did not decrease in size. 2D-ECHO was adequate for evaluating the size of an aneurysm, but did not show thrombus formation or calcification. Doppler flow studies did not show abnormally high blood flow velocities either at the inflow or outlet of aneurysms, which are indicative of stenosis. On the other hand an abdominal aortogram provided information regarding the luminal shape and abnormalities in flow pattern suggestive of thrombus formation. Fluoroscopy cannot demonstrate calcification in the early stages. Computed tomography (CT) was the imaging method of choice for the evaluation of obstructive or calcific changes an organizing thrombus was clearly demonstrated and early detection of calcification was possible.
