Aortic pressure pain: clinical significance. Any relationship to the irritable bowel syndrome? Pressure pain over the abdominal aorta is a clinical sign of undetermined significance. Ultrasonographic criteria were used to define and further evaluate this variety of epigastric tenderness. The incidence of aortic pressure pain, aortic characteristics, and gastrointestinal symptoms were scored in 250 consecutive patients. The incidence was approximately 7%. All the patients with aortic pressure pain had gastrointestinal symptoms, with a significantly higher mean symptom score. The occurrence of pressure pain was independent of any of the examined aortic characteristics, age, or body mass index. We further compared the incidence of aortic pressure pain between 25 patients with irritable bowel syndrome and 25 patients without apparent functional gastrointestinal disease. It was present in approximately 50% of the patients with irritable bowel syndrome. We found pressure pain over the abdominal aorta to be associated with significant gastrointestinal discomfort. A causal relationship is possible but not proven. Aortic pressure pain can be provoked in a significant subgroup of patients with the irritable bowel syndrome.
