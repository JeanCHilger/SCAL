Review of techniques used to image aortic dissection. This article describes the imaging of aortic dissection from the perspective of a multidisciplinary imaging team. The relative merits of radiography, aortography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound and nuclear medicine are described. Each technique has unique advantages for initial diagnosis, confirmation and follow-up. In recent years, ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging have seen increased use for diagnosis of the condition.
