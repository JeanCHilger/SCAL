The 20 mm Medtronic Hall prosthesis in the small aortic root. The choice of prosthesis becomes crucial in the narrow aortic annulus. The 20 mm Medtronic Hall valve has a reduced sewing ring that fits in an annulus where only a 19 mm valve would fit. This study assesses the hemodynamic performance of this prosthesis at rest and at exercise, and compares it with two 19 mm mechanical prostheses.Forty-two patients were studied by Doppler echocardiography, a mean of 34 months following surgery. Twenty-six had a 19 mm prosthesis implanted (12 standard St. Jude Medical and 14 Monostrut valves) and 16 had a 20 mm Medtronic Hall. Parameters studied were peak velocity and transvalvular gradient, both at rest and at exercise, effective orifice area and valve index.No differences were found between the two 19 mm valves, but when compared with the Medtronic Hall valve at rest, this valve showed significantly lower peak velocity and gradient (2.9 vs. 3.3 m/sec, p < 0.01, and 17 vs. 23 mmHg, p < 0.003, respectively) and higher effective orifice area and valve index (1.3 vs. 1.0 cm2, p < 0.01 and 0.81 vs. 0.62 cm2, p < 0.006, respectively). There were also significant differences under exercise.The 20 mm Medtronic Hall prosthesis shows a significantly better hemodynamic performance, both at rest and under exercise, than other, 19 mm mechanical prostheses and represents a superior choice in valve replacement with a small aortic root.
