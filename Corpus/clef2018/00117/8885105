Unruptured congenital aneurysm of the right sinus of Valsalva. Dissecting into the interventricular septum. We report the case of a congenital aneurysm of the right sinus of Valsalva dissecting into the interventricular septum in a 21-year-old man. This condition was diagnosed by echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging. In particular, transthoracic and transesophageal color-coded Doppler echocardiography showed that there was no communication between the aneurysm and the surrounding heart chambers. The findings were confirmed by angiography. Heart enlargement and other symptoms and signs of heart failure indicated surgical repair of the lesion. Early postoperative dehiscence of the sutured orifice was accurately diagnosed with Doppler echocardiography and angiography. Reintervention was successful in filling and sealing the septal cavity. This case confirms the reported difficulties in the surgical correction of aneurysms of sinus of Valsalva lying within the interventricular septum.
