Abdominal sonography in asymptomatic executives: prevalence of pathologic findings, potential benefits, and problems. Abdominal ultrasonography was performed on 1000 asymptomatic executives over a period of 6 months as part of a comprehensive health examination. The use of ultrasonography in these persons was evaluated with regard to the prevalence and variety of pathologic conditions detected as well as potential benefits, risks, and use as a screening tool. Significant sonographic diagnoses included renal cell carcinoma in four patients (0.4%) and abdominal aortic aneurysm in four patients (0.4%). Abdominal sonography performed on 7925 asymptomatic executives over a subsequent 2 1/2 year period led to detection of 23 (0.3%) additional renal cell carcinomas. The prevalence of renal cell carcinoma in this population is substantially greater than that of the general population. Abdominal sonography facilitates detection of occult renal neoplasms and aortic aneurysms. The cost effectiveness and potential use of sonography as a screening tool remains to be determined, however, given the relatively low overall prevalence of these pathologic conditions.
