The echo Doppler study of mitral and aortic prostheses function. Doppler echography is now the most accurate noninvasive method for studying valvular prostheses, but the values considered to prove a normal function are still controversial. We studied by echo Doppler 95 valvular mechanical (M) and biological (B) prostheses, in mitral (Mi) and aortic (Ao) position in patients without clinical signs of prosthetic dysfunction. The data obtained for Ao prostheses (maximal transprosthetic gradient (MxG): M-20.47 mmHg, B-7.95 mmHg mean transprosthetic gradient (MG): M-7.98 mmHg, B-3.9 mmHg) are in agreement or even better than literature data. For Mi prostheses the prosthetic area (PA) and pressure half time (PHT) values are in normal limits but the MG (M-5.087 mmHg, B-5.9 mmHg) is slightly superior to the data reported in the literature. Proving the value of echo Doppler for the study of valvular prostheses our results suggest to adopt larger limits of normality for mitral prostheses. They also sustain the necessity of a first Doppler examination before the patient is discharged from the hospital after valvular replacement.
