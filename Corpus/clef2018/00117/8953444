Hemodynamic evaluation of 23 mm Pericarbon and 23 mm Hancock II bioprostheses in the aortic position at mid-term follow up. Pericardial xenografts were introduced for clinical use following evidence of their good hemodynamic characteristics in laboratory tests however, their efficiency in comparison with porcine valves has not been fully assessed. Pericarbon, a new type of pericardial bioprosthesis, has been recently developed in order to provide better hemodynamic performances and longer durability than such bioprostheses currently in use.Fifteen patients operated on for aortic valve replacement with a 23 mm Pericarbon and a sex- and age-matched group operated on with a 23 mm Hancock II bioprosthesis were submitted to echocardiographic and Doppler examinations in order to compare the hemodynamic performance of the two devices.Peak transvalvular gradients for Pericarbon and Hancock II bioprostheses (38.9 +/- 13.0 vs. 33.9 +/- 13.0 mmHg p = 0.294) and mean transvalvular gradients (24.7 +/- 7.6 vs. 20.8 +/- 9.9 mmHg, p = 0.24) showed no significant difference. However, the indexed effective prosthetic dynamic area was significantly larger for the Hancock II device (0.73 +/- 0.14 vs. 0.62 +/- 0.13 cm2When installed as 23 mm pericardial bioprostheses, the Pericarbon device appears not to demonstrate superior hemodynamic performance to that of the Hancock II however, additional studies are needed to provide a definitive conclusion.
