Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. In the years 1990-1994, 43 patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (RAAA) were operated on at the Department of Vascular Surgery of the Na Homolce Hospital in Prague. Men outnumbered women, average patient age was 70 years. The mean delay between onset of symptoms and hospital admission counted 27 hrs. Prior to transportation, one half to two thirds of patients went through at least two types of confirmative evaluation (CAT, ultrasound, angiography) and/or were referred via two or more hospital departments. In two thirds of patients profound shock with oligoanuria and hypotension were found. Anuria/hypotension proved to occur in a significantly lower rate in later survivors compared to later dead (11.8% vs. 23.5%: p < 0.05). Persistent hypotension during surgery together with eventual resuscitation as well as free blood found within the abdominal cavity showed up as further ominous factors. Renal failure was the leading postoperative complication (51.2%) with 27.9% of patients requiring hemodialysis after repair. Sepsis (25.6%), pneumonia (20.9%) and hemorrhage (13.9%) followed. Twenty-six patients were lost (60.5%) either within the first hours and days after surgery because of irreversible hemorrhagic shock or between the second and fourth week due to the sequels of organ failure and sepsis. In our cohort, regardless of age, sex, concomitant disease or the type of surgery, the patient's status on admission determined his/her further destiny. Urgent transfer to a specialized center going hand in hand with prompt and effective reanimation steps are the patient's only hope for survival.
