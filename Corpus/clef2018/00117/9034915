Changing aneurysmal morphology after endovascular grafting: relation to leakage or persistent perfusion. To relate changing abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) morphology after endovascular grafting to the presence of leakage, collateral perfusion, and other factors.Thirty-five patients who underwent successful AAA endovascular grafting were evaluated. Self-expanding Z-stents and Dacron grafts were applied in bifurcated and aortomonoiliac systems. Postoperative diameter changes were calculated from repeated spiral computed tomographic scans, angiograms, and ultrasonic phase-locked echo-tracking scans during a median 6-month follow-up (interquartile range [IQR] 3 to 12).At 12 months, the diameters of completely excluded aneurysms had decreased 6 mm (IQR 2 to 11 p = 0.006). The proximal graft-anchoring stents had dilated 2 mm (IQR 0.5 to 3.3The diameters of endovascularly excluded AAAs decrease, except in cases of leakage or perfusion. Careful follow-up of patients with aortic endografts is necessary.
