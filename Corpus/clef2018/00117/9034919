Intravascular ultrasound: the ultimate tool for abdominal aortic aneurysm assessment and endovascular graft delivery. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging is a relatively new, rapidly evolving technology that enables precise catheter-based assessment of the dimensions and morphology of vascular structures and lesions. In extensive preclinical laboratory developmental studies and in clinical cases of endograft deployment for treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms, we have found IVUS invaluable for determining key parameters of aortic morphology before and during interventions and for assessing the accuracy of deployment after device placement. By combining the IVUS data with information obtained from angiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography (axial and three-dimensional reconstructions), we have been able to size devices and choose optimal fixation sites to prevent endoleaks and maintain luminal patency acutely and in the long term.
