Aortic coarctation--long-term follow-up in adults. Surgical repair of coarctation of the aorta has been performed since 1945. Although surgical techniques have improved, problems such as restenosis and aneurysm at the operation site or hypertensive cardiovascular disease, still remain. To evaluate the long-term results after surgical repair of coarctation, 41 patients, 25 male and 16 female patients (mean age: 28 +/- 11 years, range 14-57 years), were studied 16 +/- 8 years after surgery (range 3-44 years). Mean age at surgery was 12 +/- 9 years (range 0.5-35 years). In 24 patients resection and end-to-end anastomosis had been performed, patch graft aortoplasty in nine patients, tube interposition graft in seven patients and one patient had undergone the subclavian flap technique. All patients were assessed by exact physical examination, the resting arm-to-leg systolic pressure gradient was measured by Doppler sonography, a bicycle exercise test and an echocardiogram were performed. Twenty-one patients reported postoperative symptoms such as dizziness (n = 12), headache (n = 3), cold legs (n = 10) and/or dyspnea (n = 8). In two patients the resting arm-to-leg pressure gradient was greater than 30 mm Hg, in two patients it was greater than 20 mm Hg. Gradient calculated by Doppler echocardiography ranged from 0 to 80 mm Hg (21 +/- 17 mm Hg) and showed poor correlation with the arm-to-leg pressure difference. The mean functional capacity was 89 +/- 18% (range 42-110%). In 18 patients exercise-induced hypertension was found, while in only eight patients arterial hypertension had already been known. To evaluate the morphology of the aorta MRI was performed in 28 patients. No aneurysm was found. In five patients a minimal lumen diameter as small as 9-11 mm was measured. Patients were divided into two groups according to their age at operation, group I: < 9 years (n = 19) and group II: > 9 years (n = 22). Resting blood pressure was significantly higher in group II (135 +/- 27 mm Hg vs 114 +/- 20 mm Hg, p < 0.009), anti-hypertensive medication (43% vs 11%, p < 0.04) and symptoms were more frequent in these patients (15/22 vs 6/19, p < 0.04). However at time of follow-up examination the age of patients of group II was significantly higher (33 +/- 12 vs 22 +/- 5 years, p < 0.0005). Between these two groups there was no difference in follow-up time and results of echocardiography or stress test. In conclusion, despite good long-term results after surgical repair of coarctation of the aorta, patients should be followed on a regular basis primarily in order to recognize systemic hypertension as early as possible and to improve the long-term outcome in these patients by antihypertensive treatment.
