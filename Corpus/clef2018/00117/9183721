Doppler echocardiographic study of three different mechanical valves in the aortic position: the use of external nominal diameter indexed to body surface area. Previous studies have demonstrated the benefit of indexing body surface area (BSA) with ventriculo-arterial orifice diameters (or calculated effective surface dynamics) and with nominal external diameters of valves in order to study hemodynamic profiles in vivo or determine the clinical influence of this parameter. This study analyzes the relationship between BSA and nominal external diameter of mechanical valves implanted in the aortic position. It also evaluates the potential interest of using these diameters indexed to BSA in an echo-Doppler study of valves.During 1994, a prospective echo-Doppler study of three models of mechanical valves in the aortic position was carried out.The echo-Doppler parameters of the aortic St. Jude Medical, Sorin Bicarbon and Dideco Monostrut prostheses have been studied with regard to nominal external diameters and were found identical to published data. There were no significant differences in these parameters between the three valves. In 128 patients, prosthetic external diameters were evenly distributed heterogeneously with regard to BSA. Indexing of nominal external diameter with BSA appeared a more reliable reference to study different echo-Doppler parameters, minimizing the effect of cardiac output.The in vivo echo-Doppler determination at rest of valve hemodynamic profiles should be carried out with reference to the nominal external diameter indexed to the BSA.
