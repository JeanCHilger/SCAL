Value of concomitant sympathectomy in aortoiliac reconstruction. Results of a prospective, randomized study. The efficacy of concomitant lumbar sympathectomy in improving results of aortoiliac reconstruction was assessed by a prospective, randomized study of 51 patients undergoing operation for occlusive or aneurysmal disease. Sympathectomy was performed on 50 limbs, while 52 extremities served as controls. Sympathectomy resulted in a significant reduction in foot vascular resistance determined by plethysmography. However, the procedure had no effect on leg circulation, assessed by ankle/arm pressure indices determined by Doppler ultrasound. In the sympathectomy group, there were three early postoperative amputations for ischemia, despite patent grafts. In the control group, there was one late graft occlusion, caused by progressive atherosclerotic disease. Although sympathectomy may improve pedal circulation, the procedure does not appear to improve the results of aortoiliac reconstruction.
