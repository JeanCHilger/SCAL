Prosthetic endocarditis and splenic abscess caused by Clostridium clostridiformis. We report the first case of Clostridium clostridiformis endocarditis in a 71 year old man with an aortic prosthetic valve. He was febrile with left upper quadrant pain and left lower lobe infiltrate in chest X ray. The diagnosis was made by gram-positive bacilli grown from three blood cultures. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiogram showed a paraaortic abscess. A computed tomographic scan of the abdomen revealed a large splenic abscess. He received penicillin G 4 million units every 4 hours intravenously. A successful percutaneous drainage guided computed tomographic scan was performed. The patient remained febrile and a new computed tomographic scan of the abdomen revealed residual splenic abscess. A splenectomy was performed. The patient defervesced on the second day of surgery and remained afebrile during the remainder of his hospitalization. He has returned for medical follow-up and two years later the patient is asymptomatic.
