Postoperative color flow duplex scanning in aortic endografting. To report the feasibility and sensitivity of duplex sonography compared to computed tomography (CT) for aortic endograft follow-up surveillance.In a 26-month period, 113 aortic aneurysm patients received 79 tube and 34 bifurcated stent-grafts. Follow-up used contrast-enhanced CT scanning and duplex sonography with an intravenous ultrasound contrast agent (Levovist).Eleven patients (9.7%) were converted to open repair 1 died from hemorrhagic shock secondary to retroperitoneal hematoma. The mean follow-up time was 7.2 months (range 1 to 24), during which 5 patients died of unrelated causes. Sixteen primary (within 30 days) and 5 secondary endoleaks were detected by duplex after tube graft implantation. Among 5 endoleaks due to retrograde side-branch perfusion, 3 were detected only with contrast-enhanced duplex scanning. Iliac artery occlusion was also documented using duplexDuplex sonography could be a valuable, reliable, and economical surveillance tool for endovascular aortic reconstructions. The adjunctive use of an intravenous ultrasound contrast agent increased the sensitivity for detecting endoleak to a level comparable to contrast-enhanced CT scanning. However, stent fractures may not be seen on ultrasound, and bowel gas can interfere with obtaining an adequate image.
