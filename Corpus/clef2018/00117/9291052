Ultrasound imaging during endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair using the Stentor bifurcated endograft. To evaluate different ultrasound modalities during implantation and follow-up of endovascular grafts for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) exclusion.Between February 1995 and May 1996, 18 patients (14 men aged 49 to 80 years, mean 67) were treated with endovascular intervention for infrarenal AAA. Seventeen patients received Mialhe Stentor bifurcated grafts, while one patient was treated with a straight graft for pseudoaneurysm. During and after the implantation, 3.25- and 5-MHz annular array ultrasound probes were used for transabdominal visualization of the endograft. Intravascular ultrasound was applied in combination with angiography for postoperative control.Intraprocedurally, transabdominal two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound successfully monitored guidewire passage from the groin into the main part of the bifurcated endograft for implantation of the second limb. All implantation procedures were technically successful, but four endoleaks were identified intraprocedurally by 2D ultrasound and angiography. One healed spontaneously, two were treated with endovascular techniques at 1 and 4 months, and the last leak was scheduled for repair when the patient died of probable myocardial infarction at 2 months. During follow-up, 2D ultrasound successfully visualized all the endografts no endoleaks were found in up to 18 months of surveillance.Transabdominal ultrasound imaging could be valuable in bifurcated endograft deployment both for guiding guidewire insertion and for controlling wire position before the second graft limb is connected to the main graft. Provided that satisfactory visualization of the entire endograft can be obtained, ultrasound examination may possibly replace arteriography and computed tomographic scanning as a follow-up investigation.
