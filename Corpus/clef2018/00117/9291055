Endoluminal repair of large abdominal aortic aneurysms using PTFE: a feasibility study. To investigate the feasibility of using predilated thin-wall polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) secured by extra-large Palmaz stents for endoluminal repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA).Thirty-two patients (26 males aged 69 to 83 years) from three centers (two in Europe, one in Australia) were selected for endoluminal stent-grafting using predilated B-mm PTFE graft material fitted with extra-large Palmaz stents at the terminal ends. Aortoaortic tube grafts were implanted in 12 patients, while the remainder received aortomonoiliac endografts and femorofemoral bypass. Follow-up at 5 days and then biannually was by contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or duplex scanning.There were 13 conversions to open surgery these patients died within 30 days. Nineteen patients were discharged with functioning endografts within 5 days of treatment. Of these, two have had their grafts removed owing to infection in one and distal stent migration in the other. Two endoleaks have been detected in follow-upThese results represent the learning curves of three separate centers. Technical failure and complications were more common early in the study. Advantages of the technique include relative low cost and the ability to tailor the stent-graft to the individual aneurysm.
