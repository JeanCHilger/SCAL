Urography in preoperative evaluation of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Ultrasound is a commonly used and accurate method to diagnose abdominal aortic aneurysms. A case of abdominal aortic aneurysm, diagnosed by ultrasound, which at surgery was found to have an overlying horseshoe kidney with multiple renal vessels is reported. The clot surrounding the aneurysm most likely prevented demonstration of the isthmus of the horseshoe kidney by echography. Since preservation of renal blood supply is crucial, urography should routinely be performed prior to surgery to discover such anomalies.
