Magnetic resonance angiography and colour-Doppler sonography in the evaluation of abdominal aortic aneurysms. This prospective study was aimed at comparing the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) with colour-Doppler ultrasonography (colour-Doppler US) in the assessment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). Twenty patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms underwent MRA, colour-Doppler US, digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and CT. The MRA technique and colour-Doppler findings were compared with DSA as well as surgical and pathological findings, which were considered as the gold standard. In 6 patients who refused surgery, CT and DSA were considered as the gold standard. The MRA technique always correctly assessed the size and site of the aneurysms, the involvement of the renal and common iliac arteries, the course of the left renal vein, the thrombotic component and the calcifications. Colour-Doppler US always correctly assessed the size and site of the aneurysms, the thrombotic component and calcifications and the involvement of the iliac arteries. Our preliminary results suggest that MRA together with colour-Doppler US represents a valid alternative to invasive imaging in the assessment of AAA.
