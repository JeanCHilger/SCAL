Stent grafting for abdominal aortic aneurysms in Finland--a feasibility study. Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) is a feasible procedure in selected patients. In order to assess how many AAAs are suitable for such a procedure, a survey has been conducted in Helsinki, Kuopio, and Tampere University Hospitals.AAAs having a maximum diameter of 45 mm or more at ultrasonography were included for further evaluation and assessment by angiography and/or spiral CT angiography to determine the length and width of infrarenal aneurysmal neck as well as the dimensions of the distal abdominal aorta and iliac arteries.Among a total of 75 patients with AAA examined in three centres, ultrasonography overestimated the size of the aneurysm in 12 cases that were demonstrated by angiography and CT to have a diameter of less than 45 mm. Among those patients with larger aneurysms, 17 (27%) were suitable for endovascular repair. Stent grafting has been performed in 10 patients until May, 1997. Perigraft leakage occurred in one patient who required the insertion of an additional collar stent graft.Large numbers of suitable patients are not easy to find but, by performing joint screening in Finland, epidemiological data on suitable aneurysms and improving co-operation between centres can be achieved. Therefore, it would be wise to centralise endovascular repair of AAA.
