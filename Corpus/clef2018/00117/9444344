Evaluation of an instructional model for emergency ultrasonography. To evaluate a 4-hour ultrasonography course in the setting of an emergency medicine (EM) training program.EM residents and faculty at a large urban center were provided a 4-hour emergency ultrasonography course. Then, during an 18-month period, a nonconsecutive sample of ultrasonographic examinations were videotaped and later reviewed. The interpretations of the emergency, physician examinations were compared with the following reference standards: 1) an official ultrasound performed and interpreted by the departments of radiology or cardiology 2) an operative reportOf 258 examinations reviewed, 28 (11%) of these were excluded because the cardiologist or radiologist reviewing the videotape determined them to be "technically limited" studies. Of the remaining 230 examinations, there were: 127 gallbladder studies [disease prevalence = 0.58 sensitivity = 0.89This 4-hour ultrasonography course has potential to serve as a foundation for an instructional model for ultrasonography training in the setting of an EM residency program.
