Subisthmic aortic coarctation. Apropos a rare case of arterial hypertension. An uncommon case of high blood pressure secondary to subisthmic aortic coarctation and cured surgically by arterial revascularization is reported. It is probably a congenital coarctation, because the extensive clinical evaluation and condition of the patient ruled out an acquired disease of the aorta, confirmed by the morphologic operative findings and pathological examinations of the aortic wall. In this case, the clinical diagnosis was initially suggested due to an abdominal systolic-diastolic bruit, associated to hypertension and weak femoral pulses. Although doppler ultrasonography and nuclear magnetic resonance were useful diagnostic tools, a complete angiography should be performed because it is currently the most informative technique to evaluate the aorta and its collaterals, frequently involved in association with subisthmic aortic coarctation. Surgical exploration revealed a hypoplastic descending thoracic aorta and histological data confirmed the nonexistence of acquired pathology of the aortic wall. Surgical management was accomplished successfully and the patient was asymptomatic 41 months after the operation with normal blood pressure, no treatment, and a normal pattern of life. Based on this presentation, the authors describe the etiology, morphology and anatomic classification, clinical manifestations, diagnosis and management of subisthmic aortic coarctation.
