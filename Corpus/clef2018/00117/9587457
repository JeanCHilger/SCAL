Long-term results after surgery of coarctation of the aorta in neonates and children. Surgery is the treatment of choice for coarctation of the aorta in childhood. Coarctation presenting in the neonatal period carries a poorer functional and vital prognosis and it may be opposed to the paucisymptomatic forms observed in infants and children. Coarctation in the neonatal period presents with severe cardiac failure and is often associated with hypoplasia of the transverse aorta and/or other complex congenital malformation. Improved neonatal intensive care and the introduction of prostaglandin E1 have considerably reduced the immediate mortality by enabling surgery to be undertaken under the best possible haemodynamic conditions. However, early and late mortality in this group remain significantly higher due to associated cardiac lesions in this context, the management varies with some groups carrying out surgery in one stage and others in two stages. Despite progress in neonatal surgery and operative techniques to increase the diameter of the transverse aorta, hypoplasia may persist and be a cause of restenosis or secondary hypertension. In this group of coarctations, the main problem is the timing of surgery in order to reduce the risks of restenosis and hypertension to a minimum. Restenosis is diagnosed by clinical examination. Doppler ultrasonography and eventually confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The risk factors for restenosis are young age at surgery, the type of procedure performed and the presence of extensive aortic hypoplasia. Recurrent, localised forms are accessible to percutaneous angioplasty when performed 6 months to 1 year after surgery
