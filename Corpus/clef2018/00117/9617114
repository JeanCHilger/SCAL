Long-term results of radical lumbar ganglionectomy. Our experience. We present our experience of 15 patients operated on by lumbar sympathectomies between 1987-1993, to confirm the effective and permanent efficacy of sympathectomy in peripheral vascular disease of the lower limbs. The patients, 9 men and 6 women (age 58-86) presented with rest pain (12), and minimal toe lesions (3). After an eco color-Doppler and angiography of the lower limbs, a radical operative sympathectomy (L2-L5) was performed in all patients. Associated diseases were: ischemic cardiopathy (61.7%), renal failure (25%), diabetic disease (61.7%), carotid stenosis (25%), abdominal aortic aneurysm (12%). In four patients, was performed during the same surgical time, 2 abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs, and 2 aorto-bifemoral bypasses. No patients died, operative morbidity was 12.5% (2 cases). The clinical and instrumental follow-up performed on 6 patients (38.3%) after 3 years, demonstrated in all cases the regression of the rest pain (12 patients) and the healing of the toe lesions (3 diabetic patients). Our results confirm the efficacy of sympathectomy especially when performed in young patients. The small number of diabetic patients in our study made statistical evaluation difficult, but it is generally considered that the results are worse in diabetic patients, because the microvascular lesions in these patients reduce peripheral vasodilatation.
