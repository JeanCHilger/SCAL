Role of magnetic resonance angiography for assessment of abdominal aortic aneurysm before endoluminal repair. A detailed knowledge of the morphology of the aorta and iliac arteries is an important prerequisite for successful endoluminal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. The best method of preoperative evaluation remains to be determined.A prospective study was undertaken between January 1994 and July 1995 to assess the ability of computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), colour duplex imaging and intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (IA-DSA) to visualize AAA morphology.Eighty-two consecutive patients (64 men, 18 women) with AAA were assessed with MRA, contrast-enhanced CT, colour duplex imaging and IA-DSA. Median age was 74 (range 59-87) years and median AAA diameter was 5.7 (range 3.5-9.7) cm. Five patients were unable to tolerate CT or MRA examination. Seventy-seven patients underwent both CT and MRA. Of these, 55 also had a colour duplex scan and 32 underwent arteriography. The scans were assessed by an independent blinded observer. MRA was significantly better (P < 0.01) at visualizing AAA morphology compared with CT and colour duplex imaging. There was no statistically significant difference between MRA and arteriography.MRA is useful in patient selection for endoluminal AAA repair, as it avoids use of iodinated contrast medium and ionizing radiation.
