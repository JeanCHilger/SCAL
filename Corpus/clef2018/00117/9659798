Visualization of native internal mammary arteries and aorto-coronary graft by means of high resolution color Doppler ultrasonography. The internal mammary artery is routinely used for coronary artery bypass grafting because of its optimal long-term patency profile. This vessel can be imaged by angiography, but only the proximal tract at the origin from the succlavian artery can be imaged by conventional echography. The aim of our study was to visualize the intrathoracic course of the native and grafted internal mammary arteries by a new ultrasound equipment which allows high-resolution transthoracic color Doppler imaging of the chest wall vessels and coronary arteries. We studied 35 patients, 16 non operated and 19 operated of coronary surgery with the internal mammary artery grafted to the left anterior descending coronary artery. We used a multifrequency 3.5-7 MHz transducer with a small insonating surface, placed at the second-fifth intercostal space at the left and right sternal border, to image the native mammary arteries. The grafted mammary artery was detected at the fourth-fifth left intercostal space 2-4 cm lateral to the sternal border. The native left internal mammary artery was visualized in all 16 non operated patients, and the right internal mammary artery in 14/16 (87%). The native left internal mammary artery peak flow velocity was 41-160 cm/s (mean 81 +/- 34 cm/s), and the mean flow velocity was 28-89 cm/s (mean 45 +/- 17 cm/s). The right internal mammary artery peak flow velocity was 35-153 cm/s (mean 82 +/- 36 cm/s), and mean flow velocity was 21-82 cm/s (mean 46 +/- 22 cm/s). The grafted left internal mammary artery was visualized in 16/19 patients (84%), evaluated at 6 days to 36 months after surgery. Peak diastolic flow velocity ranged from 24 to 80 cm/s (mean 48 +/- 17 cm/s), and mean diastolic flow velocity ranged from 13 to 57 cm/s (mean 33 +/- 11 cm/s). The left anterior descending peak flow velocity distal to the anastomosis was 22-62 cm/s (mean 37 +/- 15 cm/s) and mean flow velocity was 18-53 cm/s (mean 29 +/- 12 cm/s). We conclude that transthoracic color Doppler echocardiography allows to image the native and grafted mammary arteries, with potential clinical applications in the management of patients with coronary artery disease.
