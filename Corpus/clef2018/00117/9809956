Differentiating thrombus from pannus formation in obstructed mechanical prosthetic valves: an evaluation of clinical, transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiographic parameters. We sought to determine the clinical and echocardiographic parameters that differentiate thrombus from pannus formation as the etiology of obstructed mechanical prosthetic valves.Distinction of thrombus from pannus on obstructed prosthetic valves is essential because thrombolytic therapy has emerged as an alternative to reoperation.We analyzed clinical, transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) data in 23 patients presenting with 24 obstructed prosthetic valves and compared the findings to pathology at surgery.Fourteen valves had thrombus and 10 had pannus formation. Patients with thrombus had a shorter duration from time of valve insertion to malfunction, shorter duration of symptoms, but similar New York Heart Association functional class at the time of operation. Patients with thrombus had a lower rate of adequate anticoagulation (21% vs. 89% p=0.0028). Pannus formation was more common in the aortic position (70% vs. 21%Duration of symptoms, anticoagulation status and qualitative and quantitative ultrasound intensity of the mass obstructing a mechanical prosthetic valve can help differentiate pannus formation from thrombus and may therefore be of value in refining the selection of patients for thrombolytic therapy of prosthetic valve obstruction.
