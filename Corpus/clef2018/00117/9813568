Unruptured aneurysm of the left sinus of Valsalva extending into the left ventricular outflow tract: presentation and imaging. The symptomatic presentation of an unruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm is rare. A 48 year old man with a history of treated hypothyroidism, and a five year history of ileocolonic Crohn's disease of chronic low grade activity presented with a profound left hemiplegia. He was in sinus rhythm and normotensive. Cardiac auscultation was repeatedly normal. Computed tomography of the head performed early in the course of the illness was reported as normal. Duplex Doppler examination of the carotid arteries performed six months later revealed no significant atheroma. There was complete resolution of the neurological deficit over a period of months. A year later he presented with chest pain suggestive of myocardial ischaemia. Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiography, and cardiac catheterisation pointed to a sinus of Valsalva aneurysm protruding into the left ventricular outflow tract. In view of the previous neurological event and ongoing chest pain suggestive of myocardial ischaemia, the lesion was resected. The patient made a good recovery and postoperative transoesophageal echocardiography showed normal aortic valve function with no residual regurgitation. This is the first reported case of pure left ventricular outflow tract extension of an unruptured left sinus aneurysm. The presentation with ischaemic cardiac pain does not seem to be explained by conventional mechanisms.
