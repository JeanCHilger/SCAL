Rupture of a sinus of Valsalva aneurysm into the right ventricle. A case report in the cardiology clinic at the University Hospital Center of Dakar. We report a case with ruptured aneurysm of the sinus of Valsava into the right ventricle, diagnosed during heart failure in a 22 years old patient. Etiology and prognosis based on our observation and the literature are discussed. Our patient benefited from clinical examination, ECG (15 derivations), pulmonary X ray and standard laboratory test. Pulsed-Doppler and contrast echocardiography have been realized with an ATL MK 600 echocardiograph. These data are discussed and compared to the literature. Cardiac examination revealed a continuous murmur predominantly diastolic 5/6 and an increase of peripheral artery pulsatility. Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and ECG bilateral atrial and left ventricular hypertrophy. Two-dimensional echocardiography revealed the diastolic prolapse of an aneurysmal right coronary sinus in the right ventricle. The rupture was confirmed by contrast echocardiography and pulsed-Doppler. Rupture which is a major complication of aneurysm of the sinus of Valsava, is the usual feature of detection. The consequences of rupture are heart failure and pulmonary edema. Our observation shows that conventional Doppler and contrast echocardiography are important for diagnosis and follow-up of aneurysm of the sinus of Valsava. Aortography, hemodynamic and angiocardiographic data, are also important for a precise diagnosis and the detection of associated malformations when pre-operative investigations of aneurysm of the sinus of valsava are needed.
