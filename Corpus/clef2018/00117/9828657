Use of duplex sonography in selecting the most suitable part of the great saphenous vein (parva) for myocardial revascularization. The submitted investigation deals with the first experiences with duplex sonography using to evaluate the superficial vein system on patients before aortocoronary bypass grafting. We examined 40 patients. In all cases we already could evaluate the quality of vein bed (diameter, anatomy, pathology) before operation and we could determine the best part of vein bed for harvesting. The advantages of this noninvasive method are smaller number of incisions (it results in better healing with less wound infectious complications), better quality and shorter time of harvesting.
