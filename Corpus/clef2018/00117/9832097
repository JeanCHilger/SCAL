Hemodynamics and left ventricular mass regression following implantation of the Toronto SPV stentless porcine valve. Stentless tissue valves may provide more favorable hemodynamics than conventional stented valves. Hemodynamic findings from a large multicenter trial have not been previously reported. The present report describes the hemodynamic findings from a multinational, multicenter study after implantation of the Toronto SPV valve. A total of 577 patients underwent aortic valve replacement with the Toronto SPV valve at 12 sites in 3 countries. Echocardiograms were recorded in the early postoperative period, 3 to 6 months after surgery, 1 year after surgery, and yearly thereafter, with follow-up to 3 years. Gradients decreased and effective orifice area increased in the months after surgery. One year after surgery, mean gradient for valve sizes 20 to 22, 23, 25, 27, and 29 mm was 7.3 +/- 4.4, 7.4 +/- 4.5, 6.1 +/- 3.3, 4.9 +/- 2.4, and 4.0 +/- 2.1 mm Hg, respectively effective orifice area was 1.3 +/- 0.7, 1.5 +/- 0.5, 1.7 +/- 0.4, 2.0 +/- 0.4, and 2.4 +/- 0.6 cm2, respectively. There was a very low prevalence of significant aortic regurgitation at all time periods. There was significant left ventricular (LV) mass regression between the early and 3- to 6-month periods and between the 3- to 6-month and 1-year postoperative periods. The Toronto SPV valve has an excellent hemodynamic profile supported by significant regression of LV hypertrophy in the year after implantation. Data through 3 years demonstrates maintenance of low gradients and freedom from significant aortic regurgitation.
