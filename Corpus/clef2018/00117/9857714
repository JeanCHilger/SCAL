Peri-renal pheochromocytoma. Presented is a case of pheochromocytoma with an ectopic or extrarenal localisation in a 47 year old female farmer. The patient was admitted to the 1st Chair and Clinic of Internal Disease, Jagiellonian University Collegium Medicum due to a three year history of hypertension. The bouts of hypertension were characterised by sudden increases of blood pressure to 250/150 mmHg, which occurred after physical exertion but particularly during the night. On physical examination no abnormalities were detected. Laboratory analysis revealed no changes apart from mild hyperglycemia. 24 hour vanillymandelic acid excretion was normal on two successive accounts, but on a third analysis was raised. Fundus examination revealed bilateral hypertensive and diabetic angiopathy. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a tumor in the region of the pancreas with an echogenicity similar to that of the liver. Abdominal CT scan revealed normal suprarenal glands bilaterally. A smooth walled tumor of 55 mm diameter was visualized below the head of the pancreas. Its structure was not uniform with degenerating features. The tumor adhered to the descending and transverse part of duodenum, compressing the vena cava inferior and was in close proximity to the abdominal aorta. After surgical consultation the patient was transferred to the II Clinic of General Surgery Jagiellonian University Collegium Medicum where after pretreatment with alpha and beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, diuretics and Insulin CHOS the patient underwent surgery. Posterior to the duodenum, inferior to the head of the pancreas, between the aorta and vena cava inferior was a polycystic tumor of 80 mm diameter, which was evacuated in its entirety. Histopathology revealed a paraganglioma with an appearance of pheochromocytoma. On a three month follow up visit the patient was without symptoms. Her blood pressure and glycemia were normal despite being without treatment.
