Hemodynamic features of the freestyle aortic bioprosthesis compared with stented bioprosthesis. The Freestyle prosthesis is a new stentless aortic bioprosthesis. Anticipated benefits are improved hemodynamics and increased longevity.Doppler echocardiograms were performed early and at 3 to 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after operation in 157 patients (69 men, 88 women, aged 48 to 85 years) with this prosthesis, and results were compared with hemodynamic data in patients with Intact and Mosaic stented bioprostheses.Distinctive features of the prosthesis compared with stented prostheses are (1) an increase in effective orifice area (+0.15+/-0.26 cm2 p < 0.05) and a decrease in mean gradient (-3.5+/-4.0 mm HgThe hemodynamics of the Freestyle are very satisfactory and represent a marked improvement in comparison to stented prosthesis.
