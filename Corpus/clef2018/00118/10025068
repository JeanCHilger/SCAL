IVUS-controlled aorto-ostial directional coronary atherectomy in higher grade stenosis of the central anastomosis of a sequential triple venous bypass. Following coronary artery bypass grafting repeat ischemia mandatory for reintervention occurs in 2 to 30% of cases, depending mainly on graft age. Selection of a suitable strategy for revascularisation--transcatheter angioplasty or reoperation--depends on various parameters including coronary morphology, left ventricular performance, comorbidity and availability of graft material. Catheter-based interventions on saphenous vein bypass grafts are feasible, but lower primary success rates and a higher incidence of restenosis--compared with native coronary arteries--have to be expected. Repeat coronary artery bypass graft operations are associated with a significantly higher perioperative morbidity and mortality, patency rates are lower and late clinical outcome is worse than in primary surgery. We report on a patient who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting 4 years ago revealing a high grade ostial stenosis in a jump-graft supplying RCA, LAD and Cx sequentially, making reintervention necessary. As a prerequisite serial balloon angioplasty of two native vessels was performed prior to ostial intervention. Intravascular-ultrasound guided directional coronary atherectomy was performed with good primary and long-term result. Our case demonstrates that, if all relevant clinical parameters and different therapeutic options are taken into account, complex transcatheter angioplasty procedures are feasible and associated with a reasonable amount of risk, thus avoiding repeat coronary artery bypass graft operations.
