Functional hemodynamic assessment of the 21-mm and 23-mm CarboMedics Top Hat aortic prosthetic valve. Between 1993 and 1996 the CarboMedics Top Hat supraannular aortic valve was implanted in 41 patients at the Wessex Cardiothoracic Centre (age, 39 to 74 years mean, 61.3+/-8.9 years). Comparisons of annular dimensions made at surgery indicate that conventional annular valve replacement would have required at least a size smaller valve. This was particularly marked when a prosthetic mitral valve was in place. Operative mortality was 2.4%. There were also three late deaths. Echocardiography before and after symptom-limited treadmill testing has been performed in 21 patients. The mean time to follow-up was 16.1 months. The Doppler-derived indices of forward flow pre- and postexercise were expressed as mean+/-standard deviation. For 23-mm valves the values were: peak valve gradient 21.43+/-7.46 mm Hg and 35.86+/-14.4 mm Hg, aortic valve area 1.13+/-0.39 cm2 and 1.24+/-0.54 cm2. For 21-mm valves the values were: peak valve gradient 24.84+/-8.2 mm Hg and 31.29+/-5.84 mm Hg, aortic valve area 1.08+/-0.44 cm2 and 0.95 +/-0.2 cm2. The Top Hat valve has a good hemodynamic profile at rest and during exercise. Surgical considerations make it particularly useful in patients with a small aortic annulus and in patients undergoing combined aortic and mitral valve replacement.
