Intravenous dipyridamole thallium imaging V combined arm-leg cycle stress testing of patients unable to exercise on the treadmill. Rehabilitation patients who will undergo noncardiac surgery or strenuous rehabilitation programs often cannot exercise to greater than 85% of predicted maximal heart rate as required for valid treadmill testing. Because many patients have known or suspected coronary artery disease, greatly increasing their risk for a cardiac event, dipyridamole thallium scans are usually performed, despite a cost of approximately $1400, patient radiation exposure, and the need for a gamma camera. Instead, arm-leg cycle stress testing can be continued to an appropriately high heart rate, is done in the physician's office with an electrocardiograph machine and a blood pressure cuff, and costs $250. This study describes nine patients who had both dipyridamole thallium scans and arm-leg cycle ergometry. Four awaited peripheral vascular surgery, one needed bilateral knee replacements, one was an amputee, and three had claudication. Six had documented and three had suspected coronary disease.In eight of nine patients, the electrocardiograms during both dipyridamole thallium imaging and ergometry were in agreement as to the presence or absence of ischemia (kappa statistic, 0.7273 P = 0.0117). In seven of nine patients, thallium images and ergometry agreed (78% concurrence). To achieve 90% agreement between dipyridamole thallium scans and cycle results, however, 68 patients would have to be studied.In this preliminary study, arm-leg ergometry was feasible in all patients and seemed cost-effective and useful for detecting myocardial ischemia. Clinically, if the ergometry were inconclusive, dipyridamole thallium scans could be performed subsequently to obtain the needed information.
