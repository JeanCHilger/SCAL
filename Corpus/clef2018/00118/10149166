Piezoelectric lithotripsy monotherapy for partial or total staghorn lithiasis and calculi larger than thirty millimeters. Thirty patients with partial or total staghorn lithiasis or calculi larger than 30 mm were treated by piezoelectric lithotripsy (PEL) monotherapy using an EDAP LT-01 lithotripter with ultrasound guidance.  Nineteen of these patients had a pelvic stone the other 11 had partial (nine) or total (two) staghorn lithiasis.  All patients first underwent an initial lithotripsy session.

Prior to the first session, 18 of 30 patients had a sterile urine culture
