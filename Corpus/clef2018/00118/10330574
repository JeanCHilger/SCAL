Modern diagnostic approaches to investigations of abdominal aorta changes in flying personnel. Modalities of the modern radiation diagnostics (USI and computer tomography) in expert investigation of the ventral aortas in pilots of different aircraft were demonstrated. The most effective diagnostic algorithm of investigation and determination of hypertrophy of the ventral aorta, and detection of the atherosclerotic plaques calcinosis has been developed and its importance for medical certification demonstrated. Morphostructural changes in the ventral aorta were featured and correlated with the debilitating occupational conditions in different types of aviation.
