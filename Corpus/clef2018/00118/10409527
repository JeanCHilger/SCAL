Haemodynamic performance of aortic pericardial bioprostheses and bileaflet prostheses at rest and during exercise: implications for the surgical management of patients with small aortic roots. To determine the haemodynamic behaviour, at rest and during exercise, of aortic valve pericardial bioprostheses and different sizes of bileaflet prosthesis.Observational study.Tertiary medical centre.74 patients (33 women, 41 men mean age 64 years) in whom 40 pericardial bioprostheses and 34 bileaflet prostheses sized 19, 21, or 23 mm had been implanted to replace aortic valves.Doppler echocardiography at rest and at peak exercise, between 12 and 47 months after surgery.All patients achieved a significant increase in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and cardiac output with exercise. Transvalvar pressure fall, valve area, and left ventricular systolic and diastolic function indices also underwent significant changes with exercise. Reductions in peak and mean transvalvar pressure, at rest and at peak exercise, were greater in patients with small valves (p < 0.05). Valve areas and effective area index were greater in the patients with larger valves (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences between patients with mechanical and biological prostheses with regard to transvalvar pressure fall and valve areas at rest and at peak exercise.19 mm and 21 mm aortic prostheses and bioprostheses continue to create significant obstruction, particularly with exercise.
