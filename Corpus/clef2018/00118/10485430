Two-stage repair of a combined aneurysm of the descending aorta and the aberrant right subclavian artery. In cases of combined aneurysms of the descending aorta and the aberrant right subclavian artery a common surgical strategy has not been clearly elaborated. In this report the case of a 76-year-old male patient with this rare combination of aneurysms is presented. The surgical strategy consisted of a two-stage approach for repairing both aneurysms maintaining the perfusion of the right subclavian and vertebral artery, finally providing an excellent postoperative result even in a patient of this advanced age.
