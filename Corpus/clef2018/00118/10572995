Hydronephrosis after aorto bifemoral graft surgery: a marker for late graft complications. Ureteral obstructions are serious late complications after aortoiliac reconstructive vascular surgery, which lead to loss of kidney function if they remain untreated. One case report serves to describe the incidence, aetiology, clinical presentation and treatment options of an obstructive uropathy following graft surgery. Hydronephrosis due to a ureteral obstruction is considered as a "marker" of graft complication. Therefore, ultrasound examination and close follow-up beyond 1 year are recommended in all patients who undergo aortoiliac surgery.
