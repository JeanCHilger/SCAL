Modulation of platelet aggregation after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the iliac artery for atherosclerosis obliterans. Platelet aggregation is modulated by blood flow. We investigated whether platelet function is altered during percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty in patients with atherosclerosis obliterans.Blood samples were obtained from the iliac artery in 9 lower limbs of 7 patients undergoing percutaneous balloon angioplasty of the iliac artery. An agonists-induced platelet aggregation test was performed with an aggregometer. Femoral blood flow was measured with a Doppler velocimeter before and after the procedure.Before dilatation, the maximum platelet aggregation rates (+/- SEM) induced by adenosine phosphate, epinephrine, and arachidonic acid were 54.7% +/- 5.8%, 64.8% +/- 4.3%, and 60.5% +/- 6.1%, respectively. After angioplasty, these values reduced to 36.7% +/- 4.1%, 36.1% +/- 8.6%, and 40.1% +/- 5.0%, respectively (P < .05). The pre-procedural ankle-brachial pressure index, mean flow rate, mean velocity, and shear stress variation were 0.63 +/- 0.1, 218.1 +/- 32.1 mL/min, 9.4 +/- 1.1 cm/sec, and 60.6 +/- 17.7 dyne/cm2, respectively. The mean velocity at the stenotic lesion was 215.1 +/- 83.9 cm/sec, which was significantly greater than those of the distal artery or after angioplasty (P < .01). Both ankle-brachial pressure index and shear stress variation increased after angioplasty to 0.99 +/- 0.07 (P < .05) and 139.8 +/- 17.0 (P < .05) dyne/cm2, but the mean flow rate and the mean velocity (198.3 +/- 24.5 mL/min and 8.8 +/- 1.2 cm/sec after angioplasty) did not change significantly.These results indicate that activated platelet function at a stenosed artery was decreased after angioplasty, possibly because of normalized blood flow with reduction of stenotic lesion.
