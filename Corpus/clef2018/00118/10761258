Doppler ultrasound (pre- and post-contrast enhancement) for detection of recurrent stenosis in stented renal arteries: preliminary results. The purpose of the present paper was to assess whether conventional renal Doppler ultrasound and the commonly used parameters of peak systolic velocity and renal aortic ratio may be an appropriate modality for the follow-up of renal artery stents. A total of 19 arteries in 15 patients was examined with both renal Doppler ultrasound and angiography for the presence or absence of recurrent renal artery stenosis. Disease was considered present on angiography if the arterial diameter was more than 60% stenotic. Doppler criteria for stenosis were either a peak systolic velocity of > 180 cm/s or a renal aortic ratio of > 3.0. Echo enhancement with Levovist (Schering, Berlin, Germany) was used if studies were technically unsuccessful or to improve diagnostic confidence. Renal Doppler ultrasound detected 100% of renal artery stenoses. The specificity was 75%, the positive predictive value was 67% and the negative predictive value was 100%. Echo enhancement improved the technical success rate from 89 to 95% and also increased diagnostic confidence in six examinations. The present limited study suggests that similar renal Doppler parameters as used for the study of unstented renal arteries may be applied to the examination of renal arteries with renal stents in situ. It therefore suggests that Doppler ultrasound may provide an adequate non-invasive means of renal artery stent follow-up, particularly when combined with echo-enhancing agents. Further study is warranted to confirm these initial conclusions.
