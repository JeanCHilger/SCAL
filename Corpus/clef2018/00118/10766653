Follow-up after infraligamental PTA treatment. A total of 48 percutaneous transluminal angioplasties (PTAs) of the superficial femoral and popliteal artery performed between 1993 and 1998 were evaluated with ultrasound duplex scanning and ankle-arm pressure. Twenty-seven (60%) patients presented with claudication and 18 (40%) had limb-threatening ischaemia. Three patients had bilateral PTA. The PTAs were initially successful, corresponding to an early patency rate of 87.5% within the first four weeks. The 12 month patency rate, calculated by life table method, was 68% and 72%, respectively (non-significant). The mortality was 4% and 33% respectively during the first year (p < 0.05). In spite of the size of the material, PTA of the femoropopliteal arterial segment is considered as a valid alternative treatment to vascular surgery in patients presenting with claudication and in patients presenting limb-threatening ischemia.
