Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis with septic embolism of popliteal artery: a case report. A 20-year-old man presented with a 14-day course of fever. Physical examination showed petechiae of the conjunctivae, Janeway lesions on both hands, a grade III/VI systolic murmur over the apex, pulseless dorsal pedal artery and posterior tibial artery of the right leg, and a pale right foot. Femoral arteriogram of the right leg revealed total occlusion of the popliteal artery with collateral circulation of the posterior tibial artery. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed trace mitral regurgitation. Embolectomy of the right popliteal artery was done, and penicillin and gentamicin treatment was administered. However, postoperative fever developed intermittently. Transesophageal echocardiogram disclosed vegetation over the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was isolated from all three cultures of blood drawn at admission and from the septic embolus during operation. He had neither evidence of underlying heart disease, nor history of intravenous drug abuse or hospitalization. Exploratory cardiotomy with removal of vegetation on the mitral valve was performed followed by a 4-week treatment with intravenous vancomycin. After discharge, he was well at 2-year follow-up.
