Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography, digital subtraction angiography and duplex of the iliac arteries compared with intra-arterial pressure gradient measurements. to compare gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (Gd-MRA), digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and duplex of the iliac arteries with intra-arterial pressure gradient measurement as the reference method.Gd-MRA, DSA and duplex examinations of the iliac arteries were performed in 30 patients (60 arteries) with lower-limb arterial occlusive disease. In 29 arteries, pressure measurements were made (n=25) or the artery was found to be occluded on catheterisation (n=4). An aortofemoral peak systolic pressure gradient of 20 mmHg or more was regarded as haemodynamically significant. Stenoses with a diameter reduction of 50% or more on MRA or DSA, or an increase in peak systolic velocity greater than 150% (duplex) were considered significant. MRA examinations were evaluated by means of maximum intensity projections (MRA-MIP) and using source images and curved multiplanar reconstruction (MRA-MPR).the sensitivity (specificity) for a significant iliac artery stenosis were 81% (75%) for MRA-MIP, 76% (75%) for MRA-MPR, 86% (88%) for DSA, and 72% (88%) for duplex.with intra-arterial pressure measurements as the reference method, similar results were achieved with Gd-MRA, DSA and duplex concerning the detection of haemodynamically significant iliac artery stenoses. The use of source images and multiplanar reconstructions resulted in higher accuracy for the detection of occlusions.
