Aneurysmal degeneration and late rupture of an aortorenal vein graft: case report, review of the literature, and implications for conduit selection. The saphenous vein is among the most commonly used conduits for renal artery revascularization in adults. Vein grafts are more durable in the renal artery bed than in coronary and peripheral beds, and mechanisms of potential graft failure vary. Coronary vein grafts often fail because of atherosclerotic degeneration, whereas lower extremity grafts fail because of intimal hyperplasia or progression of underlying disease. In contrast, renal vein grafts may dilate over time but seldom fail. This may relate to the distinct hemodynamic environment of the renal bed with low-resistance, high-velocity blood flow. However, frank aneurysmal degeneration of renal vein grafts is rare with only a single report of rupture in the literature. We report an additional case of rupture of a late graft aneurysm and review the literature and our own experience with renal revascularization to underscore the rarity of this serious complication. The saphenous vein for aortorenal bypass grafting continues to be a favorable conduit for renal revascularization. Long-term duplex ultrasound scanning follow-up is recommended to survey the reconstructed artery and perhaps more important, to evaluate progression of subclinical disease in the contralateral renal artery.
