Unique echocardiographic features associated with deployment of the Amplatzer atrial septal defect device. The purpose of this study was to describe the unique echocardiographic findings associated with deployment of the Amplatzer atrial septal defect (ASD) device. Thirty-five patients (2 to 40 years old 23 female and 12 male patients) underwent echocardiography during attempted ASD closure with the Amplatzer device. Transesophageal and transthoracic echocardiograms were performed during the placement and follow-up of the device, respectively. In 5 patients, the device was not deployed because of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) findings (an exceedingly large defect in 3 patients, partial obstruction of the upper right pulmonary vein by the device in 1, and complex atrial septal anatomy in 1). In the remaining 30 patients, after deployment but before release, the device distorted the atrial septum from the normal vertical orientation to an oblique transverse orientation. Excessive septal distortion (i.e., > or =90 degrees in 1 patient) was associated with device embolization upon release. In other patients, TEE also identified mild splaying of the device on the aortic wall, mild abutment of the device upon the mitral valve, and temporary partial obstruction of pulmonary vein flow. Color Doppler revealed residual shunts in 21 of 29 patients immediately after release, but in none of 15 patients at 1-year follow-up. Transesophageal echocardiography is essential to ensure proper Amplatzer device placement. Distortion of the atrial septum and Amplatzer device orientation occur before release but resolve on release from the delivery cable. Small residual shunts are common early, but they resolve in 6 to 12 months.
