The relationship between exercise performance and peripheral circulation in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease. The exercise performance of patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease was often impaired. The relationship of exercise performance, daily physical activity, and peripheral circulation was studied. Twenty-five patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease were recruited their exercise performance was evaluated with a maximal graded exercise test. A habitual physical activity questionnaire was used to quantify the physical activity level. Measurement of peripheral circulation included the assessment of macrocirculation (ankle-brachial pressure index, calf blood flow by impedance plethysmograph) and microcirculation (cutaneous blood flow, cutaneous temperature, transcutaneous oxygen tension, and cutaneous blood flow responses to iontophoresis). Pearson's product correlation coefficient and multiple linear regression were used in data analysis. Results showed that age, sports index in habitual physical activity questionnaire, and ankle-brachial pressure index were significantly correlated with maximal walking time. Age and sports index were the two major determinants for their exercise performance and accounted for a 61.5% variability.
