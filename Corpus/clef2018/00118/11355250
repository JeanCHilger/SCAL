Coronary artery bypass grafting for patients with an atherosclerotic ascending aorta. We review the outcome of coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with a severe atherosclerotic ascending aorta.Subjects were 31 patients averaging 69.4 +/- 6.9 years old studied from 1990 through 1998. Ascending aortic lesions were assessed using epiaortic echo and 2 types of aortic nonclamping techniques applied. In 29 patients operated on in the early years, bypass grafting was conducted on the hypothermic fibrillated heart in 22 and on the beating heart in 7. The remaining 2 underwent off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting more recently. For cases with multivessel disease, we used composite grafting.Three patients developed mild stroke and 5 died within 30 days of surgery--4 from multiple emboli (1 accompanied by a stroke) and 1 from perioperative myocardial infarction. One hospital death occurred due to brain damage and multiorgan failure following unexpected rupture of a saphenous vein graft. No cardiac deaths occurred in the late stage of our series. Actuarial survival was 73.0% for 3 years and 68.0% for 5 years. Freedom from cardiac events was favorable in the remaining 25 survivors.Outcome was suboptimal for the risks involved. Recent technical advances, including coronary surgery on the beating heart with or without cardiopulmonary bypass using variable in-situ or free arterial grafts, associated with adequate evaluation of systemic atherosclerosis, should improve this outcome.
