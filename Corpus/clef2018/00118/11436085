Is prosthetic renal artery reconstruction a durable procedure? An analysis of 489 bypass grafts. Renal artery stenosis has been classically addressed with saphenous vein bypass graft or transaortic endarterectomy performed either primarily or in combination with an aortic procedure. In this series, we report the outcome of our 12-year experience with renal artery reconstruction using prosthetic conduit.Patients undergoing renal artery bypass grafting from 1987 to 1999 were identified. Demographics, indications, concurrent operations, complications, and patency were analyzed. Patients underwent postoperative duplex scan with subsequent ultrasound scans at 6-month intervals.There were 489 procedures performed in 414 patients with indications: high-grade renal artery stenosis in combination with abdominal aortic aneurysm repair or symptomatic aortoiliac occlusive disease (309 [63%]), renovascular hypertension (118 [24%]), and renal salvage (20 [4%]). Indications for the remainder included trauma, renal artery aneurysm, or an infected aortic graft. Inflow was aorta or aortic graft in 95% of patients with the remainder taken from the iliac or visceral vessels. The retroperitoneal approach was used in 97.8%. Nonfatal complications occurred in 11.4% with a 1.4% early and 4.8% late occlusion rate. Renal function worsened in 3.1% of all patients. Secondary patency at 1 and 5 years was 98% and 96%, respectively.Renal artery reconstruction with prosthetic conduit has an acceptable and durable result whether used for primary renal artery reconstruction or concomitant reconstruction with aortic procedures.
