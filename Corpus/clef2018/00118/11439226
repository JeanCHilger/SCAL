Imaging of abdominal aortic aneurysm before and after endoluminal stent-graft repair. Imaging is an essential component of endoluminal aneurysm repair. Detailed imaging with computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and angiography, alone or in combination, is required for the initial assessment and planning. Careful, lifelong follow-up is essential since complications of endoluminal repair may take months or years to appear. Follow-up imaging requires a combination of plain film radiography, colour Doppler ultrasound and helical computed tomography. Magnetic resonance imaging may be valuable for the follow-up of non ferro-magnetic endografts and intra-arterial angiography will be required for specific cases.
