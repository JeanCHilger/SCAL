Bare metal stents with or without coil embolization for abdominal aortic aneurysm exclusion in high-risk patients. The objective of the study was to determine if uncovered self-expanding metallic stents with or without polyester-covered coils can exclude abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). Exclusion using uncovered metal stents with or without coils has been shown to be successful in the animal model. Twelve patients underwent aneurysmal therapy with uncovered self-expanding metallic stents and polyester covered metallic coils (male, 8 female, 4
