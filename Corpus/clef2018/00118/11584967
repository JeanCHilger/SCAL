Magnetic resonance imaging and abdominal wall hernias in aortic surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of abdominal wall hernias (AWH) in patients operated on for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) compared with patients treated for aortoiliac occlusive disease. The efficacy of MRI in early diagnosis of AWH also was studied.One hundred fourteen patients operated for either AAA (51 patients, group A) or aortoiliac occlusive disease (63 patients, group B) constitute the study. The presence of AWH onset was evaluated by clinical observation followed by ultrasonography. Data acquired by ultrasonography were compared with those obtained by MRI to determine the efficacy of this diagnostic tool in all 114 patients. The prevalence of inguinal hernias in both groups also was determined.A significant difference was found in the incidence of AWH. AWH developed in 31.7% (16 of 51) of group A patients and 17.4% (11 of 63) of group B patients (p < 0.03). A significant prevalence ofinguinal hernias was detected in group A (p < 0.01). The Cox hazard regression analysis revealed as independent predictors of postoperative AWH only the presence of AAA and a history of laparotomy.Ours and other studies recall collagen synthesis disorders to explain the statistical association observed among AAA, inguinal hernias, and AWH. MRI, especially in patients at risk, appears to be an effective diagnostic approach to early detection of AWH.
