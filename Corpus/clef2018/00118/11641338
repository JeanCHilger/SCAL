Muscle chemoreflex elevates muscle blood flow and O2 uptake at exercise onset in nonischemic human forearm. We tested the hypothesis that increases in forearm blood flow (FBF) during the adaptive phase at the onset of moderate exercise would allow a more rapid increase in muscle O2 uptake (VO2 mus). Fifteen subjects completed forearm exercise in control (Con) and leg occlusion (Occ) conditions. In Occ, exercise of ischemic calf muscles was performed before the onset of forearm exercise to activate the muscle chemoreflex evoking a 25-mmHg increase in mean arterial pressure that was sustained during forearm exercise. Eight subjects who increased FBF during Occ compared with Con in the adaptation phase by >30 ml/min were considered "responders." For the responders, a higher VO2 mus accompanied the higher FBF only during the adaptive phase of the Occ tests, whereas there was no difference in the baseline or steady-state FBF or VO2 mus between Occ and Con. Supplying more blood flow at the onset of exercise allowed a more rapid increase in VO2 mus supporting our hypothesis that, at least for this type of exercise, O2 supply might be limiting.
