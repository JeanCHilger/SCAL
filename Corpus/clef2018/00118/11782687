Chronic mesenteric ischemia: diagnosis and treatment with balloon angioplasty and stenting. The goal of our research was to evaluate the efficacy of endovascular treatment in stenosis of the superior mesenteric artery and the celiac trunk.During the period 1996-2001, 6 patients (1 woman, 5 men, ages 46 to 73) were referred to our department with abdominal angina. Angiograms were performed in order to establish the reasons. All these patients presented with postprandial abdominal pain and weight loss. Angiography showed stenosis in the superior mesenteric artery in 2 patients, in the celiac trunk in 1 patient, and in both vessels in 3 patients. Typical balloon angioplasty (PTA) was performed with a balloon catheter, 5-8 mm in diameter, inflated up to 18 atm. If more than 30% stenosis remained after PTA, the patient was referred for stenting.In 5 of the 6 patients (83%) PTA was successful. In one patient (17%) with poor results from PTA, a Perflex stent (diameter 7 mm) was implanted in the superior mesenteric artery. The follow-up protocol included clinical and Doppler ultrasonographic examination at 6, 12, and 18 months after surgery. A good clinical and ultrasound outcome was found in 6 patients at 6 and 12 months, and in 4 patients at 18 months.Balloon angioplasty and stent placement seem to be efficient and safe methods of treatment for abdominal angina in stenosis of the superior mesenteric artery and celiac trunk.
