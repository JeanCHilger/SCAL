Intrarenal color duplex examination of aortic endograft patients with suprarenal stents. To report an experience using intrarenal color duplex ultrasonography (ICDU) to detect high-grade renal artery stenosis in patients who had endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with suprarenal stent fixation.Twenty-eight patients (25 men mean age 71 years, range 58-83) who had endovascular AAA repair with suprarenal stenting at least 3 months prior to commencement of this study were screened with ICDU. Acceleration time (AT), peak systolic velocity (PSV), end diastolic velocity (EDV), and resistive index (RI) were measured. The Doppler waveform was quantitatively scored on a scale from 0 to 4. AT >0.07 seconds, RI <0.45, or a Doppler waveform score of 0 or 1 (indicating loss of early systolic peak) were indicative of high-grade renal artery stenosis.Median follow-up was 15.5 months (range 3-34). ICDU was successful in 54 (98%) of 55 kidneys scanned. No AT values exceeded 0.07 seconds, all RIs were >0.45, and no waveforms had loss of early systolic peak, indicating that no patient had evidence of high-grade renal artery stenosis.ICDU is a simple and affordable method that seems well suited to periodic screening in patients with suprarenal stents. Longer follow-up with a larger number of patients is needed before definite conclusions can be drawn about the effect of suprarenal stenting on renal circulation.
