Five-year experience with valve sparing surgery for aortic root aneurysms. The aim of this study was to analyze the mid-term results of aortic root reconstruction.Between September 1995 and March 2001, 32 patients (25 males, 7 females, median age 58 +/- 21 years) underwent aortic root reconstruction as described by T. David. Indications for operation were aortic insufficiency with ascending aortic aneurysm in 27 patients, and acute aortic dissection (Stanford type A) in 5 patients. In all patients the native valve was preserved and suspended inside a tubular prosthesis with reimplantation of the coronary arteries. In 10 patients the classic reconstruction technique was modified by shaping a "Neosinus."There was one perioperative death due to myocardial infarction. Two patients suffered a stroke. 26 patients were followed up 12 months postoperatively. 22 out of 26 patients were in NYHA functional class I, 2 patients in class II and the remaining 2 in class III. Three patients died in the postoperative period. Six patients had trivial AR, 4 mild and 1 moderate regurgitation. There were no thromboembolic events during follow up. The mean transvalvular gradient was 3.5 +/- 2.2 mmHg. Compared to a normal cohort of patients (n = 20), resuspended aortic valves opened (26.4 +/- 5.8 vs. 61.3 +/- 22.1 cm/sec, p < 0.0001) and closed (22.8+/- 6.9 vs. 57.9 +/- 22.3) at a higher speeds and also showed shorter opening (0.053 +/- 0.12 vs. 0.023 +/- 0.09 sec, p < 0.0001) and closing times (0.051 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.23 +/- 0.07 cm/sec) of the aortic leaflets.Aortic valve reimplantation is a reliable technique able to reduce long term complications when compared to conventional composite graft replacement of the aortic root. Altered leaflet opening and closing dynamics do not impair midterm durability.
