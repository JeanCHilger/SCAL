Endoleak: predictive value for aneurysm growth at 3 years. Endoleak is a unique radiographic finding after endovascular aneurysm repair. The prognostic implication of endoleak on aneurysm therapy outcome is unknown. Patients with 3 years of follow-up were examined to determine the predictive value of endoleak, as determined by the treating physician, for aneurysm growth. Patients enrolled in a clinical trial for a unibody, bifurcated endovascular graft (Ancure-Guidant/EVT, Menlo Park, CA) were examined with respect to endoleak, as determined by the primary investigator, and aneurysm diameter change. A total of 80 patients were available at 3 years for evaluation. CT scans and ultrasound were used to determine endoleak at discharge, at 6 months, and annually. Patients were categorized as no leak (NL n = 59), early leak (EL, leak identified by 6 months
