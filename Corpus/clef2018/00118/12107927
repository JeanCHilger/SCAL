Detection and treatment of sub-renal aortic aneurysms. The risk of rupture of infrarenal aortic aneurysms justifies screening with ultrasound scanning in patients older than 65 years with cardiovascular risk factors. In the presence of an aneurysm measuring less than 5 cm in diameter, ultrasound surveillance can be performed every six months. Operation is indicated as soon as the largest diameter of an infrarenal aortic aneurysm reaches 5 cm or when it increases by one cm over a one-year period. Conventional aneurysm repair remains the reference treatment of infrarenal aortic aneurysms in patients with a good or a moderate surgical risk. Due to the frequent occurrence of complications and to uncertainties regarding the durability of currently available endovascular prostheses, endovascular repair should for the moment be limited to high surgical risk patients. New operative techniques and more adapted biomaterials should contribute to improve the results of the treatment of infrarenal aortic aneurysms.
