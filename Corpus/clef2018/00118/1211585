Posture and epidural block in pregnant women at term. Effects on arterial blood pressure and limb blood flow. Upper and lower limb blood flow was measured in 4 fullterm pregnant women in the left lateral and supine positions before and after epidural block. Radial artery mean blood pressure was recorded in 6 full term pregnant women under the same conditions. Before epidural block there was a much greater reduction in lower limb blood flow (39-1%) than in upper limb blood flow (13-5%) when women moved from the lateral to the supine position this was probably the result of aortic compression. Mean radial artery pressure increased slightly by 4-6% due to maternal overcompensation in the upper part of the body. After epidural block, patients in the lateral position had a mean rise in lower limb blood flow of 25% and a reduction in upper limb blood flow of 37-2%. The mean arterial pressure remained unchanged. In the supine position there was no further reduction of upper limb blood flow
