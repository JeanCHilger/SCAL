Complications following endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. There is a growing population of patients who have undergone endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) and thus there is an increasing likelihood that radiologists who are unfamiliar with this technique and its complications will have to report radiological investigations on one of these patients. The purpose of this review is to describe and illustrate the normal and abnormal radiological appearances after EVAR on plain radiography, ultrasound and CT.
