Stent-graft repair of the thoracic aorta: short-term results. The purpose of this study was to evaluate clinical feasibility and immediate outcome of stent-graft repair of the thoracic aorta. From December 1999 to January 2001, a total of 14 patients underwent stent-graft repair of the thoracic aorta. The underlying etiologies were traumatic rupture of the aortic isthmus in four cases, Stanford type B dissection in four, thoracic aortic aneurysm in three, penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer in two cases, and postoperative aortoesophageal fistula in one case. Stent-graft placement was performed under angiographic control in all cases in association with transesophageal echography in seven cases. The procedure was performed under emergency conditions in five cases. Thirteen patients presented contraindications for surgery. Stent-graft placement was successful in all cases. No further surgery has been performed in any case. Thus we conclude that endovascular treatment of the thoracic aorta using stent grafts is a promising therapeutic modality in patients with contraindications for conventional surgical treatment.
