Percutaneous infusion system for in situ thrombolysis in the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries. To report successful treatment of an occluded aorta with a new percutaneous infusion system.A 57-year-old man was admitted in severe pain with cyanosis and acrocyanotic pigmentation in the lower abdomen and limbs. The patient had symptoms of renal disease and severe oligoanuria. Ultrasound scanning detected no flow in the lower limbs, and angiography identified total thromboembolic occlusion of the aorta immediately below the origin of the renal arteries. A new Trellis percutaneous thrombolytic infusion system was used for controlled site-specific infusion and dispersion of streptokinase into the abdominal aorta and the iliofemoral arteries bilaterally with successful restoration of flow and no complications.The Trellis system is effective for rapid lysis of thrombotic emboli using low doses of lytic agents. The unique design of the Trellis allowed complete aspiration of the residual thrombus, thus avoiding adverse effects.
