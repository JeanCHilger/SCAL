Comparison of pulmonary venous flow velocities and left ventricular diastolic and ejection time in patients with moderate mitral and aortic stenosis. Pulmonary venous flow velocities in mitral and aortic stenosis. Doppler pulmonary venous flow velocities (PVFV) pattern are useful parameters in assessing the left ventricular diastolic functions. Both mitral stenosis (MS) and aortic stenosis (AS) lead to diastolic dysfunction. We compared PVFV and left ventricular diastolic and ejection time (ET) in patients with moderate MS and AS.Forty-three patients with moderate MS (group 1), 65 patients with moderate AS (group 2), and 33 healthy subjects as controls (group 3) were included in this study. After obtaining standard measurements echocardiographically, diastolic period (DP), ET, the ratio of the DP to the ET (DP/ET), isovolumetric contraction time (ICT), isovolumetric relaxation time (IRT), peak systolic flow velocity (PS), peak antegrade diastolic flow velocity (PD), peak reversal flow velocity at atrial contraction (PRA), the ratio of the peak systolic to the diastolic flow velocity (PS/PD), deceleration time of the antegrade diastolic flow (PDDT), and pressure half time of the peak antegrade diastolic flow velocity (PDPHT) were measured. Mitral valve area (MVA), aortic valve area (AVA), systolic pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), peak and mean gradients were calculated with standard formulas.In univariate analysis, MVA was correlated with PDPHT and PDDT (r = -0.41 p < 0.01, r = -0.36Moderate MS and AS similarly affect the PVFV, and PS/PD correlates with hemodynamics similarly both in MS and AS. Nevertheless, PDDT and PDPHT correlate with solely MVA. IRT higher in AS than MS, though DP/ET and ICT higher in MS than AS, and DP/ET relates with the severity of both MS and AS.
