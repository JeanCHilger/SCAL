Intravascular ultrasound aids in the performance of endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm. The purpose of this retrospective review was to assess the accuracy of aortic measurements with intravascular ultrasound scan (IVUS) compared with computed tomographic (CT) scan and to assess the role of IVUS in the performance of endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs).Seventy-eight patients undergoing repair of AAA with the AneuRx stent graft (Medtronic AVE, Inc, Santa Rosa, Calif) underwent measurement with CT scan and IVUS. The initial selection of stent graft size was made on the basis of the CT scan measurements, but the final decision for size was made on the basis of the IVUS measurements. Standard measurements of a phantom tube obtained with IVUS, CT scan, and digital caliper were also compared.IVUS measurements of the phantom standard agreed closely with CT scan measurements. However, stent graft size initially selected with CT measurement was altered in 28% of cases on the basis of intraoperative IVUS measurements. No type I endoleaks were encountered in our series, and no aortic cuffs were necessary for endoleak repair.IVUS accurately measures the aorta for selection of stent grafts for endovascular repair of AAA and may prevent type I endoleaks and remedial procedures for their repair.
