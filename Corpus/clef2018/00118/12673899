Bone mineral decrease in the leg with unilateral chronic occlusive arterial disease. The links between osteoporosis and arteriosclerosis have been established by numerous epidemiological studies. Could arteriosclerosis induce bone mineral loss via ischemia or other pathological process? We carried out a comparative study of bone mineral density in both legs of patients with unilateral arterial disease of the lower limbs.We studied 25 patients, 22 men and 3 women, whose mean age was 62.3 years (range 35-88 years). These patients had unilateral lower limb arterial disease of at least 3 months duration with a systolic index at least 50% lower on the affected than on the healthy side. Bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral densities (BMD) of the femoral neck, femur, tibia, foot and ankle of the affected and the unaffected legs were measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry (Lunar DPXL) and the results compared.Bone mineral density was significantly lower in the femur (-3.7%, p = 0.04), the foot and the ankle (-3%, p = 0.05) of the affected leg. There was a non-significant decrease in BMD of the whole femoral neck (-1.2%) and the trochanter (-4.4%, p = 0.08) on the affected side. Tibial bone mineral density was identical in both legs. Bone mineral content was lower on the affected side (-5.3%, p = 0.05) whereas fat mass and muscle mass were the same in both legs.The ischemia resulting from arterial disease of the lower limbs appears to have a direct deleterious effect on bone mineralization.
