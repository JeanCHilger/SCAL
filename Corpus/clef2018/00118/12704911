Functional diagnosis with color ultrasound in occlusion of peripheral arteries. In recent years the number of the patients with occlusive disease of the peripheral arteries is increasing also in Japan. For such patients there are many methods to make final diagnosis. Among a lot of methods we have chosen color duplex sonography for functional diagnosis in the patients with occlusive disease of the peripheral artery. During 2 years we have investigated color duplex sonography in addition to digital subtraction arteriography for 40 patients (68 limbs) with occlusive disease of the peripheral artery. First of all waveform of blood flow and the systolic velocities of the dorsal- and the posterior tibial arteries as well as the brachial artery were observed and measured. The blood flow volume and the ratio of systolic velocities and flow volume of lower to upper extremity (AVI, AFI) were measured and their values were also analysed in each patient. These data were compared with Fontaine's classification as a clinical symptom. For the patients with Fontaine class I, or II conservative treatments were carried out, and operative interventions such as bypass graft, or endovascular operation were carefully performed for the patients with Fontaine's class III or IV. Consequently, clinical symptoms and waveforms of systolic flow, and its velocity were remarkably improved by surgical interventions. Thus, color duplex sonography was a useful procedure to make diagnosis and to decide operative indication in the patients with occlusive disease of the peripheral artery.
