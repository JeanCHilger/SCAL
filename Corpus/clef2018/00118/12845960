Laparoscopic cholecystectomy: a report on 2000 cases. This is a retrospective study to evaluate the results of laparoscopic cholecystectomy after 2000 cases at a single center.Between June 1992 and February 2000, 2000 patients (1458 females and 542 males, mean age 39.8 years) with symptomatic gallstones underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. All cases were diagnosed by abdominal ultrasonography. Preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was done for 31 patients. Four trocars were used for all except 20 cases.The mean operative time was 45 +/- 15 minutes. Conversion to open cholecystectomy occurred in 147 patients (7.35%). Adhesions were the commonest cause of conversion (2.9%). There was no technique-related mortality. Bile duct injury occurred in 7 cases (0.35%), reconstruction by Rouxen-Y hepaticojejunostomy was necessary in 5 cases and the injury was successfully managed by endoscopic stent in 2 cases. Bile leakage occurred in 11 cases (0.55%), peritonitis in 5 cases (0.25%), internal hemorrhage in 9 cases (0.45%), cystic artery injury in 17 cases (0.85%), pneumothorax in one case (0.05%) and subcutaneous emphysema in 3 cases (0.15%).Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a good alternative to open cholecystectomy with an acceptable morbidity. Conversion to open cholecystectomy at the proper time will prevent major complications.
