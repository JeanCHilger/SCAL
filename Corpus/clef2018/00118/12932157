Endoluminal AAA repair using intravascular ultrasound for graft planning and deployment: a 2-year community-based experience. To examine the effectiveness of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) for preoperative planning and intraoperative deployment of stent-grafts to treat abdominal aortic aneurysms.One hundred seventy patients (143 men mean age 73.6+/-7.2 years, range 51-89) underwent successful DSA and IVUS to determine suitability for stent-graft repair. Patients subsequently received the AneuRx (n=157) or Ancure (n=13) deviceReliable preoperative IVUS measurements were obtained in all patients. Plaque morphology was assessed in 140 (82.3%) aortic necks in 36 (25.7%), preoperative IVUS showed high-grade atherosclerotic plaque in the nonaneurysmal abdominal aortic neck. The procedure was successful in 168 (98.8%) cases (1 [0.6%] acute conversion and 1 access failure). There were 2 (1.2%) periprocedural deaths related to bowel ischemia. Four (2.3%) patients developed graft occlusion/kinking and 2 (1.2%) developed renal failure requiring dialysis within 30 days. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that female gender (p=0.0247), a short nonaneurysmal aortic neck (p=0.0185), and presence of high-grade atherosclerotic plaque (p=0.0185) correlated with major acute complications. Over a mean 10.4-month follow-up (range 1-25), 11 patients died of unrelated causesOur findings suggest that IVUS may identify patients at increased risk of major adverse complications following endovascular repair. The combination of IVUS and DSA for endoluminal stent-graft planning and placement provides excellent short- and mid-term patient outcomes.
