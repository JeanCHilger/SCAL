Relation of C-reactive protein and other cardiovascular risk factors to penile vascular disease in men with erectile dysfunction. Erectile dysfunction (ED) may be an early sign or symptom of cardiovascular disease (CVD). We examined the relation of traditional and emerging risk factors for CVD to the severity of penile vascular disease in men with ED and without clinical coronary artery disease (CAD). In total, 137 men with ED were evaluated for penile vascular disease severity by penile Doppler ultrasound. These men were divided into the following groups based on ultrasound results: normal, cavernous venous occlusive disease, mild arterial insufficiency, and severe arterial insufficiency. Traditional (fasting lipid panel, fasting glucose, age, BMI, smoking, Framingham coronary artery disease risk score) and emerging (C-reactive protein, Lp(a), homocysteine) risk factors for CVD were correlated to severity of penile vascular disease in men with ED and without clinical CAD. Using univariate analysis, penile Doppler groups showed significant positive correlation to CRP (r=0.21 < or = 0.05) and age (r=0.30
