MUSCULAR SUBAORTIC STENOSIS: THE EFFECT OF PERIPHERAL VASODILATATION. Amyl nitrite was administered on two occasions to a patient with muscular subaortic stenosis, to ascertain if selective peripheral vasodilatation would affect the degree of obstruction to left ventricular outflow in this condition. On each occasion there was a marked increase in the systolic pressure gradient across the left ventricular outflow tract prior to the onset of reflex tachycardia. Following the second amyl nitrite inhalation, the systolic cross-sectional area of the left ventricular outflow tract decreased to 1.0 sq. cm., from the control value of 2.6 sq. cm. It is believed that the increased degree of muscular subaortic stenosis, following peripheral vasodilatation, could be secondary to a decrease in the systolic size of the whole left ventricle, or to a selective decrease in the physical size of the left ventricular outflow tract.
