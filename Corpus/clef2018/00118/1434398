Ultrasonic methods of diagnosis of late complications after reconstructive surgery of the aorta and major arteries of the lower limbs. Long-standing results were studied in 587 patients who sustained reconstructive vascular surgeries when aged under 16 years (the average age was 6 years and 4 months). Out of them 141 patients faced the necessity of repeated surgeries: in 115 (81.6%) patients the extremity function was preserved, in 19 (13.5%) a repeated amputation was performed, 7 patients (4.9%) expired. All those operated on had been actively followed up with the use of periodical instrumental investigation which included dopplerography and ultrasonic angiography. High significance of ultrasonic technique was proved as the use of it permitted one to detect late complications on the early stages of their development and perform surgical corrections before the development of life-threatening complications. Therefore repeated preventive surgeries were performed in 53 patients, 52 of them were a success. Repeated amputations were performed in 1 patient. All those operated on survived.
