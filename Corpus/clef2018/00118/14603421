LDL cholesterol is associated with small abdominal aortic aneurysms. To examine the relationship between serum lipids and abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA).Two hundred and six males (>50 years) with AAA (> or =30 mm) detected in a population based screening programme were compared with 252 age-matched male controls in a nested case-control study. Smoking status, previous medical and family histories, height, weight, blood pressure, ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) and non-fasting lipid profile were recorded.Cases were found to have significantly higher LDL cholesterol than controls. LDL cholesterol was an independent predictor of the risk for aneurysms in a logistic regression model adjusting for smoking status, family history of AAA, history of ischaemic heart disease, presence of peripheral vascular disease, use of lipid lowering medication and treatment for hypertension. There was a linear effect with increased levels of LDL cholesterol increasing the risk of having a small aneurysm (test for trend p=0.03).The highly significant association between LDL cholesterol and small aneurysms suggests that LDL, possibly acting via inflammatory mediated matrix degeneration, could be an initiating factor in the development of AAA. The ability of statin therapy to prevent AAA formation requires further investigation.
