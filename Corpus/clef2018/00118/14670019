Changes in the proximal neck of abdominal aortic aneurysms early after endovascular treatment. Long-term success of endovascular treatment of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) depends on secure "attachment" of the stent to the proximal and distal necks of the aneurysm. The purpose of this retrospective study was to detect changes in the proximal neck early after endovascular treatment of infrarenal AAA. Between November 1997 and December 1998, we performed endovascular treatment of infrarenal AAA in 43 patients. A bifurcated modular stent (AneuRx by Medtronic) was used in all patients. An oversized stent with a diameter 10% greater than the preoperative diameter of the proximal neck of the AAA was used in all cases. Follow-up examinations were carried out at 1, 6, and 12 months using plain roentgenography, color Doppler ultrasound, and CT scan with contrast injection. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t-test. Deterioration of the aortic neck is the result of a variety of mechanisms. The natural history of the infrarenal neck of AAA following endovascular repair (as well as conventional open repair) is progressive enlargement. Stenting could be an added risk factor for expansion. Strict follow-up is essential for early detection of this complication.
