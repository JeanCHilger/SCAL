Abciximab treatment for obstructive prosthetic aortic and mitral valve thrombosis in the presence of large thrombi, cardiogenic shock, and acute evolving embolic stroke. Obstructive thrombosis of left-sided mechanical prosthetic valves is a life-threatening complication. Intravenous thrombolytic therapy is contraindicated due to risk of clot embolization and surgical treatment is often required for hemodynamically unstable patients. We report for the first time the successful use of abciximab in the management of a patient in cardiogenic shock with multiple prosthetic valve obstructive thrombosis and evolving embolic stroke. Serial Doppler echocardiography and cinefluoroscopy demonstrated resolution of thrombi, improvements in transvalvular gradients and improvement in leaflet motion. This observation suggests abciximab should be considered as a therapeutic option in the treatment of obstructed prosthetic heart valves.
