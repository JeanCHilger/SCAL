Mid-term results after endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms: a four-year experience. The purpose of this retrospective, single-institution study is to describe a 4-year experience of examining early and late clinical outcomes after endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).Between October 1998 and January 2003, 455 patients were submitted for AAA treatment, of whom 269 underwent open repair and 186 were treated with an endovascular procedure. All endovascular-treated patients underwent preoperative arteriography, contrast enhanced CT scanning or spiral-CT to define the morphological characteristics of the aneurysm, including precise diameter and length measurements.Technical success was achieved in 182 (98%) of the endovascular procedures, as intraoperative conversions to open repair and/or aborted procedures occurred in four patients. The perioperative (30-day) mortality rate was 1% (two patients). During the follow-up period (9-60 months) CT, duplex ultrasound scanning and plain abdominal X-ray evaluation were performed at 3, 6, 12 months, and annually thereafter. Type I endoleak occurred in 12 patients (6.6%), required a further endovascular procedure (11) or late conversion to open repair (1). Type II endoleak occurred in five patients (3%).In our clinical experience the endovascular repair of AAA is a safe and effective technique with good mid-term results in patients at standard and high risk.
