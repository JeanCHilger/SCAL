Postendocarditis aneurysm of the right sinus of Valsalva: its echographic diagnosis with preoperative angiographic confirmation. The sinus of Valsalva aneurysm is a rare complication of bacterial endocarditis in infancy and childhood. This report describes a young man with congenital aortic stenosis and bacterial endocarditis caused by Salmonella typhi. Bacterial endocarditis in this young man was complicated by the development of an aneurysm of the right sinus of Valsalva and a severe aortic regurgitation. Two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography proved useful for the initial diagnosis and serial follow-up of this unusual disorder. However, an angiographic examination has been necessary for the surgical correction in order to understand the relationship between the aneurysm and the coronary arteries.
