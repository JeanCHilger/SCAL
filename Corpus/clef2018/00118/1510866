Subclavian artery stenosis masquerading as prosthetic aortic stenosis: a potential source of confusion in Doppler evaluation of aortic valve disease. In this case report we describe a patient with a prosthetic aortic valve in whom a high-velocity signal from a right subclavian artery stenosis initially was mistaken for the aortic jet signal. Differences in the shapes of the jets obtained from an apical and right supraclavicular position suggested different origins of these two high-velocity systolic signals. Correct identification of the origin of each signal was possible with pulsed Doppler recordings of the subclavian artery and high pulse-repetition-frequency pulsed Doppler interrogation of the aortic valve.
