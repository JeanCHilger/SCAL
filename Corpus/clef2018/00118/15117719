Influence of structural geometry on the severity of bicuspid aortic stenosis. Doppler-derived gradients may overestimate total pressure loss in degenerative and prosthetic aortic valve stenosis (AS) due to unaccounted pressure recovery distal to the orifice. However, in congenitally bicuspid valves, jet eccentricity may result in a higher anatomic-to-effective orifice contraction ratio, resulting in an increased pressure loss at the valve and a reduced pressure recovery distal to the orifice leading to greater functional severity. The objective of our study was to determine the impact of local geometry on the total versus Doppler-derived pressure loss and therefore the assessed severity of the stenosis in bicuspid valves. On the basis of clinically obtained measurements, two- and three-dimensional computer simulations were created with various local geometries by altering the diameters of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT 1.8-3.0 cm), orifice diameter (OD
