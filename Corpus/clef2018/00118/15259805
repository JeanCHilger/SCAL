Primary stenting of focal atherosclerotic infrarenal aortic stenoses: long-term results in 13 patients and a literature review. We conducted this study to investigate the value of primary stent implantation for the endovascular treatment of focal atherosclerotic stenoses of the infrarenal abdominal aorta. The data of 13 patients with a localized complex infrarenal aortic stenosis who underwent primary stenting was retrospectively evaluated. The patients (6 females, 7 males) had a mean age of 57.3 +/- 9.1 years (mean +/- SD). In all patients, the aortic diameter was measured on CT sections, and a self-expanding endoprosthesis was primarily implanted followed by dilatation with single or double balloons. In 3 patients, additional distal stenoses were also endovascularly treated. The procedure was technically successful in all patients. No complications occurred except for 2 minor groin hematomas. During the 43 +/- 23 months (mean +/- SD) follow-up (range: 12-96 months), all stented aortic segments remained patent. Clinical patency was lost in 4 patients, which was due to atherosclerosis or restenosis distal to the aorta. In view of the excellent early and long-term results, we believe that primary stenting should be considered the first line treatment in properly selected patients with focal atherosclerotic infrarenal stenoses of the abdominal aorta.
