Femoral anastomotic pseudoaneurysms. The etiopathogenetic hypotheses and the therapy. The authors present two cases of patients with femoral anastomotic aneurysm treated by surgical vascular reconstruction. They underline the role of etiologic factors changing the structure of the arterial wall. The protective action of end to end anastomosis is confirmed. Finally, they recommend an early intervention to avoid life-threatening complications such as rupture and thrombosis.
