Compliance of abdominal aortic aneurysms: evaluation of tissue Doppler imaging. Expansion of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) is due to remodeling of the parietal extra-cellular matrix and may lead to rupture. This remodeling is reflected by compliance which may be an indicator of AAA behavior and thus useful for clinicians. Tissue Doppler Imaging (TDI) is an ultrasonographic modality which allows wall motion measurements along an arterial segment. It has previously been evaluated in normal aortas and was then evaluated in thirty-five patients with AAA. Mean values (+/-standard deviation) characterizing maximum diameter AAA compliance were dilation 809 mum (+/-465), strain 2.2% (+/-1), pressure strain elastic modulus 3.94 10(5) Pa [3.25 4.8] and stiffness 28.8 [24
