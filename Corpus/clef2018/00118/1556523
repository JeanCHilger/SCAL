EDTA treatment of intermittent claudication--a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. A double-blind, randomized multicentre study was undertaken to evaluate the possible effect of chelation treatment with ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA) in patients with severe intermittent claudication. A total of 153 patients received 20 intravenous infusions of either 3 g Na2EDTA or placebo during a period of 5-9 weeks. Vitamin, mineral and trace element supplements were administered orally. The changes observed in the pain-free and maximal walking distances, measured on a treadmill, were similar in the two groups. During the 3-month (n = 149) and 6-month (n = 123) follow-up period, no long-term therapeutic effect of EDTA could be demonstrated. The ankle-brachial blood pressure index remained unchanged throughout the study period. This study failed to demonstrate any effect of EDTA chelation treatment in intermittent claudication.
