A case of surgical treatment of post-traumatic false arteriovenous aneurysm of the right kidney vessels. This paper describes an experience gained with successful surgical correction of post-traumatic false aneurysm of the right kidney vessels in a 36-year-old patient operated on previously for knife wound and intrahepatic abscess. All-round examination (duplex scanning of the renal arteries, multispiral computed tomography, abdominal aortography, and ultrasonography of the kidneys) revealed a false aneurysm of the medium segment of the right kidney artery measuring 31x21x33 mm. The aneurysm was located downwards, to the rear and inwards from the artery, with marginal posteroinferior calcification drained to the venous collector (the right kidney vein) expanded to 36-40 mm. The preoperative diagnosis: a post- traumatic false arteriovenous aneurysm of the right kidney vessels vasorenal hypertension
