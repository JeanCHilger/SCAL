Diagnosis and treatment for limb edema due to venous disease. We described the diagnosis and treatment for limb edema due to venous disease in this paper. Venous limb edema is caused by vein pressure elevation, which is induced by venous reflux, flow disturbance and overflow. Valve incompetence causes varicose vein and deep venous insufficiency of lower extremities. Deep vein thrombosis is the most popular disease among the venous obstruction morbidity. Arterio-venous fistula for hemodialysis sometimes induces venous arm edema due to overflow. Arm edema due to venous hypertension appears more clearly when it is associated by subclavian vein stenosis or occlusion. There are several causes for venous edema. So, we have to make an appropriate treatment based on the clear diagnosis.
