A review of methods currently used for assessment of in vivo endothelial function. An intact vascular endothelium is critical to the maintenance of normal arterial tone and coagulation status. Endothelial injury leading to dysfunction is thought to be a precursor to most if not all vascular disease, and has been implicated as a critical event in atherosclerosis. At present there are several methods available for detection of in vivo endothelial function, and the aim of this study was to critically review these methods. Five distinct methods were identified and studied in detail. These methods are diverse and each assesses a different vascular bed. Importantly there is no uniformity among investigators over choice of method and protocol, making it difficult to compare in vivo enothelial dysfunction between groups. These issues need to be addressed in large scale comparative analyses so that investigators can agree a common approach to endothelial function assessment.
