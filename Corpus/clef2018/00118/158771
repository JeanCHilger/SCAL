The age factor in blood flow in the calf and in vascular resistance at rest and in reactive hyperaemia. The blood flow and vascular resistance in the calf were studied in two groups of healthy subjects (mean ages 22 and 49 years) at rest and in reactive hyperaemia produced by five minutes' ischaemia of the lower limb. The blood flow was determined by venous occlusive plethysmography and vascular resistance was computed from the mean blood pressure measured by auscultation on the arm and from the blood flow in the calf, at rest and during reactive hyperaemia. The resting flow and blood flows throughout practically the whole time of hyperaemia were found to be significantly smaller in young individuals. The maximal flow was significantly lower, the maximal flow time was significantly prolonged in young subjects. The recovery time and repayment of the flow debt in the two groups were the same. Vascular resistance in the calf was significantly greater in young subjects, both at rest and during dilatation. We assume from the results that the capacity of the arterial system in the lower limbs is significantly smaller in young individuals.
