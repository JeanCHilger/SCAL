Ultrasound of arterial graft surgery complications. The value of gray scale ultrasound in evaluating primary diseases of the abdominal aorta and peripheral vessels has been well documented. However, only limited attention has been given to complications associated with arterial graft surgery. Twelve patients with a variety of complications are reported. These include 10 anastomotic pseudoaneurysms, one abscess, two "aneurysms" in degenerated graft material, and four serous fluid collections around intact Dacron grafts. The latter two complications are previously unreported.
