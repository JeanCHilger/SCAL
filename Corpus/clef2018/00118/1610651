Unilateral iliac artery occlusive disease: a randomized multicenter trial examining direct revascularization versus crossover bypass. Association Universitaire de Recherche en Chirurgie. This randomized trial compared the patency of direct unilateral aorto- or iliofemoral prosthetic bypass with that of crossover femorofemoral or iliofemoral bypass in unilateral atheromatous occlusive disease of the iliac artery. Between May 1986 and March 1991, 143 patients were enrolled in this study (74 crossover and 69 direct revascularizations). Cardiovascular risk factors, preoperative symptoms, and atheromatous lesions were similar in both groups. Patients were followed by Duplex scanning with systolic pressure index measurements. Routine digital subtraction arteriograms were obtained postoperatively and separately, when hemodynamic anomalies developed. Mean follow-up was 22 months. One patient with direct revascularization died postoperatively. Primary patency of direct revascularizations was 89.8% at 48 months compared with 52% for crossover bypass. This difference was statistically significant. Secondary patency of direct and crossover revascularization at 48 months was 92.9% and 93.6%, respectively (not significant). Even though crossover bypasses seem attractive because of their technical simplicity and low morbidity, our results suggest that direct revascularizations are preferable in the young patient with no major operative risks, while crossover bypasses remain indicated in patients at risk.
