Transhepatic balloon dilation of anastomotic biliary strictures in liver transplant recipients: the significance of a patent hepatic artery. To determine the significance of hepatic artery steno-occlusive disease on the patency of anastomotic biliary strictures in liver transplant recipients after transhepatic balloon dilation.A retrospective review of records of all patients undergoing transhepatic balloon dilation for anastomotic biliary strictures after orthotopic liver transplantation was performed over an 8-year period. Patency of the anastomosis was based on subsequent cholangiography. The presence of hepatic artery steno-occlusive disease was determined by Doppler ultrasound and/or angiography. The anastomotic biliary stricture patency rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method.Thirty-eight patients who had undergone liver transplants underwent 53 balloon dilations for anastomotic biliary strictures (nine patients for arterial disease, 26 patients had patent arteries and three patients had arteries of indeterminate patency). Eight of the 53 strictures treated (15%) were refractory to balloon dilation: 10.5% of first comers and 27% of restenotic lesions. Two of the 53 strictures treated (4%) had significant complications: hemobilia requiring blood transfusion and ductal rupture. One-year cumulative primary patency rates for anastomotic biliary strictures for patients with arterial disease, patent hepatic arteries, and all-comers were: 0%, 45% (P = .01), and 36%, respectively. One-year cumulative primary patency rates for choledocho-choledocal and choledocho-jejunal anstomoses in patients with patent arteries were 43% and 48%, respectively (P = .10).In the presence of hepatic artery disease there is a lower patency of anastomotic biliary strictures after balloon dilation. Imaging of the hepatic artery should be considered to stratify patients who will have a successful outcome.
