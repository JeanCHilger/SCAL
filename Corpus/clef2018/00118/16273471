The treatment of advanced chronic lower limb ischaemia with marrow stem cell autotransplantation. Conventional methods of critical leg ischaemia treatment are of limited efficacy. Amputation, as an ultimate solution, is not so rare. The results of marrow stem cell therapy as a potential novel approach to peripheral artery disease management were presented in 2002 by Tateishi-Yuyamy.To assess efficacy and safety of critical lower limb ischaemia treatment with marrow stem cell autotransplantation.Ten patients suffering from chronic leg ischaemia in Fontaine IV stadium were involved in the study. They did not require emergency amputation and had previously been unsuccessfully treated with conventional therapy. Autologic marrow stem cells were condensated by a separator from bone marrow samples taken from the iliac crest. The cells were delivered intramuscularly by repeated injections into the pedal and tibial regions. The number of CD34 and AC133 positive mononuclear cells in each sample was evaluated by flow cytometry. After two weeks and one, two, three and twelve months the following parameters were measured: Laser Doppler Flux (LDF), percutaneous oxygen partial pressure, ankle-brachial index (ABI), visual analgesic scale (VAS), analgesic therapy requirement and ulceration area. Also, lower leg angiography and scintigraphy were performed.An improvement of the peripheral blood flow assessed by Laser Doppler Flux and percutaneous oxygen partial pressure was found. Pain severity decreased in the majority of patients. Amputation was required in three patients in whom the therapy failed. No side effects of the therapy were observed. The clinical effect of the treatment did not correlate with the amount of cells injected.Marrow stem cell autotransplantation into the ischaemic lower limb seems to be a potentially effective method of peripheral perfusion enhancement. Further studies are needed to clarify the underlying mechanisms of such improvement.
