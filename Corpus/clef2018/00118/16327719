Venous ulcer on the hand due to a treatment-related arteriovenous fistula. An arteriovenous fistula of the arm for hemodialysis needs to last long and provide easy access for puncture.A 50 year-old woman, with type 2 diabetes complicated by chronic renal failure, presented with an ulcer on the dorsum of the right hand that had developed over the past year. Humeral artery to basilica vein, side-to-side, arteriovenous fistula in the right arm was created in 1996. In 1999, she received a renal transplant. In 2002, she developed a deep ulcer on the dorsum of the right hand that progressed over one year, without improvement good local treatment. Doppler echography and a fistulography revealed proximal stenosis of the basilica vein, and a less restricted distal stenosis before the shunt. A venous ulcer on the dorsum of the hand due excessive venous pressure in the draining area.The complications of arteriovenous fistulas can be severe. Arterial stenosis is frequent and is the consequence of intimal hypertrophy. Chronic ischemia symptoms can be observed, but the hemodynamic loss is usually asymptomatic. When clinical signs are noisy emergency surgery is required. Venous stenosis is responsible for ischemia through venous overload, leading to edema of the arm, and rarely to venous-ulcer type trophic disorders as seen in this patient. Screening for stenosis on the vascular vein network must be systematic before creating an arteriovenous fistula.
