Cross-sectional relations of peripheral microvascular function, cardiovascular disease risk factors, and aortic stiffness: the Framingham Heart Study. Aortic stiffness and small-artery structure and function share various risk factors however, relations between these 2 measures of vascular function are complex and incompletely understood.We examined hyperemic forearm blood flow, an indicator of microvascular structure and function, and aortic stiffness in 2045 participants (1107 women, mean age 61+/-9 years) in the Framingham Heart Study offspring cohort. Using arterial tonometry, we evaluated 3 measures of aortic stiffness: brachial pulse pressure carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (CFPWV), which is related directly to aortic wall stiffnessOur findings indicate that abnormal aortic stiffness and increased pressure pulsatility are associated with blunted microvascular reactivity to ischemic stress that is in excess of changes attributable to conventional cardiovascular disease risk factors alone, including mean arterial pressure.
