A pilot study of L-arginine supplementation on functional capacity in peripheral arterial disease. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) impairs walking capacity and is often associated with a profound endothelial vasodilator dysfunction, characterized by reduced bioactivity and/or synthesis of endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO). Previous studies have suggested that dietary supplementation of L-arginine, the precursor of NO, improves endothelium-dependent vasodilation, limb blood flow and walking distance. However, these studies have been small, and have used large intravenous doses of L-arginine. The optimal dose of L-arginine has not been determined. Accordingly, this pilot study was conducted to establish the lowest effective oral dose of L-arginine to improve walking distance in preparation for the definitive study. Patients with PAD and intermittent claudication (n = 80) participated in this study. Eligibility criteria included: (1) ankle-brachial index (ABI) at rest < or = 0.90 (2) post-exercise reduction in ABI > or = 25%
