Increased levels of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in patients with Type II diabetes mellitus after myocardial infarction are related to endothelial dysfunction. The pathophysiology of insulin resistance and atherosclerosis may share a common inflammatory basis, maintaining endothelial dysfunction, suggesting why patients with T2DM (Type II diabetes mellitus) have an impaired prognosis after an MI (myocardial infarction), but it remains unclear how these parameters are inter-related. Forty patients with an MI (20 patients with and 20 patients without T2DM) took part in this cross-sectional study. Endothelium-dependent [FMD (flow-mediated dilation)] and -independent [NTG (nitroglycerine)] vasodilatation (determined by ultrasound), S(I) (insulin sensitivity index determined by isoglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp) and serum levels of CRP (C-reactive protein), TNF-alpha (tumour necrosis factor-alpha), IL-6 (interleukin 6), resistin and adiponectin (determined by ELISA) were measured. Associations between FMD/NTG and S(I), and CRP, TNF-alpha, IL-6, adiponectin, resistin, lipids, blood pressure, BMI (body mass index) and brachial artery diameter were then assessed. FMD (2.1 compared with 4.7%
