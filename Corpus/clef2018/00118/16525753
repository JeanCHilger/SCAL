Peripheral vascular disease endovascular management in patients scheduled for cardiac surgery: a clinical-angiographic approach. Endovascular management of peripheral vascular disease before cardiac surgery is still debated. We sought to present our preliminary experience of endovascular stent placement in patients scheduled for urgent cardiac surgery.Between November 2003 and August 2005, 20 patients scheduled for urgent coronary surgery (13 males, mean age 72.5+/-5.3 years) underwent endovascular repair of PVD on the basis of clinical and angiographic indications. Aspirin (100 mg/day) plus low molecular weight heparin (nadroparin calcium) 100 IU/kg/12 h for urgent coronary surgical revascularization was administered after the procedure.Endovascular stenting has been performed in four clinical settings: renal artery stenting prior to coronary surgery (nine patients) to decrease the impact of extracorporeal circulation on an impaired renal function, iliac artery artery angioplasty and stenting (eight patients) in order to facilitate aortic balloon pump insertion after surgery, subclavian artery angioplasty and stenting propedeutical to arterial conduits bypass surgery (one patient), carotid artery stenting before coronary surgery (two patients). All patients underwent successful endovascular repair followed by cardiac surgery. At a mean follow-up of 12+/-4.6 months all patients are alive and without evident thrombosis or restenosis of the implanted vascular stents.Endovascular treatment of PVD in patients scheduled for urgent coronary surgery may be effective, relatively safe and lasting in spite of low dose antiplatelet regimen.
