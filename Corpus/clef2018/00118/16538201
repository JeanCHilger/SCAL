Does use of hydrophilic guidewires significantly improve technical success rates of peripheral PTA? To determine whether the use of hydrophilic guidewires has increased the technical success rate of peripheral percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA).We performed 125 procedures and analyzed the technical success rates of PTA using the conventional guidewire first and then if needed, the hydrophilic guidewire for iliac and SFA stenoses or occlusions. Angioplasty was performed on 25 stenosed, 25 occluded iliac arteries and 25 stenosed, 50 occluded femoral arteries. The result was defined as technical success when the lesion was crossed by a guidewire and balloon, then it was dilated with restoration of vessel lumen and less than 30% residual stenosis and the rise in ABI values was at least 0.15 after 24 hours.The technical success rate after PTA of stenosed iliac arteries was achieved in 96% (24/25) using conventional wires and 100% using hydrophilic guidewire in iliac occlusions, the rates were 60% (15/25) and 96%, respectivelyIn summary, we report an overall improvement and high technical success rate for peripherial PTA. The use of hydrophilic guidewires made significant difference to the technical success rate of PTA, especially in occlusion and more complicated lesions.
