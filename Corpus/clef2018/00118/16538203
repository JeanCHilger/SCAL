Colour Doppler ultrasound in preoperative assessment of the neck vessels in patients with tumours of the oral cavity and the neck region. The aim of the study was not only to establish the applicability of color Doppler ultrasound of the neck vessels in patients with tumors of the oral cavity and the neck region but also to check whether the coexistence of sclerotic changes in the carotid arteries is essential in determination of the sequence of surgical procedure.Color Doppler ultrasound was performed on 110 patients, aged 15 -71 years with tumors of the oral cavity and the neck. The localization, size, echogenicity, as well as the tumor relationship to the surrounding structures and big vessels of the neck region was analyzed.Compression of the veins was observed in 27 cases, and of the arteries only in 20 cases. Infiltration of the jugular vein was observed in 8 patients, whereas infiltration of the carotid artery were seen only in 6 patients. Severe internal carotid artery stenosis, due to arteriosclerosis, was observed in 10 patients. Three persons were suggested to be operated on, first due to carotid artery stenosis, later on, due to the oral cavity tumor.It was found that color Doppler ultrasound is useful in deciding upon the method of treatment, while the examination of the neck vessels is helpful in establishing the sequence of surgical procedures in patients with tumors and coexisting arteriosclerosis.
