Ruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm in two patients with subarterial ventricular septal defect. Rupture of a sinus of Valsalva aneurysm (SVA) is a rare, but life-threatening, event and requires immediate recognition and intervention. We present two previously healthy and physically active patients who were 12 and 33 years of age when rupture of a right coronary SVA into the right ventricle occurred. A subarterial ventricular septal defect (VSD) was detectable in both patients. Cardiac surgery involved VSD closure as well as reconstruction of the aortic valve. Considering complications of subarterial VSD, such as aortic cusp prolapse, aortic insufficiency or SVA, we suggest close follow-up and surgical closure of the VSD in case of any aortic valve deformity.
