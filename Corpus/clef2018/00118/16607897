Hemolysis, high-intensity transient signals (HITS) and hemodynamic results after aortic valve replacement with the Medtronic Hall Easy-Fit heart valve prosthesis. Previous studies have shown a correlation between type, orientation and valve size of mechanical heart valve prostheses and the incidence of high-intensity transient signals (HITS). The study aim was to investigate the presence of HITS and hemolysis and the impact of valve size and hemodynamic parameters following aortic valve replacement (AVR) using the new Medtronic Hall Easy-Fit prosthesis.A total of 150 patients (120 males, 30 females mean age 62 +/- 8 yearsAmong the patients, 112 (75%) showed no or low HITS (34% none, 41% < 30/h), while only 38 (25%) had elevated HITS (range 31-100/h, 14% range > 100/h, 11%). Statistical analysis showed a linear association between the HITS count and valve size. A positive correlation between valve size and LDH was observedThe valve size-dependent increase in LDH after AVR corresponds with the observation that the presence of HITS increases with valve size. In light of these findings, the surgical approach to implant the largest size Easy-Fit valve possible should be discussed, given the excellent hemodynamic results provided by the valve, even in smaller sizes.
