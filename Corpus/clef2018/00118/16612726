Early systolic notched peripheral Doppler flow pattern as an indicator of functional obstruction of the common iliac artery after iatrogenic aortic dissection: a case report. We report on a 57-year-old male patient with typical claudication localised in the right thigh, following aortic valve replacement. The ankle brachial index under resting conditions is within normal range on both sides. A conspicuous monomorphic double-humped peripheral Doppler flow pattern with an early systolic notch extending to the baseline can be registered in all the arteries of the right lower limb. The flow patterns of all other peripheral arteries are properly configured and of triphasic morphology. As the underlying cause of the pathologically altered Doppler flow morphology, aortic dissection Type A can be detected, extending from the former cannulation site of the ascending aorta into the right common iliac artery. Its dissection membrane functionally occludes the right common iliac artery in the early systole, the effect being brief and reversible. The pathogenesis of this morphologically altered Doppler flow pattern and potential differential diagnoses are discussed in this case report, also considering the current literature.
