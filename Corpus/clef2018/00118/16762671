Abdominal aortic aneurysm presenting as back pain to a chiropractic clinic: a case report. The aim of this study was to discuss a patient with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) who presented to a chiropractic teaching clinic and review the pathophysiology, therapeutic strategies, and complications associated with treatment of AAA.A 69-year-old male patient experienced right-sided low back pain with radiation into the right leg for 3 weeks. The radiologic examination of the lumbar spine showed a 7.0-cm AAA and degenerative joint disease in the lumbar spine. Real-time ultrasonography showed an approximately 6.0-cm (transverse diameter), 4.1-cm (anteroposterior diameter), and approximately 7.0-cm (long) infrarenal AAA. Computed tomographic angiography showed additional bilateral iliac artery aneurysms.This patient was treated with an endovascular stent graft repair of the abdominal aorta and bilateral iliac artery aneurysms. He has done well after surgery.This article provides a case study and an overview of AAA. Rupture of an aortic aneurysm is preventable by cautious surveillance and the recognition of suspicious physical and radiographic findings in the population at risk. Early detection reduces mortality because repair is elective rather than emergent.
