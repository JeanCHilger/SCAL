Intravascular ultrasound-guided creation of re-entry sites to improve intermittent claudication in patients with aortic dissection. To report percutaneous fenestration of aortic dissection flaps to relieve distal ischemia using a novel intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)-guided fenestration device.Two men (47 and 62 years of age) with aortic dissection and intermittent claudication had percutaneous ultrasound-guided fenestration performed under local anesthesia. Using an ipsilateral transfemoral approach, the intimal flap was punctured under real-time IVUS guidance using a needle-catheter combination through which a guidewire was placed across the dissection flap into the false lumen. The fenestration was achieved using balloon catheters of increasing diameter introduced over the guidewire. Stenting of the re-entry was performed in 1 patient to equalize pressure across the dissection membrane in both lumens. The procedures were performed successfully and without complications. In both patients, ankle-brachial indexes improved from 0.76 to 1.07 and from 0.8 to 1.1, respectively. Both patients were without claudication at the 3- and 6-month follow-up examination.Percutaneous intravascular ultrasound-guided fenestration and stenting at the level of the iliac artery in aortic dissection patients with claudication is a technically feasible and safe procedure and relieves symptoms.
