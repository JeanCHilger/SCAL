Ischemic cardiomyopathy: remote complications and their prognostication after isolated myocardial revascularization. Aim of investigation was to study rate of remote cardiovascular complications after aorto-coronary grafting (ACG) in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and revelation of informative pre- and early postoperative markers of left ventricular (LV) function for determination of prognosis of cardiovascular complications and functional state of patients in remote postoperative period. Doppler echocardiographical parameters of left ventricular function were assessed in pre- and early postoperative period in 107 patients in whom cardiovascular events did not recur in late postoperative period (during 1 year) and in 63 patients who had recurrent cardiovascular events. Influence of a sign (x) on probability p(x) of cardiovascular events in postoperative period was estimated on the basis of logistic model. Rate of cardiovascular complications during 1 year after ACG in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy was 40%. Most significant prognostic markers of cardiovascular complications in remote postoperative period were LV ejection fraction and deceleration time of early filling before surgery and in early postoperative period, as well as LV end systolic diameter in early postoperative period (p<0.05).
