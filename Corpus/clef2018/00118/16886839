Type-2 diabetes and carotid stenosis: a proposal for a screening strategy in asymptomatic patients. The objective of this prospective observational study was to establish the prevalence of carotid atherosclerosis in an asymptomatic diabetic population and to determine predictive factors for a screening optimization. A total of 300 consecutive type-2 diabetic subjects (166 males, 134 females) underwent a physical examination and duplex carotid scanning. Patients with a recent cerebrovascular event (< or = 6 weeks) or previous carotid surgery were excluded. The prevalence of carotid stenosis > or = 60% or occlusion was 4.7% the prevalence of carotid atherosclerosis was 68.3%. Risk factors for stenosis > or = 60% or occlusion were the presence of diabetic retinopathy (OR: 3.62
