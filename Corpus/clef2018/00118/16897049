Bilateral cervical arterial dissection as a sign of proximal aortic dissection: a rare cause of recidivating TIA. Proximal aortic dissection is a life-threatening disease. In addition to other complications, involvement of the brain-supplying arteries can lead to acute cerebral ischemia. In the presented case, only the patient's clinical course and duplex sonography, which showed bilateral cervical arterial dissections, led to the diagnosis of aortic dissection. This case emphasizes that early ultrasound examination is crucial in patients with suspected cerebral ischemia.
