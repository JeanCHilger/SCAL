Aortic arch atheroma: stroke reduction in cardiac surgical patients. Cardiac surgery is increasingly performed on elderly patients with extensive coronary artery abnormalities who have impaired left ventricular function, decreased physiologic reserve, and multiple comorbid conditions. Considerable numbers of these patients develop perioperative neurologic complications ranging from subtle cognitive dysfunction to more evident postoperative confusion, delirium, and, less commonly, clinically apparent stroke. Magnetic resonance imaging studies have elucidated that a considerable number of patients have new ischemic brain infarcts, particularly after conventional coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Mechanisms of cerebral injury during and after cardiac surgery are discussed. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography and epiaortic scanning for detection of atheromatous disease of the proximal thoracic aorta is paramount in identifying patients at high risk from neurologic injury. It is important to recognize that our efforts to minimize neurologic injury should not be limited to the intraoperative period. Particular efforts should be directed to temperature management, glycemia control, and pharmacologic neuroprotection extending into the postoperative period. Preoperative magnetic resonance angiography may be of value for screening patients with significant atheroma of the proximal thoracic aorta. It is likely that for patients with no significant atheromatous disease, conventional coronary artery revascularization is the most effective long-term strategy, whereas patients with atheromatous thoracic aorta may be better managed with beating heart surgery, hybrid techniques, or medical therapy alone. Patient stratification based on the aortic atheromatic burden should be addressed in future trials designed to tailor treatment strategies to improve long-term outcomes of coronary heart disease and reduce the risks of perioperative neurologic injury.
