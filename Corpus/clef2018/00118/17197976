Successful iliac vein and inferior vena cava stenting ameliorates venous claudication and improves venous outflow, calf muscle pump function, and clinical status in post-thrombotic syndrome. Stent therapy has been proposed as an effective treatment of chronic iliofemoral (I-F) and inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombosis. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of technically successful stenting in consecutive patients with advanced CVD (CEAP3-6 +/- venous claudication) for chronic obliteration of the I-F (+/-IVC) trunks, on the venous hemodynamics of the limb, the walking capacity, and the clinical status of CVD. These patients had previously failed to improve with conservative treatment entailing compression and/or wound care for at least 12 months.The presence of venous claudication was assessed by > or =3 independent examiners. The CEAP clinical classification was used to determine the severity of CVD. Outflow obstruction [Outflow Fraction at 1- and 4-second (OF1 and OF4) in %], venous reflux [Venous Filling Index (VFI) in mL/100 mL/s], calf muscle pump function [Ejection Fraction (EF) in %] and hypertension [Residual Venous Fraction (RVF) in %], were examined before and after successful venous stenting in 16 patients (23 limbs), 6 females, 10 males, median age 42 years range, 31-77 yearas, left/right limbs 14/9, using strain gauge plethysmographyCompared with the control group, limbs with I-F +/- IVC thrombosis before stenting had reduced venous outflow (OF4) and calf muscle pump function (EF), worse CEAP clinical class, and increased RVF (all, P < 0.05). At 8.4 months (IQR, 3-11.8 months) after successful I-F (+/-IVC) stenting, venous outflow (OF1, OF4) and calf muscle pump function (EF) had both improved (P < 0.001) and the RVF had decreased (P < 0.001), at the expense of venous reflux, which had increased further (increase of median VFI by 24% P = 0.002)Successful I-F (+/-IVC) stenting in limbs with venous outflow obstruction and complicated CVD (C3-C6) ameliorates venous claudication, normalizes outflow, and enhances calf muscle pump function, compounded by a significant clinical improvement of CVD. The significant increase in the amount of venous reflux of the stented limbs indicates that elastic or inelastic compression support of the successfully stented limbs would be pivotal in preventing disease progression.
