Peripheral arterial disease: diagnosis, treatment, and systemic implications. Peripheral arterial disease is common in adults and is found in many patients with lower extremity ulcers. It is important to diagnose peripheral arterial disease not only because of its impact on the involved lower extremity but also because it often occurs with atherosclerotic disease in other vascular beds. Although patient symptoms may be helpful in the diagnosis, most afflicted patients either are asymptomatic or have atypical symptoms. Physical examination, an ankle-brachial index, referral to a noninvasive vascular laboratory, contrast angiography, and magnetic resonance angiography can be helpful diagnostically. Beneficial therapies include smoking cessation, exercise therapy, cholesterol reduction, antiplatelet therapy, and treatment of hypertension and diabetes. For patients with symptomatic claudication, cilostazol can be considered. Patients with nonhealing ulcers, rest pain, or severe claudication should be referred for interventions.
