Independent association of increased trunk fat with increased arterial stiffening in postmenopausal patients with rheumatoid arthritis. We recently reported increased arterial thickening and stiffening in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to which inflammation and increased bone resorption contributed. The current study examined the possible involvement of trunk fat in increased arterial stiffening in postmenopausal patients with RA.RA patients (n = 30) and healthy controls (n = 30), all postmenopausal women, were examined for body adiposity and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and waveform analyzer, respectively. Subjects having other diseases and predisposed to atherosclerosis were excluded. Trunk:peripheral fat ratio was calculated as the fat mass of the trunk divided by the sum of the fat mass of arms and legs. Bone mineral density (BMD) at ultradistal radius was measured by peripheral quantitative computed tomography. Inflammation markers and bone resorption markers were also measured.Age, body mass index, and systolic blood pressure (BP) of RA patients were 60.8 +/- 9.8 years, 22.5 +/- 3.3, and 129.6 +/- 20.8 mm Hg, respectively, which did not differ from data from healthy controls. Duration of RA was 10.4 years with mean daily dose of prednisolone 3.02 +/- 3.85 mg. RA patients exhibited a significantly greater trunk:peripheral fat ratio (1.041 +/- 0.253 vs 0.839 +/- 0.223 p < 0.001) and baPWV value (1544.7 +/- 304.9 vs 1373.8 +/- 256.1We showed that increased trunk fat was significantly and independently associated with increased arterial stiffening in postmenopausal patients with RA.
