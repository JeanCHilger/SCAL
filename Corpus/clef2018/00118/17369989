Surgical treatment of chronic mesenteric ischemia: report of one case. Although the classic therapy for chronic mesenteric ischemia is surgical revascularization, endovascular therapy is a new therapeutic option. We report a 55 year-old female, with a 2 years history of post prandial abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and weight loss, with occlusion of both mesenteric arteries and critical stenosis of the celiac artery. The initial treatment consisted in angioplasty and celiac artery stent placement in two occasions, with a brief symptomatic relief. Finally, a visceral artery bypass was performed, with good post operative outcome and complete symptomatic resolution at one year follow up. In our opinion endovascular therapy is a good therapeutic option for chronic mesenteric ischemia in high surgical risk patients, specially when dealing with stenotic injuries. It may also be a complement for patients who need to recover their nutritional status prior to revascularization surgery. On the other hand, due to the long term patency and symptomatic relief, surgical treatment is a good option in low risk patients.
