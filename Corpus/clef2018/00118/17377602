Angioplasty and STent for Renal Artery Lesions (ASTRAL trial): rationale, methods and results so far. Atherosclerotic renovascular disease (ARVD) is a relatively common condition which may lead to progressive renal dysfunction, and eventually to end-stage renal failure. Revascularization has been used in an attempt to prevent progression of ARVD, despite a lack of evidence for a benefit on kidney function. Therefore, large-scale randomized trials are needed to determine reliably whether or not there is any worthwhile benefit. The Angioplasty and STent for Renal Artery Lesions (ASTRAL) trial comparing renal function in ARVD patients randomized to either revascularization or medical management alone was designed to provide this evidence. ASTRAL started recruiting in November 2000 and, as of the end of 2006, 731 patients have been randomized into the trial (19 patients short of its minimum target of 750 patients). A pooled analysis (not split by treatment arm) of all patients shows that serum creatinine increased in the first 6 months then remained relatively steady, whereas blood pressure has decreased from baseline. The trial is due to close to recruitment in April 2007, with the first presentation of the results of the randomized treatment comparison planned for the spring of 2008. To date ASTRAL is by far the largest randomized trial in ARVD, and will provide the most reliable and timely evidence on the role, if any, of revascularization in ARVD with which to guide the treatment of future patients.
