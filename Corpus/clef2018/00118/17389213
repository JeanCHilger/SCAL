Stented versus stentless bioprostheses in aortic valve stenosis: effect on left ventricular remodelling. Whether the use of stentless aortic bioprostheses improves hemodynamics more than stented bioprostheses in the small aortic root is still a matter of debate.Early- and mid-term effects were compared between 2 different types of stentless bioprotheses and 1 type of stented bioprosthesis for left ventricular remodelling. The effects of the bioprotheses were studied by echocardiography in 68 patients (age, 74 +/- 7 years) with aortic annulus diameter < or =23 mm who were undergoing prosthesis implantation due to aortic isolated stenosis. Stented bioprostheses (Carpentier-Edwards Perimount [CEP]) were implanted in 36 subjects and stentless bioprostheses (18 Toronto SPV and 14 Shelhigh Super Stentless) were implanted in 32 subjects.A progressive and similar decrease in left ventricular mass of 30% was observed in both stented and stentless bioprostheses at 12 months. A progressive increase in transprosthetic effective orifice area and a decrease in transprothetic pressure gradient were observed at 3, 6, and 12 months in the Toronto group, but these variables showed improvement only at 3 months in the CEP and Shelhigh groups. No mortality occurred during surgery or during the 1-year follow-up period.Our results confirmed good feasibility of aortic stented and stentless bioprostheses implantation in the elderly population. A 30% decrease in left ventricular mass occurred in the early- and mid-term (12 months) periods after surgery with all 3 types of bioprostheses. Advantages consisting of a progressive increase in transprosthetic effective orifice area and a decrease of the transprosthetic pressure gradient were observed in the Toronto group in comparison to the CEP and Shelhigh groups. These observations may help surgeons in choosing bioprostheses.
