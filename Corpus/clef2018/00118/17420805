Color Doppler imaging of the ophthalmic artery during antegrade selective cerebral perfusion. Postoperative brain damage is a major sequela of cardiovascular surgery. Different methods-such as transcranial Doppler imaging, carotid echography, and fluorescein angiography-can be used to monitor cerebral blood flow, but they present specific limitations.High-resolution color Doppler imaging of the ophthalmic artery is a useful, noninvasive, and inexpensive technique for the evaluation of cerebral blood flow during cardiac surgery signal changes can represent hypoperfusion of cerebral vessels and can thereby indicate inadequate cerebral perfusion during cardiac surgery, especially surgery of the aortic arch.
