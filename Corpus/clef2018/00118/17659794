Transcatheter occlusion of the ruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm with an Amplatzer duct occluder. Ruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm (RSVA) can be associated with ventricular septal defects or isolated lesions. Percutaneous transcatheter closure of RSVA has been an alternative strategy to surgery. The results of transcatheter closure of the RSVA in 10 patients were presented.From January 2000 to May 2006, 10 patients (4 males, 6 females) aged from 7 years to 69 years (mean ages 37+/-18.8 years) were involved in the present report. The diagnosis of RSVA was made based on a combination of several imaging modalities. Of them, 9 patients were identified as congenital cause and one did as acquired RSVA. Two-dimensional and color Doppler echocardiography revealed the rupture of right coronary sinus into right ventricle in 5 cases and into right atrium in 3 cases, while non-coronary sinus ruptured into right atrium in 2 cases. Aortogram showed that the estimated size of the defect was 6.2+/-2.3 mm (2-10 mm). After the establishment of the arterio-venous wire loop, Amplatzer duct occluder (ADO) was deployed by antegrade venous approach in all patients.ADO with 1-3mm larger than the defect was used. All defects were successfully occluded without any complications. On the follow-up, echocardiography showed neither residual shunt nor aortic regurgitation, and there was also no device embolization, infective endocarditis in any of the patients.Transcatheter closure is a feasible and effective alternative for both congenital and acquired RSVA. However, long-term follow-up is mandatory.
