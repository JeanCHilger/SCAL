Skin perfusion patterns (fluorescein perfusography) during reactive hyperaemia in peripheral arterial occlusive disease. From the pathophysiological point of view the regional distribution of blood flow is of special importance in ischaemic tissues. Within this study foot sole skin perfusion was investigated by means of fluorescein perfusography at rest and during reactive hyperaemia in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease confined to one limb (Fontaine stage II). Ambient temperatures were maintained around 21 degrees C. Mean fluorescein appearance times on the one side and their standard deviations (SD) and coefficients of variation (CV) on the other side were taken as measures of overall blood supply and homogeneity of flow, respectively. At rest no differences in these parameters could be detected between diseased legs and controls. After a 3-min supra-systolic circulatory arrest at the thigh, a significant reduction of fluorescein appearance times was observed for both groups but was statistically more pronounced in the controls. Furthermore, during reactive hyperaemia standard deviations as well as coefficients of variation decreased significantly only in normal limbs whereas they either remained constant (SD) or even increased (CV) in those with arterial obstructions. All effects associated with reactive hyperaemia showed statistically significant correlations with systolic ankle pressure indices. From these results it is concluded that haemodynamically effective arterial obstructions are followed by not only a restriction of overall hyperaemic blood supply but also a failure to homogenize microcirculatory perfusion in the case of increased flow requirements.
