Bronchial circulation after experimental lung transplantation: the effect of direct revascularization of a bronchial artery. Direct revascularization of a bronchial artery has been proposed as a measure to alleviate the problem of bronchial ischemia after lung transplantation. To assess the effect of restoration of arterial blood flow to the transplanted bronchus, bronchial mucosal blood flow was measured in a model of modified unilateral lung transplantation in pigs. Laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) and radioisotope studies using radio-labeled erythrocytes (RI) were used to measure blood flow at the donor main carina (DC) and upper lobe carina (DUC) after 3 h of reperfusion. The recipient carina was used as a reference point values obtained by LDV and RI were expressed as percentage of blood flow at the recipient carina. Two groups of animals were studied. In group 1 (n = 6) standard unilateral transplantation was performed
