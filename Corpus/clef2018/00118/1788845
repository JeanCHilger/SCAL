Leaflet embolisation from Duromedics valves: a report of two cases. Embolization of parts of mechanical valves has been reported since the inception of prosthetic valve implantation. We report here two cases of embolization of one hemileaflet of a Duromedic bileaflet prosthesis in the mitral position due to a pivot fracture. Both presented with moderately severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary edema and were successfully managed by replacement of the malfunctioning prostheses. The embolised disc was located in the left common iliac artery by abdominal ultrasound and removed by an inguinal, retroperitoneal approach with low morbidity. Both patients left hospital and are doing well to-date.
