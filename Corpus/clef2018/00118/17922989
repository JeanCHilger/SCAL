Differences in risk factors of diabetic foot in the patients in South and North China. To investigate the differences on the diabetic foot problems and its risk factors in south and north of China.Patients with foot problems were surveyed from January 1 to December 31, 2004 in 14 teaching hospitals located in different cities in China, including demographic data, present and past history of the foot problems and peripheral artery disease (PAD), the classification of the foot ulcers based on the Wagner' system, control of the hyperglycemia and lipids disorder, medical cost in hospital and the diabetic complications. All the patients were divided into two groups due to their geographical data, south and north.There were 285 and 349 patients for the group south and group north. No significant differences were found for duration of diabetes or foot problems, fasting or post-meal glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-C, and the numbers of patients with smoke, hypertension, nephropathy or neuropathy between the two groups. There were significant differences for the age (70 yrs vs 66 yrs), percentage of the patients with average person income with over RMB 1000 per month (57.7% vs 45.6%), coronary heart disease (42.6% vs 61.0%) and retinopathy (35.7% vs 49.5%), HbA1c (7.90% vs 8.80 %), LDL-C (2.75 mmol/L vs 2.98 mmol/L), WBC (6.70 x 10(9) vs 7.40 x 10(9)/L), HCT (0.37 vs 0.38), creatinine (87 micromol/L vs 76 micromol/L) and uric acid (333 mmol/L vs 271 mmol/L), and amputation rate (2.6% vs 9.7%) between south and north groups. Logistic analysis showed that severity of the foot problems was associated with ABI and WBC in south group, and with ABI, PLT and HCT in north group.Diabetic foot problems were more severe, with more risk factors and with more medical cost in north patients.
