Usefulness of ultrasonography in carotid arteries and combined positron emission tomography/ computed tomography for diagnosis of Takayasu arteritis with unusual presentation as acute myocardial infarction: a case report. This unusual case of Takayasu arteritis presenting as acute myocardial infarction could be defined by ultrasonography and 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) coregistered with computed tomography (CT). A 55-year-old male was admitted to our hospital with continuous chest pain and left-side neck pain. After primary percutaneous coronary intervention, elevation of inflammatory markers persisted and dull pain in the left side of the neck continued. Ultrasonography revealed characteristic wall thickening of the left common carotid artery and subsequent 18F-FDG PET with CT depicted positive uptake in the left common carotid artery and the vessel wall of the ascending aorta, confirming the diagnosis of Takayasu arteritis. Three months after angioplasty, follow-up cardiac catheterization was performed. Coronary angiography showed no restenosis. During the catheterization, angiography confirmed the mild stenosis in the long segment of the left common carotid artery and the left subclavian artery as well as the focal narrowing and the dilation of the abdominal aorta. This case shows that ultrasonography in the cervical region and combined 18F-FDG PET with CT may be useful in the diagnosis and evaluation of Takayasu arteritis. In addition, we should pay attention to underlying disease even in middle-aged or older male patients with acute myocardial infarction.
