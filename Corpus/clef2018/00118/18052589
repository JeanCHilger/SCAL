Current state of dynamic imaging in endovascular aortic aneurysm repair. Dynamic imaging, in which the time dimension has a specific function in data (image) interpretation, is becoming increasingly important when contemplating endovascular aneurysm repair. Clinical parameters and complications, including proper sizing, successful aneurysm sac exclusion, optimal stent-graft design, endoleaks, graft migration, and stent fracture are beginning to be better understood through dynamic magnetic resonance, ultrasound, and dynamic computed tomography. The current practice using static 3-dimensional reconstructions for the planning and follow-up of aortic aneurysm endograft treatment will most likely evolve, and the use of dynamic aortic imaging will continue to increase. Validation of these imaging modalities in larger scale trials is needed.
