Pathology and diagnostic opportunities of lower limb compartment syndrome. The indication for the surgical treatment of lower limb compartment syndrome mostly depends on the clinical signs, which can be uncertain and often delayed, resulting in a late and insufficient intervention.In this study, the progression of compartment syndrome was monitored with the measurement of intracompartmental pressure and tissue oxygen saturation.16 patients (12 male and 4 female mean age: 62,7 years) underwent acute lower limb revascularization surgery due to critical (more than 4 hour) limb ischaemia. The indications were the following: 5 iliac artery embolisms and 11 femoral artery occlusions. After revascularization, significant lower limb oedema and swelling were detected. To monitor the elevated intracompartmental pressure (ICP), KODIAG pressure meter was used. Tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) was measured with near-infrared-spectroscopy.In 12 cases the IPC exceeded the critical 40 mmHg. In these patients, StO2 was 50-53%, in spite of the successful re-canalisation. An urgent, semi-open fasciotomy was performed in these cases. In four patients, the clinical picture suggested compartment syndrome. However, the measured parameters did not indicate surgical intervention (ICP: 25-35 mmHg, StO2: normal).In addition to the empirical guidelines, we describe an evidence based surgical intervention strategy for lower limb compartment syndrome. Our results and advised parameter intervals help the clinicians to decide between conservative and operative treatment of the disease.
