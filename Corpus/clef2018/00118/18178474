Isolated spontaneous dissection of the superior mesenteric artery treated by percutaneous stent placement: case report. Acute ischemia due to spontaneous dissections of the superior mesenteric artery are uncommon events, with sporadic reports. Therapeutic options include clinical management, direct artery repair, bowel resection, and more recently, endovascular stenting. We present a case of abdominal pain due to superior mesenteric artery spontaneous isolated dissection treated with stent placement and with a favorable 31-month follow-up period.
