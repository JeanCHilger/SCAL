Primary great saphenous vein leiomyosarcoma: report of a case. Leiomyosarcomas rarely arise in primary veins, especially the great saphenous vein. We have found only 20 case reports of leiomyosarcoma arising in the great saphenous vein, most of which manifested as nonspecific symptoms of advanced disease, such as a palpable mass, swelling, and back or abdominal pain. We report the case of greater saphenous vein leiomyosarcoma diagnosed in a 48-year-old man with a 4-month history of an inguinal mass. Ultrasonography and computed tomography showed a 6-cm mass attached to the right superficial femoral vein. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy confirmed that it was a vascular sarcoma. At the time of surgery there was no evidence of distant metastasis therefore, we removed the tumor en bloc along with the sartorius muscle, inguinal lymph nodes, and 10 cm of the common femoral vein, and replaced the femoral vein with a polytetrafluoroethylene graft. A pathological examination revealed poorly differentiated leiomyosarcoma of the great saphenous vein, involving the deep femoral vein, without lymph node involvement. During follow-up, a thrombosis of the prosthesis developed, followed by proximal stenosis, which was treated successfully with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. The patient was found to have lung metastases 25 months after surgery and he died about 5 months later.
