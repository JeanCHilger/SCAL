Insulin resistance functionally limits endothelium-dependent coronary vasodilation in nondiabetic patients. Insulin resistance (IR) is now considered to be a risk factor for coronary arterial atherosclerosis and is likely to be involved in a limited endothelium-dependent vasodilatory function in peripheral circulation. We investigated whether IR impairs endothelial vasodilator function in the noninfarcted coronary artery. In 14 nondiabetic patients (10 males, 66 +/- 6 years) who were selected from 214 patients underwent IR evaluation by glucose clamp, a Doppler flow wire was used to measure coronary flow changes (percent volume flow index, %VFI) during intracoronary administration of papaverin (10 mg) and stepwise administration of acetylcholine (Ach 1, 3, 10 microg/ml per minute) into the non-infarcted left circumflex coronary artery. Insulin resistance was comparatively evaluated by an euglycemic hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp (M value, mg/m(2) per minute) or by a 75g-oral glucose tolerance test (120-min immunoreactive insulin
