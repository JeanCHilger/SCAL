Foreign bodies in the urogenital tract--between iatrogeny and autoerotism. Our objective was to evaluate the cause, diagnosis and management of foreign bodies in the urogenital tract reviewing a 7 years experience.From 2000 to 2007, 12 patients were treated in our department because of foreign bodies localized in the urogenital tract. We retrospectively analyzed the data regarding presentation, diagnosis and management.The foreign bodies from the urogenital tract included: mascara, spray cap, wires, candle, swabs, plastic tube, remnants from JJ ureteral stent and nefrostomy tube. Diagnostic investigations varied from case to case and consisted of: KUB (kidney, ureter and bladder), abdominal ultrasound, urography, computer tomography, and also cystoscopy. The management was endoscopic in 4 (33%) cases, but in the great majority of them--8 (67.6%) it was necessary a classical intervention.Foreign bodies localized in the urogenital tract, represents a relative rare pathology and in many situations those cases have legal implications. Investigations must include radiologic investigations in order to identify their exact location and size. In many cases the management can not be endoscopic and it is necessary a classic intervention.
