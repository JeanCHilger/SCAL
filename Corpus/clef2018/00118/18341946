Low-profile primary stent placement for the treatment of focal calcified ulcerated stenosis in the infrarenal aorta. To analyze the immediate and midterm success of low-profile stent placement in calcified ulcerated lesions of the infrarenal aorta in patients with arterial occlusive disease.In this prospective case series, 13 symptomatic patients (eight men, five women mean age, 64.8 years +/- 12.1The initial technical success rate was 92% (12 of 13 patients). Due to extended calcifications, a residual stenosis of 50%-60% remained in one patient. No peri-interventional complications occurred. The mean follow-up was 26 months (range, 5-53 months). During follow-up, one patient had a restenosis after 7 months and presented clinically with Fontaine stage IIb. Two patients had iliac and/or femoral stenoses, and both presented with Fontaine stage IIb. One patient's symptoms originated from the lumbar spine. Primary patency and primary clinical success rates were 85% and 69%, respectively. According to Kaplan-Meier tables, the freedom-from-symptom rates were 92%, 84%, 73%, and 63% at 0, 7, 12, and 21 months, respectively.Low-profile stent placement in calcified, ulcerated lesions of the infrarenal aorta is an effective and safe treatment for symptomatic stenoses in patients with arterial occlusive disease after a mean follow-up of 26 months.
