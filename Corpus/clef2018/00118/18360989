Ultrasound tissue modifications after polypropylene prosthesis apposition in inguinal hernia. Few studies have addressed the use of ultrasonography in the evaluation of abdominal hernia. In the present study ultrasonography was used to assess tissue modifications after apposition of a polypropylene prosthesis for inguinal hernia. Seventy-two patients submitted to calibrated inguinal hernioplasty (mesh and plugs) in local anaesthesia for inguinal hernia were studied by ultrasonography at 5 days, 1 and 3 months, and 1 year after the surgical intervention. The mesh presented as a small hyperechoic layer. In 50 patients (69.4%) a seroma was present above the mesh. The seroma was < 5 cc in 33 patients, between 5 and 10 cc in 6 patients, and > 10 cc in 11 patients. During the ultrasound examinations no recurrences were found and the mesh was not displaced. The seroma disappeared spontaneously between postoperative days 30 and 90 and was probably related to the size of the hernia and the number of plugs.
