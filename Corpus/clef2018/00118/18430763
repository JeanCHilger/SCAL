The use of statins and fate of small abdominal aortic aneurysms. The aim of this study was to evaluate the value of statins in reducing abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) growth rate and improving freedom from aneurysm repair or rupture. One hundred and twenty-one patients with AAA undergoing ultrasonographic surveillance for at least one year were included in this retrospective study. Patients treated with statins had a decreased linear aneurysm growth rate than those not receiving statins (1.9+/-1.8 mm/year vs. 2.6+/-2.4 mm/year, P=0.27), but this difference did not reach statistical significance. Statin users had a better survival freedom from aneurysm repair or rupture (at 5 years: 72.3% vs. 52.5%, P=0.048). The impact of treatment with statins was even more evident in patients with a baseline aneurysm diameter<40 mm (at 5 years: 84.0% vs. 58.8%, P=0.022). When adjusted for age, coronary artery disease and baseline aneurysm diameter, treatment with statins had significantly better survival freedom from aneurysm repair or rupture (P=0.012, RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.14-0.78). The use of statins seems to slightly decrease the AAA growth rate and to significantly improve freedom from aneurysm repair and rupture.
