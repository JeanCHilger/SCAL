Hemolytic anemia after operation for aortic dissection using teflon felt strips. We report three cases of hemolytic anemia caused by anastomotic stenosis after surgical treatment for aortic dissection in which internal and external Teflon (DuPont, Wilmington, DE) felt strips were used for reinforcement of the aortic stump. To detect this complication, laboratory findings typical of red cell fragmentation syndrome as well as appropriate imaging modalities are necessary. As a precaution, it is necessary to be meticulous when stitching the internal felt strip.
