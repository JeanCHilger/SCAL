Endovascular stent-graft repair for Stanford type A aortic dissection with extra-anatomic bypass. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects of endovascular stent-graft repair for Stanford type A aortic dissection combined with extra-anatomic bypass.To perform endovascular repair for Stanford type A aortic dissection, we tried to extend the landing zone by extra-anatomic bypass to reconstruct the innominate artery, the left common carotid artery or the left subclavian artery, and then achieved the process immediately or at a secondary stage via either the carotid or the femoral approach.Thirty-four patients with ascending aortic dissection (n=8) and aortic arch dissection (n=26) were treated with this technique. Thirty three patients were successfully done aortic endovascular repair, only one died during the operation. The thirty-day mortality rate was 8.8% (3/34), endoleak incidence rate was 11.8% (4/34) and incidence rate of cerebral infarction was 5.9% (2/34). Twenty-nine patients were followed-up for 6-70 months (mean, 24. 5 months). Complete (n=16) and partial (n=13) thrombosis of the false lumen were showed with CT angiography and/or vascular color Doppler ultrasound scanning.Endovascular stent-graft repair combined with extra-anatomic bypass can be a novel option for Stanford type A aortic dissection it is safe, less invasive, and with fewer complications. Nevertheless, indications need further consideration.
