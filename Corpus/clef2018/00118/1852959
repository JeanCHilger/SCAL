Active infective endocarditis complicated by paravalvular abscess. Review of 40 cases. We have performed a retrospective analysis of the clinical, echocardiographic, surgical and necropsy data in 40 patients affected by infective endocarditis complicated by paravalvular abscess. The abscess developed on prosthetic valve in 13 cases, and on native valve in 27. Aortic valve was the most affected (85%). The clinical course was considered to be acute in 52% of the patients. Fever persisted despite of adequate antibiotic therapy in 57%. In 90%, overt heart failure were present. Staphylococcus were the most frequent causative microorganism (S. aureus, 22.5% S. epidermidis, 20%). Bundle branch or atrioventricular block were detected in 18 patients (sensibility, 45%
