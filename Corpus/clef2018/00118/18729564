Nitinol stent implantation in TASC A and B superficial femoral artery lesions: the Femoral Artery Conformexx Trial (FACT). To investigate the impact of nitinol stenting of superficial femoral artery (SFA) lesions with a maximum length of 10 cm (TASC-II A or B) on 1-year outcomes compared to a historical study cohort from the Femoral Artery Stent Trial (FAST).Between January 2004 and August 2005, 6 study sites enrolled 110 symptomatic patients (75 men mean age 68+/-9 years) with a single de novo >70% SFA lesion <10 cm long treated with the self-expanding nitinol Conformexx stent. The primary study endpoint was binary restenosis determined by duplex ultrasound at 12 months. Secondary 12-month endpoints were target lesion revascularization (TLR), ankle-brachial index (ABI), mean Rutherford category, >1-class change in Rutherford category, and major adverse events. Data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle and according to the actual treatment received ("on treatment" analysis). Outcomes were compared to the historical balloon angioplasty (BA) arm and the Luminexx 3 stent arm of the randomized FAST study.Technical success was achieved in 106 (96%) patients at 1 year, the primary endpoint of ultrasound-assessed binary restenosis was reached in 14 (23.3%) of 60 patients (95% CI 13.4% to 36%). This restenosis rate was lower versus the historical BA (38.6%, p=0.057) or Luminexx 3 stent controls (31.7%, p=0.284) from FAST. The clinically driven TLR was 7.4% (7 of 94 clinically controlled patients), which was also lower compared to 18.3% (p=0.098) and 14.9% (p=0.267) for the historical BA and Luminexx 3 stent groups, respectively. The mean Rutherford category was reduced from 2.75+/-0.79 to 0.94+/-1.38 (p<0.0001)This study of patients with SFA lesions documented favorable outcomes using nitinol stents in TASC-II A or B lesions after 1 year. The study was underpowered to prove superiority of the Conformexx nitinol stent design compared to historical balloon only or Luminexx 3 stent groups.
