The clinico-instrumental evaluation of the efficacy of picotamide in treating chronic obstructive arteriopathies of the lower extremities. In 25 patients (19 males and 6 females) suffering from chronic arteriopathy of lower extremities at Fontaine stage II, the clinical efficacy of picotamide was investigated in double blind, cross over placebo-controlled study. Patients were assigned randomly to the treatment with placebo or picotamide (900 mg/die) for three months and, after 15 days of wash-out, to the treatment with picotamide or placebo for the same period. Painfree walking distance and ankle/arm systolic pressure ratio improved significantly only during picotamide treatment. Laboratory monitoring revealed a significant decrease in platelet aggregation and an increase of fibrinogen degradation products only during picotamide treatment. Three patients during picotamide treatment referred transient gastrointestinal discomfort (nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea) however in no case the treatment was suspended because of the appearance of these symptoms. These results indicate that picotamide is an effective drug in the management of chronic arteriopathy of lower extremities.
