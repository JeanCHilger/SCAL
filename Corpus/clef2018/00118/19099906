Transcatheter intervention for critical pulmonary artery valvular stenosis and atresia with intact ventricular septum in neonates. To assess the feasibility of transcatheter intervention for critical pulmonary arterial valve stenosis and atresia with intact ventricular septum in neonates.From June 2006 to January 2008, 13 neonates (9 with critical pulmonary arterial valve stenosis, 4 with pulmonary arterial valve atresia) underwent transcatheter intervention(one of them was premature neonate). Ten of the patients were boys and 3 were girls. The mean age was (17.4 +/- 10.7) days. The mean weight was (3.4 +/- 0.8) kg. All the patients received prostaglandin E(1) infusion to dilate the ductus arteriosus before and during the procedure. Valvuloplasty was performed using a low-profile balloon (2.5 - 4.0 mm in diameter), and then a balloon approximately 1.0-1.2 times the annulus diameter was applied. In patients with pulmonary atresia, the valve was perforated with a radiofrequency wire, and then valvuloplasty was performed.Twelve patients (92%) were successfully treated with transcatheter intervention. Right ventricular systolic pressure decreased by 50% [from (120.1 +/- 17.0) mm Hg (1 mm Hg = 0.133 kPa) to (58.8 +/- 7.7) mm Hg, P < 0.001], and the ratio of the right ventricular systolic pressure to systemic systolic pressure decreased by 44% [from (1.6 +/- 0.2) to (0.9 +/- 0.1), P < 0.001]. The right ventricular angiography showed that the pulmonary valves were opened. The ratio of the balloons to annulus were (1.1 +/- 0.1) (the maximal balloon size range from 6 to 12 mm). The procedure lasted for a mean of (127.5 +/- 32.6) minutes. The duration of fluoroscopy was (25.2 +/- 7.2) minutes. Complications occurred in 4 patients (30%). Hemopericardium occurred in 2 patients, hypoxia in 1 patient and supraventricular tachycardia in 1 patient. One (8%) patient died. The follow-up periods were (7.2 +/- 6.4) months. Three patients had moderate to severe residual pulmonary stenosis. One of them underwent a second balloon dilation at 3 months of follow-up. The other two were waiting for the second dilation. Nine patients had mild to moderate residual pulmonary stenosis. All patients had mild pulmonary regurgitation. Ductus arteriosus was naturally closured in 11 patients, and nearly closured in 1 patient.Transcatheter intervention for critical pulmonary stenosis and atresia with intact ventricular septum in neonates is safe and effective. Some patients may require repeat balloon valvuloplasty.
