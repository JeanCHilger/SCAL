Comparison of colour Doppler ultrasound with venography in the diagnosis of axillary and subclavian vein thrombosis. The primary imaging technique in suspected venous occlusive disease has for many years been contrast venography. Recent studies have shown ultrasound with the addition of colour Doppler imaging to be a suitable alternative method in the diagnosis of lower limb venous thrombosis. We have applied these techniques to the upper limb venous system, and have performed a prospective study of 19 patients (30 limbs) comparing colour Doppler ultrasound with venography in the diagnosis of axillary and subclavian vein thrombosis, for which colour Doppler ultrasound has a sensitivity and specificity of 100%. If vein stenosis is included, the sensitivity falls to 89%. We propose that colour Doppler ultrasound is a suitable first-line alternative to venography in the diagnosis of axillary and subclavian vein thrombosis. In addition to showing the major venous drainage of the upper limb, ultrasound routinely assesses patency of the internal jugular vein, which is, on occasion, of clinical relevance when determining possible future sites of venous access. If, however, colour Doppler ultrasound is normal then bilateral upper limb venography is indicated to exclude a more central venous problem or localized stenotic lesion.
