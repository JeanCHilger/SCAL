Conventional and cine-MRT in patients with aneurysms of the abdominal aorta. We studied 40 patients with aneurysms of the abdominal aorta by MRI. These results were compared with those obtained by real-time sonography (n = 40), angiography (n = 32) and CT (n = 16). In 30 patients the imaging results were compared--as far as possible--with the operative findings. MRI proved more reliable, especially if compared with sonography, in evaluating renal or iliac artery involvement. Mural thrombi were detected more often (93%) by MRI than by CT (85%) or sonography (83%). Cine-MRI showed strong turbulences in 33%. Turbulences did not correlate with the size of the aneurysm.
