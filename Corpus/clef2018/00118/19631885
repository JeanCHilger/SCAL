Visceral embolus protection by catheters with balloon-inflatable tips during hybrid repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm. Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA) are associated with high rupture rates and poor outcome in patients who do not have surgical repair. Endovascular and hybrid techniques have gained increasing acceptance for the treatment of TAAA in patients with multiple comorbidities and an increased anesthetic risk. One of the complications of endovascular repair in TAAA is procedurally related embolism to visceral vessels. Visceral embolism causes bowel ischemia and is a potentially lethal complication. This report illustrates the intermittent use of catheters with balloon-inflatable tips as visceral embolus protection systems. These catheters are easy to apply and demonstrated perfect prevention of visceral embolization. To date, 10 patients have undergone operations at our clinic using this protection system, and no embolic complications were observed at the visceral vessels. Therefore, catheters with balloon-inflatable tips for visceral embolous protection should be considered in patients undergoing a two-stage hybrid TAAA repair to avoid embolus-associated morbidity and mortality.
