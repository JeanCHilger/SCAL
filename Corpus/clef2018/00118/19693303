Progesterone levels and carotid intima-media thickness: a negative association in older northern Chinese men. In experimental research, progesterone has been found to be beneficial to the central nervous and cardiovascular systems however, its potential role in preventing atherosclerosis in elderly men remains unclear. In this prospective study, we analyzed data in 385 older men and women from 6 communities in Beijing, China, in order to discover whether progesterone is associated with carotid intima-media thickness and plaque occurrence. Intima-media thickness and atherosclerotic plaques were determined by use of ultrasonography. Sex-hormone levels were measured by immunoassay. The data were analyzed via analysis of covariance and logistic regression analysis
