Imaging of the endoleak after endovascular aneurysm repair procedure by using multidetector computer tomography angiography. Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are an important cause of death in elderly men. Most used treatment options are endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and open surgical repair. After the endovascular stent graft placement, however, several complications may occur and an important complication of EVAR is endoleak formation which occurs in approximately one-fourth of patients. Endoleak represents a blood flow outside the stent graft lumen but within the aneurysm sac. For these reasons, unlike the minimal imaging follow-up that is typically performed after surgical repair, patients undergoing EVAR require a life-long postoperative surveillance imaging. In the last years, with the advent of multidetector-row CT (MDCT) scanners and the use of specific angiographic protocols (multidetector CT angiography, MDCTA), CT imaging became the most commonly used examination for endoleak detection. Moreover, the volume data obtained can be further rendered to generate high quality two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) images, that allow a better distinction between Endoleak type II, III and IV. Purpose of this study was to review and describe MDCTA potentialities in the detection of endoleak after EVAR procedures.
