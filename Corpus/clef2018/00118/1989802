Doppler echocardiographic assessment of prosthetic aortic valve function. Findings in normal valves. To determine the Doppler-derived aortic flow velocity profiles in relation to type of prosthetic valve and left ventricular function, 70 patients with normal functioning aortic prosthetic valves (group 1 = 44 patients with low-profile mechanical valves and group 2 = 26 patients with high-profile mechanical valves) were evaluated. Peak flow velocity and mean systolic gradient were inversely related to valve size (r = -0.72 r = -0.76) in group 1. On the other hand, aortic flow velocity profiles had significant correlations with left ventricular end-systolic dimension (r = 0.75
