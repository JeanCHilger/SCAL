The modified Ross operation using a Dacron prosthetic vascular jacket does prevent pulmonary autograft dilatation at 4.5-year follow-up. Following the Ross operation, pulmonary autografts tend to dilate over time. This study researches the fate of the pulmonary autograft - at 4.5 years following the modified Ross operation - with special reference to the impact of the modification on (a) pulmonary autograft dilatation, (b) the neo-aortic root geometry, (c) neo-aortic valve function and (d) the coronary artery reserve.A total of 26 patients who underwent the Ross operation were included in this study of these, 13 consecutive patients underwent a modified Ross operation in which the free-standing autograft root was supported externally by a Dacron vascular prosthetic jacket (DVPJ). These patients were compared to a cohort of 13 matched patients who were operated on using the conventional Ross techniqueAt the 47-month median follow-up, there was no significant increase in the size of the entire neo-aortic root in the patients who underwent the modified Ross operation in addition, the geometry of the neo-aortic root was also preserved and the left ventricular function had improved significantly, whilst the aortic valve function and excursion remained satisfactory. All patients, with one exception, in the modified Ross operation group exhibited normal exercise capacity. By contrast, there were significant differences in diameters of the aortic root - between the two surgical techniques in favour of the modified Ross technique - following a median follow-up of 23 months in the patients subjected to the conventional Ross operation.Provision of external support to the entire pulmonary autograft with a DVPJ prevents its dilatation following free-standing pulmonary autograft Ross operation when evaluated at the 4.5-year follow-up. The function and the geometry of the neo-aortic root are not affected negatively by this modification and the patients demonstrated normal exercise capacity.
