The iliac bifurcation device for endovascular iliac aneurysm repair: indications, deployment options and results at 1-year follow-up of 25 cases. The iliac bifurcation device (William A Cook Australia, Brisbane, QLD, Australia) is a new endovascular device for iliac aneurysm repair. We review the indications for use, device characteristics, deployment options and the results of our case series.The most common indication for deployment is endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) with common iliac aneurysm repair. The standard deployment sequence can be adapted to increase the utility of the device. Data were collected prospectively. Follow-up was performed with plain X-ray, ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scan.Between 2004 and 2007, 25 patients had their common iliac artery aneurysm repaired using the iliac bifurcation device. There were 23 male and 2 female patients. Median age was 75 years (range 60-85). The median follow-up was 12 months (range 1-38). Twenty-one procedures were combined with EVAR. The median abdominal aortic aneurysm diameter was 60 mm (range 31-97), and the median common iliac artery aneurysm diameter was 37 mm (range 24-71). Technical success was achieved in 100% of cases. There were no acute branch vessel occlusions. There was one early type I endoleak (4%). There was one death (4%) in the 30-day period post-procedure. There was one late type I endoleak (4%).The iliac bifurcation device achieves endovascular common iliac artery aneurysm repair with preservation of internal iliac artery flow. There are multiple different applications of the device and complementary deployment techniques. High rates of technical success and low rates of branch vessel occlusion are possible.
