Evaluation of diagnosis and prediction of degree of coronary stenosis by CAVI. To investigate the relationship between CAVI (Cardio-Ankle vascular Index) and the degree of coronary artery stenosis in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes, the predictive value of CAVI were evaluated using the degree of coronary artery stenosis.Relevant clinical data including CAMI, BMI, blood pressure, smoking, age, Sbp, Dbp, history and blood biochemistry test were collected in 60 years or older patients with coronary artery stenosis diagnosed by coronary angiography, and the 298 cases were divided into two groups, A group (CAVI > or = 9), B group (CAVI < 9), to investigate the correlativity among the level of CAVI and cardiovascular risk factors at the same time all cases were assigned to group C (diabetes group) and group D (non-diabetic group), to analyse the change of CAVI in coronary artery stenosis patients complicated with diabetes mellitus.A total of 298 eligible patients with coronary artery stenosis were enrolled, including 163 non diabetics and 135 type 2 diabetics. The analysis result shows that there was a positive correlation among CAVI, old age, BMI, LDL-C, multi-vessel lesion, diabetes.The increase of CAVI was most highly related to the coronary artery stenosis. The level of CAVI might be a helpful predictive indexes to the severity of coronary atherosclerosis.
