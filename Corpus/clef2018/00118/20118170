Attitudes and behavior of peripheral arterial disease patients toward influencing their physician's prescription of cholesterol-lowering medication. Among 355 peripheral arterial disease (PAD) patients with low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels > or = 70 mg/dl, we assessed knowledge regarding optimal LDL levels and the importance of LDL-C-lowering therapy. We also assessed PAD participants' behaviors and attitudes regarding their engagement with their physician in treatment decisions for LDL-C lowering. The average baseline LDL-C level of participants was 103.4 mg/dl +/- 30.7 mg/dl. Seventy-six percent of participants were taking at least one cholesterol-lowering medication. Sixty-six percent were unable to define their optimal LDL-C. Only 47% strongly agreed that their own actions and decisions could reduce their LDL-C. Just 29.8% were aware that patients who request specific medications from their physician were more likely to receive them, and 16% had asked their physician whether they should be taking more cholesterol-lowering medication. These findings suggest that further study is needed to identify effective interventions to educate PAD patients and their physicians about the importance of cholesterol-lowering therapy and to encourage PAD patients to participate with their physician in decisions regarding cholesterol-lowering treatment.
