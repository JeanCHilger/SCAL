Predictive risk factors for restenosis after remote superficial femoral artery endarterectomy. Restenosis following remote superficial femoral artery endarterectomy (RSFAE) remains a challenging problem. The determinants predicting failure are lacking. This study investigated patient characteristics with predictive value for restenosis during the first year after RSFAE.A prospective cohort study.A total of 90 patients post-RSFAE were studied for the occurrence of restenosis (peak systolic velocity ratio >or= 2.5) in the first 12 months postoperatively. At baseline, clinical parameters were recorded. Vessel size was measured on the basis of plaque perimeter in the culprit lesion and lumen diameter on perioperative digital subtraction angiography.In 57 patients (63%), a restenotic lesion was diagnosed within 12 months following surgery. Patients with longer time interval between start of ischaemic walking complaints and RSFAE revealed a significantly higher incidence of restenosis (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.3 (1.05-1.52) per 4 years). Small plaque perimeter and small superficial femoral artery (SFA) diameter on angiography were significantly associated with restenosis (HR = 0.54 (0.34-0.88) per 10 mm and HR = 0.46 (0.27-0.78) per 1.5 mm, respectively). In multivariate analysis, age, duration of ischaemic walking complaints and lumen diameter were independently associated with increased risk of restenosis after RSFAE.This study provides evidence that age, vessel size and duration of ischaemic walking complaints before RSFAE are predictive values for restenosis after RSFAE.
