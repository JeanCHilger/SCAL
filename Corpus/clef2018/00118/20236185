Partial aortic root remodeling with an adventitial inversion technique for an acute type a aortic dissection. This case report describes a partial aortic root remodeling, which applied a valve-sparing technique, with an adventitial inversion technique for an acute type A aortic dissection with intimal tear extending into the noncoronary sinus of Valsalva. Postoperative computed tomography at six months showed no dissection or pseudoaneurysm in the aortic root.
