Traumatically-induced thrombosis of the distal ulnar artery. Case report and review of the literature. The authors report on a patient who fell and struck his right hypothenar against a sharp edge. He had immediate pain and reduced circulation in his ring and little fingers. The neurological findings revealed paraesthesia in the two ulnar fingers and loss of abduction strength in the little finger. Treatment was at first conservative, but the symptoms persisted. Four weeks after injury, the patient was referred to our unit. Doppler ultrasound and angiography of the brachial artery were performed, showing an occlusion of the ulnar artery just distal to the space of Guyon. Operative revision was carried out and a 20 mm thrombus removed. Recovery was then uneventful, and all previous symptoms disappeared. A review of the literature is presented and typical symptoms, diagnostic and therapeutic approaches discussed. The need for an early diagnosis and operative revision is demonstrated.
