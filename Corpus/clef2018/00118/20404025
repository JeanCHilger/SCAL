Central, peripheral and resistance arterial reactivity: fluctuates during the phases of the menstrual cycle. The purpose of this study was to document the temporal changes in vascular reactivity occurring simultaneously in central, peripheral and microvascular resistance arteries in the same cohort of women during the normal menstrual cycle. Twenty-three (n = 23) women (mean age (+/-SD) = 19 +/- 1 y) were tested during four phases of a normal menstrual cycle. Delineation of the four phases occurred as follows: (1) the early follicular phase (2) the late follicular (LF) phase
