Association between albuminuria, carotid atherosclerosis, arterial stiffness, and peripheral arterial disease in Korean type 2 diabetic patients. To evaluate the association between albuminuria, carotid atherosclerosis, arterial stiffness, and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in Korean type 2 diabetic patients.In total, 673 type 2 diabetic patients registered with the public health center participated. Following an overnight fast, venous blood and urine samples were collected and analyzed. The carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), amount of carotid plaque, brachial ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), and the ankle-brachial index of each patient were also assessed.Albuminuria was significantly associated with PAD (odds ratio (OR) 2.33 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28-4.25 for normoalbuminuria vs. microalbuminuria and OR 3.28Albuminuria was significantly associated with baPWV and PAD, but not with carotid plaque or CCA-IMT, in Korean type 2 diabetic patients.
