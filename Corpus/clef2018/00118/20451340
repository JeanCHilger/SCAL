Angioplasty of the pelvic and femoral arteries in PAOD: results and review of the literature. Evaluation of percutaneous recanalization of obstructed iliac as well as superficial femoral arteries (SFAs) in patients with peripheral arterial obstructive disease (PAOD).The data of 195 consecutive patients with 285 obstructions of the common and or external iliac artery as well as the data of 452 consecutive patients with 602 long occlusions (length>5 cm) of the SFA were retrospectively analyzed. The lesions were either treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) or Excimer laser assisted percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (LPTA). Overall 316 stents were implanted (Nitinol stents: 136 stainless steel stents: 180) in the iliac artery and 669 stents were implanted (Nitinol stents: 311The overall primary technical success rate was 97.89% for the iliac arteries and 92.35% for the SFA. Minor complications (hematoma, distal emboli and vessel dissection) were documented in 11.79% for the iliac arteries and 7.97% for the SFA. The primary patency rate was 90.3% for the iliac and 52.8% for the SFA after 4 years. The secondary patency rate was 96.84% for the iliac and 77.8% for the SFA after 4 years.Percutaneous recanalization of iliac and superficial femoral artery obstructions is a safe and effective technique for the treatment of patients with PAOD. By consequent clinical monitoring high secondary patency rates can be achieved. The use of a stents seems to result in higher patency rate especially in the SFA when compared to the literature in long-term follow-up.
