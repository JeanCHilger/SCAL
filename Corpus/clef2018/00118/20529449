Cell therapy, a new standard in management of chronic critical limb ischemia and foot ulcer. Fifty percent of diabetics (7% of general population) suffer from peripheral arterial occlusive disease, which may lead to amputation due to critical limb ischemia (CLI). The aim of our study was to prevent major limb amputation (MLA) in this group of patients using a local application of autologous bone marrow stem cells (ABMSC) concentrate. A total of 96 patients with CLI and foot ulcer (FU) were randomized into groups I and II. Patients in group I (n = 42, 36 males, 6 females, 66.2 ± 10.6 years) underwent local treatment with ABMSC while those in group II (n = 54, control, 42 males, 12 females, 64.1 ± 8.6 years) received standard medical care. The frequency of major limb amputation in groups I and II was 21% and 44% within the 120 days of follow up, respectively (p < 0.05). Only in salvaged limbs of group I both toe pressure and toe brachial index increased (from 22.66 ± 5.32 to 25.63 ± 4.75 mmHg and from 0.14 ± 0.03 to 0.17 ± 0.03, respectively, mean ± SEM). The CD34(+) cell counts in bone marrow concentrate (BMC) decreased (correlation, p = 0.024) with age, even though there was no correlation between age and healing. An unexpected finding was made of relative, bone marrow lymphopenia in the initial bone marrow concentrates in patients who failed ABMSC therapy (21% of MLA). This difference was statistically significant (p < 0.040). We conclude ABMSC therapy results in 79% limb salvage in patients suffering from CLI and FU. In the remaining 21% lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia were identified as potential causative factors, suggesting that at least a partial correction with platelet supplementation may be beneficial.
