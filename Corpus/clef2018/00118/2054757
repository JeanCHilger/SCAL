End-to-end versus end-to-side proximal anastomosis in aortobifemoral bypass surgery: does it matter? The proximal anastomosis is still a controversial issue in vascular surgery. To compare end-to-end (EE) and end-to-side (ES) proximal anastomoses, the authors undertook a prospective study with 3 years' follow-up involving 120 patients, all of whom had aortobifemoral bypass. Fifty-one (42.5%) patients received the EE and 69 (57.5%) the ES anastomosis. The indications for surgery were abdominal aortic aneurysm (EE 51%, ES 0% p less than 0.05), claudication (EE 33.3%, ES 53.6%
