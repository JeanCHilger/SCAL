Quadricuspid morphology of the aortic valve. Quadricuspid aortic valve is a rare congenital heart defect. It may be isolated or associated to other cardiac anomalies. It may cause aortic valve dysfunction, commonly aortic regurgitation. Management of patients with quadricuspid aortic valve is represented by strict follow-up, because they may require aortic valve replacement in later life. We report the case of a 37-year old male patient, occasionally diagnosed to have quadricuspid aortic valve. Diagnosis and management are discussed.
