Late vascular damage after unilateral leg amputation. The higher incidence of infrarenal aortic aneurysms in war-veterans with above knee amputations indicates that leg amputation besides arteriosclerotic risk factors constitutes a relevant pathogenetic factor for the late development of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. A retrospective study of 25 mainly young patients with above knee amputation showed that already one year after leg-loss a typical adaptive narrowing of the pelvic and leg arteries with significant reduction of the flow volume of 37% on the amputated side could be registered. Unilateral flow reduction resp. interruption causes an asymmetric flow pattern at the aortic bifurcation. The changed hemodynamics are probably the main cause for late damage to the aorto-iliac vessels. The clinical importance of these results is that patients with unilateral leg amputation should have regular follow up investigation in order to detect late sequelae on the aorto-iliac vessels and to perform elective surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysm. Ipsilateral occlusive arterial disease as well as abdominal aortic aneurysms must be regarded as secondary late damage after leg amputation justifying obligatory indemnification.
