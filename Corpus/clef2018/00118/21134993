The role of postexercise measurements in the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease in HIV-infected patients. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a marker of atherosclerosis, which is not well studied in the population with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We prospectively enrolled HIV-infected patients who had normal resting ankle-brachial index (rABI) readings. All participants performed either a treadmill walking test (TT) or pedal plantar flexion test (PFT). Patients were divided into 2 groups according to postexercise changes PAD and No-PAD group. The 2 groups were compared with regard to established cardiovascular disease risk factors and other HIV infection parameters. Peripheral arterial disease was present in 30 (26.5%) of 113 consecutive HIV-infected patients included in the study. Mean age was 47 Â± 10 years. The risk factors studied did not differ significantly among the 2 groups except for male gender, which was significantly associated with PAD (RR: 4.15
