Risk factors associated with early hepatic artery thrombosis after orthotopic liver transplantation - univariable and multivariable analysis. Hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) is a serious complication in patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). It is associated with a high graft loss and mortality rate. In this study, possible risk factors associated with early HAT (occurring within the first postoperative month) were evaluated using univariable and multivariable analyses. Nine-hundred-and-fourteen consecutive OLTs in our institution were examined by univariable and multivariable analyses. Early HAT occurred in 43 patients (4.7%). Graft number, abnormal donor arterial anatomy, bench arterial reconstruction, aortic conduit use, multiple anastomoses, reperfusion time (interval between portal vein reperfusion and restoration of arterial flow) and the number of units of blood received intraoperatively were significantly associated with early HAT in the univariable analysis(P<0.1). These variables were included in a multivariable regression model which showed that bench arterial reconstruction was associated with a fourfold risk of early HAT(P<0.0001), whereas each additional 10min delay in reperfusion was associated with a 27% increase in the risk of early HAT (P<0.04). The main risk factors associated with early HAT are abnormal arterial anatomy in the graft requiring bench reconstruction and a delay in arterial reperfusion. Early recognition of these factors, strict surveillance protocols with arterial Doppler and selective anticoagulation for patients at risk need to be evaluated prospectively.
