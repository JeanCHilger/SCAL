Arch and visceral/renal debranching combined with endovascular repair for thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. We report a single-center experience using the hybrid procedure, consisting of open debranching, followed by endovascular aortic repair, for treatment of arch/proximal descending thoracic/thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA).From 2005 to 2010, 51 patients (33 men mean age, 70 years) underwent a hybrid procedure for arch/proximal descending thoracic/TAAA. The 30-day and in-hospital morbidity and mortality rates, and late endoleak, graft patency, and survival were analyzed. Graft patency was assessed by computed tomography, angiography, or duplex ultrasound imaging.Hybrid procedures were used to treat 27 thoracic (16 arch, 11 proximal descending thoracic) and 24 TAAA (Crawford/Safi types I to III: 3 type IV: 12The hybrid procedure is associated with acceptable rates of mortality and paraplegia when used for treatment of arch/proximal descending thoracic/TAAA. These results support this procedure as a reasonable approach to a difficult surgical problem however, longer follow-up is required to appraise its ultimate clinical utility.
