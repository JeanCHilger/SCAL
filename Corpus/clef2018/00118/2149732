Blood flow analysis in the left coronary artery in a patient with annulo-aortic-ectasia before and after Bentall's operation. It has not been established that Bentall's operation induces beneficial effect on a coronary circulation in a patient with Annulo-Aortic-Ectasia. Availability of a small subselective coronary Doppler catheter makes it possible to study the effects of the operation on coronary circulation. In a 49 year old man with Annulo-Aortic-Ectasia, phasic coronary flow velocity in the left main truncus was measured using a 3F steerable Doppler catheter (DC-101, Millar Inc.) pre- and postoperatively with assessment of vasodilator reserve capacity of individual coronary arteries. After the operation, the velocity wave form in the LMT changed to a diastolic-predominant normal pattern with a relatively small systolic component. That is, Bentall's operation caused a marked reduction of systolic- to diastolic flow component ratio from 0.32 to 0.19. The postoperative coronary flow configuration in the LMT was characterized by the presence of predominant diastolic spike. It coincided with "Water hammer wave" in the aortic pressure tracings caused by sudden closing of mechanical valve leaflets. Preoperative intracoronary papaverine increased the ratio of peak to resting velocity (coronary flow reserve) to 2.0 times at the rest, and 3.0 times after the operation. These results suggest that Bentall's operation seems to induce beneficial effect on the myocardial coronary circulation.
