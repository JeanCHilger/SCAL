"Inflammatory aneurysm" of the aorta. Diagnosis, therapy, results. From 1970 to 1987 among 964 patients with aortic aneurysms 52 (5.4%) underwent aortic graft replacement for inflammatory aortic aneurysm. 79.2% were symptomatic, 18.9% ruptured at the time of admission. CT-scan is of main diagnostic value. The perioperative mortality rate was 15.1%. At follow-up (28 months mean) 35 of 38 living patients (92.7%) were examined clinically, by sonography and in most cases by CT-scan. The late complication rate was 20% (n = 7, atrophic kidney 3, anastomotic aneurysms 4). In contrast to abdominal aortic aneurysms inflammatory aneurysms present an elevated morbidity and mortality rate which has to be reduced by exact preoperative diagnosis and modified surgical technique.
