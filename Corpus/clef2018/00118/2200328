Aortic aneurysms--who should do them? All patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs in a district general hospital between 1 January 1983 and 31 December 1987 were reviewed. Of the 76 cases, 53 were planned and 23 were ruptured aneurysms. The male:female ratio was 4.4:1, and the age range was 47-84 years (mean 67.6 +/- 6.97 years). Half underwent an ultrasound scan, showing a maximum diameter range of 3-12 cm. Fifty-seven (75%) had tube grafts, and 19 (25%) bifurcation grafts. The 30-day mortality was 3.7% for planned cases, and 26% for ruptured cases. The principal operator in 55 (72.5%) cases was a consultant consultant anaesthetists were involved in 61.3% cases. We conclude that aneurysm surgery can safely be performed in a district general hospital by a general surgeon with an interest in vascular surgery.
