Isolated eyeball metastasis of non-seminomatous germ cell testicular tumor. Testicular tumors most frequently metastasize to regional lymph nodes. Non-seminomatous tumor metastasis of testicle (NSGCTT) to the eyeball is rare.We presented a 24-year old man, referred to the ophthalmologist due to acute pain and abrupt loss of sight in the left eye accompanied by its enlargement. Orbital and endocranial computerized tomography (CT) was carried out, indicating the tumor in the left eye. His previous medical history provided the information that the right testicle was painlessly enlarged for 8 months. Ultrasonography showed a completely tumorously altered testis. Abdominal and chest CT failed to reveal any secondary deposits in visceral organs and lymph glands. Tumor markers (AFP - alpha-fetoproteins, beta hCG - human choronic gonadotropin beta) were elevated. Right radical orchiactomy was performed (showed NSGCTT), followed by polychemotherapy with cisplatinum 100 mg/m2, etoposide 120 mg/m2, bleomycin 15 mg/m2 (PEB x 4), resulting in normalization of tumor marker values and significant regression of the left eyeball. Next, the left eye enucleation and ocular prosthesis implantation was carried out. Pathohistological evaluation indicated fibrosis and necrosis only. In a 5-year follow-up period, the patient was free of recurrence.Isolated hematogenous metastasis of the NSGCTT to the eye is rare. In our case, the left eye was the only metastatic localization. After chemotherapy and eye enucleation the patient was in a 4-year follow-up period free of the recurrence.
