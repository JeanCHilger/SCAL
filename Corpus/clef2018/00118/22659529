Cardio-ankle vascular index in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. The cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) is a new non-invasive marker of arterial stiffness and atherosclerosis. The purpose of this study was to compare CAVI in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and in healthy controls.82 FH subjects (27 males, 65 females), aged 53.7±13.6 years without clinical symptoms of cardiovascular diseases and 359 healthy controls (121 males, 238 females), aged 43.9±14.9 years, were examined. CAVI was measured using the system VaSera® 1500.CAVI in FH patients was significantly higher (8.0±1.4) than in healthy subjects (7.5±1.3) p = 0.002 however, age, sex and BMI adjusted CAVI did not differ significantly (p = 0.061) between the FH group (7.5, CI: 7.3The study showed no significant difference in CAVI between heterozygous FH and healthy controls.
