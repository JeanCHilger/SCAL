Angioplasty and stent treatment of transplant renal artery stenosis. Transplant renal artery stenosis is a major complication that requires a therapeutic approach involving surgery or angioplasty. The aim of this study was to analyse the evolution of renal transplant patients with renal allograft artery stenosis treated by angioplasty and stent placement. Thirteen patients were diagnosed with transplant renal artery stenosis. Clinical suspicion was based on deterioration of renal function and/or poorly controlled hypertension with compatible Doppler ultrasound findings. The diagnosis was confirmed by arteriography, performing an angioplasty with stent placement during the same operation. A progressive improvement in renal function was observed during the first 3 months after the angioplasty, and renal function then remained stable over 2 years. In addition, blood pressure improved during the first 2 years, and as a consequence there was no need to increase the average number of anti-hypertensive drugs administered (2.5 drugs per patient). In conclusion, angioplasty with stent placement is a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of transplant renal artery stenosis.
