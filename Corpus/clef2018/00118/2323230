A case of delayed postoperative cardiac tamponade with unusual echocardiographic findings. Postoperative cardiac tamponade due to localized compression of the atria occurred in a 64-year-old man after aortic valve replacement and repair of an ascending aortic dissection. The clinical findings were subtle and the echocardiographic findings were unusual. Color Doppler flow imaging assisted in making the diagnosis of localized atrial compression.
