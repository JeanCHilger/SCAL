The sandwich technique to treat complex aortoiliac or isolated iliac aneurysms: results of midterm follow-up. To ascertain midterm outcomes of the sandwich technique (ST) for internal iliac artery endorevascularization (ER).All consecutive patients with complex aortoiliac aneurysms, isolated common iliac artery aneurysms, and abdominal aortic aneurysms with bilateral short, nondiseased common iliac artery undergoing elective endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) with the ST at our center, between October 2008 and March 2011, were invited to participate in the present study. Patients were considered eligible for this procedure only when their aneurysm features did not fulfill the requirements for standard EVAR. Follow-up assessments were carried out at 1 month and every 6 months thereafter and included computed tomographic angiography or duplex ultrasound. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board, and all patients gave written informed consent.A cohort of 40 patients (95% male mean age, 72.2 years) was followed over a mean follow-up period of 12 Â± 4.4 months (range: 6-30 months)The ST expands the limits of EVAR for complex aortoiliac aneurysms or IIAA in a safe, easy to perform, and cost-effective manner.
