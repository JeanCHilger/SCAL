Association between advanced age and vascular disease in different arterial territories: a population database of over 3.6 million subjects. This study sought to determine the relationship between vascular disease in different arterial territories and advanced age.Vascular disease in the peripheral circulation is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. There is little data to assess the prevalence of different phenotypes of vascular disease in the very elderly.Over 3.6 million self-referred participants from 2003 to 2008 who completed a medical and lifestyle questionnaire in the United States were evaluated by screening ankle brachial indices <0.9 for peripheral artery disease (PAD), and ultrasound imaging for carotid artery stenosis (CAS) >50% and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) >3 cm. Participants were stratified by decade of life. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds of disease in different age categories.Overall, the prevalence of PAD, CAS, and AAA, was 3.7%, 3.9%, and 0.9%, respectively. Prevalence of any vascular disease increased with age (40 to 50 years: 2%, 51 to 60 years: 3.5%, 61 to 70 years: 7.1%, 71 to 80 years: 13.0%, 81 to 90 years: 22.3%, 91 to 100 years: 32.5% p < 0.0001). Prevalence of disease in each vascular territory increased with age. After adjustment for sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index, family history of cardiovascular disease, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and exercise, the odds of PAD (odds ratio [OR]: 2.14There is a dramatic increase in the prevalence of PAD, CAS, and AAA with advanced age. More than 20% and 30% of octogenarians and nonagenarians, respectively, have vascular disease in at least 1 arterial territory.
