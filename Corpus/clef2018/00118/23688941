A novel strategy of vascular reconstruction after radical resection of an inferior vena cava leiomyosarcoma. Vascular reconstruction after resection of a inferior vena cava (IVC) leiomyosarcoma remains a major challenge. In this study we describe a case of successful vascular reconstruction using a novel approach.A patient underwent the surgical resection of an IVC tumor. The caudal stump of the IVC was then anastomosed to an 18-mm Dacron graft with bilateral 8-mm arms, which were anastomosed to the bilateral renal veins, respectively.Complete resolution of abdominal pain was achieved and the patient did well throughout the 12-month follow-up. No recurrent clinical symptoms were observed. Renal function was well maintained.This novel vascular reconstruction approach may be a feasible, effective surgical strategy for preservation of renal function for IVC leiomyosarcoma.
