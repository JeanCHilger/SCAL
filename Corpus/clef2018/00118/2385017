Elective prosthetic valve reoperation to relieve unacceptably high gradient. Pressure gradients of Lillehei-Kaster valve (13 patients), Omniscience valve (26 patients) and Omnicarbon valve (7 patients) in the aortic position were evaluated by Doppler echocardiography. Twenty-three out of 46 patients revealed unacceptably high gradients. Seven prostheses were removed because the valve design that they had high gradients across them. Clinical findings including left ventricular function and symptoms improved after the reoperation. Patients who underwent aortic valve replacement with this series of valve prostheses should be followed up cautiously.
