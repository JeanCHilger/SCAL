Hybrid treatment of a post-EVAR aortoenteric fistula. This report presents a case of secondary aortoenteric fistula after endovascular aortic repair in a fragile patient: The fistula developed due to aneurysm shrinkage and remodeling of the stent graft, resulting in a kink eroding through the aneurysm wall into the duodenum. The aortoenteric fistula was successfully treated with a hybrid procedure with endovascular aortic repair, followed by open enteroraphy and omental flap coverage of the stent graft and local antibiotic irrigation. Despite the presence of the stent graft in a previously infected field, the patient has recovered from the acute event with no septic recurrence or hemorrhage during four years of follow-up.
