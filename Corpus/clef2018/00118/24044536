Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms has a positive clinical effect. In Denmark 2-3% of men aged 65 years or more die from abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). The lethality of ruptured AAA is 75%, while the risk of preventive surgery is 2-3%. Ultrasonographic screening for AAA is fast, safe and reliable. Randomized trials show that screening halves the mortality from AAA, and reduces total mortality by 2%. The latest health economic study concludes that it is highly cost-effective to screen 65-year-old Danish men, as a quality-adjusted life year can be gained for about 5,100 DKK (555 GBP). This is less than one tenth of the recently approved Danish colorectal cancer-screening programme.
