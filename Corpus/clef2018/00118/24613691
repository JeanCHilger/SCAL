Pilot safety study of perivascular injection of tissue-engineered allogeneic aortic endothelial cells in patients undergoing minimally invasive peripheral revascularization. Restenosis is a limitation of endovascular interventions performed in the superficial femoral artery (SFA). Preclinical studies have demonstrated that the perivascular delivery of tissue-engineered allogeneic aortic endothelial cells (PVS-10200) reduced stenosis in porcine models of SFA revascularization. The purpose of this study was to investigate the safety and feasibility of percutaneous PVS-10200 delivery after angioplasty and stenting in the SFA of patients with peripheral artery disease.In this phase I open-label trial, 21 patients (average lesion length of 10.10 ± 2.36 cm and ≥70% stenosis) were treated with PVS-10200: 11 in a low-dose cohort (cohort A) and 10 in a high-dose cohort (cohort B). The primary objective was to demonstrate the safety (incidence of major adverse events) of PVS-10200 within 4 weeks after surgery. Secondary end points included assessments of resting ankle-brachial index (ABI) in the treated leg, Fontaine class, and time to target lesion revascularization (TLR).No patient had a major adverse event within 4 weeks. One patient required a limb amputation at 30 weeks. At 48 weeks, cohort A and cohort B patients maintained a 37% and 62% increase in ABI compared with baseline, respectively 70% of cohort A and 78% of cohort B improved by ≥1 Fontaine classification stage, and the TLR rate was 39% for cohort A and 20% for cohort B.Percutaneous local delivery of PVS-10200 is a well-tolerated and novel therapeutic approach that may be a suitable treatment for patients after endovascular intervention of the SFA. Larger randomized trials are needed to determine if PVS-10200 can improve ABI and reduce TLR rates.
