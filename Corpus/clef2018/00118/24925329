Multimodality imaging of aortitis. Multimodality imaging of aortitis is useful for identification of acute and chronic mural changes due to inflammation, edema, and fibrosis, as well as characterization of structural luminal changes including aneurysm and stenosis or occlusion. Identification of related complications such as dissection, hematoma, ulceration, rupture, and thrombosis is also important. Imaging is often vital for obtaining specific diagnoses (i.e., Takayasu arteritis) or is used adjunctively in atypical cases (i.e., giant cell arteritis). The extent of disease is established at baseline, with associated therapeutic and prognostic implications. Imaging of aortitis may be useful for screening, routine follow up, and evaluation of treatment response in certain clinical settings. Localization of disease activity and structural abnormality is useful for guiding biopsy or surgical revascularization or repair. In this review, we discuss the available imaging modalities for diagnosis and management of the spectrum of aortitis disorders that cardiovascular physicians should be familiar with for facilitating optimal patient care.
