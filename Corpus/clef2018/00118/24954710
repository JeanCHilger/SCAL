Conservative management of a prosthetic valve thrombosis--report of a successful case. Prosthetic valve thrombosis (PVT) refers to the presence of non infective material in valvular apparatus, interfering with its function. It is a potentially fatal complication of valvular replacement surgery. Treatment options include surgery, fibrinolysis and anticoagulation optimisation. The authors present the case of a young man, carrier of an aortic prosthetic mechanical valve, who didn't take his anticoagulant medicine, admitted for an acute obstructive PVT, with evidence of a large thrombotic mass on the aortic valve (> 1cm(2)). The patient refused surgical treatment and eventually presented a complete resolution of the acute PVT with anticoagulation optimisation.
