Uncovered stent implantation in complicated acute aortic dissection type B. To retrospectively evaluate the technical feasibility and midterm results of uncovered thoracoabdominal stent placement in complicated acute aortic dissection Stanford type B (cAADB).Fourteen consecutive patients (3 females range, 44-71 years) with cAADB who had symptomatic gastrointestinal malperfusion and claudication underwent immediate uncovered stent implantation (diameter, 7-28 mmStenting resulted in elimination of gastrointestinal ischemia and symptoms in 13 of 14 patients persisting symptoms led to secondary surgical revascularization in only 1 patient. More than 1 stent (â‰¤ 4) was placed in 7 patients (2 celiac, 1 mesenteric, 2 renal, 8 aorto-iliac). Follow-up computed tomographic angiography (CTA) revealed collapse of 4 aortic stents (diameter, 9-25 mmAcute aortic dissection with suspicion of visceral ischemia should prompt for immediate intervention. Thoracoabdominal uncovered stent implantation is a technically feasible and effective minimally invasive approach that provided successful relief of acute visceral ischemia and claudication in cAADB. Stent size should be less than the normal aortic diameter to avoid possible stent collapse.
