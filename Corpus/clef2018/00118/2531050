Balloon angioplasty of aortic coarctation: a review. Since the initial report of balloon coarctation angioplasty in 1982, several workers used this technique in native coarctation and postoperative recoarctation. Immediate and intermediate-term follow-up results are generally good with a small chance for recoarctation and aneurysmal formation at the site of coarctation. The causes of recoarctation were identified and include age less than 1 year, isthmus hypoplasia, and a small coarcted aortic segment. Despite good immediate and follow-up results, recommendations for use of balloon angioplasty as a treatment procedure of choice are clouded by the reports of development of aneurysms at the site of coarctation. We feel that balloon coarctation angioplasty is the treatment of choice in neonates and small infants, while general use of this technique in both native and postoperative coarctations in older children should await follow-up results in larger numbers of children at selected centers.
