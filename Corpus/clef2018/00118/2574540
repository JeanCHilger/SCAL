Pressor responses in conscious rats with chronic portal venous hypertension. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and vascular conductance responses to graded phenylephrine (PE) infusions were compared in conscious, unrestrained portal vein-stenosed (PS), and sham-operated (SO) rats chronically instrumented for pulsed Doppler flowmetry. Ten days after stenosis, MAP was lower in PS than in SO, and PS heart rates were higher. Pressor sensitivity to PE was attenuated 70%, and bradycardic responses to increases in MAP were 47% greater in PS. Abdominal aorta vascular bed conductance sensitivity was reduced 84%, and renal artery sensitivity was reduced 29% in PS compared with SO, whereas the superior mesenteric artery conductance response was unaffected by portal vein stenosis. After ganglionic blockade, the heart rate of PS remained greater than that of SO, and comparisons of renal artery, abdominal aorta, and superior mesenteric artery vascular conductances revealed no significant differences in neurogenic vascular tone. Differences between PS and SO pressor responses were abolished by ganglionic blockade, as were differences in vascular bed conductance responses. These findings suggest that a greater bradycardic response and greater baroreflex-mediated withdrawal of sympathetic tone from skeletal muscle and renal vascular beds were responsible for the decreased pressor sensitivity observed in PS animals.
