Walking ability and ankle systolic pressures: observations in patients with intermittent claudication in a short-term walking exercise program. Walking ability and limb hemodynamics were studied in 56 patients with intermittent claudication in an exercise program. Patients walked 1 hour 3 times a week for 3 to 6 months. Ankle and brachial pressures were measured at rest and after a standard walk, and walking ability on the treadmill and during free walking was determined. Average maximal distance on the treadmill increased from 0.59 to 1.00 km after training (p less than 0.0001). Also, after training 84% of patients were able to walk continuously more than 2 km without severe discomfort. The attained walking ability of individual patients could not be predicted from pressure measurements. Small pressure changes after training suggested that factors other than increased development of collateral vessels were important in determining walking ability. Practically useful walking ability was achieved in patients with aortoiliac and femoropopliteal arterial obstruction in the presence or absence of coronary disease and in patients taking beta-blockers. The results indicate that walking exercise is a valuable treatment for many patients with claudication who are not candidates for arterial reconstruction.
