Crossover chimney technique to preserve the internal iliac artery during endovascular repair of iliac or aortoiliac aneurysms: midterm results. To report our midterm results of the crossover chimney technique to preserve the internal iliac artery (IIA) in patients with aortoiliac aneurysms (AIA) and isolated common iliac artery aneurysms (CIAA).Between May 2012 and January 2014, 14 consecutive patients (mean age 77.3 years all men) with 17 AIA, isolated CIAAs, or abdominal aortic aneurysms with short CIAs underwent elective endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) with the crossover chimney technique to preserve the IIA. Follow-up assessment, including computed tomographic angiography or duplex ultrasound, was performed at 1, 6, and 12 months and annually thereafter.Technical success, defined as successful preservation of IIA without intraoperative type I or III endoleak, was 100%. Over a mean 14.3 months (range 6-21), primary patency was 92.8%. There was no early or late procedure-related mortality. Among the 17 iliac aneurysms excluded, the sac diameter significantly (at least 5 mm) decreased in 3, decreased <5 mm in 10, and did not change in 4.The crossover chimney technique is a simple and safe alternative for IIA endovascular revascularization with high technical success and acceptable midterm patency.
