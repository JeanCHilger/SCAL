The ischaemic leg: a long-term follow-up with special reference to the predictive value of the systolic digital blood pressure. Part II: After arterial reconstruction. Ninety-five patients with 122 legs with a systolic blood pressure on the big toe below 30 mmHg were the subject of arterial reconstructive surgery. Investigating the limb survival rate we found the systolic blood pressure on the big toe to be the most important predictor, whereas there was found no predictive value of the ankle pressure/index. Preoperative clinical symptoms, which are closely related to the digital blood pressure, were significant predictors of the limb survival rate: the low-pressure limb with no symptoms or intermittent claudication had a significantly higher survival rate than the limb with rest pain and/or gangrene. Following arterial reconstructive surgery the social fate of patients with threatened legs was fairly good as 83% became fully independent.
