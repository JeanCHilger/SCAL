Editor's Choice--First Results of the Covered Endovascular Reconstruction of the Aortic Bifurcation (CERAB) Technique for Aortoiliac Occlusive Disease. In this study the first results are presented of a new endovascular technique using covered stents to reconstruct the aortic bifurcation in patients with aortoiliac occlusive disease. With the "Covered Endovascular Reconstruction of the Aortic Bifurcation" (CERAB) technique, the anatomy and physiology of the aortic bifurcation is mimicked.Between 2009 and March 2014, 103 patients (51 male, 52 female) suffering from obstructive lesions at the level of the aortic bifurcation were treated with CERAB in two clinics. The median age was 61 years (range 36-85 years). Lesion morphology was evaluated by CT angiography. Six TASC-II B lesions, nine TASC-II C lesions, and 88 TASC-II D lesions were treated. Follow up was a median 12 months (range 0-49 months) and consisted of clinical examination, ankle brachial indices, and duplex ultrasound examination.Technical success was obtained in 98 procedures (95.1%). In five cases lesions could not be recanalized. Primary patency was 87.3% at 1 year and 82.3% at 2 years, while secondary patency was 95.0% at 1 year and 95.0% at 2 years. Mean ankle brachial indices improved significantly from 0.64 ± 0.21 before to 0.91 ± 014, after the procedure (p < .001). The overall 30 day complication rate was 23.3%, including 22 minor complications and two major complications (1.9%). There was no 30 day mortality. Median hospital stay was 2 days (range 1-16 days).The CERAB technique appears to be a safe and feasible alternative to open surgical reconstruction of the aortic bifurcation in complex occlusive disease. Comparative studies with the current gold standards are indicated.
