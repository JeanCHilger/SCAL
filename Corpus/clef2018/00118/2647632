Flow pattern and structural changes at carotid bifurcation in hypertensive cynomolgus monkeys. Blood flow pattern and morphological changes within the extracranial carotid system were studied in M. fascicularis before, immediately after, and at various intervals (4 hours, 4 days, 10 days, and 4 weeks) after the introduction of systemic hypertension by surgical coarctation of the thoracic aorta. Intra-arterial hemodynamics were assessed by means of both continuous-wave Doppler signal spectrum analysis and multigate pulsed-wave Doppler flow velocity profile processing. Diminished peak frequencies throughout the carotid system and enlargement of the lumen diameter in the common carotid artery and the carotid bulb were major findings and were suspected to be due to cerebral autoregulation at high levels of intracranial vascular resistance. In the internal carotid artery of pure muscular type, the lumen diameter was diminished so the carotid bulb became an area of structural and hemodynamic transition. As a consequence, flow irregularities already observed in this region before surgery considerably increased during hypertension. In addition, endothelial disarray and leucocytic adherence and activation were associated with these hemodynamic alterations within the carotid bulb. Their mutual role in early atherogenesis is discussed.
