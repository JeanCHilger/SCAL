What is the evidence to support screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm and what is the role of the primary care physicians ?. Abdominal aortic aneurysm is a serious and potentially fatal vascular disease. Surgical intervention is typically reserved for aneurysms 55 mm in diameter or greater. Randomized trials addressing the efficacy of ultrasound screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm have shown that screening reduced aneurysm-related mortality in men but not in women who have a lower prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysm. Screening with ultrasonography is recommended in men 65 to 75 years of age with a history of smoking and is suggested in women in this age group if they have risk factors such as smoking and hypertension. Men and women with a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm should undergo screening as well. Persons who have a stable aneurysm should undergo regular surveillance or operative intervention depending on aneurysm size. Primary care physicians have to play a key role before prescribing screening in assessing risks and benefits of repair in each patient. For persons with an aneurysm of less than 55 mm in diameter, the primary care physicians should provide information and interventions for the prevention of cardiovascular disease such as screening for and treating hypertension and interventions for tobacco cessation for smokers. The family physicians should also ensure that radiological monitoring of aneurysms is complete.
