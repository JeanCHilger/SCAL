Effect of buflomedil chlorhydrate on local oxygen delivery in peripheral vascular disease. Modifications in transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2), induced by the administration of 3 mg/kg/day buflomedil chlorhydrate for seven days were evaluated in 12 subjects suffering from peripheral vascular disease (PVD). After the treatment a significant increase in TcPO2 basal values was observed in Stage III and Stage IV PVD patients (+32.2%) while a significant reduction of 12% in the half-recovery time to basal values after an induced ischemia was recorded in Stage II PVD patients by the seventh day. Buflomedil did not, however, cause any significant variations in the ankle/arm pressure ratio or in the plethysmographic peak flow.
