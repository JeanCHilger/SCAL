Role of revascularization to treat chronic nonhealing fractures in ischemic limbs. The contribution of chronic limb ischemia to long-term nonunion of a lower extremity fracture was suggested in a single published case report from our group 13 years ago. We have since encountered three additional patients with nonunited lower extremity fractures occurring in limbs with arterial ischemia. In each of these four patients limb revascularization was undertaken in an effort to stimulate healing of the fracture. These patients had chronic (mean 6 months) nonunion of tibial (three) or femur (one) fractures associated with severe lower extremity ischemia (ankle/brachial index m = 0.33 range 0.24 to 0.5). All patients had histories of chronic lower extremity ischemia before the fracture (ischemic rest pain, 2
