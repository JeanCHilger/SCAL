Significance of the use of glycerol trinitrate in functional angiologic diagnosis. On 95 patients functional rheographic investigations and pressure measurements of the arteries of the big toes were carried out before and after the administration of glycerol trinitrate. Using the nitrate-induced decrease of the tone of the vessels persons with healthy vessels could more certainly be differed from patients with organic arterial occlusive disease of the lower extremities stage I and IIa. Despite the administration of glycerol trinitrate the rheography, however, does not reach the extraordinarily high reliability of the ultrasound-Doppler-pressure measurement in the early diagnosis of the arterial occlusive disease.
