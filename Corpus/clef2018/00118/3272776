Avoidance of retrograde catheterization by Doppler echocardiographic diagnosis of Björk-Shiley aortic valve dysfunction. A 74-year-old man with a history of prior Björk-Shiley aortic valve replacement was admitted with chest pain and dyspnea. Results of physical examination and cinefluoroscopy suggested a dysfunction of the prosthetic valve imaging echocardiography was not helpful. Nonimaging continuous wave Doppler examination confirmed severe prosthetic aortic valve dysfunction, necessitating emergent replacement, and potentially hazardous retrograde catheterization of the prosthesis was avoided.
