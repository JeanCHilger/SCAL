Detection of stenoses in the internal carotid artery by waveform analysis of continuous wave ultrasound signals (II). Analysis of the morphological aspects of continuous-wave Doppler examination is a reliable means of detecting carotid stenosis involving 50% or more of the diameter of the arterial lumen. This study was undertaken to evaluate the indexes likely to increase the diagnostic accuracy of this noninvasive investigation method. The indexes studied were the variations of the maximal frequency and the systolic peak frequencies, measured proximal to and at the level of stenosis, and the ratio of the systolic peak frequency measured in the internal carotid artery and in the common carotid artery. After obtaining data on an experimental model, the study was conducted in healthy volunteers (n = 24) and in patients with carotid atherosclerotic disease (n = 23). The experimental study confirmed that stenosis greater than 50% leads to a reduction of blood flow and that there is a mathematical relationship between the frequency measured proximal to and at the level of the stenosis and the degree of stenosis. Clinical data showed that there was a significant decrease in the frequency of the systolic peak in elderly "healthy" subjects as compared with younger subjects. However there was no difference between patients with and without stenosis. The index was 0.8 in young subjects, 1.3 in healthy elderly subjects, and greater than 1.3 in subjects who had a stenosis. There was no statistically significant difference between these two last groups. At the threshold value of 2.3, the sensitivity of the FI index was 22% and the specificity was 94% in the detection of carotid artery stenosis. In the assessment of the tight stenosis, sensitivity was 44%.
