Ruptured aneurysm of sinus of Valsalva. Long-term postoperative follow-up. Ruptured sinus Valsalva aneurysm was repaired in 13 patients (mean age c. 33 years). Dyspnea, chest pain, fatigue and palpitation were the most common symptoms and systodiastolic murmur, cardiomegaly and pulmonary congestion the most pertinent clinical findings. The pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio averaged c. 2.5. Associated cardiac anomalies were ventricular septal defect, aortic or mitral regurgitation, aortic coarctation or subvalvular stenosis, tetralogy of Fallot (altogether 8 cases). The origin of the fistula was the noncoronary, right coronary or left coronary sinus (5, 4 and 3 cases) or was not identifiable (1 case). Rupture occurred into the right atrium (6 cases), right ventricle (6) or pulmonary artery (1 case). Repair was undertaken through aortotomy (6 cases), right ventriculotomy (2) or right atriotomy (1) or through aortotomy + right ventriculotomy or atriotomy (4). In one case aortic valve replacement was performed. All survived the operation. Follow-up averaged 9.6 years. Recurrent fistulation, though with small shunt, was found in two cases. Combined two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography revealed minor cardiac abnormalities in most patients, particularly aortic regurgitation. All the patients were in NYHA function class I or II.
