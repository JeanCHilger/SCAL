Magnetic resonance imaging of aortic aneurysm. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in 16 patients with aortic aneurysm used a field of 5,000 Gauss and spin echo multisection imaging with two echos. Results were compared retrospectively with those of echotomography, computed tomography and angiography. Surgical exploration allowed correlation with histopathology in 13 patients. The external diameter of aneurysm and of its residual lumen and length of aneurysm were in each case evaluated precisely by MR. In patients with abdominal aneurysm, MR images identified the limits of the aneurysm in relation to renal and iliac arteries. In aneurysms of thoracic aorta, synchronization of signal with an ECG and longitudinal imaging provided data on relations of aneurysm with supraaortic trunks. In 2 patients with extensive, partially thrombosed thoracic and abdominal aorta aneurysm, MR imaging could not eliminate a diagnosis of aortic dissection with thrombosed false lumen. Finally, aortic wall calcifications were never apparent on MR images.
