Doppler echocardiography in the evaluation of valvular heart disease. Doppler echocardiography is a relatively new non-invasive technique which provides direct hemodynamic data that is complementary to M-Mode and 2-Dimensional echocardiography. This technique allows measurement of peak flow velocity through a stenotic valve and allows accurate prediction of the pressure gradient across the valve. It is a promising technique for screening patients with suspected pulmonic and aortic stenosis. It allows quantitation of gradient and valve area in patients with mitral stenosis. Doppler techniques are also valuable in detecting and semi-quantitating valvular regurgitation. Pulsed Doppler echocardiography is accurate in evaluating patients with multi-valvular disease. Finally, Doppler techniques are finding an important role in the evaluation of suspected prosthetic valve malfunction. In summary, Doppler echocardiography offers a complementary approach for direct evaluation of intracardiac hemodynamics in patients with valvular heart disease.
