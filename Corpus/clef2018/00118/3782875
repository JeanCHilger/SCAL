Continuous wave Doppler echocardiographic assessment of prosthetic aortic valves. To assess the prosthetic aortic valve functions according to types and sizes of valves, the peak flow velocity was recorded by means of continuous wave Doppler echocardiography in 40 patients (age 45 +/- 15 years) with prosthetic aortic valves and in 25 normal subjects. Twenty-one patients had Bj√∂rk-Shiley valves (1-18 months after replacement) 12 had St. Jude Medical valves (6-48 months after replacement)
