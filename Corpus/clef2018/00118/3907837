Lymphocele around aortic femoral grafts simulating a false aneurysm. A 64-year-old female treated with a Dacron aortobifemoral graft for atherosclerotic vascular disease sought medical evaluation for abdominal pain 6 months later. Studies including ultrasound, radionuclide, angiography, and CT scan suggested a diagnosis of false aneurysm. Surgical intervention subsequently confirmed the diagnosis of lymphocele.
