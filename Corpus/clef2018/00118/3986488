Atypical claudication. In a prospective study the incidence, causes and management of atypical claudication have been investigated. All patients had a clinical assessment, Doppler ultrasound studies and X-rays of the lumbosacral spine, some had epidural injections, myelography with computerized axial tomography and arteriography. The incidence of atypical claudication was low, 13 per cent of all claudicants referred to our department, and although difficulties in diagnosis were encountered an approximately equal incidence of spinal and arterial causes was found. Only one patient had a definite central spinal stenosis. The need for invasive investigations was low (18 per cent) and even lower for surgery (7 per cent) the majority of patients' symptoms responded to conservative management.
