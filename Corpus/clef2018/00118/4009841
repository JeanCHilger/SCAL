Isolated profundaplasty for limb salvage. Fifty-four patients underwent 56 profundaplasties for limb salvage. All had stenosis greater than 50% in diameter of the deep femoral artery and associated superficial femoral artery occlusive disease. After profundaplasty, ischemic ulcers healed in 9 of 17 (53%) patients. Rest pain was relieved in 6 of 19 (32%) and areas of ischemic necrosis healed in 7 of 20 (35%). Cumulative patency of the deep femoral artery was 49% at 3 years but fell to 21% at 5 years, whereas cumulative limb salvage was 49% and 36%, respectively. Eleven of the required 28 amputations were performed in the immediate postoperative period. Profundaplasty was used to lower the amputation level and preserve the knee joint in six patients. The other five early amputations occurred in severely ischemic limbs without distal vessels suitable for bypass. The profundaplasty remained patent in all 19 patients who underwent below-knee amputation and 16 (84%) became ambulatory with a prosthesis. Hemodynamic data provided by determination of the profundapopliteal collateral index predicted limb salvage in 10 of 11 (91%) of limbs when the index value was less than or equal to 0.19. Other clinical criteria, such as preoperative ankle-brachial index and the presence of diabetes mellitus, had no predictive value. Isolated profundaplasty for limb salvage is an effective first procedure for selected patients and provides a reasonable alternative to primary amputation or high-risk distal bypass. When amputation is inevitable, effective perfusion of the profunda femoris artery is essential for preservation of the knee joint and results in a high degree of functional rehabilitation.
