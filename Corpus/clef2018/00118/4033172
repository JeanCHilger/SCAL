Experiences with the Carpentier techniques of mitral valve reconstruction in 103 patients (1980-1985). A total of 103 patients, age range 2 to 77 years, had some type of Carpentier reconstruction for mitral insufficiency. The mitral insufficiency resulted from ruptured chordae in 52, prolapse in 13, rheumatic fever in 16, coronary disease in eight, congenital disease in nine, and endocarditis in five. Multiple abnormalities were usually present. Four patients had severe calcification of the anulus. A reconstruction was accomplished in almost all patients. A ring annuloplasty was performed in all but two small children, but annuloplasty alone was adequate in only 17 patients. Fifty-eight had resection of 1 to 4 cm of diseased mitral leaflet. In 23 patients, chordal transposition or shortening was employed. Aortic leaflet repair was done in 28. Shortened, fused chordae (one to eight) were divided in 13 patients. Additional procedures performed in 28 patients included coronary bypass in 14. A successful repair was accomplished in all but one patient (moderate residual insufficiency). Two late hospital deaths were unrelated to the mitral repair. Following hospital discharge, ring dehiscence necessitated repeat operation in one patient. Thromboembolism produced a permanent minor neurological deficit in only one patient. There have been no late recurrences of insufficiency. Recurrent endocarditis necessitated valve replacement in three patients. A late Doppler evaluation of 95 patients for mitral insufficiency revealed none in 82, a trace in 12, and moderate insufficiency in one. Late catheterization in 16 patients revealed no insufficiency. The data suggest that reconstruction, rather than prosthetic valve replacement, can be successfully performed in over 90% of patients with nonrheumatic, noncalcified mitral valves. A much wider use of the technique seems strongly indicated.
