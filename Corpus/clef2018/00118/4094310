Index of regional systolic pressure--optimal test in the diagnosis of peripheral arterial insufficiency. Dopplerography was used to determine malleolar systolic pressure (MSP) and its derivatives, the brachiomalleolar gradient (BMG) and the melleolar systolic pressure index (MSPI), in 113 patients with chronic arterial insufficiency and varying degrees of ischemia. Thirty normal subjects were taken as controls. The MSPI and the BMG proved to be more informative in differentiating between normal and pathologic conditions, whereas the MSPI and the MSP were more indicative of the limb's viability.
