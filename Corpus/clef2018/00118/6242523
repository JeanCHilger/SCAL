Doppler waveform analysis and percutaneous dilatation of arteries in ischaemia of the lower limb. Percutaneous transluminal dilatation of narrowed atheromatous arteries using the inflatable Gruntzig catheter is becoming an accepted non-surgical treatment for patients with disabling intermittent claudication of the lower limb. The use of doppler ultrasound to study limb blood flow in a group of patients having aortic or iliac dilatation is described.
