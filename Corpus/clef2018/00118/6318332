Rupture of a dissecting aneurysm of the ascending aorta 10 years after therapy of coarctation. Apropos of a case of a 10-year-old girl. This is a rare but life-threatening association. After surgical repair of a coarctation, delayed aneurysm of the ascending aorta may occur, with dissection in some instances. The case we report exemplifies this possibility. Surgical repair is difficult. Data from the medical literature is consistent with the speculation that the aneurysm is not an acquired lesion above the coarctation but a distinct disease of the aortic wall which runs an independent course but which may be promoted by the arterial hypertension. The course and prognosis are so serious that, in spite of its low prevalence, patients should be screened at regular intervals for this condition by ultrasonography of the ascending aorta.
