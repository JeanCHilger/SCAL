Evaluation of venous hemodynamics as the decisive diagnostic criterion for venous surgery. The different physical screening tests (ultrasound Doppler technique, plethysmography, phlebodynamometry) are easy documented and make possible a less dangerous, less expensive, and extensive statement about the venous hemodynamics of the lower extremity. The quota of diagnostic error can be minimized and the indication for operation is secure.
