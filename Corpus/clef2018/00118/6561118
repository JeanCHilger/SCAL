Echographic follow-up of an abdominal aortic aneurysm treated with a prosthetic bypass. The history of a patient with two thoracoabdominal aneurysms and lumbar Pott's disease is reported. A bypass was implanted from the ascending to the abdominal aorta. In the postoperative course the patient experienced acute low back pain. Ultrasonography suggested patency of the vascular graft. Therefore the symptoms were attributed to the vertebral pathology, and so the correct treatment could be given. The utility of ultrasonography in the early postoperative course, when aortography is contraindicated, is stressed.
