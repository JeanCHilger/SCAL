In-vitro fluid dynamic characteristics of the abiomed trileaflet heart valve prosthesis. The need for better and longer lasting trileaflet valves has led to the design and development of the Abiomed polymeric trileaflet valve prosthesis. In-vitro fluid dynamic studies on sizes 25 and 21 mm valves in the aortic position indicate an overall improvement in performance compared to the Carpentier-Edwards and Ionescu-Shiley tissue valves in current clinical use. The pressure drop studies yielded effective orifice areas of 1.99 and 1.54 cm2, and performance indices of 0.41 and 0.45 for the Nos. 25 and 21 valves, respectively. Leaflet photography studies indicated that the two valve sizes had maximum opening areas of 225 and 145 mm2, respectively, at a normal resting cardiac output. Steady and pulsatile flow velocity measurements with a laser-Doppler anemometer (LDA) system indicate that the flow field downstream of the Abiomed valve is jetlike and turbulent. Maximum mean square axial velocity fluctuations of 55 and 83 cm/s, and turbulent shear stresses of 220 and 450 N/m2 were measured in the immediate vicinity of the nos. 25 and 21 valves, respectively. The Abiomed valves studied had been originally configured for use in valved conduits, and it is therefore our opinion that further improvements can be made to the valve and stent design, which would enhance its fluid dynamic performance.
