Sexual impotence of vascular etiology in arterial obstructive disease of the legs. In order to demonstrate the relationship between sexual impotence and penile-brachial index 142 patients with arteriosclerotic disease of the legs and 15 control patients have been studied. Penile-brachial index has been evaluated by Doppler ultrasound, while sexual impotence has been graded on the basis of clinical history. Patients with arteriosclerotic disease have been further divided into 2 groups: patients with normal sexual potence and patients with sexual impotence. Penile-brachial index resulted 0,87 +/- S.D. 0,16 in the former group, while it resulted 0,59 +/- S.D. 0,22 in the latter. The present data seem to suggest that in patients with arteriosclerotic disease of the legs a positive relationship exists between penile-brachial index greater than 0,80 and a normal sexual potence, while a penile-brachial index less than 0,60 strongly indicates the possibility that the main factor responsible for sexual impotence is vascular insufficiency.
