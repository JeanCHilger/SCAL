Doppler ultrasound diagnosis of complications of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft shunts. Doppler spectral analysis of PIFE graft shunts for haemodialysis was carried out in 20 patients. All shunts were functioning satisfactorily. One patient had severe oedema of the forearm and hand. In four of the 20 patients, stenosis of the venous anastomosis was diagnosed by Doppler examination. Retrograde venous flow in the ulnar vein at the wrist was seen in the patient with severe oedema. All patients underwent angiography and the diagnosis of stenosis and retrograde flow was confirmed. Graft arteriography has proved useful in detecting shunt lesions, but may be hazardous at the access site and for the patient. Doppler investigation in noninvasive and can detect shunt complications early and with great accuracy.
