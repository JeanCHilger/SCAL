Superiority of transcutaneous oximetry in noninvasive vascular diagnosis in patients with diabetes. Transcutaneous oxygen tension Ptco2 is directly related to skin oxygen delivery. Regional transcutaneous oximetry ( RTO ) compares peripheral and truncal (Ptco2), yielding a regional perfusion index indicative of local limb perfusion. The relative diagnostic values of RTO , Doppler ankle-brachial pressure ratio (ABR), pulse volume recording (PVR), and toe pulse reappearance time (PRT/2) were studied in 64 limbs of patients with diabetes. These limbs were clinically classifiable into claudication, rest pain, and gangrene groups. Regional transcutaneous oximetry had a higher diagnostic accuracy than ABR (X2 = 27.47, P less than .001), PVR (X2 = 7.54, P less than .01), and PRT/2 (X2 = 10.99, P less than .001). Regional transcutaneous oximetry was universally applicable and the degree of hypoxia observed correlated with clinical symptoms. Significant hypoxia predicted large-vessel angiographic lesions, many of which were reconstructible . Regional transcutaneous oximetry should be the initial noninvasive test in diabetic peripheral vascular disease.
