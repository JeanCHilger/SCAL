Artificial stenosis of the left vertebral artery in the rabbit. Animal experiments were carried out to clarify if a unilateral stenosis of the vertebral artery leads to a typical symptomatology and if a surgical therapy may be promising. The left vertebral artery was stenosed in 12 rabbits. The result was checked for 3 weeks electro-encephalographically and doppler-sonographycally. Conclusions after this long-term experiment: 1) A unilateral stenosis of the vertebral artery leads to a brain stem symptomatology. 2) This symptomatology shows determined development in dependence of the time. 3) Correlates of the brain stem lesion by vertebral stenosis were discovered electroencephalographically they were increased by specific activation methods. 4) The expected success produced the operative removal of the artificial stenosis of the vertebral artery. 5) The blood flow of the vessels which are of interest could be controlled by means of the ultrasound doppler-sonography during the whole experiment.
