Angiographic and echotomographic comparative evaluation of abdominal aortic aneurysm in 15 operated patients. The authors report the principle data resulting from the study of 43 patients presenting pulsating abdominal masses: 21 aneurysms of the aorta have been documented, and the comparative results between echography and angiography compared with operatory findings in 15 patients. With echography, reliable diagnostic precision regarding the form and dimensions of the aneurysmatic cavity is possible, and above all, the exclusion or confirmation of the presence of blood clots is allowed. The vascular situation, especially of the principle collateral branches, is better defined by aortography. Echography offers advantages not only in the survey of patients with high operation risk aneurysms, and other pulsating abdominal masses as well, but brings into evidence retroperitoneal fibrosis circumscribing the aneurysm. Last, it is preferable in the follow up of vascular prosthesis after surgery.
