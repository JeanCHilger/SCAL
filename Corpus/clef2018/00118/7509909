NG-monomethyl-L-ARG reduces the forearm vasodilator response to acetylcholine but not to methacholine in humans. We compared the contribution of nitric oxide (NO) in methacholine (MCh)- and acetylcholine (ACh)-induced vasodilation using the NO-synthase inhibitor NG-monomethyl-L-arginine acetate (L-NMMA-acetate) in two groups (A and B) of 6 healthy male volunteers. The left brachial artery was cannulated for drug infusion and recording of mean arterial pressure (MAP). Forearm blood flow (FBF) was measured on both sides by venous occlusion mercury-in-silastic strain-gauge plethysmography. All measurements were performed with occluded hand circulation. Forearm vasodilator response to three increasing dosages of MCh (0.03, 0.3, and 1 micrograms/100 ml forearm/min group A) or ACh (0.5, 2, and 8 micrograms/100 ml forearm/min
