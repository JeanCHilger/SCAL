Inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase ameliorates cerebral ischemic damage. We sought to determine whether expression of the inducible, calcium-independent isoform of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) contributes to the tissue damage produced by focal cerebral ischemia. The middle cerebral artery was occluded in halothane-anesthetized spontaneously hypertensive rats. Twenty-four hours later rats received intraperitoneal injections of the iNOS inhibitor aminoguanidine (100 mg/kg twice per day n = 10) or of aminoguanidine + L-arginine (300 mg/kg four times per day
