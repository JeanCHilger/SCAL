Assessment of abdominal aortic aneurysm with magnetic resonance imaging. Pre-operative imaging of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) is important in determining suitability for operation and operative approach. Ultrasound imaging is an excellent screening modality but is relatively poor at identifying renal arteries and the extent of iliac involvement. Computed tomography scanning with intravenous contrast and arteriography are invasive modalities that are associated with a small risk. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers the potential of accurate anatomical definition without use of contrast agents and passage of an intra-arterial catheter. Eight patients who had their AAA evaluated with MRI are reported. All had renal arteries accurately defined, intra-aneurysmal thrombosis was well delineated, and iliac extension was correctly identified in four cases. The initial experience has been most encouraging and the authors consider that MRI may become the investigation of choice for pre-operative AAA assessment.
