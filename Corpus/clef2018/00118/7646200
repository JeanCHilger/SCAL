Aortic valve replacement: is the stentless xenograft an alternative to the homograft? Early results of a randomized study. From November 1992 to October 1993 we randomized 101 patients over 60 years of age undergoing elective aortic valve replacement, with or without concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting, to receive either a cryopreserved aortic or pulmonary homograft (n = 38) or a stentless porcine aortic valve xenograft (Edwards Prima 2500) (n = 63). The majority of all valves (92%) were inserted freehand in the subcoronary position. Six homografts (16%) were implanted as a free-root replacement and two xenografts (3%) were used as a mini root. There were four in-hospital deaths (4%), three in the homograft group and one in the xenograft group (homograft, 7.9% versus xenograft, 1.6% p = not significant). Forty-one patients were followed at 3- to 6-month intervals for 9 +/- 2 months (3 to 14 months) and valve pathology was assessed routinely by means of color flow Doppler echocardiography. Two patients in the homograft group developed new aortic insufficiency grade II
