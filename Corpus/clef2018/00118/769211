Microvascular techniques for polar artery reconstruction in kidney transplants. The complications of ureteral ischemia make revascularization of polar vessels attractive in cadaver and live-related transplants. Thirty-two patients underwent reconstruction of polar vessels of 1.2 to 2.5 mm, in diameter after revascularization of the major vessels as follows: (1) inferior epigastric artery to polar artery, ten patients - six cadaver transplants, four living-related transplants (The vessels are spatulated and sutured precisely by microvascular techniques with Nos. 7-0 or 8-0 Tevdek) (2) polar vessel with a patch of aorta to iliac artery, one patient - living relative donor
