Surgical treatment of multistage occlusion of the abdominal aorta and iliac and femoral arteries. The results of surgical treatment of 26 patients with "multistage" occlusion, who underwent reconstructive operation on two segments (group 1), and 29 patients, who underwent ultrasound disobliteration of the femoral arteries together with the reconstructive operation (group 2), are presented. In group 1, a good immediate result was noted in 80.8%, a good long-term result--in 61.6%, in group 2--79.4 and 70.8% of the patients, respectively.
