Influence of sex on the results of abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Canadian Society for Vascular Surgery Aneurysm Study Group. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of sex on the survival rate and complications after repair of nonruptured and ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA).The Canadian Society for Vascular Surgery Aneurysm Registry formed the database for analysis and provided current, ongoing follow-up of the patients. Statistical methods included t tests, chi-squared analysis, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox regression analysis.Of the 679 patients undergoing repair of a nonruptured AAA, 19.7% were women and 82.3% men. The following risk factors were significantly different (p < 0.05) in women and men: women were older more had never smokedSex was not found to have an effect on the early or late results after repair of nonruptured or ruptured AAA. However, a literature review suggests the possibility of a gender bias in the diagnosis and/or selection of patients for surgical treatment because the proportion of women in surgical series is generally less than the proportion determined from autopsy studies, ultrasound studies, hospital discharge data, and national mortality information.
