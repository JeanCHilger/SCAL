PTFE prostheses in infrarenal aneurysms of the abdominal aorta. Postoperative dilatation of Dacron vascular grafts can lead to aneurysms and rupture of the prosthesis making it necessary to change the graft by operation. Therefore, 15 patients at LÃ¼beck University Hospital underwent replacement of the aorta with PTFE prostheses due to infrarenal aortic aneurysms. Ultrasound measurements 2-12 months postoperatively revealed a dilatation of 11.6% concerning tubular grafts, 11.5% for the shafts and 14.6% for the limbs of bifurcation grafts compared to the higher dilatation rate of Dacron prostheses described in the literature. There was no evidence of anastomotic false aneurysms, thrombosis of the limbs of bifurcation grafts, peripheral embolization or perigraft reaction. In conclusion, PTFE prostheses seem to be a means of preventing patients from having secondary complications as a result of graft dilatation. Based on our early results and the results described in the literature, PTFE prostheses can be regarded as an alternative to dacron prostheses.
