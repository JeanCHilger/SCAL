The original caliber of the carotid artery as a possible risk factor for complications of atherosclerosis. Seventy subjects (35 men, 35 women age range: 65 to 86 years) with an isolated 80% extracranial atherosclerotic stenosis of a single internal carotid artery were studied. Each subject was examined by color Doppler ultrasonography. The size of the carotids and the Doppler flow velocities of both healthy and diseases internal carotid arteries were measured. The original arterial calibers were also estimated, and the Doppler flow velocity was determined at the level of and proximal to the stenotic lesion. The symptomatology and occurrence of cerebrovascular events (territory and extent) were documented in all subjects with respect to the other parameters. By comparing the sizes of the common, internal, and external carotid arteries in every patient, it was observed that their calibers were consistently proportional to one another. In both the men and the women, significant, inversely proportional relationships were observed between the original vessel caliber and the extent of stenosis in the affected internal carotid artery, as well as between the original vessel caliber and the hemodynamic significance of the stenosis. Moreover, a correlation was observed among the original arterial caliber, the presence or absence of symptoms, and the frequency and extent of cerebrovascular events, in both the men and the women. In both sexes, the functional of the compensatory circulation was found to correlate with arterial caliber (p < 0.01). The correlation between the degree of stenosis and the gravity of the symptomatology, as well as the occurrence of cerebrovascular events, was observed to increase significantly when the residual luminal area (of the stenotic artery) was less than 2.5 mm2. This relationship tended to hold more for men than for women
