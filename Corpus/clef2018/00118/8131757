Doppler haemodynamic assessment of clinically and echocardiographically normal mitral and aortic Allcarbon valve prostheses. Valve Prostheses Ligurian Cooperative Doppler Study. Doppler echocardiographic characteristics of normally functioning Allcarbon prostheses were studied in 149 consecutive patients with 157 valves in the mitral (n = 73) and aortic (n = 84) positions whose function was considered normal by clinical and echocardiographic evaluation. In the mitral position, the mean gradient and the effective mitral orifice area were not significantly different in either the 25-mm or the 31-mm size valves (from 5 +/- 1 to 4 +/- 1 mmHg and from 2.2 +/- 0.6 to 2.8 +/- 0.9 cm2, respectively P = ns for both). Conversely, peak gradient was significantly and inversely correlated to actual orifice area (r = -0.70
