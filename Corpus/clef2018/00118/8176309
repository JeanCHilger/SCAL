A successful case report of coronary artery bypass grafting under ventricular fibrillation with circulatory arrest. Coronary artery bypass grafting in a 78-year-old female with severely calcified ascending aorta was performed successfully. Bilateral internal thoracic arteries and saphenous vein were anastomosed under ventricular fibrillation and hypothermia without aortic cross-clamping. Proxymal anastomosis of saphenous vein graft was performed directly under circulatory arrest in a normal part of ascending aorta which was confirmed by intraoperative ultrasonography. Weaning from ECC was easy and no neurological complication was observed after operation. Bypass grafts were patent on postoperative coronary angiogram and postoperative course was uneventful. We think the technique of circulatory arrest and intraoperative ultrasonography were useful in a patient with severely calcified ascending aorta.
