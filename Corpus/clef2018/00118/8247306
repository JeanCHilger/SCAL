Occult aneurysms of the abdominal aorta. Our echographic experience. The authors report their experience in evaluating abdominal aorta aneurysms (AAA) by ultrasound examination. The incidence of this kind of disease is growing up in the last years and an earlier diagnosis increases the surviving possibilities of the patient affected, above all if symptomless, leading to a correct treatment: a semestral or annual follow-up of the aneurysms with a diameter smaller than 5 cm and surgery of the aneurysms with a diameter wider than 5 cm, because of high risk of rupture. The authors stress the importance of extending abdominal ultrasound examination to the aorta in all patients over 50 year old especially if affected by vascular diseases, hypertension and diabetes. In their experience the authors found 106 AAA 61% of them with less than 4 cm diameter.
