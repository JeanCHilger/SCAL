The association between abdominal aortic aneurysms and chronic leg ischaemia. Prevalence in 125 consecutive patients. A study was carried out to see if in patients with atherosclerotic lesions of the lower limbs the percentage of abdominal aneurysms is higher than in the general population. One hundred twenty five consecutive patients were studied in two different hospitals and compared with a control group. In the two groups with peripheral vascular diseases the patients had a prevalence of aneurysms of 12%, while in the control group the prevalence was of 3%. All patients were operated on successfully except two of them who are now in follow up with regular ultrasound assessment, one with an aortic aneurysm of 3.2 cm and the other with an aortic diameter of 4 cm and moderate liver failure.
