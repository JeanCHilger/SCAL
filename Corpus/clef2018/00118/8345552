Duplex ultrasonography of superior mesenteric artery: interobserver variability. The aim of this study was to evaluate the interobserver variability during duplex ultrasonographic investigation of the SMA. Eleven healthy volunteers were examined twice under the same conditions by two independent observers. Three basic Doppler wave parameters were assessed for the SMA: pV, edV, and rT. The tD was recorded for SMA and abdominal aorta (AotD) with B-mode imaging. The interobserver variability was very low for all parameters: pV = 13.5 cm/s edV = 3.4 cm/s
