Thromboembolic complications of angiography for peripheral arterial disease: prospective assessment by Doppler ultrasound. The incidence of thromboembolic arterial complications related to percutaneous angiography done for patients with arterial disease was assessed in 101 cases (105 procedures). There were 2 instances of anterior tibial artery obstruction and 3 of a decline in ankle pressure greater than 20 mmHg in patients with preexisting leg arterial disease. No patient evidenced symptoms of the complications. This incidence of thromboembolic accident, detected by Doppler ultrasound, is significantly less than those incidence rates noted previously, although the reasons for this difference have not yet been established.
