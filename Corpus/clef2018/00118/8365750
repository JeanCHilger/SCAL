Limitations of using arterial conduit for myocardial revascularization in patients with combined coronary and other arterial lesions. To explore the limitations of using arterial conduit for myocardial revascularization in patients with combined coronary and other arterial lesions, we evaluated 195 patients with combined lesions undergoing CABG, either alone or in combination with peripheral vascular reconstruction between October 1987 to October 1990. Doppler flow and spectral analysis revealed that 14 patients (7.1%) had atherosclerotic lesions of the subclavian artery, in whom ipsilateral internal mammary artery pedicle graft was contraindicated for myocardial revascularization. Out of 195 patients, 165 patients were subjected for aortography, 18 of whom (10.9%), revealed atherosclerotic involvement of the celiac trunk, thereby contraindicating the use of gastroepiploic artery for myocardial revascularization. Thus in our experience use of arterial conduit for myocardial revascularization in patients with combined coronary and other arterial lesions is limited.
