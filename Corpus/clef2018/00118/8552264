Anastomotic pseudoaneurysm, true para-anastomotic aneurysm and recurrent aneurysm following surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysm. Is a unifying theory possible?. BACKGROUND. Recurrent aneurysms (RA) and true para-anastomotic aneurysms (TPA) are currently reported as anecdotal findings during occasional follow-up of subjects previously operated for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). In several instances concomitant false anastomotic aneurysms (FAA) are found, not attributable to infection nor to suture or graft degradation. PURPOSE. To discuss the possibility that RA of inborn arteries, TPA, and non infectious FAA, when concomitantly present in the same subject, may reflect a peculiar late presentation of multiarterial aneurysmal disease. MATERIAL. Three cases of occasionally discovered concomitant RA, TPA, and FAA in subjects previously operated for AAA are reported. The finding of new aneurysms and FAA in subjects previously operated for AAA may be theoretically justified by the currently recognized pathogenetic mechanisms, molecular, enzymatic or genetically determined, implicated in the formation of AAA. This points out the need for a correct surgical management of AAAs and for accurate accomplishment of follow-up programmes supported by ultrasound echography of graft-arterial anastomoses and of the arteries at risk of aneurysmal disease.
