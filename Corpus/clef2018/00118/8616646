The aortic polytetrafluoroethylene graft: further experience. We analysed our results with the use of aortic polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE grafts over the last 7.5 years. A historical comparison was also made between the results with non-stretch PTFE (NS-PTFE) (1987-91) and stretch PTFE (S-PTFE) grafts (1991-94).244 infrarenal aortic replacements or bypasses with PTFE grafts were performed at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics from January 1987 to June 1994. Infrarenal aortic replacement was indicated for aortic aneurysmal disease in 192 patients (elective 151, symptomatic 20, ruptured 21) and bypass for aorto-iliac occlusive disease in 52 patients (disabling claudication 28, limb salvage 24). Patients ranged in age from 37 to 93 years (mean 68 years). There were 161 males and 83 females. Medical risk factors included hypertension (55%), coronary artery disease (31%), COPD (23%), diabetes mellitus (12%) chronic renal failure (9%), and smoking (61%). Aortic replacement or bypass was done with a NS-PTFE graft in 108 patients (44%) and a S-PTFE graft in 136 patients (56%). Postoperative ultrasound (US) scans and/or CT-studies were available in 40 patients with NS-PTFE and 26 patients with S-PTFE grafts.The 30 day operative mortality was: elective AAA patients (1.3%), symptomatic AAA patients (10%), ruptured AAA patients (48%), limb salvage patients (4.1%) and disabling claudication patients (0%). Graft related complications included five graft limb thromboses (4 NS-PTFE, 1 S-PTFE). Two thromboses occurred perioperatively and the three others at 24, 28 and 30 months postoperatively. Two other graft related complications included a mixed pseudomonas and streptococcus groin infection with a culture negative perigraft fluid collection occurring 3 weeks following surgery (NS-PTFE), and distal aortic anastomotic suture line bleed on the first postoperative day following replacement of a ruptured AAA with a S-PTFE graft. Based on US and/or CT imaging studies, the mean internal diameters of the bodies of 40 NS-PTFE and 26 S-PTFE grafts were 11% and 10% greater than the manufacturer's specified sizes at a mean follow-up duration of 36 and 10 months respectively.These data reveal that a PTFE graft performs satisfactorily in the aortic position with minimal adverse clinical sequence over a 7.5 year period. Continued long term follow up data will determine the ultimate suitability of aortic PTFE grafts.
