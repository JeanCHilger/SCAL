Interventional radiology: current and future. The current status and the future development of interventional radiology in Japan were reviewed and discussed. The recent development of interventional radiology has been supported by the technological advances in medical imaging modalities, catheters or other devices. Superselective catheterization and embolization of small vessels have been realized by digital subtraction angiography and microcatheters. Intravascular occlusion with detachable coils is an effective treatment for cerebral aneurysms. Results of balloon angioplasty for arterial occlusive disease have been promoted with the use of vascular stents. Stent-grafts for the treatment of aortic aneurysms are under clinical trials in the western countries. New devices such as specially designed balloons for local drug delivery, angioscopic catheters, intravascular ultrasound and atherectomy catheters are now clinically used. Micromachine technologies will also be applied for new therapeutic catheters. In the field of non-vascular interventional radiology, the use of open-magnet MRI and real-time MR fluoroscopy will be useful in lesion localization, needle tracking and monitoring of treatment such as interstitial laser irradiation, radio frequency tumor ablation or ethanol injection. Interventional radiology will be more widely accepted for the treatment of vascular and non-vascular diseases in the future.
