Alloplastic replacement of the urinary bladder. The loss of a functioning bladder is nowadays mostly managed by replacement with gastrointestinal segments. Management of these urinary diversions is difficult and the long-term effects are unknown. We developed a silicone rubber prosthesis for alloplastic replacement of the urinary bladder and tested it in an animal experiment.Two artificial bladders were implanted into subcutaneous pockets on each side of the anterior abdominal wall. Cystectomy was performed and each prosthesis was connected to one kidney. Distally, a Y-shaped tube sutured to the urethral stump joined the two bladder outlets. The whole system was successfully implanted in 5 sheep with a mean follow-up of 11.5 months (5-19 months).Adequate capacity, effective and reliable mechanical function and patent anastomoses to the renal pelvis and the urethra could be achieved. Blood chemistry and renal ultrasound were performed at regular intervals demonstrating neither morphological nor functional deterioration of the renal parenchyma. Histopathological examination in the end of the experiment confirmed the excellent clinical results.The positive outcome of these animal experiments suggests this system would be useful for human bladder substitution. Standardized industrial production of the prostheses will be needed prior to implantation in humans.
