Access to the right renal artery from the left retroperitoneal approach. One of the perceived limitations of the left retroperitoneal approach to the aorta is inadequate access to the right renal artery. Many consider the need for a concomitant right renal artery revascularization a contraindication to performing an aortic reconstruction through the left retroperitoneum. Exposure of the right renal artery can be difficult due to the posterior course of the artery behind the vena cava. However, when the aorta is transected, the right renal artery can be easily approached with anterior and cephalad displacement of the aortic root. Over the past 3 years, 52 patients have had right or bilateral renal artery revascularization via the left retroperitoneal approach of these procedures, 37 were performed with concomitant aortic procedures. In total, 34 patients had bilateral and 18 had unilateral revascularizations. Five patients had a transaortic endarterectomy performed, and 36 were bypassed with 6-mm expanded polytetrafluoroethylene side limbs from the aortic graft. Indications for revascularization were: 39 for suprarenal aortic bypass, seven for renal salvage and six for primary renovascular hypertension. All reconstructions have remained patent and all have been followed by serial duplex and renal flow scans (follow-up for 1-42 months). The operative mortality rate was 5.8% (3/52). There were no major cardiorespiratory complications in this group. Adequate exposure to the proximal right renal artery can be obtained through the left retroperitoneal approach to the aorta, and successful revascularization of one of both renal arteries can be technically performed with acceptable mortality and morbidity.
