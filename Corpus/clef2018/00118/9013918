Magnetic resonance angiography of the aortic arch. Duplex ultrasound and magnetic resonance angiographic (MRA) studies are the principal noninvasive methods for evaluation of extracranial occlusive disease in patients at risk for stroke, but each has limited ability to diagnose aortic arch and arch vessel disease. Recent favorable reports of the nonnephrotoxic contrast agent Gadolinium (Gd) being used to enhance MRA images of the abdominal aorta prompted us to examine its utility for the aortic arch vessels. Prospectively, 28 patients with suspected carotid or arch vessel disease were imaged by contrast arteriographic examination and MRA + Gd of the aortic arch within 30 days of each other. One (for contrast arteriograms) or two (for MRA) blinded readers measured stenoses with the contrast arteriograms as the standard. A total of 196 arch vessels containing 58 stenoses and four occlusions (by arteriogram) were examined with each method. Interobserver agreement for interpretation of MRA studies was substantial (kappa = 0.68). MRA detected all anatomic anomalies (e.g., bovine arch). The correlation of MRA with arteriographic scans for arch vessel stenoses > 50% was sensitivity, 73% (readers 1 and 2) specificity, 98% (reader 1), 89% (reader 2)
