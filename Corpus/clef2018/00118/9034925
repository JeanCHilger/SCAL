Endoluminal graft exclusion of a proximal para-anastomotic pseudoaneurysm following aortobifemoral bypass. To describe a case of endoluminal graft exclusion of a proximal para-anastomotic pseudoaneurysm that occurred 17 years following aortobifemoral bypass for occlusive disease.The lesion was found on abdominal ultrasound examination as part of a work-up for acute abdominal pain and upper gastrointestinal bleeding in a 67-year-old male. A 5-cm saccular pseudoaneurysm was confirmed by preintervention aortography and spiral computed tomography (CT) scanning. Because of the patient's acute symptoms and high-risk medical condition (cardiomyopathy), he was deemed a candidate for endoluminal bypass. At the time of intervention, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) interrogation identified a 3.5-cm-long separation of the existing aortic graft from the proximal aortic stump with a large pseudoaneurysm. The lesion was isolated and repaired by placement of an aortic-to-right iliac endoluminal bypass, ligation of the left limb of the aortofemoral graft, and femorofemoral bypass to restore blood flow to the lower extremities. Spiral CT scans at 48 hours and 3 months following the procedure confirmed complete isolation of the lesion.This case illustrates the feasibility of endografting for repair of aortic para-anastomotic pseudoaneurysms, and it also highlights the potential role of IVUS imaging in endoluminal graft deployment.
