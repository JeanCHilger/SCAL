Blue toes due to floating plaque of the abdominal aorta: endovascular repair with stent. A 60 year old male patient was admitted with so-called blue toes on both sides. Investigation, including real-time ultrasound, revealed a floating plaque on the dorsal side of the abdominal aorta as the most probable cause of the blue toes. By means of simultaneous fluoroscopy and ultrasound guided implantation of a stent it was possible to restore a free lumen of the aorta. The patient had an uncomplicated recovery. Post-operative colour coded Doppler ultrasound showed normal flow in the aorta. Follow-up examination one year after the procedure demonstrated no evidence of further embolic events and a patent aorta.
