Studies on prosthetic valve function--a transesophageal echocardiographic assessment. Haemodynamic assessment was done by colour flow mapping and Doppler interrogation by both Transthoracic (TTE) and Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in 40 consecutive patients (mean age 36.6 +/- 12.35 years) with prosthetic valves. There were 30 cases of mitral (MVR) and 12 aortic (AVR) valve replacement. Major purpose of the study was to detect the sensitivity of TEE in detecting prosthetic valve malfunction particularly in comparison to TTE. Pannus was detected in 3 and 8 cases of MVR (p < 0.01) by TTE and TEE respectively however, TEE was found to be of equal status in detecting pannus over AV (2 cases). Physiological regurgitation in MVR and AVR was detected in 13% and 25% by TTE and 20% and 33% by TEE respectively. Paravalvular leak was detected in 3 cases of MVR by TEE compared to only case by TTE. Though it is difficult to deduce any specific conclusion from this small number of patients, there is definite trend to higher sensitivity in detecting disorders with TEE specially for mitral prostheses.
