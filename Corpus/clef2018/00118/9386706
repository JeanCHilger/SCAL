On-pump, beating-heart coronary artery operations in high-risk patients: an acceptable trade-off? Current cardioplegic techniques do not consistently avoid myocardial ischemic damage in high-risk patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. Alternatively, revascularization without cardiopulmonary bypass is not always technically feasible. We investigated whether an intermediary approach based on maintenance of a beating heart with cardiopulmonary bypass support but without aortic cross-clamping might be an acceptable trade-off.Thirty-seven consecutive patients underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (with an average of two grafts per patient) in a pump-supported, non-cross-clamped beating heart. Inclusion criteria were poor left ventricular function (18 patients mean ejection fraction, 0.25), evolving myocardial ischemia or infarction (11 patients, 5 of whom were in cardiogenic shock), and advanced age (3 patientsThere was one cardiac-related death (2.7%), one Q-wave myocardial infarction, and no strokes. Four other deaths occurred from noncardiac causes, yielding an overall mortality rate of 13.5%. Limitation of myocardial injury was demonstrated by the minimal increase in postoperative troponin Ic levels (3.3 +/- 1.0 micrograms/L versus 6.6 +/- 1.5 micrograms/L in controls p < 0.05) and the finding that heat-shock protein 70 messenger ribonucleic acid levels (expressed as a percentage of an internal standard) were significantly increased after bypass compared with pre-bypass values (279% +/- 80% versus 97% +/- 21%In select high-risk patients, on-pump, beating-heart coronary artery bypass grafting may be an acceptable trade-off between conventional cardioplegia and off-pump operations. It is still associated with the potentially detrimental effects of cardiopulmonary bypass but eliminates intraoperative global myocardial ischemia.
