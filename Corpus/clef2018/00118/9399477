Treatment of chronic iliac artery occlusions with guide wire recanalization and primary stent placement. To evaluate the results of primary stent placement without initial thrombolysis in the treatment of iliac occlusions.During a 3-year period, 61 iliac artery occlusions were treated in 59 patients. The mean length of the occluded segment was 10 cm (range, 4-25 cm). The occluded arteries were treated with primary placement of self-expandable metallic stents.Successful recanalization with primary stent placement was possible in 56 of 61 occlusions (92% technical success rate). Mean Doppler ankle/brachial index increased from 0.51 to 0.90 immediately after treatment and was 0.91 on the last follow-up (P < .05). Primary patency rate at 24 months was 73%, and secondary patency rate was 88%. Procedural complications included distal embolization (n = 4) and an episode of massive intra-abdominal bleeding. Three patients developed a hematoma at the puncture site that did not require additional therapy. Late complications included stent occlusion (n = 9) and significant stenosis related to intimal hyperplasia (n = 1). Mean follow-up period was 29 months (range, 7-55 months).Primary stent placement is an effective therapeutic option for iliac artery occlusions.
