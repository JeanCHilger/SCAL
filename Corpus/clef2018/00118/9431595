Imaging of the vascular system for endovascular grafting and other procedures. Success of endovascular therapy largely depends on accurate imaging before, during, and after the procedure. The vascular system can be evaluated noninvasively with computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and duplex ultrasound (US), or invasively with angiography and intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS). Noninvasive methods are preferred for both preprocedure screening and postprocedure follow-up, whereas invasive imaging modalities constitute an essential part of the endovascular procedure. Invasive techniques are also used in preprocedural or postprocedural evaluation when noninvasive methods are unable to obtain important diagnostic information, or when the confirmation of noninvasive imaging findings is desired. Specific roles of these modalities for endovascular treatment of aortoiliac aneurysms are discussed.
