Evidence based assessment of erectile dysfunction. Do we need impotence testing? Yes, it is the clinician's obligation to establish the etiology of impotence: end organ vascular failure vs neurologic dysfunction vs psychosexual dysfunction, classify the severity of that dysfunction, and select a therapy that is not only acceptable to the patient but also addresses his pathology. The most commonly utilized diagnostic tests for erectile dysfunction are outlined in this monograph. Nocturnal erections are evaluated by tests commonly known as nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT) studies. NPT has been measured by each of the following methods: stamp test, Snap Gauges, strain gauges, NPTR (Rigiscan, Osbon Medical Systems), and sleep lab NPTR. Normal Nocturnal Penile Tumescence and Rigidity (NPTR) depends on both the integrity of the corticospinal efferents to the penis and vascular responsiveness of the penile tissues to those nerve signals. When nocturnal erections are of appropriate duration and strength the central and peripheral neuroeffectors and intra-corporal regulators of penile hemodynamics are intact. Unfortunately, abnormal NPTR is of little value in determining the etiology or classifying the severity of vascular impotence the most prevalent kind of end organ failure. The sacral reflex arc of erection consists of somatosensory afferents via the dorsal and pudendal nerves and autonomic efferents via the pelvic and cavernous nerves. These afferents have been measured indirectly by somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) and bulbocavernosus reflex latency (BCR). Penile EMG's have recently been recorded, corporal cavernosal smooth muscle electrical activity: CC-EMG. This technology is far from standardized
