Poor reproducibility of exercise test in assessment of claudication. To assess reproducibility of the exercise test in intermittent claudication, a prospective, comparative, randomized study was undertaken. Ten patients with stable intermittent claudication of ischaemic origin were exercised on a flat surface (0-Ex), with 12% steady inclination (12-Ex) and with progressively increasing inclination (p-Ex) in a random order during three different sessions. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) at rest and after exercise (rABI, exABI), initial and maximum walking distance (IWD, MWD) and metabolic equivalent (MET) were obtained as the main outcome measures. The results were analysed using intraindividual coefficients of variation (CVs) and standard deviations (SDs). The ABI values of the worst extremity were used in evaluation of results. Reproducibility of the exercise ABI appeared to be good, especially during progressively increasing exercise, the mean CV being 9 +/- 5%. The best mean CV was observed during p-Ex (16% +/- 14%) for maximum walking distance. The mean CV for initial walking distances ranged from 30% to 54%. Treadmill exercise testing to measure walking distances is highly inaccurate and the value of exercise on the flat treadmill should be questioned. Graded exercise appeared to be the most reproducible in this respect. The ABI after exercise, however, was a reliable single parameter when assessing arterial insufficiency causing decreased walking capacity.
