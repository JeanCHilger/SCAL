Review of respiratory mechanics in animals. 4. The diagnostic affirmation ability of research using the impulse oscilloresistometry system (IOS) in calves. Taking methodological and physiological aspects into account (see Part 3), the impulse oscillometry system (IOS) was found to be sensitive to detecting and to quantifying clinically relevant changes in respiratory mechanics in calves. Therefore, the complex respiratory impedance needs to be measured in terms of resistance and reactance within the frequency range between 5 Hz and 20 Hz. The behaviour of resistance and reactance in dependence of frequency allows to differentiate and to localise airway obstructions. Obstructions of upper (extrathoracic) airways were mainly characterised by a frequency independent increase in the resistance. Within the reactance curve, no change in the resonant frequency could be observed. In a peripheral airway obstruction both resistance and reactance changed. The most typical finding concerning resistance was that a negative frequency dependence occurred. The reactance became more negative. Following this, the resonant frequency increased. With progressive obstruction of the peripheral airways, the reactance became more informative than resistance.
