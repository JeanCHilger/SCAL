Phantom for calibration of preoperative imaging modalities in endoluminal stent-graft repair of aortic aneurysms. Successful deployment of an endoluminal prosthesis for repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is critically dependent on accurate preoperative assessment of aneurysm morphology with use of such modalities as contrast aortography (CA), spiral computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and intravascular ultrasonography (IVUWS). The authors describe a new phantom that could be used both to calibrate these four imaging modalities and to determine which imaging technique(s) is (are) best for preoperative AAA sizing.A life-sized AAA model was constructed of silicone elastomers with luminal access ports for introduction of contrast media and catheters. Contrast material-filled rings were positioned circumferentially along the length of the model as reference points for dimension measurements. The modalities were compared to each other relative to the actual dimensions of the model, as determined at its construction.In this pilot study, all modalities were relatively similar in their ability to measure the dimensions of the AAA model. Length measurements accounted for most of the interinstitutional and interobserver variability. MR imaging had the least variability.The authors developed a new phantom that can be imaged successfully with CA, CT, MR imaging, and IVUS in repetitive, reproducible fashion. Structural refinements and future larger scale, statistically significant evaluations of such models should establish this as a useful adjunct in multicenter endoluminal stent-graft trials to allow calibration of imaging modalities and to determine which modality or modalities is (are) best for preoperative AAA sizing.
