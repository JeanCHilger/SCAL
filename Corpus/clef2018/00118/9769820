Aortoiliac aneurysms: endoluminal repair--clinical evidence for a fully supported stent-graft. To evaluate aortoiliac aneurysms repaired with endovascular stent-grafts complicated by hemodynamically significant graft stenosis.Fifty-four patients (52 men, two women age range, 41-90 yearsStent-grafts were placed successfully in all cases. Stenosis at the internal iliac arterial origin was identified at angiography in 17 patients (31%). Supplemental intragraft stents were placed in 11 patients, and stent-graft angioplasty alone was performed in one patient. Intragraft stents were placed percutaneously in five patients when stenosis was discovered during follow-up.Supplemental intragraft stents were required in 31% of aortoiliac endovascular stent-grafts to correct stent-graft stenosis and preserve long-term function. Placement of a fully supported stent-graft is necessary to repair an aortoiliac aneurysm.
