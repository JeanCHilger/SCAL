Aortoiliac reconstructive surgery based upon the results of duplex scanning. To evaluate whether duplex scanning can replace angiography in patients operated for aortoiliac obstructive disease.Retrospective.Between January 1995 and October 1996, 44 patients underwent vascular surgery of the aortoiliac tract. The study population was divided into two groups patients operated upon the results of duplex scanning only and patients who also underwent angiography prior to surgery. The additional value of angiography and the differences between both groups concerning unexpected peroperative findings, early postoperative failures and the need for additional radiological or surgical interventions in the first three postoperative months were studied.Duplex scan group: 22 patients were operated upon the results of duplex scanning only. In two patients surgical strategy had to be changed. Early postoperative graft occlusion occurred in one case. A haemodynamically significant graft stenosis within 3 months of surgery occurred in one patient. Duplex/angiography group: 22 patients underwent both duplex scanning and angiography. Six patients underwent diagnostic angiography after failed duplex scanning. In 10 patients angiography was part of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty prior to surgery. In six patients angiograms were performed after successful duplex scanning. Angiography failed in two patients and added information in four of 16 patients. Unexpected findings at operation occurred in four patients. Graft stenosis within 3 months was detected in three patients.After successful duplex scanning information obtained by angiography has only a limited impact on therapeutic decision-making. In the majority of patients vascular reconstructive surgery of aortoiliac arteries can be planned based on duplex scanning only.
