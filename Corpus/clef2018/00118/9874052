Effects of pravastatin on thoracic aortic atherosclerosis in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Data regarding the effects of plasma lipid lowering on the evolution of thoracic aortic atherosclerosis (TAA) are scarce. In this study, we performed transesophageal echocardiography to characterize TAA in 16 newly diagnosed patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and to follow its evolution after 2 years of statin treatment. TAA was graded as follows: grade I = normal intima grade II = increased intimal echo density without thickening
