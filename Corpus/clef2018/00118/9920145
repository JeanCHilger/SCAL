Stiffness of the aortic wall in hypercholesterolemic children. Arterial stiffness may be an indicator of early vascular changes signaling the development of vascular disease, while hypercholesterolemia is a well-recognized promoter of atherogenesis. It has been shown that hypercholesterolemic children have a thicker intima-media in the carotid artery than children with normal cholesterol. The aim of this study was to assess the stiffness of the abdominal aorta in children with hypercholesterolemia. Noninvasive imaging evaluation of the aorta was performed in 85 outpatient children (age, 3 to 14 years) with and without high cholesterol levels ((and) 247 mg/dL [6.4 mmol/L], respectively). Ultrasound imaging of the abdominal aorta that allowed diameter measurements was available in 67 children. Using an image-processing workstation, the maximum and minimum internal diameter of the aorta was measured, and the following indices of elastic properties of the abdominal aorta were derived: arterial strain, pressure-strain elastic modulus, and stiffness. No statistical difference for aortic strain, stiffness, and elastic modulus was found in normocholesterolemic compared with hypercholesterolemic children. The effect of age on the elastic modulus was different in the two groups: in normal children, the elastic modulus increased linearly with age (y = -0.020+0.003 x age [months], P<.001), while the high-cholesterol group had a weak increase in this parameter with age (y = 0.118+0.0009 x age, P = .051). The slope of the regression equations (elastic modulus vage) was significantly different in the two groups (t = 2.45, P = .017). The behavior of arterial stiffness with respect to age was similar, y = 0.677+0.018 x age (P = .002) in normocholesterolemic children and y = 2.06+0.00198 x age (P = .66) in hypercholesterolemic children. The slope of the regression equations (stiffness v. age) was significantly different in the two groups (t = 2.37, P = .021). The present study demonstrates an influence of hypercholesterolemia on age-related modification in the elastic properties of the aorta. A remodeling of the aortic wall in hypercholesterolemic children (cholesterolemia >247 mg/dL) could explain the different age-dependent increase in aortic elastic modulus and stiffness.
