The early angiographic follow-up of myocardial revascularization in a minithoracotomy: the results of the first 100 consecutive cases. The use of the left internal thoracic artery anastomized to the left anterior descending coronary artery via a small left thoracotomy to revascularize the anterior wall of the left ventricle has gained wide acceptance since its introduction into clinical practice a few years ago. A mandatory, postoperative angiographic control was suggested in order to check the surgical results of this new method of revascularization. We herein analyze the results of the in-hospital angiographic control of a series of 100 consecutive patients who underwent minimally invasive coronary artery bypass. In all 100 patients the thoracic graft, the anastomosis and the target vessel were patent, with no anomalies in 90 subjects. In 4 patients, a sharp angulation of the thoracic artery in the last third before the anastomosis to the native vessel was observed in 3 subjects, the arterial graft had been anastomized to a diseased tract of the target vessel and in 3 cases a significant stenosis of the target vessel beyond the anastomosis was documented
