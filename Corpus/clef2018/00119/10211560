A double bifurcated graft for abdominal aorta and bilateral iliac artery reconstruction. Revascularization of the hypogastric artery often tends to be neglected in aortoiliac reconstructive surgery however, its incomplete revascularization can result in unfavorable complications such as buttock claudication or necrosis, vascular impotence, and colonic ischemia. Multiple vascular lesions in the abdominal aorta and bilateral iliac arteries were reconstructed using a newly designed double bifurcated graft in five male patients. All five patients demonstrated excellent graft limb patency and postoperative improvement of the ankle-brachial pressure index without any clinical signs of ischemia in regions of the hypogastric artery. Thus, we conclude that an aggressive approach toward hypogastric circulation maintenance is essential in aortoiliac reconstructive surgery. By using this double bifurcated graft, rapid and safe revascularization of the bilateral hypogastric arteries concomitant with the external iliac or femoral arteries can be performed.
