Possibilities of early functional diagnosis of arteriosclerosis obliterans of the main arteries of the leg. The dynamics of blood flow volume was studied in the leg (by way of venous occlusive pletysmography), as well as the systolic pressure in the leg (by way of Winsor's volumetric determination), and the oscillometric index in the leg (by way of arterial oscillography with a sensitive optic recording system), these studies being conducted in 103 patients during reactive and work hyperenia corresponding in terms of the severity of the involvement of the major arteries to the initial, clinincally latent, stage of obliterative atherosclerosis. At the beginning of hyperemia diagnostically valuable and statistically significant shifts of the above parameters of blood supply to the leg were revealed in the patients, as compared to the normal individuals. Of diagnostic importance was not only the absolute degree of the changes in the beginning of hyperemia, but also the period of restoration of tthe initial level of the parameter in question. Some of the obtained quantitative criteria demonstrating the patency disorders in the major arteries of the extremities are recommended for early detection of persons with clinically latent obliterative atherosclerosis.
