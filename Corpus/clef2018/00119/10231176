Mapping of cerebrovascular reactivity using BOLD magnetic resonance imaging. Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) contrast MRI is a simple non-invasive method of estimating "perfusion," and combined with a vasodilatory stimulus, may allow estimation of cerebral vascular reserve. We compared BOLD carbon dioxide (CO2) reactivity in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) perfusion territory to MCA flow velocity reactivity determined using transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) in 16 patients with unilateral carotid artery stenosis or occlusion. Both BOLD and TCD reactivities were calculated from measurements acquired when the subjects were breathing air, and again when breathing a 6% CO2/air mixture, and were normalized by dividing by the difference in end tidal (ET) CO2. There was a significant correlation between interhemispheric MCA reactivity difference (contralateral-ipsilateral to the stenosis or occlusion) determined by BOLD MRI and TCD (r = 0.75, p < 0.001). In contrast, treating each hemisphere individually, there was no correlation between the absolute BOLD and TCD MCA CO2 reactivities (r = 0.08, p = 0.670). This appeared to be due to a variable BOLD signal change in the non-stenosed hemisphere between subjects, with little change in the normal hemisphere of a few subjects. In one patient, focal regions of reduced reactivity were seen in non-infarcted regions of the stenosed hemisphere, in the borderzones between arterial territories. BOLD reactivity maps provide information on the whole MCA territory reactivity, and may identify small regions of impaired reactivity which are not detected using TCD. However, BOLD reactivity maps only appear to provide semi-quantitative rather than quantitative data.
