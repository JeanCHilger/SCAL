Carotid intima-media thickness and coronary heart disease risk factors in a low-risk population. Coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors have been consistently related to an increase in carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) in selected populations. However, few studies were population-based and furthermore little attention has been given to the influence of CHD risk factors on IMT in low-risk populations for CHD.We examined the association between carotid IMT and CHD risk factors in a large (n = 1013) and representative sample of middle-aged men and women in one of the European populations with the lowest CHD risk.High-resolution B-mode ultrasonography of the common carotid arteries was performed.Age, smoking (not significant in women), body mass index, waist to hip ratio, systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure, alcohol consumption, total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, glycaemia, fibrinogen (not significant in women), haematocrit (not significant in men) and insulin (not significant in women) were positively and significantly associated with mean IMT. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (not significant in women) was negatively and significantly associated with mean IMT. In a subsample of 355 men, IMT was not associated with angiotensin I-converting enzyme gene polymorphism. Multivariate analyses showed, in men, independent associations between mean IMT (0.61+/-0.11 mm) and age, pack-years, SBP, HDL cholesterol, alcohol and the interaction between age and alcohol. In women, only age and SBP were independently associated with mean IMT (0.58+/-0.09 mm).We found thinner IMT than those found in high-risk populations, suggesting that an increased IMT might reflect local atherosclerosis. Protective factors such as HDL cholesterol or regular and moderate alcohol consumption are probably important determinants of the early stages of atherosclerosis in these low-risk populations.
