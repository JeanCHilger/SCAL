Coronary artery vasomotion and post-stenotic coronary artery blood flow after intracoronary lacidipine in patients with ischaemic heart disease: a pilot study. The calcium antagonist lacidipine has been shown to be highly vasoselective and to improve myocardial perfusion in hypertensive patients. However, its effects on coronary artery vasomotility and on post-stenotic coronary flow reserve in patients with atherosclerotic heart disease are unknown.This study was designed to investigate the acute direct effects of repeated infusions of lacidipine on epicardial coronary artery vasomotion and on post-stenotic coronary artery blood flow in patients with stable angina pectoris and angiographic evidence of coronary heart disease.In 8 patients with stable angina and moderate to severe stenosis of the left coronary artery, measurements of epicardial dimensions (quantitative angiography) and of coronary blood flow (Doppler guidewire) distal to a stenosis were performed at baseline and after 3 repeated intracoronary boluses of 12 microg of lacidipine. Results were compared with those obtained after 10 mg of intracoronary papaverine.The intracoronary administration of lacidipine was well tolerated, without any adverse effects. Lacidipine significantly increased the minimal luminal diameter of the lesion (peak relative increase of 43.7%), without significant changes in heart rate and systolic aortic pressure. Intracoronary lacidipine caused a dose-dependent increase in coronary flow reserve. Maximal vasodilatory effects were equivalent to those obtained with intracoronary papaverine.These results suggest that lacidipine acts directly as a potent vasodilator in stenotic epicardial vessels and improves myocardial perfusion distal to a moderately severe stenosis in patients with stable angina.
