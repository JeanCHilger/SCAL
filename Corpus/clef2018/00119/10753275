Intraoperative duplex monitoring of infrainguinal vein bypass procedures. The purpose of this study was to evaluate intraoperative duplex scanning of infrainguinal vein bypass grafts to detect technical and hemodynamic problems, monitor their repair, and correlate findings with the incidence of thrombosis and stenosis repair rates within 90 days of operation.Color duplex scanning was used at operation to assess vein/anastomotic patency and velocity spectra waveforms of 626 infrainguinal vein bypass grafts (in situ saphenous, 228 grafts nonreversed translocated saphenous, 170 graftsDuplex scanning prompted revision of 104 lesions in 96 (15%) bypass grafts, including 82 vein/anastomotic stenoses, 17 vein segments with platelet thrombus, and 5 low-flow grafts. Revision rate was highest (P <.01) for alternative vein bypass grafts (27%) compared with the other grafting methods (reversed vein bypass grafts, 10% nonreversed translocated, 13%The observed 15% intraoperative revision rate coupled with a low 90-day failure/revision rate (2.5%) for bypasses with normal papaverine-augmented duplex scans supports the routine use of this diagnostic modality to enhance the precision and early results of infrainguinal vein bypass procedures.
