Ulnar artery graft for myocardial revascularization. We present a 60-year-old man who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting using an ulnar artery as one of the grafts intended to release angina pectoris. Previously, his right leg had been amputated following a traffic accident. The blood supply of his left leg was reduced due to atherosclerotic stenotic change (left ankle pressure index 0.6). He had been under treatment for severe diabetes mellitus for 4 years. Coronary angiography revealed severe stenosis in the triple coronary artery system. Immediate myocardial revascularization was considered necessary. We considered that saphenous vein grafts and bilateral internal thoracic artery grafts were unsuitable for this patient. Moreover, Allen's test was positive in the bilateral forearms. Coronary artery bypass surgery consisted of left internal thoracic artery grafting to the left anterior descending artery, right gastroepiploic artery grafting to the right coronary artery, and left ulnar artery grafting to the diagonal branch. No myocardial or hand complications were observed after surgery. Following a review of the Japanese literature, we conclude that our case is the first report of an ulnar artery graft for coronary artery bypass grafting in Japan.
