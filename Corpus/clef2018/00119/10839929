Single-beat estimation of ventricular end-systolic elastance-effective arterial elastance as an index of ventricular mechanoenergetic performance. The ratio of ventricular end-systolic elastance (Ees) to effective arterial elastance (Ea) is known to reflect not only ventricular mechanical performance but also energetic performance. Despite these useful features, technical difficulties associated with estimating Ees make the clinical application of Ees/Ea impractical. We developed a framework to estimate Ees/Ea without measuring ventricular volume or altering the loading condition.To achieve this goal, we approximated the ventricular time-varying elastance curve with two straight lines, one for the isovolumic phase and the other for the ejection phase, and characterized the curve with the slope ratio, k, of these two straight lines. Using the concept of the pressure-volume relationship, Ees/Ea is algebraically expressed as Ees/Ea = Pad/Pes (1 + k. ET/PEP) - 1, where Pes is end-systolic pressure, Pad is aortic diastolic pressure, ET is ejection time, and PEP is pre-ejection period. In 11 anesthetized dogs, we recorded arterial and ventricular pressures and ventricular volume and estimated Ees and Ea under various contractile states and loading conditions.An empirical relation between k and Ees/Ea was found as k = 0.53 (Ees/Ea)0.51. Simultaneous solution of these two equations yielded Ees/Ea as a function of Pad/Pes and ET/PEP. The estimated Ees/Ea values correlated well with the measured Ees/Ea values ([Measured Ees/Ea] = 0.96 [Estimated Ees/Ea] + 0.098, r = 0.925, SEE = 0.051).The proposed framework is capable of estimating Ees/Ea from ventricular and aortic pressure.
