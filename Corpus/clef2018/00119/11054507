Impact of estradiol blood concentrations on skin capillary Laser Doppler flow in premenopausal women. Estradiols are known to prevent cardiovascular diseases, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We assessed the finger skin capillary blood flow in 20 premenopausal women with oral contraception noninvasively by Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF). Blood flow was registered both under basal conditions and after 2 min of arterial occlusion. Furthermore, the combination with a beat-to-beat online finger blood pressure monitor allowed the calculation of the regional peripheral resistance (RPR). All measurements were performed in the menstrual phase. LDF and RPR were correlated to the estradiol whole blood levels.Both baseline (r(2)=0.826 P<0.01) and vasodilation (r(2)=0.747The study provides evidence that both the baseline and the vasodilation capillary blood flux in women in the menstrual phase depend on the estradiol whole blood levels. Furthermore, the local vascular resistance shows a negative correlation to the hormonal state. Functional or structural alterations of the microvasculature may therefore contribute to the estradiol-associated cardiovascular protection.
