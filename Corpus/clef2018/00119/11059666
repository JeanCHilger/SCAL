No additional neuroprotection provided by barbiturate-induced burst suppression under mild hypothermic conditions in rats subjected to reversible focal ischemia. Mild-to-moderate hypothermia is increasingly used for neuroprotection in humans. However, it is unknown whether administration of barbiturate medications in burst-suppressive doses-the gold standard of neuroprotection during neurovascular procedures-provides an additional protective effect under hypothermic conditions. The authors conducted the present study to answer this question.Thirty-two Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 90 minutes of middle cerebral artery occlusion and randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: 1) normothermic controls 2) methohexital treatment (burst suppression)The results of this study indicate that barbiturate-induced burst suppression is not required to achieve maximum neuroprotection under mild hypothermic conditions. The magnitude of protection afforded by barbiturates alone appears to be modest compared with that provided by mild hypothermia.
