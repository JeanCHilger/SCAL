Effects of exercise rehabilitation on endothelial reactivity in older patients with peripheral arterial disease. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Endothelial function, which is a measure of vascular health, is impaired in patients with PAD. We examined the effects of 6 months of aerobic exercise rehabilitation on brachial artery endothelial function, assessed using high-frequency ultrasonography, and calf blood flow in 19 older PAD patients (age 69 +/- 1 years, mean +/- SEM) with intermittent claudication (ankle to brachial artery index of 0.73 +/- 0.04). After exercise, the time to onset of claudication pain increased by 94%, from 271 +/- 49 to 525 +/- 80 seconds (p <0.01), and the time to maximal claudication pain increased by 43%, from 623 +/- 77 to 889 +/- 75 seconds (p <0.05). Exercise rehabilitation increased the flow-mediated brachial arterial diameter by 61%, from 0.18 +/- 0.03 to 0.29 +/- 0.04 mm (p <0.005), as well as the relative change in brachial arterial diameter from the resting state by 60%, from 4.81 +/- 0.82% to 7.97 +/- 1.03% (p <0.005). Maximal calf blood flow (14.2 +/- 1.0 vs 19.2 +/- 2.0 ml/100 ml/min p = 0.04), and postocclusive reactive hyperemic blood flow (9.8 +/- 0.8 vs 11.3 +/- 0.7 ml/100 ml/min
