PTA versus Palmaz stent placement in femoropopliteal artery obstructions: a multicenter prospective randomized study. To evaluate if stent placement is superior to percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in the treatment of chronic symptoms in short femoropopliteal arterial lesions.One hundred fifty-four limbs in 141 patients who ranged in age from 39 to 87 years (mean age, 67 years) were randomized to PTA (n = 77) versus PTA followed by implantation of Palmaz stents (n = 77). Inclusion criteria were patients with intermittent claudication (n = 108, Society of Vascular Surgery/International Society of Cardiovascular Surgery [SVS-ISCVS] categories 1-3) or chronic critical limb ischemia (n = 46 with either ischemic rest pain [category 4] or minor tissue loss [category 5]), short stenosis or occlusion (lesion length < or = 5 cm), and at least one patent run-off vessel at angiography. Follow-up included clinical assessment, measurement of ankle/ brachial index (ABI), color duplex ultrasound, and/or angiography at 6 or 12 months. Angiographic follow-up between 12 and 36 months was available in 46 limbs (29.9%).In the PTA group, initial technical success was achieved in 65 of 77 limbs (84%) versus 76 of 77 (99%) limbs in the stent group (chi2 value = 0.009). Overall, major complications occurred in 3.9% (n = 6) n = 4 in the PTA group compared to n = 2 in the stent group. There was no difference between groups of treatment: hemodynamic/clinical success at 1 and 2 years in the PTA group was 72% and 65% versus 77% and 65% in the stent group (Gehan P value = .26). The cumulative 1- and 2-year angiographic primary patency rates were 63% and 53%, respectively, for both groups. The secondary 1- and 2-year angiographic patency rates were 86% and 74% in the PTA group versus 79% and 73% in the stent group (P = .5).After stent placement, the primary success rate was significantly higher than after PTA. However, 1-year angiographic and clinical/hemodynamic success was not improved.
