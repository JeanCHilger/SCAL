Lower extremity strength deficits in peripheral arterial occlusive disease patients with intermittent claudication. The purposes of this study were to quantify the degree and distribution of lower extremity weakness in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) compared to apparently healthy older patients and to determine if performance of a simple functional measure correlates with lower extremity strength. Older patients (n = 46), 31 with PAOD (mean age = 69.9 years mean ankle-brachial index = 0.67) and 15 without PAOD (mean age = 62.6 years
