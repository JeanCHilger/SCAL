Salvage of ischemic digits using a lateral arm fascial flap. Four patients underwent microvascular transfer of a lateral arm fascial flap to salvage severely ischemic digits by means of induction of neovascularization. The cause of the digital ischemia was direct trauma (crush injury) in one patient and chronic embolic phenomena (proximal arterial occlusion) in three patients. None of the patients had responded to traditional therapy, including treatment with one or more of the following: anticoagulation, lytic therapy, oral vasodilators, digital sympathectomy, and vein bypass grafting. Each patient underwent noninvasive (Doppler ultrasound, digital pressures, digital temperatures, vascular refill) and invasive (angiogram) vascular assessment preoperatively. After microvascular transfer of the lateral arm fascial flap, all patients reported symptomatic relief, and objective improvements were documented by both noninvasive and invasive assessment criteria. One patient developed a seroma at the donor site another experienced a late complication of thrombosis of the flap after his wound dehisced. A 6-month follow-up evaluation demonstrated neovascular collateralization and stable improvement without regression in the remaining patients. The authors present their clinical experience and propose a treatment algorithm for patients with chronic digital ischemia.
