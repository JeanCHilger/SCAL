Noninvasive localization of infrainguinal arterial occlusive disease in diabetics. A retrospective review of 101 diabetics without aortoiliac disease was carried out to analyze the ability of various noninvasive tests to predict the level of significant (>50% stenosis) infrainguinal arterial disease. Patients were studied with anklebrachial indices (ABI), toebrachial indices (TBI), segmental pulse volume recordings (PVR), segmental pressures (SEGP), segmental Doppler waveforms (DWF), and arteriography. Results were classified as normal, disease at the femoropopliteal level, infrapopliteal level, or both levels (multilevel), or noninterpretable. Our findings for the entire study showed that, as a single test, DWF appears to have the best angiographic correlation, although the summed diagnosis of combined DWF and PVR data is superior in distinguishing multilevel disease from isolated tibial disease. SEGP are of very limited use in diabetics, even in multimodality testing, and we no longer include that test in our routine evaluation of diabetics.
