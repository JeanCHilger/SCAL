Percutaneous hydromechanical thrombectomy in acute and subacute lower limb ischemia. A prospective study should evaluate the primary and 2-year results of treating acute and subacute lower-limb ischemia with hydromechanical thrombectomy (HTE).Consecutively 64 patients, 12 with viable and 52 with threatening limb ischemia and onset of symptoms within 8 +/- 9 days, were treated and controlled for 24 months. An 8 F hydromechanical thrombectomy device (HTK), was used. It sucks and shreds the thrombi. The shredded particles are transported to the outside.In 8 patients a total, in the others a partial restoration of the vessel lumen up to 70-50% was achieved in a mean time of 34 minutes. Residual thrombi, underlying atherosclerotic vessel disease and occluded arteries with a small diameter made adjunctive interventions (balloon angioplasty, percutaneous aspiration thrombectomy, lysis) necessary. Clinical symptoms and the ankle-brachial index improved significantly (p < 0.01). Primary patency was 72%, 70%, 67%, and 65% the limb salvage rates were 81%, 78%, 75%, and 73% for one, 3, 12, and 24 months respectively. Device-induced complications did not occur.The HTK allowed a rapid reduction of fresh thrombotic material without complications. In 78% of the cases adjunctive therapies are required for wall-adherent thrombi and when tibial vessels with smaller lumina are included. Long-term results are comparable to literature data for fibrinolytic or operative regimens. The advantage, however of the HTK seems to be the reduction of intervention time and intra-arterial dosage of fibrinolytic drugs.
