Parameters of postocclusive reactive hyperemia measured by near infrared spectroscopy in patients with peripheral vascular disease and in healthy volunteers. The main purpose of our study was to determine the parameters of the postocclusive reactive hyperemia test that could help and provide the clinician with information about the tissue oxygenation, the severity of the disease, and the results of the applied therapies. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) proved to be a valid noninvasive trend monitor useful for investigating the physiology of oxygen transport to tissue. Important advantages of NIRS over transcutaneous oximetry (TcpO2) are: (a) a more dynamic nature of the NIRS signals which reflects more closely the actual response of the peripheral vasculature to the occlusive provocation (b) larger sampling volume
