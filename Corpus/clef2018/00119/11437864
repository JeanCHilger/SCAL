Sodium carboxyl-methyl-cellulose dressings in the management of deep ulcerations of diabetic foot. To test the safety and effectiveness of carboxyl-methyl-cellulose dressing (Aquacel ConvaTec, UK) in the management of deep diabetic foot ulcers, a group of consecutive out-patients attending the foot clinic of the Department of Metabolic Diseases was studied.Patients were selected according to the following inclusion criteria: a foot ulcer deeper than 1 cm for > 3 weeks, good peripheral blood supply (palpable peripheral pulses or ABPI > 0.9). Exclusion criteria were as follows: active infection, as evident from clinical signs (purulent discharge, redness, swelling, tenderness) and confirmed by culture exams, plasma creatinine > 2 mg/dl, recent episodes of ketoacidosis, malignancies, and any therapy or pathology which might interfere with the healing process. Twenty patients were enrolled in the study and having obtained their informed consent, their lesions were surgically debrided with the complete elimination of all necrotic tissue and debris up to the bleeding healthy tissue then ulcers were staged and measured, and patients were randomly assigned to two different treatment groups. Patients in group A were dressed with saline-moistened gauze, while patients in group B were dressed with Aquacel according to the manufacturer's instructions. All patients in both groups received special post-operative shoes (PodiabetesHT was significantly shorter in Group B than in Group A (P < 0.001). RLV was significantly (P < 0.01) higher in Group B patients compared with Group A, as well as GT (P < 0.05). IC were in 1/10 Group B and in 3/10 Group A (P = 0.582). In addition, both ILTC and Delta TC were higher in Group B compared with Group A ones (P < 0.01).Carboxyl-methyl-cellulose dressings were shown to be safe, effective and well tolerated in the management of non-ischaemic, non-infected deep diabetic foot ulcers.
