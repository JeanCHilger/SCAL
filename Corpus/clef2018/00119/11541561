Cardiovascular effects of simulated zero-gravity in humans. Head-down and head-up [correction of heat-up] tilted bedrest (5 degrees) and head out water immersion (HOWI) for 6 hr were compared.Cardiac output (rebreathing method), blood pressure (arm cuff), forearm blood flow (venous occlusion plethysmography), total peripheral (TPR), and forearm vascular (FVR) resistances, Hct, Hb, relative plasma volume (PV) changes, and plasma catecholamines (single-isotope assay). During HOWI there was as expected a decrement in TPR, FVR, Mean arterial pressure (MAP, from 100 to 80 mmHg), Hct, and PV, and--as a new finding--catecholamines, which were 30-50% lower compared with both +5 and -5 degrees bedrest. During head down tilt, MAP was elevated (to 100-110 mmHg) and catecholamines did not fall, while TPR and EVR slowly decreased over 6 hr. HOWI is a stronger stimulus than -5 degrees bedrest, probably because HOWI elevates central venous pressure more markedly emptying the peripheral veins, while bedrest permits a distension of veins, which induces an increase in sympathetic nervous activity.
