MR flow mapping in coronary artery bypass grafts: a validation study with Doppler flow measurements. To validate fast magnetic resonance (MR) flow mapping with intravascular Doppler flow measurements in vitro and in patients with nonstenotic and stenotic coronary artery bypass grafts.MR and Doppler flow measurements were performed in a small-diameter flow phantom with physiologic flow conditions and at baseline and during adenosine stress in 27 grafts in 23 patients, who were scheduled for cardiac catheterization. At invasive analysis, the grafts were divided into those with stenosis of less than 50% (nonstenotic) and those with stenosis greater than or equal to 50% (stenotic). In vitro velocity values and velocity values in nonstenotic and stenotic grafts were compared with linear regression analysis, and the in vitro interstudy variability was determined.Excellent correlations in average peak velocity (r = 0.99, P <.001) and diastolic peak velocity (r = 0.99, P <.001) were demonstrated in vitro between MR and Doppler flow measurements, with less than 5% interstudy variability. MR and Doppler flow measurements revealed good correlations in peak velocity and velocity reserve both in nonstenotic (n = 20) (average peak velocity: r = 0.81, P <.001 diastolic peak velocity: r = 0.83, P <.001Fast MR flow mapping provides noninvasive measures of peak velocity and velocity reserve, which closely correlate with Doppler values both in vitro and in nonstenotic and stenotic grafts.
