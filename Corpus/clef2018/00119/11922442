Coil occlusion of the small patent arterial duct without arterial access. Arterial access is traditionally considered mandatory during coil occlusion of the patent arterial duct. Arterial access necessitates heparinization and carries the risk of femoral artery occlusion in small children.Between July 1999 and May 2001, we attempted coil occlusion of patent arterial ducts in 104 patients without arterial access. The patients were aged from 3 months to 14 years. The median age was 2 years. They weighed 3-35 kg. The median weight was 9.8 kg. The duct diameter at pulmonary artery insertion was 1.8-3.5 mm. The patients were selected on basis of echocardiographic evaluation of duct diameter at pulmonary artery insertion and morphology of the ampulla. Doppler color flow imaging was used in the catheterization laboratory to confirm duct closure. Arterial access was required in 21 patients. The reasons included accidental puncture in 5 patients, failure to obtain venous access in 1 patient, aortic embolization in 3 patients, poor echo images in 2 patients, requirement for additional coils in 8 patients and, failure to cross the duct from pulmonary artery in 2 patients. The fluoroscopic time ranged from 2.2 to 20 min with a mean of 5.3+/-3.8 min. Immediate closure was achieved in 98 patients and this included 79 of the 83 patients in whom arterial access was avoided. Color Doppler 3-24 h later showed residual flow in 2 patients. Four patients had new-onset left pulmonary artery turbulence with peak gradients below 5 mm of mercury. Coil embolization occurred in 6 patients and all coils were retrieved. Three-month follow up information was available for 78 patients. Small residual ductal leaks were seen in 4 patients, 2 of whom had leaks at 24 h. Two patients had recanalized their ducts.It is feasible to occlude small patent arterial ducts with coils using venous access alone in carefully selected patients with excellent immediate and short-term results.
