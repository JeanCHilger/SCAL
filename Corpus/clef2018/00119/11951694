Indications for and limitations of exercise training in patients with intermittent claudication. The selection of candidates for exercise training among patients with intermittent claudication is still a matter of debate.Forty-nine patients with intermittent claudication due to arteriosclerosis obliterans were tested. Forty-six patients were men and 3 were women, with an average age of 65 years (range, 46 to 76 years). The patients walked on a treadmill at 2.4 km/h on a 12% upgrade followed by an appropriate period of rest for 30 minutes twice a day during a 3-week hospitalization. Programs were individualized for each patient. Four parameters were assessed after exercise training: (1) Ankle-brachial index (ABI) at rest, (2) Fall in ABI after 40 m of treadmill walking (ABI Fall 40), (3) the recovery time (RT 40) required for the ABI to return to resting levels after 40 m of walking, and (4) the maximal walking distance (MWD) on the treadmill.The average ABI at rest before the 3-week training period was 0.60 +/- 0.02 (mean +/- SE), and after training it was 0.62 +/- 0.02. There was a small although not statistically significant increase in the ABI after training. This increase in the ABI did not exceed 0.21. The average ABI Fall 40 before training was 0.36 +/- 0.01, and after training it was 0.30 +/- 0.02. The average RT 40 before training was 9.9 +/- 0.8 min, and after training it was 6.2 +/- 0.6 min. There were significant decreases in the ABI Fall 40 and RT 40 after training (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively). The MWD increased after training in 48 of the 49 patients. The average MWD increased from 134 +/- 13 m to 226 +/- 32 m after training (p < 0.001). The occlusion levels did not influence the results as training effects and hemodynamic parameters. Fourteen of 49 patients desired arterial reconstruction after exercise training.Patients with shorter RT 40's before training achieved greater increases in the MWD after training. In patients with an RT 40 under 12 min, exercise training is indicated. However, there is some discrepancy between the increase in MWD and the degree of satisfaction in individual patients.
