Clinical long-term results of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease. We investigated the long-term clinical results of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) and the influence of different parameters on the primary success rate, the rate of complications and the long-term outcome.We reviewed clinical and hemodynamic follow-up data of 166 consecutive patients treated with PTA in 1987 in our department.PTA improved the clinical situation in 79.4% of patients with iliac lesions and in 88.3% of patients with femoro-popliteal lesions. The clinical stage and ankle brachial index (ABI) post-interventional could be improved significantly (each P < 0.001), the same results were observed at the end of follow-up (each P < 0.001). Major complications occurred in 11 patients (6.6%). The rate of primary clinical long-term success for suprainguinal lesions was 55% and 38% after 5 and 10 years (femoro-popliteal 44% and 33%), respectively, the corresponding data for secondary clinical long-term success were 63% and 56% (60% and 55%). Older age (P = 0.017) and lower ABI pre-interventional (P = 0.019) significantly deteriorated primary clinical long-term success for suprainguinal lesions, while no factor could be identified influencing the outcome of femoro-popliteal lesions significantly.Besides an acceptable success rate with a low rate of severe complications, our results demonstrate favourable long-term clinical results of PTA in patients with PAOD.
