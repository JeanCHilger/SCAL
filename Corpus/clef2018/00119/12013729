Phosphorus magnetic resonance in studying energy metabolism in skeletal muscles. The present study objective involved evaluation of possibilities of magnetic resonance spectroscopy with phosphorus (31P-MRS) in diagnosis of metabolic disorders of skeletal muscles in patients with intermittent claudication, chronic heart failure and varicose disease of the lower extremities. In 20 patients with intermittent claudication, 10 patients with chronic heart failure, 10 patients with varicose disease and 10 volunteers, 31P-MRS was performed with 1.5 T MR system (Magnetom SP 63, Siemens). The following parameters were computed: phosphorus-creatinine index, intracellular pH in calf muscle, and time of half-recovery of the phosphorus-creatinine index. At rest, the phosphorus-creatinine indexes were similar in all groups pH values at rest did not vary either. During isotonic exercise the phosphorus-creatinine index in the control group remained uncharged. In patients with intermittent claudication, the phosphorus-creatinine index at peak of exercise was decreased by 26.1% (p < 0.001), in patients with varicose disease--by 25.6% (p < 0.001), in patients with chronic heart failure by 8% (p < 0.001). PCr recovery half-time was increased in all patients. The patient group with intermittent claudication showed a reverse correlation between the pressure index and the degree of phosphorus-creatinine index decrease.31P-MRS makes it possible to carry out non-invasive diagnosis of energy metabolic disorders of skeletal muscles in patients with impaired peripheral hemodynamics.
