Taurine suppresses development of atherosclerosis in Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits. While the hypocholesterolemic effects of taurine have extensively been studied using experimental animals, the anti-atherosclerotic effects of taurine have been given less attention. We examined the effect of taurine on atherosclerotic lesions in Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits. Treatment of WHHL rabbits with taurine (0.3% in drinking tap water) for 24 weeks decreased aortic lesions by 31%, estimated as intimal thickening. Taurine significantly decreased cholesteryl ester content of aortic arch, thoracic aorta, and abdominal aorta by 35, 43, and 54%, respectively. Concomitantly, activity of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), an enzyme responsible for cholesterol esterification, was also significantly decreased. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed decreased macrophages in the intima of taurine-treated rabbits. Taurine had no apparent effect on blood pressure and serum cholesterol levels. Contents of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), a marker of lipid peroxidation, was reduced in serum and aorta by 29 and 50%, respectively, when taurine was ingested. In addition, LDL from taurine-treated rabbits was resistant to copper-induced oxidative modification. These results revealed that taurine prevents development of atherosclerosis and that the anti-atherosclerotic effects of taurine are independent of serum cholesterol levels. The anti-oxidant action of taurine may be involved in inhibiting atherosclerosis in these rabbits.
