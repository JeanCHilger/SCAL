Local vascular complications after use of the hemostatic puncture closure device Angio-Seal. As an alternative to manual pressure techniques new systems for achieving arterial hemostasis after cardiac catheterization were developed. Here we report about the diagnosis and therapy of femoral artery complications after use of the closure device Angio-Seal, consisting of an intraarterial anchor and extravascular collagen plug.Angio-Seal was deployed in 350 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization. Vascular investigations after device application consisted of ankle/brachial-pressure-index measurement, duplex sonography, and angiography.Vascular complications occurred in 10 of 350 patients. In two patients complete occlusions of the superficial femoral artery required immediate vascular surgery. Stenoses of the superficial (five patients) and the common (three patients) femoral arteries were diagnosed in 8 cases. Of these 10 patients eight were obese, in 2 cases there was a further catheterization with Angio-Seal device application via the same femoral approach. Until now six patients underwent successful surgery: in 4 cases the whole Angio-Seal device was located intraarterially, there was 1 case of intima-dissection, and 1 case remained unclear due to a diagnostic delay of 7 months. In three patients with stenoses of the common femoral arteries without hemodynamic relevance no therapy was required.Occlusions or stenoses of femoral arteries after use of Angio-Seal can be diagnosed easily by duplex sonography. All hemodynamic relevant complications (n = 7 of 350 [2%]) concerned a puncture of superficial femoral arteries. In these patients vascular surgery seems to be an adequate therapy.
