The angiotensin-converting-enzyme insertion/deletion polymorphism is not a risk factor for peripheral arterial disease. An insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the gene for angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) is associated with ACE plasma levels and activity. Conflicting results have been reported about the relevance of this polymorphism for atherosclerotic vascular disease. The aim of the present study was to analyze the role of this polymorphism for peripheral arterial disease (PAD).The study was designed as a case-control study including 522 patients with documented PAD and 522 sex- and age-matched controls. ACE genotype was determined by size-analysis of polymerase chain reaction products.ACE genotype frequencies were similar between patients (II: 23.4% ID: 44.8%The ACE I/D polymorphism is not a significant risk factor for PAD.
