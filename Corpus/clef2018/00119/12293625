The CVI "on the crest of a new wave", but watch out for the pitfalls. Viewpoint. Although vaccines are historically the most cost-effective public health tools, most developed countries spend less than 1% of their total health budgets on prevention.  The Children's Vaccine Initiative (CVI), however, has been established at a time of renewed worldwide interest in vaccines, offering new opportunities for vaccine development.  Since the CVI has enough international leverage to pressure countries with large medical research and health care delivery facilities to cooperate with other parties in vaccine research, development, and dissemination, it should become a global coordinating agency, with the WHO/UNDP Program for Vaccine Development (PVD) working as a basic research arm and the WHO Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) focusing upon vaccine delivery.  The PVD is an important world coordinating force in medium- to long-term vaccine research which has recently expanded its mandate to include all major bacterial and viral diseases except AIDS.  The PVD has experience moving products from basic research into early clinical trials, while the CVI is better geared to organize phase III trials and develop relations with industry as the EPI keeps in touch with countries' needs and priorities.
