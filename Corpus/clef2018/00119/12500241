Improvement in lower-extremity peripheral arterial disease by nocturnal hemodialysis. A 42-year-old man with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) was referred for conversion to nocturnal hemodialysis (NHD) therapy from conventional hemodialysis (CHD) therapy because of refractory intermittent claudication secondary to peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The patient was initiated on CHD therapy in 1976 and subsequently had undergone two unsuccessful renal transplantations. While on CHD therapy, his clinical course was complicated by worsening vascular and soft-tissue calcification. Extensive dystrophic soft-tissue calcification was noted bilaterally in his hands, lower extremities, and sacral region, requiring surgical excision. Lower-extremity arterial Doppler scans documented vascular calcification and a pronounced decrease in peripheral arterial flow bilaterally. After conversion to NHD therapy (7.5 h/session five times weekly), the patient became symptom free and had significant clinical improvements in (1) hemodynamics, measured by clinic blood pressure and two-dimensional echocardiography, (2) biochemical profile, and (3) a sustained improvement in arterial Doppler flow measured by duplex Doppler ultrasound. We conclude that NHD was able to improve lower-extremity PAD in our patient. Further observational and interventional studies are required to investigate the therapeutic potential of NHD for the treatment of PAD in patients with ESRD.
