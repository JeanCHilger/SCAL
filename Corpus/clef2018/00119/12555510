Effect of naftidrofuryl on physiological walking distance in patients with intermittent claudication. To evaluate the physiological walking distance measured with the Peripheral Arterial Disease Holter Control device (PADHOC) after 12 months of treatment with naftidrofuryl in a double blind placebo controlled, parallel group study, in patients presenting with intermittent claudication.The outpatients selected were of both sexes, aged 40 to 80, with a chronic, stable intermittent claudication and an ankle brachial index between 0.60 and 0.90. They received naftidrofuryl 200 mg tid or placebo for 12 months. Outcome measures included physiological painfree and maximal walking distances using the PADHOC device. The principle of this device is the measurement of the intermalleolar distances using ultrasound telemetry. The PADHOC measures the walking distance and the speed profile in an ambulatory subject.182 patients were randomised and 168 entered the intention to treat analysis. The two groups were well matched for demographic variables, risk factors and history of vascular disease. After 12-month treatment, patients who received naftidrofuryl had a 107% improvement of geometric physiological pain-free walking distance versus 12% in the placebo group (P < 0.001) and 74% improvement of geometric maximal physiological walking distance versus 1% in the placebo group (P < 0.001).This study demonstrates the efficacy of naftidrofuryl versus placebo in patients with intermittent claudication using a new device measuring the walking distances of the patients in a more physiological way than the treadmill test.
