Bilateral pulmonary artery compression and obstruction by tumor: diagnosis by unusual Doppler flow patterns. Pulmonary artery obstruction may be caused by tumor within or external to the arteries. Presented here is a patient with life-threatening compromise in pulmonary flow that was caused by a pulmonary neoplasm. The Doppler echocardiogram showed subtotal narrowing of the right pulmonary artery and total occlusion of the left pulmonary artery. In addition, the beneficial effects of chemotherapy were documented by Doppler.
