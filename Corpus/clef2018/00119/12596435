Peripheral arterial disease--Part I: Diagnosis, epidemiology and risk factors. While knowledge about peripheral arterial disease (PAD) appears well disseminated, the condition still goes largely undiagnosed and untreated. We reviewed the current literature and found that PAD is a common condition that is equally prevalent in men and women. Most cases are asymptomatic and more so in women. Having PAD increases morbidity and mortality, as well as concomitant cardiovascular disease. Given the lack of symptoms in most patients, we recommend diagnosing PAD using non-invasive instruments such as the Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI). This paper deals with the diagnosis, epidemiology and risk factors for PAD.
