Evaluation of the patients with renovascular hypertension after percutaneous revascularization by Doppler ultrasonography. Evaluation of the effectiveness of percutaneous revascularization is based primarily on clinical criteria, and laboratory findings rather than direct investigation of luminal width. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the success of endovascular revascularization with serial Doppler ultrasound (US) examinations.19 patients (14 were atherosclerotic, five were with fibromuscular dysplasia) with suspected renovascular hypertension treated by percutaneous revascularization were included in a prospective study. Patients had 23 renal artery stenoses reducing the diameter by more than 50%. Doppler US examinations were performed before intervention, and 1 day, 3 and 6 months after intervention.Initial revascularization was technically successful in 21 of 23 stenoses (91.3%) (18 PTRA, three stent placement). Hypertension was cured in five atherosclerotic and in five fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) patients, and improved in four atherosclerotic patients. Residual stenosis was determined in six patients and the others were evaluated as normal by initial postprocedure Doppler US. As based on Doppler US, restenosis (>60%-narrowing) was depicted in four of six (66.6%) renal arteries with residual stenosis, and one of 15 (6.6%) normal renal arteries at 1 year. This difference in restenosis rates (residual stenosis vs. normal) was significant (P<0.05).Positive predictor for recurrence was a residual renal artery stenosis documented by Doppler US 1 day after percutaneous revascularization in atherosclerotic cases.
