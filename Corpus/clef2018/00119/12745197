Heart rate and pulse pressure amplification in hypertensive subjects. Although mean blood pressure (MBP) remains unmodified along the arterial tree, pulse pressure (PP) increases physiologically from the central to the peripheral arteries. Amplification of PP is known to be influenced by heart rate (HR), but the impact of this alteration has never been tested in patients with hypertension.A total of 712 hypertensive subjects, either treated or untreated, were divided into three classes of HR level. Carotid and brachial systolic blood pressure (SBP), carotid augmentation index, a marker of wave reflections, and carotid-brachial PP amplification were measured using applanation tonometry.Independent of age, sex, and antihypertensive drugs, subjects with HR >80 beats/min were characterized, in comparison with those with lower HR, by reduced carotid SBP, PP, and augmentation index, resulting in a significant increase in PP amplification. In men but not in women, this pattern was associated with higher values of brachial SBP and DBP and by higher incidences of elevated glycemia and atherosclerotic alterations. In the male population, PP amplifications was, independent of HR, associated with the presence of beta blocking agents (negative association) and elevated plasma glucose.Hypertensive men and women with high HR have significant PP amplifications, principally because of reduced central SBP and disturbed wave reflections. beta-blocking agents and plasma glucose independently alter PP amplification in men but not in women. Whether these opposite patterns influence the gender difference in cardiovascular risk should be prospectively studied.
