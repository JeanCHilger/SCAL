Use of abciximab during infrainguinal peripheral vascular interventions: initial experience. To investigate the use of abciximab as an adjunct during infrainguinal angioplasty.Abciximab was used in conjunction with recanalization techniques and angioplasty to treat stenoses or occlusions in 16 patients: 10 patients had high-grade stenoses or occlusions longer than 5 cm in the superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery, and six patients had stenoses or occlusions below the popliteal artery. All patients received a bolus of heparin after arterial access was achieved. Abciximab was administered by means of a weight-base nomogram that consisted of an initial bolus followed by an overnight infusion. Technical success was defined as a less than 30% residual stenosis after angioplasty. Patients were carefully followed up for possible postprocedural complications. Platelet counts were monitored for 24 hours.Technical success was achieved in 15 (94%) of 16 patients. One occlusion of the superficial femoral artery could not be crossed. There was a mean postprocedural increase of 0.23 in the ankle-brachial index. There was no significant effect on platelet count. Two minor complications occurred. One major complication occurred this was a groin hematoma, which required a blood transfusion.The use of abciximab as an adjunct during complex infrainguinal arterial interventions appears promising, on the basis of initial experience.
