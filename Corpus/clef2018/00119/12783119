Increased inflammatory status and higher prevalence of three-vessel coronary artery disease in patients with concomitant coronary and peripheral atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to determine whether patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and concomitant peripheral arterial disease (PAD) have a greater inflammatory status than those with CAD alone. To this aim, we evaluated PAD (ankle/brachial pressure index <0.9), and measured plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the soluble forms of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) in 234 patients who underwent coronary angiography. Median levels of CRP, IL-6 and sICAM-1 were higher in the CAD without PAD (n=134) and CAD+PAD (n=40) groups than in 60 patients without either disease ("controls"). Median CRP values were higher in patients with CAD+PAD than in patients with CAD alone (4.7 mg/L [1.5 7.6] vs 2.4 mg/L [0.9
