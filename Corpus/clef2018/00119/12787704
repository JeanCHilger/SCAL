Remote endarterectomy: first choice in surgical treatment of long segmental SFA occlusive disease? to report the long term results of remote superficial femoral artery endarterectomy (RSFAE) with the MollRing Cutter for the treatment of long segmental SFA occlusive disease.retrospective open study.from March 1994 to August 2000 183 RSFAEs were performed in 164 selected patients (105 males, 120 procedures) with a median age of 63 years (43-84 years). Indications for operation were disabling intermittent claudication in 129 procedures (70%), rest pain in 20 procedures (11%), and limb salvage in 34 procedures (19%). Follow up consisted of clinical evaluation, ankle-brachial index measurements and duplex scanning.the mean follow-up time was 29.3 months. The mean length of the endarterectomised SFAs was 31 cm (range, 17-45cm). The five year cumulative primary patency rate by means of life table analysis was 37.8+/-6.67% (SE). Percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty and surgical re-intervention were performed in twenty-nine and four patients respectively resulting in a primary assisted patency rate of 47.9+/-6.27%. Limb salvage was achieved in 30 of the 34 patients. Females had a statistically significant lower primary patency rate, i.e., 26 vs 45% (p -value=0.01).the long term results of remote SFA endarterectomy show that it is a safe, effective and durable, minimally invasive procedure. It also leaves open all other options for conventional bypass procedures. The five-year primary patency rate is at least similar to prosthetic above-knee bypass surgery.
