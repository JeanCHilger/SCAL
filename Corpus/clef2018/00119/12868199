Doppler ultrasound as the main diagnostic procedure in renovascular hypertension. Renovascular hypertension (RVH) accounts for 5-25% cases of secondary hypertension in children. It is the second most frequent cause of hypertension (second only to aortic coarctation), potentially treatable, provided that early diagnosis is made and no permanent organic lesions develop. No clinical symptoms are observed in more than 60% children with renovascular hypertension hypertension itself is diagnosed incidentally, in routine checkups. The patient is often hospitalised only after organic complications. The study aim was to verify the value of Doppler examination in the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension in children. In 2001, four out of 18 patients of the Nephrology Department examined due to hypertension were diagnosed with renovascular hypertension. In three of them, examination demonstrated aneurysmatic widening of renal artery with multiple stenoses, renal artery trunk stenosis, significant stenosis in abdominal aorta and in both renal arteries. In another case, stenosis of an additional renal artery was observed. All diagnoses were made with Doppler ultrasound and confirmed by angiography. Colour and spectral Doppler ultrasound examination is a non-invasive and valuable method of diagnosing hypertension in children.
