Local vascular responses affecting blood flow in postural tachycardia syndrome. Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is defined by orthostatic intolerance associated with abnormal upright tachycardia. Some patients have defective peripheral vasoconstriction and increased calf blood flow. Others have increased peripheral arterial resistance and decreased blood flow. In 14 POTS patients (13-19 yr) evenly subdivided among low-flow POTS (LFP) and high-flow POTS (HFP) we tested the hypothesis that myogenic, venoarteriolar, and reactive hyperemic responses are abnormal. We used venous occlusion plethysmography to measure calf venous pressure and blood flow in the supine position and when the calf was lowered by 40 cm to evoke myogenic and venoarteriolar responses and during venous hypertension by 40-mmHg occlusion to evoke the venoarteriolar response. We measured calf reactive hyperemia with plethysmography and cutaneous laser-Doppler flowmetry. Baseline blood flow in LFP was reduced compared with HFP and control subjects (0.8 +/- 0.2 vs. 4.4 +/- 0.5 and 2.7 +/- 0.4 ml.min-1.100 ml-1) but increased during leg lowering (1.2 +/- 0.5 ml.min-1. 100 ml-1) while decreasing in the others. Baseline peripheral arterial resistance was increased in LFP and decreased in HFP compared with control subjects (39 +/- 13 vs. 15 +/- 3 and 22 +/- 5 mmHg.ml-1. 100 ml. min) but decreased to 29 +/- 13 mmHg.ml-1.100 ml. min in LFP during venous hypertension. Resistance increased in the other groups. Maximum calf hyperemic flow and cutaneous flow were similar in all subjects. The duration of hyperemic blood flow was curtailed in LFP compared with either control or HFP subjects (plethysmographic time constant = 20 +/- 2 vs. 29 +/- 4 and 28 +/- 4 s cutaneous time constant = 60 +/- 25 vs. 149 +/- 53 s in controls). Local blood flow regulation in low-flow POTS is impaired.
