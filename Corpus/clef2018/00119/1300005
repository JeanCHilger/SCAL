The use of Doppler ultrasound of the renal arteries for the diagnosis of vasorenal hypertension at the outpatient stage. Ultrasonic dopplerography of the renal arteries was used to improve the differential diagnosis of arterial hypertension before hospitalization. Dopplerograms of the renal arteries of normal subjects were characterized by almost symmetrical parameters of the blood stream. In patients with vasorenal hypertension a marked asymmetry of the blood stream was seen with its reduction and qualitative changes in the dopplerogram on the side of the stenosed renal artery, that was confirmed by angiographic findings. Chronic pyelonephritis was dopplerographically characterized by hemodynamically insignificant asymmetry of the blood stream in the renal arteries with its reduction on the side of the involved kidney. In essential hypertension the type of asymmetry of blood stream parameters in the renal artery seemed similar to that in normal subjects.
