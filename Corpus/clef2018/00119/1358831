Combined two-dimensional and Doppler echographic examination of internal mammary artery grafts from the supraclavicular fossa. The noninvasive examination of internal mammary artery grafts is gaining importance with the increasing use of this vessel in the surgical treatment of coronary atherosclerosis of the left anterior descending artery. We studied 36 patients (37 internal mammary artery grafts) with combined two-dimensional and pulsed Doppler echography from the supraclavicular fossa. Adequate visualization and Doppler signals were obtained in 95% of arterial grafts. Twenty-four grafts leading to an area without evidence of old myocardial infarction or ischemia and 10 grafts leading to an area of old myocardial infarction but without evidence of ischemia on exercise showed a significant decrease of the peak systolic velocity and of the peak systolic velocity/peak diastolic velocity ratio as compared to the controls, which consisted of the contralateral internal mammary arteries in situ. One patient with a distally subtotally occluded mammary artery graft had a flow pattern different from the other bypassed mammary arteries. It seems that combined two-dimensional and pulsed Doppler echography is a useful method to evaluate the functional status of internal mammary artery grafts.
