Colour flow imaging of calf vein thrombosis. Ultrasound and more recently colour Doppler ultrasound has been successfully used in the diagnosis of lower limb venous occlusive disease. Colour Doppler ultrasound has shown promise in the diagnosis of calf vein thrombosis but to date there has been no prospective trial to specifically evaluate its potential. In view of this, we carried out a prospective trial of 50 patients comparing the accuracy of colour Doppler ultrasound with venography in the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis both above and below knee but in particular with respect to the detection of calf vein clot. Of the 50 patients studied, 10 had only one imaging modality performed as there were eight venographic failures and two ultrasonic failures. Comparison was only thus possible in 40 cases. As in previous studies, colour Doppler ultrasound was shown to be accurate in the diagnosis of thrombosis within the femoro-popliteal veins and had a sensitivity and specificity of 100% respectively. With respect to calf vein lesions, there was one false negative scan using the ultrasonic technique giving a sensitivity of 95%, specificity of 100% and accuracy of 97.5%. We feel colour Doppler ultrasound can and should be used as a first line alternative to venography and can be employed for the exclusion of both above and below knee deep venous thrombosis. Venography should now be reserved for those patients who are unsuitable for ultrasound examination or who have an equivocal ultrasound scan.
