Role of adenosine for reactive hyperemia in normal and stunned porcine myocardium. The role of adenosine for reactive hyperemia in normal and stunned myocardium was examined in 16 open-chest barbiturate-anesthetized pigs. Interstitial adenosine concentration was reduced or enhanced by intracoronary infusion of adenosine deaminase or the nucleoside transport inhibitor R 75231, respectively. In normal myocardium, adenosine deaminase reduced volume of hyperemia (Doppler flowmetry) after a 30-s left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) occlusion by 20% (6-34% P < 0.05), whereas R 75231 increased volume of hyperemia by 15% (2-24%
