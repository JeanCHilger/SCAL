Effect of the alpha-adrenergic blocker, doxazosin, on endothelial function and insulin action. Essential hypertension is associated with impairment of both endothelial function and insulin action, and this has provided rationale for the use of antihypertensive agents that are at least neutral, if not beneficial, in these areas. This study examines the effect of the alpha-adrenergic blocker, doxazosin, on endothelial function and insulin action. Sixteen patients with essential hypertension were recruited with 13 (3 men/10 women median age, 55 years
