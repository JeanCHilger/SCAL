LDL-apheresis up-regulates VEGF and IGF-I in patients with ischemic limb. Although it is known that LDL-apheresis improves ischemic limb seen in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD), the underlying mechanism(s) still remains unknown. We studied whether vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and/or insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels correlated with improvement of ischemic limbs after LDL-apheresis. Sixteen patients with PAOD (13 men, 3 women) were enrolled in our study. LDL-apheresis was performed 10 times (treated plasma 3,000 ml) for 5 weeks. Serum level of VEGF significantly increased from 262 +/- 171 pg/ml to 306 +/- 165 pg/ml before and after LDL-apheresis (P < 0.05). This value further increased up to 441 +/- 175 pg/ml 3 months after the end of this therapy (P < 0.01, compared with the basal value and P < 0.05, compared with the value at the end of 10-times session). Increased levels of VEGF paralleled increases in the ankle-brachial pressure index (ABI). After 10-times therapy, IGF-I significantly decreased (P < 0.05), but increased over the basal value 3 months after this therapy. Plasma fibrinogen statistically decreased and remained low for 3 months. The favorable effects of LDL-apheresis may be ascribed to up-regulation of VEGF and IGF-I associated with decreased fibrinogen levels.
