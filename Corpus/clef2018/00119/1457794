Doppler and duplex sonography of the vertebral arteries. In a prospective study 451 patients were examined with extracranial CW-Doppler sonography (mastoidal slope), suboccipital transcranial Doppler sonography and colour-coded duplex sonography to evaluate unusual vertebral arteries (hypoplasia, stenosis and occlusion). Colour duplex sonography was used as reference method. CW-Doppler sonography had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 27% for the detection of an unusual vertebral artery. For transcranial Doppler sonography these values are 38% and 58%. Our study showed that CW-Doppler is a useful screening examination for identifying pathological findings of vertebral arteries. In case of abnormalities in CW-Doppler, duplex sonography, especially colour-coded duplex sonography, should be added.
