Pulse pressure as a risk factor for peripheral vascular disease in type 2 diabetic patients. This study examined whether pulse pressure (PP) could be an independent predictor and associated with severity of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) in 396 type 2 diabetic patients (143 men and 253 women, aged 64.1 +/- 11.2 years). Peripheral vascular disease was diagnosed by an ankle-brachial index (ABI) < 0.90 and as severe PVD if ABI < 0.80. Association was evaluated before and after adjustment for age, sex, diabetes duration, hypertension, smoking, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), total cholesterol (TC), usage of insulin, and usage of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and for systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP), respectively. Results showed that PP increased from no (n = 348) to mild (n = 25) and severe (n = 23) PVD (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.001
