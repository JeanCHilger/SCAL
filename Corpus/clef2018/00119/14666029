Changes in left anterior descending coronary artery flow profiles after coronary artery bypass grafting examined by means of transthoracic Doppler echocardiography. We sought to investigate the changes of velocity profiles in the left anterior descending coronary artery after coronary artery bypass grafting using transthoracic Doppler echocardiography.Forty-five patients who received a bypass graft to the left anterior descending coronary artery were studied. Before coronary artery bypass grafting, Doppler velocity profiles of the distal left anterior descending coronary artery were recorded with transthoracic Doppler echocardiography. Peak systolic velocity, mean systolic velocity, peak diastolic velocity, mean diastolic velocity, total velocity time integral, systolic velocity time integral, and diastolic velocity time integral were measured. Three weeks after coronary artery bypass grafting, left anterior descending coronary artery antegrade flow in the distal portion of the anastomosis was obtained by using the same method. Coronary angiography was performed before and 3 weeks after coronary artery bypass grafting.The overall success rate of measuring the left anterior descending coronary artery flow was 60.0% preoperatively and 80.0% postoperatively. In 25 patients, in whom all parameters were obtained both before and after coronary artery bypass grafting, the following increased significantly after coronary artery bypass grafting: peak systolic velocity (14.86 +/- 7.50 vs 25.07 +/- 17.02 cm/s, P =.0045), mean systolic velocity (9.86 +/- 5.42 vs 18.03 +/- 12.94 cm/s, P =.0026), peak diastolic velocity (24.26 +/- 12.54 vs 48.28 +/- 31.66 cm/s, P =.0021), mean diastolic velocity (14.94 +/- 6.65 vs 30.36 +/- 20.71 cm/s, P =.0022), diastolic velocity time integral (7.22 +/- 2.88 vs 15.55 +/- 10.39 cm, P =.0009), total velocity time integral (10.50 +/- 4.48 vs 19.27 +/- 12.63 cm, P =.0034), and diastolic-to-systolic velocity time integral ratio (3.09 +/- 1.53 vs 4.97 +/- 2.75, P =.0044). Angiography showed graft patency and no significant change in left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis in all patients.Transthoracic Doppler echocardiography showed a significant increase in some parameters in left anterior descending coronary artery flow after coronary artery bypass grafting. Measurement of left anterior descending coronary artery flow by means of transthoracic Doppler echocardiography might be a noninvasive method to evaluate the effect of bypass grafting on the left anterior descending coronary artery.
