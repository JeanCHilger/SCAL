Dietary folate and vitamin B6 are independent predictors of peripheral arterial occlusive disease. It has been suggested that hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is an independent risk factor for peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD). However, the relationship between dietary folate and vitamin B6, cofactors in the metabolism of homocysteine (Hcy), and PAOD is unclear.To study the relationship between dietary folate and B6 and PAOD.Case-control population based study of 392 men older than 50 years living in Huntingdon, United Kingdom. PAOD, defined as an ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) < 0.9, was present in 86 (22%) of subjects. Folate, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 intakes were calculated by means of the EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer) food frequency questionnaire.Daily folate intake was significantly lower in case subjects (mean, 288 95% confidence interval [CI], 266-309 microg) than in control subjects (324In men older than 50 years, dietary folate and B6 intakes are independent predictors of PAOD. Longitudinal studies are required to determine whether dietary modification can reduce the incidence of PAOD in the population.
