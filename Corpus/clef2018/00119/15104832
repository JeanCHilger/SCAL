A nonincisional, Doppler-guided transvaginal approach to uterine artery identification and control of uterine perfusion. To determine the location and depth of uterine arteries from the vaginal fornix using a Doppler-guided nonincisional transvaginal approach.Observational study (Canadian Task Force classification II-3).Two women's health and fertility centers.One hundred nine healthy premenopausal women (age >18 yrs).Transvaginal uterine artery identification.After uterine size and position were determined, with a standard bivalve speculum in place, uterine arteries were located bilaterally using the DWL Multi-Dop B+ system with 8-MHz probe (Sipplingen, Germany) in toggle mode. Continuous Doppler mode was used to locate uterine arteries, and pulsed Doppler to estimate depth of the arteries from the vaginal fornix. The average uterine size was less than 8 weeks, with the largest measuring 18 weeks' gestational size. The right uterine artery could be identified between 8 and 11 o'clock positions, and was most commonly found at the 9 o'clock position (average depth 9.30 mm, range 4-17 mm). The left uterine artery could be identified between 1 and 4 o'clock positions and was most commonly found at the 3 o'clock position (average depth 8.88 mm, range 4-15 mm).Due to ease of identification of uterine arteries transvaginally, despite differences in parity, uterine size, and position, access to and occlusion of uterine arteries with a Doppler-guided device might offer an alternative to invasive procedures intended to occlude uterine artery blood flow in women with symptomatic uterine leiomyomas.
