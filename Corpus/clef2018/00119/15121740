Age- and fitness-related differences in limb venous compliance do not affect tolerance to maximal lower body negative pressure in men and women. Aging and chronic exercise training influence leg venous compliance. Venous compliance affects responses to an orthostatic stress its effect on tolerance to maximal lower body negative pressure (LBNP) in the elderly is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of age and fitness, a surrogate measure of exercise training, on calf venous compliance and tolerance to maximal LBNP in men and women. Forty participants, 10 young fit (YF
