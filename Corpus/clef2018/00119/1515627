The potentials and limits of blood-flow quantification in the peripheral arteries with MRT using a phase-mapping procedure. MRT is able to demonstrate arteries while MR angiography can quantify blood flow by a noninvasive method. In the present paper blood flow measurements were carried out in four selected cases on the basis of phase mapping. In 3 patients with lesions in the pelvis or thigh, angiography was performed in order to localise the stenosis or occlusion and this was followed by quantitative blood flow measurements. The results showed that angiography may not always provide all necessary information concerning a haemodynamically significant stenosis. The method may also be used for quantifying blood flow in the renal arteries and that it has significant advantages over the colour Doppler method.
