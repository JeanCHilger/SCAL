A cross-sectional study of peripheral arterial occlusive disease in Wanshoulu area, Beijing. In oder to study the prevalence of peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) and its risk factors in Chinese population, we conducted a cross-sectional epidemiology study on elderly residents living in the District of Wanshoulu, Beijing in 2001.A total of 2124 elderly (aged 60 - 95) were randomly selected in the area. The diagnostic criteria ankle arm index (AAI < 0.9) for PAOD was used in this study. The factors contributing to PAOD in this study were performed by logistic regression analysis under the diagnostic criteria of PAOD.The overall prevalence of PAOD was 15.91% with 11.77% in males and 19.22% in females. After standardization, the overall figures became 16.42% with 12.66% in males and 18.07% in females. Through logistic regression analysis, the factors, such as age (P = 0.001 RR = 1.06), gender (P = 0.001The prevalence of PAOD in this study was similar to the prevalence of the PAOD studies in the developed countries. The prevalence increased with advanced age and was higher in females than in males. The risk factors of PAOD such as hypertension, diabetes should be actively prevented and controlled.
