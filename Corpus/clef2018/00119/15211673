Fourier transformation of arterial Doppler waveforms of the lower extremity. Although it is well known that the normal, triphasic pulsatile arterial Doppler waveform changes in shape as flow is impaired, interpretation of the waveform has largely been subjective. We aimed to describe the Doppler waveforms of the lower extremity objectively using Fourier transformation.Sixty-eight zero-crossing detector arterial recordings from 25 lower extremities were grouped as follows: group 1, no ischemic symptoms with an ankle-brachial index (ABI) > 0.9 (n = 17, 8 limbs) group 2, no ischemic symptoms with ABI < 0.9 (n = 18, 5 limbs)Amplitudes of both the fundamental (H1) and second harmonic (H2) were predominant in group 1. In contrast, amplitudes of the H2 and H3 decreased with altered flow (p < 0.0001 for group 1 versus others). The phases of the H1 and H2 were delayed with altered flow (p < 0.05 for group 1 versus others). Phases of the H1 were different between group 2 and 4 (p < 0.05). The difference of phase between the H3 and H1 was shortened with altered flow (p < 0.05 for group 1 or 2 versus group 4). Multivariate analysis revealed that the relative amplitudes of the H2 and H3, the phases of the H1 and H2, and the relative phase of the H3 were significant discriminators among the groups.Abnormal waveforms could be characterized by the predominant amplitude of the H1, phase delay of the H1 and H2, and shortening of the relative phase of the H3. These parameters may be useful in the evaluation of Doppler waveforms in patients with peripheral arterial disease.
