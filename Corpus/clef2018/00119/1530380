Evaluation of microcirculation in the tumor-bearing liver of rabbits by laser-Doppler flowmetry. Hemodynamic changes in normal liver tissue and in intrahepatic tumors (Vx2 carcinoma) after occlusion of the hepatic arterial branch or the portal branch (ex. 1), and with intrahepatic arterial infusion of vasoactive agents (ex. 2) were studied in rabbits by a laser-Doppler flowmeter. Ex. 1: After occlusion of the hepatic arterial branch to the main lobe, laser-Doppler flow (LDF) in main lobe normal tissue decreased by 11 +/- 11% in the control group, 37 +/- 37% in group Ia (tumors were 10-20 mm in diameter) and 49 +/- 37% in group Ib (tumors were 25-50 mm), so it seemed that the proportion of portal blood flow in the normal tissue microcirculation decreased with tumor growth. The tumor LDF decreased by 88 +/- 13%. After occlusion of the portal branch, the normal tissue LDF in the main lobe decreased and then recovered slightly (most evident in the control group and least in group Ib). This recovery was probably due to the hepatic arterial buffer response. The tumor LDF decreased by 36 +/- 10% in group Ia and 11 +/- 17% in group Ib. There was no difference between group I (tumors were implanted directly) and group II (tumors were implanted via portal vein). Ex. 2: Adenosine and prostaglandin E1 increased blood flow in the normal tissue and decreased the tumor blood flow, while angiotensin II had the opposite effect. Vasoactive agents can be used to selectively increase or decrease tumor blood flow and are available as adjuvants for the treatment of liver tumors. Adenosine may enhance the selective tumor heating in local hyperthermia.
