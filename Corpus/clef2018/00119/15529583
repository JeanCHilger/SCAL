The use of light reflection rheography in diagnosing venous disease and arterial microcirculation. The use of light reflection rheography (LRR) has reached an important level in the past few years. Using the originally construed and conceived RRL 001 device, we present the basic principles, the working technique and the limits of this method. We will use two magnetic amplifiers, one for the finger tip, which measures the capillary blood flow at this level and a venous magnetic amplifier which measures the blood flow in the venous plexuses at a 1-2 mm depth. The detection of the blood flow in the subcutaneous (hypodermic) venous areas leads to the diagnosis of profound thrombophlebitis and venous valves insufficiency. The detection of the capillary flow in the finger tip, its presentation as a curve, measuring the pressure of the inter digital arteries (using Riva Rocci method), establishing the index of systolic pressure make possible the understanding of the gravity of the existing hemodynamic disorders (especially in what concerns the Raynaud syndromes), the supervision of the original disease and the efficiency of the treatment. Weindorf was the first one to use the RRL technique in medicine in 1985 and, after 1997, it has been developed through Sproule's work. Within The Medical Clinic of the Municipal Hospital, a light reflection rheograph has been built and forwarded as innovation. The device has been used for 2 years in the diagnosis of venous disorders and peripheral microcirculation disorders. In this article we present the principles of the LRR examination of the lower limb venous system and of the microcirculation of the fingers of the upper limbs, an examination based upon our own experience which includes 72 examinations.
