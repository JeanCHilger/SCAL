Assessment of toe blood pressure is an effective screening method to identify diabetes patients with lower extremity arterial disease. The authors evaluated a screening program for lower extremity arterial disease (LEAD) in diabetic patients and focused on the value of toe blood pressure assessment. They recruited 437 subjects, ages 30-70 years (134 healthy controls, 166 type 1 and 137 type 2 diabetic patients control [Ctr], DM1, and DM2) with no previous history of LEAD. They were enrolled in a longitudinal study with a planned follow-up of 10 years. Patients were consecutively enrolled from outpatient diabetes units of 2 university hospitals. Subjects were screened with respect to peripheral circulation by use of established noninvasive techniques. These included arm, ankle (AP), and toe (TP) blood pressure measurements
