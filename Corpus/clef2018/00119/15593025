A heap of trouble. Resistant hypertension and aneurysm of the renal artery. A 47-year-old female, was referred to our renal and vascular ultrasound unit by the cardiologists, because of a long history of uncontrolled hypertension resistant to multiple antihypertensive drug treatment. The question was if the patient had a secondary form of hypertension, i.e. a renal artery stenosis. An accurate evaluation by echo-color Doppler ultrasound displayed an aneurysm located at the bifurcation of the right renal artery. The surgical correction of the aneurysm normalized the arterial pressure and avoided a rupture, which is always a dramatic event.
