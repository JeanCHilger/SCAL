A model for post-occlusive reactive hyperemia as measured with laser-Doppler perfusion monitoring. To facilitate the quantitative analysis of post-occlusive reactive hyperaemia (PORH), measured with laser-Doppler perfusion monitoring (LDPM) on extremities, we present a flow model for the dynamics of the perfusion of the tissue during PORH, based on three parameters: two time constants (tau1 and tau2) and the ratio of the maximum flux and the resting flux. With these three constants quantitative comparisons between experiments will be possible and, therefore, we propose to adopt this approach as future standard. For this reason, we also developed a computer program to perform the fit of the model to measured data.
