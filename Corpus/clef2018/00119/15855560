The patients were categorized as high-risk subjects according to the International Consensus on the Diabetic Foot.

Ulcers present during the recruitment had healed in 585 (82%) subjects who followed the advice, but in only 269 (50%) subjects who did not. A significantly larger proportion of subjects who did not follow the advice developed new problems (26%) and required surgical procedures (14%) compared with those who followed the advice (5 and 3%, respectively).Strategies such as intensive management and foot care education are helpful in preventing newer problems and surgery in diabetic foot disease.
