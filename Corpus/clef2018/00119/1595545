Intravascular ultrasound in coronary atherosclerosis: a new approach to clinical assessment. Intravascular ultrasound evaluation of the coronary arteries by means of a selective coronary catheter attached to an ultrasound unit has afforded precise depiction of coronary lumen diameter and area at the level of the catheter tip. The arterial wall at this level can be evaluated for lipid, fibrous tissue, calcification, wall dissections, and intraluminal thrombi. The technique has the advantage over coronary angioscopy and angiography in that it does not require infusions or injections to allow visualization, and it has the ability to depict the inside of the arterial wall. The current disadvantages include the inability to visualize the vessel segments distal to the catheter tip. Three-dimensional reconstruction techniques allow depiction of the segment of the artery traversed by the catheter tip. The use of Doppler ultrasound imaging provides information on coronary flow velocities through coronary obstructions. Intravascular ultrasound images may provide information that complements the coronary arteriogram and may have an impact on patient care and clinical investigation strategies.
