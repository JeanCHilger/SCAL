Ankle-brachial index and subclinical cardiac and carotid disease: the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis. The authors studied associations between ankle-brachial index (ABI) and subclinical atherosclerosis in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Participants included 3,458 women (average age = 62.6 years) and 3,112 men (average age = 62.8 years) who were free of clinically evident cardiovascular disease. Measurements included ABI, carotid artery intima-media thickness, and coronary artery calcium assessed with computed tomography. Five ABI categories were defined: <0.90 (definite peripheral arterial disease (PAD)), 0.90-0.99 (borderline ABI), 1.00-1.09 (low-normal ABI), 1.10-1.29 (normal ABI), and > or =1.30 (high ABI). Compared with that in men with normal ABI, significantly higher internal carotid artery intima-media thickness was observed in men with definite PAD (1.58 vs. 1.09 p < 0.001), borderline ABI (1.33 vs. 1.09
