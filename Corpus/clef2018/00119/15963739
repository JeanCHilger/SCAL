Intermittent claudication: exercise-increased walking distance is not related to improved cardiopulmonary fitness. To assess if exercise training improves the symptoms of intermittent claudication by improvement in cardiopulmonary fitness.Claudication distance (CD), maximum walking distance (MWD), calf endurance (repetitive heel raises), cardiovascular fitness (VO2 peak), and ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) were measured in 16 subjects with intermittent claudication before, and following an 8-week treadmill training programme.Training resulted in a median increase in CD of 65.5 m (p<0.01), MWD of 339.5 m (p<0.001) and HR of 19 (p<0.03). Notably, improvements in MWD correlated with those in HR (p=0.001 R=0.75). There was no training-associated change in VO2 peak (median increase of only 0.35 ml/kg/minIn this study, overall improvement in claudication was not related to an improvement in cardiopulmonary fitness.
