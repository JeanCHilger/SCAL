Correlates for a low ankle-brachial index in elderly Chinese. This study examines the prevalence of atherosclerosis (using ankle-brachial index (ABI) value <0.9) and associated socioeconomic and lifestyle factors in elderly Chinese, adjusting for presence of cardiovascular diseases and body mass index, in a cross-sectional survey of 1999 men and 1999 women aged 65 years and over living in the community. A questionnaire containing information regarding socioeconomic status, medical history and lifestyle factors was administered. Measurement included height, weight, percentage body fat using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and ABI. The Hong Kong population (2000) age adjusted prevalence of ABI <0.9 was 5.3% for men and 11.0% for women. In multivariate analysis, old age, female gender, presence of cardiovascular diseases, cognitive impairment, prolonged 6 m walk, smoking habit and alcohol intake were positively associated with ABI <0.9, while negative associations were observed with Vitamin C intake >100 mg per day, with the lowest OR for the range 141-190 mg (OR 0.4). Physical activity level, and self rated higher social standing in the community, while significant in univariate analysis, were not included as independent significant factors in the multivariate model. Lifestyle factors and the female gender were independent risk factors for atherosclerosis in the elderly Chinese population.
