Noninvasive tests of atherosclerotic burden in asymptomatic people with high cardiovascular risk. Objective of cardiovascular prevention to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events and morbidity and prolong the quality of life. Strategy of prevention is identification of high risk individuals, and action to reduce their risk factors levels. Noninvasive tests such as carotis artery duplex scanning, ultrasound-based endothelial function studies, ankle-brachial blood pressure ratios, coronary calcium score by electron-beam CT, and high-sensitivity testing for C-reactive protein offer the potential for directly and indirectly measuring atherosclerosis in asymptomatic people. If a patient is found to have abnormal non-invasive test, this patient can be elevated to a higher risk category.
