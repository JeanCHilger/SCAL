Assessment of arterial stiffness index as a clinical parameter for atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. The aim of the present study was to assess the feasibility and usefulness of the arterial stiffness index (ASI) measured non-invasively by computerized oscillometry and by comparing it with the pulse wave velocity (PWV).The study group comprised 60 consutive patients who underwent coronary angiography and whose aorto-femoral PWV were obtained with a Judkins catheter. The ASI was obtained using Cardio Vision MS-2000 (IMDP, Las Vegas, NV, USA): (i) baseline (ASI-B) (ii) hyperemia induced by compression of the arm with cuff pressure for 5 min (ASI-H)It is feasible and useful to use the ASI for detection of atherosclerotic coronary disease. The findings of ASI-H suggests that in addition to stiffening of the arterial wall itself, the impairment of flow mediated vasodilation, because of endothelial dysfunction, further increases the arterial stiffness.
