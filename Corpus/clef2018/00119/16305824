Noninvasive arterial measurements of vascular damage in healthy young adults: relation to coronary heart disease risk. There is an increasing interest in noninvasive measurements of early structural or functional changes in large arteries such as pulse wave velocity (PWV), carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), and augmentation index (AIx). These measurements may be applied in etiologic or prognostic research. The role of the AIx as a marker of cardiovascular risk has not fully been established. Our aim was to study whether AIx is related to coronary heart disease (CHD) risk and to compare the strength of the relations of AIx, PWV, and CIMT with cardiovascular risk in healthy young adults.Our study included 224 men and 273 women (mean age 28 years, range 27-30 years) from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Young Adults (ARYA) study. Cardiovascular risk profile was determined and CHD risk was estimated using the Framingham risk score. AIx, PWV and CIMT were measured using standard methods. Data were analyzed in strata of gender using linear regression models.In men, PWV and CIMT were most strongly related to CHD risk. The increase in CHD risk per standard deviation increase in measurement was 0.24%/m/s, 95% CI (0.010.33) and 0.32%/mm, 95% CI (0.08In young men, PWV and CIMT are better measures of CHD risk than AIx. In women, AIx, PWV and CIMT estimate CHD risk equally well.
