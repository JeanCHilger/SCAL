Relationship between oxidative stress parameters and atherosclerotic signs in the carotid artery of stable renal transplant patients. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) may participate in atheroma plaque formation, which may be noninvasively diagnosed by Doppler ultrasound of carotid artery. We sought to determine the relationship between the presence of carotid artery lesions and oxidative parameters to identify factors that may influence these lesions in renal transplant patients. Fifty renal transplanted patients with stable renal function and without diabetes mellitus were studied for more than 1 year posttransplantation. Echo Doppler examination of the carotid artery was performed to assess the intimal media thickness (IMT), atheroma plaques, calcification, and stenosis. Data were collected on oxidative parameters: malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GR), and lipid profile. The serum GPx level among patients without atheroma plaques, calcification, or stenosis was higher than in those with ultrasound signs. The LDL cholesterol fraction was lower in patients with no ultrasound signs of atherosclerotic lesions total cholesterol values showed the same behavior. In conclusion, transplanted patients with atheromatous plaques, calcification, and carotid stenosis have a greater degree of hypercholesterolemia and lower antioxidant activity (lower GPx). Recipient age was the principal risk factor for the presence of increased IMT, atheroma plaque, calcification, and/or stenosis of carotid artery in renal transplant patients.
