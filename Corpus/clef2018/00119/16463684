Assessment of coronary flow velocity reserve by noninvasive transthoracic Doppler echocardiography in patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries. The measurement of coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) by transthoracic Doppler echocardiography (TTDE) with invasive intracoronary Doppler flow wire technique (ICD) was validated and the pathological factors which influence CFVR in patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries were analyzed. CFVR was determined successfully in left anterior descending artery (LAD) in 37 of 40 patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries (men 22, women 15, age 20-75 years, mean age 54 +/- 12 years). Coronary flow velocity was measured in the distal LAD by TTDE with contrast enhancement at baseline and during intravenous adenosine infusion of 140 microg/kg per min within 48 h after ICD technique. Average peak velocity at baseline (APVb), average peak velocity during hyperemia (APVh) and CFVR determined from TTDE were correlated closely with those from ICD measurements (APVb: y = 0.64x + 5.04, r = 0.86, P < 0.001 APVh: y = 0.63x + 14.36, r = 0.82, P < 0.001
