Noninvasive diagnosis of the state of lower extremities arterial vascular bed in patients with diabetes of type 2. Complex noninvasive investigation of arterial vascular bed and microcirculation of lower extremities was carried out in 87 patients with diabetes and 47 patients with atherosclerosis obliterans of lower extremities without diabetes. Color duplex scanning allowed to detect occlusive-stenotic and nonocclusive changes of arterial vascular bed in patients with type 2 diabetes. Calcinated atherosclerotic plaques in patients with type 2 diabetes more often localize in superficial femoral, popliteal arteries and arteries of the calf. Such plaques are twice as frequent among patients with atherosclerosis obliterans with diabetes compared with those without diabetes. Laser Doppler flowmetry with test of reactive postocclusion hyperemia and positional test in patients with atherosclerosis obliterans and type 2 diabetes allows to reveal more pronounced disturbances of microcirculation compared with patients without diabetes. In patients with type 2 diabetes with hemodynamically insignificant stenoses of arteries of lower extremities laser doppler flowmetry and transcutaneous measurement of oxygen tension in skin of a foot reveal disturbances of microcirculation.
