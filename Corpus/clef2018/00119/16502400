Correlation between noninvasive and endovascular Doppler in patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis: a pilot study. Considerable interest exists in using endovascular techniques for assessing the renal circulation. The vasomotor response of the renal circulation in patients with hypertension and severe atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis was evaluated. Sixteen patients (5 men and 11 women) with a mean age of 73.2+/-7.1 years (range, 59-82 years) underwent noninvasive renal duplex ultrasonography and endovascular flow wire evaluation. The flow wire was positioned in the main renal artery distal to the stenosis and used to examine the reactivity of the renal circulation in response to intra-arterial papaverine before and after percutaneous revascularization. Resistive index was computed as (MPV - EDV)/MPV, where MPV is the maximum peak velocity and EDV is the end-diastolic velocity. Renal flow reserve was defined as the ratio of peak hyperemic response to baseline flow. Intervention was technically successful in 18/18 arteries. Heart rate (69+/-11 vs. 65+/-10 beats/min P=NS) and systolic blood pressure (168+/-19 vs. 163+/-24 mm Hg
