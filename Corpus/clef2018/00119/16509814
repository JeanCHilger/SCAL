Screening and risk stratification of patients with the metabolic syndrome and diabetes. The metabolic syndrome is a clustering of risk factors known to promote or increase the risk for development of cardiovascular disease. Recent estimates demonstrate that approximately one-third of the adult population of developed countries are characterized with metabolic syndrome by different definitions. Metabolic syndrome, even in the absence of diabetes, is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and total mortality, as well as an increased risk for the development of diabetes. Patients with diabetes are considered a cardiovascular risk equivalent, and warrant aggressive management of underlying risk factors to optimize prevention of cardiovascular disease. Initial evaluation of coronary heart disease risk involves global risk estimation using Framingham or other algorithms for risk prediction. Furthermore, consideration of screening for novel risk factors, such as C-reactive protein, as well as subclinical atherosclerosis (as assessed by carotid ultrasound, computed tomography or ankle-brachial index), can further refine the estimation of future cardiovascular disease risk. The presence of subclinical atherosclerosis or elevated levels of C-reactive protein can potentially modify recommended treatment goals for lipid and other cardiovascular risk factors.
