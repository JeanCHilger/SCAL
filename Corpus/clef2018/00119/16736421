Practice patterns in the management of arteriovenous fistula stenosis: a northern Italian survey. Clinical practice for stenosis detection and treatment in arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) varies widely and is largely dictated by local customs and expertise.In May 2003, a questionnaire was sent to 32 hemodialysis (HD) facilities in north-eastern Italy, to assess the prevalence of patients with an AVF the screening criteria for stenosisThe response rate was 87% 2895 prevalent patients were evaluated, 86% with an AVF. All facilities routinely screened for stenosisOur survey shows that, as in 2003, the vast majority of patients in north-eastern Italy were dialyzed with an AVF. Screening for stenosis was universally adopted, though most facilities relied on clinical examination and surrogate access blood flow rate markers. All nephrologists agreed to pre-emptive stenosis correction, and surgery retained a relevant role in the treatment of stenosed and thrombosed AVFs.
