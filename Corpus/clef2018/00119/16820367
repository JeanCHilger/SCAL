Ankle-brachial index and extent of atherothrombosis in 8891 patients with or at risk of vascular disease: results of the international AGATHA study. AGATHA (a Global Atherothrombosis Assessment) was designed to assess the extent of atherothrombosis and the use of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in vascular patients. The principal hypotheses were that (1) in diseased patients, a low ABI was related to the number and site of vascular beds affected and (2) in at-risk patients without disease, a low ABI was related to the number of risk factors present.Patients were recruited consecutively by 482 clinicians in 24 countries and the ABI measurement was performed at a single visit. Of 8891 patients recruited, 1792 were defined as at risk and 7099 as with disease. Of the with-disease patients, 65.2% had one arterial bed affected, 27.6% two and 7.1% all three. Abnormal ABI (< or =0.9) was present in 30.9% of at-risk and 40.5% of with-disease patients. A lower ABI was weakly associated with an increasing number of risk factors in at-risk patients (r=-0.056, P=0.02) and with the site and number of arterial beds affected in with-disease patients (P<0.001).This large international study confirms that atherothrombotic disease often occurs at more than one site. The ABI is related to the risk factor profile and to the site and extent of atherothrombosis.
