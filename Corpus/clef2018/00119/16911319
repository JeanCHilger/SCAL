Venous leg congestion treated with distal venous drainage during peripheral extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Distal venous drainage during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) via femoral cannulation is described. It was performed to relieve distal venous congestion due to obstruction by the venous cannula. Venous drainage was performed with an 11 Fr introducer catheter connected as a T to the main venous line. Its effectiveness was confirmed by clinical examination and Doppler ultrasound in a patient presenting with acute myocarditis. In addition to distal limb perfusion during ECMO, this technique appears safe and simple for adequate distal limb drainage, and can be useful in cases where a change of cannulas is not possible.
