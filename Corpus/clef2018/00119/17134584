Increased brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity is associated with impaired endothelial function in patients with coronary artery disease. Pulse wave velocity and flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) are widely used as noninvasive modalities for evaluating atherosclerosis. However, it is not known whether pulse wave velocity is related to FMD in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate the alteration in brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) and endothelial function in CAD patients.Thirty-three patients with CAD and thirty control subjects were recruited for this study. baPWV was measured non-invasively using a VP 1000 automated PWV/ABI analyzer (PWV/ABI, Colin Co. Ltd., Komaki, Japan). Endothelial function as reflected by FMD in the brachial artery was assessed with a high-resolution ultrasound device.baPWV was increased in CAD patients compared with control subjects [(1756.1 +/- 253.1) cm/s vs (1495.3 +/- 202.3) cm/s, P < 0.01]. FMD was significantly reduced in CAD patients compared with control subjects [(5.2 +/- 2.1)% vs (11.1 +/- 4.4)%, P < 0.01]. baPWV correlated with FMD (r = -0.68, P < 0.001). The endothelium-independent vasodilation induced by sublingual nitroglycerin in the brachial artery was similar in the CAD group compared with the control group.CAD is associated with increased baPWV and endothelial dysfunction. Increased baPWV parallels diminished endothelial function. Our data therefore suggest that baPWV can be used as a noninvasive surrogate index in clinical evaluation of endothelial function.
