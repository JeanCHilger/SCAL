Preliminary results of subintimal angioplasty for limb salvage in lower extremities with severe chronic ischemia and limb-threatening ischemia. This study examined the hypothesis that superficial femoral artery (SFA) subintimal angioplasty (SI-PTA) can maintain limb salvage with minimal complications in patients with symptomatic occlusive arterial disease.From March 1, 2004, until April 28, 2006, 78 patients with rest pain (62.2%), gangrene (25.6%), or severe progressive claudication (12.2%) were treated consecutively with 82 SFA SI-PTAs (4 bilateral). The mean age was 59 +/- 1.2 years, and 21 (27%) of the patients were female. All patients were treated in the operating room under local anesthesia by using fluoroscopic guidance, and the percentage SFA that was occluded was measured during the diagnostic portion of the procedure. Selective stent placement was performed after successful recanalization of the occluded arterial segments. Patients were treated with chronic aspirin and clopidogrel bisulfate for 3 months and followed up at 30 days and then every 3 months with physical examination and arterial duplex scan.Of the 82 SFA SI-PTA attempts, 76 (92%) were initially successful, with an increase in the ankle-brachial index from 0.46 +/- 0.02 to 0.88 +/- 0.01 (P < .001). Five of the six patients with a failed SFA SI-PTA were female, two of the six had had previous bypass attempts, and one of the six had had a previous SFA SI-PTA attempt by another physician. Forty-nine (64%) of the 76 initially successful SFA SI-PTAs required placement of a stent, and 43 (56.5%) of the successful 76 SFA SI-PTAs required additional PTA of 1 or more arterial segments. The group treated with a successful SFA SI-PTA had 42.5% +/- 3.5% SFA occlusion, compared with 82% +/- 10% (P < .05) in the group with a failed attempt at SFA SI-PTA. Two of the six patients with initial SI-PTA failure underwent leg amputation within 30 days, three were treated with successful leg bypass surgery, and one was lost to follow-up. Of the 76 successful SFA SI-PTAs, 5 (6.5%) failed within 90 days, and the patients were treated successfully with leg bypass surgery. Of the 71 limbs with patent SI-PTAs at 90 days, 68 have remained patent with a mean follow-up 10.4 +/- 0.7 months (range, 2-24 months). Three of the 71 SFA SI-PTAs failed between 4 and 7 months (mean, 5 +/- 0.7 months): 1 patient was treated with successful bypass surgery, 1 patient is currently considering further intervention, and 1 patient was treated with amputation. Ten (14%) of the 71 successful SFA SI-PTAs required limited PTA for asymptomatic restenosis, as identified by the arterial duplex scan (7.4 +/- 1.4 months range, 2-16 months). There were no perioperative deaths, and three patients have died during follow-up with patent SFA SI-PTAs (9.3 +/- 1.4 months).These data suggest that SFA SI-PTA can be successfully used for limb salvage with minimal morbidity and mortality in a group of patients with severe lower extremity occlusive vascular disease.
