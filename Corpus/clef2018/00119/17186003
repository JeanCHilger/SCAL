Selective AT1 receptor antagonism enhances sympathetically mediated vasoconstriction in man. The vasoconstrictive action of angiotensin II (AII) is partly, sympathetically mediated and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors appear to exert a sympatholytic effect. We examine the effect of an orally administered, selective AT(1) receptor antagonist (losartan 50 mg) on sympathetically mediated vasoconstriction in healthy volunteers in an observer blind crossover study. Seven healthy, normotensive volunteers (21-32 years), were studied on two occasions at the end of each 6-week treatment period (losartan or placebo). Forearm blood flow (FABF) (ml/dl forearm/min) was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography during the application of lower body negative pressure (LBNP) (-20 cm H(2)O) and at the end of each incremental infusion of norepinephrine (60, 120, and 240 pmol/min). Comparison of blood flow changes was by repeated measures analysis of variance P<0.05 was taken as statistically significant. Losartan did not alter blood pressure compared to placebo. It did significantly enhance LBNP-induced vasoconstriction in both the left arm compared to placebo (-36.6+/-3.4 vs -23.5+/-3.3%
