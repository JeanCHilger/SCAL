Amino acids stimulate leg muscle protein synthesis in peripheral arterial disease. Older patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and intermittent claudication have impaired walking ability resulting from reduced lower extremity blood flow. Evidence suggests that leg muscle abnormalities may also contribute to walking intolerance in claudicants. In healthy elderly people, leg muscle protein synthesis can be augmented by nutritional supplementation with amino acids preliminary data suggest that this increases muscle mass, walking ability, and functional status. In this study, we investigated whether amino acid supplementation would improve leg muscle protein synthesis in elderly PAD subjects, given that reduced leg blood flow might restrict the availability of amino acids to muscle.Two groups participated in the study: a group of 11 claudicants (mean age, 62 years mean ankle-brachial index, 0.62Calf blood flow was reduced in the PAD subjects compared with controls (1.44 +/- 0.53 mL/min per 100 mg of tissue vs 2.40 +/- 0.57 mL/min per 100 mg of tissue P = .005Despite reduced leg blood flow, elderly PAD patients synthesize calf muscle protein in the basal state in a fashion similar to that in healthy elderly people. More importantly, administration of exogenous amino acids produces a significant increase in protein synthesis in these patients that is also equivalent to that in healthy elderly people. Our goal is to use these results as the basis for an intervention study to determine whether long-term oral amino acids, by augmenting calf muscle protein synthesis, increase calf muscle mass, walking ability, and functional status in elderly claudicants.
