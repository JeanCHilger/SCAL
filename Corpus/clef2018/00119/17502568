Sustained benefit at 2 years of primary femoropopliteal stenting compared with balloon angioplasty with optional stenting. Primary stenting with self-expanding nitinol stents of the superficial femoral artery yielded improved morphological and clinical results compared with balloon angioplasty with optional stenting until 12 months in a randomized controlled trial. We now report 2-year data on restenosis and clinical outcomes of these patients.Of 104 patients with chronic limb ischemia and superficial femoral artery obstructions, 98 (94%) could be followed up until 2 years after intervention for occurrence of restenosis (>50%) by duplex ultrasound and for clinical and hemodynamic outcome by treadmill walking distance and ankle brachial index. Restenosis rates at 2 years were 45.7% (21 of 46) versus 69.2% (36 of 52) in favor of primary stenting compared with balloon angioplasty with optional secondary stenting by an intention-to-treat analysis (P=0.031). Consistently, stenting (whether primary or secondary n=63) was superior to plain balloon angioplasty (n=35) with respect to the occurrence of restenosis (49.2% versus 74.3%At 2 years, primary stenting with self-expanding nitinol stents for the treatment of superficial femoral artery obstructions yields a sustained morphological benefit and a trend toward clinical benefit compared with balloon angioplasty with optional stenting.
