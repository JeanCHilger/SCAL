The prevalence of peripheral arterial disease in high risk subjects and coronary or cerebrovascular patients. Atherosclerosis is a generalized disease with considerable overlap of its coronary, carotid, and peripheral manifestations. As an indicator of multifocal atherosclerosis, peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is emerging as an important aid in risk stratification of patients with coronary artery (CAD) or cerebrovascular disease (CVD). Therefore, the aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of PAD in high risk subjects and its ability to identify coronary or cerebrovascular patients. A total of 952 (63.3% male age 63.7 +/-10.7 years) patients at high cardiovascular risk (>or=2 risk factors), or with evidence of CAD or CVD were screened for PAD by means of ankle-brachial index (ABI) assessment
