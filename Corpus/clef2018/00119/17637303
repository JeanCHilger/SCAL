The relationship between high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and peripheral artery disease. To investigate the association between high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and peripheral arterial disease.The study population comprised 643 subjects aged at least 40 years in whom both CRP and ankle-brachial index were measured. The survey included information on demographic characteristics, clinical examinations and ankle-brachial index (ABI). Ankle-brachial index (ABI) < 0.9 was diagnostic of PAD.64 subjects (10%) were diagnosed as PAD. The prevalence of current smoking, hypertension, diabetes, low HDL cholesterol and history of cardiovascular disease in the participants with PAD were higher than without (P < 0.05). The prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and history of cardiovascular disease was higher in subjects with high CRP (P < 0.05). In logistic regression analyses, the moderate CRP group and high CRP group had a two-fold higher OR compared with the low CRP group. The P-trend across CRP groups was statistically significant (P = 0.036). High log-transformed hs-CRP level was significantly related to PAD after adjustment for the cardiovascular risk factors mentioned above (P = 0.007).hs-CRP is related to PAD and high level hs-CRP is an independent risk factor for PAD in Chinese adults aged 40 years and more.
