Diagnosis of carotid artery sclerosis with Doppler ultrasound. Description of the method and a prospective comparison with arteriography. The ultrasound Doppler method for examination of the carotid artery is described. Out of a total of 370 patients examined with ultrasound Doppler for suspected arteriosclerosis in the carotid artery in 1988, 27 were also submitted to digital subtraction arteriography (DSA). The accuracy of the ultrasound examination was compared with DSA 90% (43/48) when differentiating between normal and affected carotid arteries, and 85% (41/48) when differentiating between stenoses of more than or less than 50%. All of the occlusions were correctly identified. It is concluded that ultrasound Doppler examination is an accurate method for diagnoses of stenosis in the carotid artery.
