The Eligible study: ultrasound assessment in acute ischemic stroke within 3 hours. to identify with echo color Doppler ultrasound of the supra-aortic vessels and transcranial color-coded duplex sonography (TCCD) various patterns of vessel occlusion within 3 h from stroke onset, to compare each group defined at the admission with clinical findings and outcome, and to study the recanalization process, independent of therapy.We enrolled 89 consecutive patients (mean age 68.9 years). Ultrasound evaluation was done within 3 h from stroke onset, and was repeated at 3-6 and 24-36 h, at day 5, and at 3 months. At admission, patients were divided into the following groups: internal carotid artery occlusions and stenoses (<50%, 50-69%, > or =70%, near occlusion), middle cerebral artery stenoses and occlusions, tandem occlusions and T occlusions. Vascular recanalization in each group was evaluated. Subgroups were compared for NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the outcome measures mortality, Barthel index (BI) and modified Rankin scale (mRS). Favorable outcome was defined as mRS < or =2 and BI > or =90.Each subgroup differed significantly for baseline NIHSS (p < 0.0001), 3-month mortality (p = 0.0235), BI at day 5 (p = 0.0458) and mRS at 3 months (p = 0.0028), even after adjustment for treatment. T and tandem occlusions were the subgroups with the highest NIHSS scores and the poorest outcomes, and the same subgroups had the worst recanalization rates.TCCD in the acute setting of stroke patients allows identification of the presence and site of clots, prediction of outcome and study of the dynamic process of vessel recanalization, in both the acute phase and follow-up.
