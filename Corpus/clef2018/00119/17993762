Ankle brachial pressure index usefulness as predictor factor for coronary heart disease in diabetic patients. Ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) is a non-invasive marker of atherosclerosis, helpful to identify subjects at high-risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) among large populations with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The diagnostic role of ABPI has been also recognized in patients with diabetes. In the present study, the role of an ABPI score < 0.90 in predicting CHD has been evaluated in a large series of patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus and compared to other known CVD risk factors. Nine hundred and sixty-nine (mean age was 66.1 yr) consecutive patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus were evaluated. The patients were followed-up for 18.3+/-5.2 months (range 12- 24) and all events of CHD, defined as myocardial infarction, unstable and resting angina or coronary atherosclerosis at the instrumental investigation (at the coronary angiography and/or perfusion stress testing) were recorded. A rate of 17.5% of CHD events were recorded in diabetic population during the follow-up period. The relative risk of CHD was significantly increased for male patients [odds ratio (OR): 1.6 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1-2.2], patients with age > or = 66 yr (OR: 1.8
