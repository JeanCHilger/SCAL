The assessment of TIKLO efficacy in patients with intermittent claudication. The efficacy of TIKLO was compared with acetylsalicylic acid in treatment of patients with intermittent claudication. Patients were divided into 2 groups (30 and 33 subjects). The first group received TIKLO (250 mg, BID), the second one - Thrombo ASS (100 mg, QD). Outcome measures included platelet aggregation, walking distance and the time of ankle-brachial index (ABI) recovery after treadmill test. TIKLO was shown to reduce platelet aggregation, increase pain-free walking distance and decrease the time of ABI recovery after treadmill test. TIKLO administration was accompanied with minimal adverse events.
