Long-term outcomes of femoropopliteal bypass above the knee-joint fissure by means of vascular prosthesis <Ecoflon> in patients with atherosclerotic lesions of lower limb arteries. Presented herein are the remote results of a total of 110 operations of femoropopliteal shunting above the knee-joint fissure, carried out using the vascular: prosthesis <Ecoflon> in patients diagnosed with atherosclerotic lesions of arteries of the lower limbs over the period between November 1995 and December 2005 at the Department of Vascular Surgery of the A. V. Vishnevsky Institute of Surgery of the Russian Academy of: Medical Sciences. The operative interventions were carried out according to the conventionally accepted technique. Fifty-four (49.1%) patients were operated on for grade II B ischemia, 26 (23.6%) suffered from grade III ischaemia, and 30 (27,3%) subjects were found to have grade IV ischaemia. The average age of the patients was 60.2+/- 7.4 years. The mean values of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) along the posterior greater femoral artery (PGFA) and the anterior greater femoral artery (AGFA) in patients presenting with grade II B ischaemia amounted to 0.52+/-0.21 and 0.55+/-0.15, respectively. In patients with critical ischaemia, the respective ABI values equalled 0,37+/-0,23 and 0.4+/-0.22 Studying the state of the distal bed showed that the condition of the outflow tracts was <satisfactory> in 54.3% of patients, being defined as <good> in 37%, and as <poor> in 8,7%. The total duration of the long-term follow-up period amounted to: 100 months, averaging 28.4+/-19.5 months. The main clinical factors determining the remote: patency of the vascular prostheses <Ecoflon> in the femoropopliteal position were as follows the values of the outflow score, the diameter of the popliteal artery, and the ankle-brachial index after surgery. With <good> outflow tracts, the patency of the transplants after 3 years amounted to 57%., after 5 years being 48%. In cases of <satisfactory> outflow tracts, the patency of the vascular prostheses 3 years, after surgery amounted to 26%. In <poor> outflow tracts, none of the bypasses remained passable for more than 12 months (P<0.01). The dependence between the value of the lumen of the popliteal artery and the patency of the vascular prosthesis was observed to be persisting during the first 2 years following fiurnory, In patients with arterial lumen <3 mm, the patency after 6. 12 and 18 months amounted to 61%, 47% and 41%, respectively
