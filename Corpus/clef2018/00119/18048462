Ankle-brachial index and hemostatic markers in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study cohort. To determine whether elevated levels of hemostatic and inflammatory markers [von Willebrand factor (vWF), fibrinogen, D-dimer, factor VII, factor VIII, PAI-1, tPA, beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TG), CRP, and WBC count] are associated with increased peripheral arterial disease (PAD) prevalence, measured by low ABI, we studied 13,778 participants from the ARIC study in a cross-sectional analysis after adjustment for major cardiovascular risk factors. PAD was positively associated with fibrinogen, vWF, factor VIII, WBC count, D-dimer, beta-TG, and CRP (p for trend <0.05) but not with the other markers. Adjusted odds ratios for the highest versus the lowest quartile of fibrinogen in men and women, respectively, were 3.49 (95% CI 1.68-7.26) and 2.44 (95% CI 1.58-3.77) for vWF 2.36 (95% CI 1.36-4.07) and 1.45 (95% CI 1.00-2.10)
