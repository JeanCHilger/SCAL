Ghrelin, glucose homeostasis, and carotid intima media thickness in kidney transplantation. Abnormalities in glucose homeostasis (AGH) frequently occur in kidney transplantation and favor vascular lesions. The purpose of this study was to analyze whether C-reactive protein (CRP), adiponectin, and ghrelin are markers of AGH and indicators of carotid atherosclerosis in kidney transplant patients with fasting plasma glucose below 126 mg/dL.This was a cross-sectional study of 85 kidney transplant patients (59 men mean age: 52.4 +/- 11.6 yearsA total of 50.5% of patients had AGH (12.9% were diagnosed with new-onset diabetes mellitus after transplantation and 37.7% had impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose), whereas 49.4% were normoglycemic. Patients with AGH were older (P=0.002), had greater carotid IMT (P=0.022), and lower ghrelin concentrations (P=0.017) than normoglycemic patients. Logistic regression analyses showed ghrelin to be an independent marker for AGH (P=0.012) and AGH to be related to greater IMT (P=0.041). No differences in adiponectin or CRP were found in relation to AGH or atherosclerosis however, there was a positive correlation between adiponectin levels and prednisone dose (r=0.240A total of 50.5% of the study patients had abnormalities in glucose homeostasis. Patients with AGH had a higher percentage of preclinical atherosclerosis (greater carotid IMT). Ghrelin is an independent marker for abnormalities in glucose homeostasis.
