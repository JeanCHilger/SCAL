Diminished baroreflex-induced vasoconstriction following alpha-2 adrenergic receptor blockade in humans. The relative contribution of alpha adrenergic receptor subtypes in the transduction of sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) during carotid baroreflex (CBR) engagement is not well understood. Therefore, we compared the hemodynamic consequence of CBR-mediated sympatho-excitation via neck pressure (NP) before and after alpha-2 adrenergic blockade with intra-arterial yohimbine. Leg blood flow was measured using 2D and Doppler ultrasound, and arterial blood pressure was determined directly. NP caused the expected vasoconstriction, and this response was significantly reduced (by 50-60%) when NP was repeated after yohimbine. These data indicate that alpha-2 adrenergic receptors contribute significantly to CBR-induced vasoconstriction in the human leg under resting conditions.
