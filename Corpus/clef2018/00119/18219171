Availability of cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) as a screening tool for atherosclerosis. A novel index, the cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI), which reflects the stiffness of the aorta, femoral artery, and tibial artery, was recently developed by measuring brachial - ankle pulse wave velocity and blood pressure.In the present study 1,014 Japanese adults from the general population were screened to clarify the correlation between CAVI and other existing markers related to atherosclerosis, including carotid intima - media thickness (CIMT) and homocysteine (HCY). CAVI was strongly associated with age in both men and women. After adjustment for age and sex, CAVI was correlated with systolic and diastolic blood pressures. In addition, CAVI was significantly correlated with total cholesterol hemoglobin A(1c) and total HCY, as well as CIMT.CAVI is an appropriate screening tool for atherosclerosis, but further studies are needed to establish a convenient and effective screening system using it.
