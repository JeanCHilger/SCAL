Significant correlation of glycated albumin, but not glycated haemoglobin, with arterial stiffening in haemodialysis patients with type 2 diabetes. We recently reported that glycated albumin (GA) is a better indicator of glycaemic control compared with glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in haemodialysis (HD) patients with type 2 diabetes. As poor glycaemic control is considered an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis in diabetes, the relationship between GA, HbA1c and arterial stiffening was examined in HD patients with type 2 diabetes.The present study comprised 134 HD patients with type 2 diabetes, and 158 patients without diabetes. Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) was measured in all patients using a waveform analyser.The mean plasma glucose (PG), GA and HbA1c levels were 7.49 +/- 2.28 mmol/l, 20.8 +/- 5.57% and 5.62 +/- 1.26%, respectively, in HD patients with diabetes (n = 134), which were significantly greater than the respective values of 5.77 +/- 1.89 mmol/l, 15.6 +/- 2.34% and 4.98 +/- 0.80% in those without diabetes (n = 158) (P < 0.0001). BaPWV was 21.69 +/- 6.90 m/s in HD patients with diabetes, which was significantly greater than the value of 18.74 +/- 4.89 m/s in those without diabetes (P < 0.0001). When the analysis was performed in a combined population of those patients with and without diabetes, the mean PG (r = 0.155, P < 0.05) and GA (r = 0.117, P < 0.05), but not HbA1c (r = 0.092, P = 0.125), exhibited significant correlations with baPWV. Multivariate regression analysis, which included age, gender, mean blood pressure, and serum levels of albumin, creatinine and LDL cholesterol, to evaluate the independent association of each marker for glycaemic control with baPWV values in HD patients demonstrated that GA, but not HbA1c or PG, was an independent factor that was significantly associated in a positive manner with baPWV in HD patients.It was suggested that poor glycaemic control, as reflected by increased GA values, might be associated with increased arterial stiffening in HD patients.
