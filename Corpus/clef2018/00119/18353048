Is Helicobacter pylori related to endothelial dysfunction during childhood? Helicobacter pylori infection has been proposed to have a role in the development of atherosclerosis preceded by endothelial dysfunction. The aim of the present study was to determine if a relationship exists between H. pylori infection in childhood and endothelial dysfunction and level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP).Between October 2003 and November 2004, 28 subjects who were anti-H. pylori IgG-positive and 25 who were anti-H. pylori IgG-negative were included in the study. Mean ages of the H. pylori-positive and negative groups were not significantly different. Endothelial functions were evaluated on Doppler ultrasonography of the brachial artery. Percent ratio of the change in systolic diameter during hyperemic phase to the basal diameter was evaluated. Each subject's serum was tested for hsCRP, homocysteine and lipids.Percent ratio of the change in systolic diameters during hyperemic phase to the basal diameter was not significantly different between the H. pylori-negative and -positive groups (P > 0.29). Mean levels of hsCRP were also not significantly different (1.48 +/- 1.8 g/dL vs 2.35 +/- 3.33 g/dL P > 0.24). Similarly, serum levels of lipids and homocysteine were not significantly different (P > 0.05 for all lipids).Non-invasive techniques used in the present study were not indicative of early findings of atherosclerosis in H. pylori infection during childhood. Further studies are required to evaluate the relationship between early endothelial dysfunction and H. pylori infection in children with cardiovascular risk factors.
