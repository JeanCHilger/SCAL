Predictors for peripheral and carotid revascularization in a population-based cohort with type 2 diabetes. The study was aimed to define the predictors for peripheral and carotid revascularization in type 2 diabetic population. In all, 279 patients with type 2 diabetes and peripheral arterial disease were enrolled in a cohort longitudinal study. Study population was followed up for 24 months for the need and performance of peripheral or carotid revascularization. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify variables predictive of revascularization, when lipid plasma levels, glycemia, arterial hypertension, blood pressures, ankle-brachial index, intima-media thickness, body mass index, waist circumference, and hip distances were put in a model. Total cholesterol and maximal value of carotid intima-media thickness were presented as factors that independently influenced the performed peripheral revascularization. Waist circumference is defined as independent factor associated with carotid endarterectomy. Measurement of carotid intima-media thickness, waist circumference, and plasma lipid levels in type 2 diabetes with manifested peripheral and carotid arterial disease should be recommended in a manner of proper risk stratification of this population.
