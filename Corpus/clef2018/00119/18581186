Self-reported peripheral arterial disease predicts future vascular events in a community-based cohort. Lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is highly prevalent and strongly associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The ankle-brachial index used to screen for PAD is not routinely performed in primary care settings.To determine if self-reported PAD is an independent predictor of combined vascular events (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and vascular death).Ongoing population-based prospective cohort (the Northern Manhattan Study). Subjects enrolled between July 1993 and June 2001 with a mean follow-up time of 7.1 years.Subjects (n = 2,977), aged 40 years or older and free of prior stroke or myocardial infarction, were classified as having self-reported PAD if they answered affirmatively to one of two questions regarding exercise-induced leg pain or a prior diagnosis of PAD.Combined vascular outcome defined as incident myocardial infarction, incident ischemic stroke, or vascular death.The mean age of the cohort was 68.9 +/- 10.4 years 64% were womenSelf-reported PAD is an independent risk factor for future vascular events in this predominantly non-white cohort. The addition of two simple PAD questions to the routine medical history in general medicine settings could identify high-risk patients who would benefit from further vascular evaluation and risk factor modification.
