Doppler ultrasonic diagnosis for arterial occlusive disease in the lower limbs. Measurement of segmental arterial pressure by Doppler ultrasonography and Doppler arterial tracing in the lower extremity has become a widely used noninvasive diagnostic technique for arterial occlusive diseases. One hundred and twelve limbs with arterial occlusive disease (aortoiliac 45, superficial femoral 13, popliteal 11, aorto-iliac-femoro-popliteal 35, and tibiofibular arterial segments 8) were evaluated by both angiographic and Doppler ultrasonic techniques, Angiographic findings showed that ultrasonic diagnosis was accurate in 86% of aorto-iliac-femoro-popliteal arterial lesions, in 92% of superficial femoral arterial lesions, and in 100% of the remaining lesions. We believe that the diagnostic accuracy of Doppler ultrasonography could be further improved with the help of segmental arterial pressure measurement using 4 separated narrow cuffs and blood stream tracing technique.
