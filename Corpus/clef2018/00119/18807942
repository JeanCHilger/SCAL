Excimer laser angioplasty for subclavian artery stenosis--case report. Endovascular angioplasty for subclavian artery stenosis is effective and less invasive than other methods however, it is difficult to advance guidewires or balloon catheters through severely stenotic lesions. We report a case of subclavian artery stenosis treated with excimer laser angioplasty. A 58-year-old man with hypertension and hyperlipidemia was admitted to a hospital with different blood pressure in each arm. A CT scan revealed left subclavian artery stenosis, and the patient was transferred to our hospital. An angiogram revealed a severely stenotic lesion in his left subclavian artery, representing subclavian steal phenomenon. Endovascular angioplasty was performed under local anesthesia with embolic protection for the left vertebral artery. The guidewire successfully crossed the lesion, and stepwise balloon angioplasty was performed using increasing balloon sizes from 1.5 to 2.0 mm
