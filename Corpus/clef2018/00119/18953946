Relationship between pulse wave velocity and the NYha classification of coronary insufficiency. To investigate the relationship between brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) and different stage of cardiac dysfunction.253 consecutive patients with coronary atherosclerotic heart disease were enrolled from August 2006 to February 2007. Patients were grouped according to the functional classification of New York Heart Association (NYHA). The baPWV was measured non-invasively with a VP1000 automated PWV/ABI analyzer (PWV/ABI, Colin CO. Ltd., Komaki, Japan). At the same time, BNP, EF, LAEDV and LVESV were measured in all the patients.Brachial-ankle PWV was significantly correlated with cardiac function classification of NYHA (r = 0. 444, P < 0.001), BNP( r = 0.394, < 0.001) and left ventricular end diastolic volume (r = - 0.130, P < 0.05). The under area of receiver operating charachateistic (ROC) curve was 73.9%. The ROC curve demonstrated that when the value of brachial-ankle PWV was equal to or larger than 1717 cm/s (> 1717 cm/s), the sensitivity of diagnosing mild cardiac dysfunction was 72.9% and specifity 61.8%. When its value was equal to or larger than 1900 cm/s (> or = 1900 cm/s), the sensitivity and specificity were 61.5% and 81.9% respectively.Brachial-ankle PWV is significantly correlated to the NYHA classification of heart failure and it may be a prospective index to diagnose early stage of cardiac dysfunction.
