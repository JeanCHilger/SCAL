The association between ankle brachial pressure index and pulse wave velocity: clinical implication of pulse wave velocity. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between ankle brachial pressure index and pulse wave velocity in patients with peripheral arterial disease.Brachial-knee and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity were measured by pneumoplethysmography using cuffs in a standard technique. Correlation between pulse wave velocity and Doppler-ankle brachial pressure index was assessed by Spearman correlation and receiver operating curves.A total of 133 claudicants were assessed. Analysis by developing receiver operating curves for ankle brachial pressure index and pulse wave velocity showed that patients with ankle brachial pressure index over 0.6 were more likely to have a bk-pulse wave velocity over 9.2 m/s and ba-pulse wave velocity over 9.5 m/s.These results show for the first time that nondiabetic vascular patients may have measurable significant arterial stiffness independent of an impaired ankle brachial pressure index. These data suggest that pulse wave velocity may be valuable in screening and evaluating the severity of peripheral arterial disease.
