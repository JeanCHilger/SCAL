Monitoring vascular complications following liver transplantation using color Doppler flow imaging. To assess the value of color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) in monitoring vascular complications following orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT).Seven hundred ninety-two patients who received OLT from April 2002 to December 2006 in the Organ Transplantation Center, General Hospital of Chinese People's Armed Police Forces, Beijing, and underwent CDFI examinations in different periods after OLT were enrolled in this study. Their vascular complications were monitored by CDFI and confirmed by angiography or spiral CT.Of the 792 patients, 54 were diagnosed with vascular complications that occurred 1-360 days after their OLT operations. These complications occurred within 1-30 days, 31-60 days, 61-90 days, 91-180 days, 181-360 days, with the proportions of 46.30%, 22.22%, 14.81%, 9.26% and 7.41% respectively. The proportion of hepatic artery and portal vein complications and outflow occlusions were 61.11%, 35.19% and 3.70% respectively.Most vascular complications occurred within six months after the OLT operation. The continuous and careful monitoring by CDFI is beneficial in an early diagnosis of vascular complications after OLT.
