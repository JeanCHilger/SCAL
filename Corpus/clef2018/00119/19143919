Treatment of penile deep dorsal venous leakage of erectile dysfunction by embedding the deep dorsal vein of the penis: a single center experience with 17 patients. The common surgery for venous leakage was not very successful unsatisfactory long-term results have reduced the indications for venous surgery for erectile dysfunction (ED).To assess the outcomes of embedding the deep dorsal vein of the penis (EDDVP), a new surgical technique used in patients with penile deep dorsal venous leakage of ED.Between December 2001 and November 2007, 17 patients diagnosed with penile deep dorsal venous leakage of ED underwent embedding the deep dorsal vein of the penis.All cases were available for follow up by using the abridged 5-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) scoring system and penile color Doppler ultrasound. Dynamic cavernosography were also assessed in three patients at 3 months postoperatively.After surgery, 14 patients were able to achieve satisfactory intercourse and three had sufficient erection after oral sildenafil (50-100 mg). The IIEF-5 scoring changed from a preoperative mean IIEF-5 score of 8.8 +/- 3.9 to 20.8 +/- 4.1 (P < 0.05). Peak systolic velocity (average of right and left cavernosal arteries) changed from 41.9 +/- 7.7 cm/second to 44.2 +/- 9.2 cm/second (P > 0.05), resistance index changed from 0.79 +/- 0.1 to 1.00 +/- 0.0 (P < 0.05), and venous velocity changed from 8.4 +/- 4.0 cm/second to 0.0 +/- 0.0 cm/second (P < 0.05). Dynamic cavernosography demonstrated a smooth flow of the deep dorsal vein during the flaccid phase. During the tumescent phase, the deep dorsal vein of the penis was compressed between the dilated sinusoidal spaces and the tunica albuginea and resulted in venous drainage blockade. And then the hardness of erection was improved and maintained.The new surgical technique of EDDVP is a simple operative procedure, which seems to be efficient in the treatment of penile deep dorsal venous leakage of ED.
