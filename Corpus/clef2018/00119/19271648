Medical therapy in peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is often asymptomatic. If symptomatic, patients present intermittent claudication, ischemic rest pain or tissue necrosis. The prevalence of PAD increases with age and affects about 2% of patients at 60 years. Patients with PAD have an increased risk of coronary or cerebro-vascular events. Measure of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) allows early detection of asymptomatic patients, and allows early preventive interventions, in order to reduce their cardio-vascular risk. The most important interventions are smoking cessation, normalisation of blood pressure and lipid levels, and introduction of an antiplatelet agent, such as aspirin 75 to 160 mg/d.
