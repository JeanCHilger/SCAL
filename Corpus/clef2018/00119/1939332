Perioperative arterial monitoring in patients with severe occlusive disease. Special problems exist in the study and intraoperative monitoring of patients with severe occlusive vascular disease involving all extremities and with symptomatic brachiocephalic or coronary artery disease. We report 3 such patients who underwent arteriography via a percutaneous translumbar aortic catheter. All patients then underwent successful arterial reconstructive procedures utilizing the same translumbar catheter for arterial pressure monitoring and blood gas analysis. Percutaneous translumbar aortic catheters provide both a safe method for studying patients with four extremity occlusive vascular disease and reliable arterial access to monitor these patients intraoperatively.
