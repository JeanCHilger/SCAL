Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. All surgical patients are at risk for the development of deep venous thrombosis and subsequent pulmonary embolism or postphlebitic syndrome. The evolution of ultrasonographic imaging has increased the awareness of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of deep venous thrombosis. Duplex imaging and Doppler color flow imaging have made the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis relatively simple, painless, inexpensive, and definitive. These procedures have gained acceptance by both patients and physicians. Several risk factors have been identified that increase the chance of the development of deep venous thrombosis. These factors include a history of deep venous thrombosis, presence of a malignant process, increasing age, cigarette smoking, obesity, prolonged bed rest, and general anesthesia. The greater the number of risk factors, the more aggressive prophylaxis should be. Means of prophylaxis have improved, and surgeons now generally agree that some form of prophylaxis is required. Heparin and intermittent compression devices appear to be equally effective in preventing deep venous thrombosis. The addition of venous monitoring in high-risk patients permits immediate identification of the presence of deep venous thrombosis. During the last decade, the treatment of patients with deep venous thrombosis has changed little. Heparin followed by warfarin remains the treatment of choice. A small group of patients receive fibrinolytic therapy for deep venous thrombosis. Although the incidence of postoperative deep venous thrombosis has decreased during the last decade, it remains a significant complication.
