Stent implantation in chronic mesenteric ischemia. Chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) is a life-threatening disorder, which is usually associated with stenosis or occlusion of celiac or mesenteric arteries.To review our experience and to assess short-term results of stent placement in stenotic mesenteric arteries.Primary stent placement was performed in 15 patients who had nausea, vomiting, postprandial pain, and weight loss due to steno-occlusive diseases of mesenteric arteries. After stenting, the patients were followed clinically and with Doppler ultrasound at 1, 6, and 12 months. Symptomatic patients with restenosis were examined with digital subtraction angiography and were referred for retreatment with balloon dilatation.Twenty-three stenoses and 11 occlusions were detected in 15 patients, and 18 stenoses were treated with primary stenting. Single-vessel endovascular treatment was performed in 12 patients. In three patients, two arteries were stented in the same session. Technical success rate was 18/18 (100%). Clinical success was achieved in 13/15 (86.6%) patients. First-month mortality was 13%. During the mean 16.1-month follow-up period, restenoses developed in three patients. One of them was successfully treated with balloon angioplasty. Primary patency was 9/11 (81%) and primary assisted patency was 81% at 12 months. The complication rate was 1/15 patients (0.06%).Our experience suggests that stent placement has a potential role in chronic mesenteric ischemia with low incidence of complications and high technical and clinical success rates.
