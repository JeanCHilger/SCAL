Stent-graft placement for management of iatrogenic hepatic artery branch pseudoaneurysm after liver transplantation. Pseudoaneurysm of the hepatic arteries is uncommon following liver transplantation and is usually iatrogenic. We describe a case of balloon angioplasty of a left hepatic artery stenosis complicated by an iatrogenic pseudoaneurysm. Resolution of the stenosis and the pseudoaneurysm was achieved through a combination of a bare stent and a balloon-expandable covered stent. The completion angiogram demonstrated excellent appearance of the patent hepatic arteries with exclusion of the pseudoaneurysm. No surgery was required. The graft and the patient did well for the following 6 months. Doppler ultrasound examination at 2 and 6 months postintervention revealed patent hepatic arteries and no evidence of the pseudoaneurysm.
