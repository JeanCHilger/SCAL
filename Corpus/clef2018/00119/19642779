Five-year Irish trial of CLI patients with TASC II type C/D lesions undergoing subintimal angioplasty or bypass surgery based on plaque echolucency. To report a 5-year observational parallel group study comparing the effectiveness of subintimal angioplasty (SIA) to bypass grafting (BG) for treatment of TASC II type C/D lesions in the lower limb arteries of patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI).Of 1076 patients referred with PVD from 2002 to 2007, 206 SIAs in 190 patients (104 women mean age 73+/-13 years) and 128 bypass grafts in 119 patients (77 menAt 5 years, clinical improvement was sustained in 82.8% of the SIA group versus 68.2% of the BG patients (p = 0.106). Five-year all-cause survival was similar for SIA (78.6%) and BG (80.1% p = 0.734), as was amputation-free survival (SIA 72.9% versus BG 71.2%Five-year freedom from MAE was enhanced by 20% in the SIA group, with substantial cost reduction and better Q-TWiST. SIA is a minimally invasive technique that expands amputation-free and symptom-free survival. SIA is poised to bring about a paradigm shift in the management of CLI.
