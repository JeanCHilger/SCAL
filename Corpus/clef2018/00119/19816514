Association of intraocular pressure with the metabolic syndrome and novel cardiometabolic risk factors. This study aimed to investigate the association of intraocular pressure (IOP) with the metabolic syndrome and other emerging cardiometabolic risk factors.A total of 1112 participants undergoing a health check-up in a community hospital were recruited. All participants underwent ophthalmological examination including IOP measurement.Participants with metabolic syndrome had significantly higher IOP than those without metabolic syndrome (mean IOP+/-SD: 15.07+/-2.74 vs 14.29+/-2.72 mm Hg, P=2x10(-4)). Each additional component of the metabolic syndrome was associated with a mean increase in IOP of 0.33 mm Hg (95% confidence interval: 0.18-0.48, trend P<0.0001). Other insulin resistance-related features, including hepatic steatosis, increased left ventricular mass, and proteinuria, were also associated with IOP (P<0.0001, 0.002, and 0.01, respectively). However, we did not find significant association of plasma apolipoprotein A, apolipoprotein B1, homocysteine, or highly sensitive C-reactive protein levels with IOP. IOP was also not associated with measures of subclinical atherosclerosis including brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity, ankle-brachial index, and vertebral artery flow.Metabolic syndrome and other insulin resistance-related features, including hepatic steatosis, increased left ventricular mass, and proteinuria, are strongly associated with IOP.
