Coil embolization of patent ductus arteriosus via the carotid artery in seven dogs. This study was designed to evaluate the feasibility and limitations of transcatheter embolization coil occlusion of patent ductus arteriosus in dogs using a carotid artery approach. Seven dogs examined at the University of California, Davis Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital in 2002-2003 for evaluation of heart disease had congenital patent ductus arteriosus diagnosed by characteristic physical, electrocardiographic, radiographic, and anatomic and Doppler echocardiographic findings. Dogs were anesthetized for transesophageal echocardiography and transcatheter coil embolization of the ductus via the right external carotid artery. Coil embolization was achieved in all seven cases, using one to four detachable embolization coils. There were no major complications. Minor complications occurred in two dogs (additional coils placed using a femoral arterial approach and coil embolization of a left femoral artery branch). One dog was examined only 24 h post-operatively and had no murmur and trivial residual ductal flow by Doppler echocardiography. The other 6 dogs were clinically healthy when examined up to three years post-intervention. One dog had a very soft continuous murmur and mild residual ductal flow the other five had no audible continuous murmur, with only one dog having trivial residual ductal flow identified by Doppler echocardiography. Although technically challenging, coil embolization via the carotid artery is a viable alternative approach for transcatheter closure of patent ductus arteriosus in some dogs.
