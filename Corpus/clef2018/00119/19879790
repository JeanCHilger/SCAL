Early-stage atherosclerosis in newly diagnosed, untreated type 2 diabetes mellitus and impaired glucose tolerance. The aim of this study was to investigate early-stage atherosclerosis in newly diagnosed, untreated type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).The study subjects underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and were then divided into three groups, according to plasma glucose level: those in the normal glucose tolerance (NGT) group had fasting plasma glucose (FPG)<6.1mmol/L and 2h postload glucose (2hPPG)<7.8mmol/L those in the IGT group had FPG<6.1mmol/L and 2hPPG>or=7.8mmol/LThe baPWV value increased with increases in plasma glucose, and was significantly and positively correlated to age, FPG, 2hPPG, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio. Significant differences were found between the baPWV values in the NGT and IGT groups (1602+/-347 vs 1707+/-351cm/s, respectively P=0.005), and between the NGT and DM groups (1602+/-347 vs 1762+/-381, respectivelyEarly-stage atherosclerosis is present in newly diagnosed, untreated T2DM and IGT patients, and it may be that its early assessment, along with good control of hypertension and hyperglycaemia, will help to delay its progression.
