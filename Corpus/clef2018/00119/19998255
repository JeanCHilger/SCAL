Long-term outcome of patients with mild intermittent claudication under secondary prevention. The known natural history of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is determined by the generalization of atherosclerosis with resulting high cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality. The aim of this prospective study was to record all vascular and non-vascular events in patients with mild intermittent claudication (IC) undergoing secondary preventive measures in a 10-year follow-up and to determine the time-points at which systemic localizations of atherosclerotic events develop.Patients who originally had an isolated Fontaine stage IIa PAD were included in the follow-up which involved assessments carried out on an annual basis. The incidence and timepoints of vascular (i.e., myocardial infarction, stroke, critical limb ischemia, vascular death), and nonvascular events (i.e., cancer, non vascular death) were recorded and compared with the known natural history.534 events (vascular: 433) concerning 109 claudicants (M/F: 88/21 60.8 +/- 8.8 yearsA high vascular comorbidity also develops under secondary prevention as an expression of the continuing generalization of the atherosclerotic process in PAD. The causes for death are determined both by the vascular and the tumor related comorbidity.
