What factors accelerate aortic stiffening in hemodialysis patients? An observational study. Increased aortic stiffness is an independent predictor of death from cardiovascular disease in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Various factors that contribute to carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) as a surrogate of aortic stiffness have been identified, but determinants of long-term worsening of aortic stiffness remain to be elucidated. To clarify the factors that accelerate aortic stiffness in hemodialysis patients, 148 patients with ESRD on hemodialysis were evaluated. At baseline, cfPWV and ankle-brachial blood pressure index (ABPI) were measured and clinical status including biochemical parameters, with or without hepatitis c virus (HCV) infection, diabetes mellitus (DM), cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease and peripheral arterial disease at baseline, were evaluated. The cfPWV was measured again after a 3-year follow up and the annual change in cfPWV was calculated. The cfPWV decreased in 54 patients, worsened slowly in 47 (annual change in cfPWV ranged from 0 to 0.33 ms(-1) per year), and worsened rapidly in 47 patients (annual change in cfPWV was more than 0.33 ms(-1) per year). The prevalences of DM, HCV infection and peripheral arterial disease were the highest in the rapid progression group. Univariate analysis showed that age, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), LDL-C/HDL-C ratio, HCV infection, ABPI and number of vasculopathies were significantly associated with annual change in cfPWV. Stepwise regression analysis identified ABPI, LDL-C/HDL-C ratio and HCV infection as independent determinants of worsening of cfPWV. Further studies are needed to investigate the mechanism of HCV-related enhancement of aortic stiffness in ESRD patients.
