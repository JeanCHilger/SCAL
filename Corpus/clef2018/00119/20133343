Ankle-brachial index performance among internal medicine residents. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) is the standard test used in clinical practice to detect peripheral artery disease (PAD) and is a powerful predictor of adverse cardiovascular outcomes. This study sought to measure the baseline knowledge of the ABI test among a sample of internal medicine residents and to examine the impact of an educational intervention on performance of the test. A total of 29 residents were asked to perform three tasks, with the performance of each task being assessed using a point-based scoring system: measure an ABI on a normal volunteer (15 points), calculate the ABI based on data from a hypothetical patient (3 points), and interpret a range of ABI values (6 points). A standardized educational intervention was then provided and post-education performance was assessed for each task using the same scoring system. At baseline, 4% of residents correctly measured the ABI, 10% correctly calculated the ABI, and 45% correctly interpreted the ABI. Baseline performance was unaffected by year of residency training. Following the educational intervention, 50% of residents correctly measured the ABI, 75% correctly calculated the ABI, and 88% correctly interpreted the ABI. The mean score for the tasks of ABI measurement, calculation and interpretation between baseline and post-education were 4.6 +/- 3 and 13.9 +/- 1.6 (p < 0.0001), 1 +/- 0.9 and 2.3 +/- 1.2 (p = 0.002), and 4.9 +/- 1.6 and 5.9 +/- 0.3 (p = 0.008), respectively. In conclusion, baseline knowledge of the ABI test was poor among a sample of internal medicine residents. These results suggest that instruction regarding the ABI test is deficient in medical school and residency programs and requires action by those responsible for the education of medical students and residents.
