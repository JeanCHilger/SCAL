Three-year cardiovascular events and disease progress in patients with peripheral arterial disease: results from the Japan Medication Therapy for Peripheral Arterial Disease (J-METHOD). To investigate the current status of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) drug treatment in Japan, and the effects of drug treatment, risk factors, and complications on disease progress and onset of cardiovascular events in PAD patients.In this prospective observational cohort study, 557 PAD patients were followed up for 3 years, and the current status of PAD treatment, risk factors, and cardiovascular events were monitored.Three drugs, i.e., beraprost sodium, cilostazol, and aspirin, were most frequently used. The patients who had undergone vascular reconstruction of the lower limbs before enrollment showed significant improvement in ABI. Among the patients who had not undergone vascular reconstruction before enrollment, there was a significant improvement in ABI after treatment with beraprost. During the observation period, cardiovascular deaths occurred in 35 patients (6.3%), heart diseases in 63 (11.3%), brain diseases in 39 (7.0%), and events in the lower limbs in 94 (16.9%). The factors affecting the increase of the cardiovascular events were explored by multivariate analysis (Cox regression analysis). As a result, age (75 years or older), ischemic heart disease and increase in severity on the Fontaine classification were identified as significant factors for cardiovascular deaths, whereas kidney disorders and increase in severity on the Fontaine classification were identified for heart diseases, the number of oral drugs for treating PAD was identified for brain diseases, and age (younger than 75 years), dialysis, ABI (less than 0.7) and aspirin were identified for the events in the lower limbs.As a result of the three-year follow-up on the Japanese PAD cohort, the current status of PAD treatment, risk factors, and cardiovascular events could be identified.
