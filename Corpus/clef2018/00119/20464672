Infrapopliteal run-off and the outcome of femoropopliteal percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. The outcome of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of peripheral arterial lesions is influenced by several factors, including the haemodynamic conditions. Our study tested: (a) whether infrapopliteal run-off after completed PTA influenced the time course of restenosis/reocclusion of the femoropopliteal arterial segment, and (b) whether worsening of infrapopliteal run-off influenced the long-term femoropopliteal patency after PTA.Among 245 patients treated by femoropopliteal PTA we enrolled 176 patients who consented to regular follow-up. Concomitant infrapopliteal PTA was performed whenever feasible. The technical success of PTA and the patency of calf arteries were assessed by angiography. Infrapopliteal run-off was scored by a modification of the Society for Vascular Surgery criteria. The treated patients' limbs were divided into a group with good infrapopliteal run-off and a group with compromised run-off. Follow-up examination of the femoropopliteal arterial segment was performed by vascular ultrasonography (US) 1, 6 and 12 months after PTA, and an adverse outcome was defined by a > or = 50 % stenosis, i.e., at least doubling of the maximal systolic velocity, or occlusion - evidenced by the absence of flow. The patency of calf arteries was re-assessed by US 12 months after PTA.One month after femoropopliteal PTA 19 / 83 (23 %) of patients with compromised run-off developed the combined end-point of restenosis or reocclusion in comparison to 10 / 93 (11 %) with good run-off (p = 0.03). After 6 months the incidence of restenosis/reocclusion had increased in both groups at an approximately equal rate, but the differences were no longer significant: 39 / 80 (49 %) in the compromised run-off group vs. 36 / 83 (43 %) in the good run-off group after 6 months, p = 0.49, and 42 / 73 (57 %) vs. 38 / 73 (52 %) after 12 months, p = 0.51. However, in patients' limbs with good periprocedural run-off that deteriorated into compromised run-off in the year after PTA, femoropopliteal restenosis/reocclusion occurred more often than in limbs which retained good run-off: 10 / 14 (71 %) vs. 18 / 51 (35 %), p = 0.02.Compromised postprocedural infrapopliteal run-off predisposes to early restenosis/reocclusion after femoropopliteal PTA. Deterioration of infrapopliteal run-off in the year after femoropopliteal PTA is accompanied by worsening of long-term femoropopliteal patency.
