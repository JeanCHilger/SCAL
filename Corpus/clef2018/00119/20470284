Combined assessment of chronic kidney disease and subclinical peripheral artery disease used to predict future cardiac events. Both the presence of peripheral arterial disease and chronic kidney disease has been reported to be independent risk factors associating with poor prognosis. However, the impact of combination of peripheral arterial disease and chronic kidney disease remains unknown.The long-term outcome in 715 consecutive patients who had undergone coronary angiogram for the evaluation of chest pain was analyzed. Patients on haemodialysis were excluded from this analysis. Cohort patients were divided into four groups according to the Ankle Brachial Index (ABI <0.9) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR <60 mL/min per m(2)): group A (n= 498 ABI >0.9, GFR >60)The mean follow-up period was 620 +/- 270 days. Total long-term event was present in 89 patients (groups A-D were 9.4%, 18.5%, 15.2% and 28.3%, respectively). Long-term event rate was 28.3% for patients with the presence of peripheral arterial disease and chronic kidney disease, compared to 9.4% for those without peripheral arterial disease and chronic kidney disease (P < 0.0001). Kaplan-Meier event-free survival curves also showed that the combination of peripheral arterial disease and chronic kidney disease predicted long-term event rate.The combination of chronic kidney disease and ABI of less than 0.9 undergoing coronary angiogram is strongly associated with long-term event rate.
