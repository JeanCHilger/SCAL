Lanarkshire Oximetry Index as a diagnostic tool for peripheral arterial disease in type 2 diabetes: a pilot study. We evaluated the Lanarkshire Oximetry Index (LOI) for the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in type 2 diabetic patients, using the Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) as gold standard. We included 161 patients (71 men, mean age 63.1 +/- 9.8 years). Peripheral arterial disease was defined as ABI < 0.9. Two cut-off values of LOI (<0.9 and <0.8) were assessed for the diagnosis of PAD. Sensitivity and specificity for PAD were 93.3% and 89.1%, respectively, using a LOI cut-off value of 0.9, while they were 40% and 99.3%, respectively, using a LOI cut-off value of 0.8. Agreement between LOI and ABI was moderate (P < .001). There was a significant positive correlation between ABI and LOI (r = .377, P < .001). Lanarkshire Oximetry Index is a potentially useful alternative diagnostic test for PAD in type 2 diabetes. A cut-off value of 0.9 has high sensitivity and modest specificity. Agreement between LOI and ABI is moderate.
