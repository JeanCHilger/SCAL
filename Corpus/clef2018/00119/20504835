Shorter telomere length is associated with greater decrease in ankle-brachial index in elderly Chinese women but not men. Telomere shortening has been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis directly or through influencing cardiovascular risk factors. We examined telomere length (TL) and change in ankle-brachial index (ABI) over 5 years in a Chinese population aged 65 years and older living in the community. Telomere length was determined using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method in 976 men and 1030 women. Ankle-brachial index was measured using Doppler ultrasound. Analysis of covariance was used to examine the relationship between quartiles of TL and baseline ABI values as well as percentage change in ABI, adjusting for confounders. Women had longer TL and lower ABI values compared with men, and there was a significant trend for an inverse association between TL and percentage decline in ABI after adjustment for confounders. No significant association was observed in men. The findings support the association between TL and markers of atherosclerosis in older women but not men.
