Association of serum lycopene and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity with metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is known to inversely correlate with antioxidant status. Recently, it has been reported that MetS is associated with arterial stiffness, a composite risk factor for early atherosclerosis. In addition, our recent study for healthy women showed an inverse relationship between arterial stiffness and circulating lycopene. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the interrelationship between arterial stiffness, antioxidant status, and the risk of MetS. Korean men (N = 299) were subgrouped according to the number of MetS risk factors (RF 0, RF 1-2, RF ≥ 3). Anthropometric parameters, brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV a marker of arterial stiffness), antioxidants (lycopene, β-carotene, α-tocopherol), lipid profiles, glucose, insulin, and oxidative stress (low-density lipoprotein [LDL] particle size, oxidized LDL) were measured. Corresponding to the number of MetS RF, baPWV (1306 ± 17, 1364 ± 16, and 1420 ± 33 cm/s
