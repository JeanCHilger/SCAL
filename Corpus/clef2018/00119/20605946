Exercise training improves muscle vasodilatation in individuals with T786C polymorphism of endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene. Allele T at promoter region of the eNOS gene has been associated with an increase in coronary disease mortality, suggesting that this allele increases susceptibility for endothelial dysfunction. In contrast, exercise training improves endothelial function. Thus, we hypothesized that: 1) Muscle vasodilatation during exercise is attenuated in individuals homozygous for allele T, and 2) Exercise training improves muscle vasodilatation in response to exercise for TT genotype individuals. From 133 preselected healthy individuals genotyped for the T786C polymorphism, 72 participated in the study: TT (n = 37 age 27 Â± 1 yr) and CT+CC (n = 35
