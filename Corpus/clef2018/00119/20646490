Surgical treatment for popliteal artery occlusive disease. To investigate surgical procedures for popliteal artery occlusive disease.The clinical data of 25 patients with popliteal artery occlusive disease from June 2007 to June 2008 was analyzed retrospectively. There were 18 male and 7 female with an average age of (53 ± 21) years. Eleven patients (11 limbs, 42.3%) were acute limb ischemia and 14 patients (15 limbs, 57.7%) were chronic limb ischemia. All patients were treated with surgical revascularization. Four limbs underwent thrombectomy. Nineteen limbs underwent endarterectomy with patch below knee. Three limbs underwent femoral-popliteal bypass with reversed saphenous vein or graft. Six of all the limbs underwent resection of the aberrant muscle when revascularization.Ischemic symptoms and claudication distance were improved in 24 patients (25 limbs). Postoperative ankle-branch index (ABI) was 0.75 ± 0.29, significantly higher than preoperative ABI 0.35 ± 0.20 (P < 0.01). Average follow up time was 10.2 months. I stage patency rate was 92.3%. Three patients were amputated postoperatively. The rate of limb salvage was 88.5% in this study.The cause of popliteal artery occlusive disease are diverse. Treatment for popliteal artery occlusive disease should depend on its etiology to make the outcomes be satisfied.
