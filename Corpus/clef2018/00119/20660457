Stenosis of alternative umbilical venous pathways in absence of the ductus venosus. We evaluated fetuses with absence of the ductus venosus (ADV) and restricted alternative umbilical venous pathways.We identified 3 cases that fit our objective. The angles of insonation for spectral Doppler ultrasound interrogation were less than 20 degrees in all cases. We used commercially available ultrasound systems with a curved array transducer.In all 3 cases, we noted mild cardiac volume overload without fetal hydrops.We speculate that the fetus with ADV and a restrictive alternative umbilical venous pathway may have a more benign clinical course than fetuses previously reported with unrestricted alternative pathways.
