Imaging of non-neoplastic intratesticular masses. The use of high-frequency ultrasound is increasing for the treatment of cystic, vascular, and solid non-neoplastic intratesticular masses. Cystic lesions examined include simple testicular cysts, tunica albuginea cysts, epidermoid cysts, tubular ectasia of rete testis, and intratesticular abscesses. Vascular lesions examined include intratesticular varicocele and intratesticular arteriovenous malformations. Solid lesions examined include fibrous pseudotumor of the testis, focal or segmental testicular infarct, fibrosis of the testis, testicular hematoma, congenital testicular adrenal rests, tuberculoma, and sarcoidosis. Gray-scale and color-flow Doppler sonography facilitate the visualization of the benign characteristics of the lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging can also help as a problem-solving modality in some cases.
