Non-surgical closure of patent ductus arteriosus in children with the Rashkind double disk occluder. Since the first clinical application of transcatheter closure technique for patent ductus arteriosus in children and infants in 1977 by Rashkind and Coll., this technique is routinely performed only in a few major Pediatric Cardiology Centers. We report our successful series which is the first of its kind both in Italy and in Southern Europe. The series included 11 children aged 1.6 to 10 years (mean age 4.5 years) all affected with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Subaortic stenosis (1) and ventricular septal defect with pulmonary stenosis (1) were associated anomalies. In all of the cases, after the standard percutaneous cardiac catheterization, the Mullins method was attempted to advance and deliver the Rashkind PDA double-disk occluder. Successful closure was accomplished in 10 while almost complete closure was achieved in the 11th. Normal Doppler flow pattern after the procedure confirmed the successful results. No complications occurred. Although our experience is limited, non-surgical PDA closure provided an excellent alternative to surgical procedure.
