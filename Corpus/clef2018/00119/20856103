Quantification of aortic stiffness to predict the degree of left ventricular diastolic function. The association between the arterial stiffness and the severity of left ventricular (LV) diastolic function in hypertension has not been fully evaluated. This study was conducted to evaluate the relationship of aortic stiffness by brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) to parameters reflecting the atherosclerosis and the severity of LV diastolic function in patients with hypertension.LV ejection fraction, the ratio of peak velocity of early rapid filling and peak velocity of atrial filling (E/A ratio) and LV mass index were determined with echocardiography in 800 patients with hypertension. LV diastolic function was estimated by pulsed-tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) echocardiography, averaging diastolic mitral annular velocity measurements (Emav, Amav and Emav/Amav ratio) from 2 separate sites (basal septal and lateral). The baPWV was measured by the volume rendering method.Stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the independent factors of LV diastolic function were deceleration time, baPWV, age and Emav/Amav ratio. The receiver- operator characteristic curve demonstrated a baPWV of 1566 cm/sec was useful to discriminate mild LV diastolic dysfunction (sensitivity, 78% specificity, 78%), and that a baPWV of 1730 cm/sec was useful to discriminate moderate LV diastolic dysfunction (sensitivity, 73%Increased baPWV relates not only to the parameters reflecting atherosclerosis but also to those reflecting LV diastolic dysfunction. TDI-detected LV diastolic dysfunction is accompanied by increased aortic stiffness in essential hypertension. Therefore, quantification of aortic stiffness can predict the degree of LV diastolic function.
