Plasma glucose levels and white blood cell count are related with ankle brachial index in type 2 diabetic subjects. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a major risk factor for peripheral arterial disease (PAD). A simple, noninvasive method for the estimation of PAD is ankle brachial index (ABI). The aim of the present study was to determine whether there is an association between ABI and cardiovascular risk factors in T2DM subjects without apparent macrovascular disease.A total of 125 T2DM subjects (84 males, 41 females, mean age ± standard deviation 62.2 ± 9.1 years) who had no apparent macrovascular disease and who attended the Health Center of Erymantheia between January 2008 and June 2009 were recruited to the study.Of the study subjects 20% (n=25) had ABI <0.90. Univariate linear regression analysis showed that ABI was significantly associated with history of hypertension (p=0.02), fasting serum glucose levels (p=0.02), serum urea levels (p=0.005), serum uric acid levels (p=0.007) and white blood cell (WBC) count (p=0.04). Multivariate linear regression analysis demonstrated significant independent associations between ABI and fasting serum glucose levels (p=0.03) as well as WBC count (p=0.03).Elevated plasma glucose and WBC count increase the risk of PAD in asymptomatic diabetics.
