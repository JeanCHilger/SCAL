Express LD vascular stent in the treatment of iliac artery lesions: 24-month results from the MELODIE trial. To report the 2-year results of the MELODIE trial, which evaluated the safety and effectiveness of the balloon-expandable Express LD Vascular stent for the treatment of atherosclerotic iliac artery disease.This prospective, multicenter, single-arm trial enrolled 151 patients (113 men mean age 60.1Â±8.4 years) with 163 de novo or restenotic iliac lesions. The primary endpoint, 6-month angiographic mean percent loss of luminal diameter, was compared to an objective performance criterion (OPC) based on published results with the Palmaz stent. Follow-up included ankle-brachial index (ABI) measurement and symptom assessment (Fontaine classification) at discharge, 30 days, and 6, 12, and 24 months. Arteriography was performed at 6 months and computed tomographic angiography (CTA) at 1 and 2 years.The primary endpoint of 6-month mean percent luminal diameter loss was 16.2% (upper 95% confidence boundary of 19.1%) and non-inferior to the 20% OPC (p = 0.006). Primary patency was 92.1% at 6 months and 87.8% at 2 years. The rate of major adverse events (MAE) was 6.3% at 6 months and 10.2% at 2 years. Of the 3 event types included in the definition of MAE, only target lesion revascularization occurred no distal embolization or device- or procedure-related deaths were recorded. The percent of patients with Fontaine stage IIb symptoms or worse improved from 84.1% before the procedure to 16.8% at 2 years (p<0.0001). The 2-year ABI remained significantly improved compared to baseline (0.85 versus 0.63, p<0.0001).The Express LD Vascular stent is safe, effective, and non-inferior to the Palmaz stent for treatment of iliac artery stenosis.
