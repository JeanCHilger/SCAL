Increased serum N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels in patients with medial arterial calcification and poorly compressible leg arteries. To determine whether serum levels of N-terminal (NT) pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) are higher in patients with poorly compressible arteries (PCA) than in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) and control subjects without PCA or PAD.Medial arterial calcification in the lower extremities results in PCA and may be associated with increased arterial stiffness and hemodynamic/myocardial stress. PCA was defined as having an ankle-brachial index >1.4 or an ankle blood pressure >255 mm Hg, whereas PAD was defined as having an ankle-brachial index ≤0.9. Study participants with PCA (n=100 aged 71±10 yearsPatients with medial arterial calcification and PCA have higher serum levels of NT pro-BNP than patients with PAD and controls, which is suggestive of an adverse hemodynamic milieu and increased risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes.
