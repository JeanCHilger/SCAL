Prevalence of moderate or severe chronic kidney disease in patients with severe peripheral arterial disease versus mild or moderate peripheral arterial disease. To investigate the prevalence of moderate or severe chronic kidney disease in patients with severe versus mild or moderate peripheral arterial disease.We investigated the prevalence of moderate or severe chronic kidney disease diagnosed as an estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 in 130 patients with severe peripheral arterial disease (ankle-brachial index <0.60) and in 192 patients with mild or moderate peripheral arterial disease (ankle-brachial index 0.60-0.89) seen in a vascular surgery outpatient clinic.An estimated glomerular filtration rate of <30 ml/min/1.73 m2 was present in 51 of 322 patients (16%) with peripheral arterial disease, of 30-59 ml/min/1.73 m2 was present in 172 of 322 patients (53%) with peripheral arterial disease, and of â‰¥60 ml/min/1.73 m2 was present in 99 of 322 patients (31%) with peripheral arterial disease. An estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 was present in 105 of 130 patients (81%) with an ankle-brachial index <0.60 and in 118 of 192 patients (61%) with an ankle-brachial index of 0.60-0.89 (p<0.001).The prevalence of moderate or severe chronic kidney disease is high in patients with peripheral arterial disease and is significantly higher (p<0.001) in patients with severe peripheral arterial disease than in patients with mild or moderate peripheral arterial disease.
