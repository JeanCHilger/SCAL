Aortic strain, distensibility and elastic modulus are associated with the presence and quantity of coronary calcium. An association between aortic stiffness and atherosclerosis has been previously demonstrated by pulse wave velocity. Whether echocardiographically assessed aortic stiffness also correlates with the extent of atherosclerosis has not yet been established.To evaluate the association between echocardiographically measured aortic stiffness and atherosclerosis.A total of 162 patients (mean age 54±9 years, age range 36-83 years, 102 male and 60 female) at high risk of atherosclerosis underwent transthoracic echocardiography and sphygmomanometer-based brachial blood pressure measurement for aortic stiffness parameters (strain, distensibility and elastic modulus), and multidetector computed tomography for the presence and quantity of coronary artery calcium (CAC).It was found that aortic strain and distensibility were significantly lower in patients with CAC than in patients without CAC (7.6±2.7% vs 9.3±3.4%, p<0.001 and 3.0±1.1 mm Hg(-1).10(-3) vs 3.9±1.7 mm Hg(-1).10(-3), p<0.001, respectively). However, elastic modulus E(p) was significantly higher in patients with CAC than in patients without CAC (7.9±3.8 N/m2 vs 6.0±2.5 N/m2, p=0.001). In addition, aortic strain and distensibility, and elastic modulus, were found to be significant predictors of the presence and quantity of CAC in multivariate logistic and linear regression analyses (all p<0.05).Echocardiographically measured aortic stiffness is positively, significantly and independently associated with atherosclerosis.
