Ultrasonic evaluation of regional hemodynamics in arteriosclerosis obliterans of the iliac and femoral arteries. Regional hemodynamics was studied in 120 patients with atherosclerosis obliterans of the iliac and femoral arteries by ultrasonic Dopplerometry. Regional malleolar systolic pressure, malleolar-upper arm index, and regional systolic perfusion pressure deficit (RSPPD) were determined by an elaborated method. The authors analyse the values of regional hemodynamics according to the severity of the trophic disorders and type of the occlusive lesion of the iliac and femoral arteries. It was established that, being an integral characteristic, RSPPD allows the degree of limb ischemia to be characterized quantitatively most informatively with consideration for the condition of the central hemodynamics.
