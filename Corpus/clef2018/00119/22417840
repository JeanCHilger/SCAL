Atherosclerosis risk in HIV-infected patients: the influence of hepatitis C virus co-infection. The influence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection on atherosclerosis risk in HIV-infected patients has not been adequately evaluated in real-life situations.We compared indexes of early atherosclerosis evaluated by echo-Doppler ultrasound (presence of plaque in carotid or femoral arteries) in 18 HCV-HIV co-infected patients versus 22 HIV mono-infected patients.Prevalence of subclinical carotid plaque was significantly higher in HCV-HIV co-infected patients (p=0.04), despite of the fact LDL-cholesterol and blood pressure (BP) were lower in the co-infected patients (p=0.003). HCV chronic infection (OR=10 IC: 1.5-72This cross sectional study suggests that HCV infection might be an independent cardiovascular risk factor in HCV-HIV co-infected patients. HCV infection might be considered as not only a liver infection but also as a metabolic disease in HIV patients, justifying regular cardiovascular surveillance.
