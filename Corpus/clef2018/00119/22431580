Orthostatic hypotension as a risk factor for incident heart failure: the atherosclerosis risk in communities study. Heart failure causes significant morbidity and mortality. Distinguishing risk factors for incident heart failure can help identify at-risk individuals. Orthostatic hypotension may be a risk factor for incident heart failure however, this association has not been fully explored, especially in nonwhite populations. The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study included 12363 adults free of prevalent heart failure with baseline orthostatic measurements. Orthostatic hypotension was defined as a decrease of systolic blood pressure ≥20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥10 mmHg with position change from supine to standing. Incident heart failure was identified from hospitalization or death certificate disease codes. Over 17.5 years of follow-up, orthostatic hypotension was associated with incident heart failure with multivariable adjustment (hazard ratio: 1.54 [95% CI: 1.30-1.82]). This association was similar across race and sex groups. A stronger association was identified in younger individuals ≤55 years old (hazard ratio: 1.90 [95% CI: 1.41-2.55]) than in older individuals >55 years old (hazard ratio: 1.37 [95% CI: 1.12-1.69]
