Vascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction in fracture healing. Angiogenesis is an important step in bone fracture healing. In this article, we report on the healing of long bone fractures, and the involvement of the vascular and the inflammatory systems in the process. We conducted a prospective study of 20 healthy adults with traumatic long bone fracture. One week after fracture, and then 1 month later, we evaluated markers of inflammation: vascular responsiveness (brachial endothelial function and ankle brachial index) and inflammatory and cytokine levels osteopontin [OPN], E-selectin, and vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]). Long bone fractures caused intense vascular and inflammatory responses, represented by high levels of OPN, Eselectin, and VEGF. In vivo measurements demonstrated severe endothelial dysfunction, which could support the idea that the vascular system is recruited to build new blood vessels that support bone regeneration.
