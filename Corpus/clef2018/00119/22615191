Red cell distribution width and risk of peripheral artery disease: analysis of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2004. Red cell distribution width (RDW) is an independent predictor of the 10-year estimated risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) events. However, RDW's association with peripheral artery disease (PAD) - a CHD risk equivalent - has not been evaluated to date. In this cross-sectional study, we examined 6950 participants of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999-2004. PAD was defined as an ankle-brachial index below 0.9 (n = 618). RDW was divided into quartiles (Q) (Q1: â‰¤ 12.2 Q2: 12.3-12.5
