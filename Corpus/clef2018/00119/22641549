Atherosclerosis burden and coronary artery lesion complexity in acute coronary syndrome patients. Syntax score (SS) is a prognostic marker in patients with acute coronary sydromes (ACS). Carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) and cardio ankle vascular index (CAVI) are well known surrogate marker of atherosclerosis burden. But association between atherosclerosis burden and coronary artery disease (CAD) complexity in ACS patients has not been investigated yet.Consecutive patients with first time diagnosis of ACS (n = 172) were enrolled. SS, a marker of CAD complexity, was assessed by dedicated computer software. CIMT was examined by B-mode ultrasound. CAVI was assessed by VaSera VS-1000 cavi instrument. SS for low, intermediate and high tertiles of CIMT value were 10.1 ± 8.2 vs 11.4 ± ± 7.9 and 15.2 ± 8.8 p = 0.02). SS for normal, borderline and abnormal CAVI values were 4 ± 3.7 vs 11.1 ± 7.2 and 14.1 ± 9.1, respectively p = 0.009). Also, there was independent association between SS and CIMT (95% coinfidence interval [CI] 2.1-19, p = 0.014) and CAVI (95% CI 15-29, p = 0.021]. Neither traditional cardiovascular risk factor nor thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) risk score was independent determinant of SS.We have shown that patients with higher atherosclerosis burden have more complex coronary artery lesions. Also these patients may be identified early by using surrogate markers of atherosclerosis. Its clinical significance requires further research.
