A comparison of tibial artery bypass performed with heparin-bonded expanded polytetrafluoroethylene and great saphenous vein to treat critical limb ischemia. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) bonded with heparin (HePTFE) has been reported to perform equivalent to saphenous vein graft (SVG) for below-knee bypass. This series examines outcomes for tibial artery bypass using HePTFE and SVG over a contemporaneous time period.A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data was conducted for 112 tibial bypasses (62 HePTFE, 50 SVG) performed from November 2006 to January 2009. Demographics for age, sex, race, diabetes mellitus, and end-stage renal disease were similar. Indications for revascularization were also similar: disabling claudication, 9% rest pain, 25%HePTFE and SVG bypasses demonstrated no significant differences in target tibial artery distribution: anterior tibial (15 vs 17), dorsalis pedis (4 vs 5), posterior tibial (22 vs 16), and peroneal (21 vs 12). Graft occlusion occurred in 19 patients (16.9%) during follow-up. Primary patency at 1 year was 75.4% for HePTFE and 86.0% for SVG. There was no significant difference in primary patency due to sex (male, 78% female, 84%), race (white, 82%This experience indicates a trend for single-segment quality saphenous vein to remain the conduit of choice for tibial artery bypass compared with HePTFE. Factors relevant to decreased 1-year patency for the entire cohort were end-stage renal disease and nonhealing ulceration as the indication for revascularization. Although relatively short-term, these results do support HePTFE as a viable alternative conduit for patients with absent or poor quality saphenous vein who need a tibial bypass.
