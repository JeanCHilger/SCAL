The effectiveness of skin perfusion pressure measurements during endovascular therapy in determining the endpoint in critical limb ischemia. A 78-year-old man had right foot ulceration. The skin perfusion pressure (SPP) at the dorsum was 12 mmHg. Angiography revealed right iliac artery occlusion and diffuse stenosis of right superficial femoral artery. After stenting of the iliac arteries, the SPP was still 23 mmHg. Hence, we also inserted stents in the right superficial femoral artery. The anterior tibial artery remained stenosed, and the posterior tibial and fibular arteries were occluded. However, as the SPP had increased to 46 mmHg the treatment was discontinued. The ulcers improved. Measurement of SPP during a procedure may be useful in determining the treatment endpoint.
