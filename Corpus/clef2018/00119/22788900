Endovascular treatment of popliteal artery segments P1 and P2 in patients with critical limb ischemia: initial experience using a helical nitinol stent with increased radial force. To evaluate efficacy, safety, and midterm patency of a helical, self-expanding nitinol stent after failed percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of popliteal artery segments P1 and P2 in patients with chronic critical limb ischemia (CLI) or lifestyle-limiting claudication.Between February 2009 and March 2011, 40 patients (23 men mean age 77±10 years) classified as Rutherford category 3 (n = 10) or 4/5 (n = 30) underwent PTA of the proximal and mid popliteal artery followed by implantation of a SUPERA stent for elastic recoil, residual stenosis, or flow-limiting dissection. All patients had an elevated operative risk. Before and after the procedure and during the 12-month follow-up, a clinical investigation, ankle-brachial-index (ABI) measurement, and color-coded duplex sonography and/or digital subtraction angiography were performed. Primary endpoints were limb salvage and anatomical patency at 12 months.Stent implantation was successful in all patients. The major complication rate was 7.5% (an access-site pseudoaneurysm, 2 retroperitoneal hematomas, and 1 death from retroperitoneal bleeding). Mean follow-up was 15.9 months (range 0.5-27.9). The mean baseline ABI of 0.37 significantly increased to 0.91 at 12 months (p<0.01). Three (7.5%) patients underwent bypass surgery owing to lack of clinical improvement (<0.10 improvement in ABI). Primary and secondary patency rates at 12 months in the 34 patients eligible for follow-up were 68.4% and 79.8%, respectively. The major amputation rate was 5% at 1 year. Five (12.5%) in-stent stenoses and 1 of 2 (5.0%) in-stent occlusions were successfully recanalized (the second occlusion was asymptomatic).Implantation of this helical stent into segments of the popliteal artery at the knee joint in CLI patients is a safe and clinically effective bailout method with acceptable intermediate patency.
