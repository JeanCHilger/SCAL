Acceleration of collateral development by carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 expression on CD11b/⁺Gr-1⁺ myeloid cells--brief report. Previously, we demonstrated the relevance for endothelial carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) expression in collateral formation. However, a proarteriogenic role for CEACAM1(+) myeloid cells is unknown. Here, we investigated the contribution of CEACAM1(+) myeloid cells on collateral formation.Collateral growth and vascular remodeling were analyzed in CEACAM1-competent and CEACAM1 null mice after femoral artery ligation in hindlimb ischemia. Reperfusion of the adductor muscles was evaluated by Laser Doppler measurements and microcomputed tomography imaging. In CEACAM1 null mice, poor reperfusion and reduced collateral formation were observed, accompanied by reduction in arterial diameters. Using flow cytometry, we identified an increase of the muscle-resident CD11b(+)/granulocyte receptor-1+ (Gr-1+) population in CEACAM1 null mice only, pointing toward a CEACAM1-dependent functional deviation. Direct and reciprocal bone marrow transplantations between CEACAM1-competent and CEACAM1 null mice, and antibody-mediated depletion of the CD11b(+)/Gr-1(+) population, confirmed the requirement of CEACAM1 expression on the CD11b(+)/Gr-1(+) population for reestablishment of perfusion after arterial occlusion.CEACAM1 expression on CD11b(+)/Gr-1(+) myeloid cells is a prerequisite for adequate collateral formation.
