CD36 gene is associated with thickness of atheromatous plaque and ankle-brachial index in patients with early coronary artery disease. CD36 is a multifunctional molecule engaged in the removal of oxidised LDL from plasma. It is unclear whether mutation of the CD36 gene protects against, or increases, the risk of hypercholesterolaemia, atherosclerosis and its complications.To search for associations between the CD36 gene polymorphisms and radiological markers of atherosclerosis progress in Caucasian patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) diagnosed at a young age.The study group comprised 70 patients with early CAD. Doppler ultrasound of carotid and peripheral arteries was carried out and genomic DNA was isolated from each patient.We found two single nucleotide substitutions in introns (IVS3-6 T/C - rs3173798 and IVS4-10 G/A - rs3211892) and two synonymous polymorphisms in exon 6 (G573A - rs5956 and A591T). The allele frequencies were: 10.7% for the IVS3-6C, 3.6% for the IVS4-10A, 3.6% for the 573A, and 2.1% for the 591T. The 573A allele of CD36 rs5956 polymorphism is associated with low thickness of atheromatous plaque. The 591T allele is associated with lower ankle-brachial index.The 573A allele has a protective effect against atherosclerosis development and the 591T allele is a cardiovascular risk factor. Assessment of their functional implications requires further research.
