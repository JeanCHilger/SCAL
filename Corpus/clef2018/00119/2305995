Capillary filtration and ankle edema in patients with venous hypertension treated with TTFCA. The variation of capillary filtration rate (CFR), ankle circumference (AC), and ankle edema (AE) was evaluated in three groups of patients with venous hypertension (ambulatory venous pressure greater than 42 mmHg) and in a group of normal subjects before and after treatment for four weeks with Total Triterpenic fraction of Centella Asiatica (TTFCA), a venoactive drug acting on the microcirculation and on capillary permeability. Group A (20 patients) was treated with TTFCA 60 mg tid Group B (20 patients) was treated with 30 mg tid
