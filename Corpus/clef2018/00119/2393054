Effects and limitations of pentoxifylline therapy in various stages of peripheral vascular disease of the lower extremity. One hundred one patients with peripheral vascular disease of the lower extremity were entered into a study of the efficacy of oral pentoxifylline to determine if the response to therapy varied with the severity of disease. Ninety-three patients were evaluated before and after 8 weeks of therapy with pentoxifylline, while 8 did not complete the entire course due to adverse drug reactions. Resting and post-stress ankle/arm Doppler indices (AAIs) were measured and, in those patients who could walk on a treadmill, treadmill walking distances were measured. Patients were classified according to pretreatment clinical and treadmill measurements and according to pretreatment resting AAIs. Resting and post-stress AAIs, as well as treadmill walking distances, increased in patients with moderately severe claudication. Patients in this group responded better to therapy than did patients with rest pain or ischemic ulcers, severe claudication, or mild claudication. Patients with a pretreatment resting AAI greater than or equal to 0.5 responded better than those with an AAI less than 0.5. Only 5% of patients reported satisfaction with the results of treatment. These results support the findings that pentoxifylline may be useful only in selected patients with moderately severe peripheral vascular disease of the lower extremity and may not be useful in those with severe or mild disease.
