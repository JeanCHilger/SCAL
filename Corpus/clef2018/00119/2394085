The effect of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) on human forearm blood flow. The effect of intravenous and intra-arterially administered calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) on the human forearm blood flow and cutaneous blood flow were investigated by means of venous occlusion plethysmography and laser-Doppler flowmetry, respectively. Infusion of CGRP (11-216 pmol min-1) into the brachial artery resulted in a dose-dependent increase in forearm blood flow and cutaneous blood flow which persisted for up to 90 min after the infusion was stopped. Repeated infusions resulted in an identical response. Systemic intravenous infusion of CGRP (104-520 pmol min-1) resulted in a dose-dependent flush in the face, neck, upper trunck and upper arms, and an increase in the forearm blood flow. The cutaneous blood flow was dramatically increased on the forehead, whereas on the hand only a slight increase was noted. By intravenous infusions a significant drop in blood pressure and increase in heart rate were seen at 520 pmol min-1. Thus, it is possible to give CGRP in doses that increase the blood flow in muscle and skin without resulting in a fall in systemic arterial blood pressure and tachycardia, suggesting that CGRP may be used as a tool for the treatment of various conditions in man with compromised blood flow.
