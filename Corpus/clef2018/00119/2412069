Comparison of blood pressure ratio by Doppler velocimetry and by plethysmography during treatment with ketanserin, a 5-HT2 receptor antagonist: a measure of improved collateral and microcirculatory flow. We could demonstrate a progressive and significant increase in blood pressure ratio (thigh/arm) in 42 patients with intermittent claudication, treated with ketanserin for 9 months, which confirms our earlier double-blind placebo-controlled findings. In an additional experiment comparing blood pressure ratio with Doppler velocimetry and with plethysmography, an upwards shift was observed for the plethysmographic values as compared with the Doppler values during ketanserin therapy, and only at the level of the thigh, which suggests an improvement of the collateral and microcirculatory flow.
