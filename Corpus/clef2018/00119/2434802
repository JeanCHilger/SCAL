Perindopril, converting enzyme blockade, and peripheral arterial hemodynamics in the healthy volunteer. The effects of three doses (4, 8, and 16 mg) of perindopril, a new angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor, on systemic blood pressure, heart rate, brachial and carotid artery flow and diameter (assessed by the pulsed Doppler technique), forearm vascular resistance, plasma converting enzyme and renin activities, and plasma aldosterone were investigated in the normal volunteer and compared with those of a placebo over a 24-h period following oral drug intake in a double-blind, crossover trial. Perindopril dose-dependently decreased plasma converting enzyme activity, an effect that peaked at 3-4 h and persisted up to at least 48 h. Plasma renin activity increased for 12 h and plasma aldosterone was slightly decreased. Systemic blood pressure and heart rate were not drug-affected but perindopril dose-dependently augmented brachial and carotid artery flow, indicating an increase in peripheral arterial compliance. These vasodilating effects, which lasted up to 10 h after drug intake, affected both large arteries and arterioles, the latter being more sensitive, however, and were more marked in the muscular resistance vessels.
