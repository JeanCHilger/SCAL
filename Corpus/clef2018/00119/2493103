Are free radical scavengers beneficial in the treatment of compartment syndrome after acute arterial ischemia? Because it is postulated that compartment syndrome developing secondary to an acute arterial occlusion may be due to reperfusion injury, oxygen-derived free radicals have been implicated in its genesis. To assess the possible beneficial effect of free radical scavengers in this setting, we used a previously established in vivo canine model of compartment syndrome to compare four groups: group I, no treatment group II, prophylactic fasciotomy
