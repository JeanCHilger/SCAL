Discrimination attempt between stenoses of the left trunk and tritroncular involvement using univariate and multivariate analysis of the variables of the exercise test. One hundred and fifty patients with more than 70 p. 100 three vessel (3V) stenosis and 69 patients with more than 50 p. 100 left main (LM) coronary artery stenosis underwent an exercise test at maximum or symptom-limited level, after discontinuing all anti-ischaemic therapies. Three comparative statistical methods were used: 1. Univariate analysis. Among the mean values of the 17 variables studied, 6 differed significantly (p less than 0.05), viz.: cardiac work performed until the appearance, on the CM5 lead, of an ST depression (STd) of 1 mm (W1) (LM = 1,002 Kpm 3V = 1,461 Kpm) and of 2 mm (W2) (LM = 2,445 Kpm
