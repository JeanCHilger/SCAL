Laser Doppler monitoring of replants using a small prism probe. Eighteen patients admitted to Duke University Medical Center for upper limb replantation or revascularization were studied. A small laser Doppler flow prism probe and a cutaneous temperature probe were attached to the distal pulp of replanted digits. Measurements were recorded hourly for the first 3 postoperative days. In the successful cases, the mean laser Doppler flow measurement was 1.76 units (lower 97% confidence limit 0.5 units) and the mean temperature was 34.1 degrees C (lower 97% confidence limit 32 degrees C). In 4 patients with vascular compromise, the laser Doppler flow correctly identified the problem. The reduced size of the new laser Doppler probe makes monitoring of distal pulp flow technically easier while maintaining accuracy.
