Fibromuscular dysplasia of the renal artery in a child: detection by Doppler ultrasound and correction by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. We describe the case of a fourteen-year old girl with hypertension, in whom renal arterial stenosis was identified by Doppler ultrasound examination, with subsequent demonstration of typical features of fibromuscular dysplasia by selective renal arteriography. Percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty was performed, and a sustained improvement in renal arterial flow was confirmed by follow-up Doppler ultrasound examinations.
