Angiography and functional results and histologic findings following percutaneous atherectomy in patients with arterial occlusive disease. In this study we report on the atherectomy technique, acute and long-term data, and histological findings of excised specimens from patients with peripheral vascular disease treated with the Simpson atherectomy catheter. Forty patients with a total of 72 lesions of the iliac (n = 5), superficial femoral (n = 62), and popliteal (n = 5) arteries could be treated five patients had rest pain and two had gangrene. The primary success rate (of all lesions, including total occlusions and longer stenoses) was over 90%. The percent of stenosis decreased from 87.2 +/- 19.9% to 16.6 +/- 15.5%
