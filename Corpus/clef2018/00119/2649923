Deep veins of the calf: assessment with color Doppler flow imaging. The authors studied the ability of real-time ultrasound aided by color Doppler flow imaging to demonstrate the deep veins of the calf in ten healthy subjects and 49 patients (91 limbs) with suspected deep venous thrombosis. Posterior tibial and peroneal veins demonstrated flow accentuation in 98% (74 of 75) and 96% (72 of 75), respectively, of the limbs without thrombosis and in all 20 normal limbs. Sixteen legs were involved with deep venous thrombosis. Peroneal veins could not be seen in three legs with marked calf swelling due to proximal thrombosis. There were two cases of thrombosis limited to the calf, nine of popliteal thrombosis (seven with contiguous spread of thrombus), and five of thrombosis limited to above the knee (four with sparing of the deep veins of the calf). Visualization of anterior tibial veins, achieved in 65% of all legs, did not correlate with thrombosis. The authors conclude that color Doppler flow imaging can demonstrate patency of posterior tibial and peroneal veins in most patients without deep venous thrombosis and aid in detection of below-the-knee thrombosis.
