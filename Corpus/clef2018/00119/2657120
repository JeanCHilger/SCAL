Avoiding reperfusion injury after limb revascularization: experimental observations and recommendations for clinical application. This study tests the hypothesis that reperfusion injury is the principal cause of limb loss after acute arterial occlusion and that this injury is avoidable. Of 61 isolated hindlimbs amputated at the level of the hip joint, 17 were controls (group I), 5 were perfused without ischemia to establish the validity of the model (group II), and 15 underwent 4 hours of ischemia at room temperature without reperfusion (group III). Acute embolectomy was simulated in 24 limbs after 4 hours of ischemia 12 were reperfused with standard Krebs-Henseleit solution at 100 mm Hg (group IV), and 12 were reperfused under controlled conditions (i.e., 37 degrees C, 50 mm Hg) with substrate-enriched modified reperfusate (group V). Leg volume, water content, contractile function, and high-energy phosphate content were assessed and data were expressed as mean +/- SD. Four hours of ischemia caused a profound fall in adenosine triphosphate content (4.0 vs 26.0 mmol/L/gm of protein, p less than or equal to 0.001). Uncontrolled reperfusion resulted in severe reperfusion injury
