The current role of Doppler echocardiography in the diagnosis of heart disease in children. New Doppler ultrasound technology has caused a change in the approach to the diagnosis of congenital heart disease. Pulsed Doppler ultrasound continues to be of great value for measuring cardiac output ventricular performance and for calculating pulmonary to systemic flow ratios. Continuous wave Doppler ultrasound by virtue of its ability to detect high velocity accurately remains the premier technique for determining pressure drop across valves or across shunts. Pulsed Doppler ultrasound remains a valuable test for defining many lesions including patent ductus arteriosus.
