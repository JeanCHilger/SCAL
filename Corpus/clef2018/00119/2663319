Calcium blocker lacidipine and carotid arteriolar vasodilation in healthy volunteers. Systemic and carotid hemodynamics were studied in 10 healthy male volunteers before and after short-term administration of a 4 mg dose of the calcium entry-blocker lacidipine in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study. Hemodynamic parameters of the right common carotid artery were measured before and at 1 1/2 and 3 hours after dose administration by means of pulsed Doppler flowmetry. In addition, systemic hemodynamic parameters were calculated from cardiac impedance measurements at the same time. In comparison with placebo, lacidipine produced a significant decrease in blood pressure, together with systemic and carotid arteriolar dilatation. Heart rate increased sharply, whereas carotid arterial diameter and tangential tension did not change. The study provided evidence that the calcium entry-blocker lacidipine produces systemic and carotid arteriolar vasodilation and that the heart rate baroreflex response after administration of calcium inhibitor is not associated with a significant modification of the geometry of carotid arterial wall.
