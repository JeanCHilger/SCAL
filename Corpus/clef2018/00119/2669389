Findings of pulse palpation and non-invasively measured blood pressure values of the posterior tibial artery in arterial occlusive disease. In 37 test persons with healthy vessels and 103 patients with arterial obstructive disease the clinical findings of the pulse palpation were related to the results of the systolic Doppler pressure measurement in the region of the posterior tibial artery. The experience of the investigator, physical influences, local extravascular factors as well as parameters of the central haemodynamics proved to be significant. A palpation of the pulse was successful in peripheral systolic pressure values lying higher than 90 Torr, so that here a judgement of the function alone became possible with the help of the palpatory pressure measurement of the posterior tibial artery. Unfavourable local conditions, however, can be followed by negative tactile findings of the pulse also in higher pressure values.
