Comparative long-term vasoactive effects of atenolol and carteolol on the properties of the small and large arteries of the upper extremities in human essential hypertension. The long-term effects of selective (atenolol) and nonselective (carteolol) beta-blockers on brachial artery diameter velocity and flow and on vascular resistance (pulsed Doppler) were compared in two groups of 10 hypertensive patients at respective daily doses of 100 and 20 mg. The drugs decreased mean blood pressure (p less than 0.01) with similar magnitude, although systolic blood pressure was decreased more by atenolol than by carteolol (p less than 0.05). Heart rate was decreased by atenolol (p less than 0.01) but was unchanged by carteolol. The drugs did not change brachial circulation when the hand circulation was present. During hand exclusion (wrist occlusion) comparison from baseline showed that atenolol decreased velocity and flow (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.05) and increased resistance (p less than 0.05), whereas carteolol decreased resistance (p less than 0.05) after 3 months of treatment, velocity and flow were higher (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.001) and resistance was lower (p less than 0.01) with carteolol than with atenolol. Thus, hand exclusion demonstrated opposite drug effects on arterioles--dilation for carteolol and constriction for atenolol.
