Applications and limitations of laser-assisted angioplasty. Laser-assisted angioplasty is rapidly evolving into a promising adjunct to or replacement for standard vascular procedures. A protocol was devised to evaluate the technique in a non-selected, consecutive patient population to define the applications and limitations of the technique. In a 12-month period, 358 lower-limb atherosclerotic lesions were treated with laser/balloon angioplasty [percutaneously (52%) or open (48%)] in 206 consecutive patients. Overall, the laser/balloon technique recanalised 234 lesions (65% laser success), judged clinically effective by a greater than 0.15 improvement in the ankle/brachial index and elimination of symptoms. Operative complications included: perforation (15, 4.2%) thrombosis (16, 4.5%)
