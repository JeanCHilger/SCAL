Long-term results after implantation of the femoro-popliteal vein graft in relation to preoperative values of the ankle pressure index and peroperative flow. The authors investigated the importance of ankle pressure indices (aPi), peroperative blood flow and angiographic findings on peripheral arteries for the long-term patency of F-P venous bypasses. They found that neither the preoperative value of aPi nor the size of the peroperative flow through the bypass has an impact on the long-term patency of the reconstruction. As a result of general factors which lead to progression of the atherothrombosis in the arterial circulation in the implanted bypass, obstructions of the reconstruction occur even in patients with high preoperative aPi values and with a major preoperative flow, with patent peripheral arteries at the time of operation. To improve long-term results after implantation of F-P venous bypasses therefore above all prevention of the progression of atherosclerosis is essential.
