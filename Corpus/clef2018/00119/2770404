The importance of the claudication test performed on a treadmill and its use in clinical practice. A group of 55 patients with lower limb occlusive arterial disease was submitted to a treadmill walking exercise test in order to estimate the walking exercise length. The treadmill speed was fixed at 3 km/h and the carpet incline was 0% and 12% respectively. Doppler method for blood pressure estimation was applied in 10 patients to art. brachialis and art. dorsalis pedis bilaterally prior to and 2.5 and 10 minutes after the test. The ankle pressure index was calculated prior and post exercise. Results showed 51 +/- 9% difference between patients walking (3 km/h/0%) and patients climbing (3 km/h/12%). Ischaemic pain and blood pressure fall over art. dorsalis pedis during exercise correlated significantly 2 and 5 minutes after the test. Arteria dorsalis pedis pressure at rest and 2 and 5 minutes post exercise was statistically significant. Blood pressure indices prior and post exercise were related in the same manner. There was no difference in art. dorsalis pedis pressure and ankle pressure indices in our control group. The walking treadmill exercise test showed to be a simple reliable method for estimation of the functional degree of lower limb arterial insufficiency and for assessment of their surgical or drug therapy.
