Occlusion pressures vs. micropipette pressures in the pulmonary circulation. Because of the discrepancies between the arterial and venous occlusion technique and the micropuncture technique in estimating pulmonary capillary pressure gradient, we compared measurements made with the two techniques in the same preparations (isolated left lower lobe of dog lung). In addition, we also obtained direct and reliable measurements of pressures in 0.9-mm arteries and veins using a retrograde catheterization technique, as well as a microvascular pressure made with the double-occlusion technique. The following conclusions were made from dog lobes perfused with autologous blood at normal flow rate of 500-600 ml/min and pressure gradient of 12 mmHg. 1) The double-occlusion technique measures pressure in the capillaries, 2) a small pressure gradient (0.5 mmHg) exists between 30- to 50-micron arteries and veins, 3) a large pressure gradient occurs in arteries and veins greater than 0.9 mm, 4) the arterial and venous occlusion techniques measure pressures in vessels that are less than 900 microns diam but greater than 50 microns, very likely close to 100 microns, 5) serotonin constricts arteries (larger and smaller than 0.9 mm) whereas histamine constricts veins (larger and smaller than 0.9 mm). Thus three different techniques (small retrograde catheter, arterial and venous occlusion, and micropuncture) show consistent results, confirming the presence of significant resistance in large arteries and veins with minimal resistance in the microcirculation.
