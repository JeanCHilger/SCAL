The femoral arterial flow velocity pattern in patients with aortoiliac atherosclerosis. Studies with a pulsed Doppler ultrasound flowmeter. The femoral arterial flow velocity pattern in 164 limbs with aortoiliac atherosclerosis was analyzed preoperatively, using a pulsed wave Doppler ultrasound flowmeter. Following aortoiliac reconstruction, 32 limbs were studied. The highest (Va), the lowest (Vb) and the time average of the mean velocities (V mean) were obtained, and pulsatility index (PI = Va-Vb/V mean) was calculated. The aortoiliac obstruction was radiologically graded as reduction in cross-sectional area (less than 25%, 25-50%, greater than 50%) or complete occlusion. With increasing grade of stenosis, progressive reduction of PI (from 7.6 to 2.1) was observed. PI differed according to degree of obstruction. In 30 extremities with clinical improvement after vascular reconstruction, PI showed significant postoperative rise (from 2.7 to 6.9). In the two limbs without clinical benefit of surgery, PI was largely unaffected. A monophasic, flattened curve of femoral arterial flow velocity and reduced PI may indicate aortoiliac atherosclerosis. Normalization of PI and biphasic curve following aortoiliac reconstruction suggest successful treatment.
