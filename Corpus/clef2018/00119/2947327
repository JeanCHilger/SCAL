Differentiation of breast cancers by Doppler ultrasound. Breast sonography is a well-accepted diagnostic method. For differentiation between benign and malignant lesions quantified sonography is gaining increased importance. In addition to measurements of velocity, attenuation and elastic properties of tissue, analysis of blood flow by CW Doppler ultrasound plays an important role. Malignancies usually show increased vascularity and extremely disorder. The peripheral resistance is low due to numerous AV-shunts in malignant tissue. With high frequency CW Doppler ultrasound (8-10 MHz) these anatomical and physiological features can be outlined objectively. Frequency analysis of Doppler signals in breast malignancies shows high intensities corresponding to increased blood flow. But also a broadening of the systolic peak with flattening of systolic increase and diastolic decrease as well as high diastolic flow. The different blood flow directions of the vessels recorded by the ultrasonic Doppler beam also cause broadening of the frequency range. In combination with B-mode ultrasound this method provides information essential for the differentiation of malignancies.
