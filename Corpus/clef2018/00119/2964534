Buttock claudication from isolated bilateral internal iliac arterial stenoses. An unusual case is reported of severe buttock claudication in a woman with normal ankle systolic pressures after exercise, for which the cause was eventually found to be isolated bilateral hypogastric arterial stenosis. Although a normal ankle pressure response to exercise usually rules out vascular obstruction in patients with symptoms suggestive of intermittent claudication, the diagnosis of isolated hypogastric arterial disease should be entertained when a neurogenic or orthopedic explanation can be excluded.
