Calf muscle adaptation in intermittent claudication. Side-differences in muscle metabolic characteristics in patients with unilateral arterial disease. The adaptation of enzyme activities, notably in the oxidative metabolism, and of prerequisites for tissue transport of oxygen in the claudication leg was evaluated by comparing muscle biopsies from the gastrocnemius muscle of the claudication and the symptom-free leg of seven patients with unilateral claudication. The claudication leg had higher activities of a marker enzyme for mitochondrial oxidative capacity, citrate synthase (CS), as well as of the MB and the mitochondrial isoenzyme of creatine kinase (CK), which are considered to be involved in the transfer of high energy phosphate from the mitochondria to the resynthesis of ATP in the cytoplasm. The difference between claudication and healthy leg in activities of these CK isoenzymes were well correlated with the corresponding side difference in CS activity. No significant differences between claudication and healthy leg were found in distribution of muscle fibre types or fibre dimension, capillary density or myoglobin content, nor was there any side difference in phosphofructokinase or lactate dehydrogenase. Side differences tended to be greater in those patients with the most advanced obstructive arterial disease as estimated from non-invasive pressure measurements. It is concluded that in reasonably physically-active patients, the mode of ischaemia to which the claudication leg is subjected leads to a metabolic adaptation characterized by increased activities of enzymes involved in the oxidative metabolism, but no significant adaptation of either the conditions for local oxygen transport, as estimated by myoglobin content, and capillary density, or capacity for anaerobic metabolism.
