Laser Doppler velocimetry of fingertips during heat provocation in normals and in patients with Raynaud's phenomenon. Measurements of Laser Doppler flow were performed on the fingertip during heating in a group of normals and in a group of patients with different types of Raynaud's phenomenon. During heating a group of 24 normals was distinguished from a group of 29 primary Raynaud's patients. A group of 17 patients with secondary Raynaud's phenomenon due to scleroderma and 8 patients with arteriographically proven severe vascular occlusive disease of the fingers showed a significantly lower response in comparison to the two above-mentioned groups. Patients with or without slight or severe trophic skin lesions were identified. In patients with scleroderma the maximal vasodilation during heating was inversely related to the number of organs affected. In conclusion, measurements of the hyperaemia during heating may play a role in determining the degree of obstructive vascular involvement in Raynaud's phenomenon.
