Aorto-Y-bifurcation graft: Dacron versus PTFE. Preliminary results of a randomized prospective study. A randomized prospective study comparing PTFE-Y and Dacron-Y-grafts with regard to function rate, morphology, hemodynamic differences along the proximal anastomosis and body of the graft, complications and quality of material was performed. Between March 1983 and February 1987, 112 patients were admitted to the study. Randomization including the criteria of age, sex, indication to operation (chronic occlusive disease, aneurysm) run-off, diabetes, nicotine consumption and operative approach (transperitoneal, retroextraperitoneal) followed the methods of adaptive randomization developed by Pocock and Simon and was well balanced. Function rate and complications as well as morphological alterations showed no significant differences in either group. During a mean observation period of 24 months, Group I yielded a 97% and Group II a 95% function rate (Kaplan-Meier). In all patients but one in each group with limb graft occlusions (n = 5) function was regained by successful thrombectomy and profundaplasty. With respect to Doppler ultrasound differences in flow pattern, in four patients with enlarged proximal side-end anastomosis and adequate--not to large--incision is recommended performing the proximal anastomosis.
