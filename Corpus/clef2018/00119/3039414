Evaluation of the hemorheologic effects of the eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids in asymptomatic dyslipidemic and arteriopathic subjects. The low incidence of cardiovascular disease in Greenlandic Eskimos is related to the effect of dietary omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. An important anti-atherosclerotic mechanism of compounds such as EPA and DHA consist in the modulation of cell membrane and properties. A change in the lipid composition of the diet and a dietary supplementation with EPA and DHA contribute to suggested potential therapeutic effect on peripheral vascular disease. The Authors report the results obtained by Doppler C.W. ultrasound in hyperlipidemic-arteriopathic patients.
