Diagnosis of arterial occlusive disease of the lower extremities by laser Doppler flowmetry. Laser Doppler Flowmetry offers the possibility of non-invasive and continuous recording of tissue blood flow. Skin blood flux in resting state and during postocclusive reactive hyperemia was measured at the pulpa of the toe in 21 normal lower limbs and in 58 limbs with arterial occlusive disease. Proper assessment of postischemic flux- and time- parameters (beginning of reactive hyperemia, peak flux, time of peak flux and duration of hyperemic flux) permits accurate separation of healthy and diseased limbs.
