Organizational principles of mass screening and therapeutic tactics in arterial/occlusive diseases of the lower extremities. Determination of the ankle-shoulder index (ASI) was used in addition to clinical examination for the detection and monitoring of patients with obliterating arterial lesions of the legs.
