Internal jugular and subclavian vein thrombosis caused by central venous catheters. Evaluation using Doppler blood flow imaging. Thrombosis of the internal jugular vein and the subclavian vein is often caused by central venous catheters. Doppler blood flow imaging (duplex sonography and color flow imaging) is very useful to establish the diagnosis, as soon as signs of venous obstruction occur after placing a catheter. Twenty-six patients with clinically suspected thrombosis were examined in 25 patients thrombosis of the internal jugular or subclavian vein was diagnosed. By means of duplex sonography and color flow imaging, the degree of venous obstruction can easily be determined. The efficiency of therapy can be controlled. With color flow imaging, blood flow direction and velocity can be visualized in color which provides global information about hemodynamics in a short time. Furthermore, color flow imaging is a suitable method to detect even small subcutaneous collaterals.
