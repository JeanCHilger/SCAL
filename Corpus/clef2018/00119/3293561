Arterial blood pressure and its measurement. Pressure is defined as force per unit area. The actual value of the recorded pressure depends on dynamic influences, like acceleration and friction in a moving fluid, and on static influences like the effect of a gravitational field. In the arterial system, four mechanisms exert the main influence on the measured pressure: (1) cardiac output and peripheral resistance, on which the mean value of the pressure depends (2) the flow amplitude and the characteristic impedance of the artery, on which the pressure amplitude depends
