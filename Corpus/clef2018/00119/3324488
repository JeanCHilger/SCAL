Incidence of carotid pathology in patients with chronic arterial insufficiency of the extremities. The frequency of carotid pathology and of some risk factors in the genesis of atherosclerosis was studied in 189 patients. The patients were classified into two groups: group A--58 persons without clinical data for atherosclerosis (conditionally healthy persons) group B--131 patients with chronic arterial failure in the limbs. By means of Doppler sonography a low incidence of carotid pathology was established in group A (3.4%) and a significantly higher incidence in group B (38%). The results were confirmed angiographically. The risk factor were more frequent in group B than in group A. The atherosclerotic process affects simultaneously the peripheral, carotid and coronary arteries. This implies active screening of the carotid arteries in patients with clinically manifested chronic arterial failure in the limbs of with ischemic heart disease. The method of Doppler sonography is the most suitable for that.
