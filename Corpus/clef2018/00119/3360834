Sexual dysfunction as a symptom of arteriosclerosis and a complication to reconstruction of the aorto-iliac segment. 68 males were studied retrospectively after reconstructive surgery on the aorto-iliac segment with regard to sexual function pre- and postoperatively. The parameters used to evaluate the sexual dysfunctions were: penile-brachial-index (PBI), urethral pressure profile, rectal-urethral-temperature-gradient (RUTG), and urinary flow. Furthermore, in all patients a preoperative arteriogram was available and all patients were carefully interviewed on their sexual functions before and after surgery. It is concluded that PBI is a good parameter of the perfusion pressure of the internal iliac artery, which is a significant factor for erectile function. The urethral pressure profile has no relation to erectile function, but the results indicate that peroperative damage of the sympathetic nerves do have a significant influence on retrograde ejaculation postoperatively.
