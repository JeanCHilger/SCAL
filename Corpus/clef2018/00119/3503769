The place of profundaplasty in the surgical treatment of superficial femoral artery occlusion. One-hundred and sixty-three patients in whom an isolated profundaplasty was performed as treatment for superficial femoral artery occlusion were evaluated for postoperative improvement, taking into consideration the degree of stenosis of the profunda origin and the patency of peripheral vessels. One-hundred and eleven (68.1%) patients achieved clinical improvement. Fifty-two patients had to undergo amputation (27 below the knee and 19 above the knee) or distal reconstruction (6 patients) because of unrelieved ischaemia. In patients with Fontaine stage II and III disease (89% and 70% respectively) improvement was observed more often than in those with stage IV disease (53%). Half of the patients had an increase of the resting systolic ankle-brachial arterial pressure index, but the rise was only slight (0.12 +/- 0.1). While radiological information of the presence and degree of a stenosis had little influence on the operative outcome stenosis at the origin of the profunda, when seen and described at operation, resulted in a more frequent improvement in the clinical state and systolic ankle-brachial arterial pressure index. A patent popliteal artery was not necessary for a favourable outcome but the number of patent tibial arteries was important. Whenever two tibial vessels were patent, relief was achieved in 75% of the cases: the existence of one patent tibial artery produced improvement in 64% but if all were occluded only 31% showed improvement. In cases of severe ischaemia, success following profundaplasty is limited and the results are often inadequate. If at least one tibial artery is patent, the alternative is a femoro-crural reconstruction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
