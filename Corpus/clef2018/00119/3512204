Doppler ultrasound recognition of preclinical changes in arterial wall in diabetic subjects: compliance and pulse-wave damping. Doppler ultrasound was used to detect early changes in arteries of the legs by two independent techniques. Pulse-wave velocity was measured to calculate arterial wall compliance and Fourier analysis was used to measure damping of the pulse-wave forms. Ten non-insulin-dependent diabetic men with no clinical evidence of peripheral arterial disease had significantly lower compliance and greater pulse-wave damping than 10 matched nondiabetic control subjects. There was a good correlation between the results for the two different techniques.
