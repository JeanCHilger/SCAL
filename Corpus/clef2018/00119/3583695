Peripheral vascular disease in a middle-aged population sample. The Jerusalem Lipid Research Clinic Prevalence Study. Peripheral artery status and prevalence of peripheral vascular disease were studied in a sample of 1,036 men and 556 women, residents of Jerusalem. Ankle blood pressures determined by the Doppler ultrasound technique (Parks Electronic Lab, USA), were higher in men than in women and increased with age. In a multivariable regression analysis, systolic blood pressure and plasma cholesterol levels were significantly and inversely related to the ankle/arm blood pressure in men, and alcohol intake was inversely associated in women. The prevalence of peripheral vascular disease, as determined by symptoms of intermittent claudication, was 1.3% in men and 1.8% in women absent pedal pulses were found in 1.1% of the men and in 2.0% of the women
