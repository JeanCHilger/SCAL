Role of prostaglandins and kinins in the renal pressor reflex. In previous studies we identified an afferent renal nerve-dependent pressor reflex elicited by acute unilateral renal artery stenosis (50% decrease in renal blood flow) in conscious, instrumented rats with reduced responsiveness of arterial baroreceptor reflexes and the renin-angiotensin system. The pressor reflex involves a neurogenic increase in peripheral resistance. The present study examined the nature of the intrarenal stimulus underlying this renal pressor reflex. Rats were subjected to sinoaortic denervation and, 7 to 10 days later, were chronically instrumented with Doppler flow probes on the right renal artery, superior mesenteric artery, and abdominal aorta and with an occluder on the right renal artery. Following surgical recovery and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (captopril), animals received intravenous isotonic saline, 6% of body weight over 60 minutes. Saline infusion did not alter baseline hemodynamics, vascular neurogenic tone, or responsiveness to tyramine, but it attenuated the reflex by 70%. A second series of experiments examined a possible role for intrarenal prostaglandins, kinins, or adenosine in the activation of renal sensory receptors during renal stenosis. Prostaglandin inhibition with intravenous administration of indomethacin and meclofenamate virtually abolished the reflex in the face of enhanced tyramine responsiveness, whereas kallikrein inhibition (aprotinin) attenuated the reflex pressor response by 33%. Adenosine inhibition with aminophylline or adenosine deaminase had no effect on the reflex these agents and aprotinin did not affect vascular neuroeffector responsiveness (tyramine). The data suggest that the renal pressor reflex may be mediated by renal sensory nerves, possibly chemoreceptors, whose activation could depend on renal excretory function and synthesis of prostaglandins and kinins.
