Changes in peripheral blood pressures after five years of follow-up in non-operated patients with intermittent claudication. Changes in the segmental blood pressures (BP) in the legs after five years of follow-up and factors related to the changes were studied in 93 non-operated non-diabetic patients with intermittent claudication. Independent variables affecting the ankle/arm BP index (ABI) in the more affected leg were the initial ABI, smoking, duration of claudication and location of the stenoses (whether single or multiple). ABI was stable in non-smokers but decreased in smokers. It also decreased in patients with multiple stenoses at the initial examination but not in those with single stenoses. The correlation between subjective changes in claudication and changes in the ankle BP was poor. In the less affected leg, ABI decreased both in smokers and non-smokers but stenoses in legs without signs of stenoses initially developed to a greater extent in smokers than in non-smokers. Smoking is an important risk factor for progression of the occlusive atherosclerotic disease in intermittent claudication. Patients with multiple stenoses seem to have a more progressive occlusive disease.
