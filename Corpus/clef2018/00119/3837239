Variability of arterial blood pressure readings in children following repeated measurements. The procedures for measuring the blood pressure cause emotional reactions, which in turn influence, in a manner which is not to be disregarded, the blood pressure values. In order to evaluate the degree and type of such influence the blood pressure was determined for 3 consecutive days by the same doctor using the same technique in 242 children (150 boys and 92 girls) of a primary school in Bari. The systolic and diastolic values obtained allowed us to categorize the children in to 3 groups in accordance with their individual reactions on occasion of the second and third determination: a) children whose blood pressure went down b) children whose blood pressure went up
