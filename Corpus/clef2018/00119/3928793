Systolic pressure index at the ankle, a "beacon" of long-term monitoring of lower-limb arteriopathy. Data is provided to demonstrate the reliability of measuring the systolic pressure index (SPI) for surveillance of lower limb arteriopathy (mainly during postoperative follow-up), the aim being to establish a simple, rapid and reliable surveillance test of high decisional value. Reproducibility of SPI values was studied in two series of patients (personal and collective) and on variations of SPI before and after reconstructive arterial surgery, as well as in cases of arterial bypass degradation. The following threshold values, beacon of the surveillance, were retained: --variations of 15% in relation to a reference examination: non-significant, --variations of 20 to 30%: probably significant, --variations of more than 30%: significant. A drop of 30% or more of the SPI in relation to a postoperative reference value during surveillance after reconstructive arterial surgery suggests the need for a follow-up angiography to detect possible lesions that could affect bypass permeability, whatever the patient's symptomatology.
