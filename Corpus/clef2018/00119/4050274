Correlation of angiographically determined reduction of vascular lumen with lower-limb systolic pressures. Angiographically determined reduction of vascular lumen was correlated with lower-limb systolic pressure ratios in a series of 62 patients with intermittent claudication or suspected aneurysmal or vasospastic disease of the lower limbs. Statistically highly significant, though not particularly close, correlations were observed between the angiographic findings and the thigh-arm, calf-arm and ankle-arm pressure ratios (r = -0.732, -0.711 and -0.731, respectively). A mathematical model of the type employed in this study seems to be useful for correlating angiographic findings with systolic pressures in the lower limbs.
