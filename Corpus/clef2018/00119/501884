Treatment of vein graft stenosis by balloon catheter dilation. Percutaneous balloon catheter dilation was used to treate 12 high-grade stenoses in ten autogenous vein bypass grafts since September 1978. Four lesions occurred in femoropopliteal grafts, seven in femorotibal grafts, seven in femorotibial grafts, and one in an axillofemoral graft. Balloon catheter dilation was successful and surgery avoided in 11 of the 12 lesions. Pedal pulses were restored in eight of the ten patients, and the pulse in a femorotibial bypass graft was improved in another. Postdilation arteriography demonstrated a substantial increase in luminal diameter, and ankle pressure indexes were improved in all successful cases. The tenth had an operative correction of the stenosis. There were no complications with the procedure. Percutaneous balloon catheter dilation appears to be an effective method of treating stenosis in autogenous vein grafts and a useful alternative to surgical revision.
