Noninvasive determination of carotid artery operability by Doppler ultrasound. Indirect periorbital screening techniques may detect obstruction of the extracranial internal carotid artery, but they do not distinguish operable stenosis from inoperable occlusion. In an attempt to overcome this limitation, direct interrogation of carotid artery flow velocity by Doppler ultrasound was added to periorbital screening of 97 arteries in 53 patients. Analysis of results suggests that this assessment can improve diagnostic accuracy and distinguish stenosis from occlusion of the internal carotid arteries in stroke-prone patients.
