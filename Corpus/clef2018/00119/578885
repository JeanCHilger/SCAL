Cooperative study of hospital frequency and character of transient ischemic attacks. VI. Patients examined during an attack. Examination during an episode of transient ischemic attack (TIA) was performed on 121 of 1,307 patients suspected of having a single type of TIA. This examination supported the diagnosis of TIA in 79 patients and contributed to the establishment of a diagnosis other than TIA in 42. Although the examination increased diagnostic reliability, it did not always result in a definite diagnosis. The most common neurologic findings during a TIA were weakness of an arm or side of the face. Important findings not suggested by history included visual defects and blood pressure fluctuation. Also unexpected were the absence of findings such as sensory deficits in the presence of sensory complaints, retinal emboli, and cardiac abnormalities. Severe arteriosclerotic disease was less evident, the attacks were longer and more severe, and monocular blindness was rare.
