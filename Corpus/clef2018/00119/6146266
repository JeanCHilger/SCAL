Effects of beta-blockade on regional myocardial flow and function during exercise. We examined the effects of a cardioselective beta-blocking drug on exercise-induced regional myocardial ischemia in 10 conscious dogs with chronic coronary artery stenosis. An ameroid constrictor, Doppler flowprobe, and hydraulic cuff were placed around the left circumflex coronary artery, and left ventricular pressure (LVP), systolic wall thickening (% delta WT by sonomicrometry), and myocardial blood flow (MBF
