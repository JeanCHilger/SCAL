Prevalence of disease of the large arteries in an elderly Belgian population: relationship with some metabolic factors. We measured the ankle pressure ratio (IPs) with the Doppler in a series of 261 subjects, mean age 80.6 +/- 5.3 years. The values of IPs has been distributed in three groups: IPs less than 0.9 related to an obstructive peripheral arterial disease, 2 greater than IPs greater than 0.9 patient with normal arteries, and IPs greater than 2 which corresponds with an arterial incompressibility. The ratio (formula see text) so called "atherogenic index" was calculated in the three groups and related to the IPs. Forty five percent of the subjects have an abnormal IPs
