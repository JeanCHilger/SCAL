Assessment of chronic venous insufficiency using dynamic venous pressure studies. In this study, 207 consecutive limbs with chronic venous insufficiency were evaluated with dynamic venous pressure studies and they were correlated with the clinical presentation and results of definitive radiologic studies with ascending and descending venography. Multiple methods of performing the pressure studies, by active exercise, passive manual compression, and tourniquet application at the calf and ankle, proved useful in distinguishing the severity and location of venous disease. The limits of confidence that can be ascribed to the dynamic venous pressure studies were also determined.
