Intraoperative assessment of arterial reconstruction by Doppler ultrasound. The Doppler ultrasonic velocity detector is a simple, inexpensive and versatile device for intraoperative monitoring of the integrity and hemodynamics result of vascular reconstructive surgical procedures. With this instrument, an ankle-arm systolic pressure index may be obtained before and after aortoiliac and femoral reconstructive surgical procedures. If the ankle pressure index does not increase following aortofemoral bypass and a thromboembolic vascular accident has been ruled out, it is unlikely that the patient will be significantly helped by that procedure alone. The use of a sterile Doppler probe permits qualitative assessment of arterial velocity signals following femoropopliteal bypass, carotid endarterectomy and mesenteric or renal vascular procedures. The Doppler detector may also be used to assess periorbital flow dynamics following carotid endarterectomy. Selective intraoperative arteriography can be based upon the presence of residual flow abnormalities detected by Doppler ultrasound.
