Skin perfusion pressure measured by isotope washout in legs with arterial occlusive disease. Evaluation of different tracers, comparison to segmental systolic pressure, angiography and transcutaneous oxygen tension and variations during changes in systemic blood pressure. The skin perfusion pressure (SPP) measured as the isotope washout cessation external pressure is valuable in selection of major amputation level. Five methodological investigations important to clinical use were carried out: (1) In five normal legs and 10 legs with arterial occlusive disease (AOD), 131I- -antipyrine (131I- -a.p.) was compared to Na(131I-) and 99Tcm-pertechnetate (99Tcm). The average SPP by 131I- -a.p. and by 131I- were approximately equal, 57.0 mmHg (range 18-93) compared to 56.3 mmHg (range 13-88) (P greater than 0.1). The average SPP by 99Tcm was just slightly higher, 60.3 mmHg (range 18-98) (P less than 0.02). The average washout constant for the three different tracers were approximately equal and correlated statistically significant with the SPP (2) In 59 legs with AOD, segmental SPP was compared to segmental systolic blood pressures on the thigh, calf, ankle and first digit (strain gauge technique). The two different methods correlated statistically significant at all four levels, but the systolic blood pressures were higher than the SPP in particular in diabetic legs
