Spasmodic torticollis as a cause of ulnar nerve entrapment. Spasmodic torticollis is thought to be a central nervous system disorder with no peripheral nervous system component. Several consecutive patients with spastic torticollis were found to have ulnar nerve compromise at the elbow on the side ipsilateral to the direction of chin turning. This article describes three such patients in detail. It is postulated that the cause is the stereotypical posture assumed by these patients in using their hand to maintain a neutral head position. The chronic leaning and elbow flexion place the ulnar nerve at risk for the development of pressure neuropathy.
