Ultrasound screening for internal carotid disease-I. The temporal artery occlusion test--which periorbital artery? Using continuous wave Doppler-shifted ultrasound and spectral analysis the response to the temporal artery occlusion test was compared when insonating the supraorbital and supratrochlear arteries of 203 internal carotid pathways. The test involved monitoring the periorbital artery whilst simultaneously compressing a single branch of the external carotid artery, the ipsilateral superficial temporal artery. In 41 instances carotid angiography demonstrated severe disease of the internal carotid artery, that is lesions of 75% or more reduction in lumen diameter. A positive response to the temporal artery occlusion test, when performed on the supraorbital artery, indicated severe disease with a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 89%. When this test was performed on the supratrochlear artery a low sensitivity of 36% was obtained, although specificity was high at 96%.
