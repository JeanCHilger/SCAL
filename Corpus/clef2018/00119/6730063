Ultrasound screening for internal carotid disease-II. Sensitivity and specificity of a single site periorbital artery test. Supraorbital artery blood flow was examined non-invasively with continuous wave Doppler-shifted ultrasound and spectral analysis. The results were used to assess the ipsilateral internal carotid artery in 155 patients undergoing carotid angiography. The ultrasound parameters used were the temporal artery occlusion test and A/B ratios of both resting and augmented supraorbital sonagrams. A retrospective study showed this combination to have a sensitivity of 65% for internal carotid disease which did not encroach on the lumen and for all other angiographically demonstrated lesions an average sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 92%. Augmented supraorbital pulses were more sensitive for detection of carotid artery disease than resting supraorbital pulses. Of the 61 lesions in which both resting and augmented supraorbital A/B ratios were obtained, the augmented supraorbital pulse detected 48 (79%) whilst the resting supraorbital pulse detected 29 (48%). Localised carotid bruits were poor indicators of carotid artery disease, having a sensitivity of only 27%.
