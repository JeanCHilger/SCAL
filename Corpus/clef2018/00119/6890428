Reference values for intramuscular pressure in the lower leg in man. Intramuscular pressures in the anterior tibial and superficial posterior compartments of the lower leg were measured by the wick catheter technique in 34 healthy individuals (17 males and 17 females, mean age 42 years). The pressures were measured at rest, during and after exercise and during venous and arterial occlusion. The pressure was 1.1 (range 0.3-3.0) kPa in the anterior tibial and 0.5 (range 0.0-2.0) kPa in the superficial posterior compartment at rest. During exercise the intramuscular pressures rose to 3.5 (range 1.0-8.0) kPa and 0.9 (range 0.1-2.8) kPa respectively. The anterior tibial compartment pressures were lower in females than in males at exercise and lower in older than in younger persons at rest. After exercise the pressures were back to the pre-exercise levels within 5 min. Venous occlusion caused an increase in the pressure which was more marked in the anterior tibial compartment than in the superficial posterior compartment. Arterial occlusion did not cause any dramatic changes in intramuscular pressures, but there was a slight elevation during the period of reactive hyperaemia.
