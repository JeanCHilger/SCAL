Importance and indications for Doppler ultrasonic diagnosis in chronic venous insufficiency. Ultrasonic Doppler-technique is a non-invasive, low-cost method to answer some questions regarding venous flow of leg and pelvis in chronic venous insufficiency. Findings can be evaluated immediately. In the diagnosis of a deep venous obstruction in the lower extremity the reliability of the method decreases from proximal to distal. Compared with X-ray or isotopic phlebography the Doppler-technique gives the most accurate results in the examination of pelvic vein flow. The assessment of vein flow is less reliable in the thigh and particularly in the calf. Doppler-technique is also helpful for the detection of incompetent perforator veins of the leg. The results compete with those of phlebography. Systolic blood pressure measurement at the ankle by Doppler-technique is a simple procedure of high value for diagnosing an arterial obstruction of the lower limb.
