Doppler hemodynamic assessment of obscure symptomatology in the upper extremity. Thirty-eight patients were studied because of symptoms thought to be vascular in origin. In 18 patients in whom angiography was performed, the presence or absence of hemodynamically significant vascular occlusive lesions was predicted correctly by Doppler ultrasound techniques. Normal Doppler studies in the remaining 20 patients expedited nonvascular diagnostic evaluation and treatment and helped to avoid unnecessary angiography. Studies required 15 to 20 minutes and no complications occurred. Noninvasive Doppler evaluation is inexpensive, free of risk, and provides an accurate means of determining alterations in upper extremety hemodynamics.
