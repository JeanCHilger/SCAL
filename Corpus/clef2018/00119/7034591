Comparative evaluation of the effectiveness of buflomedil and pentoxifylline in patients with arterial occlusive disease. A double-blind study was performed on 40 physically trained patients with stage II peripheral arterial insufficiency. Daily doses of 450 mg buflomedil were administered for 90 days and eventual improvements were compared to the effects of pentoxifylline given in daily doses of 300 mg. After treatment with buflomedil and also with pentoxifylline, significant increases were achieved in walking distances during these tests, the increase was not significant. Nor uniform findings were noted in oscillograms and in ultrasonic Doppler investigations.
