Contribution of Doppler investigations of the deep venous axes to the prevention and diagnosis of thrombo-embolic disease (author's transl). The venous disease study by Doppler ultrasound technique provides a precious help to its diagnosis because the dubiousness and limits of clinical examination. The main indications of Doppler ultrasound deep veins examination are: --early diagnosis of thrombophlebitis, venous insufficiency and arterio-venous fistulae. --a non invasive monitoring of medical or surgical treatment of venous pathology and best appreciation of venous return in right heart cardiopathies, respiratory disease and abdominal surgery. --help in central venous catheterization. The sensibility of Doppler ultrasound in venous thrombosis is 86.5% and its specificity 91% in a study of 110 patients with comparison Doppler-venography. These results quite comparable with other studies, indicate a poor sensibility for the diagnosis of distal thrombi or partially occluding clots. In association with other non invasive examination Doppler ultrasound allows a better indication of phlebography in the detection of thrombophlebitis in high risk patients as well as a post operative survey with high sensitivity and good efficiency.
