Ultrasonic Doppler methods of blood flow studies of the arterial circulation from the aorta up to the kidney parenchyma in animals. The Doppler method of ultrasonography was used in experimental investigations to examine the circulator behaviour at various points in the arterial system in the retroperitoneum as fast as the kidney in animals with normal circulation. This enabled reproducible Doppler curves to be determined. It remains to be seen to what extent characteristic curve patterns exist for e.g. partial or subtotal vascular occlusion. For the future it will be especially important to determine the flow curves in the cortical region of the renal parenchyma as an area of small and very small vessels, for this can give us important information on the circulation of blood in the individual segments of the kidney.
