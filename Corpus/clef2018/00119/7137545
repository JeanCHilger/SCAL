Cannulation of the axillary artery in continuous blood pressure monitoring and blood gas analysis. Catheterisation of the axillar artery for the control of blood pressure and blood gases is described. The advantages over puncturing of small arteries consist in the lower risk of thromboembolic complications and the greater accuracy in blood pressure measurement. Compared with the a. femoralis, the a. axillaris offers the advantages of better intraoperative accessibility, lower risk of contamination and better mobility of the patient. Out of 120 patients who received an a. axillaris catheter preoperatively or in the intensive-care ward for control purposes, complications occurred in 12 cases (haematomas after decannulation, disturbed sensitivity, thrombus at the vascular wall, kinking and obstruction of the catheter), which, however, did not give rise to any clinical sequels.
