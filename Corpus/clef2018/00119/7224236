Influence of non-selective and selective beta adrenoceptor blockade on isoxsuprine-dependent hemodynamic and rheologic changes. The infusion of isoxsuprine was followed by an increase of heart rate and calf blood flow and by a decrease of arterial diastolic pressure and blood viscosity both in normal controls and patients with peripheral obstructive arterial disease. The pre-treatment with a non-selective beta adrenoceptor blocker (propranolol) canceled all the isoxsuprine-dependent changes, while the pre-treatment with a selective beta adrenoceptor blocker (metoprolol) abolished only tachycardia and did not influence the increase of calf blood flow and the decrease of blood viscosity. These findings indicate the different role of vascular beta receptors in the regulation of muscular blood flow and suggest the pharmacologic possibility to unmask the beta2-dependent vasodilation.
