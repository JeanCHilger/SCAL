Surgical management of chronic occlusive disease of the aortic arch vessels and vertebral arteries. Occlusive disease of the aortic arch vessels is relatively rare and often missed initially. Of 41 patients treated surgically for this condition over a 10-year period 38 had arteriosclerotic lesions, 2 had symptoms secondary to vasculitis (Takayasu's arteritis) and 1 had a radiation injury to a subclavian artery. In 22 cases the left subclavian artery was involved the right subclavian and innominate arteries were the next most commonly affected. Only four vertebral stenoses were treated. Most patients presented with a combination of arm and hindbrain ischemia that was shown radiologically to be associated with a subclavian steal syndrome, but in some only isolated arm symptoms or severe vertigo alone was experienced. There was a difference in blood pressure between the arms of at least 20 mm Hg in 88% of the patients. The treatment for 28 patients was creation of a carotid-subclavian bypass, for 6 the placement of a bypass graft from the ascending aorta to the subclavian or carotid artery or both, for a 3 a subclavian endarterectomy and for 4 vertebral angioplasty. There were no operative deaths, and 90% of the grafts were patent 1 to 72 months later. however, only 30 (73%) of the patients were asymptomatic and 9 (22%) had improved.
