Clinical-angiographic correlation of ophthalmodynamometry in suspected carotid artery disease. Prospective study. A prospective, clinical study of patients with suspected carotid artery disease compared the accuracy of compression and suction ophthalmodynamometry (ODM) with carotid artery stenosis determined by arteriography. Results were analyzed with respect to current criteria for classification and determination of "substantial" carotid artery disease. The best correlation for both procedures with arteriography was a ratio of the corrected intraocular pressure to the systolic brachial pressure. Both suction and compression ODM findings are equally accurate, with levels approaching 80% however, neither test is sensitive enough to be used alone as a screening technique. Arteriography remains the best procedure for the determination of carotid artery disease.
