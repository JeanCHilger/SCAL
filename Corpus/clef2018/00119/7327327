Correlations between clinical stage and peripheral pressures in peripheral vascular diseases (author's transl). The authors have studied 311 patients with arterial occlusive disease of the lower limbs. They have taken the arm pressure and the ankle pressure (A.P.) and have calculated the ankle/arm pressure index of Winsor (I.W.) in order to ascertain a relationship between peripheral pressure and clinical stage. The result is that both I.W. and A.P. are equally valuable to depict the different stages of the arterial occlusive disease.
