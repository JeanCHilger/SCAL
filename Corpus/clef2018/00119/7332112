Comparative study of strain gauge plethysmography and Doppler ultrasound in patients with occlusive arterial disease of the lower extremities. A series of 305 normal subjects and 77 patients with angiographically proven stenotic or occlusive arterial disease of the lower limbs was studied with Doppler ultrasound pressure measurements and strain gauge plethysmographic arterial flow measurements. The 2 techniques were compared singly and in combination at rest and after exercise or reactive hyperemia. Pressure-flow patterns were found to correlate well with the segment(s) and extent of involvement with arterial disease, especially  in patients with superficial femoral artery disease. However, it was found that calf blood flow measurements were of little assistance in predicting the level and severity of involvement over and above the information obtained by pressure measurements alone.
