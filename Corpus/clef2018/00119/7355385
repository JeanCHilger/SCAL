The effect of superficial femoral artery occlusion on the outcome of aortofemoral bypass for intermittent claudication. This study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of untreated superficial femoral artery occlusion in patients undergoing aortofemoral bypass for intermittent claudication. In 56 patients at a mean follow-up time of 3.3 years, graft patency, treadmill walking tolerance, and ankle systolic pressure indices (ASPI) were compared in two groups of limbs: those with a patent superficial femoral artery and those with that vessel occluded. There was a high graft patency rate with no significant difference between the two groups. In limbs with a patent superficial femoral artery, 86% were completely relieved of claudication. However, in limbs with an occluded superficial femoral artery, only 26% were relieved of claudication. In limbs with a patent superficial femoral artery, the mean postoperative ASPI was 0.87 (SE +/- 0.22) compared with 0.61 (SD +/- 0.17) in limbs with an occluded superficial femoral artery. These results indicate that, in patients with combined superficial femoral artery occlusion and aortoiliac disease, revascularizing the deep femoral artery by aortofemoral grafting often does not achieve relief of claudication. There is a need for more effective hemodynamic discrimination of the relative contribution of proximal and distal occlusions.
