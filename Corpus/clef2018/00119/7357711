Development of a bladder-free cuff for measuring the blood pressure of the fingers and toes. In the present study, we investigated the technique and reliability of measuring digital blood pressure by means of a rigid, airtight container (a bladder-free cuff) and a photocell placed on the digit. As cuff pressure increased, the position of digits in the cuff was maintained in the hand by fixing one or two fingers inside the cuff and, in the foot, by using a supporting stick to keep the distance from the cuff to the bed constant. An airtight seal inside the cuff was achieved using a thin rubber sleeve and adhesive tape. Blood pressures determined by the bladder-free cuff correlated well with those obtained by the conventional cuff with bladder. By using the bladder-free cuff, blood pressure could be measured at the distal phalanx of the fingers and in all toes.
