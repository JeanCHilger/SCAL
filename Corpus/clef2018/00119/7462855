Investigation and surgical treatment of vasculogenic impotency (author's transl). Vasculogenic impotency does exist. Series of 45 operated cases with at least 6 month follow up give the main points of diagnosis and surgical new methods. Organic impotency is assessed by permanent leakage of morning erection, and monitoring of nocturnal penile tumescence (P.E.N.). Arterial insufficiency is present when penile pressure index (I.P.P.) is below 0,95 and Doppler penile notation up to 5 (N.D.P.). Selective hypogastric arteriography shows the site and importance of lesions. Venous incompetence is explored by cavernosography and passive erection output studies. 45 patients experienced 54 vascular procedures with 60% good results at 6 months.
