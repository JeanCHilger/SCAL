Noninvasive methods in the early detection of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in peripheral arteries. In a prospective study, several noninvasive methods were evaluated in the early detection of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in peripheral arteries. Sensitivity and specificity of various noninvasive resting and exercise methods for the detection of restenosis were determined. It is concluded that noninvasive follow-up after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in peripheral arteries requires exercise testing with determination of ankle-arm index or segmental arterial pulse oscillography for the early detection of restenosis.
