Clinical and ultrasonic validation for the intracavernous use of papaverin hydrochloride for the test screening of patients with arterial erectile impotence. Intracavernous administration of 2% papaverine hydrochloride solution, 4 ml, was conducted in 25 patients with various arterial erectile impotence and 25 patients with psychogenic impotence. The efficiency of the solution was judged from clinical findings and results of penile blood flow estimation via ultrasonic Doppler graphy 10 minutes after injection. Ultrasonic Doppler graphy involved calculation of the pulse wave acceleration measure and penile-brachial index of acceleration. In patients with psychogenic impotence the penile blood flow after intracavernous papaverine hydrochloride assumed the features of great blood flow, whereas it remained reduced in patients with arterial erectile impotence. In Doppler sonography, basic parameters were determined, viz assessment of the form of a Doppler wave, initial blood flow velocity, maximum blood flow velocity and their difference.
