Neurolytic block of the lumbar sympathetic trunk in advanced stages of peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Neurolytic blocks of the lumbar sympathetic trunk enable a less invasive sympathetic denervation if compared to standard surgical procedures.34 patients undergoing chemical lumbar sympathectomy (CLS) for advanced arterial occlusive disease were prospectively studied. An actual indication for reconstructive vascular surgical intervention had been excluded in all patients. The sympatholytic efficacy, different haemodynamic variables, the relief of rest pain and the effect on ischaemic ulcers were quantified before, 3 and 21 days after CLS.The mean intensity of rest pain, as assessed on a visual analogue scale (0-100 mm), significantly decreased from 60 mm to 31 and 34 mm, respectively. 9 of 12 patients with ischaemic ulcers showed partial or complete remission within the study period. Overall, in 88% of patients sympathetic denervation could be demonstrated by ablation of the sympatho-galvanic skin response. The mean difference in skin temperature between the treated and the untreated leg significantly increased from -0.73 degrees C to +0.34 and +0.39 degrees C, respectively. Doppler-sonographic measurements of the ankle-pressure-index showed a minor increase from 0.34 to 0.36 and 0.42 however, these changes did not reach significance. Neither changes of the different physiologic variables nor data of the patient history could predict the relief of rest pain after CLS. The only side effect of CLS was transient neuralgia of the genitofemoral nerve occurring in 19% of patients.Considering the relatively short follow-up period, the results of this study support evidence of the therapeutic efficacy of CLS for rest pain and ischaemic ulcers in patients with advanced arterial disease. The prognostic value of standard variables for estimation of sympathetic reactivity and skin blood flow, however, could not be confirmed.
