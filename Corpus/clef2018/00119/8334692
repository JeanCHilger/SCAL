External iliac vein stenosis after segmental pancreatic transplantation: treatment by percutaneous endoprosthesis. A stenosis of the iliac vein secondary to a fluid collection in a pancreas transplant was identified by color Doppler flow sonography. The pancreatic venous drainage was reversed to the contralateral iliac veins via venous collaterals. After two unsuccessful angioplasties of the vein stenosis, a Wallstent was positioned above the venous anastomosis, and has remained patent for 8 months. The pancreatic venous drainage became normal after the procedure.
