Noninvasive assessment of collateral blood flow of the cerebral hemisphere by Doppler ultrasound. Directional flow in the frontal artery, a terminal branch of the ophthalmic artery, was assessed nonivasively by Doppler ultrasound druing brief digital compression of the ipsilateral common carotid artery in 62 patients. Directional frontal artery flow during carotid compression was compared with mean distal internal carotid back pressure measured at subsequent carotid endarterectomy. Mean carotid back pressure in 28 patients with normal frontal artery flow direction during carotid compression, 68 +/- 14 millimeters of mercury, was significantly higher than that observed in 24 patients in whom frontal artery flow was completely obliterated and ten in whom frontal artery flow was reversed. Distal internal carotid back pressure exceeded 48 millimeters of mercury in all patients with normal frontal artery flow direction during carotid compression. Conversely, carotid back pressure was below 41 millimeters of mercury in all but one patient in whom frontal artery flow was obliterated or bliterated or reversed during carotid compression. The results of this study indicate that Doppler ultrasound assessment of frontal artery flow direction during simultaneous carotid compression provides a rapid, sale noninvasive estimate of the adequacy of collateral hemispheric circulation.
