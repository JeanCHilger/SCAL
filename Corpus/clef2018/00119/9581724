Effect of high dose verapamil on restenosis after peripheral angioplasty. We sought to determine whether treatment with high dose verapamil prevents restenosis in patients at high risk for reoccurrence after successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA).Restenosis is the major limitation of PTCA. Calcium antagonists have demonstrated some potential as inhibitors of this process.A total of 98 patients with peripheral occlusive arterial disease (POAD), stable angina pectoris, mild hypertension and at least one additional risk factor increasing the likelihood of restenosis after angioplasty were selected for this placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial. Verapamil (240 mg twice daily) or placebo was taken for 6 months. Efficacy variables assessed before and after angioplasty and at 6 weeks and 6 months after PTCA included thickness of the intima/media complex degree of stenosis, interventricular septal thickness, crurobrachial pressure ratios of dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries, distance to claudication and total vessel diameter.No significant intergroup differences emerged before or immediately after PTCA. Six weeks after angioplasty, a significant thickening of the intima/media complex in the treated vascular segment of 14.3% occurred in the placebo group versus 0% among verapamil patients (p < 0.01). At 6 months, the intima/media thickness was 35.7% greater in the placebo group but had decreased by 14.3% in the verapamil group (p < 0.001). At 6 months, a marked reduction in septal thickness was observed in the verapamil group versus that in the placebo group (p < 0.001). The rate of restenosis was also significantly lower in the verapamil group (p < 0.001). Few minor side effects were reported.In patients with POAD at increased risk for restenosis, the administration of high dose verapamil prevented recurrent stenosis for 6 months after successful peripheral angioplasty and was well tolerated.
