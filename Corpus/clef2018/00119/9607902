The clinical significance of performing preoperative angiography of the internal thoracic artery in coronary artery bypass surgery. This study was designed to clarify the clinical significance of and indications for performing preoperative internal thoracic artery (ITA) angiography in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. A total of 300 possible candidates for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) underwent ITA angiography during diagnostic catheterization. Semi-selective angiography of bilateral ITAs were performed by injecting contrast medium manually with a 5-F right Judkins coronary catheter. The posteroanterior view of the arteriograms was recorded on a 35-mm cine film or a cut-film. Unusual angiographic findings of the ITAs were observed in nine patients (3%). These findings included: an atrophic ITA in three patients with ipsilateral subclavian artery occlusions enlarged ITAs giving collaterals to the lower extremities in one patient with extensive aortoiliac occlusive disease
