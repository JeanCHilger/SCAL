A comparison of laser Doppler fluxmetry and transcutaneous oxygen pressure measurement in the dysvascular patient requiring amputation. To determine the predictive power of laser Doppler fluxmetry (LDF), both heated and unheated, as a preoperative investigation of wound healing potential in dysvascular patients requiring amputation, by comparison with transcutaneous oxygen pressure measurement (TcpO2) and the limb to chest TcpO2 index.Thirty-five non-diabetic patients with peripheral vascular disease were investigated before amputation. Heated and unheated LDF and heated TcpO2 measurements were taken on the chest wall and at the routine above-knee, below-knee and mid-foot amputation levels. Wound healing potential was evaluated against a TcpO2 index value of 0.55 and on clinical outcome.A heated LDF value of 4.9 arbitrary units (au) was shown by receiver-operator characteristic curve to have the best predictive power, with an overall accuracy for preoperative prediction of wound healing of 91.4%, and a predictive value for wound failure of 89%. Based on the heated LDF of 4.9 au, review of 26 amputations performed shows the overall accuracy for preoperative prediction of wound healing of 92.3%, a predictive value for wound healing of 100%, and a predictive value for wound failure of 62.5%.A heated LDF value of 4.9 au appears to be a useful predictor of the potential of an amputation site to heal.
