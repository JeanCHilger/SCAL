Color doppler ultrasonography in peripheral artery occlusive disease: continuous application of a signal enhancer. The effect of continuous infusion of a signal enhancer on the diagnostic efficacy of Doppler ultrasound in peripheral artery disease was evaluated.35 patients with peripheral artery disease were investigated by Doppler ultrasound before and during infusion of a signal enhancer (Levovist). Femoral and popliteal arteries were examined. Angiographic diagnoses included occlusions (24) and stenoses (22). They were compared to plain and enhanced Doppler findings. Artefacts and effects on signal intensity were evaluated.An increased Doppler signal was observed starting 1 min 35 s (mean) after begin of the infusion. It persisted for 11 min 46 s (mean). Signal enhanced studies provided less over- (0/1) and underestimation (3/5) of the findings and evaluation in the adductor channel was less compromised. Signal enhanced studies highlighted collaterals.Doppler ultrasound in patients with peripheral arterial disease is improved by continuous application of a signal enhancer.
