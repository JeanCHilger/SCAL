The hemodynamic characteristics of the central retinal artery and ophthalmic artery in atherosclerotic lesions of the carotid arteries based on the data from ultrasonic study methods. Central retinal artery and orbital artery were examined by ultrasonograph in 348 patients with atherosclerosis of the carotid arteries. Doppler shift of frequency spectrum was detected in the central retinal artery, which is typical of the ischemic syndrome of the eye. Its characteristics include decreased diastolic component of velocity and increased resistance index. The possibility of using duplex scanning with color Doppler flow mapping for assessing the treatment efficacy is demonstrated. A direct relationship between the degree of stenosis in the internal carotid artery and blood flow in the orbital artery is revealed. The detected changes do not notably affect the Doppler spectrum characteristics in the central retinal artery.
