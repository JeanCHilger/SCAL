The role of profundaplasty in revascularization of the lower extremity. Profundaplasty has been performed on 112 limbs (88 primary and 24 secondary) in eighty-five men. Seventy-six limbs had incapacitating claudication, twenty-three rest pain, and thirteen either gangrene or ischemic ulceration. In thirty-six limbs treated by profundaplasty alone there were no deaths but five subsequently had amputation for ischemic pain. In the seventy-six limbs treated by profundaplasty plus other operative augmentation there were three operative deaths and one late death three required further operative surgery and in four amputation was necessary. Oblique arteriographic films of the femoral area are essential for evaluation of the profunda femoris artery. Both radionuclide and Doppler pressure studies confirmed physical and arteriographic findings. The latter would appear superior because of ease of availability and cost. After profundaplasty alone and aortofemoral bypass there was a moderate increase in calf blood flow, but in only those with a patent superficial femoral artery did blood flow and pressure studies return to within normal limits. Profundaplasty is an important addition to the armamentarium of the vascular surgeon in dealing with arteriosclerotic insufficiency of the lower extremities.
