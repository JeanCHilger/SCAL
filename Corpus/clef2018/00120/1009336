Pulsatile changes of electrical impedance in the lower limb. The ratio of the pulsatile and the mean value of the volume of blood flowing through the calves of normal subjects with each heart beat was calculated from electrical impedance changes during venous occlusion plethysmography. Measurements made concurrently by proven Doppler ultrasound techniques did not correlate with ratios derived from the impedance measurements. The pulsatile change in electrical impedance in the limbs appears to be due more to changes of resistance in the blood than to pulsatile changes in the volume of the limb.
