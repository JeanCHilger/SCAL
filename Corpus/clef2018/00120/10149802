Initial results of laser angioplasty under angioscopic guidance for salvage of an ischemic lower limb:  preliminary report. From March to July 1989, nine patients at risk for peripheral artery disease underwent intraoperative Nd:YAG laser angioplasty using angioscopy at the Veterans General Hospital (Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China). Following the laser angioplasty, balloon dilatation was performed in all cases.  Eight men and one woman at an average age of 68 were included in the study (range:  58 to 78 years old).  Ischemic symptoms included five patients with disabling claudication, four with pain at rest and one with gangrene on the toes.  Eight of the nine patients had complete occlusions ranging from 2 to 19 cm in length.  Two patients had high degree multiple segmental stenosis of the superficial femoral artery from 1 to 2 cm in length.  Initial clinical success (indicated by relief of symptoms and increase in Doppler ankle pressure and index) and improvement in the angiographic luminal diameter was noted in 9 of 10 occluded vessels (90%) that underwent Nd:YAG laser treatment which was delivered at 10 to 12 watts through laser probes.  Prelaser intraluminal diameter increased from 0.05 +/- 0.07 to 0.53 +/- 0.07 mm, Doppler ankle pressure index rose from 0.51 +/- 0.12 to 0.81 +/- 0.12, Doppler ankle pressure increased from 62.44 +/- 16.10 to 104 +/- 21.21 mmHg and the amplitude of pulse volume recorder at ankle level rose from 5.77 +/- 2.80 to 12.11 +/- 2.77 mm as compared with prelaser therapy (P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
