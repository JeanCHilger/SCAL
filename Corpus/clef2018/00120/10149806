Color velocity imaging:  introduction to a new ultrasound technology. Noninvasive ultrasound is the preferred methodology for the initial evaluation of carotid atherosclerosis.  Since the early use of continuous-wave Doppler to assess carotid artery flow velocity blindly, neurosonology has progressed through crude B-mode imaging, spectral analysis of the Doppler signal, and gray-scale duplex Doppler/B-mode imaging, to color-flow Doppler duplex imaging.  The latter allows color coding of Doppler data based on the velocity of blood flow.  The combination of color-flow Doppler with gray-scale B-mode imaging allows simultaneous visual display of anatomical and hemodynamic information.  Physical limitations of color-flow duplex Doppler imaging may affect the clinical utility of these techniques.  Problems with pulse repetition frequency, aliasing, resolution capability of the color data, and interpolation of data make some applications difficult.  Color velocity imaging uses the data contained in the gray-scale B-mode image scan lines to determine velocity of blood flow, and it offers potential advantages over conventional color-flow duplex Doppler for the assessment of carotid atherosclerosis and hemodynamics.  Initial comparison of spectral Doppler and color velocity imaging data suggests that the latter is an accurate method to assess blood flow velocity.  Understanding of the validity, utility, and prognostic advantages offered by color velocity imaging awaits careful prospective clinical trials.
