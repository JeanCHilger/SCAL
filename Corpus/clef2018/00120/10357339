Adding clonidine to lidocaine for intravenous regional anesthesia prevents tourniquet pain. Tourniquet pain often complicates the use of the pneumatic tourniquet during surgical procedures performed under IV regional anesthesia. Clonidine-containing local anesthetic solutions have better analgesic properties than plain solutions when used for spinal, epidural, or peripheral blocks. We tested the hypothesis that the addition of clonidine may improve the quality of IV regional anesthesia, especially tourniquet tolerance. Forty patients were allocated randomly in a double-blinded, randomized study to receive 40 mL of 0.5% lidocaine and either 1 mL of isotonic saline or clonidine (150 microg). A double-cuffed tourniquet was kept inflated until patients complained of pain, leading to release of the distal cuff. Pain at the tourniquet site, at the surgical site, and in the distal part of the arm was rated on a visual analog scale (VAS) and a verbal rating scale (VRS) every 15 min during tourniquet placement and every 15 min for 1 h after tourniquet deflation. Motor blockade, sedation, arterial pressure, and heart rate were also recorded. VAS and VRS scores were significantly lower in the clonidine group 30 and 45 min after tourniquet inflation. The tolerance for the distal tourniquet was also significantly longer in the clonidine group (median [range]: 22 [10-40] vs 10 [5-20] min P < 0.05)A 150-microg dose of clonidine added to lidocaine improved tourniquet tolerance during IV regional anesthesia.
