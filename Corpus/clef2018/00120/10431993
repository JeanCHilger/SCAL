The effect of cigarette smoking status on six-minute walk distance in patients with intermittent claudication. The purposes of the study were threefold: (1) to compare 6-minute walk performance as a measure of exercise tolerance among three different groups of peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) patients with intermittent claudication-current smokers, former smokers, and patients who have never smoked (2) to identify important covariates that might affect the relationship between smoking and exercise in the PAOD population
