G protein beta3 subunit 825T allele and enhanced coronary vasoconstriction on alpha(2)-adrenoceptor activation. Recently, alpha(2)-adrenoceptor activation was shown to play an important role in the vasoconstriction of normal coronary arteries, whereas in the presence of atherosclerosis, the activation of both alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-adrenoceptors reduces coronary blood flow in humans. alpha(2)-Adrenoceptors activate pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G proteins, whereas alpha(1)-adrenoceptors couple to PTX-insensitive G proteins. Thus, the 825T allele of the beta3 subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins, associated with enhanced PTX-sensitive G protein signaling, was expected to determine the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor-, but not the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor-, mediated reduction in coronary blood flow (CBF). Genotyping was performed on 48 individuals. Twelve of the 48 received the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine (MTX 5 mg IC), and 12 received the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist BHT 933 (BHT
