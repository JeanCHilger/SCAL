Scintigraphy diagnosis of renovascular hypertension in renal transplanted patients. Captopril renography (CR) has been shown to be a useful technique in the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension (RVH). This disease is a significant complication of the kidney transplanted patient so that early diagnosis would be extremely useful to preserve renal function and prevent graft loss. This work evaluates the role of CR, together with arteriography and doppler-ultrasound, in the diagnosis of RVH.A total of 19 transplanted patients with clinical suspicion of RVH underwent an isotopic study, a doppler-ultrasound study and an arteriography. Scintigraphy was performed 1 hour after a 50 mg dose of captopril, with oral hydration and i.v. administration of approximately 111 MBq of 99mTc-MAG3 and 20 mg of furosemide. If abnormal, a subsequent renography in baseline conditions was performed for comparison.Overall, 11 patients had renovascular hypertension. Sensitivity and specificity of CR were 91% and 80% respectively, 100% and 60% for US and 91% and 100% for arteriography. The CR yielded one false positive result and 2 false negatives cases: one with 50% stenosis and one polar artery stenosis. Six patients were successfully dilated or operated.CR seems to be a reliable diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension in kidney transplanted patients.
