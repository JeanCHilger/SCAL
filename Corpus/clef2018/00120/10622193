Sphygmomanometer-induced increases in forearm and hand volume. Swelling, or increased volume, secondary to venous congestion is thought to be a factor in some upper limb conditions. This study aimed to establish a safe, easily applied method of inducing a transitory increase in forearm and hand volume that could be used as a symptom provocation test for upper limb conditions. Using the principles of venous occlusion plethysmography, movement of blood volume into the forearm and hand of asymptomatic subjects was measured after occlusion with three different sphygmomanometer cuff pressures over four minutes. Increases of between 37 and 62 ml (2.5% and 4.1%) were achieved at pressures between diastolic pressure minus 30 mm Hg and diastolic pressure plus 5 mm Hg, with minimal reported side effects. These data demonstrate that a sphygmomanometer can be used to induce transitory fluid congestion of the forearm and hand.
