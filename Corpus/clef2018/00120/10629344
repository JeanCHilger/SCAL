Transcranial Doppler waveform blunting in severe extracranial carotid artery stenosis. To investigate the frequency of transcranial Doppler (TCD) waveform blunting in patients with severe (80-99%) symptomatic or asymptomatic extracranial carotid artery stenosis.Severe carotid artery stenosis has been identified as a risk factor for ischemic stroke. Blunted Doppler flow waveforms (reduced systolic flow velocity and pulsatility) of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) are inferred to reflect hemodynamic impairment, possibly indicating an increased risk of stroke.The 114 consecutive patients (mean age 72.4 years, SD 9.0 years 37% womenAmong symptomatic patients, 23 (50%) had completed strokes, and a further 23 (50%) had transient neurologic deficits in the territory of the stenotic ICA. Blunted spectral waveform was found in 37 (80%, 95% CI 68-92%) of the symptomatic and 25 (37% 95% CI 25-49%) of the asymptomatic patients. Symptomatic patients had significantly increased odds of having blunted TCD waveforms (OR 7.5, 95% CI 3.1-18.1, p < 0.001).Our findings suggest that TCD waveform blunting in the MCA as here described may be an additional risk factor in the setting of severe extracranial carotid artery stenosis. A prospectively designed study to confirm our results seems warranted.
