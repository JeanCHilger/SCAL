Assessment of arterial blood flow characteristics in normal and atherosclerotic vessels with the fast Fourier flow method. The purpose of this study was to scrutinize the ability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-performed measurements to compare arterial flow patterns in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD), healthy volunteers (HV) and endurance athletes (EA). MRI blood flow data were partially repeated with Doppler ultrasound (DUS) with a view to a methodical comparison. Additionally, pulse wave velocity was assessed with the MUFF technique. For this purpose, MRI-performed flow measurements were performed in the common femoral artery in 21 patients with PAOD, in 34 HV and in 12 EA. The analysis included maximum flow velocities (MFV), velocity/time profile (VTP), pulse wave velocity (Vpulse), and vessel diameter (VD). In addition, MFV and VD were observed by DUS in most individuals. The results revealed a significant change regarding arterial blood flow characteristics in patients compared with HV and EA, with respect to the span between the peak positive and negative blood flow velocity in the femoral artery. The pulse wave velocity in patients was markedly elevated compared with healthy individuals. Furthermore, a complete, characteristic change in the VTP could be observed in patients. The methodical comparison between DUS and MRI showed a good correlation. Multi-slice Fourier flow data have indicated markedly increased pulse wave velocity in PAOD patients. Changes in the arterial blood flow can be clearly observed with MRI. In the future, this might offer a noninvasive possibility not only for the evaluation of the stage of the disease, but also for the detection of early, pre-clinical stages of atherosclerosis.
