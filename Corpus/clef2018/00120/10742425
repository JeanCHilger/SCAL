The use of colorflow duplex scanning to detect significant renal artery stenosis. The purpose of this study was to review our institutional experience with colorflow duplex scanning in detecting significant renal artery stenosis and to validate the criteria used: renal artery peak systolic velocity (PSV) >/=200 cm/sec and renal-to-aortic peak systolic ratio (RAR) >/=3.5. The results of renal artery duplex and arteriography in 58 patients (107 kidneys) who underwent both exams were reviewed. Arteriography revealed 32 main renal arteries with >/=60% stenosis. The PSV criterion detected 29, for a sensitivity of 91%, specificity of 75%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 60%, negative predictive value (NPV) of 95%, and accuracy of 79%. Using RAR >/=3.5 provided a sensitivity of 72%, specificity of 92%, PPV of 79%, NPV of 88%, and accuracy of 86%. In a subset of 36 kidneys that had hilar scans, the criteria of acceleration time (AT) >/=100 cm/sec and index (AI) </=3.78 kHz/sec were evaluated. The AT and AI yielded sensitivity of 50% and 36%, specificity of 86% and 100%, PPV of 70% and 100%, NPV of 73% and 71%, and accuracy of 72% and 75%, respectively. Colorflow duplex scanning is clinically useful in screening for hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis. The renal artery PSV criterion is highly sensitive, with a high NPV that obviates the need for arteriography in most cases of a negative duplex. The criteria of RAR, AT, and AI are of less value.
