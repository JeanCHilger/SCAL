Inverse relation between aldosterone and venous capacitance in chronically treated congestive heart failure. The purpose of this study was to examine if there is a relation between the aldosterone escape phenomenon and venous capacitance of the upper and lower limbs in patients with long-term congestive heart failure (CHF) receiving chronic treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The study group consisted of 16 subjects with ischemic CHF in New York Heart Association functional class II (age 59 +/-2 years, ejection fraction 24+/-4%), stabilized under a constant drug regimen comprising furosemide, captopril 50 mg 3 times daily, and digoxin for at least 3 months. Thirteen apparently healthy volunteers, aged 50+/-4 years acted as controls. Forearm and calf venous capacitances were measured simultaneously by venous occlusion plethysmography using mercury-in-silastic strain gauges. The equilibration technique was used to derive venous capacitance from the recorded pressure-volume curves. Active renin, angiotensin II, and aldosterone levels were determined on venous blood samples obtained in the supine position. Angiotensin II (p<0.05) and aldosterone (p<0.01) were statistically significantly higher in patients with CHF under long-term ACE inhibition than in controls (aldosterone escape phenomenon). In CHF, forearm venous capacitance was 2.19+/-0.18 ml/100 ml calf venous capacitance was 2.83+/-0.27 ml/100 ml. Aldosterone significantly and inversely correlated with venous capacitance in both upper (r = -0.586
