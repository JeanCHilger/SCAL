Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia: hepatic lesions demonstrated with colour Doppler and power Doppler sonography. Visceral vascular abnormalities in patients with hereditary haemorrhagic teleangiectasia (HHT) include teleangiectasis, arteriovenous fistula (AVF), and aneurysms. Sonographic findings and colour Doppler ultrasound (CDU) features of HHT in the liver have been described in a few reports. Presented here is the CDU finding of liver with HHT involvement in two patients, aged 52 and 29 years, respectively. Power Doppler sonography was also performed in the first patient in whom both CDU and power Doppler sonography could demonstrate the abnormal vascular channels in the liver. In the second patient, aneurysms in the left hepatic lobe and of the splenic artery were noted. Angiography was performed in both patients and confirmed the abnormal vascular lesions demonstrated by CDU and/or power Doppler sonographic findings.
