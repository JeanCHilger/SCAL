Use of a modified oxygen microelectrode and laser-Doppler flowmetry to monitor changes in oxygen tension and microcirculation in a flap. Flap failure is a clinical problem in free tissue transfer, and there is no reliable device for monitoring the tissue. Differentiating between an arterial occlusion and venous congestion is also a problem. A study was undertaken to monitor viability in a pedicled groin flap and to compare two different monitoring methods. The oxygen tension in the flap, measured with a modified Clark-type microelectrode (tip diameter = 3 to 8 microm 90 percent response within 2.6 +/- 0.5 seconds), was compared with changes in blood flow in the flap, measured with a laser-Doppler probe. In 11 Sprague-Dawley rats, the changes in oxygen tension and blood flow in the pedicled groin flap were studied after clamping and subsequent reperfusion of the artery or vein. After occlusion of the artery to the flap, oxygen tension decreased to a stable value (i.e., the recording level remained unchanged for 30 seconds), from 19.7 +/- 1.8 to 0.3 +/- 0.1 mmHg, after 193 +/-25 seconds
