Reference ranges for two-dimensional echocardiographic examination of the fetal ductus arteriosus. To establish reference ranges for 2D-echocardiographic examination of the fetal ductus arteriosus and its relationship to the main pulmonary artery and the aorta.A prospective cross-sectional echocardiographic study was performed in 222 normal fetuses from 13 to 41 weeks of gestation using high resolution/color Doppler ultrasound equipment.Gestational age-specific reference ranges are given for the diameter of the pulmonary valve anulus, diameter of the ductus arteriosus at its beginning, middle, and end, ductal length, ductal diameter-to-pulmonary valve anulus diameter ratio, and the spatial relationship of the ductus arteriosus to the main pulmonary artery and to the aorta.The presented data derived from a study group of 222 normal fetuses provide in-vivo insights into the morphology of the ductus arteriosus and its relationship to the adjacent vessels. The reference ranges may be helpful in prenatal diagnosis of cardiac malformations and abnormalities of the ductus arteriosus, such as obstruction or aneurysm from 13 to 41 weeks of gestation.
