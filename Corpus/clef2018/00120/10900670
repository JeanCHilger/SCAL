Percutaneous reconstruction of a pelvic vascular occlusion using the "kissing-balloon" technique. A 43-year-old patient was admitted for severe claudication in his right leg, doppler ultrasound and angiography revealed an occluded right common iliac artery. Using the cross-over-approach from the contralateral side, it was possible to navigate a guide wire through the occlusion, and after passage with an excimer laser an ipsilateral retrograde puncture with placement of a sheath was performed. In order to protect the the aortoiliac bifurcation, a primary stent implantation of the occluded side was carried out using the kissing balloon technique. Afterwards three stents were placed. Subsequently the patient completely improved treadmill exercise test and duplex sonography showed good results.Using the kissing balloon technique, laser-assisted recanalisation of iliac artery occlusions even involving the aortoiliac bifurcation compare favorable to other more invasive treatments. A surgical procedure can thus be avoided.
