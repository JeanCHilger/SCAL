Effect of flow competition on internal thoracic artery graft: postoperative velocimetric and angiographic study. To assess the effects of competitive blood flow on internal thoracic artery grafts, we investigated postoperative flow velocity characteristics and angiographic findings of the grafts with various grades of native coronary artery stenosis.Fifty patients who had an internal thoracic artery graft to the left anterior descending artery underwent intravascular Doppler graft velocimetry during postoperative angiography. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to the grade of native coronary stenosis: group H (28 patients), 80% stenosis or greater group M (16 patients), 60% to 79% stenosisAverage peak velocity (group H, 27.1 +/- 8.6 cm/s group M, 16.9 +/- 3.9 cm/sCompetitive blood flow reduces internal thoracic artery graft flow and diameter according to the grade of the native coronary artery stenosis. These data suggest that grafting the internal thoracic artery to the coronary artery with stenosis of a low grade can cause graft atrophy and failure.
