Hemodynamic changes in apolipoprotein E-knockout mice. Apolipoprotein E-knockout (ApoE-KO) mice develop advanced atherosclerotic lesions by 1 yr of age and have been well characterized pathologically and morphologically, but little is known regarding their cardiovascular physiology and hemodynamics. We used noninvasive Doppler ultrasound to measure aortic and mitral blood velocity and aortic pulse-wave velocity in 13-mo-old ApoE-KO and wild-type (WT) mice anesthetized with isoflurane. In other mice from the same colony, we measured systolic blood pressure, body weight, heart weight, cholesterol, and hematocrit. Heart rate and blood pressure were comparable (P = not significant) between ApoE-KO and WT mice, but significant decreases (P < 0.001) were found in body weight (-22%) and hematocrit (-11%), and significant increases were found in heart weight (+23%), aortic velocity (+60%), mitral velocity (+81%) (all P < 0.001), and pulse-wave velocity (+13%, P < 0.05). We also found inflections in the aortic arch velocity signal consistent with enhanced peripheral wave reflection. Thus ApoE-KO mice have phenotypic alterations in indexes of peripheral vascular resistance and compliance and significantly elevated cardiac outflow velocities and heart weight-to-body weight ratios.
