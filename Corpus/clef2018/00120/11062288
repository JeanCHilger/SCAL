Use of transcranial Doppler ultrasound to predict outcome in patients with intracranial large-artery occlusive disease. Intracranial large-artery occlusive disease is the predominant vascular lesion found in stroke patients of Asian, African, and Hispanic ancestry, making it numerically perhaps the most common vascular cause of stroke in the world. Relatively little is known about the clinical significance of finding such lesions. We investigate whether the presence and the extent of these vascular lesions help predict outcome after stroke.On the basis of transcranial Doppler of the intracranial arteries with supplementary duplex ultrasound of the carotid arteries, we determined the number of occlusive arteries in the craniocervical circulation of consecutive patients who were hospitalized for acute cerebral ischemia. Patients were followed for 6 months for further vascular events (including transient ischemic attack, stroke, and acute coronary syndrome) or death.Among 705 consecutive Chinese patients studied, occlusive arteries were found in 345 patients (49%): 258 patients (37%) had intracranial lesions only, 71 (10%) had both extracranial and intracranial lesions, and 16 (2.3%) had extracranial lesions only. Sixty-three (18%) of the 345 patients with occlusive arteries and 35 (9.7%) of the 360 patients without occlusive arteries had further vascular event or death within 6 months. The risk of vascular events or death increased rapidly with rising numbers of occlusive arteries, after adjustment for vascular risk factors and stroke severity (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.25 per occlusive artery, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.39). Other independent risk factors included age (OR 1.03 per year of age, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.05) and atrial fibrillation (OR 3.00, 95% CI 1.40 to 6.69).In patients with predominantly intracranial large-artery occlusive disease, the presence and the total number of occlusive arteries in the craniocervical circulation predict further vascular events or death within 6 months after stroke. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound is an important investigation for the evaluation of patients with stroke in populations at risk of intracranial atherosclerotic disease.
