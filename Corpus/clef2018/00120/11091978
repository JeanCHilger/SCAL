The effect of brain compression under venous circulatory impairment. It is well known that surgical obliteration of the cerebral veins with additional brain compression by retractors is dangerous. To evaluate the mechanism, we studied the change in cerebral microcirculation and parenchymal damage following brain compression with venous circulatory impairment using a rat model. The animals were divided into the following four groups (each n = 5) (1) a sham-operated control (2) group A, one cortical vein occlusion
