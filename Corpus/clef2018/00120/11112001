An association between microvascular endothelial dysfunction, transcardiac nitric oxide production and pro-inflammatory cytokines after heart transplantation in humans. Endothelial dysfunction anticipates the development of transplant coronary artery disease (TxCAD) observed more than 1 year after transplantation (HTx). We investigated whether in patients early after HTx myocardial inducible and constitutive nitric oxide synthases (iNOS cNOS) are expressed and cardiac nitric oxide production occurs. Moreover, a possible relationship to alterations in endothelium dependent and independent vasomotor function was assessed. Forty-two transplant recipients were studied 37 +/- 5 days after HTx. Microvascular coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) was tested endothelium dependent (acetylcholine
