A 1-year follow-up quality of life study after hemodynamically successful or unsuccessful surgical revascularization of lower limb ischemia. The impact of hemodynamically successful or unsuccessful bypass grafting or angioplasty on patients' quality of life was assessed throughout the first year postsurgery.A total of 146 patients, 97 patients who underwent successful revascularization and 49 patients who underwent unsuccessful revascularization, were assessed for quality of life with the Nottingham Health Profile.Hemodynamically successful revascularization resulted in an immediate and lasting impact on the patients' quality of life. Despite hemodynamic failure, patients had improvements in pain, emotional reactions, sleep, and family relationships at the 1-year follow-up assessment. A successful revascularization in patients with claudication demonstrated the most marked quality of life benefits, including all health dimensions that were not normal at baseline. Patients with critical ischemia had improved quality of life for pain, sleep, and physical mobility. High ankle pressure, in the claudicant group, and a high sense of coherence were significantly associated with high quality of life.The treatment of lower limb ischemia resulted in an immediate and relatively lasting improvement in patients' quality of life. Patients who underwent hemodynamically successful bypass grafting procedures or angioplasty demonstrated higher quality of life benefits than patients who underwent a failed bypass grafting procedure. Quality of life was further determined by means of the patients' sense of coherence.
