Effect of vazaprostan on microcirculation in patients with scleroderma systematic. To investigate the effect of vazaprostan (alprostadil) on skin blood flow in patients with sclerodermia systematica (SS).A total of 51 patients with SS aged 33-70 years were included in the study. 33 of them received a 3-hour infusion of vazaprostan at the standard dose for 20 consecutive days. The rest 18 patients received low molecular dextran solution. Before and at the end of the treatment digital skin microcirculation was measured with a laser Doppler flowmeter. The laser probe was attached to the distal pad of the ring finger on the left hand. Baseline blood flow and vascular reactivity in the tests with sympathetic stimulation, local heating and during orthostasis were evaluated.Baseline blood flow and vascular response to functional tests were significantly reduced in all the patients. At the end of the treatment the flow increased only in patients treated with vazaprostan. Vascular reactivity was not changed after the treatment in both groups of patients.Vazaprostan increases baseline blood flow and contributes to the improvement of microcirculation in patients with SS.
