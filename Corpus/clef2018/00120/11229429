Contrasting effects of L-arginine on insulin-mediated blood flow and glucose disposal in the elderly. Insulin increases skeletal muscle blood flow in healthy young subjects by a nitric oxide (NO)-dependent mechanism. Impairment of this mechanism may contribute to the insulin resistance of normal aging. We tested the hypothesis that L-arginine, the endogenous precursor for NO synthesis, would augment insulin-mediated vasodilation and in so doing increase insulin-mediated glucose uptake (IMGU) in healthy elderly subjects. Experiments were conducted on healthy young (n = 9 age, 24 +/- 1 years
