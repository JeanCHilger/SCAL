Activation products of the haemostatic system in coronary, cerebrovascular and peripheral arterial disease. To determine the presence of a 'hypercoagulable state' as assessed by indices of thrombin and plasmin generation and of the amount of fibrin that is lysed, in patients with stable coronary, cerebral and peripheral arterial disease a population-based cross-sectional study was performed. From a population-based cohort comprising 7983 men and women aged 55 years and over, we randomly selected 127 subjects with a history of myocardial infarction, 124 with a history of stroke and/or transient ischemic attack, 131 patients with peripheral arterial disease and 263 control subjects in the same age group without arterial disease. Subjects using anticoagulant drugs were not selected. F1+2, TAT, and PAP were not associated with a history of cardiovascular events, nor with peripheral arterial disease. In contrast, positive associations were found for D-Dimer. Mean D-Dimer level was 40 microg/l (95% CI 35, 44) in control subjects 53 microg/l (47, 61) in those with a history of myocardial infarction and 51 microg/l (45, 58) in those with a history of stroke and or transient ischemic attack. D-Dimer increased gradually with increasing severity of peripheral atherosclerosis
