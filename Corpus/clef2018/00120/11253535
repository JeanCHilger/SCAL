Intraoperative and early postoperative results after laparoscopic implantation of aortofemoral bifurcation prostheses. The evaluation of multiple intra- and early postoperative parameters in patients undergoing laparoscopic aortobifemoral bypass grafting.The charts of 22 patients who underwent laparoscopic aortobifemoral grafting between February 2nd, 1996 and April 30th, 1999 were retrospectively reviewed.All patients were men. The mean age was 54 +/- 7.2 years with the mean body weight being 76.3 +/- 10.9 kg and the Body-Mass-Index (BMI) 23 +/- 2.8. Claudication was present in 20 patients one patient had rest pain and one patient suffered from tissue loss. The mean Ankle-Brachial-Index (ABI) was 0.57 +/- 0.1. In four cases conversion to open technique became necessary. The mean operation time was 316 +/- 73 min and the mean aortic cross-clamp time was 73 +/- 20 min. The mean intraoperative blood-loss reached 689 +/- 461 ml. The mean duration of postoperative ventilator support was 6.0 +/- 5.8 hours and the patients left the ICU after 2.2 +/- 3.2 days. Oral intake was allowed after a mean of 2.6 +/- 2.9 days and the central venous lines were removed after 3.8 +/- 3.9 days. The administration of analgetic drugs was required for 2.9 +/- 3.9 days. The mean length of stay in the hospital was 9.6 +/- 5.5 days.Laparoscopic aortobifemoral bypass grafting is feasible in a selected group of patients. Despite relatively long operation times and the use of a pneumoperitoneum, we did not encounter significant cardiopulmonary adverse effects.
