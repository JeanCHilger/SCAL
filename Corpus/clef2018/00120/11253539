Hemobahn endoprosthesis: experience with percutaneous placing in the arteria femoralis superficialis. The self-expanding Polytetrafluoroethylene-lined nitinolstent Hemobahn offers from its design a prophylaxis for re-occlusion after angioplasty of long femoral artery occlusions. During the last two years we placed in 33 patients at 35 extremities a total of 53 Hemobahns. Fontaine's clinical stages were: 30 x IIb, 1 x III and 4 x IV. The treated lesions were femoral stenoses (3x) and occlusions (32x with mean distance 12 cm). Follow-up-visits were after 3, 6 and 12 months. The mean ankle-brachial-index changed from 0.49 to 0.85, post-interventional Fontaine's stages were: 24 x I, 5 x IIa, 2 x IIb and 4 x IV. The primary inhospital patency rate was 91%. After 3 months all primary/secondary patency rates were: 77%/87%, after 6 months 62%/85% and after 1 year 40%/67%. Causes for re-occlusions were a poor "run off", calcifications and multiple vessel lesions. The results for "ideal indications" were much better. Such "ideal indications" applied to: > or = 1 cm "healthy" proximal and distal vascular segments, missing lesions in the popliteal artery, at least one open lower leg vessel and no severe calcifications. The primary/secondary patency rate was inhospital 100% (n = 23), after 3 months 95/100%, after 6 months 85/100% and after 1 year 80/100%. Side effects were local haematoma, pain in the prosthesis and temporarily temperature reactions. Sonographically no re-stenoses at the limb ends were observed. Hemobahn-endoprostheses are suited for therapy of long femoral artery occlusions. The medium patency rate of "ideal indications" is higher than that of angioplasty with or without uncovered stents.
