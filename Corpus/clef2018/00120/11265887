Treatment of infrapopliteal occlusive disease by high-speed rotational atherectomy: initial and mid-term results. To assess the effectiveness and patency rates of high-speed rotational atherectomy (HSRA) for the treatment of infrapopliteal arterial occlusive disease.During an 18-month period, a total of 19 infrapopliteal lesions in 15 consecutive patients were treated primarily by HSRA with use of the Rotablator device. Patients were followed up with documentation of clinical symptoms, standardized treadmill exercise, and Doppler sonography at 1, 3, and 6 months. Control angiography was performed 6 months after primary treatment.HSRA was initially successful in 14 of 15 patients, yielding an initial technical success rate of 94%. Percutaneous treatment induced an improvement of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) from 0.6 +/- 0.09 to 0.86 +/- 0.2 after intervention (P < .0001). Doppler analysis showed a mean ABI of 0.85 +/- 0.2 (P < .001) at 1 month, 0.72 +/- 0.2 (P = .012) at 3 months, and 0.7 +/- 0.2 (P = .08) at 6 months after initial therapy. Although six patients were lost to follow-up at various times, control angiography at 6 months was carried out in nine of 15 patients, allowing direct assessment of 12 of 19 treated lesions. Among six high-grade restenoses and five total occlusions in the treated vascular segments, only one arterial lumen (of 12) remained patent without presenting a hemodynamically relevant restenosis. These results led to termination of the study.Although HSRA for the treatment of infrapopliteal occlusive disease yields a very high initial technical success rate, mid-term results are extremely poor. Therefore, HSRA cannot be recommended for primary treatment of this type of lesion.
