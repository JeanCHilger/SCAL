Intravascular ultrasound Doppler measurement of blood flow velocity. The authors investigated the feasibility and accuracy of intravascular Doppler sonography (IVDS) with a newly developed microprobe.The known method to determine blood flow velocity by transcutaneous Doppler sonography was transferred to an intravascular usable Doppler probe. With the improved technique, a microprobe measuring 0.3 mm in diameter can be advanced through a 5F catheter used in routine diagnostic angiography to perform intravascular Doppler sonography. In a first step, the conditions for application and measurement were studied in a flow tube model and were transferred in a second step to patients undergoing routine angiography and patients with arterial stenoses.Measurements with nondegassed liquids showed a high intensive acoustic signal, but no echo effect could be recorded in degassed liquids. IVDS of healthy vessels in 40 patients showed the same typical flow pulse curve as seen in transcutaneous measurements. The optimal position of the microprobe with respect to the contact of the vessel wall, the diastolic and systolic phase, and the distance to the tip of the catheter could be evaluated. In 95.6% of the 40 patients with healthy vessels, IVDS was successful. Fourteen patients with arterial stenotic diseases were investigated before and after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, and the results of these investigations correlated well with the angiographical results.For percutaneously directly reachable vessels, the transcutaneous Doppler sonography is the choice for easy noninvasive and inexpensive measurement of blood flow velocity. However, for vessels that are difficult or impossible to reach percutaneously, intravascular measurement is a valid procedure.
