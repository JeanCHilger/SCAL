Role of transesophageal echocardiography in the evaluation of patients with retinal artery occlusion. To evaluate the role of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in detecting cardiac and thoracic aortic sources of retinal emboli.Retrospective observational case series.The study population consisted of 18 patients who were initially seen with retinal artery occlusion (7 central, 11 branch) and underwent TEE as part of the systemic evaluation.All patients underwent TEE, consisting of complete two-dimensional and Doppler color flow examinations. TEE was done immediately after transthoracic echo (TTE) examination. The medical records were reviewed.Detection of a possible cardiac or thoracic aortic source of retinal embolus.Cardiac or thoracic aortic pathologic conditions, which were a possible source of the retinal emboli, were detected by TEE in 13 of the 18 patients (72%). They included aortic arch atheroma (n = 7), mitral annulus calcification (n = 4), left atrial appendage thrombus (n = 2), valvular abnormalities (n = 5), left atrial smoke (n = 3), and patent foramen ovale (n = 3). In 11 patients (61%), at least one cardiac or aortic source of emboli detected by TEE was missed by TTE. Significant carotid artery disease (>or=40% stenosis) was present in 3 of 16 patients (17%).TEE is a potentially useful modality for detecting possible sources of retinal artery emboli and may be considered as an adjunct to the routine evaluation of affected patients.
