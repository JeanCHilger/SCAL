Laser doppler flowmetry in combined needle acupuncture and moxibustion: a pilot study in healthy adults. Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) (DRT 4/Moor Instruments Ltd, Devon, UK) was used in this pilot study for monitoring the effects of an invariable acupuncture pattern on microcirculation of the skin before, during, and after combined needle acupuncture and moxibustion in 12 healthy volunteers (mean age 35.2 +/- 4.4 years, range 26-41 years, four female and eight male). According to the standards of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), this acupuncture pattern is assumed to be unspecific and non-therapeutic. Flux decreased during the treatment period (p<0.05) compared to the control phase before combined needle acupuncture and moxibustion. After the removal of the needles, flux did not return to the initial control value. No significant differences between mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, skin temperature or gender were detected. A prediction of individual incidences and kinds of acupuncture effects in our healthy volunteers was not possible. Modern monitoring techniques like LDF could be a method to separate responders from non-responders to acupuncture in peripheral microcirculatory disorders. Further studies on patients with peripheral microcirculatory disorders are necessary in order to demonstrate the value of LDF in detecting responders/non-responders in combination with therapeutic acupuncture patterns according to TCM.
