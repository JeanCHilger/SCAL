A study of segmentary arterial blood pressure in the evaluation of obstructive arteriopathy of the lower limbs (author's transl). The pressure segmentary systolic blood pressure of lower limbs is described in normal and arteriopathic subjects. After reviewing the various methods currently used, the authors emphasize the diagnostic value of ankle/arm pressure index and segmentary gradient. The limits of the method are also discussed. The changes in ankle pressure after exercise are then considered, as a noninvasive useful technique in the functional evaluation of obstructive arterial disease in the lower limbs.
