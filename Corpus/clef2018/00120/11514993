Reproducibility of intravascular ultrasound and intracoronary Doppler measurements. The aim of this study was to evaluate the reproducibility of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and intracoronary (IC) Doppler flow velocity measurements. The use of IVUS and IC Doppler has been suggested as a means for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) guidance in a series of studies. This would require an acceptable level of accuracy and reproducibility of these two methods for lesion evaluation. In this study, the main focus was on the issue of reproducibility. One hundred and eight patients referred for PCI entered into the study. Inter- and intraobserver variability was measured. Catheter difference was assessed. On-line and off-line measurements were compared. MUSIC criteria were assessed off-line, twice. Calculated and measured diameters were compared. After having obtained initial IC Doppler measurements, the Doppler wire was immediately withdrawn and repositioned for reacquisition of Doppler measurements. IVUS measurements are reproducible and reliable off-line and, to a slightly lesser degree, on-line. Area measurements should be performed more than once and the mean used for vessel description. Lumen diameters should be calculated from the mean of the area measurements. A measuring technique consensus should be reached and adhered to. CFR measurements can be used to determine reduced vs. normal flow reserve. In this study, it was found that proximal to distal velocity ratio and diastolic to systolic velocity ratio variability made these parameters unsuitable for PCI guidance.
