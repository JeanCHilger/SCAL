Mitochondrial function and oxygen supply in normal and in chronically ischemic muscle: a combined 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy and near infrared spectroscopy study in vivo. We used (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) as a means of quantifying abnormalities in calf muscle oxygenation and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) turnover in peripheral vascular disease (PVD).Eleven male patients with PVD (mean age, 65 years range, 55-76 years) and nine male control subjects of similar age were observed in a case-control study in vascular outpatients. Inclusion criteria were more than 6 months' calf claudication (median, 1.5 yearsCompared with control subjects, patients with PVD showed (1) normal muscle cross-sectional area, MVC, ATP turnover, and contractile efficiency (ATP turnover per force/area) (2) larger phosphocreatine (PCr) changes during exercise (ie, increased shortfall of oxidative ATP synthesis) and slower PCr recovery (47% +/- 7% [mean +/- SEM] decrease in functional capacity for oxidative ATP synthesis, P = .001)The primary lesion in oxygen supply dominates muscle metabolism. Reduced force-generation in patients who are affected more may protect muscle from metabolic stress.
