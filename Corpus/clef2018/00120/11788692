Initial experience with the combination of reteplase and abciximab for thrombolytic therapy in peripheral arterial occlusive disease: a pilot study. To report the efficacy of catheter-directed thrombolysis with a combination of a thrombolytic agent (reteplase) and a glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa platelet receptor antagonist (abciximab) in peripheral arterial occlusive disease.Fifteen patients with lower extremity arterial thromboses (age range, 40-96 y mean, 73 y) were prospectively enrolled in a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Committee. Nine patients had native arterial occlusions, three (33%) of whom had subacute symptoms (>14 d) and one of whom had chronic symptoms (>3 mo). Four patients had acute arterial graft thromboses. Two patients with lower extremity bypass grafts presented with subacute limb ischemia. All patients received catheter-directed infusion of reteplase (0.5 U/h) in combination with intravenous administration of abciximab (0.25-mg/kg bolus followed by 0.125 microg/kg/min infusion) for 12 hours without systemic heparinization. The thrombolytic success was studied by Doppler ultrasonography (US) and angiography.Complete thrombolysis and clinical success was achieved in 14 of the 15 patients (93%). One patient with unsuccessful thrombolysis underwent major amputation. The mean thrombolysis time per Doppler US procedure was 6.8 hours (range, 2-30 h). Angiographic patency was achieved at a mean of 17.5 hours (range, 4-36 h) corresponding to a mean dose of reteplase of 8.8 U. The mean increase in ankle-brachial index was 0.52 (range, 0-0.9). No major hemorrhagic complications occurred. The 30-day primary patency rate was 93%.The combination of reteplase and abciximab in catheter-directed arterial thrombolysis is feasible and effective. This combination therapy pilot study suggests short thrombolysis times and minimal adverse effects in catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy for peripheral arterial occlusive disease.
