Diagnosis and treatment of the main arteries in the lower extremities of patients with diabetic foot syndrome. Results of examination and treatment of 209 patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), complicated by purulent-necrotic affection of foot (PNAF), were analyzed. While choosing patients to determine indications for reconstructive operation performance segmentary pressure (SP) on posterior tibial artery on level of her low third was measured, shoulder-scapular index (SSI) and the PNAF stage (according to classification of Wagner) were determined. In 16% of patients with diabetic affection of III-IV stages, SP indexes ranging 9.3-12.0 kPa (70-90 mm Hg), SSI 0.6-0.9 stenosis or occlusion of the lower extremity main arteries, demanding surgical correction to be done, was revealed. Reconstructive operation on vessels was done in 26 patients with restricted stenosis of femoro-popliteal segment, according to ultrasonic Dopplerometry results, passability of the leg arteries, distance of more than 50 metres, which passes patient without painful sensations, value of SP in both arteries of leg ranging 9.3-12.0 kPa (70-90 mm Hg), SSI more than 0.6. Revascularization operation on arteries of lower extremity was successful in 46 (94%) of 49 patients with DM and PNAF.
