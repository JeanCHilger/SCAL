Evaluation of progression and spread of atherothrombosis. Symptomatic atherothrombosis in one vascular bed is usually indicative of disseminated disease. Indeed, involvement of multiple beds is common in everyday clinical practice, and these patients are at much higher risk of ischaemic events. The prevention of manifestations following atherothrombosis is therefore an important therapeutic goal in these patients. Some causative risk factors demonstrate affinities to particular arterial domains. Cigarette smoking, for example, is particularly associated with atherothrombotic involvement of the pelvic and lower limb arteries, whereas arterial hypertension is associated with the intracranial cerebral arteries. The degree, spread and progression of atherosclerosis can be assessed using various non-invasive and invasive modalities: high-resolution Doppler ultrasound, ankle-brachial index (ABI) measurement, magnetic resonance (MR), computed tomography (CT) and intra-arterial angiography. Indicators of atherothrombotic risk include increased carotid artery intima-media thickness, microembolic signals on transcranial Doppler ultrasonography and low ABI. There is a strong rationale for the inclusion of the ABI measurement as part of the routine clinical examination to assess the cardiovascular risk in patients with identified risk factors. Furthermore, detection of a low ABI should serve as a trigger for patient management with aggressive antiplatelet therapy. The generalized nature of atherothrombosis and the methods for evaluating the spread of disease are illustrated through the case history of a patient with disseminated atherothrombotic disease.
