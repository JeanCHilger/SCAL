20-HETE contributes to the acute fall in cerebral blood flow after subarachnoid hemorrhage in the rat. This study examined the effects of blocking the formation of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) on the acute fall in cerebral blood flow after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in the rat. In vehicle-treated rats, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) measured with laser-Doppler flowmetry fell by 30% 10 min after the injection of 0.3 ml of arterial blood into the cisterna magna, and it remained at this level for 2 h. Pretreatment with inhibitors of the formation of 20-HETE, 17-octadecynoic acid (17-ODYA 1.5 nmol intrathecally) and N-hydroxy-N'-(4-butyl-2-methylphenyl)formamidine (HET0016
