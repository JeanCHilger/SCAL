A new method for measuring oxidative stress in claudicants during strenuous exercise using free radical derivatives of antipyrine as indicators: a pilot study. Patients with intermittent claudication disease suffer from temporary lack of oxygen in the legs, caused by narrowing of arteries, resulting in ischemia and followed by reperfusion. The degree of oxidative stress present in 16 patients during strenuous exercise was determined using several indicators. Two derivatives of an exogenous marker, antipyrine (AP), (ie, p-hydroxyantipyrine, p-APOH, and o-hydroxyantipyrine, o-APOH), were assayed in plasma using HPLC-tandem-MS. Plasma malondialdehyde (assayed as thiobarbituric acid reactive species, TBARS) was also determined. The branchial/ankle blood pressure index (b-a index) was used to assess the severity of intermittent claudication disease, and plasma lactate concentration was also measured as an indicator of the ischemic situation. Plasma TBARS level did not change significantly after exercise. During the ischemic situation as well as during reperfusion, both free radical derivatives of antipyrine increased significantly in plasma (p < 0.01). Because p-APOH is also formed enzymatically in humans, the plasma ratio of o-APOH to AP appeared to be the most specific marker for oxidative stress in patients with intermittent claudication.
