Force to restore the shape of an asymmetric extracorporeal tube as the basis for non-invasive pressure measurements. A zero-balance principle is described where intraluminal pressure is estimated from the counter force needed to restore the tube shape of an elastic extra corporeal tube. The aim was to optimise cross-sectional tube geometry for tube expansion due to pressure and to reduce the sensitivity to variation in mechanical tube characteristics using an experimental statistical and factorial design. The main application is pressure monitoring in blood and dialysate tubes during hemodialysis. Improving the monitoring of the dialysis process will reduce complications, such as sudden decreases in systemic blood pressure or occlusion at the artero-venous fistula. The factorial design indicated strong influence from the geometrical characteristics of the tube as well from the geometrical design parameters of the pressure transducer. We found a consistent relationship between the intraluminal pressure and the applied force needed to restore the tube shape. The modified cross-sectional tube geometry enhances measurement sensitivity and facilitates the desired behavior of tubes during pressure applications.
