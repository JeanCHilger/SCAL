Age-related changes in vasomotor reflex control of calf venous capacitance response to lower body negative pressure in humans. The present study was performed to test the hypothesis that calf venous capacitance would be reduced by mild gravitational stress through a vasomotor reflex in humans, and this response could be diminished with advancing age. Nine young (31 +/- 1 years, mean +/- SE) and 9 elderly (69 +/- 1 years) healthy males were exposed to a lower body negative pressure (LBNP) of 15 mmHg. Venous occlusion plethysmography was used to measure calf venous capacitance and calf blood flow. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) was recorded microneurographically from the tibial nerve along with cardiovascular variables. It was found that baseline MSNA was higher [21 +/- 4 (mean +/- SE) vs. 37 +/- 5 bursts x min(-1), young vs. elderly p < 0.05] and calf venous capacitance was lower (1.71 +/- 0.12 vs. 1.44 +/- 0.10, ml x 100 ml(-1), young vs. elderly
