Measures to prevent renal impairment after resection of retroperitoneal neuroblastoma. Postoperative renal impairment has been reported after kidney-preserving resection of retroperitoneal neuroblastomas (NB). To avoid renal damage, intraoperative procedures include monitoring of central venous pressure (CVP) and diuresis, i.v. administration of electrolyte solutions, mannitol, and furosemide, and local application of lidocaine to the renal vessels. During the first 5 postoperative (p.o.) days, CVP, diuresis, body temperature (T), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were monitored color Doppler ultrasound (CDUS) was also performed on the 7th p.o. day. Simultaneous increases of T (>38.5 degrees ) and LDH (>1,500 IU/l) and/or reduction of urinary flow (< 1.5 ml/kg.h) were indicative of renal damage: in these cases dopamine was administered and CDUS performed. If renal blood flow was normal on CDUS, dopamine was administered for another 2 days
