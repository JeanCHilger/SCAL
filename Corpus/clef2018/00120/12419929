Usefulness of the Symphony Nitinol Stent for arteriosclerosis obliterans. The Symphony Peripheral Stent is a self-expanding stent made of thermal memory Nitinol wire. Stents were implanted in 39 lesions of 32 patients (26 men, 6 women) with atherosclerosis obliterans (ASO). The ankle-arm index (AAI), and vessel diameters evaluated by quantitative angiography were compared before and 6 months after treatment. Symphony Peripheral Stent implantation significantly improved the AAI from 0.50+/-0.4 to 0.9+/-0.2 (p<0.01), the minimum lumen diameter (MLD) from 2+/-1.5 to 5+/-1.4 mm (p<0.01) and percent diameter stenosis (% DS) from 69+/-20% to 16.5+/-8% (p<0.01). Re-evaluation of 33 of the 39 lesions 6 months after treatment revealed a low restenosis rate of 15%, an AAI of 0.8+/-0.3, MLD of 4.5+/-2 mm and %DS of 30+/-22%, so the Symphony Peripheral Stent is thus a promising choice for patients with ASO.
