Surface modifications to improve biocompatibility and mechanical properties of orthopedic implants. State of the art surface modifications on metallic materials for orthopedic and dental implants permit clinical application if implant design,manufacturing process as well as function and duration of implantation are harmonized with each other. Keeping these prerequisites in mind,hydroxylapatite is suited for closer connection of fixation elements in hard tissue. PVD or PECVD modifications can make gliding surfaces or surfaces of fixation elements abrasion resistant if the pressure-area ratio does not exceed threshold values in cases of surfaces moving relative to each other
