Effects of coronary artery bypass surgery on diastolic and systolic parameters of left ventricle in Type II diabetic patients. Diabetes mellitus itself can cause systolic and diastolic dysfunctions of the left ventricle in the absence of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. Effects of coronary bypass surgery on the left ventricular functions of Type II diabetic patients having atherosclerotic coronary artery disease were investigated. Forty-eight Type II diabetic and 63 nondiabetic multivessel coronary artery disease patients who had no differences in age, sex, drugs used, number of revascularized arteries and aortic cross-clamp time were included in the study. Doppler echocardiographic examinations before and 6 months after operations were made, and early diastolic flow (E), atrial contraction (A), deceleration (DT) and isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT), E/A ratio and systolic parameters like end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, stroke volume and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were measured in sequence. Preoperative and postoperative echocardiographic measurements were compared in the same group and between groups by paired t and Student's t tests, respectively. P<.05 was accepted as statistically significant. E, A, E/A, DT, IVRT and LVEF were significantly improved after coronary bypass surgery in Groups I (P<.001, P<.01, P<.001, P<.01, P<.0001, P<.01) and II (P<.05, P<.05, P<.001, P<.001, P<.001, P<.001). Statistical comparison of values between groups showed better recovery in diastolic and systolic functions of diabetic and nondiabetic patients, respectively. It was concluded that Type II diabetic coronary patients by time could gain as much as the same benefit from coronary bypass surgery that nondiabetic patients had.
