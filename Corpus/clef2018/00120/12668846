Superficial femoral artery occlusion: nitinol stents achieve better flow and reduce the need for medications than balloon angioplasty alone. Nitinol slotted tube stents are of great potential benefit in superficial femoral artery (SFA) interventions due to their elastic properties. However, a paucity of data exists for their efficacy in total SFA occlusions.Using the Cleveland Clinic Foundation Peripheral Database, we identified 40 consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous revascularization for chronically occluded SFA and addressed the outcome stratifying for stent use. We evaluated the reduction in the pressure gradient across the lesion and the need for medication following revascularization.Of the 40 patients, twenty-six underwent balloon angioplasty alone and 14 received nitinol slotted tube stents. Patients were well matched for age and cardiovascular risk factors. Similarly, there were no differences in baseline ankle brachial index (ABI) or claudication class between the groups. Compared to angioplasty alone, stenting was associated with a greater reduction in translesional pressure gradient (72 mmHg versus 32 mmHg p = 0.002). In addition, patients treated with stents were less likely to require post-procedure adjunctive medical treatment (7.1% versus 42.6%In SFA occlusion, stenting results in greater reduction in translesional pressure gradient and reduced need for adjunctive medical treatment.
