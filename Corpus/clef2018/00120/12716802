Fibrinogen is a marker for nephropathy and peripheral vascular disease in type 1 diabetes: studies of plasma fibrinogen and fibrinogen gene polymorphism in the DCCT/EDIC cohort. We examined whether plasma fibrinogen levels and the beta-fibrinogen gene G(-455)-->A polymorphism were related to microvascular or macrovascular disease in patients (n = 909) with type 1 diabetes enrolled in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (DCCT/ EDIC). Univariate regression showed that fibrinogen levels were correlated with BMI (r = 0.15 P < 0.0001), HbA(1c) (r = 0.11
