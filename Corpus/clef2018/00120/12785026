Prevalence and risk factors of peripheral arterial obstructive disease in Taiwanese type 2 diabetic patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and risk factors of peripheral arterial obstructive disease (PAD) in Taiwanese type 2 diabetic patients. A total of 610 patients (268 men and 342 women), aged 63.3 +/- 10.8 years, were recruited from a diabetic clinic in a teaching hospital. PAD was diagnosed by an ankle-brachial index (ABI) < 0.9 on either leg. Risk factors studied were age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking, diabetes duration, hypertension, insulin therapy, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), serum total cholesterol (TC), and triglyceride (TG). Overall prevalence of PAD was 10.0% without significant sexual difference. Univariate analyses disclosed age, BMI (inverse association), diabetes duration, hypertension, insulin therapy, and SBP as significant risk factors. In stepwise logistic regression, age, SBP, BMI, and insulin therapy were independent risk factors with respective odds ratios (95% confidence intervals, CI) of 1.09 (1.05-1.13), 1.02 (1.01-1.04), 0.88 (0.80-0.96), and 3.37 (1.83-6.19). In conclusion, prevalence of PAD in Taiwanese type 2 diabetic patients was 10.0% and the major risk factors were older age, lower BMI, higher SBP, and insulin therapy. The inverse association between PAD and BMI is contradictory to the general impression that obesity is a risk factor for PAD.
