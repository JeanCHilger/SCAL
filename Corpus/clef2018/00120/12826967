The effect of hypothermia on the expression of the apoptosis-regulating protein Bax after incomplete cerebral ischemia and reperfusion in rats. This study investigated the effects of hypothermia on apoptosis-regulating proteins in a rat model of incomplete cerebral ischemia. Twenty-seven fasted male Sprague-Dawley rats (300-420 g) were anesthetized, intubated, and mechanically ventilated with 2.0% isoflurane and N(2)O/O(2) (FiO(2) = 0.33). Catheters were inserted and cerebral blood flow velocity was measured using bilateral laser Doppler flowmetry. At the end of preparation, the administration of isoflurane was replaced by fentanyl (25 microg. kg(-1). h(-1)). Animals were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: group 1 (n = 9, normothermia), normothermia (37.5 degrees C) during ischemia group 2 (n = 9, hypothermia), 34 degrees C pericranial temperature during ischemia
