The prevalence, detection, and epidemiological correlates of peripheral vascular disease: a comparison of diabetic and non-diabetic subjects in an English community. A cross-sectional study was performed to investigate the distribution, methods of detection, and potential risk factors for peripheral vascular disease in a diabetic population with comparison to an age and sex matched non-diabetic group. The population came from a geographically defined area consisting of 10 general practices (total list size 97,034) and covered rural and urban districts of East Dorset. Peripheral vascular disease was defined as an ankle/brachial Doppler pressure ratio of 0.9 or less. Of the diabetic subjects reviewed, 864 were classified as having Type 2 diabetes and 213 Type 1 diabetes. The prevalence of peripheral vascular disease in Type 1 diabetes was 8.7% (95% CI 4.9-12.5) and in Type 2 diabetes 23.5% (95% CI 20.5-26.5), which after adjusting for age was not significantly different (odds ratio 1.5, 95% CI 0.8-2.7, p = 0.18). There was no difference in the frequency of symptomatic peripheral vascular disease or the site of occlusion between diabetic and non-diabetic subjects with peripheral vascular disease. Age, cerebrovascular disease, coronary artery disease, glucose, body mass index, and cholesterol in Type 2 diabetes and age and proteinuria in Type 1 diabetes were significant predictors of peripheral vascular disease. In the non-diabetic group, age and cigarettes smoked were significant variables. These findings suggest that clinical features of peripheral vascular disease in diabetic and non-diabetic subjects are similar but risk determinants may be different.
