Catheter-induced femoral artery lesions: diagnosis with B-mode ultrasound, Doppler ultrasound and color Doppler ultrasound. A total of 44 patients were evaluated to compare the value of B-mode sonography, Doppler sonography and colour coded Doppler sonography. All patients were studied because of suspected lesions of the femoral arteries following diagnostic and/or therapeutic cardiac catheterisation. B-mode sonography was unable to reliably differentiate between haematoma and pseudo-aneurysms, a.v.-fistula or combined lesions. Colour coded Doppler sonography can better demonstrate haematoma and thrombi in pseudo-aneurysms. The neck of a pseudoaneurysm can be exactly depicted by colour coded Doppler sonography. A.v.-fistula is shown by colour coded Doppler sonography based on typical colour coding and the Doppler spectrum. Combined lesions of pseudo-aneurysm and a.v.-fistula cannot reliably be detected by colour coded Doppler sonography, duplex sonography and B-mode sonography.
