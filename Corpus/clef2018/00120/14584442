Characteristics of diagnosis of peripheral arterial occlusive disease in diabetic patients. This pitfall should be avoided. Doppler pressure measurement with determination of the ankle-arm indices, and duplex ultrasonography, together form the basis of the diagnostic investigation of the vascular system in diabetics. MR angiography and arteriography are not screening methods in suspected peripheral blood flow disorders. MR angiography should be applied only when findings are unclear and the therapeutic consequences uncertain. Invasive therapeutic measures (angioplasty, vascular surgery, amputation) must still be preceded by intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography as the method of choice.
