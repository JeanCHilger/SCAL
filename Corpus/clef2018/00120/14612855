Carotid intima-media thickness as predictor of secondary events after coronary angioplasty. Subjects with symptomatic or asymptomatic peripheral arterial or cerebro-vascular disease have an increased risk of death or cardiovascular event. The aim of this study was to determine whether intima-media thickening of the common carotid artery and/or a low ankle brachial index (ABI) are related with an increased risk of cardio-vascular event after percutaneous coronary angioplasty (PTCA).One hundred and thirteen consecutive, patients (88 males, 25 females, mean age: 62 years) undergoing PTCA were included. Intima media thickness (IMT) of the common carotid artery and ABI were measured within the 2 days following the PTCA. Subjects were followed up for 10.2 +/- 4 months. The end-point was a composite criterion associating death, non fatal acute myocardial infarction, recurrence or worsening of angina pectoris, hospitalisation for heart failure, new positive exercise stress testing.In the follow-up study a common carotid IMT >0.7 mm was a predictor of event (p=0.03) in the univariate analysis. The other risk factors were unstable angina (p=0.001) and PTCA on the left descending coronary artery (p<0.05). We did not find any relation between the end-point and ABI or presence of atheroma on the common femoral artery. In the logistic regression analysis unstable angina was associated with a 3.14 fold increased risk (IC 95%: 1.51-6.4, p=0.002), subjects without HMG-CoA inhibitors drugs at the inclusion had also an increased risk of 2.5 (IC 95%:1.09-5.75, p=0.02).This study suggest that CCA-IMT is associated with an increased risk of cardiac events after PTCA. The measurement of subclinical disease could be useful for identifying high-risk patients.
