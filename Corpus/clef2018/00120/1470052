Correlation studies of the validity of hemodynamic measuring techniques in peripheral arterial occlusive diseases. With the aim of validating the methodology employed for Fontaine's classification, haemodynamic correlation investigations were carried out on a group of 35 patients suffering from stage I to IV peripheral arterial occlusive disease and in six healthy patients. These investigations showed that the measurement of tcPO2 at +44 degrees C, capillaroscopy in the foot, measurement of the arterial blood pressure in the ankle by Doppler ultrasound, and measurement of peak flow in the lower limb using venous plethysmography are suitable for distinguishing normal from abnormal blood flow states. A comparison of the various methods made it clear that determination of Fontaine's stages is best achieved by a combination of arterial systolic blood pressure measurement at the ankle with Doppler ultrasound and vital capillaroscopy in the foot. Used alone, vital capillaroscopy, tcPO2 measurement and plethysmography all failed to differentiate Fontaine's stages with adequate reliability.
