Is systolic blood pressure recovery after exercise a predictor of mortality? An attenuated systolic blood pressure recovery after exercise has been associated with the severity of atherosclerotic heart disease.For 6 years, we observed 12,379 patients who underwent symptom-limited exercise testing. We excluded patients receiving antihypertensive medication and patients with valvular disease, emphysema, end-stage renal disease, heart failure, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and atrial fibrillation. Blood pressure recovery ratio was defined as the ratio of systolic blood pressure at 3 minutes into recovery to systolic blood pressure at peak exercise this has been shown to correlate with angiographic severity of coronary disease.The blood pressure recovery ratios ranged from 0.36 to 1.62, with values for increasing quartiles of 0.72 +/- 0.05, 0.82 +/- 0.02, 0.88 +/- 0.02, and 0.99 +/- 0.07. During follow-up, there were 430 deaths (3%). Five-year Kaplan Meier survival rates were 0.975, 0.974, 0.969, and 0.966 in quartiles 1 to 4, respectively. Compared with patients in the lowest quartile of blood pressure recovery ratio, patients in the highest quartile were at somewhat increased risk (hazard ratio, 1.71 95% CI, 1.31-2.24In this low-risk population, abnormal systolic blood pressure recovery after exercise was not independently predictive of mortality after correcting for differences in baseline and exercise characteristics.
