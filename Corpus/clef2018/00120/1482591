The prognosis of the efficacy of revascularization of the penile corpora cavernosa in the surgical treatment of Leriche's syndrome. The authors have developed a procedure for predicting the efficiency of penal spongy body revascularization in surgical management. Thirteen qualitative parameters, such as duration of sexual dysfunction, libido, having a sexual intercourse partner, degree of intermittent claudication, duration of lower extremity diseases, penal erection angle after drug test and ultrasound Doppler echography with drug test, were evaluated in 36 patients with Leriche's syndrome and erectile dysfunction. The qualitative parameters obtained were converted to quantitative discrete characteristics. The set of characteristics was used to predict the postoperative parameter--the value characterizing the sexual function by using the well-known methods of regression analysis on a PS/XI personal computer by the multiple regression programme in the Statgraphics program package. The high accuracy of prediction of the value characterizing the sexual function by this method makes it possible to substantiate the expediency of penal spongy body revascularization and opens up new ways for improving its outcomes.
