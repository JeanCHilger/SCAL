Original nitinol monowire stent for percutaneous iliac arterial reconstructions. Nitinol monowire stents of original construction were implanted to 35 patients (aged from 36 to 84, mean 53.9) with atherosclerotic lesions of iliac arteries. Arterial stenosis ranged from 50% to 100% (mean 72.2%), ankle-brachial index (ABI) averaged 0.45+/-0.12. Initial success was achieved in 97.1% of procedures. Ultrasonography 3 days since the procedure showed the increase of ABI up to 0.78+/-0.16. Restenoses in the stented site was revealed during follow-up period (mean 24.3+/-18.3 months) in 3 patients (8.3%). In conclusion, new stent appeared to be effective tool for treatment of iliac atherosclerotic lesions. However long-term restenoses resulting from intimal hyperplasia can require repetitive revascularization.
