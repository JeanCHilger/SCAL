Resting and maximal forearm skin blood flows are reduced in hypertension. To find whether the vasodilator capacity of nonacral skin is reduced in hypertension, we measured forearm blood flow by venous occlusion plethysmography in 10 seated normotensive (mean +/- SD mean arterial pressure, 94 +/- 5 mm Hg) and 10 hypertensive (112 +/- 9 mm Hg) men at rest for 39 minutes while the forearm was heated with water at 42 degrees C, a maneuver known to selectively and maximally vasodilate skin. Blood pressure, measured every 5 minutes, did not change with heating. We found that in the normotensive group resting forearm blood flow was higher (3.64 +/- 1.12 versus 2.48 +/- 0.58 ml/100 ml tissue per minute, p less than 0.001 normotensive group versus hypertensive group) and resting forearm vascular resistance lower (30.17 +/- 10.99 versus 48.88 +/- 17.37 mm Hg.min.100 ml tissue per minute, p less than 0.05
