CT angiography in the assessment of carotid atherosclerotic disease: results of more than two years' experience. To assess the role of CT Angiography (CTA) in patients with carotid atherosclerotic disease as compared to echo-colour Doppler (CDUS) ultrasound of the supra-aortic trunks (SAT) and surgery.Eighty-two patients with suspected carotid atherosclerotic disease were submitted to CDUS and CTA of the supra-aortic trunks. Agreement between CDUS and CTA was first evaluated with regard to the following parameters: degree of stenosis according to NASCET criteria, plaque morphology, presence of ulcerations, tandem lesions and vessel abnormalities. Secondly, data provided by the two methodologies were compared with the surgical specimens (35 patients) in 12 cases, the stenosis was measured on the cast of the carotid plaque made of for biologic use silicone.The correlation between CDUS and CTA in evaluating the degree of stenosis was 75.6% poor agreement was found for mild (61.1%) and severe (69.1%) stenosesCTA is recommended as a second-level examination in patients with carotid atherosclerotic steno-obstructive disease who are surgical candidates.
