Coronary flow reserve of the angiographically normal left anterior descending coronary artery in patients with remote coronary artery disease. Coronary artery disease (CAD) has been suggested to alter coronary flow reserve (CFR the ratio between hyperemic and baseline coronary flow velocities) not only in territories supplied by stenotic arteries but also in angiographically normal, remote regions. However, few data exist regarding the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery as the normal index artery. The influence of remote CAD on CFR of the angiographically normal LAD was evaluated with transthoracic Doppler ultrasound to measure CFR in the LAD during 90 seconds of venous adenosine infusion (140 microg/kg/min) in 122 subjects who were assigned to 1 group
