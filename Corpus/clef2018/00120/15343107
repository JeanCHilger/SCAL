Vascular resistances in lower limb arterial disease used to evaluate the quality of peripheral arteries. Preliminary study. Peripheral resistance of lower limb arteries is not a common clinical measurement despite easy-to-apply non-invasive techniques. The aim of our trial has been to test this new parameter as a marker of arterial lesions.In this prospective study, hemodynamic data acquired non-invasively [Ankle brachial index (ABI), peak systolic velocity (PSV), end-diastole velocity (VTD) and peripheral artery quality] in patients with lower limb arterial disease were compared with the resistance index measured in the common femoral artery (Arbeille index: IR=VTD/PSV).Between February 1, 2003 and April 30, 2003, 150 measurements of resistance index were made in 99 individuals with ischemia following a strain (69% men, 31% women, average age 64.8+/-15.2 years). Forty-one of the resistance measurements (27%) were also made in patients with arterial disease factors (diabetics, renal replacement therapy). The resistance index was closely associated with end-diastole velocity. (r=-0.76 DDL=148These findings suggest that the hemodynamic impact might be evaluated more precisely diabetics and renal replacement therapy patients whose hemodynamic parameters are difficult to assess due to their arterial disease factors. Prospective studies are needed to determine the role of the resistance index in the follow up of these patients, and its contribution in comparison with the measurement of end-diastole velocity.
