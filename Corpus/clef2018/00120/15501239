Laser Doppler anemometry distinguishes primary Raynaud phenomenon from VWF syndrome. We evaluated two microcirculatory function-tests, the Laser Doppler (LD)-Anemometry and the Laser Doppler Imager (LDI)-Flowmetry in their value to further elucidate functional behavior of the "Vibration-induced white finger syndrome" (VWF) and to distinguish between Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) of idiopathic or vibration origin.Ninety-four patients, suffering from RP were studied (78 patients with primary RP and 16 patients with VWF). Measurement of blood cell velocity (BCV) before and after provocation was obtained by nailfold capillary microscopy and an included Laser detector ("Anemometry"). Digital blood flux was recorded by LDI-Flowmetry during a standardized cooling and rewarming thermal challenge."Time to peak" of BCV, a measure of maximal reactive hyperemia was longer in VWF in comparison to primary RP (30.37 versus 19.29 sec P < 0.02), respectively.Based on the fact, that prolongation of reactive hyperemia, an indicator of impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation is also frequently found in peripheral arterial occlusive disease, it is hypothesized that VWF is not only a microcirculatory vasospastic disorder, but may also be related to atherosclerosis. Anemometry, in association with an appropriate provocation-test, could represent a useful non-invasive method for objectifying diagnosis of VWF in patients with RP.
