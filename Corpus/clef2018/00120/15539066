Study and evaluation of patients with obliterating arteriopathy of the lower limbs: use of isokinetics to analyze muscular strength and fatigue. The aim of the study was to evaluate strength of the dorsal and plantar flexors in patients with obliterating arteriopathy of the lower limbs (stage 2) and to evaluate fatigue.The comparison was based on two groups of ten patients: one with obliterating arteriopathy, and the second with healthy limbs as a control group. Each group of patients underwent bilateral plantar flexion and dorsiflexion of the ankle on an isokinetic machine, with the following movements: three series of five movements at 120 degrees/s, then three series of three movements at 30 degrees/s in a concentric mode to evaluate strength. The exercise was repeated 20 times at 180 degrees/s to evaluate fatigue. The isokinetic parameters selected were the couple peak and ratio of workload to total weight of the patient. Tests controlled for cardiac frequency, as measured by electrocardiography, and blood pressure.Patients with obliterating arteriopathy of the lower limbs were generally weaker in global strength of plantar and dorsal flexors and had greater muscular fatigue than the control group (P < 0.05).Decreased performance in the leg muscles in patients with obliterating arteriopathy of the lower limbs is likely due to arterial deficit. Muscular metabolism anomalies such dysfunction of the terminal stages of the oxidative phosphorylation could also affect strength. Use of isokinetics represents an interesting possibility for treatment of patients with multiple cardiovascular abnormalities.
