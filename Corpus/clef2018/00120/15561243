Hepatic venous stenosis in partial liver graft transplantation detected by color Doppler ultrasound before and after radiological interventional management. Hepatic outflow insufficiency remains one of the major complications causing postoperative graft failure especially among partial liver graft transplantations (PLT) including living donor liver transplantation (LDLT), reduced size liver transplantation (RLT), and split liver transplantation (SLT). These procedures are different from the whole liver graft transplantations (OLT), which include multiple vascular anastomoses. Color Doppler ultrasound (CDUS) was used to evaluate the hepatic venous outflow from grafts before and after radiological interventional management and to document treatment effects. From June 1994 to March 2003, our 136 cases of PLTs included 131 LDLTs, two RLTs, and three SLTs. Seven cases (six children and one adult) showed postoperative hepatic vein outflow obstruction and persistent massive ascites, as detected by color Doppler ultrasound (CDUS) and confirmed by interventional angiography. The CDUS showed a monophasic flat waveform with a relatively low hepatic vein average peak velocity (Va) in all cases (mean 11 cm/s). Successful interventional procedures included balloon dilatation in three cases and metallic stent replacement in four cases. CDUS was used with guidance during the procedure to confirm restoration of normal hepatic vein flow with a multiphasic waveform and an objective increase of average flow velocity (high to average 66 cm/s). Ascites disappeared dramatically after the procedure. In conclusion CDUS is the prime modality to diagnose and document a treatment response.
