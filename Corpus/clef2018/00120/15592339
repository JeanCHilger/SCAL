Exercise patterns and cardiovascular fitness of patients with peripheral arterial disease. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is characterized by walking impairment as the result of claudication, which is improved by exercise. Few studies have examined the impact of existing exercise patterns in community-dwelling patients with PAD on cardiovascular fitness and absolute claudication distance (ACD). This descriptive study examines exercise patterns, walking distance, and cardiovascular fitness in a sample of community-dwelling older adults with PAD. Approximately 50% of subjects reported walking 4 (+/-2) days per week for 38 +/- 24 minutes. ACD (exercisers = 459.9 +/- 272 non-exercisers = 351.2 +/- 266.3, P = .06) and initial claudication distance (exercisers = 198.5 +/- 139.7
