Endovascular treatment of carotid artery stenosis: retrospective study of 79 patients treated with stenting and angioplasty with and without cerebral protection devices. We evaluate the results of stenting and angioplasty on carotid bifurcation stenotic lesions using protection systems, emphasizing the indications and technical aspects. Seventy-nine patients, mean age 64.5 years were treated from February,1998 to March, 2003. All patients were included in NASCET study criteria. Forty three patients were treated without the protection systems and thirty six were treated with carotid protection filtering system (Angioguard, EPI). Technical success and 6-months carotid Doppler ultrasound follow-up showing stent patency were achieved in all patients. One major stroke and one death due to intracranial reperfusion bleeding occurred in patients treated without cerebral protection devices. Only one patient presenting hyper perfusion syndrome improving after 7 days, was found in the group treated with the cerebral protection filter mechanism, no other neurologic symptom or death occurred in this group. Stenting and angioplasty with protection systems for thromboembolic debris is a safe endovascular method to treat stenotic lesions in the carotid bifurcation with low morbidity and mortality.
