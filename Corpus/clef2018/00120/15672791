Resistive index measurement of native hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula feeding artery as a predictor for fistula dysfunction. The aim of the present study was to evaluate resistive index (RI) in the feeding artery of the functioning and dysfunctioning arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs). Measurement of RI in the feeding artery using Doppler ultrasound was performed in 48 patients on hemodialysis. Twenty-seven upper arm AVFs and 21 radiocephalic AVFs were studied. The patients were categorized into three groups according to clinical function: group 1, AVFs with normal function (n = 21) group 2, AVFs with abnormal clinical function (reduced pump flow) (n = 20)
