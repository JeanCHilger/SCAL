Relationship between lipid parameters and the presence of peripheral arterial disease in elderly patients. To investigate the relationship between various lipid parameters and the presence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD).Cross-sectional analysis of the observational epidemiological getABI study (German epidemiological trial on Ankle Brachial Index) with 6,880 unselected elderly patients in 344 primary care centers.In the multivariate analysis, the strength of the association between the various lipid parameters and PAD was found to be generally limited, when accounting for other risk factors.These findings are in contrast to previous studies. While lipid levels alone cannot be used for supporting the PAD diagnosis or the risk factor for these patients, this should not preclude PAD patients from receiving adequate lipid lowering treatment.
