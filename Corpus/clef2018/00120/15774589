Colour Doppler ultrasound mapping of chest wall lesions. Spectral curve-analysis of arterial flow signals (FS) in patients with pulmonary lesions is able to discriminate FS of bronchial arteries (BA) from FS of pulmonary arteries (PA). In patients with chest wall lesions a different FS from that of the BA/PA can be obtained. The aim of the study was to evaluate and characterize arterial supply of chest wall lesions using quantitative colour Doppler ultrasound (CDS). Between September 2002 and June 2003, 29 consecutive patients with chest wall lesions were examined by CDS. 16 lesions were located strictly to the chest wall (group I). 13 lesions had a chest wall lesion with pulmonary extension (group II). The following parameters were prospectively determined: (1) qualitative CDS (absence or evidence of vascularity) (2) quantitative CDS of intercostal or non-intercostal located arterial FS (resistive index (RI) and pulsatility index (PI))
