Percutaneous endovascular treatment for chronic limb ischemia. Percutaneous transluminal methods of revascularization for chronic limb ischemia have traditionally been used as an adjunctive or secondary mode of treatment. This study examines the outcomes of patients treated via endovascular methods as the primary form of treatment. The records of 66 patients (average age, 71.3 years range, 53 to 92) with chronic limb ischemia treated from November 2000 to January 2002 at a single institution with endovascular methods were retrospectively reviewed. Thirty-one patients had disabling claudication, 15 had rest pain, 17 had minor tissue loss, and 3 had major tissue loss. There were 94 lesions in the 66 limbs: 45 lesions in the superficial femoral artery, 28 lesions in the popliteal artery, and 21 lesions in tibial arteries. Occlusive lesions were treated by subintimal angioplasty. Stenoses were treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). The median length of the lesions was 12 cm. Forty-six stents were placed in 32 patients
