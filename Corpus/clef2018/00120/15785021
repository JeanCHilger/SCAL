Association of ankle-brachial index with severity of angiographic coronary artery disease in patients with peripheral arterial disease and coronary artery disease. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) was correlated with the severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) in 273 patients, mean age 71 years, with peripheral arterial disease and angiographically obstructive CAD (> 50% occlusion). Of 155 patients with an ABI < 0.40, 130 (84%) had 3- or 4-vessel CAD, 17 (11%) had 2-vessel CAD and 8 (5%) had 1-vessel CAD. Of 80 patients with an ABI of 0.40-0.69, 37 (46%) had 3- or 4-vessel CAD, 33 (41%) had 2-vessel CAD and 10 (13%) had 1-vessel CAD. Of 38 patients with an ABI of 0.70-0.89, 10 (26%) had 3- or 4-vessel CAD, 16 (42%) had 2-vessel CAD and 12 (32%) had 1-vessel CAD. The lower the ABI, the higher the prevalence of 3- or 4-vessel CAD and the lower the prevalence of 1-vessel CAD.
