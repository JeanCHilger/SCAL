Association between serum C-reactive protein levels and pulse wave velocity: a population-based cross-sectional study in a general population. Arterial stiffness as determined by aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) has been shown to predict cardiovascular events in high-risk subjects such as those with hypertension or end-stage renal disease. Although it is suspected that low-grade inflammation as represented by increased C-reactive protein (CRP) plays an important role in the progression of atherosclerosis, it is not yet known whether serum CRP levels are associated with PWV. To examine the relationship between brachial-ankle PWV (baPWV) and serum CRP levels, several cardiovascular risk factors including these two markers (baPWV and CRP) were measured in 870 participants (mean age 59 years) randomly selected from a general population. Age, male gender, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, diabetes, and serum CRP levels increased with the quartiles divided by baPWV (all, p<0.01). By multiple regression analysis, age (p<0.001), systolic blood pressure (p<0.001), heart rate (p<0.001), body mass index (p<0.001), and CRP (p<0.01) were significant and independent predictors for baPWV. In conclusion, this cross sectional study has demonstrated in the general population that the arterial stiffness marker baPWV was independently correlated with serum CRP levels after adjustment for other established cardiovascular risks factors. This result suggests that baPWV may be a surrogate marker for atherosclerotic vascular damages including an inflammatory component.
