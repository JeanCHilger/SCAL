ACE inhibition attenuates sympathetic coronary vasoconstriction in patients with coronary artery disease. In humans, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition attenuates the vasoconstriction induced by sympathetic stimulation in a number of peripheral districts. Whether this is also the case in the coronary circulation is unknown, however.In nine normotensive patients with angiographically assessed coronary atherosclerosis, we measured the changes in mean arterial pressure (intra-arterial catheter), heart rate, rate-pressure product (RPP), coronary sinus blood flow (CBF, thermodilution method), and coronary vascular resistance (CVR, ratio between mean arterial pressure and CBF) induced by the cold pressor test (CPT, 2 minutes) and diving (30 seconds), i.e., two stimuli eliciting a sympathetic coronary vasoconstriction. The measurements were performed in the control condition and 30 minutes after captopril 25 mg p.o. In the control condition, CPT caused an increase in mean arterial pressure and heart rate. Despite the increase in RPP (+20.7 +/- 3.2%, p less than 0.01), CBF did not change and CVR increased (+12.2 +/- 4.0%, p less than 0.05). diving caused an increase in mean arterial pressure and a reduction in heart rate. RPP increased (+14.3 +/- 3.5%, p less than 0.01), but despite this increase, there was a reduction in CBF and a marked increase in CVR (+37.3 +/- 7.4%, p less than 0.01). Captopril did not modify the blood pressure and heart rate responses to both stimuli except for a slight accentuation of the bradycardia to diving. Despite the unchanged or only slightly reduced RPP response, the increase in CVR was markedly and significantly attenuated (p less than 0.01).ACE inhibition attenuates sympathetic coronary vasoconstriction in patients with coronary artery disease. This is probably due to removal of the facilitating influence of angiotensin II on sympathetic modulation of coronary vasomotor tone.
