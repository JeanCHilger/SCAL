Posterior ponticles and rotational stenosis of vertebral arteries. A pilot study using Doppler ultrasound velocimetry and magnetic resonance angiography. To determine whether the presence of posterior ponticles markedly increases by 30% or more, the incidence of major rotational stenosis of vertebral arteries.Doppler ultrasound studies were performed in 3 private chiropractic clinics and in the radiology department of a public hospital, and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) studies were made in the latter location. Thirty-two chiropractic patients had Doppler velocimetery, and 16 of these patients had MRA scanning. The outcome measures included changes in Doppler velocimetry signals and MRA images indicative of marked rotational stenosis of vertebral arteries.All vertebral arteries from the 32 patients displayed no signs indicative of marked rotational stenosis.The findings of this study show that the incidence of major rotational stenosis of vertebral arteries is not markedly increased by the presence of posterior ponticles.
