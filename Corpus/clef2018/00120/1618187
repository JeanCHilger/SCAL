Aerobic endurance, anatomical factors and time properties of laser Doppler recorded skin postocclusive hyperaemia. Aerobic endurance capacity is partly dependent on blood supply to and metabolic capacity of the active muscles. Recordings of lower limb skin postocclusive hyperaemia with laser Doppler flowmetry can differentiate between patients with lower limb atherosclerosis and healthy controls. In this study, we investigated the relationship between aerobic endurance, calf volume, common femoral artery diameter and time properties of the postocclusive laser Doppler curve. A group of 16 healthy male subjects with values for aerobic endurance which varied from those of untrained men to elite endurance trained athletes were examined. Duration of laser Doppler recorded skin postocclusive hyperaemia was significantly correlated to both aerobic power and anaerobic threshold (P less than 0.01). Hyperaemia in subjects with large common femoral artery diameter was of shorter duration (P less than 0.05). The peak and mean body mass related blood flow during hyperaemia was correlated to anaerobic threshold (P less than 0.05). These results were in agreement with previous studies indicating an effect of endurance training on the blood supply to the muscles concerned.
