Early detection of atherosclerosis. According to the guidelines, the global assessment of cardiovascular risk is based on traditional risk factors. The emergence of new cardiovascular risk factors may be helpful. However, at every level of risk factor exposure, there is a substantial variation of atherosclerosis. Thus, subclinical disease measurements, representing the end result of risk exposure may be useful for improving cardiovascular risk prediction. In comparison to the ankle-brachial index, the high resolution B-mode ultrasound is a more promising tool to detect early atherosclerosis both on carotid and femoral arterial wall in asymptomatic patients. It appears as a new approach to predict the risk of cardiovascular disease and to monitor the cardiovascular therapy.
