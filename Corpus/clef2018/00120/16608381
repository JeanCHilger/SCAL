A randomised, controlled clinical trial evaluating changes in therapeutic efficacy and oxidative parameters after treatment with propionyl L-carnitine in patients with peripheral arterial disease requiring haemodialysis. We explored the efficacy of intravenous therapy with propionyl L-carnitine in patients with both peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and chronic renal insufficiency requiring haemodialysis.The trial was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Sixty-four patients on haemodialysis (32 per treatment arm) with chronic renal insufficiency and PAD were assigned to receive either intravenous propionyl L-carnitine 600 mg or placebo 3 times weekly for 12 months. The main outcome measures were the ankle/brachial index (ABI), plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) concentrations, and the plasma nitrite/nitrate ratio (NO(2)/NO(3)) these were measured at baseline and at 6 and 12 months.Significant increases in ABI were observed in the propionyl L-carnitine group, whereas in the placebo group the reverse trend was seen. In patients treated with propionyl L-carnitine, significant progressive decreases were seen in plasma MDA, 4-HNE and the NO(2)/NO(3) ratio from baseline. In the placebo-treated group, only weakly significant or no differences were seen.Intravenous administration of propionyl L-carnitine to haemodialysis patients with PAD improves both haemodynamic flow and the oxidative profile.
