The influence of the ipsilateral superficial femoral artery on iliac angioplasty. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of the ipsilateral superficial femoral artery (SFA) on percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of the iliac arteries. From 1993 to 2005, 183 iliac lesions (179 stenoses, 4 occlusions 37 common, 35 external, and 111 both iliac arteries) in 127 patients with disabling claudication [94 (52%)], rest pain [43 (23%)], and ulcer/gangrene [46 (25%)] were treated by PTA. TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) iliac lesion types were A in 48 limbs (26%), B in 92 (50%), C in 38 (21%), and D in 5 (3%). Stents were placed selectively for primary angioplasty failure [residual stenosis (>30%) or pressure gradient (>5 mm Hg)]. Seventy-seven limbs (42%) had patent SFAs (66 intact/<50% stenosis and 11 previously bypassed, pSFA group), 28 (15%) had stenotic SFAs (50-99%, sSFA group), 51 (28%) had occluded SFAs (oSFA group), and 27 (15%) had concomitant SFA angioplasty (aSFA group). The Society for Vascular Surgery and the International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery reporting standards were followed to define outcomes. There were no perioperative deaths. Total complication rate was 1.1% (2/183, groin hematomas). The mean follow-up was 20 months (range 1-115). One hundred twenty-five limbs (68%) had PTA alone for iliac lesions, and 58 (32%) had iliac stenting (a total of 91 stents). TASC iliac lesion types and the status of the ipsilateral profunda femoris artery were not significantly different among the four groups. Seventeen limbs (9%) had subsequent infrainguinal bypass: three in the pSFA, seven in the oSFA, four in the sSFA, and three in the aSFA groups (p = 0.19). The primary patency rate was significantly decreased in the sSFA group (29% at 3 years, Kaplan-Meier log-rank, p < 0.0001) compared with the other three groups
