Bilateral renal artery aneurysm: percutaneous treatment with stent-graft placement. A 51-year-old man with an 8-year history of hypertension (170/115 mmHg with two drugs) and altered renal function (5.6 mg/dl serum creatinine, 101 mg/dl BUN) was referred to our Department to evaluate the renal arteries and rule out renovascular hypertension. Doppler ultrasound and magnetic resonance angiography revealed significant bilateral renal artery stenosis and the presence of bilateral renal artery aneurysms. A self-expandable polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-covered nitinol stent-graft was deployed in each renal artery to treat the stenoses and to exclude the aneurysm. Postprocedural digital subtraction angiography confirmed the resolution of the renal artery stenoses and the complete exclusion of the aneurysms. At the 6 month follow-up, color Doppler confirmed normal patency of the renal arteries with complete exclusion of the aneurysms and significant reduction of the blood pressure (130/85 mmHg with one drug) and serum creatinine levels (2.1 mg/dl).
