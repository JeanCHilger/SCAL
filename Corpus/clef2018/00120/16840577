Venous smooth muscle tone and responsiveness in older adults. Venous compliance is lower in older adults compared with younger adults. It is possible that alterations in venous smooth muscle tone and responsiveness may contribute to the age-related differences in venous compliance. To determine the effects of sympathetic activation [cold pressor test (cold pressor test) rhythmic ischemic handgrip (rhythmic ischemic handgrip)] and endothelium-independent decreases in smooth muscle tone [sublingual nitroglycerin (nitroglycerin)] on venous compliance in young and older adults, forearm and calf venous compliance was measured in 12 young (22 +/- 1 yr) and 12 old (65 +/- 1 yr) supine subjects using venous occlusion plethysmography. Venous compliance was assessed at baseline, during the cold pressor test and rhythmic ischemic handgrip tests, and after nitroglycerin administration. All pressure-volume relationships were modeled with a quadratic regression equation, and beta1 and beta2 were used as indexes of venous compliance. A repeated-measures ANOVA was used to determine the effect of the age and trial on venous compliance. Calf regression parameters beta1 (0.0639 +/- 0.0126 vs. 0.0503 +/- 0.0059, young vs. older
