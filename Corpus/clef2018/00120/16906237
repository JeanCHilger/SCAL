Are the TASC recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of PAOD still relevant?. With regards to the rapid progress of interventional therapy in the treatment of PAOD the revision of the published guidelines (TASC Recommendations 2000) is more than necessary. The current options in therapy are modified constantly. Therefore, published recommendations might be not up-to-date. In consideration of the number of interventions and operations which are performed throughout Europe a trend towards less invasive treatment becomes apparent. Guidelines and recommendations from the Charing Cross and the ACC/AHA (ACC/AHA Guidelines for the Management of Patients With Peripheral Arterial Disease 2005) are reflecting this development. Regardless of the complexity of the planned procedure interventional treatment is almost always first choice therapy. A yearly revision of the actual guidelines would be useful, leading to an up-to-date modality. Although in the diagnostic pathway MRI and CTA gain more importance, the gold standard in diagnosis of PAOD remains the standardised measurement of the walking capacity, ankle-brachial index (ABI) and duplex ultrasound.
