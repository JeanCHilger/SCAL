Effect of iloprost on plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine and plasma and platelet serotonin in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Iloprost, a prostacyclin analogue, is used in the treatment of peripheral arterial occlusive disease at Leriche-Fontaine stages III-IV, through intravenous infusion for at least 21 days. Recently, iloprost has been shown to be safe and effective in critical limb ischemia patients when administered per 7 days. We investigated in patients at Leriche-Fontaine stages III-IV the effect of 1-week treatment with iloprost on plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), plasma and platelet serotonin, and on clinical response.Twenty-four critical limb ischemia patients (16 men and 8 women, mean age 76+/-9.7 years) were included in the study and treated with intravenous iloprost (titrated from 0.5 up to 1.5 ng/kg/min) for 16 h a day for seven consecutive days. Blood samples were drawn before infusion on days 1, 4 and 8 of treatment, under the same conditions. Clinical assessment was performed by clinical evaluation, ankle/brachial pressure index and treadmill exercise test. During treatment with iloprost patients clinically improved and plasma levels of ADMA significantly decreased (p<0.001). We also observed a significant increase of serotonin (p<0.01) in platelets and a significant decrease of serotonin (p<0.001) in plasma. Similar variations of ADMA and serotonin were found in two subgroups of patients, diabetics and non-diabetics.One-week treatment with iloprost in critical limb ischemia patients induced changes of peripheral markers of endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis, such as ADMA and serotonin, associated to a clinical improvement.
