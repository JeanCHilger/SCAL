Fibrinogen and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 level in peripheral arterial disease of type 2 diabetes patients. To determine association of fibrinogen and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in type 2 diabetes patients.This is a cross-sectional study with 52 type 2 diabetes patients of 41-74 years old. The subjects were divided into two groups, those who were diagnosed with PAD (16) and without PAD (36). Diagnosis of PAD was based on the ankle brachial index (ABI) measurement. Fibrinogen and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) level were evaluated as hemostatic factors. The two groups were compared for age, sex, smoking, plasma fasting glucose, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL), triglyceride concentrations, diabetes duration, systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure level. Statistical analyse were conducted to check the significance of differences between variables in the two groups as well as interrelationship between hemostatic factors and other parameters.Fibrinogen was similar in both group (402.42 +/- 74.44 mg/dl in PAD group and 322.45 +/- 101.05 mg/dl in non-PAD group) (p= 0.259). PAI-1 was also similar in both group (8.93 +/- 11.02 IU/ml in PAD group and 7.06 +/- 7.32 IU/ml in non-PAD group) (p=0.721). Hyperfibrinogenemia was more prevalent in PAD group (68.8%) than in non-PAD group (25%) (p= 0.005).Our data showed that fibrinogen and PAI-1 level were similar in both groups. As a risk factor hyperfibrinogenemia was more prevalent in PAD group.
