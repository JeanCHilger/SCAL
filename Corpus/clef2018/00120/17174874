Effective prevention of massive periprocedural embolism during renal artery stenting. We report the case of a massive embolism of atheromatous material during stenting of a tight renal artery stenosis, which was prevented by using a distal embolic protection device and aggressive aspiration of the blood through a guiding catheter. A 72-year-old man who was referred to our institution for coronary artery disease treated with coronary angioplasty underwent renal angiography which revealed a tight stenosis (99%) located at the ostium of the right renal artery extending for 15 mm into the main tract. The diameter of the artery was estimated to be 5.5 cm in the main tract, and the plaque had a soft appearance complicated by the presence of a thrombus (persistence of contrast agent in the plaque on selective renal angiography). Renal artery Doppler ultrasound and renal scintigraphy confirmed the need for renal revascularization. An embolus protection device (FilterWire EZ, Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA) was successfully opened distally to the stenosis after gentle predilation. After stent deployment (Genesis 5.5x18 mm, Cordis, J&J Medical, Miami Lakes, FL, USA), aggressive aspiration of the blood through the guiding catheter was performed. A large amount of embolic material with macroscopic particles was retrieved into the basket of the embolic protection device and in the blood aspirated with the guiding catheter. Good functional results were obtained on Doppler analysis of intrarenal blood flow, with a resistive index of 70. Despite the fact that the extensive use of embolic protection devices in renal artery stenting is still under discussion, this technique may be advisable in selected cases with favorable anatomy and high embolic risk, especially in patients with complex and hazy lesions.
