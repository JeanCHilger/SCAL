Complex non-invasive hemodynamic system for the evaluation of vascular status. The vascular diseases (myocardial infarct, stroke, peripheral occlusive disease) have a common pathophysiological background, the arteriosclerosis, that impairs the autoregulation of cerebral vessels, decreases the endothelium mediated flow in the peripheral vessels. Therefore the assessment of the vascular damage or the follow-up of therapy need a complex and simultaneous approach. Currently the morphological and functional changes in the vascular system can be investigated with separated measuring systems, focusing either to cardiac or cerebral parameters (intermittent blood pressure measurement, ECG, cerebral blood flow by transcranial Doppler e.g.). Our purpose is to establish a complex non-invasive system for the simultaneous measurement and comparison of cardiac/cerebral/peripheral hemodynamics. The hemodynamic parameters in hypertensive patients are examined with transcranial Doppler and cardiac monitoring during tilt-table test. Intima-media thickness, flow-mediated dilatation in brachial artery, augmentation index and pulse wave velocity are also measured. The measurement will be repeated after 6 and 12 months follow-up. Our preliminary results are similar to those found in the literature, that proves the reliability of our complex noninvasive hemodynamic system. It is assumed, that 12 months antihypertensive therapies with ACE inhibitors, calcium antagonist etc. might result in different effects on different vascular parameters. Our system enables the individualization of antihypertensive therapy.
