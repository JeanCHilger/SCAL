The effect of supervised exercise and cilostazol on coagulation and fibrinolysis in intermittent claudication: a randomized controlled trial. The prothrombotic, hypofibrinolytic state that develops in patients with intermittent claudication (IC) upon walking due to ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) of the leg muscles may contribute to the high incidence of life- and limb-threatening thrombotic events observed in this patient group. Treatments, such as angioplasty, that obtund the IRI also ameliorate the procoagulant diathesis. The effect on this diathesis of supervised exercise and cilostazol, both of which provide symptomatic benefit in IC, but without significantly obtunding IRI, is unknown.Thirty-four patients (27 men and 7 women median age, 67 yearsAt 6 months, when compared with receiving BMT only, supervised exercise and cilostazol resulted in improvements in ABPI of 18% and 13% and in ACD of 40% and 64%, respectively. The effects on ABPI and ACD of combining supervised exercise and cilostazol were additive. Supervised exercise, cilostazol, and supervised exercise combined with cilostazol had no significant effect on any of the four hemostatic markers.Treatment of IC by supervised exercise or cilostazol results in significant improvements in ABPI and ACD but has no demonstrable effect on the prothrombotic diathesis. This suggests that supervised exercise and cilostazol, unlike angioplasty, are unlikely to have a long-term beneficial effect on the thrombotic risks faced by these patients.
