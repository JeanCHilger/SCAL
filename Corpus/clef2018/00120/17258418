Endovascular treatment of isolated atherosclerotic lesions of the infrarenal aorta is technically feasible with acceptable long-term results. To investigate the results of endovascular treatment of symptomatic, atherosclerotic lesions of the infrarenal aorta.This is a retrospective study including 30 procedures performed on 25 patients in the period from 1990 through 2003. There were 16 women (64%) and 9 men, with a mean age of 55 years (range 35-81 years). The indication was disabling intermittent claudication in all cases. Preoperative assessment was done with ankle-arm pressure measurement and angiography. The mean length of the lesions was 2.5cm (range 1-6cm). One lesion was a short occlusion and nine were >90% stenoses. The remaining 20 lesions were significant (>70%) stenoses. The procedure was done with PTA alone in 13 cases, and with additional stenting in 17.The procedures were technically successful in 28 cases and clinically successful in all 30. In two cases, a >50% residual stenosis was not dilated further because of stretch pain. The mean observation time was 40 months (range 0-135 months). The primary 2 and 5 year patency rates calculated on basis of intention to treat were 90 and 77%. The primary assisted patency rate was 90% at 2 years and 83% at 5 years. Eight patients developed significant restenosis, of which five were treated with a new endovascular procedure. Two failures were treated conservatively and one with surgical thrombendarterectomy.Endovascular treatment of isolated atherosclerotic lesions of the infrarenal aorta is feasible in patients with suitable anatomy. Clinical success rates are high and long-term patency is good. Complications are few and minor. The majority of failures are amenable to new endovascular treatment.
