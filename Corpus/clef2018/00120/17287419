Plasma resistin levels correlate with determinants of the metabolic syndrome. The role of resistin in insulin sensitivity and obesity is controversial. Some authors suggest that increased serum resistin levels are associated with obesity, visceral fat, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and inflammation, while others failed to observe such correlations. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship of plasma resistin levels with markers of the metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis in a large population-based study.Plasma resistin levels were determined in 1090 subjects free of any medication selected from the PLIC study (designed to verify the presence of atherosclerotic lesions and progression intima-media thickness (IMT) in the common carotid artery in the general population) and related to the presence of obesity, metabolic syndrome, metabolic abnormalities, cardiovascular risk, and progression of IMT.Plasma resistin levels were highly positively correlated with triglycerides, waist circumference, waist/hip ratio, systolic blood pressure, and ApoAI/ApoB ratio, while they were inversely correlated with high density lipoprotein and ApoAI levels. This finding was gender specific (mainly in women). Plasma resistin levels were significantly higher in women with the metabolic syndrome compared with controls (4.90 (0.24) ng/ml vs 3.90 (0.11) ng/ml P<0.01), while no difference was observed in obese subjects. Finally, plasma resistin levels were significantly correlated with cardiovascular risk calculated according to the Framingham algorithm (P<0.01).Plasma resistin levels are increased in presence of the metabolic syndrome and are associated with increased cardiovascular risk.
