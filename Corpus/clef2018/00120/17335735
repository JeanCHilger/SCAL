Value of the ankle-brachial index in cardiovascular risk stratification of patients without known atherotrombotic disease. MERITO study. Peripheral arterial disease detected by measurement of ankle-brachial index enables the identification of asymptomatic patients with target organ damage. We have investigated the prevalence of peripheral arterial disease (ankle-brachial index < 0.9), and its potential clinical-therapeutic impact, in patients without known atherotrombotic disease from internal medicine practices.It was a multicenter, cross-sectional, observational study. Outpatients aged 50 through 80 years, with either diabetes or a SCORE risk estimation of at least 3%, were enrolled.A total of 1,519 subjects (58% men) were evaluated, 917 with diabetes (61%). The mean age (standard deviation) was 66.2 (8.3) years. The prevalence of an ankle-brachial index < 0.9 was 26.19%. In multiple logistic regressions the risk factors associated to an ankle-brachial index < 0.9 were age, sedentary lifestyle, smoking, macroalbuminuria, and heart rate. There was a significant relationship between the ankle-brachial index and the SCORE risk estimation. With respect to the therapeutic aims of the patients with an ankle-brachial index < 0.9, only 21% were taking antiplatelet drugs, 26% showed low density lipoproteins-cholesterol values < 100 mg/dl (53% < 130 mg/dl), and 16% displayed recommended blood pressure levels.Measurement of ankle-brachial is useful to reclassify as high risk a significant proportion of patients without known previous atherotrombotic disease. The ankle-brachial index should be incorporated into routine cardiovascular evaluation, particularly in subjects with diabetes or a score risk assessment > or = 3%.
