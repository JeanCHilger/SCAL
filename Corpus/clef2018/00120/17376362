New perspectives in the measurement of cardiovascular risk: explorations to detect subclinical atherosclerosis and inflammation markers. Among the new technologies for the detection of subclinical atherosclerosis, ankle-brachial index, carotid ultrasonography, computed tomography detection of coronary calcifications and high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance are those of greatest clinical usefulness. These explorations are especially useful for patients with an intermediate cardiovascular risk, or a 10-20% risk according to the National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult Treatment Panel III or 3-4% according to the SCORE project. This is because they allow the identification of high-risk patients who need a more intense treatment. In addition, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein concentrations may be considered as a new marker for the evaluation of cardiovascular risk. In this article, the current state of knowledge about these explorations and the guidelines of the main scientific societies are reviewed, and the practical conclusions of the working group are provided.
