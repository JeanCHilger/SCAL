Mechanical factors in arterial aging: a clinical perspective. The human arterial system in youth is beautifully designed for its role of receiving spurts of blood from the left ventricle and distributing this as steady flow through peripheral capillaries. Central to such design is "tuning" of the heart to arterial tree this minimizes aortic pressure fluctuations and confines flow pulsations to the larger arteries. With aging, repetitive pulsations (some 30 million/year) cause fatigue and fracture of elastin lamellae of central arteries, causing them to stiffen (and dilate), so that reflections return earlier to the heart
