Laser Doppler skin perfusion pressure in the diagnosis of limb ischemia in patients with diabetes mellitus and/or hemodialysis. We investigated whether measurement of skin perfusion pressure (SPP), as measured by laser Doppler, can be used to evaluate the severity of limb ischemia in diabetes mellitus (DM) and/or hemodialysis (HD) patients.From April 2004 to March 2005, the ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) and SPP were evaluated in 44 consecutive lower limbs with peripheral artery disease (PAD) and in 24 patients (21 males and 3 females, aged from 45 to 84 years, with a mean age of 69.3 years) with DM and/or HD. Twelve limbs were categorized as Fontaine stage II, 19 as Fontaine stage III and 24 as Fontaine stage IV.The SPP did not differ significantly between limbs at Fontaine stage II and those at Fontaine stage III, but it was significantly lower in limbs at Fontaine stage IV than in those at Fontaine stage II or III. The ABPI did not differ significantly among limbs at Fontaine stages II, III and IV.The SPP, as measured by the laser Doppler technique, may be used as a standard for classifying the severity of PAD in patients with DM and/or HD.
