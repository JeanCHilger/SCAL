The diagnosis of peripheral arterial embolism. Acute embolic occlusion of a peripheral artery requires rapid and precise diagnosis in order to provide the appropriate treatment without delay. The symptoms and findings of acute arterial occlusion are characterized by "the six Ps": pain of sudden onset in the hypoperfused extremity, paleness, pulselessness, paresthesias, paralysis and, in the extreme case, prostration with the symptoms of shock. With embolization in arterial segments with only minimal residual perfusion via collaterals (for example, the femoral bifurcation), a complete ischemic syndrome is usually incurred manifesting the six Ps as delineated. If preformed collateral systems provide some perfusion distal to an arterial occlusion (for example, in the common iliac artery), there is frequently an incomplete ischemic syndrome observed which is characterized by pain, paleness and pulselessness. Peripheral arterial embolism has a predilection for the femoral bifurcation, the superficial femoral artery and the popliteal artery. In principle, however, embolization can occur in every arterial segment. The diagnosis of the acute ischemic syndrome can generally be established on the basis of the history and physical examination. Diagnostic aid can be provided by electronic segmental oscillography to demonstrate diminished or absent oscillations and with the Doppler sonographically-determined systolic arterial pressure at the ankle which, in the case of severe ischemia, is less than 50 mmHg. Arteriography provides the most accurate morphological information. Abrupt occlusion of the vessel and no collateral perfusion especially in the absence of arteriosclerotic changes are strongly indicative of embolism but not conclusive. If the clinical diagnosis is unequivocal, arteriography need not be performed prior to embolectomy with a Fogarty catheter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
