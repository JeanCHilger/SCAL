Contribution of immunohistochemical detection of human herpesvirus-8 latent nuclear antigen-1 in the diagnosis of Kaposi disease. To study the immunohistochemical expression of HHV8 in Kaposi's lesions and in other vascular lesions and to determine the utility of this technique in differentiating between Kaposi's disease (KD) and other vascular lesions.Fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections from 25 cases of KD, 9 cases of hemangioma, 2 cases of angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia and 9 cases of angiosarcoma were examined immunohistochemically using the monoclonal antibody monoclonal LNA 53 (ABI). Strong, nuclear and granular staining in at least a cell was considered as a positive result.Sixteen cases of KD showed positive staining, whereas all cases of hemangioma, angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia and angiosarcoma were negative for this antigenImmunohistochemical detection of the human herpesvirus-8 latent nuclear antigen-1 is a useful for differentiating between KD and other vascular lesions.
