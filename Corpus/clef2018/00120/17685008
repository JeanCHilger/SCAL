Ischemic disease of lower extremities--risk factors and ultrasound diagnostic. We investigated 77 patients (61 men, 16 women) with clinical signs of PAOD, without previous arterial intervention, using the color dupplex sonography and angiography. An average age was 63.5 +/- 11 years. We followed the risk factors of the atherosclerosis (smoking, diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, hyperlipidemia and obesity) and almost 86% of the patients had multiple risk factors. We found significantly higher prevalence of smoking in men and higher prevalence of obesity in women. We found significantly higher occurrence of hemodynamicaly significant atherosclerotic changes in the infrapopliteal area in diabetic patients. Examination of the carotid arteries found pathologic IMT in 82% of the patients, what confirmed common simultaneous atherosclerotic changes of carotid and lower extremities arteries, even 5.2% of the patients had to undergo carotid endarterectomy due to the severe atherosclerotic changes. The average ABI value showed severe occlusion. We excluded diabetic patients with mediocalcinos from the ABI evaluation. We found significant correlation between IMT and ABI values. Comparing the angiography and dupplex sonography, we found 98% sensitivity and 100% specificity of dupplex sonography in a femoro-popliteal area, but significantly lower sensitivity and specificity in an infra-popliteal area (Tab. 1, Fig. 1, Ref 7) Full Text (Free, PDF) www.bmj.sk.
