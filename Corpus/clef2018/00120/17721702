Ultrasound- and Doppler-guided arthroscopic shaving to treat Jumper's knee: a technical note. Here we present a new technique for arthroscopic treatment of patellar tendinopthy-Jumper's knee, were arthroscopic shaving and Ultrasound + Doppler examination are performed simultaneously. Using this technique, the tendon and the areas with structural tendon changes and high blood flow are continuously demonstrated in the operating field. By this, the shaving procedure can be more exactly addressed to the area of interest on the dorsal surface of the tendon, and the trauma to the Hoffa fat pad and the tendon is minimized.
