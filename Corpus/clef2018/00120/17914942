Study of arteriosclerosis in patients with hiatal hernia and reflux esophagitis. It has been reported that the prevalence of hiatal hernia (HH) and reflux esophagitis (RE) increases with age, as does the degree of arteriosclerosis. However, it has not been investigated whether or not arteriosclerosis is correlated with the presence of HH and RE. Therefore, we prospectively investigated the degree of arteriosclerosis in patients with HH and RE compared with subjects without HH and RE.We prospectively enrolled 1683 people who visited Shimane Environment and Health Public Corporation for annual medical check-ups. All subjects were investigated by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for the possible presence of HH and RE. Factors used for assessing cardiovascular risk were sex, age, body mass index (BMI), smoking and drinking habits, serum total cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC). Arteriosclerosis was investigated by measuring systolic blood pressure, heart-carotid pulse wave velocity (HCPWV), bilateral ankle brachial index (ABI) and heart-ankle PWV (HAPWV).The number of patients with HH and RE was 624 (37.1%) and 143 (8.5%), respectively. The HDLC level of the patients with HH was significantly lower, and the levels of BMI, TG and arteriosclerotic parameters were higher than those of the subjects without HH after adjusting for confounding factors (sex, age and smoking and drinking habits). Cardiovascular and arteriosclerosis parameters except for TG did not differ between the subjects with and without RE.Levels of arteriosclerosis parameters in patients with HH were higher than in those without HH. However, the association between arteriosclerosis and presence of RE was not clarified.
