Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in treatment of lower limb peripheral arterial disease in diabetes patients: analysis of 150 cases. To analyze the technical success rate and short-term clinical results of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in treatment of lower limb peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in diabetes mellitus (DM) patients.150 consecutive DM patients PAD (176 limbs) with Fontaine degree I - IV were treated with PTA and followed up for 5 months (1 - 16 months). The result with the residual stenosis < 30% was regarded as success.Totally 187 PTA procedures were performed in 150 patients (176 limbs) with a technical success rate of 91.4% (161/176)). No serious complication occurred. The clinical symptoms of all patients improved after successful PTA. The median ankle-brachial index (ABI) marginally increased from the baseline value of 0.34 +/- 0.27 to 0.96 +/- 0.24 after intervention. The ABI levels 1 month and 6 months after PTA were 0.88 +/- 0.34 and 0.71 +/- 0.26 respectively. The cumulative restenosis rate was 13.7%, and the reintervention rate was 7.2%.With high success rate, low complication rate, and sure curative effect, PTA can be performed as the first choice in treatment of the lower limb PAD in DM patients.
