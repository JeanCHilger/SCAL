Cardio-ankle vascular index is a new noninvasive parameter of arterial stiffness. Beta is an index of arterial stiffness independent of blood pressure. Beta of the thoracic descending aorta (TDA) has been obtained by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and the cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) is a new noninvasive estimation of beta.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy and usefulness of CAVI and to compare it with other parameters of arteriosclerosis by carotid ultrasound (CU). The instantaneous dimensional change of the TDA on TEE was measured simultaneously with systemic pressure of the brachial artery in 70 patients in sinus rhythm. There were significant correlations between CAVI and age (r=0.65, p<0.01), and CAVI and the beta from TEE (Aobeta) (r=0.67, p<0.01). Next, 110 patients with chest pain syndrome underwent CU and measurement of CAVI, intima - media thickness (IMT), plaque score and beta. There were significant relationships between CAVI and IMT (r=0.42, p<0.01), and between CAVI and beta (r=0.39, p<0.01). CAVI of the group diagnosed with plaque was significant higher than that of the normal group (9.872+/-1.464 vs 9.038+/-1.377, p=0.0039).CAVI is measured easily and noninvasively and is a new index of arterial stiffness that is independent of blood pressure.
