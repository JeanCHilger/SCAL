Pseudo velocity profiles in carotid artery through Doppler US signal processing. In this paper a new method of obtaining hemodynamic information from spectral analysis of continuous wave Doppler ultrasound signals is presented. Some considerations of the evaluation of maximum and mean frequencies of the signal arising from scattering in the insonated volume are proposed. A new algorithm to compute the maximum frequency has been applied. Maximum and mean frequency are, respectively, proportional to the maximum and mean velocity in the insonated volume. Their application to mathematical models enables an estimate of velocity profiles into the vessels. The proposed method offers the possibility of matching an accurate evaluation of spectral broadening. In vitro tests and some clinical results involving healthy young people, arteriopathic and stenotic patients show the potential of the method in evaluating different hemodynamic conditions.
