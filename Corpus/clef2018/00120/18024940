Prevalence and risk factors of peripheral arterial disease in a selected Thai population. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a condition with high mortality, but it is amenable to secondary prevention. Data on its prevalence in Thailand are scarce. To study the prevalence of PAD in a middle-class, urban Thai population, a cross-sectional study was conducted at the Electric Generating Authority of Thailand's head plant, Nonthaburi, in 2002 and 2003 on all surviving and contactable employees and former employees who had participated in the first cardiovascular risk factors survey in 1985. Participants completed a structured questionnaire detailing their medical history, and they underwent a physical examination. A diagnosis of PAD was made when the ankle-brachial index (ABI) was < 0.9. Ankle-brachial index data were available for 98% of participants in the survey 75% were men, and participants' ages ranged from 52 to 73 years. The overall prevalence of PAD was 5.2%. The age-standardized prevalence of PAD was 4% in men and 9% in women. Multiple logistic regression analysis found hypertension (OR = 1.7), female gender (OR = 1.9), current smoking (OR = 3.0), current alcohol drinking (OR = 0.41), and overweight (body mass index [BMI] > 25 kg/m( 2), OR = 0.54) to be significant (P < .05) predictors of PAD. The prevalence of PAD in urban, middle-class Thais was similar to that in the population in developed countries.
