Prospective assessment of lower-extremity peripheral arterial disease in diabetic patients using a novel automated optical device. A new optical device based on the photoplethysmograph (PPG) method and an innovative algorithm for the assessment of lower-extremity peripheral arterial disease was investigated prospectively in patients with type II diabetes. This new functional PPG (fPPG) technique uses a cuffless functional test to assess diabetic peripheral arterial disease without operator dependency and the incompressible arteries, issues associated with ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) measurement. Diabetic patients (n = 24 47 legs
