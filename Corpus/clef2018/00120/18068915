Hormone therapy is associated with preserved smooth muscle structure and dilation in the arterial vasculature of the leg in older women. Long-term hormone therapy (HT) is associated with reduced intima-medial thickness (IMT), an established risk factor for atherosclerotic disease, in the femoral artery of healthy older women relative to age-matched non-hormone users. However, the influence of continuous, long-term HT on the relation between age, IMT, and smooth muscle dilation has not been investigated in the popliteal artery, an artery prone to stiffening and calcification. In the present study, popliteal artery IMT and smooth muscle dilation (the increase in diameter to sublingual nitroglycerin, NTG) were assessed with Doppler ultrasound in young (Y: n=16 age 23+/-1 [mean+/-S.E.M.]), older non-HT (O non-HT: n=14
