Biomarkers of inflammation and thrombosis as predictors of near-term mortality in patients with peripheral arterial disease: a cohort study. Traditional atherosclerotic risk factors predict long-term cardiovascular disease events but are poor predictors of near-term events.To determine whether elevated levels of D-dimer and biomarkers of inflammation were more closely associated with near-term than long-term mortality in patients with lower-extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and whether greater increases in biomarker levels were associated with higher mortality rates during the first year after the increase than during later years.Prospective cohort study with a mean follow-up of 3.4 years.Academic medical center.377 men and women with PAD.Mortality within 1 year after biomarker measurement, 1 to 2 years after biomarker measurement, and 2 to 3 years after biomarker measurement. Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate associations of biomarkers levels and changes in biomarkers with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Hazard ratios were calculated for each 1-unit increase in log1.5(biomarker level). Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, race, comorbid conditions, ankle-brachial index, and other confounders.Seventy-six patients (20%) died during follow-up. Higher levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and serum amyloid A were associated with higher all-cause mortality among patients who died within 1 year after biomarker measurement (hazard ratio, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.08 to 1.33], 1.13 [CI, 1.05 to 1.21], and 1.12 [CI, 1.04 to 1.20], respectively P < 0.001, P < 0.001, and P = 0.003) and among patients who died 1 to 2 years after biomarker measurement (hazard ratio, 1.14 [CI, 1.02 to 1.27], 1.15 [CI, 1.06 to 1.24], and 1.13 [CI, 1.04 to 1.24]The small number of deaths limited the statistical power of the analyses.Among persons with PAD, circulating levels of D-dimer and inflammatory markers are higher in the 1 to 2 years before death than in periods more remote from death. Increasing levels of D-dimer and inflammatory biomarkers are independently associated with higher mortality in persons with PAD.
