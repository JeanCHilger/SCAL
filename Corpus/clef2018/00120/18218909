Neurovascular responses to mental stress in the supine and upright postures. The purpose of this study was to determine neurovascular responses to mental stress (MS) in the supine and upright postures. MS was elicited in 23 subjects (26 +/- 1 yr) by 5 min of mental arithmetic. In study 1 (n = 9), Doppler ultrasound was used to measure mean blood flow velocity in the renal (RBFV) and superior mesenteric arteries (SMBFV), and venous occlusion plethysmography was used to measure forearm blood flow (FBF). In study 2 (n = 14), leg blood flow (LBF n = 9) was measured by Doppler ultrasound, and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA
