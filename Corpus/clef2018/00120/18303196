Intima-media thickness and pulse wave velocity in hypertensive adolescents. Increased intima-media thickness (IMT) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) are noninvasive markers of early arterial wall alteration and are more widely used in adult clinical research. We investigated whether IMT and PWV are useful predictors of cardiovascular risk in hypertensive adolescents. Fifteen hypertensive adolescents (13-18 yr old, systolic BP > or = 140 mmHg, diastolic BP > or = 90 mmHg) and seventeen normotensive subjects were included. Height, weight, obesity index, body mass index (BMI), and fat distribution were obtained from each group. Serum lipid, insulin, vitamine B12, folate, renin, aldosterone, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and homocysteine levels were compared. The carotid IMT and PWV were measured. Arterial wall compliance and distensibility were calculated with the equation. High systolic blood pressure significantly correlated with height, weight, BMI, obesity index, arm circumference, fat mass, and fat distribution. Hypertensive adolescents had significantly greater cIMT (carotid intima-media thickness) and lower elastic properties such as cross-sectional compliance and distensibility of the carotid artery. The carotid IMT significantly correlated with brachial-ankle PWV. In conclusion, the measurement of carotid IMT and brachial-ankle PWV might be useful to predict the development of atherosclerosis in hypertensive adolescents.
