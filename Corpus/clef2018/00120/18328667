Endogenous heparin activity is decreased in peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Naturally occurring heparin-like activity in the form of endogenous heparin and heparin sulfate proteoglycans has been shown in normal human plasma. Exogenous low-dose heparin improves pain-free walking distance and maximum walking distance in peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD). Is reduced endogenous heparin activity responsible for some of the problems found in PAOD? This study compared heparin-like activity in patients with PAOD with that in healthy subjects and explored its relationship to disease severity.In part 1, native and heparinase-modified thromboelastography was performed on peripheral venous blood samples in three groups of patients to measure heparin-like anticoagulant activity. Group 1: 15 control subjects (median age, 60 years range, 49-74 yearsIn part 1, all patients with PAOD had a significant increase in coagulability compared with controls. Heparinase-modified thromboelastography in controls showed a significant decrease in the latent period between placing the sample in the analyser, where it is recalcified, to the initial fibrin formation (DeltaR time P = .002) compared with native TEG, confirming endogenous heparin-like activity. Using DeltaR time as a measure of heparin-like activity, a significant reduction was found in patients with claudication (0.33 minutesPatients with PAOD have reduced endogenous heparin-like activity that correlates with disease severity.
