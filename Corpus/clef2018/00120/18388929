Therapeutic angiogenesis with intramuscular NV1FGF improves amputation-free survival in patients with critical limb ischemia. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of intramuscular administration of NV1FGF, a plasmid-based angiogenic gene delivery system for local expression of fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF-1), versus placebo, in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI). In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, European, multinational study, 125 patients in whom revascularization was not considered to be a suitable option, presenting with nonhealing ulcer(s), were randomized to receive eight intramuscular injections of placebo or 2.5 ml of NV1FGF at 0.2 mg/ml on days 1, 15, 30, and 45 (total 16 mg: 4 x 4 mg). The primary end point was occurrence of complete healing of at least one ulcer in the treated limb at week 25. Secondary end points included ankle brachial index (ABI), amputation, and death. There were 107 patients eligible for evaluation. Improvements in ulcer healing were similar for use of NV1FGF (19.6%) and placebo (14.3% P = 0.514). However, the use of NV1FGF significantly reduced (by twofold) the risk of all amputations [hazard ratio (HR) 0.498
