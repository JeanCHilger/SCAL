Hemosuccus pancreaticus. In this study, authors describe a rare case of a 40-year old patient with a history of chronic pancreatitis due to ethanol abuse, repeatedly hospitalized for intermittent bleeding into gastrointestinal tract (GIT). The sources of bleeding were pseudoaneurysms of the peripancreatic arteries (gastroduodenal artery, right hepatic artery) bleeding into GIT via pancreatic duct. This type of bleeding is referred as hemosuccus pancreaticus and belongs to a rare form of bleeding into upper GIT. Development of each pseudoaneurysm was monitored with a 6 month time interval. The diagnosis was established using endoscope, Doppler ultrasound and CT angiography. During the therapeutic process, while stopping bleeding, two different radiological interventions were used. In pseudoaneurysm of gastroduodenal artery, hemostasis was achieved using selective transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) with steel coils. In the second intervention, a stent was inserted into vascular lesion. In the discussion, authors review the problems of hemosuccus pancreaticus, epidemiology, symptoms, diagnostic and possible therapeutic approaches (Fig. 3, Ref. 31). Full Text (Free, PDF) www.bmj.sk.
