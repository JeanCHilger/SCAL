Central arterial pressure and importance of its examinations in pulmonology. Arterial pressure (AP) measured on brachial artery now cannot be considered as an unique marker of vascular tonus. According to literature data, more informative and prognostically valued parameters are central AP (CAP) and indices of arterial rigidity, which closer bound with hypertrophy of vascular wall, intensity of vascular atherosclerotic lesion and occurrence of cardiovascular complications, than peripheral AP and some other classic risk factors. Nevertheless, CAP measuring cannot be considered as alternative to classic method of AP measuring on brachial artery it only supplements our view of concrete pathological process. Non-invasive CAP measuring at diseases of respiratory organs can be usable for more precise assessment of cardiovascular risk at chronic and acute forms of diseases of pulmonary organs (DPO). The highest risk of CAP increase and cardiovascular complications take place in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), aggravation of severe bronchial asthma and in hypertensive patients with pneumonia or aggravation of chronic DPO. Results of CAP measuring can be used as additional diagnostic criteria of stratification of DPO and their complications risk. Early diagnostics of CAP disturbances (aortal hyper- o hypotension) make possible to correct therapy and prevent unfavorable consequences of hemodynamic disturbances. Dynamic control of CAP is reasonable to use for correction of therapeutic programs in departments of intensive care.
