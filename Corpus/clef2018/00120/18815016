Using brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity to associate arterial stiffness with cardiovascular risks. This study aimed to elucidate the relationship between brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) and conventional cardiovascular risk factors.A total of 192 subjects with low to intermediate risk was enrolled in a cardiovascular evaluation program. A multiple regression model was built to find significant cardiovascular biomarkers for predicting baPWV. A logistic regression model was developed to associate baPWV and other biomarkers with the risk of cardiac diastolic dysfunction. A total of 123 men (mean age: 52.6+/-12.0) and 69 women (mean age: 51.7+/-10.4) was included. Age, blood pressure, C-reactive protein, serum homocysteine, heart rate, and blood urea nitrogen were positively predictive of increased pulse wave velocity. In turn, baPWV increased the risk (odds ratio: 1.257 for each m/s, 95% CI: 1.105 approximately 1.430, p<0.001) and high-density lipoprotein decreased the risk for cardiac diastolic dysfunction (0.962 for each mg/dl, 95% CI: 0.925 approximately 1.000, p=0.05). The correlation between baPWV and Framingham 10-year risk was moderate (men: r=0.306, p=0.002 women r=0.548, p<0.001).The results suggest that baPWV is a composite risk factor for early atherosclerotic change and a predictor for the development of diastolic dysfunction and long-term cardiovascular risk.
