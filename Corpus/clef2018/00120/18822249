Management of a diabetic foot ulcer. A chronic diabetic foot ulcer requires a search for the etiology. The three main causes to search for are poor off-loading compliance, osteomyelitis, and peripheral vascular disease. The level of severity is measured with the U.T. classification and the level of infection with the classification of the International Consensus on the Diabetic Foot. Peripheral vascular disease must be precisely evaluated by Doppler ultrasound, which describes all the arteries of the lower limb. Angiography is required only in case of revascularization. Treatment of the ulcer includes strict off-loading, topical treatment, optimal treatment of hyperglycemia, and antibiotic therapy on a case-by-case basis for osteomyelitis and/or, angioplasty or by-pass procedures. Osteomyelitis can be treated by associating conservative surgery, antibiotic therapy, and off-loading. No amputation, even of one toe, must be done without a previous vascular check-up. Off-loading of the ulcer must be regularly checked. Poor off-loading compliance must be systematically investigated if the ulcer worsens or healing is delayed.
