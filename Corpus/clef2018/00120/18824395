The use of osteopathic manipulative treatment as adjuvant therapy in patients with peripheral arterial disease. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis associated with impaired endothelial function and intermittent claudication is the hallmark symptom. Hypothesizing that osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) may represent a non-pharmacological therapeutic option in PAD, we examined endothelial function and lifestyle modifications in 15 intermittent claudication patients receiving osteopathic treatment (OMT group) and 15 intermittent claudication patients matched for age, sex and medical treatment (control group). Compared to the control group, the OMT group had a significant increase in brachial flow-mediated vasodilation, ankle/brachial pressure index, treadmill testing and physical health component of life quality (all p<0.05) from the beginning to the end of the study. At univariate analysis in the OMT group there was a negative correlation between changes in brachial flow-mediated vasodilation and IL-6 levels (r=-0.30 p=0.04) and a positive one between claudication pain time and physical function score (r=0.50
