A modified suture technique produces consistent cerebral infarction in rats. Intraluminal occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) is used extensively in cerebral ischemia research. We tested a modified nylon suture in a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) under two anesthesia regimens. Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into six groups (Group 1, Poly-L-lysine-coated suture under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia Group 2, modified suture under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia
