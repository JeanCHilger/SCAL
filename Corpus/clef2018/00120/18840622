High-sensitivity C-reactive protein is not independently associated with peripheral subclinical atherosclerosis. This study investigated whether high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels are independently associated with subclinical peripheral atherosclerosis.Clinical variables, cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, 10-year CV risk, the ankle-brachial Index (ABI), and the carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) were determined in a sample of consecutive subjects free from previous CV disease, admitted for a first visit at a lipid clinic.In the overall sample (320 subjects, mean age 63 years, 35.8% men), hs-CRP levels were associated with major CV risk factors, 10-year CV risk, lower ABI, and higher cIMT values. In a logistic model, after adjustment for significant covariates, the associations of hs-CRP levels with ABI and cIMT were no longer statistically significant.Among asymptomatic, moderate- to-high CV risk subjects, hs-CRP levels were associated with severity of peripheral atherosclerosis, but these associations were not independent of traditional CV risk factors, suggesting a limited predictive role of hs-CRP for subclinical atherosclerosis.
