Physical activity during daily life and circulating biomarker levels in patients with peripheral arterial disease. Higher levels of inflammation are associated with adverse outcomes in patients with lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD). This study evaluated associations of physical activity during daily life with levels of inflammatory biomarkers, D-dimer, and homocysteine in patients with PAD. Participants were 244 men and women (mean age 74.4 +/- 8.2 years) with PAD (ankle brachial index <0.90). C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1, soluble vascular cellular adhesion molecule-1, D-dimer, and homocysteine were assessed at study entry. Physical activity was objectively assessed with a vertical accelerometer, which participants wore continuously for 7 days. After adjusting for age, gender, race, body mass index, smoking, co-morbidities, ankle brachial index, and other potential confounders, higher physical activity levels were associated linearly and significantly with lower levels of all measured circulating biomarkers: soluble vascular cellular adhesion molecule-1 (p trend = 0.001), D-dimer (p trend = 0.005), homocysteine (p trend = 0.006), interleukin-6 (p trend = 0.010), C-reactive protein (p trend = 0.028), and soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (p trend = 0.033). In conclusion, higher levels of physical activity were associated independently with lower levels of inflammatory markers, homocysteine, and D-dimer in patients with PAD.
