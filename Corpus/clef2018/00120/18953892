Clinical features of hypoperfusion retinopathy induced neovascular glaucoma. To analyze the clinical features of hypoperfusion retinopathy induced neovascular glaucomaThis retrospective case series included 18 cases (18 eyes) with hypoperfusion retinopathy induced neovascular glaucoma Among them, there were 15 male and 3 female 10 right eye and 5 left eye. The average age was 40-year-old (ranged from 18- to 78-year-old). Visual acuity and fundus were examined using fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA), Color Doppler Flow Imaging (CDFI), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) etc in all patients.The visual acuity was ranged from light perception to 0. 8 in all patients. The clinical features in hypoperfusion retinopathy induced neovascular glaucoma were characterized by midperipheral intraretinal hemorrhages, narrowed retinal arteries, dilated retinal veins, neovascularisation in iris and anterior chamber angle, ocular hypertension, excavation and atrophy of optic disk, and visual field defects when glaucoma progressed. All eyes have either ipsilateral common carotid artery obstruction or severe bilateral obstruction of the internal carotid arteries.Neovascular glaucoma is a rare and severe complication of hypoperfusion retinopathy associated with either ipsilateral common carotid artery obstruction or severe bilateral obstruction of the internal carotid arteries. Fundus degeneration is commonly involved in one eye. The characteristic clinical features are presented during the process of the disease.
