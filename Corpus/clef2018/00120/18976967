An evaluation of ureteral flow after doppler-guided uterine artery occlusion device placement during organ-preserving gynecologic procedures. We studied the use of color Doppler ultrasonography for ureteral patency after placement of a transvaginal Doppler-guided uterine artery occlusion device before organ-preserving surgery for leiomyomata uteri. Our case series involved 7 patients in whom ureteral flow was assessed using color Doppler sonography before and after placement of a Doppler-guided uterine artery occlusion device. Bilateral ureteral flow was assessed at the trigone using a grading system. Furosemide and additional intravenous hydration were administered if no flow was observed. Color Doppler ultrasonography can quantify ureteral flow before and after Doppler-guided uterine artery occlusion device placement during organ-preserving gynecologic procedures, facilitating safe placement and repositioning of the transvaginal device when necessary.
