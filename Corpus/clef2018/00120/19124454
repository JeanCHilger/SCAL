Angio-Seal use in patients with peripheral arterial disease (ASPIRE). To investigate the incidence of complications after the use of an arterial closure device (Angio-Seal) in patients with peripheral arterial disease.In 105 consecutive patients after transfemoral catheterization, the puncture site was closed using a closure device (Angio-Seal). Colour-flow-duplexsonography studies were conducted 1 to 4 days before, within 3 days after and 3 month after the intervention.All patients had peripheral arterial disease, 34 had calcification at the puncture site. Detection of calcification did not prevent device deployment. Complications (2 minor bleedings, 1 pseudoaneurysm) were not associated with high risk groups (these were: 69 antegrade punctures, 22 obese and 32 hypertensive patients). Three-month postinterventional diameter and blood velocity changes were <1%.Patients with peripheral arterial disease in the region of the puncture site and patients at higher complication risk can safely and effectively be closed with an Angio-Seal device. At the puncture site, no lumen change can be observed 3 months postinterventional.
