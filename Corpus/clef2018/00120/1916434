Continuous and pulsed Doppler in the examination of arterial circulation in the extremities. The authors present their experience in the investigation of arterial circulation by continuous and pulsed Doppler. The results obtained by Doppler's method were correlated with other noninvesive methods and arteriography. Arteriographic findings were scored by Bollinger method. A statistically significant difference of the flow and systolic pressure values was found between angiographically normal subjects and those with single and multiple lesions. The authors conclude that ankle flow and systolic index measurements, obtained by Doppler technique, are influenced by the degree, extensiveness and localisation of arteriosclerotic lesions on the lower limb arteries. The method was successfully applied in the control of the effects of medicamentous and surgical therapy.
