The subendothelial extracellular matrix modulates JNK activation by flow. Atherosclerosis begins as local inflammation of artery walls at sites of disturbed flow. JNK (c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase) is thought to be among the major regulators of flow-dependent inflammatory gene expression in endothelial cells in atherosclerosis. We now show that JNK activation by both onset of laminar flow and long-term oscillatory flow is matrix-specific, with enhanced activation on fibronectin compared to basement membrane protein or collagen. Flow-induced JNK activation on fibronectin requires new integrin ligation and requires both the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase MKK4 and p21-activated kinase. In vivo, JNK activation at sites of early atherogenesis correlates with the deposition of fibronectin. Inhibiting p21-activated kinase reduces JNK activation in atheroprone regions of the vasculature in vivo. These results identify JNK as a matrix-specific, flow-activated inflammatory event. Together with other studies, these data elucidate a network of matrix-specific pathways that determine inflammatory events in response to fluid shear stress.
