Diabetic nephropathy and risk factors for peripheral artery disease in Chinese with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The risk for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is increased in patients with chronic kidney disease. We investigated the effects of renal function on PAD in Chinese with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study enrolled a total of 2983 (1342 men and 1641 women) Chinese adults with diabetes. The mean age was 63.2 +/- 11.9 years. Peripheral arterial disease was diagnosed by an ankle-brachial index less than 0.9. Renal function was evaluated by serum creatinine (SCr), estimated glomerular filtration rate, and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR). Risk factors for PAD were evaluated using multiple logistic regression analysis. Age, cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (inverse association) were significant risk factors in men, whereas age, body mass index (inverse association), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and HDL-C (inverse association) were significant risk factors for diabetic women. After adjustment for age, body mass index, blood pressure, glycosylated hemoglobin, cholesterol, HDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels, we found that SCr levels greater than 1.5 mg/dL, estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min, and urinary ACR greater than 30 mg/g were independent risk factors for PAD in diabetic men and that SCr levels greater than 1.4 mg/dL and urinary ACR greater than 30 mg/g were independently associated with PAD in diabetic women. The risk factors for PAD are somewhat different between men and women with diabetes in Chinese population in Taiwan. Diabetic nephropathy is significantly associated with PAD in this patient population.
