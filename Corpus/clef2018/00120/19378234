Acute renal failure as atypical complication of atrial fibrillation. We present a case of a 76-year-old woman with persistent atrial fibrillation, recent diagnosis of ischemic stroke and embolic occlusion of the iliac artery, who was admitted to our department with symptoms of acute renal failure. Using the data from medical history, physical examination, ECG, laboratory tests (urinalysis, LDH in serum and urine) and radiologic studies (color Doppler ultrasound, angio-CT) we diagnosed renal artery embolus and infarct of solitary functioning kidney. We presumed that this complication was related to the inadequate anticoagulation in the course of atrial fibrillation. Patient received intravenous heparin followed by oral warfarin and started renal replacement therapy.
