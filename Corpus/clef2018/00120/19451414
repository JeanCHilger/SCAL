Prolactin and preclinical atherosclerosis in menopausal women with cardiovascular risk factors. Hyperprolactinemia has been associated with endothelial dysfunction and an adverse cardiovascular risk profile, possibly as a result of the vasoconstrictive properties of prolactin. In this cross-sectional study, we examined the hypothesis that prolactin contributes to the increased cardiovascular risk occurring in early menopause by studying apparently healthy women without hyperprolactinemia. Prolactin serum levels were measured by immunoassay in 76 women aged 54.4+/-4.9 years in menopause for 4.9+/-2.8 years, and possible correlations with traditional cardiovascular risk factors and surrogate markers of preclinical atherosclerosis, arterial stiffening, and endothelial and microcirculatory function were examined. Positive correlations between prolactin serum levels and arterial blood pressure, but no other traditional risk factors, were found. Prolactin also correlated with central aortic systolic (r=0.337 P=0.002) and diastolic (r=0.272
