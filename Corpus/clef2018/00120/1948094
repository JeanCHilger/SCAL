A double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled, dose comparison study of orally administered defibrotide: preliminary results in patients with peripheral arterial disease. Defibrotide is a polydeoxyribonucleotide drug known to modulate the endothelial cell release of t-PA, PAI, and PGI-2 and to improve blood flow and perfusion. A double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled, dose comparison study was carried out to test the long-term efficacy and safety of defibrotide in patients with PAD (Leriche stage 2). Informed patients suffering from PAD were enrolled, and after a 15-day washout period were randomly allocated in a double-blind fashion to one of the three following treatments: defibrotide 400 mg (1 cps) b.i.d. for 6 months, defibrotide 400 mg o.d., or placebo. Absolute walking distance (AWD, treadmill) and ankle-arm pressure ratio (Winsor Index, WI) were evaluated at the beginning and after 30, 90, and 180 days after therapy. Two hundred twenty seven patients were recruited and 193 patients were included in the final analysis (800 mg: 67 400 mg: 60
