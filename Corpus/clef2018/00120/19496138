Right common iliac aneurysm by peripheral computed tomographic angiography. This is a 77-year-old diabetic woman with history of claudication (Rutherford Category 2). Due to fear of underestimating disease with ankle-brachial index in a person with diabetes and advancing age, a CT angiogram was performed. The right common iliac artery had aneurysmal disease (3.4 cm) and a thrombus of right internal iliac artery. There was also a 40% stenosis of right external iliac artery and a left subtotal internal iliac stenosis at the origin. Given it's non-invasive nature and high diagnostic accuracy, CTA is poised to become the noninvasive test of choice in patients with suspected PAD or in patients at risk for obstructive vascular disease.
