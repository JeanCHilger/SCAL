Hepatic lipase promoter C-480T polymorphism is associated with serum lipids levels, but not subclinical atherosclerosis: the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study. The common C-480T polymorphism (rs1800588) of the hepatic lipase gene (LIPC) has been associated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, atherosclerosis, and coronary artery disease. In this study, we examined whether the polymorphism is associated with serum lipid and lipoprotein concentrations, as well as with subclinical atherosclerosis in Young Finns. The participants comprised 2041 men and women (aged 24-39 years) enrolled in the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study with complete data concerning the rs1800588 polymorphism and serum lipids concentration. All participants underwent an ultrasound examination for brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD) and carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) measurement. The marker of arterial elasticity, carotid artery compliance (CAC), was also calculated by means of ultrasound and concomitant brachial blood pressure measurements. In all subjects, serum total cholesterol (p < 0.001), HDL cholesterol (p = 0.006), apolipoprotein AI (apoAI, p < 0.001), and triglyceride (p = 0.009) concentrations increased according to rs1800588 genotype in the order CC, CT, and TT. The same order applied only to apoAI after adjustment for age, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, diabetes, hypertension, contraceptive hormone use in women, and concentrations of glucose, insulin and C-reactive protein in men and women separately (p = 0.007 and p = 0.003, respectively). The polymorphism was also associated with HDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, and triglyceride levels in women (adjusted p = 0.004, p = 0.007 and 0.02, respectively), but not in men (p was not significant for all). No significant association between the rs1800588 and brachial FMD, carotid IMT, or CAC was found among the entire study population or among women or men separately, with or without adjustment for the above-mentioned factors. The rs1800588 is associated with serum lipid and apolipoprotein concentrations, especially in women, but does not seem to be a determinant of brachial artery FMD, carotid IMT, or CAC in young healthy adults.
