The prevalence of polyvascular disease in patients referred for peripheral arterial disease. To objectively assess the presence of polyvascular disease in patients with peripheral arterial disease and its relation to inflammation and clinical risk factors.A total of 431 vascular surgery patients (mean age 68 years, men 77%) with atherosclerotic disease were enrolled. The presence of atherosclerosis was assessed using ultrasonography. Affected territories were defined as: (1) carotid, stenosis of common or internal carotid artery of >or=50%, (2) cardiac, left ventricular wall motion abnormalities, (3) abdominal aorta, diameter >or=30 mm and (4) lower limb, ankle-brachial pressure index <0.9. Cardiovascular risk factors and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels were noted in all.One vascular territory was affected in 29% of the patients, whereas polyvascular disease was found in 71%: two affected territories in 45%, three in 23% and four in 3% of patients. Levels of hs-CRP increased with the number of affected vascular territories (p<0.001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed age >or=70 years, male gender, body mass index (BMI)>or=25 kg m(-2), and hs-CRP to be independently associated with polyvascular disease.Polyvascular disease is a common condition in patients who have undergone vascular surgery. The level of systemic inflammation, reflected by hs-CRP levels, is moderately associated with the extent of polyvascular disease.
