Physical activity during daily life and brachial artery flow-mediated dilation in peripheral arterial disease. We determined whether higher levels of physical activity in daily life are associated with better brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) among individuals with lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Participants were 111 men and women with PAD (ankle-brachial index (ABI) <or= 0.95) who completed baseline testing in the Study to Improve Leg Circulation (SILC). We evaluated FMD of the brachial artery at baseline and at 60 seconds following 4 minutes of suprasystolic blood pressure cuff inflation. Physical activity was measured continuously over 7 days using a vertical accelerometer (Caltrac) and a pedometer (Digiwalker). Adjusting for age, sex, race, ABI, cardiovascular risk factors and other potential confounders, higher levels of physical activity were associated with a greater percent change in brachial artery FMD at 60 seconds post cuff deflation for both Caltrac (1st tertile of activity +4.81% change 2nd tertile +4.60% change
