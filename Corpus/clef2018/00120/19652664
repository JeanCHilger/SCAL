Common polymorphisms in CYP2C9, subclinical atherosclerosis and risk of ischemic vascular disease in 52,000 individuals. Cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) enzymes metabolize warfarin and arachidonic acid. We hypothesized that the CYP2C9(*)2 (rs.1799853) and CYP2C9(*)3 (rs.1057910) polymorphisms with decreased enzyme activity affect risk of subclinical atherosclerosis (reduced ankle brachial index and increased C-reactive protein), ischemic vascular diseases (ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, ischemic cerebrovascular disease and ischemic stroke) and death after an ischemic heart disease diagnosis. We genotyped the Copenhagen City Heart Study, a prospective study including 10 398 participants with 30-32 years of follow-up the Copenhagen General Population Study, a cross-sectional study including 21 629 participants
