Interstitial administration of platelet-enriched autoplasma (PEA) in treatment of lower limb ischaemia. Along with reconstructive operations, stimulation of neoangiogenesis is one of the methods of treatment for patients suffering from chronic obliterating diseases of arteries of the lower extremities. Cellular transplantation for these purposes has been used in clinical practice only during the last several years. However, the problem concerning an optimal type of cellular material still remains to be solved. The authors carried out comparison between administration of platelet-enriched autoplasma (PEA) in order to stimulate neoangiogenesis and the use of autologous blood according to the Bytok technique. It was demonstrated that judging by such parameters as an increased distance of pain-free walking and an increase in the ankle-brachial index six months after surgery, the use of PEA turned out more efficient.
