The AMC linear disability score (ALDS): a cross-sectional study with a new generic instrument to measure disability applied to patients with peripheral arterial disease. The AMC Linear Disability Score (ALDS) is a calibrated generic itembank to measure the level of physical disability in patients with chronic diseases. The ALDS has already been validated in different patient populations suffering from chronic diseases. The aim of this study was to assess the clinimetric properties of the ALDS in patients with peripheral arterial disease.Patients with intermittent claudication (IC) and critical limb ischemia (CLI) presenting from January 2007 through November 2007 were included. Risk factors for atherosclerosis, ankle/brachial index and toe pressure, the Vascular Quality of Life Questionnaire (VascuQol), and the ALDS were recorded. To compare ALDS and VascuQol scores between the two patient groups, an unpaired t-test was used. Correlations were determined between VascuQol, ALDS and pressure measurements.Sixty-two patients were included (44 male, mean +/- sd age was 68 +/- 11 years) with IC (n = 26) and CLI (n = 36). The average ALDS was significantly higher in patients with IC (80, +/- 10) compared to patients with CLI (64, +/- 18). Internal reliability consistency of the ALDS expressed as Cronbach's alpha coefficient was excellent (alpha > 0.90). There was a strong convergent correlation between the ALDS and the disability related Activity domain of the VascuQol (r = 0.64).The ALDS is a promising clinimetric instrument to measure disability in patients with various stages of peripheral arterial disease.
