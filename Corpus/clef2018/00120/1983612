Simultaneous carotid endarterectomy and coronary artery bypass. when is it indicated?. In cases of concommitant coronary heart disease (CHD) and carotid artery stenosis (CAST) simultaneous correction has a higher risk. Transcranial Doppler flow measurements at the level of the arteria cerebri media did not detect any flow reduction during open heart surgery in patients with and without carotid lesions. New neurologic deficits during open heart procedures are mostly due to embolism from ECC or from the heart, rather than a high grade carotid stenosis. Simultaneous correction of CHD and CAST is only indicated in patients with severely unstable angina and symptomatic high grade stenosis of the carotid artery.
