Retrograde transpopliteal recanalization of chronic superficial femoral artery occlusion after failed re-entry during antegrade subintimal angioplasty. To evaluate the acute success and clinical impact of retrograde transpopliteal access for subintimal recanalization of superficial femoral artery (SFA) and proximal popliteal artery (PA) occlusions after failed attempts to re-enter the true lumen in the antegrade femoral approach.From 2002 to 2007, 56 patients (43 men mean age 68+/-9 years, range 43-87) with stable chronic peripheral artery disease (Rutherford category 2 to 5) were treated with antegrade subintimal angioplasty that could not be completed owing to re-entry failure. Mean occlusion length was 17+/-7 cm (range 4-32), including 13 TASC II A (23.2%), 10 TASC II B (17.8%), 16 TASC II C (28.5%), and 17 TASC II D (30.3%) lesions. After re-entry to the true lumen failed in the antegrade approach, including predilation of the false channel, all patients were turned to a prone position, and a 5-F or 6-F sheath was placed into the mid segment of the PA under fluoroscopic guidance. Retrograde wire passage was attempted with a 0.035-inch hydrophilic guidewire.Fifty-five (98.2%) of 56 procedures were finished successfully with a residual stenosis of <30% the 1 failure was due stent deformation within the occluded segment that could not be passed from either an antegrade or retrograde access. In all interventions, balloon angioplasty was performedFailed antegrade attempts to recanalize chronic total occlusions of the SFA and proximal PA can be salvaged using a retrograde popliteal access, with a low complication rate, as an alternative to using a re-entry device. However, durability of the intervention using current interventional tools is limited.
