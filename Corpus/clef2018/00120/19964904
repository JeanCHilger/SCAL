Spatial mapping of real-time quantitative shear stress with vascular oxidative stress. Fluid shear stress is intimately involved in vascular oxidative stress and atherosclerosis. Oxidative stress induces molecular signaling that regulates the development of vascular calcification. The explants of New Zealand White (NZW) rabbit aortas were used to assess vascular oxidative stress in non-obstructive, albeit inflammatory, lesions. The development of Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) shear stress and oxidative stress sensors has provided a means to study atherogenic hemodynamics and vascular oxidative stress. Computational fluid dynamics and Doppler ultrasound were utilized in combination with the immunohistochemistry staining to show that the flow disturbance as assessed by the micro-scale sensors in non-obstructive plaques was associated with oxidative stress relevant for initiation of the arterial plaque. Our findings represent a concerted effort to assess the relationship between oxidative stress and the mechanically unstable plaque in the presence of vascular calcification.
