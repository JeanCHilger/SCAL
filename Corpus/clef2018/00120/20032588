Association between arterial stiffness and estimated glomerular filtration rate in the Japanese general population. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, although it has yet to be established whether CKD is an independent risk factor for arterial stiffness in community residents. The purpose of this study was to determine the correlation between the cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in the general population.We studied 881 consecutively enrolled subjects undergoing health checkups. CAVI was calculated automatically from the pulse volume record, blood pressure and the vascular length from the heart to the ankle. CKD was evaluated by the eGFR.The distribution of eGFR was as follows: 241 with eGFR (mL/min/1.73m(2)) > or =90 572 with eGFR 60-89CAVI was independently correlated with eGFR indicating that CKD is associated with arterial stiffness in the general population.
