Primary use of sirolimus-eluting stents in the infrapopliteal arteries. To report 12-month outcomes following application of sirolimus-eluting stents (SES) in infrapopliteal arteries in patients with chronic limb ischemia.A prospective single-center study was conducted involving 146 consecutive patients (102 men mean age 73+/-9 years) with Rutherford-Becker categories 2 to 5 lower limb ischemia who underwent SES placement. The average degree of stenosis at baseline was 86%+/-5%Fifteen (10%) patients were lost to follow-up, and 27 (18%) patients died during the follow-up period, leaving 104 patients undergoing the 6- and 12-month follow-up examinations. After 6 months and 1 year, the primary patency rates were 88.5% and 83.7%, respectively. The mean ABI increased from 0.6+/-0.4 at baseline to 0.8+/-0.2 after 6 months and remained significantly improved during 1-year follow-up (p<0.0001). The mean Rutherford-Becker classification decreased from 3.3+/-0.8 at baseline to 0.9+/-1.1 (p<0.0001) after 1 year.Treatment of infrapopliteal arteries with SES yields encouraging long-term results that compare favorably with previously published data on bare metal stents or plain balloon angioplasty.
