The potentialities of Doppler sonography in evaluating the distal vascular channel in chronic obliterating diseases of the arteries of the lower extremities. The work deals with the techniques of examination of the leg arteries in patients with atherosclerosis obliterans of the lower limb vessels by the method of doppler sonography (DS) and dopplerography. The authors examined 111 arterial segments in 43 patients. The results of these methods were compared with the findings of radiocontrast angiography. The absolute percentage of the coincidence of diagnosis (AP), sensitivity (Se), and specificity (Sp) of these methods were calculated according to two criteria--"normal" vessel and "occlusion". In DS, AP was 93 +/- 2%, Se-95 +/- 4%, Sp-93 +/- 2%, the respective values in dopplerography were 81 +/- 3%, 84 +/- +/- 11%, and 79 +/- 4%. The difference between these methods according to AP and Sp was statistically significant (p less than 0.001). The authors believe that the higher percentage of coincidences of diagnosis in DS is linked with the possibility of purposeful study of the blood flow in the vessel, being guided by its image.
