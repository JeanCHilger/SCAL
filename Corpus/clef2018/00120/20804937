Noninvasive assessment of lower extremity hemodynamics in individuals with diabetes mellitus. The timely and accurate noninvasive assessment of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a critical component of a limb preservation initiative in patients with diabetes mellitus. Noninvasive vascular studies (NIVS) can be useful in screening patients with diabetes for PAD. In patients with clinical signs or symptoms, NIVS provide crucial information on the presence, location, and severity of PAD, as well as an objective assessment of the potential for primary healing of an index wound or a surgical incision. Appropriately-selected NIVS are important in the decision-making process to determine whether and what type of intervention might be most appropriate, given the clinical circumstances. Hemodynamic monitoring is likewise very important following either an endovascular procedure or a surgical bypass. Surveillance studies, usually with a combination of physiologic testing and imaging with duplex ultrasound, accurately identify recurrent disease prior to the occurrence of thrombosis, allowing targeted reintervention. NIVS can be broadly grouped into three general categories: physiologic or hemodynamic measurements anatomic imaging
