Osteoprotegerin is higher in peripheral arterial disease regardless of glycaemic status. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) are both associated with excessive vascular calcification and elevated levels of inflammatory markers IL-6 and hsCRP. The recently identified Osteoprotegerin(OPG)/RANKL/TRAIL pathway has been implicated in vascular calcification, but data on levels in PAD and effect of co-existent DM are lacking.4 groups of patients were recruited - 26 with PAD and DM, 35 with DM alone, 22 with PAD alone, and 21 healthy individuals. Serum OPG, RANKL, TRAIL, hsCRP and IL-6 were measured using commercial ELISA assays. Presence and severity of PAD was defined using ankle brachial index (ABI).Serum OPG (7.4±0.3 vs.5.8±0.2 pmol/l, p<0.0001), TRAIL (95.5±5.2 ng/ml vs. 76.2±4.4 ng/ml, p=0.006), hsCRP (2.6±0.3 vs. 1.8±0.3 mg/l, p=0.048), and IL-6 (4.1±0.4 vs. 2.9±0.4 pg/ml, p=0.06) were higher in patients with PAD. There was no difference in RANKL. Only OPG was significantly higher in PAD and DM (7.2±0.3 pmol/l) and PAD alone (7.7±0.4 pmol/l) compared to DM only (5.8±0.3 pmol/l) and healthy controls (5.6±0.4 pmol/l), p<0.01, but OPG was no higher in those with DM plus PAD versus those with PAD alone (p<0.3). Only OPG was associated with PAD severity, correlating negatively with ABI (r=-0.26, p=0.03), independent of age, gender, glycaemic status, hsCRP and IL-6.PAD is associated with higher serum OPG, regardless of the co-existence of DM. This finding, in addition to its correlation with severity of PAD, suggests that OPG may be a novel marker for the presence and severity of PAD, possibly by reflecting the degree of underlying vascular calcification.
