Surgical tactics in arteriovenous dysplasias in relation to the site and extent of the lesion. Current procedures (venous occlusive plethysmography, Doppler ultrasound echocardiography, transcutaneous oxygen tension determination and computed tomography) for examining patients allow one to clarify the nature, extent, site, and features of anatomic relationships between the intact tissues and angiodysplasia-afflicted areas, to substantially facilitate the choice of surgical management of such patients. Application of current procedures for anesthesiological protection of the patients with the use of hemodilution, drug-controlled hypotension, as well as the patient's autoblood during the operation ensures a radical intervention provided that the surgical concept is based on stepped therapy by using the endovascular occlusion techniques and following the due dates of each intervention stage.
