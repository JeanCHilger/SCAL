Association between brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity and endothelium-dependent and -independent coronary vasomotor function. 1. Coronary endothelial function and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) are independent predictors of cardiovascular events. Thus, in the present study we examined the relationship between baPWV and endothelium-dependent and -independent coronary vasodilatory functions. 2. Sixty-five patients (12 diabetic and 53 non-diabetic) with no significant stenosis of the coronary artery were studied and baPWV determined. After cardiac catheterization, graded doses of bradykinin (BK 0.2, 0.6 and 2.0 Î¼g/min), nitroglycerin (NTG
