The efficacy analysis of endovascular intervention therapy for transatlantic inter society consensus type C and type D femoropopliteal arteriosclerosis lesion. To evaluate the efficacy of the endovascular intervention for transatlantic inter society consensus (TASC) type C and type D femoropopliteal artery disease.We conducted a retrospective analysis on 95 cases (98 lower limbs) with TASC type C and type D femoropopliteal artery arteriosclerosis lesion treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and/or primary stent implantation from January 2007 to April 2009. We used ankle brachial index (ABI), Fontaine stages, limb salvage percentage and primary patency to evaluate the efficacy of the endovascular intervention therapy.The technical success rate of the 98 limbs was 94.9%, the perioperation mortality was 4.2% and the total amputation rate was 5.1%. 81 cases (84 limbs) were followed-up for a mean time of (13 ± 7) months, whose average ABI in dorsalis pedis artery and posterior tibial artery were 0.58 ± 0.22 and 0.60 ± 0.21 and increased 0.14 ± 0.25 and 0.13 ± 0.22 respectively than the ABI before intervention therapy. The statistical analysis showed a significant difference in ABI. The limbs of critical limb ischemia (CLI) were of 16.4% in the follow-up period and of 73.5% before the intervention therapy. The statistical results showed a significant difference in the percentage of CLI.Percutaneous endovascular intervention is an effective and minimally invasive method, and has a curative clinical efficacy to treat TASC type C and type D femoropopliteal artery disease.
