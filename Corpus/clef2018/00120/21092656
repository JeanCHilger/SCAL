The relationship between occupational physical activity intensity and peripheral arterial disease. to explore the relationship between occupational physical activity and peripheral arterial disease (PAD)assessed by ankle-brachial index (ABI).data including ABI, occupational physical activity intensity, health history, medication use, blood biochemistry and physical examinations derived from 16 446 subjects from 9 areas throughout China were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate adjusted logistic regression analysis were used for the data analyses.occupational physical activity intensity was classified into 5 levels as jobless, very light, light, moderate and heavy intensity. With the increasing of physical activity intensity, the risk of PAD gradually decreased (P(trend) < 0.05). In comparison with jobless group, the ORs of PAD for other groups were 0.65 (95%CI: 0.52, 0.82), 0.70 (95%CI: 0.56, 0.87), 0.57 (95%CI: 0.44, 0.73), 0.65 (95%CI: 0.53, 0.80) respectively. After adjusting for gender, age, smoke, obesity/overweight, the history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and stroke, the ORs were 1.02 (95%CI: 0.80, 1.31), 0.91 (95%CI: 0.72, 1.15), 0.92 (95%CI: 0.70, 1.19), 0.90 (95%CI: 0.72, 1.12) (P(trend) < 0.05).PAD risk reduced in proportion with increasing occupational physical activity.
