Arterial embolism of the limbs in infectious endocarditis of the heart valves. Nine cases of infective endocarditis (IE) on native valves, complicated by arterial embolism of the limbs (AEL), were collected between June 1974 and October 1988 (prevalence 4.3 percent). Among the 11 AEL recorded, 9 involved the lower limbs and 2 the upper limbs. The diagnosis, suspected in patients with acute ischaemia (n = 6), transient (n = 1) or pseudophlebitic (n = 1) pain, or discovered by systematic pulse examination (n = 3), was confirmed by Doppler ultrasound (n = 3), angiography (n = 2) or oscillometry (n = 4). AEL occurred 2.8 weeks on average after the onset of treatment it appeared 6 months after the end of treatment in 1 case and preceded the diagnosis of IE by 1 to 6 weeks in 3 cases. The causative organisms isolated in 7 cases were: non-haemolytic streptococci (n = 4), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (n = 1) and enterococcus (n = 1). Vegetations were found in 6 of the 7 patients explored by echocardiography. Two cases of embolism of the femoral artery required embolectomy. Effective heparin anticoagulation was obtained in only one patient. Six patients underwent valve replacement in the acute phase of endocarditis. After a mean follow-up period of 32 months (range 3 to 120 months), only one patient has symptoms (claudication of the left upper limb)
