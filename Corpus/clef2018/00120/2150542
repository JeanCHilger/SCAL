Treatment of obliterating arteriopathies of the lower limbs using angioplasty. Comparison of 2 techniques of recanalization: Nd-YAG laser and radiofrequency thermal probe. The Authors report their experience about 20 cases of femoro-popliteal revascularization: in 15 cases a Nd-YAG Laser was used in 5 cases a unity which employs radiofrequency energy to heat the tip (Thermoprobe) was utilized. We obtained an immediate recanalization in 19 out of 20 superficial femoral arteries with two early thrombosis. In 12 patients of the first group a significant increase of the ankle-brachial index (45%) was seen
