Carotid intima-media thickness and plaque as surrogate biomarkers of atherosclerosis among consecutive women with systemic lupus erythematosus. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in understanding the pathogenic pathways of premature accelerated atherosclerosis (AS) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, the role of both traditional and non-traditional, SLE-specific risk factors is still under debate.To assess surrogate biomarkers of subclinical AS in SLE and to evaluate potential relations with cardiovascular risk factors.Prospective observational study on 35 consecutive SLE women (ACR 1987 diagnostic criteria) evaluated according to a standard protocol including traditional cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, abnormal lipid metabolism), SLE-specific risk factors (renal disease, SLE activity and duration, corticosteroid therapy) and surrogate biomarkers of subclinical AS (carotid intima-media thickness, plaque) (B-mode color Doppler ultrasound, 7-10 MHz probe). Data were analyzed in SPSS 16 software, p<0.05.Significant differences (p<0.05) among subgroups (with and without plaque, thickened and normal intima) have been registered moreover, statistical significant correlations between cIMT and age (r=0.476), age at onset (r=0.451), VLDL (r=0.382), hsCRP (r=0.436), Framingham score (r=0.421) have been reported. In addition, significant association between homocysteine and SLE-duration (r=0.460), SLEDAI (r=0.466), SLICCÃ·ACR (r=0.846) has been demonstrated, while hsCRP was associated with ESR (r=0.472), C3 (r=0.396), SLEDAI (r=0.569) and age (r=-0.681). Several predictors for increased cIMT have also been identified (ANOVA): hsCRP (p=0.016), VLDL (p=0.037), Framingham (p=0.012).Our data advocate for increased cardiovascular burden in SLE and support the value of cIMT and carotid plaque as surrogate AS biomarkers in women with SLE.
