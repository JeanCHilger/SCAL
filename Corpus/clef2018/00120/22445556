Critical ischemia in patients over 80: waiting or evidence-based surgical treatment?. Critical ischemia is defined by continuous pain, impending sleep, with ankle pressure less than 50mm Hg, and/or first toe pressure less than 30 mm Hg (Dormandy et Rutherford, 2000 Norgren et al., 2007). Treatment of patients aged over 80 requires specific knowledge of arteriopathy at this age and an evaluation of co-morbidity factors (diabetes mellitus, renal failure, ischemic cardiopathy). Assessment should include: the degree of ischemia, the extension of arterial disease, the co-morbidity factors, and the diffusion of the atherosclerotic disease. A transatlantic consensus conference has enabled a classification of arterial lesions determining therapeutic indications. Aorto-iliac lesions may be treated by surgery or angioplasty. Femoro-popliteal or crural lesions may be treated by surgery or angioplasty. Type C or D lesions should be treated by femoro-popliteal or crural bypass. Bypass to the ankle or foot are done on high peripheral resistances. These bypasses require a venous graft. Several authors have shown the utility of short grafts: popliteo-tibial, tibiotibial, tibiopedal artery bypass, tibioplantar artery bypass. In patients over 80, the presence of arteriopathy is an important mortality factor, which is four or five times more important than in the normal population. Twenty-five percent of patients will require amputation.
