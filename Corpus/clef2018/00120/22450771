Medicinal or instrumental (corrected) therapy of renal artery stenosis?. Arteriosclerotic renal artery stenosis (RAS) has an increased incidence in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. Clinically RAS presents in some patients as secondary, sometimes resistant arterial hypertension and in others as chronic renal insufficiency, sometimes with acute renal failure and in a third group both symptoms are observed. Doppler ultrasound plays a central role in the diagnosis of RAS. Therapeutically, it is important to identify hemodynamically relevant RAS before interventional therapy is initiated. The therapy of RAS has been under intensive debate since the publication of randomized controlled trials (RCT) which showed that only a subset of RAS can be successfully treated by interventional therapy. Since then the medicinal therapy of RAS has gained more and more impact. The following questions are raised: which forms of RAS can be treated by which therapy? What is the best medicinal therapy to treat RAS? What substances are recommended?
