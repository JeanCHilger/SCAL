External iliac artery stenting: high incidence of concomitant revascularization procedures. To review immediate results, patency rates, hemodynamic success, and incidence of concomitant procedures with external iliac artery stenting (EIAS).Demographic features, category and clinical grade, Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus II classification lesion type, pre- and postprocedure ankle-brachial indices, and primary patency were compared between group 1 (EIAS without distal revascularization) and group 2 (EIAS with concomitant distal revascularization).No mortality and a 100% immediate technical success rate was recorded in group 1 (n = 12) and group 2 (n = 24). Eleven patients (30.6%) also had stenting of the adjacent common iliac artery. Two thirds of group 2 patients required concomitant femoral or distal revascularization.No difference in stent patency rates was found between patients in group 1 versus group 2. Patients requiring EIAS tend to have more diffuse arterial disease necessitating complicated open reconstruction and/or distal revascularization, as well as more proximal iliac stenting.
