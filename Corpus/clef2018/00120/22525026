Transcollateral approach for percutaneous revascularization of complex superficial femoral artery and tibioperoneal trunk occlusions. This report describes the use of transcollateral retrograde revascularization in two patients after failed recanalization of the tibioperoneal trunk in one and superficial femoral artery occlusion in the other. Retrograde recanalization was successfully achieved via a distal branch of the profunda femoris artery in the first case and a medial genicular branch in the second. After successful retrograde recanalization, the guide wire was snared in both cases and angioplasty/stent placement was performed in an antegrade fashion.
