Detection of coronary microembolization by Doppler ultrasound in patients with stable angina pectoris during percutaneous coronary interventions under an adjunctive antithrombotic therapy with abciximab: design and rationale of the High Intensity Transient Signals ReoPro (HITS-RP) study. Embolization of atherosclerotic debris from the rupture of a vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque occurs iatrogenically during percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) and can induce myocardial necrosis. These microembolizations are detected as high intensity transient signals (HITS) using intracoronary Doppler technology.In the presented study we will test if abciximab (ReoPro®) infusion reduces high intensity transient signals in patients with stable angina pectoris undergoing PCI in comparison to standard therapy alone.The High Intensity Transient Signals ReoPro® (HITS-RP) study will enroll 60 patients. It is a prospective, single center, randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial. The study is designed to compare the efficacy of intravenous abciximab administration for reduction of microembolization during elective PCI. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to abciximab or placebo infusion. The primary end point of the HITS-RP-Study is the number of HITS during PCI measured by intracoronary Doppler wire. Secondary endpoints are bleeding complications, elevation of cardiac biomarkers or ECG changes after percutaneous coronary interventions, changes in coronary flow velocity reserve, hs-CRP elevation, any major adverse cardio-vascular event during one month follow-up.The HITS-RP-Study addresses important questions regarding the efficacy of intravenous abciximab administration in reducing microembolization and periprocedural complications in stable angina pectoris patients undergoing PCI.The trial is registered under http://www.drks-neu.uniklinik-freiburg.de/drks_web/:DRKS00000603.
