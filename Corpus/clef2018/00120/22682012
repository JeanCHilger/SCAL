Anatomical predictors of major adverse limb events after infrapopliteal angioplasty for patients with critical limb ischaemia due to pure isolated infrapopliteal lesions. To identify anatomical factors associated with major adverse limb events (MALE) after angioplasty as the basis for a novel morphology-driven classification of infrapopliteal lesions.Retrospective-multicenter study.Between March 2004 and October 2010, 1057 limbs from 884 patients with CLI due to isolated infrapopliteal lesions were studied. Freedom-from MALE, defined as major amputation or any reintervention, was assessed out to 2 years by the Kaplan-Meier methods. Anatomical predictors and risk stratification for MALE were analyzed by multivariate analysis.Freedom-from MALE was 47 Â± 1% at 2 years. Lesion calcification, target vessel diameter<3.0 mm, lesion length>300 mm and no below-the-ankle (BA) run-off were positively associated with MALE by multivariate-analysis. The total number of risk factors was used to calculate the risk score for each limbs for subsequent categorization into 3 groups with 0 or 1 (low-risk), 2 (moderate-risk) and 3 or 4 (high-risk) factors. Freedom-from MALE at 2 year-rates was 59% in low-risk, 46% in moderate-risk, and 29% in high-risk, respectively.Target vessel diameter <3.0 mm, lesion calcification, lesion length > 300 mm and no-BA run-off were associated with MALE after infrapopliteal angioplasty. Risk stratification based on these predictors allows estimation of future incidence of MALE in CLI with isolated infrapopliteal lesions.
