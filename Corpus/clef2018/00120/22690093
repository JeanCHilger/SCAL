High prevalence of peripheral arterial disease in Korean patients with coronary or cerebrovascular disease. This prospective study surveyed the prevalence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in Korean patients with coronary arterial disease (CAD) or cerebrovascular disorder (CVD). From March 2010, 576 hospitalized patients in cardiovascular or stroke center were enrolled as the study group. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) was measured and the cut-off point for diagnosing PAD was ≤ 0.9 at rest. A total of 424 hospitalized patients in the Department of Surgery and aged ≥ 50 yr was enrolled as the control group. The prevalence of PAD was significantly higher in the study group than the control group (7.6% vs 1.7% P < 0.001). To analyze the relationship of other vascular diseases and PAD, the patients were regrouped
