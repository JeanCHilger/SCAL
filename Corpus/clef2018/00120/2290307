Surgical therapy of acute and embolizing deep venous thrombosis--indication, technical principle, results. Between 1977 and 1986, 185 patients with deep venous thrombosis (117 with acute occlusive and 68 with embolizing deep venous thrombosis) underwent venous thrombectomy with arterio-venous fistula. The early patency rate was 96%, and the perioperative mortality rate, 3.8%. Of the 157 patients in whom extremities were involved, 147 were examined 12-118 months postoperatively (mean 43 +/- 23 months) clinically, by Doppler ultrasound and by light reflexion rheography (LRR). In 49% of the patients, various kinds of swelling or oedema of the involved extremities were present. There were no hemodynamical disturbances in 53% (LRR-examination) competent venous valves were found in 44%. According to the severity of symptoms and hemodynamical findings, postthrombotic syndrome was absent in 47%, mild in 20%, moderate in 28%, and severe in 5% (7 patients, 4 with venous ulcers). Six of the 7 patients with severe postthrombotic syndrome belonged to the group operated for embolizing thrombosis, where no selection of cases was performed. The best long-term results were achieved in patients operated for acute occlusive thrombosis of the iliac and iliofemoral veins. Venous thrombectomy with av fistula can achieve sufficient early and long-term results in the treatment of deep venous thrombosis, provided strict selection of patients and a meticulous technique are practised.
