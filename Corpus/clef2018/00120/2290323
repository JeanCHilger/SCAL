Effect of finoptin on systemic and cerebral hemodynamics in patients with early cerebrovascular disorders in arteriosclerotic stenosis of major arteries of the head. Blood Evans Blue dilution and ultrasound Doppler cardiography were used to examine systemic and cerebral hemodynamic changes after a single intravenous administration of finoptin (5 mg) and its course treatment (a daily dose of 120-240 mg) in 30 patients with initial signs of cerebrovascular insufficiency and 30 patients with transient cerebrovascular disorders in the presence of atherosclerotic stenoses of the cephalic great arteries. Finoptin was found to increase the linear velocity of blood flow mainly in stenotic arteries, without causing intracerebral steal. The agent also exerted a clear-cut cardiodepressive action which was levelled off by its vasodilating effect by the end of its course therapy.
