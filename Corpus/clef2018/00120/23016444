Usage of hydrophilic catheters and guidewires in endovascular surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of hydrophilic catheters and guidewires during endovascular overcoming long stenoses or occlusions of the superficial femoral and popliteal artery.Based on 142 procedures rated the functionality of the equipment of the hydrophilic coating. The operations were performed in the years 2010-2012 in the Department of Vascular, General and Transplantation, Medical University in Wroclaw. Procedures related to recanalization or enlargement of the superficial femoral artery. Patients were divided into groups according to the Consensus TASC II depending on the length change. Each patient was assessed ankle-brachial ratio (ABI), claudication distance measured and constructed with double ultrasound imaging (USG-DD). In doubtful cases an additional study was performed with contrast computed tomography (angio-CT). The procedure was performed at the Laboratory of angiography using a angiograph Siemens Artis Zee Ceiling. Every time the contrlateral access was made, and as the first step the angiography was performed to verify type of changes in the arteries. A significant benefit of using hydrophilic guidewires and catheters in patients with long stenoses or occlusions. In case of long and calcified changes, hydrophilic catheters was the only option because it gave good support for hydrophilic guidewire.The changes in the type C and D according to the criteria for TASC II, an essential tool to achieve a positive treatment effect is the use of hydrophilic catheters and guidewires.
