Hemodynamic assessment of aortoiliac segment. Routine noninvasive tests often fail to identify advanced aortoiliac stenosis, especially in cases with multilevel disease. At present, direct measurements of femoral artery pressure provide the best assessment of the hemodynamic effect of a proximal lesion, especially when flow is increased in order to simulate exercise. In the future, duplex scanning may replace invasive pressure studies.
