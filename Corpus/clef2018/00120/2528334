Long-term results of combined iliac balloon angioplasty and distal surgical revascularization. Long-term results of combined use of iliac artery percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and distal surgical revascularization for the management of multilevel occlusive disease were evaluated over a 12-year period. A total of 79 combined procedures were performed in 75 patients. All patients had tandem occlusive disease, with the inflow lesion felt to preclude a distal revascularization procedure alone. Revascularization was performed for incapacitating claudication in 17 (22%) and limb salvage indications in 62 (78%) cases. A mean resting iliac artery pressure gradient of 29 +/- 11 mmHg pre-PTA was reduced to 0.9 +/- 0.4 post-PTA. Major complications of PTA occurred in five (6%) cases, but four were successfully corrected at the time of the distal surgical procedure without alteration of the operative plan. Infrainguinal operations included 55 femoropopliteal or tibial bypass grafts, 18 femorofemoral grafts, and 6 profundaplasties. Mean follow-up was 43 months. By life table analysis, the 5-year primary patency rate of the distal surgical procedures was 76% a secondary patency of 88% at 5 years was achieved by various means of reintervention. Mean pretreatment ankle/brachial index of 0.31 +/- 0.14 increased to 0.80 +/- 0.16 after operation (p less than 0.0001). The 5-year limb salvage rate was 90%. There were no operative deaths. We conclude that in carefully selected patients, combined use of iliac PTA and distal surgical reconstruction is effective and durable, safely reducing the extent of surgical intervention while reliably increasing the comprehensiveness of revascularization.
