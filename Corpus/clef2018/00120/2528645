Changes in peripheral hemodynamics after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. We measured ankle/arm pressure indexes and blood flow rates before and after performing percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in 36 extremities. Flow rates through the leg were determined with a magnetic resonance blood flow scanner. All patients had claudication one had gangrene, another had an ulcer, and two complained of rest pain. The median age was 65 years, and 72% were men. There were 25 dilations of the iliac artery, 12 of the superficial femoral artery, and eight of the popliteal arteries
