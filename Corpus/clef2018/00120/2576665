Verapamil and nebivolol improve carotid artery distensibility in hypertensive patients. The effects of verapamil (a calcium antagonist) and nebivolol (a novel, selective beta 1-adrenoceptor blocker) on carotid artery distensibility and cross-sectional compliance were studied non-invasively in hypertensive patients with the use of a high-resolution multigate pulsed Doppler system. Arm blood pressure measurements were made with an automated device (Dinamap). After a 4-week washout period, 19 patients (aged 21-73 years) with essential hypertension entered a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled crossover study with 120 mg verapamil or placebo three times a day for 4 weeks. After the administration of verapamil, carotid artery distensibility and cross-sectional compliance were significantly larger (P less than 0.05) than after placebo. Using the same protocol, 29 patients (aged 25-70 years) were given 5 mg nebivolol or placebo once a day for 4 weeks. After the administration of nebivolol, carotid artery distensibility and cross-sectional compliance were significantly larger (P less than 0.05) than after placebo. In both studies no significant differences in diameter and pulse pressure were found between placebo and verapamil or nebivolol. Blood pressure was decreased similarly with both verapamil and nebivolol. These results indicate that both verapamil and nebivolol favourably influence carotid artery distensibility and cross-sectional compliance of the common carotid artery, resulting in a better management of the systolic pressure pulse. The improved carotid artery distensibility may help to protect the patient against atherosclerotic complications of hypertension.
