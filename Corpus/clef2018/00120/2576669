Plethysmographic effects of doxazosin in essential hypertensive patients. In the treatment of hypertensive patients with peripheral vascular disease, alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockers may be considered first-choice drugs since they reduce the total peripheral resistance and do not decrease the plasma volume. As a preliminary step, we investigated the plethysmographic effects of doxazosin (1-8 mg for 6 weeks) on calf flow in 32 uncomplicated hypertensive patients. Despite the fall in sitting and standing blood pressure (from 163 +/- 18/101 +/- 6 to 147 +/- 19/94 +/- 8 mmHg and from 162 +/- 18/107 +/- 9 to 145 +/- 18/95 +/- 8 mmHg, respectively both P less than 0.001) the calf flow was not decreased at rest and after ischaemia. Resting resistance was not significantly reduced (from 49.5 +/- 35 to 38.9 +/- 33 mmHg/100 ml per min) but its fall was significantly correlated with the fall in mean blood pressure (rs = 0.35, P less than 0.05). These findings confirm that doxazosin may be useful in the treatment of hypertension complicated by peripheral artery disease.
