Flow/velocity characteristics of arterial bypass stenoses. In the carotid system with relatively constant blood flow, peak systolic velocity within a stenosis (PSVST) can characterize the degree of hemodynamic stenosis. We have studied flow/velocity characteristics in an in vitro model of stenosis within conduits of varying diameters in an attempt to quantify the degree of stenosis from flow/velocity profiles in peripheral vein bypasses. A Harvard pulsatile flow pump (70 BPM) pumped human blood (HCT, 35-45%) through thin-walled polytetrafluoroethylene (3-6 mm in i.d.) into a variable peripheral resistance maintaining a constant mean blood pressure of 80 mm Hg over a flow range of 0-500 ml/min. A Diasonics DRF400 duplex scanner with a 10-MHz imager and 4.5-MHz Doppler probe was used to image and Doppler the conduits and measure flow through them. Validation of Doppler flow measurements (DF) was performed comparing them with flow measured (MF) by timed collection. PSVST within and pressure drop across a 50% stenosis was measured for each of the conduit's sizes over a range of 0-500 ml/min MF. The results show a good correlation between DF and MF (r = 0.99, P less than 0.001) for the whole range of internal diameters. In each 50% stenosed conduit, PSVST correlated well with MF (r = 0.95, P less than 0.001). Curves were constructed of MF vs PSVST for each 50% stenosed conduit. We conclude that measurement of volumetric flow, conduit diameter, and peak systolic velocity within a vein bypass can objectively predict bypass stenoses of 50% or greater.
