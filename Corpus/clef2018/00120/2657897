Color Doppler evaluation of arterial stenoses and occlusions involving the neck and thoracic inlet. Color Doppler flow imaging is a new technique providing simultaneous display of a gray-scale tissue and a color-flow vascular image. We demonstrate its ability to predict accurately occlusions of numerous vessels, including the internal carotid, external carotid, common carotid, subclavian and innominate arteries. Alterations in flow direction and changes in spectral wave form provide useful clues to the presence of these occlusions. The cases are correlated with angiographic findings and functional flow diagrams of the hemodynamic changes involved.
