Doppler waveform parvus and tardus. A sign of proximal flow obstruction. The Doppler linear flow velocity versus time spectrum obtained in an arterial flow system in which there is proximal occlusive disease with or without collateral formation has a tardus-parvus waveform. The conditions that cause this Doppler sign are due to a poststenotic pressure drop.
