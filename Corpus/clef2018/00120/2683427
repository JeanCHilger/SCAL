Doppler ultrasound parameters for peripheral arterial vascular diagnosis. In order to control the valency of Doppler-sonographic parameters for the arterial vascular diagnostics, in patients with arterial obstructive disease apart from the measurement of the blood pressure characteristics of Doppler speed curves were analysed. Proximal obstacles of the vascular system of haemodynamic relevance led to the systolic decrease of pressure in the area of the extremities and to the monophasic configuration of curves with increased diastolic flow velocity and loss of the reflux component. Relations to the degree of severity of the ischaemia were found. The Doppler-sonographic comprehension of a changed local behavior of resistance and blood supply was valuable also for the differential diagnosis.
