Evaluation of arterial supply to the legs by noninvasive methods in elderly patients with diabetes. Rheographic investigations and segmental measurements of pressure by Doppler method were done in 49 patients with type II diabetes or with impaired glucose tolerance who had chronic ischaemia of lower extremities in all stages, after Fontaine. The diagnostic usefulness of both methods was demonstrated, similarly as the correlation of their results with clinically determined progression of arterial ischaemia of the lower extremities. Parallel application of both methods was particularly useful in diabetic since it made possible detection of MÃ¶nckeberg's arteriosclerosis and evaluation of collateral circulation development.
