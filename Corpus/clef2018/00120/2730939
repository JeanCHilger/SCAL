Intracompartmental pressure in the anterior tibial compartment. Demonstration of the course of pressure in the gait cycle. During walking the anterior tibial compartment pressure was measured continuously using a new technique. The test subjects were made to walk on a treadmill at the standardised walking spees fo 3, 6, and 8 km/h. Documentation of intrafascial pressure was obtained continously, while gait-analysis and pressure changes were simultaneously documented on video-tape. Readily reproductible pressure curves were obtained. The increase in walking speed correlated to increase in intracompartmental pressure, and the varying pressure was accurately correlated to gait phases. Minimum pressure was recorded in the phase immediately prior to initial heel contact (IC). During "mid-stand" (MST) the pressure remained constant. "Terminal-stand" (TSZ) and pre-swing (PS) are associated with peak pressure. The method described is suitable for continuous and reproducible measurement during walking.
