Treadmill exercise promotes cyclic alterations in coronary blood flow in dogs with coronary artery stenoses and endothelial injury. We have previously shown in anesthetized, open-chest dogs with coronary stenosis and endothelial injury that serotonin and/or thromboxane A2 (TXA2) receptor activation play a major role in the mediation of platelet-dependent, intermittent coronary occlusion. Using a similar model in awake, closed-chest dogs, we tested the following hypotheses: (a) treadmill exercise promotes the development of cyclic flow variations in dogs with coronary stenoses and endothelial injury (b) ventricular pacing does not induce cyclic flow variations in the same dogs
