Computer-assisted evaluation of bicycle ergometry. The pedal ergometry is a reliable method for testing the functional capacity of patients with organic arterial obstructive diseases of the lower extremities. In order to lower the loss of time for evaluation pedal work and performance were calculated by means of a microcomputer KC 85/1 with the help of a basic programme using Hall switch circuits. The connection between working ability of the pedal, type of obstruction and pressure values of the posterior tibial artery is documented in the light of the measuring results of 61 patients with arterial obstructive disease of the lower extremities and of 32 test persons with healthy vessels.
