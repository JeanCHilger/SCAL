Validation of a non-invasive method for localization of atherosclerotic occlusive disease in the legs. The accuracy in determining the level of haemodynamically significant occlusive arterial disease (stenosis of greater than or equal to 50%) in the leg by a combination of segmental blood pressure measurements and evaluation of pulses with the Doppler shift technique was assessed in 50 patients (100 legs), using angiography as the reference method. For aorto-iliac disease the sensitivity was 72%, the specificity 97% and the diagnostic accuracy 87%. For femoro-popliteal disease the corresponding figures were 87%, 78% and 85%, respectively. The accuracy of a positive diagnosis was 93% for both levels. Similar results were obtained for combined aorto-iliac and femoro-popliteal disease. The accuracy in detecting calf disease was poor.
