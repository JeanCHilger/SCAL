Doppler ultrasound surface monitoring of both arterial and venous flow in clinical free tissue transfers. A hand-held nondirectional Doppler ultrasound flowmeter has been used to monitor the arterial and venous patency of 60 clinical free tissue transfers. Based on information obtained, three flaps were re-explored, at which time the preoperative diagnosis of arterial or venous occlusion was confirmed. Two of the three flaps were salvaged. This readily available, noninvasive system has been useful in monitoring clinical free tissue transfers whose surfaces are exposed.
