Transluminal balloon angioplasty in diabetic peripheral vascular disease. Transluminal (balloon) angioplasty of iliac or superficial femoral stenoses in 18 diabetic patients resulted in a significant improvement in ankle/brachial systolic pressure index with marked symptomatic improvement in 16, little change in one and deterioration requiring arterial bypass surgery in one patient. Follow-up for 12 months or more showed that the initial good results were sustained despite a downward drift in ankle pressures. These findings indicate that transluminal angioplasty has a useful place in the management of proximal atherosclerotic stenotic lesions in diabetic patients with symptomatic peripheral vascular disease.
