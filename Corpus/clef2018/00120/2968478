Partitional measurements of circulation can be made between capillaries and arteriovenous anastomoses in the human finger. We compared the responses of finger blood flow to local and/or whole body warming, as measured by laser Doppler flowmetry (PERIFLUX PF-1d) (LDF), and by venous occlusion plethysmography (BF). The subject's hands were immersed in a bath of water whose temperature (Tw) was initially set at 25 degrees C. The tested hand was kept at about 10 cm above heart level to facilitate the drainage of finger veins during measurement. The ambient temperature (Ta) was initially 20 degrees C. Then, measurements were made under the following conditions on separate days: 1) local hand warming only (LHW), Tw raised from 25 to 40 degrees C 2) whole body warming only (WBW), Ta was raised from 20 to 35 degrees C
