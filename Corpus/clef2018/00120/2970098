Intraluminal stents in atherosclerotic iliac artery stenosis: preliminary report of a multicenter study. Fifteen patients with symptomatic iliac artery stenosis were treated with intraluminal placement of balloon-expandable stents. Before treatment, 14 patients had intermittent claudication, and one had a limb at risk for amputation. One patient had diabetes mellitus, nine had hypertension, and all were long-term smokers. Two patients had surgical placement of the stent in one patient this was part of a combined revascularization procedure. All other stents were placed percutaneously. The transstenotic gradient after injection of vasodilating drugs distal to the lesion decreased from a mean of 32.3 mm Hg +/- 16.7 to 3.1 mm Hg +/- 4.2 after stent placement. Ankle-arm Doppler systolic pressure index increased from a mean of 0.68 +/- 0.22 to 0.96 +/- 0.24 after the procedure. The treatment eliminated intermittent claudication in 14 patients and increased exercise tolerance to 500 m in the patient with a limb at risk for amputation before the procedure. The improved condition persisted in all patients during the follow-up of 6-12 months. Stent placement may be a valuable adjunct in the management of iliac artery disease.
