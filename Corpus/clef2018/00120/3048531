Femorodistal vein bypass graft stenoses. Eighty femorodistal in situ vein bypass grafts have been evaluated at 3-monthly intervals clinically, with ankle:brachial pressure indices (ABI), by intravenous digital subtraction angiography (IV DSA) and by Duplex scanning. Five grafts (6 per cent) failed in the perioperative period. Nineteen (25 per cent) of the remaining 75 grafts subsequently developed stenoses on IV DSA during the first 12 months. All angiographic stenoses were detected by Duplex scanning using velocity ratio criteria before the development of symptoms or a measurable decline in ABI, i.e. while non-haemodynamically significant. This technique involves scanning the entire length of the graft but allows even minor stenoses to be detected and progression of stenoses can be determined. At a mean follow-up of 12 months (3-18 months), four (7 per cent) of the fifty-six grafts without stenoses occluded. Eight (42 per cent) of the nineteen stenosed grafts either occluded or developed symptoms. None of the occluded grafts in this series could be salvaged. Non-haemodynamically significant vein stenoses can be detected non-invasively, occur frequently and are associated with graft failure.
