Noninvasive and venographic diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis. Methods currently used to diagnose deep vein thrombosis (DVT) include contrast phlebography, the 125I-fibrinogen uptake test, Doppler ultrasound, and impedance plethysmography. Contrast phlebography, considered the "gold standard" for the diagnosis of DVT, provides excellent visualization of the entire deep, muscular, and superficial venous systems.
