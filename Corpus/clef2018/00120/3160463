Transluminal dilatation of the subclavian artery. Transluminal dilatation of seven left subclavian arteries and one right subclavian artery was attempted in seven patients. Dilatation was successful in four left subclavian arteries and the single right subclavian artery treated. Five of the patients suffered from cerebral symptoms as well as ischemia of the upper limb, one had only cerebral symptoms and another had only arm claudication. All patients also had significantly reduced systolic blood pressures in the brachial artery. Standard techniques for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) were employed, using the femoral route six times and the axillary route four times. No complications occurred. All patients were permanently given a maintenance dose of antiplatelet treatment with dipyridamole 75 mg tds after PTA. Follow-up of up to 36 months, indicates that angioplasty can be accomplished in the stenosed subclavian artery with relatively little hazard. Patients with hemodynamically significant stenoses should be considered for PTA if their symptoms and signs warrant such therapy.
