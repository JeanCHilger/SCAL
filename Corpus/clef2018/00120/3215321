Microvascular circulatory changes in the lower extremities after reconstructive vascular surgery for intermittent claudication. We have studied the circulatory changes in the lower extremities after reconstructive vascular surgery in ten patients with intermittent claudication. The following examinations were carried out 3 days before, 3 days, and 28 days after the operation: measurement of ankle systolic blood pressure, calf plethysmography, resting calf muscle blood flow and resting subcutaneous foot blood flow. The vasoconstrictor response (veno-arteriolar reflex) was also assessed. On the night before the operation and on the 28th night after aorto-bifemoral bypass surgery, subcutaneous adipose tissue blood flow in the forefoot was measured during sleep. The ankle systolic blood pressure and the ankle index rose significantly. The former increased from 57 +/- 16.4 mmHg to 93 +/- 24.0 mmHg (mean +/- S.E.M.) and was still elevated on the 28th postoperative day. The total limb blood flow, the muscle blood flow and the blood flow in the subcutaneous tissue of the forefoot during daytime were unchanged. In contrast, the blood flow in the forefoot during sleep increased significantly from 3.5 +/- 1.63 ml x (min x 100 g)-1 to 5.2 +/- 2.14 ml x (min x 100 g)-1 (mean +/- S.E.M.) on the 28th night. The vasoconstrictor response was potentiated, and increased from 27% before the operation to 45% on the third postoperative day. This change was maintained 28 days postoperatively. In conclusion the increase in arterial blood pressure was only reflected in the vasoconstrictor response which had returned to normal by the third postoperative day and nocturnal blood flow in the subcutaneous adipose tissue which did likewise.
