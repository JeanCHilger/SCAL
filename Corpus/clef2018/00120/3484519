Spinal cord stimulation in peripheral arterial disease. A cooperative study. Percutaneous epidural stimulation of the low thoracic spinal cord was carried out in 41 patients with pain from peripheral arterial disease of the lower limbs. Results are reported relating to pain, claudication distance, peripheral blood flow, and trophic lesion changes. Following a trial period of stimulation, 37 patients had stimulators permanently implanted. After a mean poststimulation follow-up period of 25 months, substantial pain relief (75% to 100%) was obtained in 29 cases claudication distance significantly increased in 15 cases
