Haemodynamic assessment of the femoropopliteal segment: comparison of pressure and Doppler methods using ROC curve analysis. Combined aorto-iliac and femoropopliteal vascular disease remains a problem in vascular surgery. Arteriography does not provide information on the relative contributions of the two lesions to the presenting symptoms. Aorto-iliac haemodynamics may reveal occult aorto-iliac disease but does not show whether combined proximal and distal reconstruction will be required to provide symptomatic relief. Haemodynamic assessment of both segments may help in this respect. A haemodynamic assessment of the femoropopliteal segment of 72 limbs in 38 patients is reported. The segmental pressure drop between a common femoral arterial cannula and a below-knee occlusion cuff is compared with a non-invasive Doppler method combining both transit time and damping factor. Comparison is made using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The measurement of segmental pressure drop is more accurate than the Doppler method in detection of femoropopliteal stenoses of greater than 50 per cent of the luminal diameter (P less than 0.05).
