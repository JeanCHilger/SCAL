Early diagnosis of femorodistal graft stenoses. Detection and early correction of stenoses following femorodistal bypass grafting may prevent graft occlusion. We studied 43 grafts (36 saphenous vein and 7 human umbilical vein) prospectively by peroperative angiography and then by clinical assessment, post-exercise Doppler ankle pressures and digital subtraction angiography at 1 week, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year. There were 11 grafts inserted for critical ischaemia, 16 for rest pain and 16 for disabling claudication. Four patients died within the year with five patient grafts and these were excluded from the final results. Eight grafts failed during the first year four within 1 month and a further four subsequently, with no warning alteration of symptoms, ankle Doppler pressure or digital subtraction angiography. Four additional grafts were jeopardized by symptomatic stenoses. Six grafts developed an asymptomatic stenosis of greater than 50 per cent without a change in exercising ankle Doppler pressure. Three symptomatic stenoses were successfully revised but the fourth occluded on conservative management. Three asymptomatic stenoses have also been successfully revised and three have been treated conservatively. Close surveillance of femorodistal grafts is justified by this study but a deterioration in ankle brachial Doppler index was only useful in the patients with recurrent symptoms and was unable to detect half the stenoses of greater than 50 per cent. The detection of these by intravenous digital subtraction angiography might help to avoid graft failure.
