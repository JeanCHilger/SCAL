Posterior compartment syndrome of the calf resulting from misdiagnosis of a rupture of the medial head of the gastrocnemius. Rupture of the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle has frequently been confused with thrombophlebitis. The distinction between these two entities is important and may be difficult to ascertain. Misdiagnosis may result in unnecessary complications. An illustrative case, in which venography, MRI, and compartment pressure measurements were diagnostic, is presented.
