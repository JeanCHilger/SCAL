Diagnosis of changes in supra-aortic extracranial vessels with special reference to collateral branches--real time sonography, Doppler ultrasound, angiography. High-resolution real-time sonography combined with continuous-wave Doppler for non-invasive screening of the supraaortal extracranial arteries was performed in 1133 patients during the last 13 months. The results of these techniques with regard to diagnosis of stenosis greater than or equal to 50%, complete occlusions and collateralization, are given and compared with 134 cerebral angiograms. The diagnostic information obtained can be used to differentiate between potentially surgically correctable lesions from those that require other medical therapy.
