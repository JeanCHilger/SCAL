Umbilical and uterine artery flow velocity waveforms in pregnancy associated with major fetal abnormality. Flow velocity waveforms from the umbilical artery and branches of the uterine artery in the placental bed were recorded using continuous wave Doppler ultrasound. The records of 26 patients with pregnancy complicated by major fetal abnormality were reviewed to determine the changes of a primary fetal disturbance. The systolic/diastolic (A/B) ratio was used as an index of blood flow resistance. In 13 of the 26 patients the umbilical artery waveform systolic/diastolic ratio was high. It is postulated that in these patients there is a process of obliteration of small arteries in the placenta that is triggered by the abnormal fetus. In all patients the uterine artery waveform was normal. In seven of these 13 patients the infant had a birthweight greater than 10th centile. Placental weights were examined. A small placenta expressed as either low weight for gestational age or low placental/fetal weight ratio was associated with a normal umbilical artery waveform. It is suggested that fetuses in these groups have a low growth potential. In contrast a high placental/fetal weight ratio was associated with an abnormal umbilical artery waveform pattern.
