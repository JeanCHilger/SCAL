Captopril for the treatment of patients with hypertension and peripheral vascular disease. Many epidemiological studies have shown up the frequent association of arterial hypertension (HT) with atherosclerosis of different localizations. However, many of the drugs used to treat HT are contraindicated in patients with peripheral vascular disease (PVD), because they cause unfavorable metabolic changes or vasoconstriction. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of a proven hypotensive drug, captopril, on the peripheral circulation. The drug appeared to be effective in improving blood flow to lower limbs, prolonging the pain. Free interval and increasing the angle/arm arterial pressure index.
