Differences in induction of the cellular switch mechanism of blood microcirculation in various organs and tissues of the human body. Different effects of a bad oxygen state of the organism on several organs an tissues as well as observed differences in their response to a lasting restoration of a good oxygen state by the Oxygen Multistep Therapy (O2MT) initiated the search for the (common) cause of these differences. From the view of our O2MT research, the organ- and tissue-specific different levels of the switching threshold of the bioenergetically controlled switching mechanism of blood microcirculation were suspected to be decisive. Observations discussed here revealed that this switching threshold is controlled by the local venous pO2 values and the capillary blood-flow. When the microcirculation is initially little changed (starting situation), the pathogenic lowering of microcirculation in different organs and tissues is mainly dependent on the venous oxygen partial pressure. From a scale containing venous pO2 values of different organs and tissues for two ages on can obtain the following order of succession with increasing pO2-ven: heart, lower extremities, brain (circulatory disorders), upper extremities, lungs, liver, stomach and bowel, skin, kidneys, spleen. This order agrees well with clinical findings on the frequency of diseases and disorders in different organs in relation to the increasingly insufficient oxygen state (progressing age). On the other hand, this sequence is also in good correlation with clinical observations, which are given here and show the abolition of pathogenic disturbances in different organs and tissues after "step-up" of microcirculation by means procedures of the O2MT. Finally, the abrogation of peripheral circulatory disorders of the lower extremities is discussed as a paradigm. The specific feature of this disease is to additionally weaken the oxygen state of the organism by the constraint in ability to move.
