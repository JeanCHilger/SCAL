Thrombophlebitis and thromboembolism: results of a prospective study. Thrombophlebitis leading to pulmonary embolism has been stated to cause as many as 9% of hospital deaths. Its diagnosis, sites of common occurrence, treatment and immediate sequelae have long been controversial subjects. A prospective study of thrombophlebitis was set up to evaluate these problems. One hundred and sixty-six patients diagnosed clinically as having thrombophlebitis or pulnmonary embolus were studied with the ultrasonic flow detector (doppler). To assess the stated accuracy of this instrument, venograms were done when possible. The doppler proved in this series to be 93% accurate as compared to venography which is comparable to other series. Pulmonary scans and angiograms were obtained from patients suspected of having pulmonary emboli. Results were as follows: 1) Of 113 patients suspected of having thrombophlebitis clinically, only 26 (23%) of the cases were confirmed by doppler 2) Of 53 patients suspected of having pulmonary embolus clinically, only 18 (34%) had confirmation by scan, angiogram or doppler
