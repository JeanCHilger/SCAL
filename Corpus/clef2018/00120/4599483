Isoxsuprine as an oral vasodilator. The effect of isoxsuprine, administered orally as a single 20-mg tablet, was compared with that of a placebo in a double-blind crossover study in 12 volunteers with and in 12 without peripheral vascular disease. Isoxsuprine failed to increase blood flow in the calf, foot or hand, and did not alter blood pressure or heart rate significantly. Claudication time was not prolonged after taking the drug. This study does not support the value of oral administration of isoxsuprine as a peripheral vasodilator.
