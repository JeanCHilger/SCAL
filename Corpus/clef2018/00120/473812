Comparative ultrasonic Doppler blood pressure determination on the upper and lower extremities as a possibility in the early detection and course observation of peripheral arterial circulatory disorders. The comparative measuring of blood pressure on the arm and foot artery by means of the ultrasound technique after Doppler is a method for the diagnostics of the disturbance of the peripheral arterial blood supply relevant to practice. Its advantages are in the short time of examination, the simple manipulation, the little technical expenditure and the providing of clear measuring data. The course of examination used by us is explained, the normal and borderline values got are reported. Patients with haemodynamically effective disturbances of the arterial blood supply of the vessels of the leg have on the malleolar artery a by more than 10 Torr lower blood pressure than on the brachial artery. For recognition of early changes we propose a simple loading test in form of a position test. The comparative ultrasound measuring of the blood pressure after Doppler on the upper and lower extremity is suitable for the observation of the course and should stand in the first place of the functional diagnostics of peripheral angioorganopathies.
