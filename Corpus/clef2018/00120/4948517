The erect posture as an aid to the circulation in the feet in the presence of arterial obstruction. When the main artery in the lower limb is occluded and narrow collateral vessels by-passing the obstruction offer the limiting resistance to blood flow, the increase in arterial pressure at the ankle on assuming the erect posture is greater than would be predicted by consideration of the hydrostatic factors. In seven patients with femoral artery occlusion the pressure at the ankle was greater than expected in all and on the average by 8.0 mm. Hg+/-1.5 S.E. when sitting, (P<0.01) and in the four patients tested, by 12.4 mm. Hg+/-0.5 S.E. when standing (P<0.01). Rate of blood flow in subdermal tissue of the forefoot estimated by xenon-133 clearance was an average of 21% less when sitting than when supine in five limbs of four normal subjects while in five limbs with occlusion or severe stenosis of the superficial femoral artery the rate of flow was an average of 44% greater.
