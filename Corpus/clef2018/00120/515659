Alleviation of pain via lidocain in peripheral arteriography. Further experiences (author's transl). On comparing an ionic contrast medium with a contrast medium containing one or two mg Lidocain/ml contrast medium, the one with the higher Lidocain addition was found to be most effective in respect of pain alleviation. The feeling of flush could not be favourably influenced. The use of a higher dose of Lidocain in the contrast medium may involve more pronounced circulatory reactions, such as drop in blood pressure and enhanced pulse rate. Besides, the rate of side effects compared with the use of the pure contrast medium and contrast medium with one mg Lidocain/ml CM will be increased. For this reason, it is not recommended to add more than 1 mg/ml Lidocain to the contrast medium. In most cases, repeat examinations can be effected without any risk with 1 mg Lidocain/ml contrast medium. No absolute contraindications were found in the application to outpatients and risk patients. Relative contraindication exists in patients with bradycardia and bradyarrhythmia. Following preliminary injection of a vasodilatory substance, the Lidocain/contrast medium mixture is well suited for arteriography in the arm.
