Coarctation of the abdominal aorta: diagnosis, pathogenesis, medical or surgical treatment. 7 cases. Seven cases of coarctation of the abdominal aorta are reported. The diagnosis, suggested by the presence of arterial hypertension associated with nonperception of the arterial pulse in the lower limbs and/or systolic murmur in the abdomen, is supported by non-invasive investigations, such as DÃ¶ppler flowmetry of lower limb arteries and ultrasonography of the abdominal aorta. Arteriography, however, is mandatory because of frequently associated lesions of other arteries, notably renal and/or intestinal arteries. The type and location of these lesions are of prime importance to therapeutic decision. According to the results of the present study, surgery may not be required in all cases and may be replaced, in some very specific circumstances, by medical treatment. There is still disagreement concerning the congenital or acquired origin of this type of aortic coarctation and the mechanism of hypertension. The various theories put forward are discussed.
