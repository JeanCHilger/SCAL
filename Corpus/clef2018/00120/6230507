Comparison of two laser Doppler flowmeters for the monitoring of dermal blood flow. Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) is a noninvasive and continuous method of monitoring dermal blood flow in free flaps. There are two LDFs available for clinical application: the LD5000 Laser Doppler Perfusion Monitor and the Periflux Laser Doppler Flowmeter. Varying degrees of arterial (N = 46) and venous (N = 28) occlusion were induced in saphenous island flaps of the dog, while simultaneous measurements with the LD5000 and Periflux LDFs were made. The millivoltage output of both the LD5000 and the Periflux showed a high degree of correlation with arterial and venous occlusion and with each other.
