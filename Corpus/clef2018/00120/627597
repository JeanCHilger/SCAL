Effect of intra-arterial reserpine in patients suffering from Raynaud's phenomenon. Several papers have established the beneficial effect of Reserpine applied intra-arterially in patients suffering from Raynaud's phenomenon. In the present study this effect was investigated in 15 patients, some of whom had been submitted previously to sympathectomy, and in healthy controls. A solution of 1.25 mg Reserpine in 10 ml normal saline was injected in the course of one minute in the brachial artery. Blood pressure, pulse rate, bilateral finger venous occlusion plethysmography and fingertip temperature measurements were carried out for two hours following the injection. Later, venous occlusion plethysmographic and clinical controls were continued weekly, until the Reserpine effect had ceased. Normal subjects, patients suffering from Raynaud's phenomenon undergoing no surgical treatment and those submitted to preganglionic sympathectomy showed a conspicuous increase in digital blood flow, while in one patient, who had stellectomy the fingerflow remained unchanged. This effect remained chiefly located on the injected side. There were no blood pressure or pulse rate changes while in the lying position. Hypotension by passive orthostasis was observed two hours after the injection. The possible mechanism of Reserpine is discussed.
