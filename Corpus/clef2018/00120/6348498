Comparison of ultrasound scanning/Doppler with digital subtraction angiography in evaluating carotid arterial disease. A study was conducted to evaluate the accuracy of a duplex ultrasound system, combining real-time imaging with pulsed Doppler flow analysis, in detecting and quantifying carotid arteriosclerosis. Vessels were graded as normal, mildly stenotic, moderately stenotic, severely stenotic, or occluded, and results were compared with similarly graded conventional or digital subtraction angiograms. Absolute agreement was found for 151 of 190 vessels (79.5%). Good correlation, in which the duplex examination result was within one grade of severity of the angiographic interpretation, was noted in 34 vessels (17.9%). Five vessels (2.6%) showed poor correlation--three false-positives caused by overinterpretation of disturbed Doppler flow signals, and two false-negatives caused by misinterpretation of images. The duplex examination appears to reliably quantify carotid arteriosclerosis and should provide a valuable noninvasive diagnostic and screening tool.
