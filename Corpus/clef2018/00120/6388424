The effectiveness of isoxsuprine in patients with intermittent claudication. Sixty male patients with intermittent claudication were investigated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in order to determine the effectiveness of Isoxsuprine. The analysis of the results was made on the basis of subjective assessment of symptoms by the patients themselves and also on the results of segmental blood-pressure measurements and ankle/arm indices at rest and after standardised exercise. Significant differences were demonstrated between the active and placebo groups as regards pain-free walking distance although arterial pressure measurements did not show statistically significant differences between the two groups. Isoxsuprine appears to be significantly beneficial only for patients with obstructions at the femoro-popliteal level.
