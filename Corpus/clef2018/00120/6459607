Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for limb salvage. Thirty patients with end-stage atherosclerosis, being considered for amputation, were treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). All had very poor run-off, and none was a candidate for arterial reconstruction. Occluded segments of the iliac, femoral, popliteal, and tibial arteries measuring up to 21 cm were recanalized, resulting in an increased ankle/brachial systolic pressure index despite significant distal occlusive disease. Ischemic symptoms were relieved in 22 patients, and the overall limb salvage rate (2- to 17-month follow-up) was 73%.
