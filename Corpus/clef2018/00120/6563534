Effectiveness of health promotion interventions. The purpose of the study was to determine whether patients who participated in an intervention program would improve exercise and foot-care habits, reduce smoking, and would, in turn, have fewer PVD-related illnesses than patients not exposed to the intervention. Eighty-six patients with ankle/brachial pressure indices of less than 1.0 on one or both legs were randomly assigned to a study (N = 42) or control (N = 44) group. All patients were assessed on a variety of health-related and activity behaviors prior to and again 26 weeks after enrollment in the study. Study patients who participated in the intervention worked with professionals on selecting programs designed to modify and improve their smoking, exercise, and/or foot-care habits. At the end of 26 weeks, chi-square analysis showed no significant differences between study and control groups on change in smoking and foot care, although the results were in the anticipated direction. Study patients who chose to increase their exercise showed greater increase than control patients in frequency (p = .001), distance (p = .007), and length (p = .002) of walks. Although behaviors were modified, especially in the area of exercise, it was felt that longer interventions on a larger sample size are needed.
