Transcutaneous detection of subcritical arterial stenoses by Doppler signal spectrum analysis. Early clinical studies showed significant data overlap when Doppler signal spectral analysis was used to differentiate normal carotid vessels from those with slight stenoses. A canine common carotid model has been used to study the ability of spectral analysis to detect subcritical stenoses, i.e., those with 20 to 50 per cent diameter reductions. Using the ratio of peak systolic frequency at the stenosis site to that proximal to the stenosis, significant differences from controls were found for all degrees of stenosis. The mean peak frequency ratio was 1.15 +/- 0.05 for 20 per cent stenoses, increasing to 1.68 +/- 0.50 for 50 per cent stenoses. The peak frequency ratios for Doppler signal spectra recorded from a site 1 cm distal to the stenosis exceeded control values only for 40 and 50 per cent stenoses at a site 3 cm from the stenosis no spectra were significantly different from controls. Spectral analysis can be a direct, sensitive method to evaluate slight carotid arterial stenoses, but careful examination technique is necessary and Doppler signals must be taken from the stenotic site itself.
