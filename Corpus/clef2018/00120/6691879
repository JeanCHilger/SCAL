Effect of varying methods of upper limb occlusion on fibrinolytic activity in man. Three techniques of intermittent venous occlusion (an oscillotonometer cuff, pneumatic leggings and an automatic arterial pressure monitoring cuff (Sentinel] were applied to one upper limb of seven healthy male volunteers. Fibrinolytic activity was assessed by the measurement of the euglobulin clot lysis time during a control period followed by 1 h of intermittent venous occlusion. Although no statistically significant differences were found with any of the methods, between the control and experimental periods, there was a trend towards fibrinolytic enhancement with intermittent pneumatic compression.
