Sitting orthosis for patient with bilateral hip disarticulation. A special sitting orthosis was designed and fitted for a 59-year-old patient with right-side hemiplegia and expressive aphasia who underwent bilateral hip disarticulation due to peripheral vascular disease involving both lower extremities. The orthosis prevented the patient from sliding down in the wheelchair and allowed him to sit comfortably and safely with even weight distribution that prevented formation of pressure sores. Without the orthosis, the patient was unable to sit in a wheelchair without hazardous sliding. It also helped him sitting in bed. The orthosis, strapped to the back of an amputee wheelchair equipped with an antitipping extension aid, permitted the patient to sit safely upright in a relaxed position, wheel himself more easily, use a desk arm if desired to feed himself, read, or perform other activities. The patient, when secured in the orthosis, also could be lifted easily and placed into any chair, bed, or even on the floor.
