Compartment syndromes of the lower extremities (author's transl). A reduction of the arterial blood pressure of the muscles of the 4 tight fascial compartments of the shank may be initiated by: Trauma and operation of the lower extremities, spontaneous bleeding, occlusion of the arteries, general and local hypotonia due to elevation of the leg, as well as by drug abuse and increased stress of the muscles of the lower extremities. This is followed by an increased swelling and tension of the tissue with ischemia and consecutive paralyses of the nerves and muscles in the presence of almost simultaneous muscle contractures. We may encounter a double insult, a "rebound" effect, if f.i. following removal of a two thigh bandage of the shank the compartment again becomes too narrow due to a postischemic swelling. The anterior tibial syndrome is frequently caused by an increased exertion in sports and in the military service. The dorsal syndromes are often accompanied by Sudeck's dystrophy in the late stages. In treatment the early and extensive longitudinal incision of the respective fasciae is imperative in order to prevent the typical equino-varus deformity and hallux flexus.
