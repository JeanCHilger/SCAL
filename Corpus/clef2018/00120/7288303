Arguments for and description of the Doppler venous examination (author's transl). Analysis of blood flow rates by Doppler effect on veins has many advantages: deep insertion of venous catheters, diagnosis of deep veins thrombosis, venous insufficiency, right heart cardiopathies, and supervision of medical and surgical treatment of venous disease. The agreement between Doppler examination and phlebography was, in venous thrombosis, 86.5 % for 110 examinations. Sensitivity of Doppler technique is 86%, specificity 91 %. If used to check permeability of vena cava interruption, concordance between Doppler ultrasound and isotopic phlebography was 90 % for 32 cases. The main limitation of the method is a poor sensibility in diagnosis of distal thrombosis and in not entirely occluding clots.
