Multiple level arterial occlusions of the leg. Reliability of indirect thigh pressures in the assessment of proximal arterial obstruction. 19 patients with obstructive arterial disease both proximal and distal to the inguinal ligament were studied with segmental blood pressure recordings because reconstruction of the proximal lesion was considered. The common femoral pressure was measured intraarterially as well as with a 12 cm cuff placed as proximally as possible on the thigh. The proximal pressures measured by the two techniques were found to correlate well. Thus, the atraumatic cuff pressure technique is validated which can be of use in evaluating multilevel occlusions and the associated run off problem involved in partial proximal reconstruction.
