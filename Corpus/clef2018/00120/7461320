Maximal walking tolerance evaluated by graded treadmill exercise in femoral and iliac obstruction (author's transl). The Authors evaluated by graded speed treadmill exercise the maximal walking tolerance in two groups of patients with isolated obstruction of femoral (15 cases) and iliac (11 cases) respectively, recognized by non invasive methods. Clinical and instrumental patterns at rest were nearly the same. In the two groups studied the following data have been considered: ankle systolic pressure at rest, arm-thigh pressure gradient, pressure index, maximum walking tolerance and baseline pressure recovery time after exercise. Mean and standard deviation of each parameter were calculated statistical significance of the observed differences was tested by Student's t test. Since walking tolerance resulted significantly higher (p < 0.01) in femoral obstructions, factors associated with the level of the obstructive lesion are analyzed and discussed, which can explain such functional behaviour.
