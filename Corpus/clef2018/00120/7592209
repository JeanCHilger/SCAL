Reactive hyperemia unmasks reduced compliance of cutaneous arteries in essential hypertension. To evaluate changes in distal cutaneous arteries during hypertension, we used a noninvasive method to assess the compliance and vascular resistance of the hand radial arteries, mainly distributed to the skin, in 10 normotensive and 10 hypertensive (HT) men. Radial artery diameter and blood velocity were measured by means of pulsed Doppler concomitantly with measurements of finger arterial pressure by photoplethysmography. Hand radial vascular resistance was calculated as the ratio of mean arterial pressure to mean radial blood flow. A simple resistive-capacitive model of large and small arteries of the hand allowed us to evaluate arterial compliance from the exponential slope of finger diastolic pressure decay and vascular resistance. Measurements were made at baseline and during reactive hyperemia after 5 min of complete occlusion of the brachial artery with a pneumatic cuff. Except for pressure, there were no baseline differences between the groups. In normotensive and HT subjects, hyperemia increased radial artery diameter and blood velocity (P < 0.001) and compliance (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively) and decreased mean pressure (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively) and resistance (P < 0.001). During hyperemia, the only difference between the groups, except for pressure, was lower compliance in HT subjects (P < 0.01). Moreover, compliance during hyperemia negatively correlated with baseline mean pressure (P = 0.001). Thus hyperemia unmasked reduced compliance in the HT patients but did not show abnormal resistance, suggesting that the elastic properties of the hand skin radial arteries might be more sensitive than their resistive properties to high blood pressure.
