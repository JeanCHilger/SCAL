Use of pulsating high-frequency electromagnetic fields in patients with diabetic neuropathies and angiopathies. High-frequency pulsating electromagnetic field therapy was carried out in 22 patients with diabetic polyneuropathy and angiopathy manifested on lower extremities (18 men, 4 women, aged 48.2 +/- 6.3 years 10 insulin-dependent persons, and 12 on oral antidiabetic treatment). The aim of the study was to verify the effect of this therapy on symptoms, neurophysiological findings and peripheral circulation. The diagnose of diabetic polyneuropathy was based on the electromyographic examination of foot and calf muscles, measurement of motor nerve conduction velocity of peroneal and tibial nerve, and sensory nerve conduction velocity of sural nerve. Diagnosis of diabetic polyneuropathy was based on electromyographic examination of the foot and calf muscles, measurement of the motor nerve conduction velocity of peroneal and tibial nerves, and the sensory nerve conduction velocity of the sural nerve. Diagnosis of diabetic angiopathy was established by oscillometric examination, measurement of skin temperature and claudication distance. The same methods were used for the evaluation of the therapeutical effect of electromagnetic field. Significant improvement of symptoms, and of all registered parameters of peripheral circulation was established after the therapy, but there were no significant changes of neurophysiological parameters. Therefore, high-frequency pulsating electromagnetic field is recommended for the treatment of diabetic angiopathy. In patients with neuropathic changes it can be used as an introduction procedure, or as an additional procedure to physical agents which are commonly used in the treatment of peripheral nerve lesion.
