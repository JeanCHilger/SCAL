Xanthinol nicotinate in peripheral vascular disease. In a double-blind control of xanthinol nicotinate ('Complamin' 'Complamex') in patients with severe progressive obliterative vascular disease, 25 of 33 patients who completed the trial were helped significantly by the drug, as shown by both clinical and laboratory findings. Placebo helped in 4 of 33 patients. The difference is significant (p less than 0-001). These are the results for the trial period only. The results of follow-up for 6 to 30 months are available in 18 patients: 14 of these still had appreciable help from the drug, which was continued in maintenance doses. It should be noted that 3 of 6 diabetics were no longer helped after 6 months, and that only 3 of a total of 7 patients under the age of 50 were helped
