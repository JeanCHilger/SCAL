Comparison of technical measuring methods for the diagnosis of arterial occlusive disease of the lower extremities (author's transl). Four technical methods of measurement were used simultaneously in angiographically established occlusions of the iliac artery (n = 9), long occlusions of the superficial femoral artery (n = 22), stenoses of the superficial femoral artery (n =14), isolated occlusions of the arteries of the lower limb (n = 6) and in an arteriographically inconspicuous control group (n = 11). The following parameters were used for the analysis of variance: time for return of resting pulse amplitude for oscillography under exertion, difference between arterial pressure in the arm and ankle for the ultrasonic Doppler pressure measurement, peak flow after arterial oppression for venous occlusion plethysmography and pressure equilibration time for the peripheral phlebodynamometry. All four methods were suitable for the differentiation of extremities with and without arterial insufficiency with greater statistical significance (p smaller than 0,001). Venous occlusion plethysmography appears to be particularly suitable for scientific problems. Ultrasonic Doppler pressure measurement is available as the method of choice for the rapid and reliable detection of arterial insufficiency.
