Arterial vascular diagnosis by Doppler pulse curve analysis of the first dorsal metatarsal artery. In patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease diagnostics by Doppler-sonography at the toe arteries and by Doppler-pressure measurement at the ankle arteries is often difficult and sometimes impossible. Using the first dorsal metatarsal artery for Doppler-waveform analysis yields exact information on haemodynamically relevant circulatory disturbances. Painful ulcers, gangrene, oedemata, mediasclerosis, burns, plaster casts, posttraumatic or postoperative conditions prevent the application of cuffs at the lower leg or foot. This Doppler-waveform analysis evidently represents the degree and the specialties of a disturbed blood circulation and allows an additional assessment of the vessels distal from the ankle arteries and enables a functional test on the anastomosis of the artery tibialis posterior and the artery dorsalis pedis. Functional and pharmacological influences on the tone of the vessels can be shown. The typical diagnostic features of Doppler-wave-form analysis used at the proximal measuring points are also valid at the dorsal metatarsal artery. The results of own comparative investigations in 69 patients and 44 healthy test persons are demonstrated.
