Do beta-blockers cause vasospasm? The action of beta-blockers on papillary blood flow is quite controversial. Because there is a known relationship between digital and ocular vasospasm, we measured digital blood flow by laser-Doppler methods as a peripheral index of ocular vasospastic disorders. Thus, the effects of cardioselective (betaxolol) and noncardioselective (timolol) beta-blockers on peripheral blood flow in healthy volunteers were evaluated. Neither beta-blocker lowered peripheral blood flow for betaxolol, there was even a significant increase compared to no medication. No significant differences between betaxolol and timolol were seen.
