Thrombosis of the portal venous system after splenectomy for pediatric hematologic disease. Splenic, portal, or mesenteric venous thrombosis after splenectomy for hematologic disease has not been reported in the pediatric literature. It is a rare complication associated with significant morbidity and mortality in adult reports. Between 1981 and 1991, 3 patients (13-year-old boy with hereditary elliptocytosis [HE], 13-year-old boy with thalassemia intermedia [TI], and 18-year-old girl with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura [ITP]) presented with abdominal pain, nausea, with or without fever, at 4, 11, and 13 days postsplenectomy, respectively. Abdominal Doppler ultrasound (US) and/or computed tomography (CT) showed: (1) an intraluminal filling defect with partial obstruction to flow in the right branch of the portal vein with the remaining vessels patent (HE) (2) splenic vein thrombosis with complete occlusion of the main portal vein and proximal superior mesenteric vein (TI)
