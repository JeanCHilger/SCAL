Reflex sympathetic dystrophy and repetitive strain injury: temperature and microcirculatory changes following mild cold stress. Temperature and blood flow studies were performed in the upper limbs of six patients with reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), nine patients with repetitive strain injury (RSI) and 12 control subjects using thermography, laser Doppler flowmetry, infrared photoplethysmography and venous occlusion strain gauge plethysmography. The contralateral responses of the symptomatic and asymptomatic limbs were examined after being subjected, separately, to mild cold stress (20 degrees C for 1 min). Altered thermoregulation and haemodynamics were evident in RSD. Though the pattern of response to contralateral cold challenge is similar to normal in RSI, vasodilatation and reduced vasomotion appears to be characteristic in this condition. Such changes may assist in distinguishing between RSD and RSI from other causes of chronic upper limb pain.
