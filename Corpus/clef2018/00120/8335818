Clinical trial of percutaneous peripheral ultrasound angioplasty. The purpose of this study was to present follow-up data as well as short-term results on a larger clinical series of patients undergoing ultrasound angioplasty.Previous pilot studies have demonstrated the feasibility of peripheral arterial ultrasound angioplasty.We performed percutaneous ultrasound angioplasty on 50 arterial lesions in 45 patients. Our ultrasound ablation system had a frequency of 19.5 kHz. A fixed-wire probe with 2- or 3-mm ball tips and a 3-mm over-the-wire probe were used to treat 40 femoral, 7 popliteal and 3 tibioperoneal lesions. Seventeen (34%) of the lesions were calcific. Thirty (86%) of 35 occluded segments, 0.5 to 28 cm long (mean 6.2 +/- 5.7), were recanalized.In the 45 patent arteries, the stenosis decreased from 94 +/- 10% to 55 +/- 23% after ultrasound angioplasty and to 12 +/- 8% after balloon angioplasty. Mechanical arterial dissections (n = 4) and perforations (n = 4) without clinical consequence occurred only with the fixed non-over-the-wire probes. No evidence of embolism or vasospasm was detected in fact, vasodilation occurred. There were no clinical manifestations of acute reocclusion. At 24 h, ankle-brachial indexes increased by 0.23 +/- 0.21 (range -0.27 to 0.72). Six- to 12-month clinical and ankle-brachial index follow-up data for 35 patients treated with ultrasound and adjunctive balloon angioplasty were indicative of restenosis in 7 patients (20%).Our findings indicate that percutaneous peripheral ultrasound angioplasty 1) is useful for recanalization of fibrous, calcific and thrombotic arterial occlusions 2) reduces arterial stenoses
