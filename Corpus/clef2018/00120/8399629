Does continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis induce hypercholesterolemia? Hypercholesterolemia has been recognized as a significant risk factor for atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of hypercholesterolemia and the role, if any, of type of dialysis. In 19 hemodialysis (HD) and 20 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) subjects, body weight, body mass index (BMI), arm muscle area (AMA), total cholesterol (C), HDL and LDL fractions, triglycerides, C/HDL ratio, glycosylated hemoglobin, and apolipoproteins AI, AII, B, CII, CIII, and E were evaluated. Hypercholesterolemia was defined as cholesterol greater than 220 mg/dL and LDL greater than 150 mg/dL. Body weight, body mass index, and arm muscle area were higher (p < 0.05) in CAPD as compared with HD so were total cholesterol, LDL, C/HDL ratio, and glycosylated hemoglobin (Hbalc). Hypercholesterolemia prevalence was 3/19 in HD and 11/20 in CAPD (p < 0.05). A relationship between Hbalc and C/HDL ratio was found in the CAPD group (r = 0.48
