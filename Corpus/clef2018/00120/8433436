The relation of venous ulceration with ambulatory venous pressure measurements. Two hundred thirty-six limbs of 220 unselected patients who were admitted with venous problems (83 with ulcers) were studied with continuous-wave Doppler ultrasonography, duplex scanning, and ambulatory venous pressure measurements. Patients with evidence of deep venous disease because of reflux or obstruction in the deep veins on Doppler and duplex ultrasonic examination or with an ambulatory venous pressure greater than 45 mm Hg despite the ankle cuff had venography. One hundred fifty-three limbs had superficial venous disease (reflux in the superficial veins with competent popliteal valves), and 83 limbs had deep venous disease (popliteal reflux on duplex examination or deep venous obstruction on venography). No ulceration occurred in limbs with ambulatory venous pressure < 30 mm Hg, and there was a 100% incidence with ambulatory venous pressure > 90 mm Hg. A linear increase occurred from 14% in limbs with ambulatory venous pressure between 31 and 40 mm Hg to 100% in limbs with ambulatory venous pressure greater than 90 mm Hg (r = 0.79). In the groups studied, an increased incidence of ulceration was associated with an increase in ambulatory venous pressure irrespective of whether the venous problem was the result of superficial or deep venous disease. Ambulatory venous pressure has both diagnostic and prognostic significance in patients with venous disease.
