Hemodynamic effects of plasma exchange in septic patients: preliminary report. To assess the effects of plasma exchange on the hemodynamic performance of septic patients, we studied 12 septic patients (11 males and 1 female, age range 19-64, mean 39 +/- 17 years). After cardiovascular stabilization, plasma exchange was performed in the spontaneous mode via a femorofemoral arteriovenous shunt during the treatment the infusion rate of cardiovascular drugs and the mechanical ventilation setting were not modified. Heart rate, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, and peripheral vascular resistance did not change significantly. The stroke volume index increased significantly (from 49 +/- 9 to 60 +/- 9 ml/min/m2
