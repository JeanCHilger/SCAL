Increased formation of reactive oxygen species after permanent and reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat. In barbiturate-anesthetized rats, we induced 3 hours of permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) by an intraluminal thread (n = 6), or 1 hour MCAO followed by 2 hours of reperfusion (n = 6). Through a closed cranial window over the parietal cortex, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured in the infarct border using online in vivo chemiluminescence (CL) while monitoring the appearance of peri-infarct depolarizations (PID). The borderzone localization of the ROS and direct current (DC) potential measurements was confirmed in additional experiments using laser-Doppler scanning, mapping regional CBF changes through the cranial window after permanent (n = 5) or reversible (n = 5) MCAO. CL measurements revealed a short period (10 to 30 minutes) of reduced ROS formation after vessel occlusion, followed by a significant increase (to 162 +/- 51% baseline = 100%
