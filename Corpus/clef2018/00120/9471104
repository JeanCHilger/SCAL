The effect of extending mild hypothermia on focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion in the rat. The aim of the present study is to compare the influence of timing and duration of mild hypothermia on rats subjected to 3 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by 72 h of reperfusion. Sixty-four Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three mild hypothermic groups according to the duration of mild hypothermia (MHT 32 +/- 0.2 degrees C): intra-ischemia (MHTi) intra-reperfusion (MHTr)
