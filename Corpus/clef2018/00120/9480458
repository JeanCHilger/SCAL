Misoprostol--oral prostanoid--the first clinical trial for use in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Misoprostol, the oral analogue of alprostadil was used for the treatment of 20 patients (aged 40-60) with peripheral arterial disease according to Fontaine's classification at stages IIa and IIb (PAD). All patients received 200 micrograms of misoprostol 3 times a day during a month. The therapy with misoprostol resulted in a clinical improvement in all patients. Elongation of pain free (before treatment 129 m +/- 78 m, after treatment 214 m +/- 109 m) and maximum walking distance (before treatment 304 m +/- 169 m, after treatment 471 m +/- 264 m) was observed. At the same time a shortening of the pain duration was noted (before treatment 100 sec +/- 37 sec, after treatment 71 sec +/- 23 sec). The ankle/arm pressure ratio (AAPR) and arterial blood flow increased in both limbs after 4 weeks of the treatment. Activation of the fibrinolytic system was seen in the course of the therapy (shortening of euglobulin clot lysis time-ECLT and increase in t-PA activity). The platelets became less sensitive to ADP and collagen after intake of misoprostol. The results justify administration of misoprostol as a new therapeutic agent for the treatment of patients with PAD.
