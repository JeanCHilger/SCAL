Treatment of severe Raynaud's syndrome by injection of autologous blood pretreated by heating, ozonation and exposure to ultraviolet light (H-O-U) therapy. To determine the effect of re-injection of small samples of autologous blood, pretreated with heat, ozone and ultraviolet light (H-O-U therapy) in patients with severe Raynaud's syndrome.Open trial in 4 patients.Temperature/humidity controlled vascular laboratory.Severe Raynaud's syndrome of more than 5 years duration and defined as more than 5 attacks daily or 10 attacks in one week, at least half of which were painful and lasting for more than 30 minutes. Three patients were refractory to infusions of Iloprost.Patients were treated daily or on alternate days for a two to three weeks period by re-injection of citrated autologous blood pre-treated with heat, ozone and ultraviolet light (H-O-U therapy).Clinical observations mean equilibrated hand temperature (infrared thermography)Reduction or abolition of Raynaud's attacks for at least three months after treatment. Mean equilibrated hand temperature increased but did not normalise. Blood flow parameters improved but did not reach statistical significance. Iontophoresis of acetylcholine showed an increase in laser Doppler flowmetry which was statistically significant. Serum levels of 6-keto-PGF1alpha, fell significantly in three patients. Serum levels of anti-hsp65 antibody fell in the one patient which was followed sequentially.H-O-U therapy may prove useful in patients with severe Raynaud's syndrome.
