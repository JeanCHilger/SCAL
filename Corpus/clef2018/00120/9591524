Relationship between free-living daily physical activity and ambulatory measures in older claudicants. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between free-living daily physical activity and ambulatory measurements in peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) patients with intermittent claudication. Thirty-four older, nonsmoking PAOD patients with intermittent claudication (age=69.0 +/- 6.0 years, ankle/brachial index [ABI] =0.63 +/- 0.18) were recruited from the Vascular Clinic at the Baltimore Veterans Affairs Medical Center and from radio and newspaper advertisements. Energy expenditure of physical activity (EEPA) was determined by using doubly labeled water and indirect calorimetry techniques. Patients were also characterized on claudication distances and peak oxygen uptake during a graded treadmill test, 6-minute walking distance, weight, body mass index, and percent body fat. The claudication patients were sedentary, as EEPA was 362 +/- 266 kcal/day. EEPA was related to the 6-minute walk distance (369 +/- 68 meters r=0.629, P<0.001), to the number of steps taken during 6 minutes (605 +/- 99 steps
