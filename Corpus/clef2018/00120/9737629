Three-dimensional vascular imaging using Doppler ultrasound. We have evaluated the efficacy of using three-dimensional reconstruction of amplitude Doppler imaging data to quantitatively assess carotid artery bifurcation stenoses.Sixty-four consecutive frames of amplitude (power) Doppler images are stored to be reassembled into a three-dimensional image representing the patent lumen. These images can then be rotated by any angle necessary to clearly view the vascular anatomy and to make quantitative ultrasound caliper measurements of the stenotic lumen and normal vessel caliber.Three-dimensional Doppler images accurately classified 53 of 61 vessels (87%) into categories of stenosis compared with angiography. All stenoses with >60% diameter reduction were detected and classified as such, for a sensitivity of 100%.Three-dimensional vascular imaging based on amplitude (power) Doppler data provides an accurate noninvasive technique for quantitative diagnosis of carotid bifurcation atherosclerotic disease, with selectable viewing projections that eliminate vessel overlap and other artifacts, and complements the hemodynamic data already available with two-dimensional duplex ultrasound.
