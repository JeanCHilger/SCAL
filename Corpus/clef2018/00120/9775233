The effects of carotid endarterectomy on ocular haemodynamics. To determine the profile of blood flow velocities and resistive indices in the ocular vessels of patients with atherosclerotic carotid disease and characterise the effect of endarterectomy on these parameters.Following a preliminary study on healthy volunteers, ophthalmic colour Doppler ultrasound examinations were performed on 27 male and 11 female patients with carotid disease. These measurements were compared with central retinal artery perfusion pressures and intraoperative internal carotid artery stump pressures.Significant changes were seen on the endarterectomised side. The peak systolic velocity in the ophthalmic artery, and resistive indices in the ophthalmic artery, central retinal artery and nasal posterior ciliary artery, rose from pre-operative values. No correlation between colour Doppler ultrasound measurements and intraoperative internal carotid artery stump pressures was present. When compared with ophthalmodynamometry readings, a relationship was noted with maximum velocities in the central retinal vein.Carotid endarterectomy alters the haemodynamics in selected vessels of the ocular circulation as measured by colour Doppler ultrasound, but more work is required to determine the clinical utility of this investigative modality.
