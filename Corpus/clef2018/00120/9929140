Ultrasonographic screening for arterial occlusive disease in the pelvis and lower extremities. To evaluate the accuracy of pulsed Doppler ultrasound (PDUS) and color Doppler ultrasound (CDUS) for the screening of arterial occlusive disease in the pelvis and lower extremities.We studied 52 patients with intermittent claudication or lower extremity "coolness." Pulsed Doppler waveforms were measured in the inguinal and popliteal regions and were classified according to their pattern. Patients with abnormal waveforms underwent subsequent CDUS evaluation from the aortic bifurcation to the popliteal arteries. All patients also underwent conventional angiography.All stenoses (> 50%) and occlusions on angiography were detected by PDUS. The combination of PDUS and CDUS allowed detection of 78.0% of stenotic lesions (> 50% narrowing) and 96.6% of occlusive lesions in the iliofemoral regions and in 100% of stenotic lesions (> 50% narrowing) and occlusive lesions in the femoropopliteal regions. PDUS required approximately 3 min. About more 5 min are required when CDUS was added.Combined PDUS and CDUS appears to be a rapid, highly sensitive means of screening for arterial occlusive disease in the pelvis and lower extremities.
