PTLA (percutaneous transluminal laser angioplasty) recanalization of femoral artery stenoses/occlusions after Angio-Seal administration. To demonstrate desobliration of Angio-Seal-induced femoral artery stenosis and occlusion by Excimer-laser assisted angioplasty and PTA.The Angio-Seal hemostatic closure device was applied to the puncture site in 1500 patients after diagnostic or therapeutic coronary artery catheterisation. In 5 of 1500 cases symptoms of claudication occurred. Following the determination of the walking distance and ankle-brachial systolic pressure index (ABI) and diagnostic angiography, therapeutic percutaneous transluminal laser angioplasty (PTLA) and PTA was performed.5 patients with acute symptoms of peripheral artery disease presented with superficial femoral artery occlusions (three cases) and high grade stenoses of the common femoral arteries (two cases). Angiographic and clinical improvement was achieved after PTLA/PTA in all five patients. The mean walking distance increased from 61 meters to 600 meters. The average ankle-brachial systolic pressure index increased from 0.40 to 0.82.PTLA/PTA is a satisfactory therapeutic method for femoral artery occlusion or high-grade stenosis following Angio-Seal application.
