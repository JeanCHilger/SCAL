Dissociation between albuminuria and insulinaemia in hypertensive and atherosclerotic men. To better understand the links between circulating insulin and albuminuria in essential hypertension, the plasma insulin response t alpha a 75 gram glucose load and albuminuria were evaluated in 53 glucose-tolerant essential hypertensives and 12 controls. To allow any direct pressure-independent albuminuric effect of insulin to emerge more clearly, those same parameters were also evaluated in 20 glucose-tolerant normotensive patients with stable atherosclerotic peripheral vascular disease, a condition in which hyperinsulinaemia could be anticipated on the basis of previous reports. In response to glucose ingestion, hyperinsulinaemia was evident in both hypertensive and normotensive atherosclerotic patients, while, on average, urine albumin was elevated only in the former. When plasma insulin, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) (by 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring), plasma glucose, triglycerides and body mass index were entered into a multiple regression analysis, only systolic BP appeared to exert an independent effect on urine albumin. Post-glucose load plasma insulin did not differ between hypertensive patients with (n = 14) and without (n = 39) microalbuminuria (albuminuria > 20 micrograms/min). In further analyses, insulin and systolic BP values were divided in quartiles: albuminuria did not differ across insulin quartiles, while it was significantly higher in the top (n = 21) vs the bottom (n = 21) systolic BP quartile. Thus, hyperinsulinaemia and microalbuminuria were unrelated variables in these hypertensive and atherosclerotic patients. Blood pressure, particularly systolic, emerged as a primary predictor of urinary albumin excretion, although the importance of this parameter needs to be proved prospectively.
