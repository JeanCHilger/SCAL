Doppler sonographic enhancement of hepatic hemangiomas and hepatocellular carcinomas after perflenapent emulsion: preliminary study. Ultrasonographic microbubble contrast agents improve Doppler signals by increasing blood backscatter. We retrospectively reviewed our experience with perflenapent (EchoGen), an emulsion of liquid dodecafluoropentane, in the evaluation of 13 patients with focal hepatic lesions (10 hemangiomas and six hepatocellular carcinomas). Perflenapent improved the detection of color Doppler flow signals within the lesions. The hemangiomas showed peripheral nonpulsatile signals and the hepatocellular carcinomas showed more diffuse enhancement with both arterial and venous type signals. This preliminary study suggests that perflenapent administration may aid in the sonographic differentiation of these focal lesions.
