Effect of Ca2+ channel blockers on arterial hypertension and heart ischaemic lesions induced by chronic blockade of nitric oxide in the rat. The effects of the Ca2+ channel blockers diltiazem, nifedipine and amlodipine were investigated on both arterial hypertension and myocardial changes induced by chronic blockade of nitric oxide synthesis. Control male Wistar rats received Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME 20 mg rat(-1) day(-1)) in the drinking water for 8 weeks
