Correlation of hemodynamic and functional variables with the angiographic extent of peripheral arterial occlusive disease. The aim of the study was to determine whether hemodynamic and functional variables are related to the angiographic extent of lower limb atherosclerosis. In 150 patients with stable intermittent claudication, the Bollinger angiogram score was compared with the resting Doppler pressure values, and the initial claudication distance (ICD) and absolute claudication distance (ACD) with treadmill exercise. The extent of lower limb atherosclerosis correlated significantly with the age of the patients and the duration of the claudication. The angiogram scores of the patients were negatively correlated with the ankle systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the ankle/brachial index (ABI). In a multiple regression analysis, ABI was the most predictive variable for the angiographic severity of disease. ICD, ACD and work on the treadmill failed to correlate with the angiogram summation score. If patients were classified into groups for those with iliac or femoropopliteal disease, a weak correlation between ACD and femoropopliteal angiogram score was found. The comparison between Doppler measurements and treadmill exercise testing showed no significant correlation between SBP/ABI of the more diseased limb and ICD. However, both SBP and ABI did correlate significantly with ACD (r = 0.16, p < 0.05 and r = 0.20, p < 0.01, respectively). In conclusion, SBP and ABI are reliable parameters for indirect assessment of the angiographic extent of lower limb atherosclerosis. In contrast, the walking capacity of claudicant patients is independent of the angiographic severity of the disease.
