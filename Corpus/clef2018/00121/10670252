Intimal-medial thickness of the common carotid arteries and lower limbs atherosclerosis in the elderly. In the present study, the authors consider the possible association between intimal-media thickness of the common carotid arteries and lower limb atherosclerosis, in a group of elderly patients the authors also consider the presence of cardiovascular risk factors.B-mode ultrasound measurement of the intimal-media thickness of the common carotid arteries was performed on 80 subjects. Lower limbs atherosclerosis was defined as the presence of intermittens claudicatio and/or ankle-arm index < 0.9. Baseline clinic examination and blood tests were performed in all subjects to consider the presence of cardiovascular risk factors. Linear regression analysis was used to assess the linear relationship between intimal-media thickness of the common carotid arteries and lower limb atherosclerosis.Linear regression analysis showed a statistical association between increased values of intimal-media thickness of the common carotid arteries and lower limb atherosclerosis. Sixty-four (80%) subjects presented one or more associated cardiovascular risk factors.The results of the the present study confirm that intimal-media thickness of the common carotid arteries is a marker for the identification of generalized atherosclerosis and may be useful for the identification of subjects, even at early stages, at risk of cardiovascular diseases.
