Changes in cardiopulmonary parameters during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in patients with heart disease: towards safer endoscopy. Gastrointestinal endoscopy is an invasive examination. The aims of this study were to elucidate the effects and risks of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with regard to cardiopulmonary functions in patients with heart disease, and to establish safety guidelines for use during endoscopy in this particular group of patients.The patients involved were 53 inpatients in whom upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was carried out before cardiac surgery. Their cardiac functions had been evaluated previously. Electrocardiography with two leads (II, V5) was used, and blood pressure and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) were monitored throughout the procedure. The relationship between the changes in cardiopulmonary parameters during endoscopy and the cardiac functions was analyzed.Heart rate increased immediately after insertion of the endoscope (P < 0.01). There was a significantly higher incidence of ventricular and supraventricular extrasystoles during observation of the second portion of the duodenum (P < 0.05). A lower cardiac index (P < 0.05) and a higher New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification (P < 0.05) were found in patients with oxygen desaturation than in patients without it. Two patients with severe coronary artery lesions showed marked ST-T depression, and these ischemic changes were thought to be due to increase in cardiac work during endoscopy.Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy has many adverse effects on cardiopulmonary functions in patients with heart disease. In our study, the clinical value of very close monitoring and administration of oxygen for patients with heart disease was confirmed by objective data.
