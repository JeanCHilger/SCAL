Laparoscopic resection of a proximal splenic artery aneurysm. The usual treatment for splenic artery aneurysm is resection under laparotomy. In recent years, the laparoscopic approach has consisted of ligation without resection. More recently,laparoscopic resection was reported by the Cleveland Clinic. In this paper, we describe the technique used in the laparoscopic resection of our first case of laparoscopic resection of splenic artery aneurysm (SAA). The patient was a young woman with a 12-mm SAA discovered on systematic abdominal ultrasound. The laparoscopic procedure was done successfully, and the aneurysm was resected using an ultrasonic dissector. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on the 3rd postoperative day. Pathological examination revealed the atherosclerotic origin of the aneurysm. The patient is doing well 12 months after surgery, with normal splanchnic Doppler ultrasound. This procedure offers a one-step definitive cure via a minimally invasive surgical procedure.
