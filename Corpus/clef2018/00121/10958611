Blood flow and oxygen consumption with near-infrared spectroscopy and venous occlusion: spatial maps and the effect of time and pressure of inflation. We have measured the local blood flow (BF) and oxygen consumption (OC) in the human calf muscle using near-infrared spectroscopy during venous occlusion. Venous occlusion was achieved by inflating a pneumatic cuff around the thigh of the subject. We have investigated the influence of the inflation time and cuff pressure on the recovered values of BF and OC. We have found that if the cuff pressure is increased from a threshold pressure (approximately 30 mm Hg) to a critical pressure (approximately 45 mm Hg) in less than about 6 s, one measures the same values of BF and OC independent of the total inflation time and final cuff pressure. We also report nine-pixel spatial maps of BF and OC to show that this technique can lead to spatially resolved measurements of blood flow and oxygen consumption in tissues.
