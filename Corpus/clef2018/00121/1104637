An assessment of value of long posterior flaps in below knee amputation by skin blood pressure. The pretibial and calf skin blood pressure was measured in 34 legs, of which 20 suffered from ilio-femoral arterial stenosis and 14 from popliteal arterial stenosis. The constantly higher calf than pretibial pressure in both groups of patients studied strengthens the place of the long posterior flaps in below knee amputation.
