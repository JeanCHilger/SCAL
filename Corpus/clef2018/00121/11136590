Bypass to the genicular arteries for revascularisation of the lower limb. To describe an initial experience with infrainguinal bypass grafts inserted distally in a genicular artery.Retrospective case series study.Eleven patients with Grade III chronic limb ischaemia in whom arteriography showed femoropopliteal occlusive disease and at least one genicular branch suitable for receiving a bypass. Bypass grafts were done to the descending genicular artery (n=4) or the medial sural artery (n=6) using segments of autologous veins one bypass was not completed.Primary graft patency and foot salvage rates were 73% at 1 month and 24 months of follow-up. Patient survival rate was 100% and 90%, respectively. Major amputation was required in two of three patients following early graft failure. Of the eight patients who had a patent graft, the Doppler ankle-brachial systolic pressure index showed no change in one patient, an increase of 0.13-0.66 in six patients, and was not measured in one patient. The former patient underwent a below-knee amputation whereas the other seven patients showed complete healing of their skin ulcers and sites of minor amputation.The genicular bypass is a useful alternative that may extend the limits of infrainguinal arterial reconstruction with autologous tissue and the potential for long-term patient benefit.
