Therapy of iliac artery lesions with a new premounted   balloon-expandable stent ("Flexible Iliac Bridge Stent"). Evaluation of the handling, technical success rate and six month patency rate of a new, premounted balloon-expandable stent in iliac artery lesions.In a prospective study 26 stenoses and 3 occlusions of the iliac arteries were primary treated in 24 patients (Fontaine IIa-III, mean age 60.4 year) with the "Flexible Iliac Bridge Stent" (Medtronic AVE, DÃ¼sseldorf). Five patients had bilateral stenoses. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) in rest and after exercise was determined before the intervention as well as 1-3 days, 1 and 6 months after the Intervention. The handling and visibility of the stent was scored on a three grade scale by the operators. Follow-up angiography including intraarterial pressure measurement was performed in 17 out of 24 patients (21 out of 29 lesions) after 6 months.All 29 lesions were treated with technical success by implantation of 36 stents. The mean degree of the stenoses before intervention was 72.7 +/- 13.8% (+/- 1 standard deviation) and less than 5% in all cases postinterventionally. The mean pressure gradient before and after stent placement was 21 +/- 13.1 mm Hg and 0.8 +/- 2.3 mm Hg, respectively. The Fontaine stage improved by at least one in all patients. The mean ABI at rest improved from 0.63 +/- 0.15 to 0.89 +/- 0.16, and after exercise from 0.46 +/- 0.17 to 0.8 +/- 0.2, respectively. At 6 months 2 lesions out of 21 (9.5%) showed a restenosis of 55% and 70% with an intraarterial pressure gradient of 16 mm Hg and 27 mm Hg, respectively. After 6 months the mean ABI at rest decreased to 0.83 +/- 0.13, and to 0.72 +/- 0.14 after exercise. Handling and visibility was scored as good by all operators.Endoluminal therapy of iliac artery lesions with the used stent is safe and effective. The six month patency rate is comparable to the published data of other stents.
