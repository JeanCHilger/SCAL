Intramuscular administration of estrogen may promote angiogenesis and perfusion in a rabbit model of chronic limb ischemia. Promoting angiogenesis may be an effective treatment for patients with diffuse peripheral vascular disease. This study investigated whether estrogen can promote angiogenesis and perfusion in a rabbit model of chronic limb ischemia.Ischemia was induced in one hindlimb of 24 oophorectomized New Zealand White rabbits. Ten days later (day 0), they were randomized into 4 groups for intramuscular treatment in the ischemic limb: controls receiving saline at day 0 Estrogen-1 group receiving estradiol valerate, modified release (EVMR), 1 mg/kg at day 0Administration of estrogen promotes angiogenesis and perfusion in ischemic rabbit hindlimbs. Thus, estrogen may represent a new therapeutic modality in the management of arterial insufficiency.
