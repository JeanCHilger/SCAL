Asymptomatic leg and carotid atherosclerosis in smokers is related to degree of ventilatory capacity: longitudinal and cross-sectional results from 'Men born in 1914', Sweden. Although smoking is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD), many individuals remain healthy after many years of smoking. The population based cohort 'Men born in 1914' was used to investigate whether the occurrence of non-invasively detected atherosclerosis among smokers is associated with lung function [(i.e. height-adjusted forced expiratory volume during 1 s (FEV1.0) and vital capacity (VC)]. Two hundred and seven smokers without history of CVD were examined with spirometry and calf plethysmography at 55 years, and with spirometry, ankle-arm blood pressure recordings and ultrasound examinations of the carotid arteries at 68 years. Eighty-three men had atherosclerosis defined as carotid stenosis >30% or ankle-arm index <0.9. FEV1.0 and VC were both at 55 years (longitudinally) and at 68 years (cross-sectionally) lower among men with atherosclerosis at 68 years (55 years: FEV1.0, 3.2+/-0.6 vs. 3.4+/-0.5 l P=0.02
