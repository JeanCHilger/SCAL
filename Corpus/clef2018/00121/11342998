Long-term results of percutaneous thrombo-embolectomy in patients with infrainguinal embolic occlusions. The aim of the study was to review early and long term clinical results of percutaneous thrombo-embolectomy in patients with acute embolic occlusions of the infrainguinal arteries.Retrospective analysis of consecutive cases. A total of 88 procedures in 84 patients were performed between 1986 and 1996 in a University Hospital (46 men, 42 women mean age 67.6 +/- 14.4 years). Patients with a history of chronic symptomatic arterial occlusive disease were not included in the analysis. Indications for treatment were severe claudication (n = 45 procedures) and limb threatening ischaemia (n = 43 procedures). Percutaneous thrombo-embolectomy was performed via an ipsilateral approach by means of an end hole aspiration catheter. Local thrombolysis or balloon angioplasty was used as appropriate during the intervention. Follow-up included clinical data, ankle pressure measurements, pulse volume recordings and duplex sonography or angiography if indicated.Technical success was achieved in 85 (96.6%) of the 88 procedures. Two patients (2.3%) suffered major and two patients (2.3%) minor complications. One patient died within 30 days after the procedure. Mean follow-up was 3.7 +/- 2.9 years. Twelve patients (16%) were lost to follow-up. Primary clinical success rate was 88.4% at one and 81.7% at two years and declined to 76.5% at eight years. Out of the 16 interval failures 10 (63%) were due to recurrent embolism to the same leg. They resulted in nine catheter reinterventions and one bypass graft. Six patients were treated conservatively. Cumulative mortality was 11.7% at one year and increased to 29.5% at eight years.From our single centre experience we conclude that catheter treatment of acute embolic occlusion of infrainguinal arteries is safe and has favourable long-term RESULTS. We therefore regard the technique as a less invasive alternative to surgery.
