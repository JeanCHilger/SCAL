Vascular ultrasound surveillance after endovascular intervention for occlusive iliac artery disease. This paper describes vascular ultrasound surveillance after endovascular intervention for occlusive iliac artery disease. There were 105 patients who had 198 procedures in 155 limbs, consisting of 110 balloon dilatations and 88 stentings. The patients were referred to the vascular diagnostic service by several surgeons. All procedures had been considered to be initially technically successful. Colour-Doppler duplex ultrasound studies were performed shortly before and at serial intervals after operation to determine patency rates. Univariate life table analysis showed 69% primary and 96% assisted primary patency at four years. Primary patency rates at four years were significantly worse for stentings (60%) compared to balloon dilatations (71%) (P<0.05). Maximum peak systolic velocities (PSV) were recorded from the treated arteries. Receiver operating characteristics curves showed that PSV >300 cm/s was most accurate for predicting technical failure. Haemodynamic success rates at four years were 72% for PSV >300 cm/s. Results for procedures that were initially successful indicate that long-term primary patency rates for iliac endovascular intervention are acceptable and that assisted primary patency rates are excellent.
