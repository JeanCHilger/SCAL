Cardiovascular reflexes during rest and exercise modified by gravitational stresses. The hypotheses tested were whether variations in central venous pressure via the low pressure baroreceptors would take over or modify the arterial baroreceptor function, and further to which extent local and "whole body" hydrostatic stresses influence blood flow distribution. We investigated total forearm and skin blood flow (venous occlusion plethysmography and 133-Xe clearance) and cardiac output (rebreathing method) among other parameters. Hypo- and hyper-gravitational stresses were simulated by LBNP, LBPP, water immersion and lowering of the arm. The changes in flow distribution in the arm were ascribed to arterial baroreceptor function and not to low pressure baroreceptor activity. The enhancement of venous return during water immersion increased exercise tolerance during heat stress presumably due both to increased stroke volume and decreased venous pooling. The response to sustained handgrip exercise during LBNP and LBPP was not different from control measurements and the effects explained by arterial baroreceptor function. Application of exercise and local hydrostatic stresses in combination with gravitational stresses represent an interesting model for further study of the mechanisms behind the distribution of cardiac output to the peripheral organs.
