Endovascular repair of an innominate artery true aneurysm. To describe endovascular repair of a large aneurysm of the innominate artery in a patient with episodes of transient cerebral ischemia.A 44-year-old man with a history of transient hemiparesis and aphasia demonstrated a large mass in the upper right hemithorax on chest radiography. Systolic brachial pressure in the right arm was 100 mm Hg versus 130 mm Hg in the left. Imaging disclosed a large 12-mm-diameter aneurysm involving the brachiocephalic trunk 1 cm above its origin and the first portion of the right subclavian artery, which was occluded after the dilated segment. The aneurysm was treated with a tapered endograft made from polyester graft attached to a Palmaz stent inserted via a carotid artery arteriotomy. The distal end of the graft was anastomosed to the common carotid artery. Completion angiography showed exclusion of the aneurysm, which has been confirmed by imaging at 21 months. After 2 years, the patient is free from neurological symptoms and has a strong carotid pulse no arm claudication developed.Endovascular correction of innominate artery aneurysms is feasible whenever there is an adequate proximal neck for attachment. In these cases, thoracotomy may be avoided.
