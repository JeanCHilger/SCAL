Vibrational angioplasty in the treatment of chronic femoropopliteal arterial occlusions: preliminary experience. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of vibrational angioplasty in chronic femoropopliteal arterial occlusions.Six patients (5 men ages 52 to 84 years) with peripheral arterial occlusive disease were treated percutaneously using vibrational angioplasty to recanalize the lesion. Three occlusions ranging from 10 to 15 cm long were in the superficial femoral artery (SFA), while 3 other diffusely diseased popliteal arteries were occluded distally (length from 3.5 to 4.5 cm). Vibrational angioplasty using coronary equipment was applied to assist passage of a coronary guidewire, which was followed by conventional angioplasty. Follow-up surveillance featured periodic physical examination, ankle brachial index measurements, and duplex scanning.In all 6 cases, recanalization of the occlusions was successful and without complications. The time to cross the occlusions with the wire ranged from 20 to 25 minutes for the SFA lesions and from 4 to 10 minutes for the popliteal occlusions. Two SFA occlusions were treated with stent implantation. Over a follow-up of 3 to 9 months, all treated vessels were patent. In 3 patients with skin ulcers, healing of the ulcers was observed.Vibrational angioplasty using coronary guidewires seems to be a promising ancillary technique in the management of chronic femoropopliteal arterial occlusions.
