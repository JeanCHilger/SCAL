Effect of the alpha2-agonist dexmedetomidine on cerebral neurotransmitter concentrations during cerebral ischemia in rats. This study investigates whether neuroprotection seen with dexmedetomidine is associated with suppression of peripheral or central sympathetic tone.Thirty fasted male Sprague-Dawley rats were intubated and ventilated with isoflurane and N2O/O2 (fraction of inspired oxygen = 0.33). Catheters were inserted into the right femoral artery and vein and into the right jugular vein. Cerebral blood flow was measured using laser Doppler flowmetry. Bilateral microdialysis probes were placed into the cortex and the dorsal hippocampus. At the end of preparation, the administration of isoflurane was replaced by fentanyl (bolus: 10 microg/kg infusion: 25 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1)). Animals were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: group 1 (n = 10): control animalsDuring ischemia, dexmedetomidine suppressed circulating norepinephrine concentrations by 95% compared with control animals. In contrast, brain norepinephrine and glutamate concentrations were increased irrespective of dexmedetomidine infusion before ischemia.The current data show that the increase of circulating catecholamine concentrations during cerebral ischemia was suppressed with dexmedetomidine. In contrast, dexmedetomidine does not suppress elevation in brain norepinephrine and glutamate concentration associated with cerebral ischemia. This suggests that the neuroprotective effects of dexmedetomidine are not related to inhibition of presynaptic norepinephrine or glutamate release in the brain.
