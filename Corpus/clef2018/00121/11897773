Endothelial nitric oxide synthase lies downstream from angiotensin II-induced angiogenesis in ischemic hindlimb. We assessed the role of angiotensin (Ang) II in ischemia-induced angiogenesis and analyzed the molecular pathways involved in such an effect. Ischemia was produced by unilateral artery femoral occlusion in control, in valsartan-treated (Ang II receptor type I antagonist, 20 mg/kg per day), in Ang II-treated (5 ng/kg per min), and in Ang II and valsartan-treated rats. After 28 days, angiogenesis was assessed by microangiography and capillary density measurement in hindlimbs. The ischemic/nonischemic leg ratio for angiographic score and capillary number increased by 2.6- and 2-fold, respectively, in Ang II-treated rats compared with controls (P<0.01). This was associated with an increase in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF 1.6-fold) and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS
