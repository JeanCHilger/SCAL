The correlation between retinal circulation and function in branch retinal artery occlusion. To investigate retinal circulation and function in eyes with branch retinal artery occlusion(BRAO) using a scanning laser Doppler flow-meter (SLDF) and multifocal electroretinogram (mERG).In juxtapapillary and paramacular areas close to the occluded artery of the affected eye and the corresponding area of the fellow eye, the mean flow measured by SLDF, indicating microcirculation, and the p-wave amplitude in the response of mERG, indicating retinal function, were determined in three patients with BRAO at the period of reperfusion. The ratios of the affected eye to fellow eye(a/f ratio) were calculated, and the ratios of the mean flow (Fa/f) were compared with those of the p-wave amplitude(Pa/f).In the juxtapapillary area, both Fa/f and Pa/f decreased consistently, but in the paramacular area, Pa/f were lower than Fa/f in all cases.Functional recovery is likely to be later in the paramacular area than in the juxtapapillary area in the course of recovery of retinal circulation.
