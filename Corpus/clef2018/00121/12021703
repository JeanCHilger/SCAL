Increasing exercise tolerance of persons limited by claudication pain using polestriding. The efficacy of polestriding exercise (walking with modified ski poles with a movement pattern similar to cross-country skiing) to increase exercise tolerance of persons with intermittent claudication pain caused by peripheral arterial disease was tested in this 24-week prospective randomized clinical trial.The study was conducted in a Department of Veterans Affairs Hospital with 52 individuals who gave written informed consent and were randomized into either a polestriding exercise (n = 27 age, 65.5 +/- 7.0 yearsPolestriding significantly (P <.001) improved exercise tolerance on the constant work-rate and incremental treadmill tests. Ratings of perceived claudication pain were significantly less after the polestriding training program. Subject perceived distance and walking speed scores on the Walking Impairment Questionnaire improved in the polestriding trained group only (P <.001 and.022, respectively).This randomized clinical trial provides empirical evidence that 24 weeks of polestriding training significantly improves quantitative and qualitative measures of the exercise tolerance of persons limited by intermittent claudication pain.
