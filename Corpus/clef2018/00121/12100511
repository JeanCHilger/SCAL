Successful percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for hepatic artery stenosis in an infant undergoing living-related liver transplantation. A 1-yr-old girl underwent a living-related liver transplant, with reconstruction of hepatic artery of 2 mm in diameter under microscopy. She developed intestinal perforation requiring closure on day 4 post-transplant and suffered from hepatic artery stenosis (HAS) on post-transplant day 9. Conservative therapies, such as intravenous or transluminal administration of anti-coagulants, vasodilators or fluids, were unsuccessful and caused remarkable general edema and multiple arrhythmias as a result of increased preload. On day 15 post-transplant, because flow velocity was remarkably reduced (as shown by Doppler ultrasound) the patient underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) using a kit for coronary angioplasty. The balloon catheter was inflated [first: 1.5 mm diameter, 4 atmospheric pressure (a.p.) for 30 seconds (s) second: 2.0 mm diameter, 4 a.p. for 30 s
