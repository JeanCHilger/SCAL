Oxidized low density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) as a marker of atherosclerosis in hemodialysis (HD) patients. To characterize the relationship between oxidative stress and atherosclerosis in HD patients.Seventy-five HD patients were entered into the study. Ox-LDL was measured as a probe for peroxidation and compared to clinical atherosclerotic parameters. Prospective studies were also performed to assess the effects of vitamin E-bonded membrane on oxidative stress.Elderly patients tended to show elevated Ox-LDL (alpha = 0.060+/-0.021 ng/microg LDL protein/year, r = 0.35, p < 0.05). Levels of Ox-LDL in the patients with positive history for atherosclerotic diseases (3.1+/-0.4 ng/microg LDL protein, n = 36) were higher than those with a negative history (1.6+/-0.2, n = 39, p < 0.01). Further-more, ankle/brachial pressure index was negatively correlated to Ox-LDL (alpha = -0.052+/-0.012/ng/microg LDL protein, r = 0.42, p < 0.01). Application of vitamin E-bonded membrane for 10 months (-38+/-11%, n = 14, p < 0.05), but not synthetic membrane, ameliorated Ox-LDL.Our results indicate that Ox-LDL is elevated in aged HD patients. In addition, the present data provide evidence that vitamin E-bonded dialyzers attenuate oxidative stress. Finally, our findings suggest that Ox-LDL correlates to the magnitude of peripheral arterial diseases in HD patients.
