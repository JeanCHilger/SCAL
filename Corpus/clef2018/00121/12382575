Evaluation of the facial artery and vein using color Doppler imaging. The purpose of this study was to provide the guidelines with respect to the location of the facial vessels, observe the potential reversed flow of the facial artery, and reemphasize the value of color Doppler ultrasound studies in flap planning.A study was carried out to investigate the location and dynamics of the facial artery and vein using color Doppler ultrasonography in 12 adults.The facial artery and the vein were located together at the lower border of the mandible. Around the oral commissure and under the nasal ala, they run apart from each other at variable distances. The reverse flow was observed in the 12 patients after the blood flow of the facial artery was blocked by applying pressure manually at the lower border of the mandible.The divergence of the facial vein from the artery is important information in planning of axial pattern flaps. Observation of the reversed flow confirms the possibility of safe elevation of a retrograde flow-arterialized flap based on the distal portion of the facial artery.
