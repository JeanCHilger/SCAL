Long-term results after recanalization of acute and subacute thrombotic occlusions of the infra-aortic arteries and bypass-grafts using a rotational thrombectomy device. Evaluation of the acute and long-term results after recanalization of thrombotic occlusions of infra-aortic native arteries, stented arteries and bypass-grafts using a rotational thrombectomy device (8F Straub-Rotarex TM).From July 2000 to February 2002, in 98 patients (64 % male, mean age 66 +/- 9 (range 47 to 90) years, mean duration of occlusion 31 +/- 33 (range 0 to 140) days, mean occlusion length 21 +/- 11 [range 2 to 40] cm) 100 vessel recanalizations were performed. 42 % of the interventions were performed during the first 14 days after the onset of the symptoms (acute occlusions). These patients were classified according to the after the TASC protocol modified SVS/ISCVS-classification: Class I: n = 22 (52 %) class lla: n = 13 (32 %)Primary success rate was 96 % (ipsilateral interventions 99 %, cross-over 40 %). The restenosis rate after a mean follow-up of 13 +/- 4 months was 33 % for native arteries (group 1), 74 % for instent-recanalizations (group 2) and 86 % for bypass-graft occlusions (group 3). 3 % severe complications occurred: two amputations below the knee after unsuccessful recanalizations of a native artery and a bypass-graft, respectively. One death because of multiorgan failure in patient who was already in cardiac shock before the successful intervention. Further 16 complications could be solved periinterventionally. The ancle-brachial index was significantly improved during follow-up (from 0.37 +/- 0.19 to 0.82 +/- 0.22 before discharge, 0.70 +/- 0.21 after 12 months, p < 0.001).The Straub-Rotarex TM device is useful in the treatment of acute and subacute thrombotic occlusions of infra-aortic arterial and bypass-graft occlusions, with promising long-term results in native vessels but unchanged high restenosis of stented arteries and bypass-grafts.
