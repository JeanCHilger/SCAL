The effects of a low frequency acoustic waveform on peripheral vascular disease: a pilot study. To evaluate the effects of a low frequency acoustic waveform on peripheral vascular disease (PVD).Pilot study utilizing a one-group pre-intervention, post-intervention design.Adults with peripheral vascular disease were recruited through local advertisements. The study was conducted at a local facility housing the electroacoustic transducer.A 25-min exposure to an electroacoustic transducer.Pre- and post-measurement of Doppler ultrasound blood-flow velocities in 10 arteries, ankle brachial index (RBI), foot assessment, and 1-week post telephone survey.A significant increase was noted in the right ankle brachial index (RABI) but not the left. Blood flow increased in all arteries, significantly in four. Thirteen participants reported improvement in symptom of peripheral vascular disease over the following week.While conclusions must be viewed cautiously, the significant differences noted warrant further study to examine effects of acoustic waveforms on peripheral vascular disease.
