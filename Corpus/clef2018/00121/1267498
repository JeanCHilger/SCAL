Postoperative deep vein thrombosis in the lower extremity amputee: A prospective study with Doppler ultrasound. The incidence of postoperative venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism was assessed in 87 patients undergoing 96 major lower extremity amputations for ischemia. Prospective surveillance for deep leg vein thrombosis was carried out by Doppler ultrasound in 35 patients. There was no instance of major leg vein thrombosis and only one episode of a small non-fatal pulmonary embolus in a patient suffering trauma to the amputation stump after discharge from the hospital. This study suggests that clinically significant venous thromboembolism following current techniques of lower extremity amputation is not as common as previously reported. Doppler ultrasound is the most suitable technique for surveillance of venous thrombosis in these patients.
