Early results of stent-grafting to treat diffuse aortoiliac occlusive disease. Diffuse aortoiliac occlusive disease or isolated external iliac artery occlusion >or=10 cm long typically are treated with surgical bypass grafting because of limited durability of stent placement. We evaluated the results of stent-graft placement as an option for treatment of these diseases.Demographic data for patients undergoing stent-grafting in one or more iliac artery segments were recorded. Technical, clinical, and hemodynamic success, and aortoiliac primary and secondary patency were analyzed with Society for Vascular Surgery/American Association for Vascular Surgery criteria.Thirty-four consecutive patients underwent stent-graft treatment because of rest pain (65%) or tissue loss (35%). Mean patient age was 63 years, and 38% of patients were women. Ninety-one percent of patients had hypertension, 71% had coronary artery disease, 21% had renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > 2.0 mg/dL), and 26% had diabetes 71% were active smokers. TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus C or D disease was present in 85% of patients, complete common or external iliac artery occlusion was present in 41%, and external iliac artery disease requiring treatment was present in 94% of patients. Mean lesion length was 13.7 +/- 8 cm. Technical, hemodynamic, and clinical success was achieved in all patients in whom the lesion could be crossed with a wire. Ankle-brachial index increased from.30 +/-.03 to.59 +/-.04. Self-expanding stent grafts were used (Wallgraft, Boston Scientific, Boston, Mass, in 88% of patientsEarly results of stent-graft placement to treat diffuse aortoiliac occlusive disease appear better than our recent experience with stenting alone. Concomitant common femoral endarterectomy or better assessment of femoral disease may improve durability.
