Suprarenal artery stenosis may be mistaken for renal artery stenosis in Doppler studies. There are several limitations in using colour-flow-Doppler (CFD) to diagnose renal artery stenosis. This report describes a case of "false positive" stenosis of the renal artery diagnosed using CFD. A patient affected by arterial hypertension and with a suspected stenosis of the renal artery was examined using CFD. However, the patient was in fact suffering from suprarenal artery stenosis.
