Clinical manifestations and characteristics of vascular bed involvement in atherosclerosis of lower extremities in patients with type 2 diabetes. Clinical manifestations of arterial insufficiency and characteristics of vascular damage were compared in 68 patients (54 men, 14 women, mean age 64.5+/-1.1 years) with atherosclerosis of arteries of lower extremities including 40 patients with type 2 diabetes. Color duplex scanning was used for assessment of severity of vascular wall involvement. Ankle blood pressure was measured by Doppler technique with calculation of ankle-brachial index. Atherosclerosis of arteries of lower extremities in patients with diabetes manifested clinically as neuropathy while intermittent claudication was more characteristic of patients without diabetes. Severity of medial calcinosis and vascular wall rigidity were related to duration of diabetes. Ankle-brachial index in patients with diabetes was 20-30% and 1.5-2 times higher compared with those without diabetes with similar occlusive and nonocclusive changes of arteries of lower extremities, respectively. Color duplex scanning did not reveal differences between patients with and without diabetes in frequency of large multiple atherosclerotic plaques in abdominal aorta, iliac, popliteal arteries.
