Definition of hypertension based on a prevalence study of 1,423 young adults. The prevalence of arterial hypertension (AH) was studied in 1423 individuals (702 males and 721 females) aged 21 years (Fig. 1, Table 1). Systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressures and heart rate (HR) were measured three times on two different occasions separated by at least one week. Three different criteria were used to define AH (Table 3): 1) World Health Organization (WHO) [PAD > or = 95 mmHg in one casual determination] Joint National Committee IV (JNC-4) [PAD > or = 90 mmHg on two different occasions]
