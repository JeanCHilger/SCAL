Assessment of the physiological importance of iliac artery stenosis by laser Doppler flowmetry in pigs. To test the hypothesis that a curve with two peak values (double hump) recorded by laser Doppler flowmetry over the skin of the lower limb during postocclusive hyperaemia reflects pathological vascular resistance in the aortoiliac segment.Open study.Six Norwegian Landrace pigs.Arterial stenoses were induced in the external iliac arteries.Presence of double humped laser Doppler curves, relative decrease in laser Doppler flux between the two peaks, and time taken to reach peak hyperaemic flux.Double humped curves were seen only when arterial stenoses were present. The relative decrease in laser Doppler flux between the two peaks, and the time to reach peak hyperaemic flux were related to the blood pressure gradient (mmHg) at the stenosis (r = 0.88 and 0.83, p less than 0.0001). The laser Doppler curve pattern can be explained by similar dynamic changes in arterial blood pressure distal to the tourniquet during hyperaemia.These results confirm the hypothesis, and suggest that laser Doppler flowmetry recordings of postocclusive hyperaemia may be a non-invasive way of assessing the condition of the iliac artery.
