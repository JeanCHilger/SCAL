Problems associated with the measurement of mean circulatory filling pressure by the atrial balloon technique in anaesthetized rats. To examine the existence of pressure equilibrium between tributary veins and the central vena cava during the mean circulatory filling pressure manoeuvre, pressures in the hepatic portal vein, renal vein, and inferior vena cava were determined at 4-s intervals over a 20-s period of circulatory arrest induced by inflating a right atrial balloon in normal blood volume, 10% volume depletion, and 10% volume expansion states in urethane-anaesthetized rats. Portal vein pressure determined 8 s after arrest during volume depletion and expansion was significantly higher than vena caval pressure (6.2 +/- 0.8 vs. 3.4 +/- 0.2 and 7.7 +/- 0.5 vs. 6.2 +/- 0.4 mmHg (1 mmHg = 133.32 Pa), respectively p less than 0.01)
