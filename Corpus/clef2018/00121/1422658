Doppler ultrasound scanning in the detection of renal artery stenosis in hypertensive patients. The diagnostic accuracy of Doppler ultrasound in the detection of renal arterial disease has been assessed in a prospective study of 61 hypertensive patients. The findings of Doppler ultrasound were compared with the results of renal angiography. In 15 patients (24.5%) no accurate Doppler signs could be obtained and the Doppler ultrasound examination was considered a technical failure. Of the remaining 46 patients, 24 had renal artery stenosis. Nine of the stenoses were not detected by Doppler ultrasound and in three patients a false positive diagnosis of renal artery stenosis was made. The sensitivity of Doppler ultrasound was 62.5%, the specificity 86.4% and the overall diagnostic accuracy was 73.9%. By comparing the 15 patients in whom Doppler ultrasound failed with the 46 in whom it was successful, age appeared to be higher and creatinine clearance lower in the failure group. By comparing the 34 patients with true positive and true negative results with the 12 patients with false results, no significant differences were found. In a multivariate analysis, higher age showed a significant relation to failure of Doppler ultrasound. Doppler ultrasound has limited value in the screening of hypertensive patients for renal artery stenosis.
