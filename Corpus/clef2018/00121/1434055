Two autopsy cases of aortitis syndrome in the elderly. Two autopsy cases of aortitis syndrome (Takayasu's aortitis) in the elderly are presented. Case 1 was an 81-year-old woman in whom hypertension was observed at age 37, and difference of right and left arm blood pressure was pointed out at age 65. She was referred to the authors' hospital at age 72. Chest X-ray and computed tomography of the thorax indicated atypical coarctation and diffuse calcification of the aorta. Case 2 was a 69-year-old woman in whom hypertension was pointed out at age 49, and blood pressure in the arms was found to differ from that in the legs at age 63. Chest X-ray and computed tomography showed diffuse calcification and marked narrowing of the descending aorta. Pathological examination revealed marked calcification in the thickened adventitia of the aorta with mild atherosclerotic change. Irregular fibrotic changes of the adventitia and degeneration of elastic fibers of the media of the aorta were noted in both cases, and were consistent with Takayasu's aortitis. This disorder is common in young women and only a small number of elderly cases are reported although its incidence is increasing. Diffuse calcification of the aorta with an absence of inflammatory signs, which is frequent in older patients, were observed in both case. Systemic hypertension is the most important risk factor with coarctation of the aorta in Takayasu's aortitis. Bypass surgery is recommended in young patients, however in elderly patients, it is generally avoided, in favor of medical control of hypertension.
