Gender differences in perception of PAD: a pilot study. Patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) report profound limitations in all domains of quality of life that are worse than those for patients with chronic pulmonary disease and moderate to severe heart failure. While claudication has detrimental effects on quality of life, little is understood about the factors that influence quality of life and whether these determinants are similar for men and women with PAD and claudication. The purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate the effect of claudication on quality of life in 71 men and 26 women (mean age 72 and 73 years respectively) with PAD. Disease severity as assessed by ankle brachial index (ABI) and community-based walking was similar for men and women, although men reported greater comorbid conditions than women. Despite the similarity in disease severity, women reported decreased physical functioning (p = 0.01), more bodily pain (p = 0.04) and greater mood disturbance (p = 0.012) than men. Claudication and PAD had a greater impact on women than on men and may result from the higher prevalence of mood disturbance and bodily pain reported by women.
