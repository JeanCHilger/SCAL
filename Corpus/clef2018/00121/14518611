Early-onset peripheral arterial occlusive disease: clinical features and determinants of disease severity and location. Early-onset peripheral lower extremity arterial occlusive disease (PAD) is an uncommon, poorly characterized manifestation of atherosclerotic vascular disease. We studied the clinical presentation and correlates of disease severity and location in patients with early-onset PAD identified at non-invasive arterial evaluation. We identified a series of 159 patients who were younger than 50 years and had an abnormal resting or postexercise ankle brachial index (ABI) (< 0.9) or, if arteries were noncompressible, monophasic arterial Doppler signals. Disease severity and location were determined based on results of noninvasive vascular laboratory testing. Presence of coexisting atherosclerosis in other arterial beds was ascertained by review of patient records. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify risk factors associated with disease severity and location. Mean age of the patients was 42.7 +/- 4.2 years and 55% were women. Prevalence of risk factors was 76% for current or past smoking 71%, dyslipidemiaIn this study population of early-onset atherosclerotic PAD, men and women were equally represented. The disease involved predominantly the aortoiliac location. Low HDL-cholesterol and female sex were associated with disease severity. An aggressive approach to diagnosis and treatment may be warranted as atherosclerosis in other arterial beds was prevalent in half of the patients.
