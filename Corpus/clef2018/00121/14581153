Relationship between hyperinsulinemia and pulse wave velocity in moderately hyperglycemic patients. Arterial stiffness assessed by pulse wave velocity (PWV) reflects early stage arteriosclerosis. The influence of hyperinsulinemia on peripheral vascular disease (PVD) is still unknown. We determined the influences of hyperinsulinemia on PVD assessed by PWV in moderately hyperglycemic patients.Thirty-six moderately hyperglycemic, outcoming patients were recruited in this study. All subjects were divided into two groups by fasting immunoreactive insulin (F-IRI) concentrations group AIn group A, both hbPWV and baPWV showed significantly higher values than in group B. ABPIs were not different between two groups. Although age, FPG, plasma HbA1c, serum total-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol concentrations, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure were at same levels in group A as group B, body mass index, HOMA-R, serum triglyceride concentrations were significantly higher in group A, indicating the existence of insulin resistance in group A.Hyperinsulinemia may be involved in the development of PVD in moderately hyperglycemic patients.
