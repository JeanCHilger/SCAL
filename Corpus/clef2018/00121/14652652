High D-dimer levels predict cardiovascular events in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation during oral anticoagulant therapy. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with hemostatic abnormalities and increased risk of thrombotic cardiovascular events even during oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT). The aim of our study was to evaluate the predictive value of hemostatic markers for the risk of major cardiovascular events during OAT. The study group comprised 113 patients with chronic AF (70.2 +/- 5.4 years old, 60% men), referred for OAT. Established clinical risk factors and levels of prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F1+2), thrombin-antithrombin complexes (TAT), D-dimer, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) antigen and activity, before and during OAT (after 3.9 +/- 0.7 months INR 2.57 +/- 0.57) were determined. In all patients OAT significantly suppressed levels of F1+2 by 67%,TAT by 30% and D-dimer by 48% (all p <0.001). During an average follow-up of 44 months 22/111 (20%) patients suffered a combined cardiovascular event (stroke, myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular occlusion or vascular death). Patients with cardiovascular events were significantly older, had more frequent heart failure/systolic dysfunction and had significantly increased levels of D-dimer at entry (63 vs 39 ng/mL, p = 0.005) and during OAT (33 vs 18 ng/mL, p = 0.002), and of t-PA antigen at entry (14.3 vs 10.9 ng/mL, p = 0.02) and during OAT (15.0 vs 11.2 ng/mL, p = 0.05) (all values are medians). In multivariate Cox proportional hazard models, heart failure/systolic dysfunction (hazard ratio 2.91
