Obliteration of portal systemic shunts as therapy for hepatic encephalopathy in patients with non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. The effects of obliteration of portal systemic shunts (PSS) in 5 patients with non-cirrhotic hepatic encephalopathy is reported. All patients had a history of disturbance of consciousness for several years, and examinations revealed large PSS, most of which connecting the left gastric vein to the left renal vein. After the obliteration of PSS, portal vein pressure elevated, the shunt ratio of the portal blood flow decreased, the indocyanine green disappearance rate increased, and serum albumin increased. Blood ammonia (NH3) decreased significantly accompanied by disappearance of hepatic encephalopathy. This treatment may open a way to improve the quality of life in patients with large PSS without severe hepatic injury.
