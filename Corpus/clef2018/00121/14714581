Serum cystatin C level is a marker of end-organ damage in patients with essential hypertension. High urinary albumin excretion rate (AER) has been associated with the presence of atherosclerotic vascular damages and is an independent risk factor for all causes of death and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in essential hypertensive patients. Serum cystatin C (s-CC) is a recently identified nonglycosylated 13-kD basic protein that has been suggested to be a useful marker of glomerular filtration rate. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between s-CC level and end-organ damages in the kidney, heart, and vessels of patients with essential hypertension. Sixty patients with essential hypertension participated in the present study. Patients with renal failure were excluded. Serum-CC level was measured by a particle-enhanced turbidimetric assay. Left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and intima media thickness (IMT) in the common carotid arteries were evaluated by ultrasound images. Twenty-four-hour blood pressure was measured by a cuff-oscillometric method. Serum-CC level was negatively correlated with creatinine clearance (r=-0.617, p<0.0001). It was also correlated with mean 24-h systolic blood pressure (24h-SBP) (r=0.308, p= 0.0167), LVMI (r=0.528, p<0.0001), and IMT (r=0.539, p<0.0001). Both AER and s-CC level were independently associated with mean 24h-SBP. AER but not s-CC level was associated with HDL-cholesterol. The present study was the first to demonstrate that s-CC level is a useful and convenient parameter of renal function, and may also prove to be an early marker of the severity of end-organ damage in patients with essential hypertension.
