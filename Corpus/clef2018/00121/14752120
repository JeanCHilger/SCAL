Comparison of two plethysmography systems in assessment of forearm blood flow. Venous occlusion plethysmography is widely used to assess forearm blood flow (FBF). We compared the established Hokanson system (HEC4) with a newly developed Filtrass 2001 system (F2001). The HEC4 uses mercury-in-Silastic strain gauges, whereas F2001 detects volume changes with a nonmercury linear displacement device. The aim of this study was to evaluate the new F2001 against the HEC4 in terms of repeatability and systematic bias. Ten subjects were studied on 4 separate days in random order using either the HEC4 on both arms, the F2001 on both arms, the HEC4 on the right arm with the F2001 on the left, or the F2001 on the right arm and the HEC4 on the left. Stroop's colored word conflict test and postocclusive hyperemia were used to increase FBF, and lower body negative pressure was used to lower FBF. Stroop's colored word conflict test and lower body negative pressure increased (24.6 +/- 1.5%, n = 240, P < 0.0001) and decreased (18.7 +/- 0.8%, n = 240, P < 0.0001) FBF, respectively. Postocclusive hyperemia after occlusion times of 5, 8, and 13 min substantially increased FBF by 390 +/- 86, 756 +/- 217, and 851 +/- 132%, respectively. Repeatability was not different between the devices (0.10 +/- 2.37 vs. -0.47 +/- 1.92 l/min, n = 125, P > 0.05), and there was no systematic bias. The F2001 is a newly developed plethysmography system that does not utilize mercury and is suitable for assessing changes of FBF in physiological studies.
