Ophthalmodynamometric determination of the central retinal vessel collapse pressure correlated with systemic blood pressure. To evaluate whether determination of the central retinal artery and vein collapse pressure correlate with systemic blood pressure measurements, using a new Goldmann contact lens associated ophthalmodynamometric deviceThe prospective clinical study included 92 eyes of 92 patients presenting with cataract or refractive problems (n = 40 control study group) or with retinal and orbital pathologies (n = 52). With topical anaesthesia, a Goldmann contact lens fitted with a pressure sensor in its holding ring was placed onto the cornea. Pressure was asserted onto the globe by pressing the contact lens, and the pressure value at the time when the central retinal artery and vein started pulsating were noted as central retinal artery and vein collapse pressure. Additionally, the brachial arterial blood pressure was measured.In the control study group, central retinal artery collapse pressure was highly significantly correlated with diastolic blood pressure (correlation coefficient r = 0.77 p<0.001) and systolic blood pressure (r = 0.35Depending on coexisting retinal or orbital diseases, ophthalmodynamometric estimation of the central retinal artery collapse pressure, performed during a routine Goldmann contact lens ophthalmoscopy, correlates with systemic blood pressure measurements.
