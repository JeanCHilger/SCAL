Mild hypothermia enhances the neuroprotective effects of FK506 and expands its therapeutic window following transient focal ischemia in rats. FK506 (tacrolimus), an immunosuppressant, reportedly reduces ischemic brain injury following transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. The authors previously reported that the therapeutic window of FK506 in this model is more than 1 h, but less than 2 h. The aim of the present study is to determine whether mild hypothermia (35 degrees C) enhances the neuroprotective effects of FK506 and expands its therapeutic window. Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 2 h MCAO followed by 24 h reperfusion. Animals were randomly divided into four groups: (I) vehicle-treated normothermic group (II) FK506-treated normothermic group
