Increased soluble E-selectin levels in type 2 diabetic patients with peripheral arterial disease. Abnormal endothelial function is well known in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and thought to induce macroangiopathy. Increased levels of adhesion molecules have been found in type 2 diabetic patients and it has been suggested that they play an important role in the initiation of atherosclerosis. The aim of the present study was to clarify the relationship between objectively proven peripheral arterial disease (pAVD) and serum levels of soluble adhesion molecules in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.Levels of soluble E-selectin, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were evaluated in 18 type 2 diabetic patients with pAVD assessed by Doppler ultrasound, in 19 type 2 diabetic patients and 22 non-diabetic subjects without pAVD.Soluble E-selectin levels were significantly increased in pAVD-diabetic patients compared to diabetics and non-diabetics without pAVD (78.7+/-29 vs 49.7+/-20.4 and 36+/-17 ng/ml respectively, p<0.001), while sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 levels were comparable between the groups. No significant correlation was found between pAVD and adhesion molecule levels. Peripheral AVD was correlated with smoking (p=0.024), duration of diabetes (p=0.048) and microalbuminuria (p=0.041). Regression analysis revealed that only smoking (R=0.536, p=0.012) and glycosylated hemoglobin (R=0.435, p=0.036) were independent factors related to pAVD. Soluble ICAM-1 levels were significantly higher (p=0.041) in diabetic smokers with pAVD and sVCAM-1 (p=0.011) in patients with longer duration of diabetes.Type 2 diabetic patients with pAVD showed increased serum sE-selectin levels. No significant relationship was found between the presence or extent of pAVD and measured adhesion molecules. Our results suggest that sE-selectin reflects endothelial activation and is possibly involved in the atherogenesis process with the contribution of other factors that characterize the metabolic syndrome of diabetes.
