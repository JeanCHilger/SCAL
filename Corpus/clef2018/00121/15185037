Hepatic allograft salvage with early doppler ultrasound diagnosis of acute vena cava thrombosis. Postoperative inferior vena cava obstruction is an uncommon complication after liver transplantation. Outflow obstruction, if not rapidly corrected, can lead to graft failure and the patient's death. We report a case in which Doppler ultrasound showed the thrombus inside the vessel, excluding extrahepatic causes of venous outflow obstruction, and permitted early surgical correction of the complication without graft loss.
