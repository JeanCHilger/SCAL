Predictors of physical function in patients with peripherial arterial disease and claudication. Limitation of walking due to claudication is the hallmark of peripheral arterial disease. The purpose of this secondary analysis was to identify biobehavioral predictors of physical function in peripheral arterial disease patients that included walking ability, gender, age, disease severity, environmental factors (social support), and medical comorbidity (arthritis). All subjects performed an exercise treadmill test to determine initial and absolute claudication distance. The sample consisted of 97 peripheral arterial disease patients, 71 (73%) men and 26 (27%) women, with a mean age of 73+/-8 years (range 52-90 years). Initial claudication distance occurred at 171.88+/-136.35 m. Absolute claudication distance was 421.03+/-286.37 m. A simultaneous multiple regression analysis was performed to determine predictors of physical function. The model accounted for 35% of the variance (p<0.001) and included personal characteristics (age, gender, years of education), severity of disease by ankle-brachial index, environmental factors of social support (marital status), absolute claudication distance, and arthritis. Education (p=0.011), absolute claudication distance (p=0.014), social support (p=0.026), arthritis (p=0.028), and age (p=0.033) were the strongest predictors of physical function. This study identifies biobehavioral factors that place peripheral arterial disease patients at greater risk for reduced physical function and provides a rationale for interventions that improve walking ability.
