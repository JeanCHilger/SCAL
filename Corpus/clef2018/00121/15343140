Subintimal angioplasty of infrapopliteal artery occlusions in the treatment of critical limb ischaemia. Short-term results. To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of subintimal infrapopliteal angioplasty (SIA) as a method for recanalization of occluded tibial arteries in the treatment of critical limb ischaemia (CLI).Between January 2002 and September 2003, 20 patients with CLI were submitted to SIA of these, 16 had diabetes mellitus. All patients had foot ulceration or gangrene and ten had rest pain. All patients were treated with SIA of one or more vessels of the popliteal district. Overall, thirty-four arteries of the infrapopliteal district underwent revascularizationThe technical success rate of SIA in the revascularization of the infrapopliteal vessels was 85%. In the 17 technically successful cases, pain had entirely resolved in 9/10 cases and trophic lesions of the foot healed in 14/17 cases. In this group, 9 patients underwent minor amputation 2 underwent major above-the-ankle amputationSIA is a feasible and effective technique for foot revascularization in patients with CLI. Long occlusions or diffusely calcified arteries are suitable indications. Technical failure does not preclude conventional surgery. In patients treated with SIA, the risk of major amputation is low and mortality rate is nil. Minor complications can be managed using endovascular techniques.
