Relationship between brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity and cardiovascular risk factors of the metabolic syndrome. In this study, we investigated the association between brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), a novel non-invasive means of measuring atherosclerosis, and the cardiovascular risk factors of the metabolic syndrome. The study group comprised of 368 Koreans without history of diabetes or hypertension. Anthropometric parameters, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose (FBG), lipid profiles, ankle-brachial pressure index (ABI), and baPWV were measured in each subject. ABI and baPWV levels were higher in men than in women. ABI and baPWV levels were not correlated with each other. In women, baPWV was closely associated with the cardiovascular risk factors of the metabolic syndrome. Women with the metabolic syndrome showed higher baPWV levels compared to those without the metabolic syndrome (1540 +/- 281 versus 1312 +/- 223, P < 0.001). Multiple regression analysis showed that baPWV was significantly associated with systolic blood pressure, age, sex, waist circumference, and FBG (adjusted R2 = 0.548). The present study shows that baPWV is significantly associated with the features of the metabolic syndrome in Korean women.
