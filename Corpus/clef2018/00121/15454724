Prolonged retraction on the normal common carotid artery induced lethal stroke after cervical spine surgery. Case report.To report a previously undescribed complication of prolonged retraction on the normal common carotid artery after anterior cervical spine surgery.Previous study showed that prolonged retraction could decrease the blood flow of the common carotid artery during anterior cervical spine surgery. A case report revealed that prolonged retraction could induce the formation of thrombosis in the atherosclerotic common carotid artery.Notes review. Computed tomography of the brain was performed on the first and the fourth postoperative day. Carotid Doppler ultrasound and transcranial Doppler ultrasound were performed to evaluate the left common carotid artery and the left intracranial cerebral arteries.After lengthy anterior cervical spinal surgery, the patient did not regain his consciousness during the stay in the postoperative care unit. Large infarction of left cerebral hemisphere was revealed by computed tomography. The patient died on the seventh postoperative day of perioperative lethal stroke.We suggest that prolonged retraction, even on the normal common carotid artery, could induce lethal stroke after anterior cervical spine surgery. We recommend that retractor should be placed carefully and cerebral perfusion should be maintained adequately.
