The treatment of carotid artery bifurcation stenoses with systematic stenting: experience of first 100 consecutive cardiological procedures. Carotid endarterectomy still represents the gold standard treatment of carotid artery bifurcation stenosis but percutaneous angioplasty with stenting is rapidly growing as a non-invasive alternative. In this paper we report the results of systematic application of carotid stenting performed in a cardiological setting, particularly as regards clinical management of patients and technical approach. One-hundred (100) procedures of carotid artery stenting (CAS) on 94 consecutive patients, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, with a carotid stenosis > 70%, were performed over a period of 30 months. The technical approach was directly derived from coronary angioplasty with use of large lumen guiding catheters, 0.014 in. intravascular guidewires and distal protection devices usually employed in coronary interventions. In 3 cases, a post-carotid endarterectomy restenosis and in 97 cases, a de-novo lesion, were treated respectively in 71 cases, the degree of stenosis was 71-89% and in 29 cases, 90-99%. Cerebral protection was obtained with a distal to the lesion endovascular filter in 63 cases. Immediate technical success, i.e. residual stenosis of the treated vessel < 30% and no significant pathologic acceleration of blood flow (< 1.5 m/sec) at the Doppler ultrasound evaluation, was achieved in all procedures (100%). Ninety-six (96) procedures were totally uncomplicated
