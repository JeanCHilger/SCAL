Reproducibility of proximal and distal transcutaneous oxygen pressure measurements during exercise in stage 2 arterial claudication. Although transcutaneous oxygen pressure measurements (tcpO2) are largely used in the investigation of vascular patients, its reproducibility is still debated. Indeed an unpredictable gradient exists between arterial and transcutaneous oxygen pressure. We hypothesised that indices taking into account changes over time and independent of absolute starting values would be more reproducible than other indices.comparative test-retest procedure (1 to 13 days between tests).institutional practice, ambulatory care.15 subjects with stage 2 claudication.tcpO2 recordings at rest and at exercise during the 2 treadmill tests.calculation of the Delta-from-rest of oxygen pressure index (limb tcpO2 changes minus chest tcpO2 changes), of the resting - or minimal values attained during exercise - of absolute tcpO2 and of the regional perfusion index (regional perfusion index: ration of limb to chest).Both absolute tcpO2 and regional perfusion index at rest showed low reproducibility. During exercise the best reproducibility was attained through Delta-from-rest of oxygen pressure index calculation. Equations from the linear regression analysis (test 2 versus test 1) were 0.88 x -4.2 (r(2)=0.82) at the buttock level and 0.82 x -3.8 (r(2)=0.80) at the calf level.TcpO2 measurement on the calf or buttock during exercise, is a reproducible measurement in patients with vascular claudication, specifically when corrected for exercise-induced systemic pO2 changes trough Delta-from-rest of oxygen pressure calculation.
