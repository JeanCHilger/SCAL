Ankle brachial pressure index and carotid intima-media thickness as atherosclerosis markers in Japanese diabetics. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical significance of ankle brachial pressure index (ABI) and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes. ABI and ultrasonographic carotid IMT measurements were made in 1311 patients and the relationships between ABI, IMT, and cardiovascular diseases were examined. Patients were assigned to one of three groups depending on their ABI index: (i) ABI > or = 1.0 (ii) ABI from > or = 0.9 to < 1.0
