Relationships between brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity and conventional atherosclerotic risk factors in community-dwelling people. A simple instrument has been developed to measure brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV). The aim of the present study was to use this instrument to study the relationship between baPWV and conventional atherosclerotic risk factors.Community-dwelling Japanese (632) living in a rural area (234 men and 398 women) participated in a municipal medical health survey that included baPWV measurement and a traditional clinical examination, conducted in June, 2002.Men had a significantly higher baPWV than women. No interaction between gender and age on baPWV was identified. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that age, hemodynamic factors (diastolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, and heart rate), hemoglobinA1c, current drinking and smoking status, and mild retinal changes had significant independent influences on higher baPWV.In this rural population, age, gender, and hemodynamic factors were independently associated with baPWV, along with traditional atherosclerotic risk factors, although no significant associations between baPWV and histories of atherosclerotic diseases or subclinical atherosclerosis except for mild retinal changes were demonstrated.
