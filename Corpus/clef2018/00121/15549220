Significance of Doppler ultrasound procedures for diagnosis of carotid stenoses. Determining degree and morphology of stenoses is important for surgical planning or stent implantation. Vascular ultrasound is usually the first modality to evaluate carotid artery stenosis. Due to rapid development various methods of vascular ultrasound are applied including continuous wave (CW) Doppler, duplex Doppler, colour-coded duplex sonography (CCDS), power Doppler and B-flow technique. For quantitative assessment of the degree of stenosis the most frequently used parameters are peak systolic velocity (PSV), end-diastolic velocity (EDV) in the internal carotid artery (ICA), as well as ICA to CCA ratios of PSV and EDV. Different results reported in the literature may reflect differences in defining the degree of stenosis and methodological differences in protocol or imaging techniques. Differences in defining the degree of stenosis, advantages and disadvantages of the different Doppler techniques and future developments are discussed in detail.
