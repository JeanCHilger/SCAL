High prevalence of peripheral arterial disease and low treatment rates in elderly primary care patients with diabetes. Representative data on peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in community-based office practice are scarce while at the same time of high interest. Thus, we aimed to determine the prevalence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD), comorbidity of atherothrombotic manifestations, and treatment intensity among elderly diabetic patients in primary care. In this monitored cross-sectional study, 344 general practitioners throughout Germany determined the ankle-brachial index (ABI) of 6880 consecutive, unselected patients aged 65 years or older with bilateral Doppler ultrasound measurements. PAD was defined according to the recent American Heart Association guidelines (using the higher of the 2 systolic ankle pressures: ABI < 0.9) or peripheral revascularisation, or amputation because of PAD. Coronary events (CAD) and cerebrovascular events (CVD) were taken from the patient's history without additional diagnostic measures. Diabetes was defined according to the clinical diagnosis of the physician and/or HbA1c > or = 6.5 % and/or intake of oral antidiabetic medication and/or application of insulin. 1.743 patients were classified as diabetics: the median disease duration was 6 years (1st 3rd quartile: 2
