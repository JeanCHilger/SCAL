Midterm results after atherectomy-assisted angioplasty of below-knee arteries with use of the Silverhawk device. Prospective evaluation of the 3- and 6-month results after atherectomy of below-knee arterial lesions with a reference diameter of at least 2.0 mm with use of the Silverhawk device.Fifty-two below-knee lesions in 33 patients (61% men mean age, 70 years +/- 11) with chronic peripheral occlusive disease of the lower limbs were treated with directional atherectomy. Target lesions were the popliteal artery (segment 3), n = 4 (8%)All but one lesion (2%) could be treated with the atherectomy catheter. After additional balloon angioplasty, all but one lesion was treated, with a residual stenosis no greater than 30% (98%), with 7.2 passes per lesion +/- 2.8 (range, 1-12) performed with the device. Fifteen lesions (29%) were treated after predilation and 37 (71%) were treated with primary atherectomy. In 15 lesions (29%), additional balloon angioplasty was performed, and two lesions required stent implantation as a result of dissection. The mean stenosis diameter after atherectomy was 12% +/- 18% (range, 0-100%). After additional therapy, the mean stenosis diameter was 6% +/- 9% (range, 0%-30%). A residual stenosis no greater than 30% was achieved in 50 lesions (96%). The mean ankle-brachial index significantly increased from 0.46 +/- 0.27 to 0.80 +/- 0.34 before discharge and remained improved during follow-up. One procedural complication (3%) was observed in which an intermittent occlusion of the target vessel occurred after an unsuccessful attempt to cross the lesion with the atherectomy device this was then treated successfully with local lysis. One patient with one treated lesion died during follow-up. The rates of restenosis of at least 70% (diagnosed by duplex ultrasonography) were 14% (seven of 51 lesions) after 3 months and 22% (11 of 51) after 6 months. The 3-month and 6-month cumulative event-free survival were 91% +/- 4.1% and 76.9% +/- 5.8% and the 3-month and 6-month cumulative patency rates were 98% +/- 1.9% and 94.1% +/- 3.3%, respectively.Below-knee native vessel lesions with a diameter of at least 2.0 mm can be treated with the Silverhawk catheter with a high success rate and a low complication rate. Midterm technical and clinical results are encouraging. Additional balloon angioplasty might be necessary in selected cases.
