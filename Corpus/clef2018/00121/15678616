Utility and barriers to performance of the ankle-brachial index in primary care practice. Peripheral arterial disease is prevalent, associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and is underdiagnosed. Nevertheless, systematic efforts to provide early office-based peripheral arterial disease detection are not routinely implemented in office practice. The PARTNERS Program implemented the ankle-brachial index (ABI) measurement in primary care outpatient clinics in order to model practical dissemination of this technique and thus improve office-based peripheral arterial disease detection. The objective of this study was to identify clinician-defined factors that were perceived to foster acceptance of, or create barriers to, the use of the ABI in office practice. The ABI Utilization Survey was administered to primary care clinicians who participated in the PARTNERS Program, as well as to additional primary care clinicians who participated in the PARTNERS Preceptorship. The survey assessed six parameters: pre- and post-participation office ABI utilization perceived clinical utility of the ABI
