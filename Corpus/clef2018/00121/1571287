Compartment syndrome. Compartment syndrome results from increased pressure in the closed compartments of the lower or upper extremities. Although it is not a common occurrence, it should be considered a possible complication whenever a patient experiences acute arterial occlusion or revascularization. If left untreated, compartment syndrome can lead to the loss of neuromuscular function, contractures, myoglobinuric renal failure, and amputation. Nurses play an integral role in the detection and treatment of compartment syndrome. Treatment is aimed at minimizing tissue damage and loss of function.
