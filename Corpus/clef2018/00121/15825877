Noninvasive detection of coronary artery disease by arterio-oscillo-graphy. Coronary artery disease (CAD) causes oscillations in peripheral arteries. Oscillations of the walls of the brachial arteries of 51 patients were recorded [together with the electrocardiogram (ECG)] by an accelerometer at different cuff pressures. By analyzing the energy of the oscillations in the 30-250 Hz band, 16 of 22 patients with CAD and 26 of 29 non-CAD subjects were classified correctly, independent of the ECG, and with no effect of heart murmurs.
