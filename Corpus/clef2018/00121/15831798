Effects of a 6-mo endurance-training program on venous compliance and maximal lower body negative pressure in older men and women. Aging and chronic exercise training influence leg venous compliance. Venous compliance affects responses to an orthostatic stress. The extent to which exercise training in a previously sedentary older population will affect venous compliance and tolerance to the simulated orthostatic stress of maximal lower body negative pressure (LBNP) is unknown. The purpose of this investigation is to determine the influence of a 6-mo endurance-training program on calf venous compliance and responses and tolerance to maximal LBNP in older men and women. Twenty participants (exercise group: n = 10, 5 men, 5 women control group: n = 10, 6 men, 4 women
