Non-invasive Doppler ultrasound technique for the in vivo assessment of aortic compliance. A non-invasive Doppler ultrasound technique for the assessment of aortic compliance is described. This is based on the in vivo measurement of pulse wave velocity along the thoraco-abdominal aortic pathway. A structured protocol has been developed to improve the reproducibility of the technique as well as for the purposes of operator training. Preliminary results of a study of both the intra- and inter-observer variability of the method are provided and problems associated with the technique are discussed. Medical disorders such as atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus and familial hypercholesterolaemia have all been shown to affect arterial wall compliance. We suggest that the measurement of aortic compliance in vivo may be a useful, non-invasive tool for assessing these patients' susceptibility to atheromatous arterial disease and for monitoring their response to therapy.
