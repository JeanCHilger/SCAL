Significance of laser dopplerometry in diagnostics of upper extremity occupational angiopathy. The paper demonstrates the results of the application of laser dopplerometry supplemented with respiratory, thermal and occlusive functional tests, as a new non-invasive method of microcirculation evaluation. Initially the majority of patients have spastic or hyperemic microcirculation disturbances in the skin of the fingers. Functional tests allow specification of the mechanisms of these disturbances, such as microhemodynamic inertness and the suppression of slow circulatory rhythms, which demonstrate the presence of myogenic tonus disorder and prove that vibration has direct influence on vascular wall cells. The manifestation of neurogenic component is the dominance of sympatic vasomotor reflex. The paper also demonstrates the dominance of vasoconstrictor effect over vasodilatatory one.
