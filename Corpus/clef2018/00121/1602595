Echo/Doppler diagnosis of tetralogy of Fallot, ventricular septal defect, pulmonary valve dysplasia, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in WKY/NCrj rats. We examined the hearts of 97 WKY/NCrj rats, a strain which spontaneously develops congenital cardiac malformations, by means of echocardiography with a pulsed Doppler ultrasound, and compared the results with those of 20 WKY/Ta rats and 30 normal Wistar rats. Dissection of these WKY/NCrj rats revealed a ventricular septal defect (VSD) in 20 and pulmonary valve dysplasia (PVD) in 41, both VSD and PVD occurring together in 18. VSD was readily diagnosed in vivo by the jet flow signal derived from the left-to-right shunt near the membranous portion, with a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 99%. Ultrasound imaging revealed overriding of the aorta and right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy in 18 of the 20 rats with VSD. Of the 20 rats with VSD, 10 had a systolic high-velocity jet across the RV outflow indicating an infundibular stenosis. PVD was commonly accompanied by a pulmonary regurgitation signal, with severe cases showing intensified echo and low excursion of the cusps. The regurgitation signal showed a good diagnostic value for PVD with a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 85%. In the remaining 54 WKY/NCrj rats without VSD or PVD, the ratio of mean left ventricular (LV) wall thickness to cavity dimension, the fractional shortening of the LV dimension, and the septal to LV free wall thickness ratio were all abnormally high, and the motion of the ventricular septum was reduced in most of the cases compared with that of the other two strains. All these features resemble the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy seen in humans, which further promises that the rats should be a useful model for the controversial disease.
