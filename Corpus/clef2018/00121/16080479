Ultrasound contrast media in the study of salivary gland tumors. The aims of the present study were: to assess standard ultrasound and color-Doppler patterns for the study and characterization of salivary gland tumors to define the improvement in the color-Doppler ultrasound image after injection of a signal amplifier (Levovist)We used color-Doppler ultrasound before and after injection of the contrast medium to study 56 patients (32 males and 24 females) between the ages of 28 and 77 years old, presenting nodular pathology of the salivary glands. Only patients with less than optimal results of the basic color-Doppler examination (grade of vascularization 0-1) were included in the study. The data were then compared with the final histological results.According to B-mode ultrasonography, all neoplasms were hypoechogenous 8 showed irregular margins and, of these, 6 were carcinomas. We did not obtain significant data regarding size and echostructure. In 10 cases, we observed the presence of multiple locoregional formations in the lymph nodes. Patients were selected on the basis of unsatisfactory color-Doppler examination resultsWe observed that the contrast medium was useful in characterizing lesions, of the salivary glands by allowing for a more precise vascular map of the lesions, as well as greater diagnostic accuracy in tracing the vascular blood flow and calculating quantitative and semiquantitative data.
