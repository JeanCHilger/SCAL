Autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cell implantation for patients with peripheral arterial disease improves limb ischemia. Implantation of bone marrow mononuclear cells, including endothelial progenitor cells, into ischemic limbs has been shown to improve collateral vessel formation. In the present study the safety and feasibility of autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) implantation after granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)-induced mobilization was investigated in patients with severe peripheral arterial disease.Six cases were enrolled: 5 of thromboangitis obliterans and 1 of arteriosclerosis obliterans. Following administration of G-CSF (10 microg . kg(-1) . day(-1)), PBMNCs were harvested and injected intramuscularly (5 legs and 1 arm) for 2 days for the patients with ischemia of the legs. No serious adverse events related to G-CSF administration, harvest or implantation were observed during this study period. Improvement in the ankle - brachial pressure index (ABI: >0.1) was seen in 4 patients at 4 weeks and ischemic ulcers improved in 3 of 3 patients. The mean maximum walking distance significantly increased from 203 m to 559 m (p=0.031) at 4 weeks and was sustained for 24 weeks. Significant improvement was seen in physiological functioning subscale of Short Form-36.Implantation of PBMNCs collected after G-CSF administration could be an alternative to therapeutic angioplasty in patients with severe peripheral arterial disease.
