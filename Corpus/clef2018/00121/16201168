Endovascular treatment for peripheral arterial stenosis with endoluminal stent. To initially evaluate the effect and security of endovascular treatment for arterial stenosis with endoluminal stent.Thirty-four cases of arterial stenosis were treated with endoluminal stent from March 1999 to May 2001. The stenosis involved descending aorta (1 case), iliac artery (2), femoral artery (2), carotid artery (1), subclavian artery (2) and renal artery (1). Thiry-three cases had arteriosclerosis and one Takayasu's arteritis. Twenty-six cases were percutaneously punctured and eight cases were punctured directly.All the 34 cases had the stents successfully implanted. However, one case of descending aorta stenosis died on the operation day due to rupture of the descending aorta. Dissection was performed in thirteen cases after balloon dilation and hematoma was seen at the puncturing point in eleven cases. TIA (transient ischemia attack) and cerebral infarction did not occur in the case of carotid arterial stenosis. For those with stenosis in lower extremities, ABI (ankle-brachial index) increased from 0.45 to 0.72 postoperatively. The brachial pressure of two cases of subclavian arterial stenosis returned to normal postoperatively. The blood pressure of case of renal arterial stenosis reduced from 180/120 mm Hg to 140/90 mm Hg. All the cases were followed up for one month to 26 months. Thrombosis of the arteries treated occurred in two cases of iliac arterial stenosis four and six months postoperatively.The effect of endovascular treatment for arterial stenosis with endoluminal stent is satisfactory. Endovascular therapy is especially suitable for iliac arterial and limited stenosis of the subclavian artery. However, it should be cautiously used in the stenosis of the carotid artery.
