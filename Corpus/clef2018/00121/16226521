Intravitreal triamcinolone compared with macular laser grid photocoagulation for the treatment of cystoid macular edema. To evaluate the outcome of cystoid macular edema (CME) treated with intravitreal injections of triamcinolone acetonide (TA), macular laser grid photocoagulation (MLG), or both (TA+MLG).Prospective, randomized, interventional, parallel, three-arm clinical trial.Institutional clinical study.Fifty-six patients (63 eyes) affected by diabetic or retinal vein occlusion CME.Twenty-two eyes received intravitreal injections of 4 mg TA 21 eyes underwent MLGBest-corrected visual acuity (VA), central macular thickness (CMT) (by optical coherence tomography), and postoperative complications.Mean follow-up was 9 +/- 2 months (range 6 to 12 months). Baseline VA (logarithm of minimal angle of resolution [logMAR]) and CMT were, respectively, 0.82 +/- 0.19 and 556 +/- 139 microm microns for the TA group, 0.84 +/- 0.15 and 601 +/- 102 microm microns for the MLG group, and 0.83 +/- 0.22 and 573 +/- 106 microm microns for the TA+MLG group (no statistically significant difference among the groups). After the treatment, at 45 days, 3, 6, and 9 months in the TA group, VA had improved (P = .004) by 0.26, 0.25, 0.22, and 0.23 logMAR and CMT had decreased by 37%, 33%, 29%, and 31% (P = < .001). In the MLG group, VA was unchanged although CMT had decreased by 5%, 13%, 14%, and 16% (P = .021). In the TA+MLG group, VA had improved (P = .003) by 0.26, 0.24, 0.19, and 0.20 logMAR, and CMT had decreased by 36%, 34%, 28%, and 29% (P = < .001). The groups receiving triamcinolone had better VA and lower CMT values at all time points (P < .05). A reinjection was performed in eight eyes intraocular pressure increased in nine eyes (treated with medical therapy), and cataract progressed in one eye. No injection-related complications occurred.TA intravitreal injection improves VA and reduces CMT more than MLG, which in triamcinolone-treated eyes does not offer further advantages. Intravitreal TA injection could be used as primary treatment in patients with CME.
