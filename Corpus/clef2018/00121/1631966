Excimer laser-assisted balloon angioplasty of the femoro-popliteal segment. In the Department of Vascular Surgery RK, The University Hospital in Copenhagen, the authors have treated 16 patients with ischaemia in the lower limb by means of laser-assisted balloon angioplasty. A pulsed ultraviolet excimer-laser was employed. It proved possible to break down the occluding arterial lesion in 12 patients (75%). In one patient, this was not followed-up by balloon angioplasty and, in another patient, the reconstruction closed on the first day after operation. The primary success of the procedure, defined as breaking down of the occlusion with the laser-catheter followed by balloon angioplasty and an increase in the ankle/brachial index of greater than 15%, was found to be 10/16 or 62%. The remaining four patients, in whom it did not prove possible to break down the arterial lesion with laser, were treated by means of conventional vascular surgical reconstruction. On follow-up examination after an average of nine months, nine out of the ten patients (90%) still had a patent reconstruction after laser-assisted balloon angioplasty. This new endovascular laser-procedure appears to be suitable for selected patients, but must be assessed more meticulously before it is possible to determine its future placing in the vascular surgical therapeutic armamentarium.
