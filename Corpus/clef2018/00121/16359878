Near-infrared spectroscopy in the routine diagnostic work-up of patients with leg ischaemia. To examine the reproducibility and clinical applicability of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in patients with leg ischaemia.Prospective comparative diagnostic study.Routinely measured peripheral blood pressure and microcirculatory parameters were compared with tissue oxygen saturation (TsO(2)) measurements using a new NIRS device on the calf muscle and the foot. Healthy subjects (n=20) and patients in different stages of leg ischaemia (n=45) were investigated at rest and after provocation: a treadmill test, arterial occlusion and a change in posture. Healthy volunteers were used as an age-matched reference population.Reproducibility of the NIRS was excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient at rest was 0.91 (95% confidence interval: 80-99). Resting TsO(2) (65%) in healthy controls did not differ significantly from that in patients (Fontaine 2: 66% F3/4: 68%). After exercise, a significant reduction in TsO(2) was observed only in patients: Fontaine 1: 60%NIRS is a very reproducible tool to assess tissue oxygen saturation, but is not useful for the routine work-up of patients with leg ischaemia.
