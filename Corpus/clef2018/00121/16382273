Risk factors for poor collateral development in claudication. The objective of this retrospective, cross-sectional study was to determine risk factors for poor collateral development in patients with claudication. The authors listed all patients with calf claudication who had undergone angiography in this hospital between 1999 and 2001 and extracted those with superficial femoral artery (SFA) occlusion, a popliteal artery without major lesions, and at least 1 patent calf artery. Forty-five patients met the criteria, and concomitant disease and claudication characteristics, ankle/brachial index (ABI) and number of outflow vessels were recorded. Three blinded observers calculated the number of collaterals on the angiograms, and the collateral count was related to the other factors by use of regression analysis. The mean patient age was 69 years (SD 11), and 62% were women. Their walking distance was 90 m (77) and ABI 0.47 (0.15). Thirty-three percent had diabetes and 50% had duration of symptoms longer than 5 years. The mean number of collaterals bypassing the occlusion was 15.1 (SD 4.8). Univariate regression analysis indicated an association (p <0.08) between few collateral vessels and diabetes, short duration of symptoms, current smoking habits, and old age. In the multivariate analysis only diabetes and short duration of symptoms were related to having few collaterals. In patients with claudication and SFA occlusion, few collaterals from the deep femoral artery appear to be associated with having diabetes and a short duration of symptoms.
