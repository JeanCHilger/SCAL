Diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency. While the importance of clinical criteria for the diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency remains unchallenged, the equipment-based diagnosis has developed away from pressure measurement, plethysmography and phlebography towards Doppler and color-flow duplex scanning. The CEAP classification of clinical stages is recognized throughout the world. Skin tests, the evaluation of ankle joint mobility and the investigation of the thrombophilia risk continue to be required.
