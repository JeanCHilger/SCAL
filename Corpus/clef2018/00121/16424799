Exogenous basic fibroblast growth factor increases collateral blood flow in female rats with femoral artery occlusion. The goal of this study was to determine if extended duration of FGF-2 infusion would further expand collateral blood flow (BF) in female rats with bilateral femoral artery occlusion rats were infused with either FGF-2 or placebo intra-arterially for 14, 28, and 42 days. Blood flows were measured with isotope labeled microspheres. Blood pressure and heart rate were similar between the treatment groups by ANOVA. In Placebo groups
