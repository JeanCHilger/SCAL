Soluble Fas, a mediator of apoptosis, C-reactive protein, and coronary and extracoronary atherosclerosis. The Rotterdam Coronary Calcification Study. Findings from laboratory studies strongly suggest a role for apoptosis, the process of programmed cell death, in cardiovascular disease. No population-based study has yet investigated whether serum levels of soluble forms of Fas, a receptor capable of inducing the apoptosis cascade, are associated with coronary and extracoronary atherosclerosis.Within the Rotterdam Coronary Calcification Study, a population-based cohort study, we measured coronary calcification using electron-beam computed tomography, abdominal aortic calcification by abdominal X-ray, carotid plaques and common carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) by ultrasonography, and lower extremity atherosclerosis by computation of the ankle-arm index. Levels of sFas and of the inflammatory mediator C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured in 1036 participants.Levels of sFas were not related to coronary or extracoronary atherosclerosis. CRP showed strong associations with measures of atherosclerosis, including coronary atherosclerosis, which largely remained after adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors.The results of this study do not support a role for sFas in the identification of subjects with atherosclerosis.
