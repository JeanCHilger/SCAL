Subintimal angioplasty of long femoropopliteal artery occlusions. Subintimal angioplasty is a newer method in the treatment of lower extremity atherosclersosis. This paper reports the results of our first experiences with long (>10 cm) femoropopliteal artery occlusions.In the period from July 1999 to July 2003, 28 patients were treated with subintimal angioplasty. The indication was intermittent claudication or critical ischaemia. The patients were followed clinically to evaluate the patency. The results are reported retrospectively.The technical success rate was 25/28 (89%). Patients with intermittent claudication experienced relief of symptoms after the intervention, and their median ankle-brachial index increased significantly. The primary patency rate for patients with intermittent claudication treated successfully was 53% after one year. Critical ischaemia was associated with a lower patency rate.Subintimal angioplasty can be used in the treatment of long (>10 cm) femoropopliteal artery occlusions with a high technical success rate. Our patency rates are comparable with those recorded in the literature but are still lower than those after distal bypass surgery. Thus, subintimal angioplasty may be used in treatment of patients for whom open vascular surgery is impossible or as a bridge to open vascular surgery in young patients with severe intermittent claudication.
