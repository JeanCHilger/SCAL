Flow-dependent stimulation of sodium and cholesterol uptake and cell growth in cultured vascular smooth muscle. A10 vascular smooth muscle cells were placed in a flow chamber and exposed to the circulation of foetal calf serum at different rates and pressures. Under unidirectional laminar flow, physiological flow rates and pressures had almost no effect on internal sodium content. Indeed, pressure values greater than 150 mmHg were required to observe modest increases in sodium content. Conversely, a short exposure to turbulent flow (3 min) induced a strong increase in cell sodium content. At flow rates found in large human arteries, the onset of such ionic change required pressure levels of 50-85 mmHg. The restoration of laminar flow allowed the elimination of the excess cell sodium content, with a half-life of 3-4 h. Opening of calcium channels by the turbulent flow was suggested by the following observations: (1) nitrendipine fully prevented sodium uptake, with an inhibitory concentration of 50% of approximately 2 x 10(-7) mol/l and (2) exposure to turbulent flow increased cytosolic free calcium content by approximately 80%. In addition to sodium uptake, turbulent flow stimulated cell uptake of exogenous cholesterol. Although the restoration of laminar flow allowed the rapid elimination of approximately two-thirds of the excess in cell cholesterol (with a half-life of 30-60 min), one-third of the excess cholesterol remained in the cells for more than 24 h. Finally, cell replication was faster in cells exposed to turbulent flow than in control cells subjected to laminar flow. The results show that turbulent flow provokes membrane ion transport changes in vascular smooth muscle cells, which are associated with enhanced cholesterol uptake and cell hyperplasia. Therefore, the departure from unidirectional laminar flow may be a pathogenic factor in primary hypertension and/or atherosclerosis.
