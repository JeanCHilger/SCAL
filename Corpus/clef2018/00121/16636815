Characteristics of brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity in Japanese children. Measurement of pulse wave velocity (PWV) is a useful approach for evaluating the severity of atherosclerosis in adults, and, in particular, the measurement of brachial-ankle PWV (baPWV) has been commonly reported as a simple and practicable method. We attempted to investigate how baPWV in healthy children changes with age and gender, in order to assess baPWV in children with risk factors for the early progression of systemic atherosclerosis.We measured baPWV in 970 healthy Japanese children (500 boys and 470 girls), and set up the normal baPWV values of children on the basis of age and gender. We also performed linear regression analysis and step-wise multiple regression analysis for evaluating its correlation with baPWV and independent variables for baPWV in children.The values of baPWV in children were higher in boys than in girls, and baPWV increased with age in both genders. Age, blood pressure and heart rate (HR) were significant determinants of baPWV in both male and female subjects, while the obesity index had no correlation with baPWV.On the basis of these results, we suggest that baPWV in children is largely influenced by age and gender, and that baPWV gradually increased with age in both genders.
