Ankle-arm index is a useful test for clinical practice in outpatients with suspected coronary artery disease. Although a low ankle-arm index (AAI) has been reported to be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular mortality in several populations, no data exist concerning the impact of AAI for outpatients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) in the clinical setting.The present study enrolled 840 outpatients (age range 35-87 years, mean age 63.9+/-10.2) with suspected CAD. All patients underwent AAI measurements and coronary angiography, and based on the AAI values, they were divided into group A (AAI <0.9 n=191The AAI test is an effective tool in predicting CAD in outpatients in clinical practise.
