Upper-thoracic sympathectomy in the treatment of upper limb ischemia at distal form of arterial lesion. Efficacy of upper-thoracic sympathectomies performed in 61 patients with chronic upper limb ischemia is analyzed. Thoracotomy was used in 20 cases, videothoracoscopic approach -- in 56 (including 15 cases of two-sided procedures). Efficacy was evaluated with clinical examination, rheovasography, laser Doppler-flowmetry, percutaneous detection of tissue oxygen tension. Advantages of videothoracoscopy compared with thoracotomy are demonstrated.
