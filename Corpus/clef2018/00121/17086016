Arterial elasticity and erectile dysfunction in hypertensive men. Erectile dysfunction is a common symptom among hypertensive patients that impairs quality of life and adherence to antihypertensive pharmacologic therapy. It is also associated with cardiovascular risk factors and disease. The Sexual Health Inventory in Men (SHIM) was administered to 105 ambulatory hypertensive patients, and large and small artery elasticity indices were measured. Each variable was examined in a simple linear regression model or 1-way analysis of variance model to determine each variable's relationship with the SHIM score. Variables that were significantly associated with the SHIM score in the univariate models included age, duration of hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and small artery elasticity. Large artery elasticity was not significantly associated with the SHIM score. In the multivariate model, age, hypertension duration, and peripheral vascular disease were associated with a lower SHIM score. This study demonstrates a relationship between erectile dysfunction and reduced artery elasticity.
