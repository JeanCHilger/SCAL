Angiotensin receptor blockade improves vascular compliance in healthy normotensive elderly individuals: results from a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may play a role in vascular aging. The authors hypothesized that blockade of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor with an angiotensin receptor blocker in healthy elderly subjects improves vascular compliance and endothelial function. Thirty-five healthy elderly subjects were randomized to valsartan or placebo in a double-blind crossover study after baseline testing for pulse wave velocity, aortic augmentation index, and brachial artery flow-mediated dilation. Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade with valsartan improved vascular compliance but not flow-mediated dilation. Changes in pulse wave velocity with valsartan were correlated with change in central systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure and remained associated on multivariate analysis. Change in pulse wave velocity after adjusting for degree of blood pressure change, age, and sex remained correlated with assignment to the angiotensin receptor blocker but not placebo. These data suggest that angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade improves aging-related vascular compliance without alterations in flow-mediated dilation. Mechanisms regulating compliance and endothelial function are complex and may not necessarily converge in aging.
