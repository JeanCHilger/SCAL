Interventional therapy of vascular complications following renal transplantation. Renal transplantation is accepted as the preferred treatment for most cases of end-stage renal disease. Postoperative vascular complications include stenosis or thrombosis of the transplant renal artery or arteriovenous fistulas after biopsy. Impaired arterial perfusion of the transplant may be the leading cause for graft dysfunction or refractory hypertension. Therefore, non-invasive imaging modalities are required to detect and locate vascular complications with high accuracy. Doppler ultrasound is suited as a screening method for the detection of impaired graft perfusion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used for an accurate diagnosis of vascular complications and to support decision for appropriate surgical or interventional treatment. Minimal invasive techniques like percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stent placement have evolved as safe procedures with a high technical success rate reducing substantial morbidity. They can be considered as an alternative to surgical treatment of transplant renal artery stenosis (TRAS). Embolization of severe arteriovenous fistulas is the method of choice if the feeding artery can be occluded through a microcatheter. In selected cases, even catheter-guided fibrinolytic treatment of arterial thrombosis might be considered, if instantaneous surgery is considered a high-risk procedure. This article reviews the imaging features of common vascular complications after renal transplantation with focus on MRI. In addition, interventional radiological techniques are described for the treatment of TRAS, acute thrombotic occlusion, and arteriovenous fistulas.
