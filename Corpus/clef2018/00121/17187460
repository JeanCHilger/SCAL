Monitoring and imaging the clot during systemic thrombolysis in stroke patients. Intravenous thrombolysis is the only approved treatment for acute ischemic stroke when administered within the first 3 h of stroke onset. Response to systemic thrombolysis depends on several factors including the location of arterial occlusion, clot characteristics and, ultimately, the embolic source. In the last few years, tremendous progress has been made, resulting in the widespread implementation of noninvasive neurovascular techniques. These imaging modalities are being increasingly performed in the acute stroke setting, without substantial delay, in a large number of centers worldwide. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound provides a unique opportunity to assess several aspects of clot dissolution by means of continuous monitoring of recanalization during and after tissue plasminogen activator administration. This approach allows for the evaluation of patients at the bedside and in real time due to the commencement, timing, speed and degree of artery reopening in addition to allowing the documentation of reocclusion after successful recanalization. Gradient refocused echo susceptibility vessel sign (GRE SVS) magnetic resonance imaging may be particularly useful for the identification of an intravascular thrombus during the acute phase of ischemic stroke GRE SVS may represent a surrogate of clot composition and differential response to thrombolysis. The increasing availability of advanced neurovascular techniques may, in the near future, improve the design of stroke trials. The capability of these techniques to assess not only tissue viability but also key aspects regarding susceptibility to thrombolysis such as location, amount, composition, and age of the offending clot may improve the safety and efficacy profile of thrombolytic therapy for acute ischemic stroke.
