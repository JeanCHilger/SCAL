Aortic augmentation index is associated with the ankle-brachial index: a community-based study. Increased arterial stiffness has been associated with greater risk of cardiovascular events. We investigated whether aortic augmentation index (AIx), a measure of arterial stiffness and wave reflection, was associated with the ankle-brachial index (ABI), a measure of peripheral arterial disease (PAD).AIx and ABI were measured in a community-based sample of 475 adults without prior history of heart attack or stroke (mean age 59.3 years, 46.5% men). Radial artery pulse waveforms were obtained by applanation tonometry and an ascending aortic pressure waveform derived by a transfer function. AIx is the difference between the first and second systolic peak of the ascending aortic pressure waveform indexed to the central pulse pressure. ABI was measured using a standard protocol, and subjects with non-compressible vessels (ABI >1.5) were excluded from the analyses. Multivariable linear and logistic generalized estimating equations (GEE) analyses were used to assess whether AIx was associated with ABI and ABI <1.00, respectively, independent of conventional risk factors.Mean (+/-S.D.) values were: AIx, 29.3+/-11.6% ABI, 1.12+/-0.13AIx, a measure of arterial stiffness and wave reflection, was independently associated with a lower ABI in asymptomatic subjects from the community, and this association was modified by age.
