Effects of Refined Xuefu Capsule on vascular patency rate after femoral-popliteal bypass. To observe the effects of refined Xuefu Capsule (RXC) in patients with arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO) after femoral-popliteal bypass (FPB).Thirty-eight ASO patients with 41 limbs underwent FPB were randomly assigned to two groups: the control group (18 cases with 20 operated limbs) and the RXC group (20 cases with 21 operated limbs). All patients received long-term anticoagulant treatment with Warfarin, and RXC was given to the RXC group additionally for 3 months. Changes of clinical symptoms, blood coagulating function, as well as the condition of vascular patency and ankle arm index (AAI) were assessed 6 and 12 months after operation.Clinical symptoms were improved in all the patients after operation. One year after operation, incidence of intermittent claudication and amputation rate in the RXC group was 20% and 5 %, being lower than the respective rate (56% and 17%) in the control group (P < 0.05) the patency rate was 86% in the RXC group, being higher than that in the control group (65%, P<0.05). Six and 12 months after operation, AAI was 0.73 +/- 0.24 and 0.69 +/- 0.19 respectively in the RXC group, being significantly higher than that in the control group (0.45 +/- 0.17 and 0.41 +/- 0.23, P < 0.05) at the corresponding time points.RXC could obviously increase the patency rate 12 months after FPB, improve the clinical symptoms and alleviate the symptom of limb ischemia in ASO patients.
