Quality of life improvement and long-term effects of peripheral blood mononuclear cell transplantation for severe arteriosclerosis obliterans in diabetic patients on dialysis. Severe arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO) can be intractable, especially in diabetic patients on hemodialysis (HD). Recently, the transplantation of autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) has been reported to have beneficial effects, but the long-term effects and impact on quality of life (QOL) have not been studied.Autologous PBMNCs were transplanted into 7 diabetic patients on HD who had severe ASO (5 cases with Fontaine IV and 2 with Fontaine III) after administration of 5 microg/kg granulocyte colony stimulating factor QOL and degree of ischemia was assessed by measuring skin temperature, skin perfusion pressure (SPP), ankle-brachial index (ABI), and ulcer size, and from angiographic findings. At 4 weeks after the procedure, skin temperature was significantly improved, and SPP and ABI also were increased. These beneficial effects persisted for up to 24 weeks. Angiographic findings and ulcer size improved in 3 of 7 and 3 of 4 patients, respectively. SF-36v2 analysis revealed significant improvements in pain scores. No serious complications were detected.Transplantation of PBMNCs resulted in improvement in pain and leg ischemia for over 6 months without serious complications. This therapy is safe and effective for severe ASO in diabetic patients on HD.
