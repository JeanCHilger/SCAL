Initial experience with directed laser atherectomy using the CLiRpath photoablation atherectomy system and bias sheath in superficial femoral artery lesions. To report a safety and efficacy study of directed excimer laser atherectomy with the Bias Sheath guiding catheter to create larger lumens in the superficial femoral artery (SFA).Fourteen patients (9 men mean age 66+/-9 years, range 46-76) with chronic lower limb ischemia (Rutherford class 2 to 5) referable to SFA stenoses were treated with the 8-F-compatible Bias Sheath and a 1.7- or 2.0-mm laser catheter. Eight (57%) lesions were de novo and 6 (43%) were in-stent restenoses (ISR). Mean diameter stenosis was 96%+/-8% (range 80%-100%The primary endpoint was achieved in 8 (57%) lesions all patients underwent additional balloon angioplasty, which achieved an angiographic residual stenosis <30% in all. Three lesions could not be completely traversed with the study device. Two dissections were detected after Bias Sheath applicationSFA lesions, including ISR, can be treated in the majority of cases with directed laser atherectomy, significantly reducing plaque burden as measured by IVUS. Embolization was attributed to device-specific features of the prototype antegrade sheath design, which was discontinued. Larger studies are mandatory to document the long-term technical and clinical impact of this new device.
