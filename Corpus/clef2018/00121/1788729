D-SGP Duo--a new plethysmography for acral, arterial and venous blood pressure measurement. This is to present a new portable plethysmograph using modern microprocessor technology, a two-channel digital strain gauge plethysmograph (D-SGP Duo). This system contains two strain gauges and a pressure gauge and has measuring programmes for thrombosis screening (venous occlusion test) and for the acral blood pressure measurement. For the first time it is possible to determine not only the acral systolic arterial pressure but also the acral venous blood pressure. Examples of application are given.
