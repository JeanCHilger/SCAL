Can gamma-glutamyltransferase be an additional marker of arterial stiffness? It has been recently suggested that gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) is independently associated with cardiovascular mortality and atherosclerosis, so the present study evaluated whether GGT is an additional marker of arterial stiffness, independent of other risk factors, in screening cohorts.The 1,387 individuals (741 men, 646 women) who underwent brachial - ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) measurement had their serum levels of GGT, creatinine, uric acid, C-reactive protein, lipids, fasting glucose and insulin, and their hepatitis profiles checked. There were statistically significant increments of baPWV according to quartile of GGT, which was statistically significant in women, but not in men. In logistic regression analysis, age, diabetes mellitus, GGT, heart rate, history of hypertension, triglyceride, and systolic blood pressure were significant variables that influenced increased pulse wave velocity (PWV). After age-and blood pressure-adjustment, GGT, homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance, heart rate, history of hypertension, and metabolic syndrome were significant variables in men, and in women metabolic syndrome and history of hypertension were significant contributors to increased PWV.The present study results suggest that serum GGT may be an additional marker of arterial stiffness, especially in men, though the relationship with arterial stiffness was very weak. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism of GGT's contribution to arteriosclerosis and to confirm the current results.
