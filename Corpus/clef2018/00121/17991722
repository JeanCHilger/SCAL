Therapeutic potential of atrial natriuretic peptide administration on peripheral arterial diseases. Peripheral arterial diseases are caused by arterial sclerosis and impaired collateral vessel formation, which are exacerbated by diabetes, often leading to leg amputation. We have reported that an activation of the natriuretic peptides/cGMP/cGMP-dependent protein kinase pathway accelerated vascular regeneration and blood flow recovery in murine legs, for which ischemia had been induced by a femoral arterial ligation as a model for peripheral arterial diseases. In this study, ip injection of carperitide, a human recombinant atrial natriuretic peptide, accelerated blood flow recovery with increasing capillary density in ischemic legs not only in nondiabetic mice but also in mice kept upon streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemia for 16 wk, which significantly impaired the blood flow recovery compared with nondiabetic mice. Based on these findings, we tried to apply the administration of carperitide to the treatment of peripheral arterial diseases. The study group comprised a continuous series of 13 patients with peripheral arterial diseases (Fontaine's classification I, one II, five
