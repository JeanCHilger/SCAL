Profile and associations of central pulse wave velocity and central pulse pressure among ischemic stroke patients. Arterial stiffness, a known risk factor for atherosclerosis, can be measured directly with carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (CPWV) and indirectly with central pulse pressure (CPP). We aimed to compare central and brachial pulse pressures, and to profile CPWV and CPP among ischemic stroke patients. We studied 198 consecutive prospective ethnic Chinese and South Asian ischemic stroke patients, measuring brachial pressures, central pressures and CPWV under standardized conditions using established methods. The mean CPWV was 11.6 +/- 3.2 m/s and CPP was 64 +/- 28 mmHg. CPP was significantly lower than brachial pulse pressure. CPWV and CPP were both independently associated with older age and hypertension. Among ischemic stroke patients, brachial pulse pressure cannot be used as a surrogate for CPP. Older age and hypertension are associated with arterial stiffening.
