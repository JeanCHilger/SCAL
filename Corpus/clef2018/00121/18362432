Cardio-ankle vascular index is a candidate predictor of coronary atherosclerosis. Recently, arterial stiffness parameter called cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) has been developed. In the current study, using coronary angiographic (CAG) findings, the usefulness of CAVI as a marker of the severity of coronary atherosclerosis was compared with that of carotid atherosclerosis parameters obtained from high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography.A total of 109 participants who underwent CAG were enrolled in the current study. They were divided into 4 groups according to the number of stenotic vessels on CAG no lesion (0VD), 1-vessel (1VD), 2-vessel (2VD) and 3-vessel (3VD) groups. CAVI was significantly higher in 1VD group compared with the 0VD group (p<0.05), and was significantly higher in 2VD and 3VD group compared with the 1VD group. In single regression analysis, CAVI correlated positively with maximum intima-media thickness (IMT) (p<0.01) and plaque score (p<0.0001). A stepwise ordinal logistic regression analysis using mean IMT, maximum IMT, plaque score and CAVI as independent variables identified only CAVI as positively related to the severity of coronary atherosclerosis. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve defined by CAVI was the greatest.CAVI might be more useful for discriminating the probability of coronary atherosclerosis than findings of carotid atherosclerosis by high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography.
