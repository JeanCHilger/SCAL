Association of the -250G/A promoter polymorphism of the hepatic lipase gene with the risk of peripheral arterial disease in type 2 diabetic patients. This study aimed to investigate the association between a polymorphism in the hepatic lipase (LIPC) gene promoter and the presence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in persons with type 2 diabetes.We evaluated 120 type 2 diabetics and identified those with PAD according to the ankle-arm index. The G-250A polymorphisms in the promoter of the LIPC gene were studied by PCR restriction. A logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the association between the rare allele and PAD.The prevalence of PAD was 19%. The frequency of the -250A allele was 0.211 in the group without PAD and 0.395 in the group with PAD (P<.05). Carriers of the -250A allele differed only in the ankle-arm index (0.92+/-0.12 for carriers vs. 1.00+/-0.12 for noncarriers, P<.05), with the difference remaining significant after adjustment for covariates (age sexPatients with type 2 diabetes who are carriers of the rare -250A allele in the promoter of the hepatic lipase gene are susceptible to PAD.
