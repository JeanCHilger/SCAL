Doppler assessment of brachial artery flow as a measure of endothelial dysfunction in pediatric chronic renal failure. Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are highly prevalent among patients with chronic renal failure (CRF). Endothelial dysfunction is regarded as the initial reversible step in the development of atherosclerosis and has been demonstrated in all stages of renal failure. Non-invasive techniques to assess endothelial function have been recently developed and have been proven to predict future mortality in adults. We aimed to assess endothelial function in children with stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD 4) on conservative treatment, using a-non invasive, high-resolution, ultrasound Doppler study of the brachial artery flow, correlating it with other clinical and laboratory parameters. This study included 34 children with CKD 4 on conservative treatment who were compared with 30 healthy controls. Flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), nitroglycerin-mediated dilatation (NTG-MD) and FMD/NTG-MD ratio were estimated. FMD was abnormal (< 5%) in 24 patients (71%). FMD and FMD/NTG-MD ratio were significantly lower in patients than in controls (P = 0.001 and P = 0.01, respectively). FMD correlated positively with serum calcium and negatively with alkaline phosphatase. We concluded that endothelial dysfunction is present in children with CKD 4 on conservative treatment and may reflect increased atherogenic and thrombogenic properties of the endothelium, contributing to subsequent adverse cardiovascular outcome.
