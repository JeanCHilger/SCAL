Long-term results of combined common femoral endarterectomy and iliac stenting/stent grafting for occlusive disease. Common femoral artery (CFA) endarterectomy with iliac stenting or stent grafting can be an alternative to traditional open surgery in patients with aortoiliac occlusive disease. We report the long-term outcomes of this approach.Patients undergoing CFA endarterectomy with simultaneous iliac stenting/stent grafting between 1997 and 2006 were retrospectively reviewed. Technical success, clinical and hemodynamic outcomes, and 5-year patency using life-table methodology were determined. Factors associated with reintervention and mortality were determined by logistic regression analysis.A total of 171 patients (mean age, 67 +/- 10 years 38% femaleCombined CFA endarterectomy with iliac intervention yield acceptable long-term results. The use of stent grafts compared with bare stents is associated with improved primary patency.
