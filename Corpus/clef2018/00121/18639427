Common femoral artery occlusive disease: contemporary results following surgical endarterectomy. Proliferation of endovascular techniques with perceived reduction in treatment morbidity repetitively question the precept that surgical endarterectomy is the preferred treatment for occlusive disease of the common femoral artery (CFA). This study details a contemporary experience with common femoral endarterectomy (CFE) with and without concomitantly performed endovascular therapies.Technical, hemodynamic, and clinical success of CFE performed between 2002 and 2005 were determined according to the Society of Vascular Surgery reporting standards. Primary and assisted patencies of the CFA segment, freedom from reintervention in the ipsilateral limb, and survival were assessed using Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis. Multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate factors associated with patency and survival.CFE was performed on 65 limbs in 58 patients (mean age 71 +/- 10 male 77%These data suggest CFE should remain the standard of care for occlusive disease of the CFA. Its safety and efficacy establish a standard for comparison with emerging endovascular therapies.
