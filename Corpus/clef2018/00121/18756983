A clinical trial of using antiplatelet therapy to prevent restenosis following peripheral artery angioplasty and stenting. To evaluate the clinical effect and restenosis rate of antiplatelet therapy following peripheral artery angioplasty and stenting.After successful placement of peripheral artery stents to 103 patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) in were randomized assigned to 2 groups: antiplatelet therapy group receiving clopidogrel 75 mg plus aspirin 100 mg (n = 56) and control group (n = 47) receiving anticoagulation therapy low molecular weight heparin (LWMH) for 7 d plus long-term warfarin. The patients were followed up 1 day, and 1, 6, 12, and 18 months after the operation to undergo color Doppler ultrasonography, and examinations of blood routine, bleeding time, coagulation time, and ankle-brachial Index. The primary endpoint events included major bleeding rate, and composite rate of restenosis and reocclusion. The secondary endpoint events included cardiovascular events, death, and adverse drug reaction.There were no significant differences in the baseline data between these two groups. The thrombotic occlusion rate was 1.8% in the antiplatelet group and 0% in control group, and the restenosis rate was 14.3% in the antiplatelet group and 25.5% in control group (both P > 0.05). The bleeding complication rate of the antiplatelet group was 1.8%, significantly lower than that of the anticoagulation group (19.1%, P < 0.01). There were not significant differences in cardiovascular event rate and mortality 18 months after operation between these two groups.Antiplatelet therapy combined with clopidogrel plus aspirin is effective and safe in preventing restenosis following peripheral artery angioplasty and stenting.
