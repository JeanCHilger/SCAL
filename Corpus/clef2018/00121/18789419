The extent of lower extremity occlusive disease predicts short- and long-term patency following endovascular infrainguinal arterial intervention. Endovascular revascularization of the femoral-politeal arterial segment has gained acceptance despite lower patency than surgical bypass due to lower morbidity. Choosing patients that are ideal candidates for endovascular therapy remains controversial. We have assessed hemodynamic factors that might predict longer primary patency after endovascular therapy.Ninety-nine limbs were treated with endovascular therapy from January 2001 to January 2005 with a mean and median follow-up of 338 and 293 days. Primary patency was considered lost when recurrent symptoms developed, ankle-brachial index (ABI) decreased following initial improvement, or a subsequent procedure was required. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to evaluate patency.Patients with an ABI > or =.5 prior to intervention had longer primary patency compared to those with an ABI less than .5 (P = .043). Having 1 or more patent tibial runoff vessels was associated with improved patency for the first 24 months post-procedure (P = .001).Patients with an ABI > or =.5 or at least 1 patent tibial vessel runoff have significantly higher hemodynamic and clinical success following endovascular therapy of the femoral-popliteal arterial segment.
