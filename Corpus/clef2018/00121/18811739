Identification and management of polyvascular disease in patients with noncardioembolic ischaemic stroke. Recent registry results have shown that polyvascular disease (PolyVD), usually manifested as coronary heart disease or peripheral arterial disease (PAD), is a marker of increased morbidity and mortality in patients with noncardioembolic ischaemic stroke, but is often inadequately assessed. This Personal View Paper advocates routine examination for PolyVD in such patients. Peripheral arterial disease can be readily detected in routine practice by measurement of the ankle-brachial index. This paper makes recommendations for risk stratification, discharge documentation and, where possible, management of ischaemic stroke patients with PolyVD.
