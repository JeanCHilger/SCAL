Intensity of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion determines white/gray matter injury and cognitive/motor dysfunction in mice. We sought to establish a mouse model of subcortical ischemic vascular dementia (SIVD) that develops predominant white matter (WM) injury and cognitive dysfunction induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. Adult C57Bl/6 male (n = 48) mice were subjected to bilateral common carotid artery stenosis with external microcoils (inner diameters: 0.16 mm, left 0.18 mm, right). Mice were categorized according to left-side cerebral blood flow (CBF) value on day 6 into those with severe cerebral hypoperfusion (SCH
