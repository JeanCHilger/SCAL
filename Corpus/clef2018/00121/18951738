A rare cause of embolic ischemia of the hand: an isolated aneurism of a branch of the axillary artery. A 48-year-old man was admitted for subacute ischemia of the right hand of sudden onset. The patient, who participated in amateur sports, had an uneventful medical history. Duplex ultrasonography revealed thrombosis of the right radial and ulnar arteries. On heparin, the clinical course was favorable and investigations to search for an embolic source revealed an aneurism of the posterior circumflex artery (arteriography). The etiological work-up was negative as was the search for other aneurismal locations. Surgical excision was carried out. Pathology examination of the surgical specimen revealed a thrombosed aneurism that had developed on an atherosclerotic plaque. Aneurisms of the posterior circumflex artery have been described in professional baseball and volleyball players, but all sports that involve repetitive movements of the arm at extension, external rotation and forced abduction can complicate such damage. Compression of the aneurismal artery by the humeral head leads to extrusion of the thrombus under pressure and to retrograde embolisation towards the leg arteries. Thus, in the same way as for hypothenar hammer syndrome, signs of distal ischemia in an athlete should lead to a search for this type of injury.
