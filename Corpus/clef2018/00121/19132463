Stent placement for superficial femoral arterial occlusive disease in high-risk patients: preliminary results. To report the preliminary results of primary stenting of the superficial femoral artery (SFA) in high-risk patients with symptomatic SFA occlusive disease.Between February 2005 and April 2007, a collective 30 lower limbs in 28 high-risk patients with SFA occlusive disease were treated by primary stenting. Hemodynamic improvement was assessed by ankle brachial pressure index (ABI), before and after the procedure. Primary and primary-assisted patency and limb salvage were measured in concordance with the Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines.The technical success rate was 97%. The average ABI before and after stent placement increased significantly, from 0.41 +/- 0.33 to 0.82 +/- 0.20 (P < 0.001). The primary and primary-assisted patency rates were 86% and 90% at 6 months, 86% and 90% at 12 months, and 68% and 90% at 24 months, respectively. The limb salvage rate was 92% at 6, 12, and 24 months and the survival rate was 95% at 6, 12, and 24 months.Our results suggest that the primary stenting of SFA lesions is a feasible, safe, and effective procedure for high-risk patients with SFA occlusive disease.
