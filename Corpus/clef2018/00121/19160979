SMART control stents in femoropopliteal region. Occlusive disease of lower limb arteries have been so far traditionally best treated with bypass surgery, but we want to find minimally invasive approach that should be at least as good as conventional surgery, and hopefully better. The aim of this study was to evaluate SMART Control stents (Cordis, J&J) in Trans Atlantic Society Consensus (TASC) B and C femoropopliteal lesions during one-year follow-up.Retrospective nonrandomized analysis included forty arteries in consecutive 40 patients who were stented with SMART Control stents. Primary patency at 12-month verified with Duplex Ultrasound and Acute Brachial Index (ABI) as well as freedom from Target Vessel Revascularization (TVR) were primary endpoints.Primary technical success at stent implantation was 100%. Mean ABI values were preprocedurally 0.50, postprocedurally 0.83, at one month 0.86, at six months 0.84, at one year 0.78. After one year 39 stents were patent (97.5%).Excellent performance of the stent from technical point of view and a midterm results in vessel patency, as well as the absence of need for TVR were achieved. Yet, life expectancy in this cohort group of patients demands longer follow up data to draw a definite sustained positive conclusion.
