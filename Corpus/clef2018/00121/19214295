An unusual case of hypertensive diastolic heart failure with bilateral subclavian artery stenosis. Severe stenosis or occlusion of the subclavian artery is a rare clinical finding, even more so for bilateral existence of the condition. Subclavian artery stenosis and occlusion leads to erroneously low blood pressure values when measured at the brachial artery on the ipsilateral side. Widespread clinical reliance on a sole brachial measurement of blood pressure, particularly in the emergency room setting, may result in inappropriate clinical management in patients with conditions that alter brachial blood pressure. Currently, there is no published English-language literature on the implications of bilateral subclavian artery stenosis and occlusion in heart failure. A case of an apparently hypotensive patient with frequent emergency room visits for symptoms of heart failure exacerbation is presented.
