Let's think in alkaline phosphatase at heart function. In their recent paper, Cheung et al [B.M. Cheung, K.L. Ong, L.Y. Wong, Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase and peripheral arterial disease in the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2004. Int J Cardiol 2008 (Electronic publication ahead of print)] described a significant association between serum alkaline phosphatase levels and low ankle-brachial blood pressure index, a risk factor for cardiovascular pathology. We had verified that alkaline phosphatase is present at the rat heart, showing a distribution compatible with cardiomyocyte sarcoplasmic reticulum. Moreover, several drugs with cardiac effect were shown to interfere with heart alkaline phosphatase activity. We therefore propose that alkaline phosphatase may be a local regulator at heart function and a putative target for therapeutic interventions.
