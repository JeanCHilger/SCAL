Bone mineral density, arterial stiffness, and coronary atherosclerosis in healthy postmenopausal women. The aim of this study was to assess the correlation between bone mineral density (BMD), arterial stiffness, and coronary atherosclerosis in healthy postmenopausal women.We performed a retrospective review of 152 postmenopausal women who visited the health promotion center for a routine checkup, after excluding participants who had factors affecting BMD and coronary artery disease. BMD was evaluated by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry in the lumbar spine and femur. Arterial stiffness was measured by brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), and coronary atherosclerosis was assessed by 64-row multidetector computed tomography.Women with osteoporosis had a significantly higher baPWV than those in the osteopenia and normal BMD groups. Higher baPWV was also associated with the presence of atherosclerosis. The baPWV was significantly positively correlated with age, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and negatively correlated with femur BMD. The optimum predictive value of baPWV in coronary atherosclerosis was estimated using the receiver operating characteristic curve. A cutoff of 1,506 cm/second would give a sensitivity of 83.3% and specificity of 82.9%. A higher overall risk for coronary atherosclerosis emerges with higher baPWV levels (>1,500 cm/s) after controlling for age and cardiovascular risk factors.Arterial stiffness by measuring baPWV can be a useful independent predictor for coronary atherosclerosis. In addition, our results suggest that postmenopausal women with osteoporosis should be considered for further evaluation of coronary atherosclerosis.
