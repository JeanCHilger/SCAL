Historical reflections on hypertension. Sixty million Americans have hypertension, a major cardiovascular risk factor. Its presence accelerates the atherosclerotic process, producing strokes, heart attacks, heart failure, renal failure, and peripheral vascular disease. This article highlights the historical landmarks in the study of this disease from the first documented measurement of blood pressure in 1733, through the most recent pharmacologic approaches to treatment. In addition, the roles of the kidney and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are examined.
