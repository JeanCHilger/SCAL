Association of serum myeloperoxidase with the ankle-brachial index and peripheral arterial disease. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is an enzymatic mediator of several inflammatory cascades and higher serum levels have been associated with increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events. We investigated the association of serum MPO with the ankle-brachial index (ABI) and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in a bi-ethnic cohort of African-Americans and non-Hispanic white individuals. Participants included 1324 African-Americans (mean age 64 years, 71% women) and 1237 non-Hispanic white individuals (mean age 59 years, 57% women) belonging to hypertensive sibships. Serum levels of MPO were measured by solid phase sandwich immunoassay. ABI was measured using a standard protocol and PAD was defined as an ABI < 0.90. Multivariable regression analysis using generalized estimating equations were performed to assess whether serum MPO levels were associated with ABI and the presence of PAD. After adjustment for age and sex, higher MPO levels were significantly associated with lower ABI and the presence of PAD in African-Americans (p = 0.004 and p = 0.005, respectively) and in non-Hispanic white individuals (p = 0.001 and p = 0.016, respectively). After additional adjustment for conventional risk factors (diabetes, smoking status, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, waist circumference, hypertension), prior history of myocardial infarction or stroke, and medication use (statins, aspirin, estrogen), higher MPO levels remained significantly associated with lower ABI and the presence of PAD in both African-Americans (p = 0.008 and p = 0.010, respectively) and non-Hispanic white individuals (p = 0.001 and p = 0.018, respectively). We conclude that higher MPO levels are associated with lower ABI and the presence of PAD in African-Americans and non-Hispanic white individuals.
