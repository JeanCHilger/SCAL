Primary stenting for renal fibromuscular-dysplastic stenosis: a case report. Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a non-inflammatory, non-atherosclerotic vascular disease that has been reported in renal and internal carotid arteries and in almost every arterial bed, primarily affecting young to middle-aged people, mainly female individuals. These patients may be asymptomatic or may present with hypertension. A 29 year-old hypertensive woman was referred for a renal color Doppler ultrasound (CDU) scan because of a suspicion of renovascular hypertension and we revealed the presence of three separate stenosis on the right renal artery. Digital selective angiography (DSA) and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) were performed but an incomplete dilation of the vessel was obtained. Because of the suboptimal result, it was decided to stent the lesions during two different procedures. Percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty is the primary treatment of renal FMD, but should not be excluded primary stent implantation as an alternative technique to surgical revascularization.
