Evidence-based recommendations on primary diagnostics of peripheral arterial occlusive disease in geriatric patients. The prevalence of peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) is high in elderly patients and its clinical manifestation is often atypical. Comorbidity and morbidity as a consequence of PAOD are significant. Therefore, standardized primary diagnostics are required among geriatric patients. Drawn from a search of the literature, evidence-based recommendations are provided. Pulse palpation and the evaluation of a patient's medical history are obligatory components of primary diagnostics, even in the absence of typical symptoms. In the case of pathological and ambiguous findings, measuring Doppler ankle pressures is suggested as the next diagnostic step. Further measures depend on the following factors: the presence of lesions on the leg with disturbed blood flow, predominantly in the foot and lower leg areas, degree of PAOD-related ailments, and, finally, intended surgery of the affected leg for other medical reasons.
