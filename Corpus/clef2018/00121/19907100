Effects of pitavastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a reductase inhibitor, on cardio-ankle vascular index in type 2 diabetic patients. A novel device has been developed for measuring the cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) as an indicator of arterial stiffness. In this study, we evaluated the effect of pitavastatin on CAVI in type 2 diabetic patients.Forty-five type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with low-density lipoprotein cholesterolemia were enrolled and treated with pitavastatin 2 mg/day for 12 months. Before and after pitavastatin administration, HbA1c, serum lipids, serum malondialdehyde-LDL (MDA-LDL), urinary 8-hydroxy- 2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and CAVI were measured.After pitavastatin treatment for 12 months, significant decreases in 8-OHdG, MDA-LDL and CAVI were observed. DeltaCAVI significantly correlated with DeltaMDA-LDL.In type 2 diabetic patients, pitavastatin may have an oxidative stress-reducing effect, especially in a state of enhanced oxidative stress, and CAVI may be useful as a routine test for the diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of atherosclerosis.
