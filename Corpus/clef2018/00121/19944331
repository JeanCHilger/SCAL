Rare case of paradoxical embolism causing myocardial infarction: successfully aborted by aspiration alone. A 58-year-old male presented with severe substernal chest pain along with bilateral lower extremity pain. He was tachycardic, tachypneic, and hypoxic with tender right calf. Electrocardiogram showed ST elevation in anterior-lateral leads. Emergency coronary angiography revealed widely patent proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery and total distal occlusion with an abrupt cut-off. The remaining coronary arteries did not have significant disease. An Export aspiration catheter was used and thrombus was aspirated from the LAD with return of TIMI flow grade 3 and normalization of the ST elevations. Doppler ultrasound revealed deep vein thrombosis transthoracic echocardiogram using agitated saline echocontrast showed a patent foramen ovale. Nearly 5% of patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction do not have demonstrable atherosclerosis by coronary angiography
