The versatility of propeller flaps for lower limb reconstruction in patients with peripheral arterial obstructive disease: initial experience. In this study, we evaluate the feasibility of propeller flaps, for soft tissue reconstruction in patients with peripheral arterial obstructive disease (PAOD). Five patients (average age, 72 years old), presenting with necrosis of several foot units, were diagnosed with stage IV PAOD and diabetes mellitus. All underwent revascularization, followed by soft tissue reconstruction using propeller flaps. A total of 6 flaps were performed, with dimensions ranging from 4 x 7 cm to 8 x 31 cm. Perforator origin was the peroneal (5 flaps) or the tibial posterior artery (1 flap). Average operative time was 190 minutes. Overall patency was 83.3% 1 case was complicated with total flap loss followed by below-knee amputation
