The electroacupuncture in patients recently operated for peripheral arterial disease. A comparative study of the two electrostimulation techniques. Possible hemodynamic effects of electro acupuncture (A), by two electro stimulation techniques, were studied at patients with femuro - popliteal bypass revascularization. MMATERIAL AND METHOD:In a prospective study, we evaluated two EA techniques, by calculating the ankle-brachial index (ABI) and by estimating the pain with Numeric Rating Scale (NRS: 0 - 10). The patients were grouped in lot A (30 patients) and B (50 patients) according with the EA technique used. In both lots were used the same acupuncture points (acupoint): Pc6, P9, St36 and Sp6. These acupoints are adjacent to peripheral nerves median, radial, peroneal and safenous nerve. Needles, after insertion, were kept in place for 30 minutes. The electro stimulation (2 Hz) was only for 2 minutes in the lot A and for 30 minutes in the lot B.The blood pressure data and ABI shows a significant increase of ABI (between 0.033 and 0.052) after EA at 5 minutes in the both lots (p < 0.05). At 30 minutes, ABI is increased in lot B, but in the lot A the ABI is elevated only at the non surgical leg (p < 0.05). The decrease of pain post EA is better in the lot B (NRS: initially 2.48--post EA pain decreased to 1.46 and remained 1.66 at 2 hours p < 0.001), than lot A.The electro stimulation of certain acupoints, at the operated peripheral arterial disease patients, interfere with tissular perfusion and increase temporally ABI. The pain is diminished more significantly by the 30 minutes electro stimulating technique.
