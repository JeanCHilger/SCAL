The Allen's test: analysis of four methods. Forty nonrandomly selected hands were studied with use of four types of Allen's test: (1) the digital systolic blood pressure method, (2) the subjective method, (3) the pulse oximeter method, and (4) the laser Doppler flowmetry method. The digital systolic blood pressure method, regarded as the standard, indicated abnormal pressure in three hands. Laser Doppler flowmetry gave the same results as those obtained by the digital systolic pressure method and, in addition, was easier to perform. Pulse oximetry falsely indicated adequacy of the collateral circulation in two of the three hands with abnormal digital systolic pressure. Eleven hands, including the three with abnormal digital systolic pressure, were abnormal according to the subjective method. The results of the present study indicate the following: (1) the laser Doppler Allen's test is accurate, quick, and easy to perform (2) the pulse oximeter Allen's test should not be used because of potentially dangerous consequences to the patient in the event of a falsely normal result
