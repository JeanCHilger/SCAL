Proteinuria is a risk factor for proximal type of peripheral vascular disease in type 2 diabetic patients. The levels of creatinine, urea, uric acid, UPE and blood pressure were measured in the groups of Type 2 diabetics with proximal (iliocofemoral) type (PRMA) and distal (tibial) type of macroangiopathy (DIMA) (diagnosed by means of Doppler ultrasound technique) and in a control group without lower limb macroangiopathy. Both UPE and creatinine mean values were significantly increased in the PRMA group in comparison with controls. Uric acid levels were increased in both PRMA and DIMA groups and mean urea values did not differ significantly in all three groups of patients. Systolic blood pressure values were similar in each group as well. However, a significant increase of mean diastolic pressure has been observed in the group with DIMA. In addition, significant correlation was observed between the thigh/arm index (expressing the perfusion through the ilicofemoral segment) and UPE (r = -0.464 p less than 0.001). This relationship persisted also in multivariate analysis where UPE was the only factor which entered the "best fit model". The results of the present study indicate that proteinuria might be a risk factor or a marker for proximal type of peripheral vascular disease in Type 2 diabetic mellitus.
