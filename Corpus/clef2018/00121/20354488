Percutaneous interventions below the knee in patients with critical limb ischemia using drug eluting stents. Midterm technical and clinical evaluation of stent angioplasty with drug-eluting stents in infrapopliteal lesions in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI).Percutaneous stent angioplasty was performed in 128 limbs in 114 patients presenting with 320 vascular lesions. Lesions with up to 6 cm in length and at least one patent vessel below the obstruction were treated 341 drug-eluting Cypher(R) stents (diameter of 2.5-3.5 mmTechnical success was achieved in 99.06%. Minor complications (hematoma, distal emboli, and vessel dissection) were documented in 8.77% of the patients. The 6, 12, and 18 months primary patency rate as controlled by Duplex sonography was 89.8, 84.2 and 83.3%, respectively 77.6% of the lesions healed postinterventionally. The cumulative limb salvage rate was 95.6%.Drug-eluting stent (DES) angioplasty in infrapopliteal arteries is a safe and effective technique for the treatment of patients with CLI. The use of a DES results in favorable technical and clinical outcome in the midterm follow-up.
