Role of uric acid in the link between arterial stiffness and cardiac hypertrophy: a cross-sectional study. Hyperuricaemia has been linked to atherosclerosis however, there is limited evidence about its association with arterial stiffness and cardiac hypertrophy, which are associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes. We studied the association of hyperuricaemia with an increased risk of arterial stiffness and cardiac hypertrophy in a population participating in a health-screening programme.In subjects who underwent health screening from 2005 to 2007, arterial stiffness was measured by brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), whereas cardiac hypertrophy was determined by plain chest radiography and electrocardiography. Polychotomous logistic regression was used to identify associations of hyperuricaemia with arterial stiffness and cardiac hypertrophy, after adjusting for the presence of metabolic syndrome.Of the total 9375 subjects enrolled, 1324 (14.5%) had hyperuricaemia. Subjects with hyperuricaemia had a significantly higher baPWV [1618.8 (379.3) cm/s] than those without it [1501.8 (334.9) cm/s]. Cardiac hypertropy was observed in 1047 (11.2%) subjects. Hyperuricaemia was associated with cardiac hypertrophy with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.53 (95% CI 1.32, 1.77). Polychotomous logistic regression showed that hyperuricaemia was associated with ORs (95% CI) for coexisting abnormal baPWV and cardiac hypertrophy of 1.75 (95% CI 1.24, 2.47) and 1.41 (95% CI 1.04, 1.91) in men and women, respectively, after adjusting for age, proteinuria, high high-sensitive CRP, abnormal ankle-brachial index or a number of metabolic syndrome components present.Hyperuricaemia was associated with arterial stiffness and cardiac hypertrophy. Hyperuricaemia, along with other risk factors related to atherosclerosis, could play a role in the development of cardiac hypertrophy by increasing arterial stiffness.
