Kodamaea ohmeri fungemia in an immunocompetent patient treated with micafungin: case report and review of the literature. Kodamaea (Pichia) ohmeri is an unusual yeast-form fungus that has recently been identified as an important etiology of fungemia, endocarditis, cellulitis, funguria and peritonitis in immunocompromised patients. We report a case of K. ohmeri fungemia in a 34-year-old hospitalized patient with thrombophlebitis. The patient was admitted to the hospital for evaluation and management of an acquired tracheo-esophageal fistula secondary to an impacted denture. Fever developed on hospital day 22, and physical exam revealed right arm superficial thrombophlebitis at the site of the peripheral venous catheter that was confirmed by Doppler ultrasound. The peripheral vein was removed and blood cultures from hospital day 22 and 23 grew yeast species. The yeast was subsequently identified to be K. ohmeri by Vitek II and API20C and was confirmed by 18S rRNA gene sequencing. The fungemia and right arm phlebitis was successfully treated with a 2-week course of micafungin therapy. This is the first case of K. ohmeri fungemia in a patient that was successfully treated with micafungin.
