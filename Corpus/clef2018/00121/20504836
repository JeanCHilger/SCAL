Cilostazol increases skin perfusion pressure in severely ischemic limbs. Skin perfusion pressure (SPP) is a measure of peripheral circulation low SPP (<40 mm Hg) indicates poor wound healing. Cilostazol is used to alleviate symptoms and improve walking distance in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD), but its effect on SPP is unknown. We enrolled patients whose symptoms were Rutherford class 3 or 4 and whose SPP was <40 mm Hg. We analyzed patient symptoms, ankle-brachial index (ABI), and SPP before and 1 month after treatment with cilostazol. We analyzed 20 legs of 14 patients. Cilostazol improved symptoms in 12 legs. The average heart rate increased from 76 ± 16 to 84 ± 20 beats/min (P < .05). Cilostazol did not increase the ABI but caused a significant increase in the SPP from 24.5 ± 8.88 to 42.8 ± 21.0 mm Hg (P < .01). Cilostazol increases microvascular circulation in severely ischemic limbs and may be useful in critical limb ischemia.
