The ankle-brachial index is associated with the magnitude of impaired walking endurance among men and women with peripheral arterial disease. Previous reports suggest that the severity of peripheral arterial disease (PAD), measured by the ankle-brachial index (ABI), is not associated with the magnitude of walking impairment, measured by treadmill testing. These prior studies have had small sample sizes and included only PAD participants with symptoms of intermittent claudication. We studied the association of the ABI with diverse measures of walking performance in a cross-sectional study of 156 participants with PAD with and without intermittent claudication symptoms. Outcomes included the Gardner-Skinner treadmill test, 6-minute walk, 4-meter walking velocity at usual and fastest pace, and the walking impairment questionnaire (WIQ). Adjusting for age, sex, race, comorbidities, leg symptoms, and other confounders, lower ABI values were associated with shorter distance achieved in the 6-minute walk (ABI < 0.50: 286 meters ABI 0.50-0.70: 316 meters
