Test-retest reliability of isokinetic strength and endurance tests in patients with intermittent claudication. The objective was to determine the reliability of isokinetic strength and endurance testing in the ankle joints of patients with intermittent claudication. Twenty-three patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) and symptoms of intermittent claudication participated in the study. Isokinetic strength and endurance testing of the ankle joint were performed in symptomatic and asymptomatic legs on 3 separate days. Intraclass coefficient correlation of peak torque (PT) and total work (TW) ranged from 0.77 to 0.92 and 0.89 to 0.96, respectively. PT and TW increased significantly and similarly in both legs from day 1 to day 2 (PT: +42 +/- 84% in the symptomatic leg and +33 +/- 51% in the asymptomatic leg, p < 0.05TW: +38 +/- 26% in the symptomatic leg and +26 +/- 50% in the asymptomatic leg, p < 0.05). In conclusion, isokinetic strength and endurance testing in the ankle joints of patients with PAD presents reliability coefficients ranging from 0.77 to 0.96. However, strength and endurance increased between the first and the other test sessions performed on separate days, suggesting that two test sessions are necessary for the accurate evaluation of strength and endurance in patients with PAD.
