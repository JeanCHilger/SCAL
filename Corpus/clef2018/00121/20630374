Carotid artery occlusive disease and ocular manifestations: Importance of identifying patients at risk. Ocular manifestations of carotid artery occlusive disease, when present, warrant further systemic workup including carotid artery Doppler ultrasound scan. Vascular ocular pathology that may indicate underlying carotid artery disease includes amaurosis fugax, retinal emboli, ocular ischemic syndrome, retinal vascular occlusions, and glaucoma. Early atherosclerotic changes, however, may remain undetected with carotid artery Doppler ultrasound scan. Risk factors for atherosclerosis should be assessed, and additional imaging to detect underlying pathophysiology of carotid artery occlusive disease may also be indicated for preventative management. A review of the literature is conducted to determine the association of ocular sequelae with hemodynamically significant carotid artery stenosis. The role of brachial artery flow-mediated dilation as an independent predictor for cardiovascular disease is also discussed.
