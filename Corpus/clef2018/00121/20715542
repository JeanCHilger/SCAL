Assessment of the quality of the newly developed rapid oscillometric blood pressure measurement. The purpose of this study is to examine the accuracy of the Fukuda Denshi DS-7000 noninvasive blood pressure measurement device equipped with two cuff deflation mode: a normal mode and quick mode.Twenty-one patients undergoing elective surgery were divided into two groups by using cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI): no atherosclerotic group and atherosclerotic group. During anesthesia, two modes of blood pressure measurements were examined with the normal mode followed by the quick mode.All the patients completed the study, resulting in a total of 1034 paired blood pressure measurements. In both no atherosclerotic group and atherosclerotic group, there were statistically significant correlations among systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure in two modes. This results certified the accuracy of the quick mode measurement.The newly developed rapid oscillometric blood pressure measurement can be useful for perioperative management especially in atherosclerotic patients.
