Acute and long-term outcome of Silverhawk assisted atherectomy for femoro-popliteal lesions according the TASC II classification: a single-center experience. Directional atherectomy (DA) has become popular in some centers to remove atherosclerotic plaques in femoro-popliteal lesions. Although immediate and also short - term outcome data are promising, solid long-term data are warranted to justify the widespread use in daily practice.In this prospective study de novo and restenotic lesions of the femoro-popliteal segments were treated with the Silverhawk device. 161 consecutive patients (164 lesions) with peripheral artery disease (PAD) Rutherford classes 2 to 5 were included from June 2002 to October 2004 and October 2006 to June 2007 (59 % male, mean age 67 +/- 11 years, range 40 to 88) and the outcome analyzed according to the TASC II classification.DA alone was performed successfully in 28 % (n = 46), adjunctive balloon angioplasty in 65 % (n = 107) and stenting in 7 % (n = 11). The overall technical success rate was 76 % (124 / 164) and the procedural success rate 95 % (154 / 164). At 12 months primary patency rate was 61 % (85 / 140) and the secondary patency rate was 75 % (105 / 140) in the entire cohort, being less favourable in TASC D compared to TASC A to C lesions (p = 0.034 and p < 0.001, respectively). Furthermore the restenosis rate differed trendwise (p = 0.06) between de novo and restenotic lesions. Changes in the ABI and the Rutherford classes were significantly in favour of TASC A to C lesions compared to TASC D after 12 months (p = 0.004). The event free survival (MI, TIA, or restenosis) was 48 % at 12 months and 38.5 % at 24 months. Predictor for restenosis in the multivariable analysis was only male gender (p=0.04).The results in TASC D lesions are inferior to those in the lesser stages. DA of femoro-popliteal arteries leads shows a trend to better long-term technical and clinical outcome in de novo lesions compared to restenotic lesions.
