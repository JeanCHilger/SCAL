Relationship of arterial stiffness and early mild diastolic heart failure in general middle and aged population. The brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) has been recognized as a marker that reflects arterial stiffness. We conducted an investigation to evaluate whether baPWV is independently associated with early mild diastolic heart failure (DHF) in a general middle and aged population.From 1 July 2009 until 31 August 2009, we investigated 2095 subjects for the relevant factors of heart failure in the Lujiazui Community, Shanghai. The baPWV, echocardiography, and blood sampling were performed in the morning after a 12 h overnight fast. A total of 1929 subjects had the complete data, including questionnaire, age, gender, baPWV, brain natriuretic peptide, and E/A ratio. Early mild DHF was defined as a left ventricular ejection fraction >50%, E/A ratio <0.8, and E/E' ≤ 8 finally, 482 subjects with early mild DHF and 1282 subjects with non-DHF entered into analysis. Among 1764 subjects, 31.6% of the subjects were male (average age was 58.0 ± 12.3), 35.8% of the subjects had hypertension, the average body mass index (BMI) was 24.2 ± 3.3 kg/m(2), baPWV was 1513.0 (1329.1, 1763.5) cm/s, and the baPWV was significantly correlated with the E/A ratio (r = -0.39, P < 0.01). There was a difference of the baPWV [1456.0 (1295.3, 1698.3) vs. 1670.5 (1465.6, 1910.8) cm/s] between the non-DHF group and the early mild DHF group (P < 0.01). Multiple logistic-regression analyses demonstrated that age, male gender, BMI, baPWV, posterior left ventricular wall thickness (PVWT), interventricular septal thickness (IVST), E/E' ratio, left ventricular mass index (LVMI), systolic blood pressure (≥140 mmHg), and diastolic blood pressure (≥90 mmHg) were independently correlated with early mild DHF.The increased arterial stiffness is associated with early mild DHF in a general middle and aged population independently of age, male gender, BMI, PVWT, IVST, E/E' ratio, LVMI, and high blood pressure. The non-invasive techniques described may allow serial measurements to be made over time to monitor baPWV changes in arteries provided the introduction of anti-arteriosclerosis therapy.
