The Simpson atherectomy catheter in the management of complete obstructions. The Simpson atherectomy catheter has been used successfully to recanalise eleven complete occlusions of the iliac and femoropopliteal arteries. Atherectomy and angioplasty were used in combination in 8 cases. Following atherectomy, all patients showed clinical improvement. Distal pulses returned in 7 rest pain and/or claudication disappeared in the other 4. Ischaemic ulcers healed in the 2 affected patients. Overall, ankle-arm indices (AAI) improved by an average of 0.43, with the improvement being greatest (0.55) in patients in whom the lumen was recanalised to within 91-100% of the native luminal diameter. Seven patients have remained with stable AAI values and without change in their clinical status at 18 months follow-up.
