The contribution of pulsed Doppler in kidney transplantation. In order to evaluate the value of pulsed-Doppler studies in renal transplantation, we analyzed 101 procedures in 89 transplant recipients. The resistivity indices was used to quantify results. In 45 children with no complications, pulsed-Doppler results were normal. No arterial signal was present in seven recipients. Thrombosis of the renal artery was confirmed upon arteriography and surgery in all these cases. Eight patients had stenosis of the renal artery that was demonstrated upon the pulsed-Doppler study and confirmed upon arteriography. Among 18 patients with acute tubular necrosis, 12 had normal pulsed-Doppler results, two had a diastolic flow decrease, and four had abolition of diastolic flow. Among five recipients with cellular rejection, four had a normal pulsed-Doppler study, one a diastolic flow decrease, and one abolition of diastolic flow. Among six recipients with vascular rejection, two exhibited flow reversal and three had abolition of diastolic flow. Pulsed-Doppler is a good tool for studying vascular complications involving renal transplants and helps differentiate vascular rejection from other complications.
