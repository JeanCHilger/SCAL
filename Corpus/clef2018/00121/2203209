Use of computer-assisted Doppler sonography and rheography in acral vascular diagnosis in progressive systemic sclerosis. For the quantitative characterization of the blood flow of patients with progressive systemic sclerosis a combined computer-assisted Doppler sonographic as well as rheographic measuring place was established. An aimed examination of the peripheral situation of the blood supply was performed in 15 patients with progressive systemic sclerosis in comparison to a control group of patients with healthy vessels. The demonstration of the corresponding parameters of time and form of the curves resulted in significant differences for the two examination groups, particularly of the pulsation index (PI) and the index of the peripheral resistance (PWI) in the Doppler flow curves as well as for the maximum increase (A) and the peak time (GZ) in the rheogrammes. The computer-assisted functional-diagnostic investigation methods in the peripheral vascular region offer themselves for the objectivation and the assessment of the course of the participation of the vessels in the collagenoses.
