Functional limitation and intermittent claudication: impact of blood pressure measurements. Arterial hypertension is an important risk factor for Lower-Limb Occlusive Arterial Disease (LLOAD). However, the correlation between blood pressure and pulse pressure (PP) with LLOAD severity and functional impairment resulting from this disease is not well established in the Brazilian population.To verify whether there is a correlation between blood pressure, PP, LLOAD severity and functional capacity in patients with symptomatic LLOAD.A total of 65 patients (62.2 + 8.1 years, 56.9% males) were evaluated. They were divided into two groups: normal (A) and high (B) blood pressure. LLOAD severity was assessed using the ankle-brachial index (ABI) and functional capacity by the total and pain-free walking distance at the 6-minute walking test (6MWT).Group A consisted of 17 (26.1%) patients. The systolic (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and PP were, respectively, 125.4 ±11.7, 74.5 ± 9.1 and 50.9 ± 10.0 mmHg in group A and 160.7 ± 19.6, 90.0 ± 12.2 and 70.7 ± 20.2 mmHg in group B. The ABI was significantly lower in group B (0.66 ± 0.12 vs. 0.57 ± 0.13, p <0.05). SBP and PP correlated with LLOAD severity and the distances walked at the 6MWT. Patients with PP > 40 mmHg walked shorter distances.SBP and PP significantly correlated with the distances walked in the 6MWT, suggesting they are clinical markers of functional capacity impairment in patients with symptomatic LLOAD.
