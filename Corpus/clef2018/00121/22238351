Ankle-brachial index and coronary artery lesion complexity in patients with acute coronary syndromes. We investigated the relationship between peripheral artery disease (PAD) and coronary artery disease (CAD) complexity in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Consecutive patients with first time diagnosis of ACS (n = 150) were enrolled. SYNTAX score (SS), a marker of CAD complexity, was assessed by dedicated computer software and diagnosis of PAD was established by ankle-brachial index (ABI) value. SYNTAX score was higher in patients with overt and borderline PAD (ABI ≤ 0.99) than normal participants (ABI 1-1.29 16.7 ± 8.2 vs 10.1 ± 5.5
