Role of cilostazol in the sequential therapeutic spectrum of the  peripheral arterial occlusion disease (PAOD). Cilostazol (Pletal(Â®), UCB Pharma, Monheim, Deutschland) has been successfully established since its inauguration on the German market in 2007, which is associated with a considerable distribution, in particular, in angiologic patients. However, vascularsurgical specifics in the use of Cilostazol are still lacking. The aim of this very compact short overview is (based on a selective literature search and own clinical experiences over the years) to characterize mechanism of action, use and expectable therapeutic effect of Cilostazol in the challenging management of exclusively vascularsurgcial patients with peripheral arterial occlusion disease (PAOD). Cilostazol inhibits phosphodiesterase 3 and platelet aggregation in a reversible manner with a dose-effect association, has vasodilating potential and a positive inotropic effect but provides a selective effect on the platelets, muscle and endothelial cells of the vascular wall via an intracellular increase of cAMP in addition, there is an antiproliferative effect, it promotes neoangiogenesis, inhibits apoptosis and generation of endothelial adhesion molecules - taken together, it can be considered antiatherogenic ("anti-arterioscleroticum"). From a clinical point of view, Cilostazol is indicated in stage IIb of PAOD (Fontaine)
