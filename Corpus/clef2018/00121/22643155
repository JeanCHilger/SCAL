Assessment of cardiovascular risk in primary health care. This study aimed at investigating whether cardiovascular risk factors and their impact on total risk estimation differ between men and women.Cross-sectional cohort study.Finnish cardiovascular risk subjects (n = 904) without established cardiovascular disease, renal disease, or known diabetes.Ankle-brachial index (ABI), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), oral glucose tolerance test, and total cardiovascular risk using SCORE risk charts.According to the SCORE risk charts, 27.0% (95% CI 23.1-31.2) of the women and 63.1% (95% CI 58.3-67.7) of the men (p < 0.001) were classified as high-risk subjects. Of the women classified as low-risk subjects according to SCORE, 25% had either subclinical peripheral arterial disease or renal insufficiency.The SCORE system does not take into account cardiovascular risk factors typical in women, and thus underestimates their total cardiovascular risk. Measurement of ABI and eGFR in primary care might improve cardiovascular risk assessment. especially in women.
