Change in ankle-brachial index over time and mortality in diabetics with proteinuria. Peripheral arterial disease is common in diabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is characterized either by abnormally low or high ankle-brachial index (ABI). Whether low or high ABI carries similar prognostic value is unknown. The association of baseline ABI with all-cause mortality over 40 ± 21 months (mean ± SD) was ascertained in 167 proteinuric diabetics (age 57 ± 7 years median urine protein-creatinine, 2.5 mg/mg). Association of change in ABI with all-cause mortality was determined in 75 subjects with normal ABI (0.9 - 1.3) at baseline. Among 167 participants, 41% had an abnormal ABI: < 0.9, 18%
