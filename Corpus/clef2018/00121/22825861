Ventilatory threshold is related to walking tolerance in patients with intermittent claudication. This study assessed the relationship between lower limb hemodynamics and metabolic parameters with walking tolerance in patients with intermittent claudication (IC).Resting ankle-brachial index (ABI), baseline blood flow (BF), BF response to reactive hyperemia (BFRH), oxygen uptake (VO2), initial claudication distance (ICD) and total walking distance (TWD) were measured in 28 IC patients. Pearson and Spearman correlations were calculated.ABI, baseline BF and BF response to RH did not correlate with ICD or TWD. VO2 at first ventilatory threshold and VO2peak were significantly and positively correlated with ICD (r = 0.41 and 0.54, respectively) and TWD (r = 0.65 and 0.71, respectively).VO2peak and VO2 at first ventilatory threshold, but not ABI, baseline BF and BFHR were associated with walking tolerance in IC patients. These results suggest that VO2 at first ventilatory threshold may be useful to evaluate walking tolerance and improvements in IC patients.
