Early sustained injections of erythropoietin improve angiogenesis and restoration of perfusion in the ischemic mouse hindlimb. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of erythropoietin (Epo) on both acute and chronic limb ischemia (ALI and CLI) and to evaluate the differences in mechanisms according to the method of Epo administration. Hindlimb ischemia was made in BALB/c mice with femoral artery ligation. The mice were divided into four groups: Group 1 (control, no treatment), Group 2 (ALI, early multiple doses), Group 3 (ALI, early single high dose), Group 4 (CLI, late multiple doses). Blood flow ratio significantly increased in Group 2 in 4 weeks. Expression of pAkt and Erythropoietin receptor were significantly higher in Group 2 on postoperative day (POD) 7. The number of CD31- and vascular endothelial growth factor-positive cells were significantly higher in Group 2 on POD 7 and 56. Group 3 and 4 showed a tendency of higher cell counts than the control. The early sustained Epo was effective in improving blood flow through angiogenesis. In chronic phase, weekly multiple dosing of Epo induced angiogenesis, however, the blood flow ratio did not increase significantly. The results of this study suggest that Epo administration during the acute phase followed by maintenance for several days may be important for increasing blood flow and angiogenesis.
