Sudden onset of abdominal distension.... We report the case of a 39 years old patient with sudden onset of abdominal distension and icterus. Occlusion of the liver veins discovered by doppler ultrasound caused the portal hypertension and liver disease. Given the erythrocytosis the detection of JAK 2-mutation proved polycythemia vera as underlying disease for the Budd Chiari syndrome. The implantation of a TIPS wasn't successful because of an early thrombotic occlusion. Therefore a surgical mesocaval shunt was done. At the moment the patient is therapied with oral anticoagulation and hydroxycarbamide and is fully capable of work again.
