Neovascular glaucoma and carotid artery obstructive disease. Carotid artery obstructive disease, although infrequently diagnosed as a primary or contributing cause of neovascular glaucoma, can produce distinctive characteristics. Decreased perfusion of the ciliary body may decrease aqueous humor production. As a result, such eyes with neovascular glaucoma may occasionally be normotensive or even hypotensive. Fluorescein angiography may show an increased arm-to-retina time and leakage from the major retinal arterioles. Panretinal photocoagulation may not eliminate the anterior segment neovascularization because of anterior segment ischemia. Endarterectomy can significantly increase intraocular pressure as perfusion to the ciliary body returns to normal. These characteristics were found in two patients, a 67-year-old woman and a 49-year-old man, with diabetes and hypertension. In both cases cyclocryotherapy significantly reduced the intraocular pressure and the rubeosis iridis regressed.
