Effects of the antihypertensive dilevalol on aortic compliance in anesthetized dogs. The present study examined the actions of dilevalol, an antihypertensive beta-adrenoceptor blocker with arterial vasodilator actions, on aortic compliance (AC) in anesthetized dogs. AC was measured by sonomicrometric determination of the ratio of aortic systolic-diastolic diameters (mm) and arterial pulse pressure (mm Hg). One AC unit (ACU) equals 10(-3) mm/mm Hg. Dilevalol (0.032, 0.1, and 3.2 mg/kg intravenously, i.v.) significantly (p less than .05) increased AC by 1.4 +/- 0.3, 3.7 +/- 1.4, and 4.5 +/- 1.2 ACU from basal values of 4.7 +/- 0.4-5.6 +/- 0.4 ACU while reducing blood pressure by 20 +/- 2, 31 +/- 9, and 41 +/- 10 mm Hg, respectively (p less than 0.05). Increases in AC were not the passive result of altered blood pressure. Proximal mechanical aortic occlusion dropped systolic blood pressure as much as 70 mm Hg without altering AC. Hydralazine also (0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg i.v.) lowered blood pressure significantly (p less than 0.05) by 14 +/- 3 and 40 +/- 4 mm Hg but increased AC only at 1.0 mg/kg (+ 1.6 +/- 0.4 ACU, p less than 0.05). Phenylephrine (1-30 micrograms/kg i.v.) significantly raised blood pressure 25 +/- 3-95 +/- 8 mm Hg but decreased AC significantly by 1.2 +/- 0.3-2.4 +/- 0.3 ACU. Isoproterenol (ISO) (0.01-1.0 micrograms/kg) produced effects on AC similar to those of dilevalol. Propranolol pretreatment attenuated dilevalol and ISO-induced increases in AC. Propranolol (0.32 and 1.0 mg/kg) did not significantly change AC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
