Effects of taprostene, a chemically stable prostacyclin analogue, in patients with ischaemic peripheral vascular disease: a placebo controlled double-blind trial. Thirty patients with ischaemic peripheral vascular disease and intermittent claudication were randomly allocated to receive either placebo or taprostene, a chemically stable prostacyclin analogue, intravenously at a rate of 25 ng/kg/min for 6 hours daily on 5 consecutive days. Taprostene produced a significant (p less than 0.05) increase in absolute walking time compared to placebo on one day after infusion and at 1, 4 and 8 weeks (14% vs 2.8%) later. Taprostene also produced a significant (p less than 0.05) increase in the pain-free walking time compared to placebo in the follow-up period (8 weeks after infusion: 23% vs 3.8%). During the infusion period systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased (p less than 0.05) and heart rate was accelerated (p less than 0.05) in the taprostene treated group whereas no change was monitored in the placebo group. The ankle/brachial Doppler index was unaffected by taprostene. The platelet half-life was significantly (p less than 0.05) prolonged following taprostene-infusion (72.6 +/- 9.35 vs 77.9 +/- 7.44 hours). However, no change on platelet half-life was found in the placebo group (p less than 0.05). Various measures of platelet function parameters followed in vitro (ADP-induced aggregation, platelet sensitivity to PGI2, PGE1, PGD1 and taprostene, concentrations of platelet factor 4 and beta-thromboglobulin) showed no change with taprostene. Measures of circulating platelet aggregates and endothelial cells count showed no changes during the 2 months follow-up period too. It is assumed that taprostene may be of clinical benefit in patients with ischaemic peripheral vascular disease. However, future investigations have to be carried out to assess the optimal dose regime.
