Inability of chronic chemical sympathectomy to induce coronary collateral growth or development: studies in the rat heart in vivo. The influence of chronic chemical sympathectomy on the extent of coronary collateral flow delivered to a zone of regional ischaemia following an acute coronary artery occlusion was examined in the rat. Male rats were randomly assigned to either 6-hydroxydopamine treated or vehicle treated groups (n = 20 in each group). Drug treated animals were injected with 6-hydroxydopamine intravenously as follows: day 1, 10 mg.kg-1 day 2, 50 mg.kg-1
