Coronary circulation in patients with ischemic heart disease with various degrees of arteriosclerosis obliterans of the leg during selection surgical treatment. First in the literature, the relationship between the coronary and lower limb circulation is detailed on the basis of objective findings. Comparison of the two patient groups (the patients categorized according to the degree of lower limb ischemia revealed by Doppler ultrasound echocardiography) in respect to the clinicomorphofunctional characteristics of the coronary flow in IHD patients suggested the absence of a significant correlation between them. Varying severity of lower limb ischemia does not influence the gravity of IHD manifestation in the same patients.
