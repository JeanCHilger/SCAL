Doppler-ophthalmomanometry in patients with obstruction of the carotid arteries. A novel noninvasive method to determine simultaneously ophthalmic artery pressure (OAP) and flow direction based on Doppler ultrasound principles is presented: ophthalmomanometry-Doppler (OMD). Studies performed on 25 angiographically proven normal subjects with direct recording of the internal carotid artery pressure (ICP) and indirect determination of the brachial artery pressure (BAP) demonstrated that OAP values assessed by the OMD device are highly correlated with simultaneous ipsilateral intraarterial systolic ICP measurements (r = 0.95, n = 10) and with simultaneous recordings of the BAP (r = 0.88, n = 15). In 50 patients presenting angiographically occlusions and 52 patients presenting angiographically stenoses (greater than 60%) of the carotid artery the measured Doppler ophthalmic pressure index (OPI = ratio of the ophthalmic to systemic blood pressure) was lower ipsilateral to an occlusion (0.46 +/- 0.08) than ipsilateral to a stenosis (0.54 +/- 0.08 p less than 0.001) of the carotid artery. In both it was clearly diminished compared to normal values (0.68 +/- 0.04
