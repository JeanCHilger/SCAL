Comparison of blood-flow velocity waveforms in different coronary artery bypass grafts. Sequential saphenous vein grafts and internal mammary artery grafts. Characteristics of blood-flow velocities were investigated at different sites in two types of coronary artery bypass grafts, sequential saphenous vein grafts (SSVG) and internal mammary artery grafts (IMAG). The latter appear to have the longest life span. The patency rate of the side-to-side anastomosis of the SSVG is better than that of the end-to-side anastomosis. The SSVG was anastomosed to the major diagonal branch by side-to-side anastomosis and to the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) by end-to-side anastomosis in 13 patients who had 75-100% and 75-90% stenoses in the LAD and major diagonal branch, respectively. IMAG anastomoses were performed to the LAD in 10 patients with 75-100% stenoses of the artery. The blood-flow velocities were measured by the 20-MHz, eighty-channel ultrasound pulsed Doppler method during surgery. In six patients in the SSVG group, we investigated the configuration of velocity profiles at the region just proximal to the side-to-side anastomosis and at the bridge portion between the side-to-side and end-to-side anastomosis. In the other seven patients, we measured the blood-flow velocity at several centimeters proximal to the side-to-side anastomosis and compared it with that in the IMAG. At the region just proximal to the side-to-side anastomosis, the velocity profile skewed toward the anastomosis side wall in all patients, and the flow velocity near the wall opposite to the side-to-side anastomosis was reversed in five of six patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
