Duplex Doppler scanning in the pelvis and abdomen. New Doppler applications of Doppler ultrasound are becoming apparent in the abdomen and pelvis. Interpretation of the Doppler signals may be qualitative, semiqualitative or quantitative. Normal time-velocity spectra in major vessels of the abdomen and pelvis are described. In the diagnosis in pathology, Doppler can be used to document the presence and direction of flow in the portal venous system. In can aid in the identification of an abnormal structure. It provides much of the perfusion data required before and subsequent to liver transplantation. In normotopic renal vessels, it can exclude thrombosis and stenoses in many patients. In renal transplants, it is invaluable as a rapid means to assess patency, renal artery stenosis and vascular rejection, thereby extending the role of conventional imaging. Early studies in the pelvis have demonstrated changes in the ovarian signals associated with ovulation. Doppler can be used to assess bowel viability, impotence due to vascular insufficiency and to exclude testicular torsion. Finally, blood flow in malignant tumors has been demonstrated to give rise to Doppler signals with characteristic qualities, and this technique awaits thorough investigation in the abdomen.
