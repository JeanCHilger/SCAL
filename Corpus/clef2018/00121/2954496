A new method for the quantitative assessment of arterial insufficiency of the limbs: cutaneous postischemic hyperemia test by laser Doppler. The cutaneous postischemic hyperemia test, by means of laser Doppler flowmetry, was carried out on 71 normal, healthy lower extremities and 138 lower limbs suffering from peripheral occlusive arterial disease. The test, a new technique for evaluating the hemodynamics of limbs, permitted a clear distinction between normal, healthy subjects and patients suffering from arterial disorders. It was also seen that the degree of deterioration in the quantitative parameters was quite obviously related to the seriousness of the clinical picture. A comparison of the more severely and less severely affected limbs of each patient and the values taken bilaterally gave a correspondence of 98.6%. A therapeutic cycle consisting of the intraarterial administration of naftidrofuryl in 20 limbs achieved a statistically significant improvement in two parameters (tL and tR). Four limbs were treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. After treatment the values obtained with the test were found to be absolutely normal. It is therefore suggested that this test be widely adopted in vascular diagnostic laboratories.
