The rabbit ear pedicle flap. A new model for evaluating factors affecting the circulation in flaps. Laser Doppler flowmetry and transcutaneous oximetry were compared regarding their speed and accuracy in detecting occlusion of the artery of an experimental rabbit ear pedicle flap. The laser Doppler flowmeter showed a significant decrease in flow and the transcutaneous oximeter showed a significant decrease in oxygen tension within one minute after occlusion of the artery. A significant increase in flow was observed within one minute, and a significant increase in oxygen tension readings was observed one minute after the artery was opened. A steady state after opening the artery was reached sooner for the laser Doppler flowmeter readings. This study suggests that laser Doppler flowmetry and transcutaneous oximetry are equally fast and accurate in detecting changes in blood flow to a pedicle graft. These methods also have equally good reproducibility. Repeated clampings within a 30 min period did not affect the measured parameters.
