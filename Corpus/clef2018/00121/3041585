The value of ultrasound Doppler pulse curve parameters in the assessment of stenotic arterial diseases. By means of a biophysical model of the pulse wave propagation in arterial vessels the impact of haemodynamic changes on the Doppler pulse curve was studied. The variation of the haemodynamic parameters of the model gives information about the diagnostic meaning of the pulse curve parameters in respect of stenotic alterations.
