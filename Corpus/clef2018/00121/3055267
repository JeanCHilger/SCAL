Deep venous thrombosis of the upper extremities. Deep vein thrombosis of the upper extremity is rare. While its pathogenesis is not always evident, it often occurs in connection with tumors, thoracic outlet syndrome or intravenous catheter therapy. Acute thrombosis of the subclavian vein usually is a clinical diagnosis, but in doubtful cases diagnostic tests such as Doppler ultrasound and/or plethysmography may be useful. If necessary, verification of subclavian vein thrombosis can be done by phlebography. Considering the incidence of thromboembolic complications such as pulmonary embolism, anticoagulation is indicated in all cases of acute thrombosis. Under standard conservative treatment residual symptoms following the venous occlusion are few and the prognosis is favorable. Therefore, invasive treatment such as thrombectomy or thrombolysis should be considered only in special cases.
