A comparative study and assessment of Doppler ultrasound spectral estimation techniques. Part I: Estimation methods. When compared to the classical Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) or Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) approach, modern estimation methods offer the potential for achieving significant improvements in estimating the power density spectrum of Doppler ultrasound signals. Such improvements, for example, might enable minor flow disturbances to be detected, thereby improving the sensitivity in arterial disease assessment. Specifically, reduction in the variance and bias can be achieved, and this may enable disturbed flow to be detected in a more sensitive manner. The approach taken here, is to consider spectral estimation methods as a problem of fitting an assumed model to the Doppler signal. The models described assume that the signal is stationary. Since the Doppler signal is generally nonstationary, it is assumed that a short enough time window interval can be chosen over which the signal can be considered stationary. We shall review the various methods and when appropriate, relate them to the nature of the Doppler signal.
