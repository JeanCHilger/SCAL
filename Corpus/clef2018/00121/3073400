Evaluation of capillary permeability and microcirculation in patients with chronic venous hypertension treated with venoruton by the vacuum suction chamber (VSC) device and laser-Doppler flowmetry. A new system to study capillary permeability, the VSC (vacuum suction chamber) device has been developed to evaluate the variations of capillary permeability in postphlebitic limbs. The VSC device produces by negative pressure [obtained in a plastic chamber applied to the skin at the perimalleolar region] a wheal which disappears in normals in less than one hour. In twelve patients with moderate [superficial] venous hypertension and in twelve patients with postphlebitic limbs the time of disappearance of the wheals was significantly longer in comparison with ten normal limbs. There was also a significantly increased time of disappearance of the wheals in postphlebitic legs in comparison with those with superficial incompetence. The validation of the VSC technique with venous occlusion plethysmography (VOP) showed that the increase of time of disappearance of the wheals is well correlated with the increase of capillary permeability demonstrated by VOP. After 2 weeks treatment with Venoruton (at the dosage of 1000 mg t.i.d.) the time of disappearance of the wheal was significantly reduced in both groups of patients (while it was unchanged in normals). Laser-Doppler parameters used together with the VSC device to evaluate the microcirculatory changes associated with an altered capillary permeability also showed a significant improvement of the laser-Doppler parameters after treatment. In conclusion there is evidence by the VSC device that capillary permeability [which is abnormally increased] in chronic venous hypertension is improved [decreased] after treatment for two weeks with Venoruton. This study demonstrated also the efficacy of the VSC device to study capillary permeability and the effects of drugs active on capillary permeability.
