Reverse flow in the major infrarenal vessels--a capacitive phenomenon. The arterial blood flow waveform is shown to change abruptly when passing from the thoracic aorta into the abdominal aorta in humans. Although this change has been accurately predicted by numerical solution of complicated pulse propagation equations, this paper demonstrates the ability of a simple lumped parameter model to explain this change in the waveforms using easily understood physical terms. The model correctly predicts changes in flow waveform under conditions of exercise and peripheral vascular disease. This analysis is useful in understanding abdominal artery physiology and explains the basis for clinical ultrasound Doppler examination of the legs.
