Effects of atherosclerotic lesions on ultrasonic beam and CW Doppler signals. Doppler ultrasound has been shown to be a useful clinical tool in the noninvasive detection of vascular stenoses, occlusion, or plaques. The presence of atherosclerotic lesions in blood vessel walls can distort the Doppler ultrasonic signal, producing inverted or biphasic tracings. This observation, in fact, has been used frequently as a criterion for the diagnosis of plaque formation and calcification of these lesions. To define the source of this distortion, we have examined the effects of various types of atherosclerotic lesions on the transmitted ultrasonic beam generated by a continuous wave (CW) Doppler ultrasonic probe. These results are compared to the Doppler flow tracings obtained by a CW ultrasonic Doppler flowmeter from blood vessels with overlaying lesions in a mock flow system. It is concluded that severe distortion in the form of beam refraction or diffraction can be produced by calcified lesions, resulting in biphasic or inverted flow signals.
