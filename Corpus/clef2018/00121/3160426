The value of perioperative Doppler ankle systolic pressure measurements in reconstructive arterial surgery. This study evaluates the use of ankle systolic Doppler indices for the detection of technical errors during reconstructive surgery. Measurements taken peroperatively, following declamping, are expressed as a ratio of brachial systolic pressure and compared with preoperative and postoperative readings. A study has been made of 377 limbs in 272 patients, including patients undergoing surgery for aneurysm, claudication and limb salvage. In the majority of patients the peroperative ratios were similar to, or improved on, pre-operative levels. No technical errors or primary failures were apparent in those patients in which this was the case. In contrast, in the 27 limbs in which a pre-operative ratio had been measurable, but no peroperative signal obtained, 21 technical errors were identified and corrected immediately. There were 16 limbs with severe ischaemia, and neither pre-operative nor peroperative signals, in which the outcome was less certain. In ten, major amputation subsequently became necessary because of inadequate run-off which was demonstrated radiologically. Finally, there were four limbs in which failure occurred postoperatively in spite of a restored peroperative signal. It is concluded that this simple technique is useful and sensitive.
