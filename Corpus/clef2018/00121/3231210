A clinical study of extended profundaplasty for severely ischemic limbs. Between January 1986 October 1987, extended profundaplasty was performed on 11 severely ischemic limbs of eight patients with extended arteriosclerotic occlusions, associated with surgery for improvement in inflow. The subjects were all males, and ages ranged from 62 to 84 years (mean: 72.8 years). Symptoms were disabling claudication in one limb (1 case), rest pain in 5 (4 cases), and gangrene of the foot or ulcer of the toes in 5 (3 cases). Preoperative ankle pressure index (API) was 0 in 7 limbs (5 cases), and between 0.11 and 0.27 in the remaining 4 limbs (3 cases). Thrombectomy was performed in two cases, axillo-bifemoral bypass in 5, femoro-femoral bypass in one, and aorto-bifemoral bypass in one, as surgery for improvement in inflow. Although postoperative API remained 0 in 4 limbs, it increased between 0.36 and 0.56 in the remaining limbs. One subject died of heart failure on the 22nd postoperative day, and two limbs required below-knee amputation. Limb salvage rate was 81.8%. Extended profundaplasty seems to be a worthwhile choice of treatment as a limb salvage operation for severely ischemic limbs due to extended arteriosclerotic occlusions involving not only aorto-iliac but also femoro-popliteal or crural segment.
