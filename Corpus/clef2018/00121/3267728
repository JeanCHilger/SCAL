Analysis of digital subtraction angiography for estimating flow reserve in critical coronary artery stenosis. To assess the accuracy of digital subtraction angiography in evaluating coronary flow reserve in cases with critical coronary artery stenosis, time-density curves were obtained from digital subtraction coronary angiograms in the myocardial region of interest. Time to peak contrast (TPC) and time constant of the washout exponential curve (T) were measured in 14 patients with stable effort angina pectoris and critical one vessel lesion before and after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). All patients had normal left ventricular ejection fraction (59 +/- 7%) and 201T1 myocardial images at rest. The values of TPC and T were significantly shortened from 5.4 +/- 1.3 to 4.5 +/- 1.0 sec (p less than 0.02) and from 10.9 +/- 3.8 to 5.3 +/- 1.3 sec (p less than 0.001) after PTCA, respectively. However, in 9 patients TPC values were approximately the same before and after PTCA. In five experimental dogs with critical circumflex coronary artery stenosis, coronary flow (CF Doppler flowmeter) and systolic thickening of the posterior wall (by sonomicrometry) at rest did not differ from those of the controls. However, contrast media-induced reactive hyperemia was markedly attenuated, accompanied by a significant increase in T (7.7 +/- 4.5 vs 15.8 +/- 10.9 sec, p less than 0.01) and totally unchanged TPC (both 6.8 sec). With simultaneous tracings of CF and time-density curves, TPC and washout phases corresponded with contrast-induced transient CF reduction and hyperemic phases, respectively. We concluded that T may be more sensitive for estimating CF maintained nearly normal, e.g., in patients with stable effort angina pectoris having normal left ventricular wall motion at rest.
