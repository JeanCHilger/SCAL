An implanted ultrasound Doppler probe for microvascular monitoring: an experimental study. An experimental investigation is presented into the use of pulsed ultrasound Doppler flowmetry with a percutaneously implanted probe as a monitor of microvascular anastomotic patency. The method accurately indicated and distinguished between experimental arterial and venous occlusion in epigastric island flaps. In free flaps it had advantages over manipulative, intraoperative tests of anastomotic patency and was a reliable post-operative monitor of flap circulation in the experimental model. The technique appears to have great potential as a post-operative monitor for free flaps, including those without a visible surface.
