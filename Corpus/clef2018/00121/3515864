The effects of acebutolol and metoprolol on walking distances and distal blood pressure in hypertensive patients with intermittent claudication. The effects of acebutolol (with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA] and metoprolol (without ISA) on arm blood pressure, ankle systolic blood pressure, claudication distances (CD) and maximal walking distances (MWD) were compared in patients with essential hypertension and intermittent claudication. Fourteen patients participated in a long-term, open, randomized cross-over study. After randomization the patients received either acebutolol, 200 mg b.i.d., or metoprolol, 100 mg b.i.d. After eight weeks the drugs were shifted and after another eight weeks they were withdrawn. Arm and ankle blood pressure, CD and MWD were determined before randomization and after 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks, and again 4-6 weeks after withdrawal of the drugs. The arm blood pressure was reduced by 20/13 mmHg after acebutolol and by 22/21 mmHg after metoprolol. In spite of a significant decrease in arm blood pressure there were no significant changes in ankle blood pressure, CD or MWD after the two drugs. After withdrawal of the drugs and after the arm blood pressure had returned to the control value no significant changes were seen in CD, MWD or ankle blood pressure. It is concluded that beta-blockers have no deleterious effect on CD, MWD or ankle blood pressure in patients with hypertension and intermittent claudication. No effect of ISA was demonstrated.
