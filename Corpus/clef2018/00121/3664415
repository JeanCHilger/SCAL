A single treadmill exercise test does not accurately quantitate claudication. The diagnosis of vascular occlusive disease is confirmed by documenting a fall in the ankle-brachial pressure index following a treadmill exercise test. The authors hypothesize that this test does not provide a reproducible quantitative assessment of the patient's disability due to the disease. In 25 patients a series of five treadmill exercise tests were performed on the same day. There was a significant (p less than 0.05) increase in the time to the occurrence of claudication when tests 3, 4 and 5 were compared with test 1. There was also a significant (p less than 0.05) rise in the maximum time walked comparing test 3 with test 1. There was no difference in the fall in ankle-brachial pressure index with each test. The majority of patients had achieved their maximum walking distance by test no. 3. It is concluded that a single treadmill exercise test will not accurately assess disability due to intermittent claudication and it is recommended that three tests be performed for a reproducible evaluation.
