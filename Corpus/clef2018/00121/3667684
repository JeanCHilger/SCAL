Tibial artery autogenous in situ vein bypass with adjunctive arteriovenous fistula. A man suffering from severe intermittent claudication of the right calf and foot was successfully treated by femoro-tibio-peroneal trunk autogenous vein bypass with adjunctive arteriovenous fistula. Prior to operation, he was unable to walk more than 50 meters without resting. Preoperative arteriography revealed extensive occlusion of the popliteotibial arteries, except for indistinct visualization of the tibio-peroneal trunk, in which conventional reconstructive surgery seemed not to be feasible because of poor distal run-off. An autogenous vein bypass graft between the distal superficial femoral artery and tibio-peroneal trunk was successfully made "in-situ", creating an adjunctive arteriovenous fistula. Postoperatively, the ankle pressure index of the posterior tibial artery was considerably increased from 0 to 0.65, and Doppler flow wave could be recorded. The patient can now walk more than 1,500 meters without resting.
