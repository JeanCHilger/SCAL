Effect of cutaneous hypoxia upon erythema and pigment responses to UVA, UVB, and PUVA (8-MOP + UVA) in human skin. The effect of oxygen deprivation upon UVA-, UVB-, and PUVA-induced pigment and erythema responses in normal human skin was examined. Before exposure, varying degrees of hypoxia in the skin of the forearm were achieved by inflating a sphygmomanometer cuff applied to the upper arm. After the transcutaneously measured pO2 had stabilized, sites on the inner forearm were exposed to UVA, UVB, or 8-MOP + UVA radiation, to determine dose thresholds for the induction of erythema and pigmentation at different cuff pressures. Inflation of the cuff to greater than systolic pressure completely inhibited immediate and delayed pigment responses (IPD, DT) to UVA doses greater than 10 times the normal pigmentation threshold dose. UVA-induced delayed erythema responses were partially inhibited by cuff inflation: 2.7 times the minimal erythema dose of UVA was necessary to cause an erythema response when exposure occurred during vascular occlusion. In contrast, erythema and pigment responses to UVB and PUVA were unaltered by cuff pressures exceeding systolic pressure during exposure. Inhibition of UVA-induced erythema and pigment responses by vascular occlusion were reversed by the transcutaneous diffusion of 100% O2. These findings indicate that the cutaneous responses to UVA and UVB occur by separate pathways differing with respect to O2 dependence. Our findings agree with those of other studies which indicate that PUVA-induced phototoxicity and melanogenesis are not O2-dependent.
