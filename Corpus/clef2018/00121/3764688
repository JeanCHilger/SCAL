Thoracic aorta as source of inflow in reoperation for occluded aortoiliac reconstruction. We reviewed our experience with reoperations for recurrent obstruction occurring after aortoiliac or aortofemoral reconstruction. Patients who underwent successful transfemoral thrombectomy of the aortofemoral graft or femorofemoral crossover graft were excluded from the study. A more proximal source of inflow to revascularize the ischemic limbs was required in the remaining 35 patients. Bilateral reconstruction was performed in 22 patients. Operative indication was rest pain or necrosis in 36 limbs and severe claudication in 21 limbs. Preoperative ankle/brachial pressure index (API) ranged from 0.05 to 0.61. Thirteen patients (21 limbs, group I) underwent transabdominal reoperation. Since the transabdominal approach was considered hazardous because of multiple previous operations, the remaining patients underwent retroperitoneal descending thoracic aorta-femoral artery bypass (15 patients, 25 limbs group II) or axillofemoral bypass graft (7 patients, 11 limbs
