Effect of training on the post-exercise ankle blood pressure reaction in patients with intermittent claudication. The effect of physical training on the post-exercise blood pressure reaction in the ankle was studied in 63 patients with intermittent claudication but without angina pectoris. After three months of supervised training the maximal walking distance increased by 67% and the pain-free walking distance by 73%. Compared with that after the pre-training treadmill test, the ankle blood pressure was significantly higher 2-16 min after the post-training test and more rapidly returned to the initial resting value, both with similar work loads and with a higher post-training work load. Blood pressure measurement in the ankle after exercise is useful as an objective test of the circulatory effect of training in patients with intermittent claudication.
