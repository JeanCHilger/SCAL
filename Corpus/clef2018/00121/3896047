The reliability of Doppler ultrasound techniques in the assessment of carotid disease. The reliability of continuous wave (CW) Doppler imaging and Duplex scanning in the assessment of carotid artery disease has been evaluated prospectively in comparison with biplanar angiography. Of 130 comparisons the sensitivity of Doppler imaging was 89% and specificity 99% in the detection of greater than or equal to 50% internal carotid stenosis, and 87% and 99% respectively in the diagnosis of internal carotid occlusion. Of 118 comparisons the sensitivity of Duplex scanning was 93% and specificity 98% in the detection of greater than or equal to 50% internal carotid stenosis, and 93% and 99% respectively in the diagnosis of internal carotid occlusion. CW Doppler imaging and Duplex scanning are accurate techniques in the diagnosis and categorisation of internal carotid artery disease. CW Doppler imaging is an effective screening technique for the presence of greater than or equal to 50% internal carotid artery stenosis. Duplex scanning also has the potential for improved detection of early internal carotid artery disease and study of the natural history of atherosclerosis.
