Comparative assessment of blood flow to canine island flaps. Fluorometric quantification of dye delivery, laser Doppler flowmetry, and transcutaneous measurement of tissue oxygen level were evaluated in canine island flaps subjected to vascular occlusion. Each technique readily identified the clamping insult. Relative fluorescein delivery to the flap (compared with a reference area) decreased from 66% before clamping to almost zero during clamping. Laser Doppler readings rapidly declined from an average of 230 to an average of 31 mV. Oxygen readings rapidly declined from 57 to 1 mm Hg. Laser Doppler flowmetry and transcutaneous oxygen monitoring seem best suited for continuous monitoring of trends at a single site. Fluorometry is more precise and can be used to monitor multiple sites. One should weigh the benefits of this technique against the need for dye injection.
