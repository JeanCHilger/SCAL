The value of noninvasive investigation in the diagnosis of total occlusion of the internal carotid artery. A battery of simple noninvasive tests consisting of directional Doppler ultrasound and carotid phonoangiography has been used to detect carotid stenosis in 700 patients Forty four carotid occlusions in 42 patients were confirmed on angiography, and this study examines the accuracy of this noninvasive battery in predicting the presence of an occluded internal carotid artery. Although the sensitivity of the battery described has been 70% for occlusion, with a specificity of 98% (only five false positives), this relatively low sensitivity and the uniform requirement for surgery in the false positive group have led us to conclude that this battery should not be used as a substitute for angiography when the diagnosis of internal carotid occlusion requires to be confirmed. Nevertheless, these noninvasive tests do have a role in alerting the physician to the presence of carotid occlusion and contralateral carotid artery stenosis, allowing more specific planning of any subsequent arteriography required.
