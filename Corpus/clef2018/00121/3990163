Pathogenesis and clinical significance of Mönckeberg medial calcinosis. Medial calcinosis of Mönckeberg is frequently observed in peripheral arteries of diabetics with neuropathy. The cause of this vessel alteration is unknown and the clinical significance has been questioned. Six to eight years after uni- or bilateral lumbar sympathectomy 60 patients were investigated radiologically for medial calcinosis of foot arteries. Of 60 patients, 55 had Mönckeberg's sclerosis. In 93% of the patients who had undergone bilateral operation medial calcification was seen in both feet. After unilateral sympathectomy the incidence of medial calcinosis on the operated side was significantly higher than on the non-operated side (88% versus 18%, p less than 0.01). There was no significant difference between diabetics and non-diabetics. These findings suggest that medial calcification is related to autonomic neuropathy of peripheral vessels. Fifty-two of 160 patients (32.5%) with severe arterial occlusive disease of the lower limbs showed medial calcification of foot arteries. Mönckeberg's sclerosis was significantly associated with the peripheral type of vascular disease (p less than 0.025). Two groups of patients with the same stage of occlusive vascular disease but without (group A) and with (group B) medial calcification were examined by Doppler ultrasound. In group A the mean ankle pressure (pD) was 51 mm Hg lower than the Riva-Rocci pressure (pRR). In spite of the severe ischemia mean pD in group B exceeded pRR by 14 mm Hg. Of the patients of group B 63% had a pD-pRR value greater than or equal to 0 mm Hg. In group A no positive difference pD-pRR could be shown.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
