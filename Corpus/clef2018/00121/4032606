Reproducibility of noninvasive tests of peripheral occlusive arterial disease. We studied the reproducibility of four tests of peripheral occlusive arterial disease in 54 subjects, 32 of whom had this disease. We found that the reproducibility of systolic blood pressures obtained at rest from the thighs, calves, and ankles approximated that of arm systolic and diastolic blood pressures, as did the ankle-to-arm systolic blood pressure ratios. The average of the tenth and ninetieth percentile ranges of the resting systolic blood pressure ankle-to-arm ratios was +/- 0.10. Systolic blood pressures from the fingers were somewhat less reproducible, and those from the toes were even more variable. Systolic blood pressure ankle-to-arm ratios measured after the patient had exercised were less reproducible than resting ratios. The average of the tenth and ninetieth percentile ranges of the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-minute ratios after exercise was -0.13 to +0.16. Skin temperatures from the fingers and toes were approximately as reproducible as systolic blood pressures from the arms and legs and as the resting ankle-to-arm blood pressure ratios. Pulse-volume recordings from the thighs, calves, ankles, feet, toes, and fingers were very poorly reproducible. We conclude that information on the reproducibility of these measurements is essential in the evaluation of noninvasive arterial tests that are used to determine the course of peripheral occlusive arterial disease.
