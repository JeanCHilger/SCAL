Simultaneous measurement of indirect (Doppler-ultrasonic-technique) and direct arterial systolic blood pressure of the human radial artery (author's transl). At 28 subjects without arterial occlusive disease, the systolic blood pressure of the radial artery was recorded simultaneously by means of the Doppler Ultrasonic Auscultatory Method (Doppler Ultrasonic Wall Motion Technique) and by intraarterial needle and strain-gauge manometer, and the results were compared. In the overall collective the mean values of the systolic pressure were nearly identical (139.6 and 139.7 mm Hg). This applies also to the standard deviation (+/- 19,9 and +/- 19,4). The correlation coefficient was 0.90. These results point to the validity of the indirect measurement of the peripheral systolic pressure by means of the Ultrasonic Doppler Technique. However, there must be taken into consideration that in a particular case there can arise a larger deviation at normal arteria. Possibilities of technical errors at the blood pressure recorded by intraarterial needle and strain-gauge manometer as well as on determining the blood pressure with compression method will be considered. It is concluded that Doppler Method provides a sensitive and accurate noninvasive approach for measurement of peripheral systolic arterial pressure.
