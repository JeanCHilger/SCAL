The effect of withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blockade on intermittent claudication. Twenty-eight patients with intermittent claudication were studied before and one month after withdrawal of treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking drugs for hypertension, coronary heart disease or both. Heart rate, blood pressure, ankle/arm systolic blood pressure ratio and ankle pulse volume recording (PVR) at rest and after treadmill exercise were recorded, as well as walking distance, time of recovery from subjective symptoms, restitution time of pressure ratio and PVR. A control group of 14 patients, whose beta-adrenergic blocking drugs were not withdrawn, was also included. The result can be summarized as showing that withdrawal of beta-blockade was not demonstrably advantageous in patients with intermittent claudication. Significant improvement was observed only during the first month of the trial, a change which was independent of withdrawal of beta-blockade. The relief of subjective symptoms after exercise occurred significantly faster after withdrawal of nonselective beta-blockade. Otherwise, there was no difference between nonselective and cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocking drugs.
