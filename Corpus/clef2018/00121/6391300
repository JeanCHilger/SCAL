Spectral analysis of Doppler flow velocity signals: assessment of objectives, methods, and interpretation. The objective of this paper is to review the theoretical basis and clinical application of electrical impedance plethysmography in the noninvasive evaluation of peripheral arterial and venous disease. Theoretical, experimental and clinical studies have not demonstrated a direct relationship between electrical impedance changes and limb volume changes. Potential sources of error have also been identified. This has led to the development of clinical tests based on impedance plethysmography for the detection of peripheral arterial disease, venous insufficiency and venous outflow obstruction. Impedance plethysmography, using the method of venous occlusion, is presently the most commonly employed noninvasive method for the detection of deep venous thrombosis.
