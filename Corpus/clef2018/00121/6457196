Ultrasonic flow wave pattern as a prognostic indicator in peripheral arterial reconstruction. A prognostic flowmetric study on 80 reconstructed arteries of the lower extremity was carried out to assess the flow wave patterns detected using a bidirectional doppler flowmeter. In 21 of 80 arteries, changes in the flow wave pattern were noted. For 10 of 21 affected arteries, an immediate arteriography revealed localized stenotic lesions at the distal anastomosis, in a short segment of the implanted autogenous vein graft or at the proximal host artery. Immediate repairs for the lesions were successfully performed by a minor surgery in 8 of 10 cases and the flow wave pattern reverted to normal. Two were not successful as the occlusion was complete before attempting the repair. The remaining 11 are now under conservative management as these patients refused further surgery. The ultrasonically driven flow wave pattern proved to be a useful indicator to assess the patency of the reconstructed peripheral artery to detect possible stenosis and thereby to take proper corrective measures and hence prevent a late occlusion.
