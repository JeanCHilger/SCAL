The diagnosis intermittent claudication. The value of walking test, ankle pressure index and calf plethysmography in relation to the clinical findings. Three hundred and forty-nine patients with the diagnosis intermittent claudication (IC) based on Rose's questionnaire were all found to have clinical abnormality based on pulse palpation, and/or auscultation in lower abdomen and groin. The diagnosis was in the majority of cases (87-95%) confirmed by standardized walking test (WT), ankle pressure index (AI) and venous occlusion calf plethysmography (VOP). In clinical abnormality based on bruit only in groin, AI and VOP confirmed the diagnosis less frequently than in the other clinical abnormalities (p less than 0.01).
