Effect of a 3-month-interval running exercise in combination with vasodilative therapy on microcirculation of the lower leg in peripheral arterial circulation disorders (stage I and II). The authors report results of a three-month-interval running exercise under continuous vasodilatory therapy (Radecol and Jupal) in cases of peripheral arterial blood disturbances (stage I and II). Apart from control examination with the whipping test, the ultra-sound-Doppler method, phlebemphraxis-plethysmography, the paper reports above all the effects of interval running on the peripheral microcirculation of the working muscles which were determined by means of Xenon-133-clearance-half-life. Independent of the type of drug therapy used, significant (1 per cent) improvements of peripheral haemodynamics were found regarding the therapeutic regime presented.
