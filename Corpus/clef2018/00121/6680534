Diabetic amputees in Singapore. We studied the clinical features of 262 consecutive patients who had 289 limb amputations in the University Department of Orthopaedics, Singapore General Hospital from January, 1978 to June, 1980. Of these, 171 (59.2%) were done for diabetic complications, 43 (14.9%) for trauma and 27 (9.3%) for atherosclerosis. The mean age of the three groups were 65 +/- 10 (S.D.), 32 +/- 17, and 75 +/- 8 years respectively. The indications for amputation in diabetics were gangrene (36%), ulcer (25%), infection (14%), gangrene and ulcer (11%), gangrene and infection (8.2%), and ulcer and infection (6%). The majority of diabetics were treated with oral agents (80.2%) and diet (6.4%), with 13.4% on insulin. Most patients had their diabetes for less than ten years-38.6% less than five years and 30.7% six-ten years. The mean known duration of the lesion was 1.13 +/- 1.42 months, with 38.7% less than one week. To determine the prevalence of peripheral vascular disease in diabetics admitted for amputation, the ankle/arm systolic BP ratio at rest and post-exercise were determined. In the affected leg, 16/19 patients had decreased ankle/arm systolic BP ratio. In another study, 23/26 diabetic amputees had decreased ankle/arm systolic BP ratio in the remaining leg. These data suggest that diabetes is the most common indication for amputation in this study. Most of these patients are Type II diabetics and have peripheral vascular disease.
