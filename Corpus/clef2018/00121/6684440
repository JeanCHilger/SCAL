Microhaemorheological properties of binifibrate. Part II: Preliminary open studies in patients with peripheral arteriopathies. 3-Pyridinecarboxylic acid 2-[2-(4-chlorophenoxy)-2-methyl-1-oxo-propoxy]-1,3-propanediyl ester (binifibrate, Biniwas) an anti-arteriosclerotic and hypolipidaemic agent which showed an effect on microhaemorheological properties during studies in experimental animals (rat and rabbit), was administered to six hyperlipidaemic patients who suffered from circulatory disturbances in the lower limbs. The treatment with binifibrate was applied at a dosage of 3 X 600 mg/day during one month. Both subjective symptoms such as paraesthesia, dysthaesia, coldness at rest and functional weakness of movements were improved, as well as objective symptoms measured by oscillometry. The microhaemorheological analyses demonstrated a positive variation in relative parameters. The correlation between microhaemorheological parameters and clinical symptoms is discussed.
