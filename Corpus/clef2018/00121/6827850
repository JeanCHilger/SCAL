Noninvasive screening for asymptomatic carotid artery disease prior to cardiac operation. Experience with 500 patients. Five hundred patients scheduled for cardiac operations underwent preoperative screening for asymptomatic carotid artery disease by means of the Gee ocular pneumoplethysmograph (OPG). Only patients with abnormal OPG measurements (5 mm Hg difference or greater in ophthalmic artery pressures or 0.69 or less ophthalmic artery/brachial artery pressure ratio) had cerebral angiography regardless of the presence or absence of a carotid bruit. Thirty-two patients (6.4%) were found to have carotid bruits. Nine patients had abnormal OPG measurements. Cerebral angiograms disclosed that six of these patients had significant (greater than 50%) carotid artery stenosis, and endarterectomy was performed prior to cardiac operation without incident. Nine other patients without carotid bruits had abnormal OPG measurements, and they also underwent cerebral angiography. Angiograms revealed significant carotid artery stenosis in three patients and prophylactic endarterectomy was performed. Twenty-three patients with carotid artery bruits and normal OPG measurements did not have cerebral angiography prior to the cardiac procedure. The incidence of stroke in this series of 500 patients was 0.4% (two patients). The clinical management of patients with asymptomatic carotid artery disease and coronary artery disease was facilitated by the use of noninvasive screening for the evaluation of carotid artery bruits. Patients with hemodynamically insignificant carotid disease, verified by OPG measurements, can be spared the risk and cost of cerebral angiography. Patients without clinical signs of carotid artery disease can also be identified.
