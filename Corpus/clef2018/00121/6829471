Measurement of systemic and pulmonary blood flow and QP/QS ratio using Doppler and two-dimensional echocardiography. A noninvasive method for measuring systemic and pulmonary blood flow using Doppler velocimetry combined with 2-dimensional (2-D) echocardiography has been developed. High correlations were found between Fick- and Doppler-derived indexed measurements of systemic and pulmonary flow as well as the pulmonary to systemic flow ratio in 33 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization (systemic flow [n = 28], r = 0.78 pulmonary flow [n = 21], r = 0.88
