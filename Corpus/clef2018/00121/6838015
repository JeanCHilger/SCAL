Measurement of blood pressure, blood flow and flow velocity in arterial reconstruction of the lower extremity. Seventy-five limbs of 66 patients undergoing arterial reconstruction of the lower extremity were studied. In 41 of 64 limbs that were not involved in early failure, API returned to normal immediately and the increased API was maintained as long as grafts remained patent. The limbs exhibiting a rise in API of 0.1 or more following proximal reconstruction in the cases with combined iliac and femoral arterial occlusion or bypass grafting to an isolated segment obtained marked improvement of symptoms. Postoperative increase in TPI was not so marked as in API, and TPI remained very low in the limbs with arterial obstructive lesions below the ankle after successful reconstruction. Early or late failure could not be predicted on the basis of preoperative or postoperative API, TPI or A-T gradient. In the limbs with no recovery of TPI, blood flow or flow velocity in the foot was of value predicting which limbs would be salvaged.
