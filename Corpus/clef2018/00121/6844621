Duplex ultrasound scanning of the carotid arteries with velocity spectrum analysis. Duplex ultrasound examination of the carotid arteries using high-resolution realtime imaging and pulsed Doppler flow measurements with velocity spectrum analysis was performed on a series of 50 consecutive patients (100 vessels), and findings were compared with findings of conventional carotid arteriography. The criteria for an abnormal duplex examination included: a velocity ratio of 1.5 or more (ratio of the maximum internal carotid artery [ICA] flow velocity to the maximum common carotid artery flow velocity) turbulence, as indicated by an ICA velocity spectral width of 40 cm per second or more
