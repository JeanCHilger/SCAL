Effect of meclofenamate on renal vascular resistance in early Goldblatt hypertension in conscious and anesthetized dog. Blood pressure and renal blood flow were monitored in conscious normotensive (N) and 2-kidney Goldblatt hypertensive (H) dogs. Plasma renin activity was signficantly increased 4--8 days after partial renal artery occlusion. At this time intravenous administration of meclofenamate, 5 mg/kg, had no effect on blood pressure in the N or H or on renal vascular resistance in the N or in the H (contralateral kidney). The renal vasoconstrictor response to angiotensin II was increased in duration by meclofenamate in both the N and H. In contrast to the absence of an effect of meclofenamate on renal vascular resistance in the conscious dog, the synthesis inhibitor caused a consistent increase in RVR in the N and H when they were anesthetized in the terminal experiment. These results suggest the lack of an influence of prostaglandins on renal vascular resistance in the unaffected kidney in Goldblatt hypertension.
