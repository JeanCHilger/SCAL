Cyclic sequential compression of the lower limb in prevention of deep venous thrombosis. Patients undergoing operations on the hip for either replacement or fracture were chosen for this study. Fifty-two subjects received cyclic sequential compression as well as elevation of the lower limb while another fifty-two patients were treated with only elevation of the lower limb. No other method of prophylaxis for deep venous thrombosis was employed during the study period. Support stockings were used after removal of the compression device. Doppler ultrasound, phleborheography, and, when possible, radioiodinated fibrinogen scanning were used for identification and location of thrombi. A deep-vein thrombosis developed in ten patients (19 per cent) in the control group and in only one patient (2 per cent) in the group that was treated with compression. This difference is statistically significant (p less than 0.05).
