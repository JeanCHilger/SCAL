Factors having an effect on Doppler-sonographic blood pressure determinations and their clinical significance. In indirect measurements of the blood pressure with the help of the ultrasound-Doppler-method important influence factors and sources of errors are to be taken into consideration. In order to estimate the importance of restricted vascular compressibility, changed tissue conditions and different position of the body, pressure measurements in patients with arterial obstructive disease and in test persons with healthy vessels were performed. The mediasclerosis leads to an extensive rigidity of the arterial wall so that falsely high measuring values could be established which were lying significantly above the intravasal pressure. For examination in the femoral region of a cuff of the standard breadth in relation to the volume of the extremity is too narrow to guarantee a lossless transmission of the pressure on the artery. After passive change of the position also in the poststenotic region significant changes of the pressure can be proved. As is shown by the results the desired diagnostic evidence with the help of the Doppler pressure is to be got only in such a case, when relevant influence factors are considered and the measurement is performed under standardized conditions.
