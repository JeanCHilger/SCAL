Extracardiac hemodynamic effects of the calcium antagonist nifedipine. For the purpose of testing extracardial haemodynamic effects of the calcium antagonist nifedipine (corinfar) in 15 patients with arterial obstructive disease and in a control group plethysmographic and doppler-sonographic measurements before and after oral application of the substance were performed. In these cases after the application of nifedipine a significant increase of the blood flow in the crural region developed. At the same time a slight decrease of the systolic pressure could be established at the upper and lower extremity. In patients with arterial obstructive disease these haemodynamic reactions had a less significant result. They correspond to an arterial vasodilatation with decrease of the peripheral resistance and simultaneously they explain a part of the antianginous effect of the calcium antagonist. The increase of the blood flow which is to be objectified after the application of nifedipine also in poststenotic areas might be of clinical importance particularly in the combined occurrence of atherosclerotically conditioned disturbances of the blood supply of the coronary and peripheral vascular system.
