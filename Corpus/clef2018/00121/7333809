Carotid Doppler examination: a correlation with angiography. The Doppler ultrasound technique is a useful tool for the screening and follow-up of patients with extracranial atheromatous lesions of the carotid tree. Doppler examination was performed on 654 patients and compared with angiographic visualization of a total of 261 carotid arteries in 171 patients. The Doppler diagnostic criteria and their reliability are reported and discussed. This technique is not alternative but complementary to angiography.
