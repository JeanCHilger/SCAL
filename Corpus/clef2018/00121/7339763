Clinico-biological effectiveness of triflusal during the postoperative period of patients with chronic ischemic syndrome of the extremities. A group of 15 patients, suffering of chronic ischaemia of the lower limbs, were treated with triflusal, a new antiaggregant and antithrombotic agent, at the dose of 300 mg/day, during the first 90 days after artery by-pass grafting. Clinical exploration of patients included: physical inspection, pulses palpation, intermittent claudication (in metres), arteriography before surgery, and postoperative evolution of oscillometric and Doppler indexes. Determinations of platelet aggregation, induced by ADP, epinephrine and collagen, as well as of prothrombin time, platelet adhesiveness, and of thromboelastography parameters in PRP ane PPP were also carried out. Biochemical and hematological data were determined gastric tolerance and other side effects were written down. Results show a clear improvement of all patients due to surgery, but with triflusal, it has been possible to maintain a prophylactic effect without thrombosis of the graft or of the distal vessel of patients, during the postoperative period. Actually, lower limbs temperature and pulses were maintained, with a good capillary content and with an improved walking distance. No changes in prothrombin time an platelet adhesiveness, have been observed. Five patients showed a clear hypoaggregant tendency, and thromboelastography in PRP indicates a statistically significant increase of R and K parameters as well as a decrease of am. It must be noticed the absence of gastric, hepatic, renal or metabolic side effects and no haemorrhagic lesions were observed. In conclusion, the treatment of these patients with triflusal prevents the otherwise frequent appearance of postoperative thrombosis in this kind of arterial surgery.
