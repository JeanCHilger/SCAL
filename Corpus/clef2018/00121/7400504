Ultrasonic Doppler measurement of systolic pressure in the quantitative evaluation of chronic arterial occlusions. This study deals with a method of performing ultrasonic Doppler measurements in patients with chronic arterial occlusions. Ankle systolic pressures distal to occlusions (as diagnosed by angiography) were sampled and the mean values calculated. Standard deviations of the method were validated. The ultrasonic Doppler method for measurement of systolic pressure is a valuable new tool for assessing peripheral arterial occlusions. Especially in geriatric patients, with their high rate of vascular problems and the lingering danger of heel necrosis in the course of longstanding immobility, this method supplies the attending physician with quantitative data as a basis for diagnosis, prophylaxis, and treatment.
