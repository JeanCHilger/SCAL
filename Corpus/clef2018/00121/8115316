Regional arterial hemodynamics and carotid circulation in essential arterial hypertension. Effect of nitrendipine in patients over 40 years of age. Lesions of the arterial wall constitute one of the main complications of essential hypertension. The final objective of all antihypertensive drugs is to reduce the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates, but their short and medium term objectives must be to normalise blood pressure values and to correct the functional and structural abnormalities consecutive to arterial hypertension. In this double-blind drug versus placebo study conducted in 20 patients (14 men, 6 women) aged over 40, the effects of nitrendipine on regional arterial haemodynamics (aortic territory, upper limb, lower limb) and carotid circulation were evaluated. Nitrendipine was administered daily in doses of 20 mg during 1 month. After 4 weeks of treatment, the treated group showed a fall in blood pressure and an improvement in the pulse wave propagation (an index of arterial distensibility) in the carotido-femoral territory (11.4 +/- 1.7 vs 9.9 +/- 1.6 m/s P < 0.01) and in the humero-radial territory (12.9 +/- 2.0 vs 11.6 +/- 2.1 m/s
