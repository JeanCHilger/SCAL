Percutaneous recanalization of iliac artery occlusions: results of a prospective study. To evaluate the long-term results of recanalization of occluded iliac arteries with local low-dose thrombolysis, angioplasty, and, if necessary, stent implantation.Forty-seven patients with acute or chronic occlusions of the common or external iliac artery, or both, underwent local low-dose thrombolysis (n = 47), percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) (with balloon dilation [n = 43] and rotational angioplasty [n = 30] in the patients in whom a retrograde recanalization was performed), and, if needed, intravascular stent placement (n = 18). Follow-up lasted 3-53 (mean, 21) months.The primary recanalization rate was 98% (46 of 47). The mean ankle-brachial index increased from 0.33 to 0.81 within 14 days after treatment and was 0.76 at the most recent follow-up. Two early (< 14 days) and two late reocclusions (after 24 and 30 months) occurred one restenosis detected with duplex sonography and angiography was observed after 19 months.This therapy represents a true alternative to vascular surgery and a first-line treatment for acute or chronically occluded iliac arteries.
