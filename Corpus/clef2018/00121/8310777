Chronic anterior tibial syndrome. In two young athletic men we made the diagnosis of chronic tibialis anterior syndrome. Pain during strenuous exercise was localized in the anterolateral aspect of both calves. After stopping exercise the complaints disappeared within 15-20 minutes and not in 2-3 minutes as it would be typical for patients with atherosclerotic peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Diagnosis is based on patient history, normal clinical examination (systolic ankle pressure determined by Doppler-Sonography, electronic segmental oscillography) and increased intramuscular pressure at rest (> 10 mmHg) and after exercise (42 and 35 mmHg). Bilateral fasciotomy was performed in both patients. They are free of pain after 3 respectively 6 months postoperatively.
