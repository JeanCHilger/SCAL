Primary occlusion of the iliac and femoral artery in two newborn infants: efficacy of medical treatment. Arterial occlusion not associated with umbilical artery catheterization is a rare condition in the newborn period. Two neonates with femoral and iliac artery occlusion in the first days of life are presented. While almost all the cases described in the literature underwent surgical treatment, these two infants received only pharmacological treatment with good results. Although angiography remains the examination of choice for the diagnosis, noninvasive angiologic evaluations such as oscillometry and Doppler flow examination have been used for both diagnosis and follow-up. The etiology in these two cases remains unknown. The results obtained with these two neonates suggest that with prompt recognition of this disorder and an aggressive medical treatment, a complete recovery could be achieved.
