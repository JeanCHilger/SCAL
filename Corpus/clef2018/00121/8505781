Pedal bypass versus tibial bypass with autogenous vein: a comparison of outcome and hemodynamic results. Autogenous vein grafts to infrapopliteal arteries performed for chronic limb-threatening ischemia between 1984 and 1991 were reviewed to determine whether bypasses to pedal arteries produce results comparable to those obtained after supramalleolar tibial or peroneal bypasses.Pedal bypass (dorsal pedal, n = 41 below-ankle posterior tibial, n = 12) was performed only if a suitable tibial target artery was not available. These grafts were compared with tibial (including peroneal) bypass grafts (n = 203). All grafts were placed for rest pain (23%) or established tissue loss (77%).Patients requiring pedal bypass were more likely to have diabetes and congestive heart failure but less likely to have a history of smoking. Age, gender, previous myocardial infarction, and other comorbidities were similar in the two groups. Operative mortality rates (30 days) were higher for pedal than tibial bypasses (9% vs 2% p = 0.021), possibly reflecting the higher prevalence of diabetes, congestive heart failure, and more advanced systemic atherosclerosis associated with severe tibial artery disease. Most grafts were in situ saphenous vein (70% pedal vs 79% tibial). Life-table 3-year primary graft patency (58% pedal vs 61% tibial), secondary patency (82% pedal vs 79% tibial), limb salvage (92% pedal vs 87% tibial), and patient survival (61% pedal vs 64% tibial) were comparable in the two groups. Improved assisted primary patency and secondary patency rates in both groups were primarily a result of revision of graft-threatening lesions detected with noninvasive graft surveillance before thrombosis. Mean postoperative ankle/brachial index was similar for pedal and tibial bypasses, whereas mean duplex-estimated graft flow was less for pedal grafts (88 +/- 10 ml/min vs 129 +/- 6 ml/minWe conclude that autogenous vein pedal bypass grafts provide hemodynamic results and limb salvage rates comparable to more proximal tibial bypasses in properly selected patients.
