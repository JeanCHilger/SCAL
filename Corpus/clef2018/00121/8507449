Effects of canrenoate on red cell sodium transport and calf flow in essential hypertension. The effects of potassium canrenoate (100 mg/day, orally for 1 month) on blood pressure, calf blood flow at rest and after ouabain (0.5 mg intravenous bolus), and red cell Na homeostasis were investigated in 15 patients (7 men, 8 women, aged 18 to 63) with essential hypertension and without peripheral vascular diseases. On placebo, acute intravenous ouabain administration significantly and transiently reduced calf flow and increased calf vascular resistance without affecting blood pressure. Canrenoate significantly decreased blood pressure (from 159 +/- 21/105 +/- 9 mm Hg to 141 +/- 14/94 +/- 10, P < .05) and the rise of calf resistance after intravenous ouabain bolus. The latter effect was variable, since it was inhibited almost completely in 8 patients and unaffected in the others. In the patients in whom exogenously administered ouabain was antagonized, canrenoate diminished blood pressure through vasodilation and heightened the red cell Na/K pump. None of these parameters changed significantly in the other patients. Thus these data suggest that the fall in vascular resistance induced by canrenoate is mediated, in part, by the antagonism of endogenous ouabain-like factors.
