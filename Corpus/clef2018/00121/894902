Assessment of coronary/blood flow according to the indicators of the pressure-time ratio. The results of heart catheterization in 116 patients with different heart diseases, ischaemic lesions and arterial hypertension were processed. The diastolic pressure-time index characterizes the main part of the coronary flow, while the systomic pressure-time index of the corresponding ventricle--the myocardial requirements in the blood supply. The ratio of these indices corresponds to the demand/supply ratio. In normals, for the left ventricle it comprises 0.75+/-0.07 for both ventricles--0.95+/-0.07. This ratio grow in cases of ventricular hyperfunction and myocardial ischaemia.
