Sympathetic tonus and lumbar sympathectomy in arteriosclerosis obliterans of the arteries of the lower extremities. The Doppler laser flowmetry was used in order to study the microcirculation in the skin, muscles and bone marrow at different stages of obliterating atherosclerosis of the lower extremity arteries. Progress of the disease is characterized by a decrease of the absolute indices of blood flow in combination with disturbed regulation of vascular tension. The lumbar sympathectomy causes intensification of microcirculation not only in the skin, but also in the muscular and bone marrow tissues.
