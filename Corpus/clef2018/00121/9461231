Low-density lipoprotein oxidation and vitamins E and C in sustained and white-coat hypertension. Low-density lipoprotein oxidation and antioxidant vitamins E and C were investigated in white-coat hypertension in comparison with sustained hypertension and normotension. We selected 21 sustained hypertensive subjects, 21 white-coat hypertensive subjects, and 21 normotensive subjects matched for gender, age, and body mass index. White-coat hypertension was defined as clinical hypertension and daytime ambulatory blood pressure <139/90 (subjects were also reclassified using 134/90 and 135/85 mm Hg as cutoff points for daytime blood pressure). Blood samples were drawn for lipid profile determination, assessment of fluorescent products of lipid peroxidation in native LDL, evaluation of susceptibility to LDL oxidation in vitro (lag phase and propagation rate), and determination of LDL vitamin E and plasma vitamins E and C contents. Compared with sustained hypertensive subjects, white-coat hypertensives had significantly lower fluorescent products of lipid peroxidation (15.4+/-3.4 versus 10.2+/-3 units of relative fluorescence/mg LDL protein, P<.05), longer lag phase (54+/-10 versus 88+/-10 minutes, P<.05), lower propagation rate (8.2+/-2.5 versus 5.95+/-2.1 nmol diene/min per mg LDL cholesterol, P<.05), higher LDL vitamin E content (8.3+/-1.1 versus 10.1+/-1.8 nmol/mg LDL cholesterol, P<.05), and plasma vitamin C content (40+/-13 versus 57+9 micromol/L, P<. 05). No significant difference was observed between white-coat hypertensive and normotensive subjects. The results did not change after reclassification of subjects. Our data show that white-coat hypertensive subjects do not show an enhanced propensity to LDL oxidation or reduction in antioxidant vitamins. Given the role of LDL oxidation in the development of atherosclerosis and that of vitamin E and C in protecting against it, these findings suggest that white-coat hypertension per se carries a low atherogenic risk.
