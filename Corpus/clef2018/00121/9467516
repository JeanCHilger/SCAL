The Stresst'er ergometer as an alternative to treadmill testing in patients with claudication. To compare a new pedal ergometer (the Stresst'er) with conventional treadmill examination in patients with leg pain on exercise.Patients presenting with claudication were assessed by standard treadmill test and by the new device in two District General Hospitals.Ninety-four subjects were studied. Symptoms induced by both types of exercise were compared. Distance walked on the treadmill was compared to the number of pumps using the Stresst'er. The percentage change in ankle systolic pressure produced by the two tests was compared.Subjective symptoms induced by the tests were similar. Distance walked did correlate with pumps on the ergometer, as did change in systolic pressure. Analysis of a subgroup of 41 cases with receiver operator curve (ROC) tests showed that the new device is sensitive and specific.This new device is comparable with treadmill testing, but being easier to use, may have a place in the vascular clinic.
