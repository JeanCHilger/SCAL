Plasma insulin and ankle on brachial systolic blood pressure ratio in overweight men with hypertension. Hypertension is often associated with multiple metabolic abnormalities included in the insulin resistance syndrome. In hypertensive individuals, the ratio between ankle and brachial systolic blood pressure (ABI) is considered to be an independent cardiovascular risk factor. Insulin resistance has not been studied in relation to ABI ratio in men with essential hypertension and who are moderately overweight.To identify whether a decrease in the ABI ratio is associated with the degree of abdominal obesity and, hence, with the biochemical characteristics of resistance to insulin.In 166 overweight men with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension, insulinaemia was measured using radioimmunoassay. The ABI ratio was measured by using a pressure cuff of appropriate diameter, a standard mercury sphygmomanometer and a Doppler probe. Patients with diabetes or arteriosclerosis obliterans of the lower limbs, or both, were excluded from the study.The ABI ratio was significantly associated with the degree of abdominal obesity, but also with plasma triglycerides and cholesterol, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, plasma glucose and insulin. In a multiple regression analysis, the ABI ratio was significantly and negatively associated with only two variables: age and plasma insulin. This result was independent of age and drug treatment of hypertension.Because alterations in the ABI ratio may be considered markers of the changes in the structure and function of the arteries of lower limbs, the study provides evidence that plasma insulin, independently of atherosclerotic occlusive lesions, can significantly influence the status of conduit arteries of the lower limbs.
