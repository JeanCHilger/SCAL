Lipid levels and peripheral vascular disease in diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. Non-insulin dependent diabetes (NIDDM) is associated with an increased risk of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), but within the diabetic population the relationship between lipid profile and PVD has not been clearly defined. In this study we examined the association of lipid parameters and in particular low density lipoprotein (LDL) particle size, with the presence of PVD in subjects with and without NIDDM. 41 NIDDM patients and 31 non-diabetic subjects with PVD in the absence of rest pain or ulceration, defined by ankle-brachial index measurements and duplex scanning, were compared with 41 NIDDM and 31 euglycemic control subjects of comparable age and sex, without PVD. In both groups those with PVD were found to have significantly elevated triglycerides (2.7 [2.2-3.3] versus 1.9 [1.6-2.2] mmol/l P < 0.05 in the diabetic group and 2.0 [1.6-2.3] versus 1.4 [1.1-1.5] mmol/l
