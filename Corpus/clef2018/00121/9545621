Selectivity of superficial vein occlusion at the ankle and calf level: a methodological study in healthy volunteers. Judgement of deep venous function may be necessary before surgery for superficial vein incompetence is performed. Assessment of deep venous function needs selective entrapment of superficial venous compartments between the ankle and knee, which may not be guaranteed if conventional tourniquets are used. This study was, therefore, aimed at modifying the technique of selective compression of superficial vein compartments. Twenty apparently normal legs of 10 volunteers were investigated on two study days. The subjects were in a supine position with the feet resting 30 cm above heart level. Ankle cuffs (3 cm wide) were placed just above the malleoli and stepwise inflated with air. The steady-state venous volume of the forefoot as a function of the pressure within the ankle cuff was measured with a mercury-in-rubber strain gauge. The maximum venous outflow velocity from the foot was also measured at each cuff pressure step after the addition of conventional thigh vein occlusion. The same protocol was used on the second study day: calf cuffs (3 cm wide) were then used instead of the ankle cuffs. In the forefoot, venous volume increased and the maximum venous outflow velocity decreased significantly either at ankle cuff pressures > 30 mmHg or at calf cuff pressures of > 60 mmHg. By using small cuffs, selective superficial vein occlusion seems to occur at cuff pressures ranging between 10 and 30 mmHg (ankle) and between 30 and 60 mmHg (calf), provided the feet are 30 cm above heart level. Higher cuff pressures seem to interact with deep venous function.
