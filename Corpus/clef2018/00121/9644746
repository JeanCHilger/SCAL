Madecassol treatment of systemic and localized scleroderma. The trial of efficacy of 6-month therapy with madecassol (tablets, ointment, powder) of patients with systemic and focal scleroderma (SS and FS).54 patients (49 females and 5 males) aged 15 to 70 years with scleroderma running from 3 months to 15 years entered the study. 30 patients had typical SS, 24 patients had FS. Tablets were given to 18 patients, ointment was applied in 42 patients, powder in 3 and tablets + ointment in 9 patients. Madecassol 10 mg tablets were taken 3 times a day by patients with SS and advanced FS. The ointment was preferred in ulcers and scars on fingers and toes in SS and vascular trophic lesions in FS. In active focal scleroderma the ointment was applied to the skin lesions. The ointment was used 2 times a day (in the morning and evening) for 1-6 months. Madecassol powder was employed rarely, primarily of anal and vulval lesions.6-month oral course (30 mg/day) in 12 SS patients brought about a decrease of indurative lesions, hyperpigmentation (8), vascular trophic disorders (6) and improvement of general condition (5). Subjective response was good in 10 patients and corresponded to absence of progression. In progressive disease and diffuse skin lesions the drug was ineffective. The best response was obtained in local application of madecassol ointment on digital ulcers in SS.Madecassol is effective and well tolerated and therefore recommended for oral and local use in combined treatment of SS adn FS. Indications for per os utelization are: chronic or subchronic SS with limited skin involvement, advanced and/or prone to progression FS in which combined administration of the tablets and ointment is proposed.
