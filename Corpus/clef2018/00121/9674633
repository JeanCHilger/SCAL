Endothelial function and common carotid artery wall thickening in patients with essential hypertension. Intimal-medial thickening of the carotid wall is considered an early marker of atherosclerosis. Endothelial function is impaired in the presence of various cardiovascular risk factors that are implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. To evaluate the relationship between vascular reactivity and carotid intimal-medial thickening, in 44 (mean+/-SD age, 45.7+/-8.8 years range, 28 to 60 years
