Chronic iliac artery occlusion: treatment with the Strecker stent after PTA. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the use of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and subsequent. Strecker stent implantation for the treatment of chronic iliac artery occlusions. A total of 39 patients were subjected to this procedure. The occluded vessels were catheterized, dilated and subjected to stenting in all patients: the length of occlusion varied from 4.5 to 10.5 cm (mean 5.9), lesions were located in common iliac arteries (25), external iliac arteries (10) and in combinations of both (4). Twenty-five patients presented stage II according to Fontaine classification, nine patients stage III and five patients stage IV. The stent was mounted on balloon catheter and introduced through a 9 French sheet (for 8-10 mm stent diameter). After this procedure, 37 out of 39 patients showed a statistically significant increase in the Doppler sonographic ankle-arm index (AAI) (P = 0.001) and improvement of clinical symptoms, while in two patients a complete occlusion resulted due to long dissection not covered by the stent in one case and to stent misplacement in the other case. After stenting, 27 patients improved to stage I, ten patients to stage IIa and two patients showed no changes. Two complications were observed: one groin hematoma and one distal embolization. At a 6-month follow-up, a 89.7% of patency was observed. This study shows that Strecker stent can be successfully employed in addition to PTA to treat occlusions of the iliac arteries.
