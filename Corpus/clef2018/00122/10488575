Protective effect of left ventricular hypertrophy in right coronary artery occlusions. To test the hypothesis that left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) reduces the electrocardiographic and functional effects of right coronary artery occlusion.We analysed 215 patients (166 males and 49 women, age of 58.9 +/- 10.6 years), with occlusion of the right coronary artery without other associated lesions. There was no significant difference (p > 0.05) in age and gender distribution between the 78 patients with LVH (left ventricular mass > 100 g/m2) (Group A) when compared with the 137 patients without LVH (left ventricular mass < 100 g/m2) (Group B).The electrocardiographic finding of transmural necrosis was more often found in group B patients than in group A patients (56.9% and 30.8%, respectively p < 0.05). The left ventricular function parameters of group A were better than those of group B: the ratio end-diastolic pressure/systolic pressure (EDP/SP) (A: 0.108 +/- 0.036LVH reduces the effects of myocardial sequela and protects LV function when right coronary occlusion develops.
