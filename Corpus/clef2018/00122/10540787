Effect of Doppler flow and lipid studies in a geriatric population--increased flow left internal carotid artery only. Twenty geriatric subjects were treated with recombinant human growth hormone and results compared with a control group. The maximum dose of 3 units per day for 4 months was achieved in all patients. All patients had established atherosclerosis. Doppler Flow Studies were carried out at zero, 6 and 16 weeks. No alteration in plaque size or intima media thickness was observed. An increase in peak velocity in the treated group with a decrease in the control group in the left internal carotid artery only was observed. The study demonstrated a reduction in antero-posterior diameter of the left internal carotid in the treated group but the lesion grading remained unaltered. The expected reduction in total cholesterol LDL was however accompanied by a significant transient increase in triglyceride and P.A.I. 1. Fibrinogen levels were unaltered.
