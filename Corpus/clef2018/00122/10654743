Effect of hyperbaric oxygen and medicinal leeching on survival of axial skin flaps subjected to total venous occlusion. This study evaluates the effect of hyperbaric oxygen and medicinal leeching on axial skin flaps subjected to total venous occlusion. Axial epigastric skin flaps (3 x 6 cm) were elevated on their vascular pedicles in 40 male Wistar rats. Total venous occlusion was achieved by division of all veins draining the skin flap. Arterial inflow was left intact. Animals were randomly assigned to one of five groups: sham (n = 8) control, total venous occlusion only (n = 8)
