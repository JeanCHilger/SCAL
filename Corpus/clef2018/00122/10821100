Stent-graft treatment of a common carotid artery pseudoaneurysm. To report a case demonstrating successful endovascular treatment of a right common carotid artery pseudoaneurysm using a commercially prepared balloon-expandable covered stent.A 50-year-old man was evaluated for syncopal episodes. He had a history of severe trauma sustained in a motor vehicle accident 3 years before symptom onset. Doppler ultrasound scanning detected a pseudoaneurysm at the origin of the right common carotid artery. The defect measured 25 mm x 20 mm with a 22-mm-long neck on angiography and computed tomography there was no evidence of carotid stenosis or associated vascular pathology. Via a percutaneous femoral access, 2 Jostent peripheral stent-grafts were placed at the level of the aneurysm, safely achieving complete repair of the arterial wall defect. The patient was asymptomatic at his 12-month evaluation. Color flow duplex scans showed continued exclusion of the pseudoaneurysm.Wide-necked aneurysms in the extracranial carotid arteries may be treated with stent-grafts, which can achieve complete and permanent reconstruction of the arterial wall by excluding the aneurysm.
