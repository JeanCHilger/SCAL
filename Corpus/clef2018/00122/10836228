Value of the profundapopliteal collateral index for selecting between an in-flow and sequential arterial reconstruction in patients with multisegment arterial occlusive disease. It remains difficult for surgeons to choose between an in-flow and sequential arterial reconstruction in patients with multisegment arterial occlusive disease. In addition, the exact criterion for the proper revascularization procedures of these patients also remains obscure.The profundapopliteal collateral index (PPCI) was determined in all patients with occlusions of both the aortoiliac and superficial femoral arteries prior to undergoing an arterial bypass. The PPCI in the inflow bypass (IB) was also compared with the sequential bypass (SB).The symptoms of all patients undergoing either IB or SB improved. Preoperatively, the average PPCI in IB patients was significantly lower than that in SB patients. In addition, no significant difference was observed in the increased average rate of the ankle brachial index (ABI) between IB and SB.The PPCI is an accurate predictor of the hemodynamic potential of the geniculate collaterals. In cases with a low PPCI, especially in patients with multisegment arterial occlusive disease, in-flow procedures alone may often be sufficient for the successful treatment of such patients. The PPCI is thus considered to be useful for selecting the optimal revascularization procedures.
