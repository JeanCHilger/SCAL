Comparison of two Doppler ultrasound criteria for grading cervical internal carotid artery stenosis. In a review of 49 carotid arteries that had been assessed by ultrasound and angiography, two Doppler criteria were compared for accuracy in grading internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis. The Seattle criteria for Doppler spectral analysis and the internal-to-common carotid artery peak systolic velocity ratio were of similar accuracy. When used in combination, there was an increase in sensitivity compared with the use of a single criterion. The velocity ratio had a higher sensitivity for detection of high-grade stenosis, but it tended to overestimate the grade of stenosis more than the Seattle criteria. To increase the sensitivity for detection of severe stenosis, the criteria should be used together and the higher grade of stenosis should be taken if there is a mismatch in assessment.
