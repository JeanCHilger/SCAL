Changes in optic nerve head blood flow and retrobular hemodynamics following calcium-channel blocker treatment of normal-tension glaucoma. Because calcium channel blockers reduce vascular resistance, they may have a clinical application in the treatment of normal-tension glaucoma (NTG). This study investigates changes in both the optic disc blood flow and the hemodynamics of retrobulbar vessels in NTG patients after the systemic administration of a calcium channel blocker.Twelve eyes of 12 NTG patients (mean age 57.6 +/- 15.3 years) were examined before and after a 4-week treatment with 2 mg b.i.d. oral nilvadipine, an L-typc calcium channel blocker. By scanning laser-Doppler flowmetry (SLDF), we obtained the velocity, flow, and volume from within a 10 x 10 pixel window placed on the temporal rim region of the optic disc perfusion map. By ultrasound color Doppler imaging (CDI), we measured the peak systolic velocity (PSV) and the end diastolic velocity (EDV) of the ophthalmic artery (OA), central retinal artery (CRA), nasal posterior ciliary artery (NPCA), and temporal posterior ciliary artery (TPCA). We then calculated a resistance index (RI) for each vessel.After treatment, the flow and velocity of the optic disc blood flow significantly increased (P < 0.05). Nilvadipine also significantly reduced RIs of the CRA, NPCA, and TPCA (P < 0.05), and increased both the PSV of the NPCA and the EDVs of the CRA, NPCA, and TPCA. The percent change in velocity correlated significantly with the percent changes of the CRA RI and NPCA RI.Oral nilvadipine appears to reduce orbital vascular resistance, which consequently increases the optic disc blood flow.
