Local tumor recurrence following hepatic cryoablation: radiologic-histopathologic correlation in a rabbit model. To use radiologic-histopathologic correlation in an animal model to distinguish normal postoperative findings from evidence of residual tumor after cryoablation of malignant hepatic tumors.Hepatic cryoablation was performed in 12 rabbits with VX2 tumors and in two healthy rabbits. Nonenhanced and dynamic contrast material-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and power and color Doppler flow ultrasonography (US) were performed 7-8 days after cryoablation. Histopathologic findings were correlated with imaging findings.Twenty tumors of 5-20 mm (mean, 10 mm) and seven areas of normal liver were treated with cryolesions of 11-21 mm (mean, 15 mm). All cryolesions exhibited arterial phase rim enhancement at CT and MR imaging, and 13 (57%) of 23 lesions demonstrated peripheral flow at US because of granulation tissue. There was macroscopic recurrence in 15 (75%) of 20 treated tumors 14 (93%) appeared as peripheral nodularity with low-grade enhancement. Necrotic tissue did not enhance. Intact vessels extended up to 6 mm inside cryolesion margins and caused focal internal enhancement and Doppler flow. Areas of high signal intensity on T2-weighted MR images correlated with liquefaction necrosis, granulation tissue, and tumor.In this animal model, recurrent tumor typically appeared as focal nodules at the cryolesion periphery. Rim and central foci of enhancement, Doppler flow, and increased signal intensity on T2-weighted MR images can be normal findings after hepatic cryoablation.
