Selecting patients for combined femorofemoral bypass grafting and iliac balloon angioplasty and stenting for bilateral iliac disease. This study examines the selection of patients for combined femorofemoral bypass (FFB) grafting and iliac balloon angioplasty (IBA) and stenting for bilateral iliac occlusive disease (successively or simultaneously) and the correlation of the length and location of stenoses of the donor iliac artery to the success of FFB grafts.Forty-one patients with long iliac occlusion and significant contralateral iliac stenosis were treated with combined FFB grafting and IBA and stenting, which were performed simultaneously or percutaneously within 1 to 2 days before surgery. Stenting was performed for suboptimal IBAs. IBA/graft patency was evaluated by duplex scanning/ankle-brachial index at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and every 12 months thereafter. A life-table analysis of patency was performed, according to the length of stenosis as classified by the Society of Cardiovascular Interventional Radiology (group A, < 3 cm and 3-5 cm group B, > 5 cm).Indications for surgery were limb salvage (22%), rest pain (44%), and claudication (34%). The mean follow-up time was 34.1 months. Perioperative complications were 7% for group A versus 62% for group B (P = .0007) with no perioperative deaths or amputations. Stenting was needed in 12 of 13 patients (92%) in group B versus four of 28 patients (14%) in group A (P < .0001) and in 11 of 12 external iliac artery lesions versus five of 29 common iliac artery lesions (P < .0001). The overall early success rate was 100% for group A and 62% for group B (P = .0028). The primary patency rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 96%, 85%, and 85% for group A, respectively, and for group B were 46%, 46%, and 31%, respectively (P < .01). The secondary patency rates for group A at 1, 2, and 3 years were 100%, 96%, and 87%, respectively and for group B were 62%, 54%, and 27%, respectively (P < .001). The overall primary and secondary patency rates for common iliac and external iliac artery lesions were similar (72% and 72% versus 67% and 75%, respectively). The overall limb salvage rates were 96% for group A and 85% for group B. Seven of 13 patients (54%) of group B, in contrast with 0 of 28 patients in group A, had to undergo a revision of the procedure within 30 days (P < .01).Combined use of IBA and stenting and FFB grafting is effective and durable and can be performed simultaneously, if the donor iliac stenosis length is 5 cm or less. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty/stenting of stenoses of 5 cm or more fail to support FFB grafting in most patients therefore, their combination should be questioned.
