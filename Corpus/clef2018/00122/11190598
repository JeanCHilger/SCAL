Successful lysis of an obstructive aortic and renal artery thrombus in a neonate on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. We describe a neonate on venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) with acute renal failure associated with extensive aortic and bilateral renal artery thrombosis. Concurrent anticoagulation and continuous systemic thrombolytic therapy with tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) resulted in complete thrombolysis as evaluated by Doppler flow. The relative risk and benefits of thrombolytic therapy in heparinized patients undergoing ECMO needs to be further studied.
