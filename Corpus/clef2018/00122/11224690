Ischemic nephropathy. Ischemic nephropathy is a major cause of chronic renal failure in people over 50 years of age. In addition, renal artery stenosis is associated with increased mortality, particularly if renal or cardiac function is compromised. The diagnosis is made both by clinical characteristics and imaging studies. At present, duplex Doppler ultrasound and magnetic resonance angiography appear to be the most promising non-invasive screening tests. Although data from controlled trials are lacking, revascularization is the mainstay of therapy for ischemic nephropathy. Advances in percutaneous interventions now allow revascularization to be offered to many patients, including those who are poor surgical candidates. The role of medical therapies (statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, intensive control of blood pressure) and how to best utilize revascularization (which patients and when) remain to be defined.
