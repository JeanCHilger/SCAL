Pseudohypertension in a patient with diffuse scleroderma. Pseudohypertension is the artifactual elevation of blood pressure that occurs secondary to noncompressible blood vessels. It has been described in patients with uremia, diabetes mellitus, and severe atherosclerosis. If unrecognized, the condition may lead to inappropriate and potentially harmful therapy. We report a case of pseudohypertension in a 65-year-old man with diffuse scleroderma. His blood pressure as assessed by conventional sphygmomanometry was at least 240/135 to 145 mm Hg. Intra-arterial blood pressure was found to be 107/52 mm Hg. The severe rise in blood pressure as measured by sphygmomanometry led to the concern of scleroderma renal crisis and potentially harmful therapy. Intra-arterial pressure monitoring confirmed the presence of pseudohypertension, however. This is the first reported case of pseudohypertension in a patient with diffuse scleroderma.
