Some observations on peripheral venous pressure using a non-invasive technique: a preliminary report. Observations are presented which suggest that peripheral venous pressure can be measured indirectly by a non-invasive technique at the bedside, using a portable Doppler ultrasound flowmeter. The pressure at which the audio signals are heard over veins on release of the occluding cuff seems to be a measure of peripheral venous pressure. This is supported by showing a correlation between the method and conditions in which raised venous pressure in the lower limb are known to exist. The results of a few direct venous pressure measurements are reported which appear to give added support. It is suggested that this simple non-invasive technique may be of value in detecting certain cases of deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremities.
