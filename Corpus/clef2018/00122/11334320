Renovascular hypertension associated with neurofibromatosis: two cases and review of the literature. The authors report two cases of renovascular hypertension associated with neurofibromatosis. A 19-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with a complaint of abdominal pain and blood pressure of 180/120 mmHg. Examination revealed café-au-lait spots over her chest and extremities. Peripheral plasma renin activity (PRA) under basal conditions was 2.8 ng/ml/h and increased to 12.6 ng/ml/h after administration of 50 mg captopril. Plasma and urinary catecholamines were normal. Selective renal angiography showed left aneurysmal dilatation of the segmentary branch and right renal artery stenosis with multiple aneurysmal affecting different branches. Blood pressure was controlled by multiple drugs, including beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Another patient, a 20-year-old woman, was admitted because of severe arterial hypertension, numerous café-au-lait spots, scoliosis, and mass over the right arm. PRA from the right renal vein was extremely elevated, and selective angiography demonstrated bilateral renal artery stenosis. Aortorenal bypass was performed successfully.
