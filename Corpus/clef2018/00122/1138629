Results of ankle ststolic pressure measurements in patients with intermittent claudication being treated with clofibrate. Ankle systolic pressure measurements in 67 patients with intermittent claudication treated with Clofibrate for an average period of 11 months and 32 untreated patients suggest that 1) patients with a raised initial plasma fibrinogen concentration have more severe disease than those with low initial plasma fibrinogen concentration and 2) the response to treatment with Clofibrate is significantly better in those with a raised plasma fibrinogen concentration. On the basis of the patients own estimation of their claudication distance there was marked symptomatic inprovement in the treated patients. There was also a significant decrease in mean plasma fibrinogen levels in the treated patients and it is suggested that the hypofibrinogenemic effect of Clofibrate may be responsible for the benefit of this drug in patients with vascular disease.
