Coriolis-induced cutaneous blood flow increase in the forearm and calf. Using venous occlusion plethysmography, Sunahara et al. reported that Coriolis-induced nausea was accompanied by an increase in forearm blood flow, suggesting a decrease in sympathetic activity to this vascular bed. No significant blood pressure and heart rate changes were observed. Vasodilation of the limbs theoretically impairs orthostatic tolerance, particularly if blood flow is shown to increase simultaneously in the lower limbs. This study examined the latter possibility. Seventeen subjects were exposed to the Coriolis cross-coupling effects induced by 20 RPM yaw rotation, and a simultaneous 45 degrees pitch forward head movement in the sagittal plane every 12 s. Forearm and calf skin blood flow were monitored in real-time using laser Doppler flowmetry (PeriFlux 4001). Our results indicated a significant (p < 0.001) simultaneous forearm and calf skin blood flow increase as a result of Coriolis cross-coupling across all 15 susceptible subjects. No significant changes in blood pressure and heart rate were observed. Coriolis-induced cardiovascular changes may confound previous reports on reduced G tolerance using ground-based centrifuges that invariably evoke cross-coupling effects.
