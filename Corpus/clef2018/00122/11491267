Endovascular stent-grafting in the treatment of superficial femoral artery occlusive disease. To explore the feasibility of using a flexible stent-graft in the treatment of superficial femoral artery occlusive lesions.Thirty-five patients (26 men median age 65 years, range 41-85) with long-segment occlusions of the femoropopliteal arteries were treated with the Hemobahn endovascular prosthesis. The median occlusion length was 22 cm (range 4-40). Endografting was performed in conjunction with additional recanalization procedures as needed.Primary recanalization and deployment of 47 Hemobahn endografts was successful in all cases 12 patients had 2 devices implanted. The adjunctive recanalization techniques included balloon thrombectomy (n = 28), ring-stripper disobliteration (n = 7), local thrombolysis (n = 2), mechanical rotational thrombectomy (n = 2), local thromboendarterectomy and femoral bifurcation patch angioplasty (n = 14), iliac artery stenting (n = 3), and bypass grafting (n = 2). The median ankle-brachial index rose from 0.25 preoperatively to 0.87. Over an average 7-month follow-up (range 1-18), 10 (28.6%) occlusions occurredIntraoperative use of the Hemobahn endograft is feasible and effective in restoring adequate distal perfusion in the short term, especially when combined with conventional recanalization techniques.
