Excimer laser-assisted recanalisation of femoral arterial stenosis or occlusion caused by the use of Angio-Seal. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the effect of excimer laser and balloon angioplasty of femoral artery stenosis and occlusion after use of a haemostatic puncture closure device. A haemostatic puncture closure device (Angio-Seal) was used in 6000 patients after diagnostic or therapeutic artery catheterisation. In 34 of those patients symptoms of peripheral artery disease occurred. Sixteen of those 34 cases were transferred to our clinic for excimer laser angioplasty. All 16 patients presented with symptoms of acute peripheral artery disease within 1-14 days: superficial femoral artery (SFA) occlusions (4 cases) superficial femoral artery stenosis (3 cases)
