Estimation of the heritability of latent variables which are included in a structural model for metabolic syndrome. In a study looking for risk factors of atherosclerosis in families with combined hyperlipidemia and hypertension, clinical and biochemical data of 1,149 persons were analyzed to develop two hypothetical multivariate scores concerning the degree to which a patient is affected by the metabolic syndrome. The scores are based on a structural model for low-density cholesterol (LDL) and high-density cholesterol (HDL), triglycerides, uric acid, creatinine, glucose, insulin, systolic blood pressure and waist-to-hip ratio. Age, gender and body mass index were used for adjusting all variables. In segregation analyses of 42 pedigrees without using genotype information, estimations of the heritabilities and environmentally caused variance and covariance components were computed for the individual score values of the two latent factors. The first score shows a heritability of 42% the environment component disappeared. The score mainly reflects the HDL, LDL and triglyceride levels. The second score shows a heritability of 16% with an environment component of 7%. It includes mainly insulin, uric acid and creatinine. In the search for genetic causes, both scores could be a basis for further phenotypic classification of the metabolic syndrome.
