Inflatable pillows as axillary support devices during surgery performed in the lateral decubitus position under epidural anesthesia. The lateral decubitus position can cause dependent shoulder discomfort or result in traction on the brachial plexus. We measured pressure beneath the dependent shoulder and lateral angulation of the cervical spine in patients positioned in the lateral decubitus position for total hip replacement under epidural anesthesia. Inflatable pillows (Shoulder-Float) beneath the chest wall and head reduced pressure beneath the dependent shoulder from 66 to 12 mm Hg (P < 0.001) and lateral angulation of the cervical spine from 14 degrees to 4 degrees (P < 0.001). In a randomized crossover study of a further 15 patients, the use of inflatable pillows resulted in significantly less pressure beneath the dependent shoulder and chest wall than either a gel-pad or a 1000-mL lactated Ringer's bag. Inflatable pillows placed beneath the chest wall and head in the lateral decubitus position provided lower pressure beneath the dependent shoulder than other support devices and facilitated alignment of the cervical spine.When patients lie on their side, this results in pressure beneath the shoulder and tilting of the head and neck to one side. These problems were effectively corrected with an inflatable pillow (Shoulder-Float).
