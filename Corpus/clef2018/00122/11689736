Ankle to brachial pressure index in normal subjects and trained cyclists with exercise-induced leg pain. This study compared ankle to brachial pressure indices (ABPI) before and after maximal exercise in three groups in order to investigate maximal exercise testing and ABPI as a useful procedure for the differential diagnosis of exercise-induced leg pain (EILP) in athletes.ABPI measurements were taken before and after cycle ergometer exercise to volitional exhaustion or reproduction of symptoms in three groups: 1) untrained individuals (N = 10, 3 female, 7 male age 35 +/- 5 yr (mean +/- SD))Resting blood pressure indices were similar in all groups. ABPI were reduced (P < 0.05) in all groups after exercise. No differences between left and right legs were noted in the elite and untrained groups however, a significant difference (P < 0.05) was noted between the nonsymptomatic (0.79 +/- 0.10) and symptomatic (0.61 +/- 0.20) legs in the subjects with EILP. Despite these group results, only three subjects in the symptomatic group met the published criteria (index of < 0.5) for endofibrosis of the external iliac artery. All positive ABPI tests were subsequently confirmed via arteriogram.Maximal exercise testing combined with ABPI measurement is a simple noninvasive procedure that may be useful for the examination of EILP. The results of this study suggest that, in cases with unilateral symptoms, a between-leg ABPI difference of 0.18 (at the first minute of recovery) may be considered as a useful additional diagnostic criterion.
