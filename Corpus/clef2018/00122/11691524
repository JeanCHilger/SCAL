Lack of evidence for peripheral alpha(1)- adrenoceptor blockade during long-term treatment of heart failure with carvedilol. The purpose of this study was to determine whether carvedilol's alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonism persists during long-term therapy of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF).Carvedilol and metoprolol differ in that carvedilol also antagonizes beta(2)- and alpha(1)-adrenoceptors. We hypothesized that in contrast to metoprolol, carvedilol would increase calf vascular conductance (CVC), blunt neurally mediated vasoconstriction and attenuate neuroeffector transfer function gain.We randomized 36 patients with CHF (age 55 +/- 1 years, ejection fraction 19 +/- 1%, means +/- SE) to either drug. Blood pressure (BP), heart rate, muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) and CVC were assessed before and after four months of treatment. The variability of BP and MSNA was determined using fast Fourier transformation.Paired data were obtained in 23 (carvedilol, 13 metoprolol, 10) subjects. Both beta-blockers decreased heart rate, but neither affected mean BP or CVC (carvedilol: 0.016 +/- 0.002 to 0.018 +/- 0.003 UCarvedilol did not increase CVC, blunt the calf vasoconstrictor response to handgrip or attenuate the gain of the neuroeffector transfer function, indicating the absence of functionally important peripheral alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonism during long-term treatment of CHF.
