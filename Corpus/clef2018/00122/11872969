Current practice and future promise for clinical noninvasive measurements of subclinical atherosclerotic disease in the elderly. The detection, treatment, and follow-up of subclinical vascular disease are becoming clinically essential components of cardiovascular disease prevention in the elderly. Noninvasive measurements are available for different vascular beds, including carotid, coronary, aortic, and peripheral arterial circulation. Current interest in these measures is aimed at improving the accuracy of risk prediction for coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease. Indirect physical examination and imaging evaluations detect significant obstruction of flow in the peripheral arteries. Doppler measures of ankle-arm blood pressure index represent a simple, indirect test that has been shown to be predictive of incident cardiovascular disease independent of risk factors. Newer, high-resolution tests allow direct detection and quantitation of the burden of atherosclerosis and vascular disease within the arterial wall, independent of flow obstruction. Carotid intimal-medial thickness predicts incident coronary heart disease and stroke in the elderly, even after adjustment for traditional risk factors. Coronary calcium can be accurately detected by computed tomography and is a strong predictor of the incidence of coronary heart disease events. Evidence is accruing that coronary calcium screening will play a role in prevention in the elderly. Magnetic resonance imaging is currently under study as a promising modality for detection and quantification of aortic and carotid plaque. Ongoing studies will provide important information regarding the appropriate role of the many newer, high-resolution tests of subclinical atherosclerosis in disease prediction, treatment, and tracking of disease progression in the elderly.
