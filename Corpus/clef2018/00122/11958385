Small and large artery elasticity indices in peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD). In peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD), arterial compliance of the central arteries has been reported to be reduced. It is, however, not clear whether, in PAOD, decreased arterial compliance is also accompanied by similar changes in the peripheral arteries. Therefore the aim of the study was to determine the large (C1) and small (C2) artery elasticity indices in PAOD and their relations to its well-accepted characteristics (ankle-brachial index, ABI pulse pressure, PP
