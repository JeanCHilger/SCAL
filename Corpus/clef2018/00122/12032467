Role of aortofemoral bypass in the management of unilateral iliac occlusive disease. A follow-up study of 95 patients over a 25-year period. To evaluate the results in a series of patients submitted to aortofemoral bypass due to an unilateral iliac occlusion.Retrospective follow-up study. A total of 95 patients underwent, between 1975 and 2000, aortofemoral bypass because of unilateral iliac occlusion. Most of them (71 patients) were claudicants, Fontaine stage II b, while 12 complained rest pain and 12 suffered ischemic ulcers. Mean follow-up was 128 months (min 2.5 - max 292).Immediate success was obtained in 88 cases (92.6%), 7 patients were submitted to early redo with restored patency in 6 cases. One month global patency was gained in 98.9% (94 cases). The mean Ankle-brachial index (ABI) improvement was 0.35. At a mean follow-up of 128 months the cumulative patency was 90.8%. During the follow-up, 15 graft occlusions were observed, followed by 9 successful reoperations achieving a 5-year secondary patency of 92.1%. The contralateral iliac artery evolved toward an occlusion in 10 patients (10.5%) during a long time observation (104 months average).The unilateral aortofemoral bypass confirmed an excellent long term outcome regarding effectiveness and graft related complications. The low contralateral occlusion rate, in our series, does not justify a more aggressive approach as first surgical option.
