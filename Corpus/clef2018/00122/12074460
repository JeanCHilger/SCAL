Use of the buccal fat pad in maxillary and sinus grafting of the severely atrophic maxilla preparatory to implant reconstruction of the partially or completely edentulous patient: technical note. To examine the use of the buccal fat pad (BFP) for correction of maxillary osseous defects, preliminary to dental implant reconstructions, and to present patients in whom this technique was used.The blood supply of the BFP was investigated with a special laser Doppler flowmetry fiberoptic probe in situ before herniation and after placement of the pedicled BFP over maxillary bone grafts.The possibility of using the BFP pedicle flap to provide an immediate blood supply to a recipient site was confirmed, as it promotes rapid neo-vascularization of the grafted material over which it is placed. No complications were seen in the present patients.The BFP has an additional protective function of providing for a multiple-layer wound closure over all types of maxillary bone grafts, thereby preventing graft exposure and enhancing success.With its high blood flow, the BFP may offer protection and early blood supply to maxillary and sinus bone grafts.
