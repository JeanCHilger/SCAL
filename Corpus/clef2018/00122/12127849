Cerebral haemodynamic aspects of severe carotid stenosis: asymptomatic vs symptomatic. to compare cerebral haemodynamics in patients with asymptomatic and symptomatic severe (> or =70%) internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis.we assessed 195 consecutive patients, 116 with asymptomatic carotid stenosis (ACS) and 79 with symptomatic carotid stenosis (SCS). Using transcranial Doppler we assessed cerebral vasoreactivity (CVR) following acetazolamide test, the middle cerebral artery flow velocity ratio after/before carotid clamping (mv-MCA ratio), and the carotid back pressure (CBP) during crossclamping.no significant differences between the two groups were demonstrated regarding CVR (47 vs 39%), mv-MCA ratio (50 vs 52%), or CBP (36 vs 44 mmHg). However, in patients with contralateral ICA occlusion all three variables were significantly lower as compared to patients with patent contralateral ICA. Also patients who needed a shunt during surgery had significantly lower values of mv-MCA ratio and CBP. Patients who suffered peri-operative neurologic deficits (n=6 3%) did not differ from patients who had an uneventful course.clinical state of ICA stenosis is independent of cerebral haemodynamics. Occluded contralateral ICA is more important for predicting cerebral ischaemia caused by carotid clamping. Finally, none of the haemodynamic parameters showed predictive value for peri-operative neurologic morbidity.
