Peripheral vascular disease as predictor of outcome after coronary artery bypass grafting. Understanding and objective assessment of risks is crucial in cardiac surgery. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) on morbidity, mortality and outcome in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) patients.The ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) was used as indicator of PVD and was measured in 178 CABG patients. Two groups were established: 1. normal ABPI (0.9-1.3) (n = 136) and 2. lowered ABPI (< 0.9) (n = 35). The mean follow-up was 26 months.The presence of PVD was 20.5 %. Patients with PVD were older (p < 0.05), more often of female sex (p < 0.05), had higher Higgins's risk score (p = 0.001) and more often intermittent claudication (IC) (p < 0.001). PVD significantly predicted atrial fibrillation (FA) (p < 0.05) and relatively postoperative myocardial infarction (MI) (p = 0.058).The presence of PVD is relatively high in CABG patients and increases with age. PVD predicts some morbidity but seems to have fairly little influence on short-term or middle-term outcome of CABG patients. ABPI may be of only limited value in identifying patients with high operative risk in CABG.
