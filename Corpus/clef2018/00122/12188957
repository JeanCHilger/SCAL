Norepinephrine in the rat cortex before and after occlusion of chronic arteriovenous fistulae: a microdialysis study in an animal model of cerebral arteriovenous malformations. In an animal model, we tested the hypothesis that intracerebral, extracellular norepinephrine (NE) influences cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the presence of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs).A microdialysis (MD) probe was implanted into the cortices of Sprague-Dawley rats 3 months after the creation of extracranial arteriovenous fistulae (AVFs n = 19), carotid ligation (n = 10), and cervical vessel preparation (sham operationsNE was highest in sham-operated animals and lowest after carotid ligation as compared with before and after the creation of the AVFs (sham operations, 5.9 +/- 2.3 nmol/L common carotid artery ligation, 2.4 +/- 1 nmol/LThe model seems to be valid for the simulation of events that occur before and after the obliteration of human cerebral AVMs in most cases, but not in those prone to hyperperfusion syndromes. The results provide evidence that cerebral sympathetic nervous system activity can be monitored by in vivo MD and that NE may play a role in CBF control before and after the obliteration of AVFs.
