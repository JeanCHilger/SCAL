Wavelet de-noising of laser Doppler reactive hyperemia signals to diagnose peripheral arterial occlusive diseases. In order to improve peripheral arterial occlusive diseases (PAOD) diagnoses, five de-noising algorithms based on a multiresolution analysis computed with wavelets are applied on reactive hyperemia signals obtained with the laser Doppler flowmetry technique. Results are presented on recordings acquired on patients suffering from PAOD and on healthy subjects.
