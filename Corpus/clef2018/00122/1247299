The effects of femoropopliteal vein graft failure on limb function. Twenty-one patients were followed for an average of 40 months following occlusion of femoropopliteal vein grafts. Serial recordings of the resting ankle pressure index and treadmill walking time were correlated with the patient's clinical status, and compared to the preoperative values. Graft failure resulted in a return to preoperative status in ten of 11 limb salvage patients. There were 5 amputations, 3 died of unrelated causes, and 2 were subsequently improved by further reconstructions. At last followup, 3 of 10 patients who were operated on for claudication were unchanged, 6 were improved, and one became worse. In no case did graft failure result in the development of advanced ischemia. Femoropopliteal graft failure did not have a significantly adverse effect on limb function or survival in patients presenting with claudication, nor did it complicate the subsequent course of patients in whom the initial aim was limb salvage.
