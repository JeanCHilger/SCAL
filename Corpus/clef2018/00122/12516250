Management of coexistent advanced coronary artery disease and internal carotid artery stenosis. We discuss a case of a 60-year old man admitted to our Department with symptoms of unstable angina and stenosis of carotid artery. Coronary angiography revealed three-vessel coronary artery disease. Doppler ultrasound (USG) and multislice spiral computed tomography (MSCT) of carotid and vertebral arteries showed a high-grade stenosis of the left internal carotid artery with a poststenotic aneurysm containing thrombi. Since the risk of a simultaneous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and carotid endarterectomy (CEA) was assessed as high, a two-staged procedure was performed. The CEA was performed first and one month later patient underwent CABG with a good result.
