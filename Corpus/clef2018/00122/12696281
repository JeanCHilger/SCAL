Noninvasive imaging of the abdominal vessels. Color Doppler ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), multi detector CT, CT-angiography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), MR-angiography are playing an increasingly important role for noninvasive examinations of the abdominal vessels. The most frequently studied abdominal vessels are the aorta and the renal arteries. The most common abdominal vascular diseases include: renal artery stenosis, renovascular hypertension, ischemic nephropathy and end-stage renal disease. Scintigraphy, color Doppler US, CT-angiography and MR-angiography have been used for the evaluation of patients. The mesenteric artery and celiac axis are less frequently studied however some important information is provided by these imaging procedures.
