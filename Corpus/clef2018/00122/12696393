Cardiovascular reactivity and cardiovascular risk factors in normotensive individuals of less than 40 years of age. Cardiovascular hyperactivity has been found to be related to cardiovascular risk factors among the population as a whole. Knowing whether these factors are also related to the population of individuals under age 40 could be important for modifying lifestyles and for taking action to prevent cardiovascular diseases.A representative comparative study was made out of 249 individuals with normal blood pressure, of both sexes, within the 18-40 age range. These individuals were divided into two groups based on the results of the hand-held weight test (HHWT), this test take into account the use of an isometric exercise to achieve cardiovascular reactivity. One of the groups was composed of individuals with cardiovascular hyperreactivity (n = 62), with blood pressure (BP) values of equal or higher 90/140 mmHg following the hand-held weight test, the other group was composed of individuals with normal cardiovascular reactivity (n = 187), with blood pressure values less 90/140 mmHg. Using a logic regression model, the relationship was determined by age, sex, family history of FH of HBP), physical activity (PhysAct), cigarette-smoking (CS), alcoholic beverage intake (ABI), salt intake (SI) and race with the condition of cardiovascular hyperreactivity.The risk of having cardiovascular hyperreactivity was double for those individuals who had a family history of high blood pressure (OR = 2.88 IC 95%: 1.54-5.36). For every year of age, the risk of hyperreactivity increased 1.08 times, having increased up to 1.14 times. On the other hand, the body mass index revealed a significant relationship independent of the condition of vascular hyperreactivity (OR = 1.11 IC 95%: 1.01-1.21). None of the other variables studies showed any relationship to the condition of cardiovascular hyperreactivity.Individuals within the 18-40 age range who have normal blood pressure, have a higher risk of cardiovascular reactivity if they have a family history of high blood pressure, if their body mass index increases and with the age increment.
