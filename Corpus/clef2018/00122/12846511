Left main coronary artery ostial stenosis: the role of transoesophageal echocardiography. Transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) using colour flow Doppler and intracoronary flow velocity measurements by pulsed Doppler may be helpful in detecting coronary artery disease. We present a case of a middle-aged man in whom left main ostial stenosis was detected by TEE after two non-diagnostic coronary angiographies. The main message of our case is that TEE was performed and was diagnostic after two non-diagnostic coronary angiographies. If ischaemia is confirmed TEE should be performed in cases of negative coronary angiographies to rule out left main ostial stenosis.
