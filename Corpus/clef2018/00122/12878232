Comparison of eigenvector methods with classical and model-based methods in analysis of internal carotid arterial Doppler signals. Doppler ultrasound is known as a reliable technique, which demonstrates the flow characteristics and resistance of arteries in various vascular disease. In this study, internal carotid arterial Doppler signals recorded from 105 subjects were processed by PC-computer using classical, model-based, and eigenvector methods. The classical method (fast Fourier transform), two model-based methods (Burg autoregressive, least-squares modified Yule-Walker autoregressive moving average methods), and three eigenvector methods (Pisarenko, multiple signal classification, and Minimum-Norm methods) were selected for processing internal carotid arterial Doppler signals. Doppler power spectra of internal carotid arterial Doppler signals were obtained using these spectrum analysis techniques. The variations in the shape of the Doppler power spectra were examined in order to obtain medical information. These power spectra were then used to compare the applied methods in terms of their frequency resolution and the effects in determination of stenosis and occlusion in internal carotid arteries.
