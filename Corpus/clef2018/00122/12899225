Prostatic atrophy: evidence for a possible role of local ischemia in its pathogenesis. Prostatic atrophy may be histologically and at ultrasound similar to adenocarcinoma causing diagnostic confusion, its frequency increases with age but the etiopathogenesis is unknown. Based on a systematic study in autopsies previously done by one of us, ischemia due to local intense arteriosclerosis seems to be a potential factor for its pathogenesis. Absent blood flow in areas of prostatic atrophy might be a further evidence for a possible role of ischemia. From a total of 298 patients biopsied and studied by gray-scale and color Doppler transrectal ultrasound in the period 1998 to 2001, 33 patients had suspicious lesions (37 hypoechoic nodules and 3 heterogeneous lesions) showing prostatic atrophy as the only diagnosis on all these biopsied lesions. Adenocarcinoma, high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia or other atypical lesions were absent in all patients. On color Doppler the suspicious areas showed absent flow in 24/40 (60%), present flow in 12/40 (30%), and increased flow in 4/40 (10%) of the lesions. Absent flow in the majority of the lesions studied may be a further evidence for a possible role of local ischemia in the etiopathogenesis of prostatic atrophy.
