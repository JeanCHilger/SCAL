Are elevated homocysteine plasma levels related to peripheral arterial disease? Results from a cross-sectional study of 6880 primary care patients. It is still unclear whether the strength of the association between elevated plasma homocysteine (HC) levels and peripheral arterial disease (PAD), coronary artery disease (CAD) and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) is similar.Fasting homocysteine plasma levels were measured in 6880 unselected primary care patients aged 65 years or older. Presence of PAD was determined with the ankle brachial index, and both CAD and CVD were recorded according to patient history.Median homocysteine levels in the total sample (58.0% females, mean age 72.5 years, mean body mass index 27.3 kg m-2) differed between patients with and without PAD: 15.2 micro mol L-1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 14.8 15.7, vs. 13.9 micro mol L-1 (CI: 13.8Elevated HC is only slightly more related to PAD than to CAD and CVD. After adjustment for known risk factors, the effect size is small, and an association can no longer be observed between homocysteine and CAD and CVD.
