Radial artery as conduit for distal renal artery reconstruction. Reconstruction of the renal artery with both saphenous vein and prosthetic material as bypass graft is durable in atherosclerotic disease. Extensive experience with saphenous vein grafts in pediatric patients and patients without atherosclerosis reveals a disturbing incidence of vein graft aneurysm degeneration. Distal renal artery reconstruction involving small branch vessels is generally not amenable to prosthetic reconstruction. We report a new approach to distal renal artery bypass grafting to avert these limitations.A 43-year-old man with previously normal blood pressure had malignant hypertension, which proved difficult to control despite use of a beta-blocker and an angiotensin II inhibitor. At renal angiography a fusiform aneurysm was revealed in a posterior branch of the right renal artery. The renal artery aneurysm was resected, and the left radial artery was harvested and used as a sequential aortorenal bypass graft to the two branch renal arteries. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient now has normal blood pressure with a calcium channel blocker for maintenance of the radial artery graft. Pathologic analysis revealed a pseudoaneurysm with dissection between the media and external lamella, consistent with fibromuscular dysplasia.Autologous artery is the preferred conduit for renal reconstruction in the pediatric population. On the basis of cardiac surgery experience, we used the radial artery and found it to be a technically satisfactory conduit for distal renal reconstruction in a patient without atherosclerosis.
