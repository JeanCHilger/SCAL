Arterial wall stiffness is associated with peripheral circulation in patients with type 2 diabetes. The prevalence of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) in diabetic patients is manyfold higher than that of age- and sex-matched nondiabetic subjects. This study was designed to evaluate the relationship between quantitatively determined peripheral circulation in the lower extremities and arterial wall thickness or stiffness in 68 patients with type 2 diabetes. Peripheral circulation during treadmill-exercise was monitored by transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPO2) and was expressed as percentage of post-exercise TcPO2 adjusted by that of pre-exercise (TcPO2 index). Arterial wall thickness (intima-media thickness IMT) and stiffness (stiffness beta) were measured by ultrasonography. TcPO2 index was negatively (r=-0.350, P=0.0007) correlated with stiffness beta, not with IMT, of the femoral artery. In patients without insulin therapy (n=52), both fasting plasma insulin concentration (r=-0.323, P=0.0023) and HOMA IR, an insulin resistance index, (r=-0.281, P=0.0084) were negatively correlated with TcPO2 index. Multiple regression analyses showed that association of stiffness beta of the femoral artery or HOMA IR with the TcPO2 index was independent of other factors including age, smoking index, ankle brachial pressure index and IMT of femoral artery. Thus, arterial wall stiffness of femoral artery appears to be a major determinant of peripheral circulation in patients with type 2 diabetes.
