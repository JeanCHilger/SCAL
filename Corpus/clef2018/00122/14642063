The relation between peripheral arterial occlusive disease and cardiovascular diseases in elderly population: a cross-section study in Wanshoulu area, Beijing. To investigate the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in the elderly with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) and the prevalence of PAOD in the elderly with high cardiovascular factors.A questionnaire survey was conducted, physical examination and electrocardiography were undertaken, blood pressure at the ankle artery and brachial artery was taken, and peripheral blood was drawn to determine the triglyceride, cholesterol, high density lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein, and fasting blood glucose among 2,124 persons aged 60 approximately 95 (mean age 68.54 +/- 5.43), 943 males and 1,183 females, in Wanshoulu area, Beijing. PAOD was defined as an ankle-arm index (AAI) < or = 0.9.(1) The prevalence rate of PAOD was 15.91% (16.42% after being standardized). (2) The prevalence rates of essential hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary heart disease, and diabetes mellitus in the elderly population with PAOD were 55.8%, 54.3%, 41.0%, and 25.4% respectively, among which the prevalence rates of hypertension, coronary heart disease, and diabetes were significantly higher in the population with PAOD than in the population without PAOD (P < 0.01, P < 0.05, and P < 0.05 respectively), The prevalence rates of hypertension in the female PAOD population and the prevalence rate of coronary heart disease in the male PAOD population were significantly higher than those in the populations without PAOD respectively (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01). The prevalence rate of CVD in the population with PAOD was 1.36 approximately 1.63 times higher than that in the population without PAOD. (3) The prevalence rate of PAOD was 17.55% in the elderly population with single CVD risk factor (U = 3.8661, P < 0.001), 20.33% in those with double risk factors, and 22.14% in those with triple factors (chi(2) = 7.240 8, P < 0.05) respectively.The prevalence of PAOD in Wanshoulu area is similar to that in the developed countries, suggesting that PAOD is also one of the common diseases in elderly population in China. The prevalence of CVD in the population with PAOD is significantly higher than that in the population without PAOD. The PAOD prevalence increases along with the increase of cardiovascular risk factors. PAOD in elderly population.
