Quality of life of patients with atherosclerotic lesion of lower extremity arteries as dependent on individual and typological properties of the patient personality. Twenty men with atherosclerotic lesion of lower extremity arteries verified by contrast angiography and ultrasound Doppler were examined. The patients' age varied from 36 to 69 years (mean 57 years). Six patients had IIB ischemia, 13 presented with degree III and one patient had degree IV ischemia according to the R. Fontaine classification modified by A. V. Pokrovsky. The MOS SF = 36 questionnaire was used to estimate the quality of life of all the patients. The individual typological properties of the personality were defined using the psychodiagnostic test (PDT). A significant decrease of the patients' quality of life was revealed according to the scales: physical function, physical role, physical pain, general health condition. A correlation was recorded between the patient's age and the parameters of the "physical function scale" (r=-0.63 p<0.005). The individual typological properties of the personality exert an effect on five of the eight SF = 36 scales. A feedback was discovered between neurotism and mental health (r=-0.455
