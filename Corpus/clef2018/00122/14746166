Antioxidant enzymes activity in patients with peripheral vascular disease, with and without presence of diabetes mellitus. The study evaluated antioxidant status in patients with peripheral vascular disease (PVD), with and without concomitant diabetes mellitus (DM). 211 participants were divided into standardized 4 groups: patients with PVD and DM (PVD+DM+), patients with PVD without DM (PVD+DM-), patients without PVD with DM (PVD-DM+) and patients without PVD and DM (PVD-DM-). The diagnosis of PVD was established by Doppler sonography analysis, including determination of the ankle brachial index (ABI), partial pressures along the leg, and CW Doppler sonography at typical locations. Antioxidant status has been evaluated through the colorimetrically assessed serum activity of key antioxidant enzymes: superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase (GLPX) as well as through total antioxidant status (TAS) determination. In PVD+DM- group, as well as PVD-DM+ group, a significantly lower activity of the GLPX, catalase and TAS was found, whereas activity of SOD was significantly higher. There was no statistically significant difference between PVD+DM+ and PVD-DM+ group. Likewise, there was no statistically significant difference between PVD+DM- and PVD-DM-group. This study has shown that there is statistically significant difference in activity of antioxidant enzymes between diabetic and non-diabetic patients, irrespectively of PVD presence. Furthermore, PVD present alone does not alter key antioxidant enzymes activity in comparison with healthy subjects.
