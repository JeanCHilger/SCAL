Off-pump mitral valve repair using the Coapsys device: a pilot study in a pacing-induced mitral regurgitation model. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of the Myocor Coapsys device to restore leaflet apposition and valve competency off-pump in a canine model of functional mitral regurgitation (MR).The Coapsys device was surgically implanted in 10 dogs after MR induction by rapid ventricular pacing. The Coapsys consists of anterior and posterior epicardial pads connected by a subvalvular chord. The annular head of the posterior pad was positioned at the annular level to draw the posterior leaflet and annulus toward the anterior leaflet. Final device size was selected when MR was minimized or eliminated as assessed by color flow Doppler echocardiography.All implants were placed off-pump without atriotomy, and mean MR grade was reduced from 2.9 +/- 0.7 to 0.6 +/- 0.7 (p < 0.001) acutely. No hemodynamic compromise was noted.The Coapsys device consistently and significantly reduced or eliminated functional MR acutely. Further study will be required to assess the chronic stability of the repair in this animal model.
