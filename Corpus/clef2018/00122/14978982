Colour Doppler flow imaging findings in portal biliopathy. Biliary abnormalities in extrahepatic portal vein obstruction (EHPVO) have been described in detail on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP), but have never before been reported on colour Doppler flow imaging (CDFI). These changes occur either due to extrinsic compression of the bile ducts or due to ischaemic biliary stenosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of CDFI in demonstrating the biliary changes in patients with EHPVO. Three out of 46 patients with EHPVO (7%), who presented clinically with obstructive jaundice, were subjected to a detailed CDFI study of the abdomen, followed by ERCP and splenoportovenography (SPV). One of the patients also underwent a repeat CDFI examination at 8 weeks following a lienorenal shunt. In all 3 cases, CDFI easily distinguished the anechoeic structures seen on ultrasound at the porta hepatis as periportal collaterals, the hepatic artery and dilated bile ducts. It revealed the actual indentation made on the common bile duct (CBD) by the collaterals besides showing the presence of biliary calculi. Gallbladder varices were also well demonstrated in all the cases. ERCP confirmed the presence of portal biliopathy besides showing other changes, such as angulation, displacement and stricture of the CBD. SPV confirmed the presence of EHPVO. One patient who underwent shunt surgery showed persistent dilatation of the CBD with calculi. CDFI is a rapid, non-invasive and widely available modality which can be used to demonstrate the biliary changes in patients with EHPVO with obstructive jaundice. It may thus help screen patients who require a further by ERCP examination for the planning of treatment.
