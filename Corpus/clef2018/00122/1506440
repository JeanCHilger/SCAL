Repeated negative DC deflections in rat cortex following middle cerebral artery occlusion are abolished by MK-801: effect on volume of ischemic injury. Following permanent occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) in rats, electrophysiological and hemodynamic characteristics of the periinfarct border zone were investigated in sham-operated (n = 6), untreated (n = 6), and MK-801-treated (3.0 mg/kg n = 6) animals. For this purpose, direct current potential (DC), EEG, and blood flow (laser-Doppler flowmetry) were recorded from the cortex in the periphery of the MCA territory. In sham-operated rats, a single negative cortical DC deflection was observed after electrocoagulation of the cortex, whereas in untreated MCA-occluded animals, three to eight transient DC deflections were monitored during the initial 3 h of ischemia. The duration of these cortical DC shifts gradually increased from 1.2 +/- 0.3 to 3.7 +/- 2.7 min (mean +/- SD
