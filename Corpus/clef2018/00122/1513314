99mTC-HSA lymphoscintigraphy and leg edema after arterial reconstruction. To investigate the etiology of lower limb edema after arterial reconstruction, 12 patients (16 limbs) who underwent arterial reconstruction due to atherosclerosis obliterans were observed. There was no relationship between the severity of limb edema and serum factors (serum total protein, albumin, BUN and creatinine), ankle/brachial arterial pressure ratio, peripheral venous pressure or RI lymphoscintigraphy in the supine position. The lymphatic flow in RI lymphoscintigraphy at 3-4 weeks after operation increased with statistically significant difference compared to the preoperative flow whether the patient was in the supine or upright position. Though there was no significant relationship between the severity of leg edema and postoperative lymphatic flow in the supine position, postoperative lymphatic flow in the upright position decreased as the severity of leg edema increased. Increased lymphatic flow in the follow-up period was associated with increased severity of leg edema in the upright position. It is concluded that postoperative leg edema is due to the damage to the lymphatic vessels during operation, and then the lymphatic channels cannot adapt to the increased lymphatic flow after the arterial reconstruction.
