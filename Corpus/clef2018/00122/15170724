Bioptome-assisted coil occlusion of moderate-large patent ductus arteriosus in infants and small children. Coil occlusion of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), although inexpensive, is technically challenging for the moderate-large ducts in small children. Bioptome assistance allows better control and precision. We describe case selection strategies, technique, immediate and short-term results of bioptome-assisted closure of moderate-large (>/= 3 mm) PDA in 86 infants and children </= 10 kg (age, 18 days to 3 years median, 8 months
