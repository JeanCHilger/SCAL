Effects of midodrine on exercise-induced hypotension and blood pressure recovery in autonomic failure. We tested the hypothesis that the oral alpha1-adrenergic agonist, midodrine, would limit the fall in arterial pressure observed during exercise in patients with pure autonomic failure (PAF). Fourteen subjects with PAF underwent a stand test, incremental supine cycling exercise (25, 50, and 75 W), and ischemic calf exercise, before (control) and 1 h after ingesting 10 mg midodrine. Heart rate (ECG), beat-to-beat blood pressure (MAP, arterial catheter), cardiac output (Q, open-circuit acetylene breathing), forearm blood flow (FBF, Doppler ultrasound), and calf blood flow (CBF, venous occlusion plethysmography) were measured. The fall in MAP after standing for 2 min was similar ( approximately 60 mmHg P = 0.62). Supine MAP immediately before cycling was greater after midodrine (124 +/- 6 vs 117 +/- 6 mmHg
