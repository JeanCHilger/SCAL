Impaired endothelial function in young women with premature ovarian failure: normalization with hormone therapy. Normal menopause is associated with vascular endothelial dysfunction, an early stage of atherosclerosis. The effect of premature ovarian failure (or premature menopause) on endothelial function in young women is unknown. Endothelial function was assessed in 18 women with premature ovarian failure before and after 6 months of hormone therapy and was compared with the endothelial function of 20 age- and body mass index-matched premenopausal women. Brachial artery diameter was measured both during hyperemia (an index of endothelium-dependent vasodilation) and in response to glyceryl trinitrate (an index of endothelium-independent vaso-dilation). Flow-mediated dilation was significantly lower in women with premature ovarian failure at baseline (increase in brachial artery diameter during hyperemia by 3.06 +/- 4.33%) than in control women (increase by 8.84 +/- 2.15% P < 0.0005). Glyceryl trinitrate-induced vasodilation did not differ between the groups. After hormone therapy for 6 months, flow-mediated dilation was improved in women with premature ovarian failure, increasing by more than 2-fold (7.41 +/- 3.86%
