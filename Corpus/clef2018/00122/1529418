Maximal blood flow after exercise in patients with intermittent claudication and in normal controls. In some patients with intermittent claudication blood flow to the calf muscles after exercise was in the same range as in normals. The blood pressure was lower in all patients. The hypothesis is formulated that for these high flow patients the claudication is a result of non-uniform perfusion of the calf muscles.
