Transcutaneous oxygen pressure in the foot in treadmill stress before and after percutaneous atherectomy. Transcutaneous oxygen pressure (tcPO2) on the dorsum of the foot and Doppler ankle/arm pressure ratio (AAR) were measured in nine patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD)-stage IIb-III during treadmill exercise before and after (two days and one month) atherectomy. These parameters were compared with nine normal controls and nine PAOD I-IIa patients without atherectomy. All patients with atherectomy showed an increase in their pain free walking distance, and, both two days and one month after the intervention, a significant (p less than 0.05) increase in their exercise/rest tcPO2 ratio (pre-atherectomy: 25% (12-81), two days after: 78% (49-92), one month after: 85% (81-92). AAR displays a significant increase only between pre- and two days after atherectomy, without further significant improvement after one month. We conclude that tcPO2 measurement is an adequate measurement for follow-up studies in patients with PAOD after invasive therapeutic interventions. Furthermore, these data suggest that, while the maximum improvement for the macrocirculation (AAR) occurs shortly after atherectomy, improvement of the microcirculation (tcPO2) is delayed for a prolonged period after revascularization of major arteries, possibly due to reperfusion injury.
