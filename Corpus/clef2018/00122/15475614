The role of shear stress in atherosclerosis: action through gene expression and inflammation? Atherosclerotic lesions preferentially localize near side branches or curved vessels. During the last few decades, research has been shown that low or low and oscillating shear stress is associated with plaque location. Despite ample evidence, the precise mechanism is unknown. This is mainly because of a lack of appropriate animal models. We describe two novel methods to study the hypothesis that shear stress acts through endothelial gene expression or shear stress acts through localizing of inflammation. Both literature evidence and own findings support a role for both mechanisms in atherosclerosis.
