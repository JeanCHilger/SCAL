Color Doppler ultrasound of the genitourinary tract. This paper discusses the role of color Doppler ultrasonography (CDU) as it applies to the genitourinary tract. CDU is beneficial in evaluating both the native and allograft kidney in the diagnosis of renal arterial and venous stenosis, arteriovenous fistulas, pseudoaneurysms, arterial and venous thrombosis, and in the characterization and staging of renal masses. CDU has redefined the role of ultrasonography in the evaluation of the scrotum as it relates to testicular torsion, inflammatory disorders and varicoceles. Early results of CDU in prostate carcinoma and benign prostate hypertrophy have shown limited success. Identifying and assessing the neurovascular bundle may have an impact on the staging of prostate carcinoma. It is hoped that the future addition of ultrasound contrast agents will further establish the role of color Doppler in the diagnosis of a variety of genitourinary diseases and disorders.
