The clinical and urodynamic effects of the tension free bladder neck sling procedure. This study evaluated the clinical and urodynamic findings before and after tension-free bladder neck sling (TBS) procedure with Prolene tape. We enrolled 32 women who underwent TBS for genuine stress incontinence without intrinsic sphincter deficiency or severe uterovaginal prolapse. All subjects received 1-h pad test, Q-tip test, multichannel urodynamic testing, introital ultrasonography, and the Bristol Female Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Questionnaires before and 1 year after surgery. Of the 32 subjects 27 were cured of stress incontinence, two improved, and three failed. The incidence of irritative symptoms and incomplete bladder emptying were significantly lower after surgery. The mean urethral straining angle showed a significant decrease from 73.8 degrees preoperatively to 30.1 degrees postoperatively. At rest the postsurgical position of the bladder neck (BN) was localized more cranially. During straining both ventral and caudal mobility of the BN decreased significantly following TBS, causing a more cranial and dorsal position of the BN. Urodynamic parameters including functional urethral length, maximal urethral closure pressure, and pressure transmission ratio showed significant increases after surgery. TBS could decrease the hypermobility of the BN and restore the BN support to prevent urinary leakage during straining, instead of urethral obstruction. The subjective and objective cure rate of stress incontinence is 84%, similar to those results reported after retropubic urethropexy and tension-free vaginal tape procedure. It is also worth emphasizing that no postoperative urinary retention occurred, although the limited number of cases makes it hard to confirm the significance of findings over the retention rate of tension-free vaginal tape.
