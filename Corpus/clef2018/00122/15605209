Nailfold video-capillaroscopy in systemic sclerosis. The Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) is the most common and significant clinical condition supporting microvascular analysis as soon as possible. Microvascular involvement is a key feature of RP, and several rheumatic diseases are characterized by the presence of the RP. Nailfold capillary microscopy shows an impressive cost/effectiveness ratio: it is simple, noninvasive and inexpensive.Well-recognized videocapillaroscopic patterns (NVC) have been described mainly in scleroderma (SSc) patients complaining of a secondary RP. The peripheral microvascular damage in SSc is characterized by increasing structural alterations of the capillaries (giant capillaries and microhemorrhages) with progressive decrease of their density. The detection of the scleroderma NCV allows early differentiation between primary RP (functional, not disease associated), and secondary RP (disease associated). Other major NVC patterns have been described in the field of rheumatic diseases. Interestingly, correlations are evident between the NCV and the clinical symptoms, severity of the disease and the laboratory findings. Further clinical and epidemiological studies, as well as a standardized and computerized quantitation of the observed damages are required.
