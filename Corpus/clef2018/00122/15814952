Reappraisal of flow velocity ratio in common carotid artery to predict hemodynamic change in carotid stenosis. Various Doppler criteria have been used to predict hemodynamically significant carotid stenosis. This study was performed to elucidate whether hemodynamically significant stenosis can be predicted indirectly by the blood flow velocity in the common carotid artery (CCA) measured with duplex ultrasonography in patients with unilateral stenosis of internal carotid artery (ICA).Eighty-five patients who were scheduled to undergo carotid endarterectomy for unilateral stenosis of ICA origin were analyzed. The flow velocities and their side-to-side ratios in the CCA were calculated. The flow velocities in the CCA were measured with conventional ultrasonography and poststenotic blood flow with transoral carotid ultrasonography. Cerebral angiography was performed to evaluate the intracranial collateral flow.Among the absolute values and side-to-side ratios of Doppler flow velocities in the CCA, the end diastolic flow velocity (EDV) ratio in the CCA best correlated with the residual lumen area (r = 0.35 P = .0009), stenosis of diameter (r = 0.48The EDV ratio in the CCA appears to be an additional parameter for predicting hemodynamically significant stenosis in patients with unilateral ICA stenosis.
