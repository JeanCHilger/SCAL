Early arterial atherosclerosis and level of plasma homocysteine in simply obese children. To understand whether hyperhomocysteinemia and early arterial atherosclerosis exist in simply obese children.Totally 68 simply obese children (age 6-14 years, mean 10.8 +/- 2.3 years) were enrolled in this study, 50 were male and 18 were female. Body mass index (BMI) of the obese children was equal to or more than 22. The height of the children was (145 +/- 22) cm. Meanwhile, 26 normal children (age 6 - 14 years, mean 10.9 +/- 2.0 years) were selected as control group, 17 of these children were male and 9 were female. Their height was (148.5 +/- 5.8) cm. There were no significant differences in height and age between the obese and the control children. The carotid intimal-medial thickness (IMT), brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation were examined by Doppler Flow/Dimension System and the liver was examined by B-mode ultrasound imager. Plasma homocysteine was determined by the automated chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassays. Serum lipid concentration was determined by biochemical analytic method. Blood pressure of the right upper limbs was measured. A detailed medical and family history was systematically recorded.BMI was (27.8 +/- 4.5) in the obese children and (16.2 +/- 2.5) in the controls. There was significant difference between two groups (P < 0.01). The obese children had significantly increased values than the controls for the carotid intimal-medial thickness (P < 0.01). Right carotid IMT, right inner-carotid IMT, left carotid IMT and left inner-carotid IMT were respectively (0.54 +/- 0.13) mm, (0.69 +/- 0.14) mm, (0.52 +/- 0.12) mm and (0.67 +/- 0.14) mm in obese children and were respectively (0.45 +/- 0.04) mm, (0.46 +/- 0.04) mm, (0.45 +/- 0.05) mm and (0.46 +/- 0.03) mm in control groups. Conversely, the flow-mediated brachial artery dilation of the obese children was significantly lower than that of the controls [(11.0 +/- 4.3)% vs. (17.5 +/- 4.9)%, P < 0.01]. The obese children had higher level of plasma homocysteine than the controls [(7.9 +/- 2.7) micromol/L vs. (5.6 +/- 2.1) micromol/L, P < 0.01]. Total cholesterol (TC) in the obese children dramatically increased, so did triglyceride concentration (TG), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-ch) and apolipoprotein-B (apo-B). Of the obese children, had fatty liver or the tendency to fatty liver. Six cases of the 68 obese children (8%) had hypertension. Of the 68 obese children, 57 (84%) had the history of consuming excessive food or taking less exercise. Forty-four percent of the obese children (30/68) came from the obese families in which at least one of the parents or grandparents was obese. Twenty-nine percent (20/68) and 22% (15/68) of the obese children respectively came from the families in which at least one of the parents or grandparents suffered from hypertension or coronary heart disease.Early arterial atherosclerotic changes existed in simply obese children. Hyperhomocysteinemia may be an important factor of the obesity-induced early arterial atherosclerosis during childhood.
