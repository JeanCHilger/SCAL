Colour Doppler ultrasound assessment of well-functioning mature arteriovenous fistulas for haemodialysis access. A well-functioning mature arteriovenous fistula is essential for the maintenance of haemodialysis in patients with chronic renal failure. The Brescia-Cimino arteriovenous fistula has the best survival characteristics and low rate of complications. The most common reason of fistula failure is thrombosis caused by stenosis. Colour Doppler ultrasonography has proven to be effective in the assessment of anatomical vascular features. The majority of studies were done in patients with clinically presumed arteriovenous fistula complications. However, only limited data are available about the well-functioning mature arteriovenous fistulas. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate completely asymptomatic, mature arteriovenous fistulas with colour Doppler ultrasound.From July 2001 to April 2003, we examined 139 patients with the end-stage renal disease. They were in the range of 19-79 years of age (mean, 46.7 years). The study included only the patients who met the following criteria: (1) no difficulties with haemodialysis (as reported by nurses) (2) normal venous diastolic blood pressure (<150 mmHg) at monthly evaluationThere was no correlation between: (1) patient's age and fistula age (2) patient's age and number of fistulas in one patientWe conclude that there was a high level of abnormalities present in well-functioning mature arteriovenous fistulas. However, these abnormalities were not sufficient to affect the functioning of the dialysis fistula.
