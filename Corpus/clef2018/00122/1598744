Arteriovenous fistulas in renal transplants: color Doppler ultrasound observations. One hundred twenty-six new renal transplants were scanned regularly with color Doppler ultrasound (CDU). In 22 (17.5%) of the grafts there was evidence of postbiopsy arteriovenous (AV) fistula during the first 6 months postoperatively. In 14 cases the fistula closed spontaneously. In the remaining eight, the fistula was still present up to 24 months later (four cases) or until the graft failed (four cases). Additionally, 163 established grafts were scanned for evidence of vascular abnormality. AV fistulas were observed in 15 grafts (8%). Circulatory complications of fistulas observed include vascular steal and a possible association with graft vein and artery stenosis.
