Prophylaxis, diagnosis and conservative treatment of chronic lower extremities ischaemia. The most frequent cause underlying the chronic lower extremities ischaemia is atheromatosis. As the basic symptom of the disease, intermittent claudication exerts essential impact upon the state of patient's health as it causes the limitation or the loss of the ability of unassisted walking and, effectively, also the deterioration of the quality of his or her life. The discovery of the etiopathogenesis of atheromatosis and correct assessment of risk factors involved are the elementary conditions of proper administering of pharmacological treatment as well as the basis for adequate planning of necessary prophylactic steps. In such cases, the diagnostic process ought to involve obtaining data from the patient's medical history and his or her physical examination, as well as determining his or her ankle-brachial index (ABI) and information derived from ultrasonographic examination performed at non-invasive diagnostics laboratory. The resultant treatment ought to focus on the improvement of the patient's functional efficiency. Before the necessity of surgical treatment is considered it is recommended to determine a plan for conservative treatment. Adequate diagnosis combined with an early commencement of conservative treatment in the cases of chronic lower extremities ischaemia frequently prove effective in arresting the development of the disease and, consequently, render invasive treatment unnecessary--thus resulting in the improvement of patient's quality of life.
