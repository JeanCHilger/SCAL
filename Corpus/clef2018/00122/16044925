Comparison of results in endovascular interventions for infrainguinal lesions: claudication versus critical limb ischemia. This study analyzed clinical success, patency, and limb salvage after endovascular repair in patients treated for chronic limb ischemia presenting with claudication versus critical limb ischemia. Between October 2001 and August 2004, 115 patients (mean age 71) underwent endovascular treatment for infrainguinal arterial disease. Techniques included subintimal angioplasty and transluminal angioplasty with or without stents. Lesions were classified according to Transatlantic InterSociety Consensus. Follow-up (mean 11 months) included physical exam, ankle-brachial index, and duplex ultrasound. Patency rates were determined using Kaplan-Meier and compared by log-rank analysis. One hundred ninety-nine lesions were treated in 121 limbs using percutaneous techniques. Comorbidities were similar except higher rates of diabetes mellitus (67% vs 41%, P < 0.001) and chronic renal insufficiency (22% vs 7%, P < 0.05) were found in critical limb ischemia patients. Primary patency for claudicants was 100 per cent, 98 per cent, and 85 per cent at 3, 6, and 12 months and 89 per cent, 80 per cent, and 72 per cent for critical limb ischemia, respectively (P = 0.06). Limb salvage was 91 per cent at 12 months for critical limb ischemia patients. Morbidity was similar between groups, and there was no perioperative mortality. Percutaneous intervention for both claudication and critical limb ischemia provides acceptable 12 month patency with limited morbidity.
