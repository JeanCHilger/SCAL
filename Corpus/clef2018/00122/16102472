The importance of obtaining ankle-brachial indexes in older adults: the other vital sign. As the aging population increases, so does the need to identify specific health problems associated with that age group and to develop and implement strategies to manage those problems efficiently. Peripheral arterial disease, a known threat to older adults' health and independence, often leads to decreased functional ability and potential limb loss. Nurses are in a unique position to screen older adults for the disease and to implement strategies to manage the problem. An overview of arterial physiology will be presented along with identification of risk factors, how to obtain ankle-brachial indexes and interpret the results, and treatment options for mild, moderate, and severe disease. Identifying the disease in its early stages and minimizing the effects will help keep older adults living independently and improve their quality of life.
