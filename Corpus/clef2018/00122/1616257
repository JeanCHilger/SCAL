Should we palpate foot pulses? Palpation of foot pulses is traditionally used to evaluate patients with arterial disease. This study investigated observer variation in assessment of pedal vessels by pulse palpation and Doppler auscultation. A series of 33 claudicant patients and five controls were examined by a consultant, registrar, SHO and nurse. Dorsalis pedis (DP) and posterior tibial (PT) pulses were palpated and were then examined by Doppler with measurement of systolic pressures.No disagreement in DP pulses. However, all observers agreed on the presence of a PT pulse in only 70% of limbs. Claudicants: There was better agreement in palpation of the DP pulse (all observers agreed in 67% of limbs), than the PT pulse (all agreed in 53%). This suggests that the DP pulse is easier to palpate than the PT (P less than 0.05). By contrast there was better agreement on Doppler signals from the PT artery, all agreed in 78% of limbs compared with the DP artery, all agreed in 58% (P less than 0.01). Pressure measurements by the observers agreed to within +/- 0.15 in 88% of claudicant and 100% of control limbs. Pedal pulse palpation in patients with arterial disease is subject to substantial observer error. Doppler pressure measurement is preferable unless pulses are bounding.
