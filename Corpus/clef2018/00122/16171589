Long-term outcomes and predictors of iliac angioplasty with selective stenting. To review our 11-year experience of iliac angioplasty with selective stenting and to evaluate the safety, short- and long-term patency, clinical success rates, and predictive risk factors in patients with iliac artery occlusive disease.From August 1993 to November 2004, 151 iliac lesions (149 stenoses, 2 occlusions) in 104 patients were treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). The patients had chronic limb ischemia described as disabling claudication (the Society for Vascular Surgery clinical category 2 or 3) in 76 (50%), rest pain (category 4) in 38 (25%), and ulcer/gangrene (category 5) in 37 (25%). Forty-six limbs (30%) were treated with concomitant infrainguinal endovascular (36, 24%) or open procedures (10, 6%). Thirty-four limbs (23%) had one or more stents placed for primary PTA failure, including residual stenosis (> or =30%), mean pressure gradient (> or =5 mm Hg), or dissection (stent group) whereas, 117 limbs (77%) underwent PTA alone (PTA group). The affected arteries treated were 28 (19%) common iliac, 31 (20%) external iliac, and 92 (61%) both arteries. According to TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) classification, 39 limbs (26%) were in type A, 71 (47%) in type B, 36 (24%) in type C, and 5 (3%) in type D. Reporting standards of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery were followed.There was no perioperative death. Total complication rate was 0.7% (one groin hematoma). The mean follow-up was 21 months (median, 10 range, 1 to 94 months). Only 9 (8%) of 117 of the PTA group had subsequent stent placement for recurrent stenosis. The iliac lesions were more severe and extensive in the stent group than those in the PTA group according to TASC classification (Mann-Whitney U test [M-W], P < .0001) and anatomic location (M-W, P = .0019). The technical success rate was 99%, and the initial clinical success rate was 99%. Overall, the cumulative primary patency rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 76%, 59%, and 49% (Kaplan-Meier [K-M]). The cumulative assisted primary and secondary patency rates at 7 years were 98% and 99% (K-M). The mean number of subsequent iliac endovascular procedures was 1.4 per limb in patients with primary failure of iliac angioplasty/stenting. The continued clinical improvement rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 81%, 67%, and 53% (K-M). The limb salvage rates at 7 year were 93% (K-M). Of 15 predictor variables studied in 151 iliac lesions, the significant independent predictors for adverse outcomes were smoking history (P = .0074), TASC type C/type D lesions (P = .0001), and stenotic ipsilateral superficial femoral artery (P = .0002) for the primary patency ratesAlthough the primary patency rates were not high, the assisted primary and secondary patency rates were excellent without primary stenting. Overall, >70% of iliac lesions were treated successfully with PTA alone. The results of this study show that selective stenting offers satisfactory assisted primary and secondary long-term patency after iliac angioplasty. Patients with TASC type C/type D iliac lesions, a stenotic ipsilateral superficial femoral artery, ulcer/gangrene, smoking history, and chronic renal failure with hemodialysis should be followed carefully after endovascular iliac revascularization. These risk factors could be considered indications for primary stenting, although further studies are needed to confirm this.
