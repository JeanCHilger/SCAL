Ten-year Echo-Doppler evaluation of forearm circulation following radial artery removal for coronary artery bypass grafting. To investigate the chronic consequences of radial artery removal for coronary artery bypass surgery on the forearm circulation.Thirty-nine patients submitted to radial artery removal for coronary artery bypass were submitted to serial Echo-Doppler evaluation of the flow and morphology of the forearm arteries until 10 years follow-up.The peak systolic velocity of the ulnar artery of the operated side was significantly higher than the control site. The intima-media thickness of the ulnar artery was always significantly higher on the operated side, and this difference reached statistical significance at 10 years follow-up. There was a significantly higher prevalence of atherosclerotic plaques in the ulnar artery (UA) of the operated versus control arm (11/39 vs 0/39 p=0.005).Radial artery removal for coronary artery bypass surgery leads to a chronic increase in ulnar flow accompanied by increased intima-media thickness and accelerated atherosclerotic disease. These findings may have potentially important implications for surgical indications and patients management.
