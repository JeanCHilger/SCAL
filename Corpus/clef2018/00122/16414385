The constitutive procoagulant and hypofibrinolytic state in patients with intermittent claudication due to infrainguinal disease significantly improves with percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty. Patients with intermittent lower limb claudication (IC) exhibit a prothrombotic diathesis that is acutely exacerbated by exercise. This may occur because of ischemia/reperfusion injury within the leg muscles during walking and may contribute to the increased risk of thrombotic vascular events in this group of patients. This randomized study compared the effect of lower limb revascularization by percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty (PTA), supervised exercise, and best medical therapy (BMT) alone on this prothrombotic state.Twenty-three patients (16 men and 7 women median age, 67 yearsAt 6 months, subjects randomized to BMT plus PTA demonstrated a significant improvement in ankle-brachial pressure index (P = .013) and maximal walking distance (P = .008), a significant decline in resting thrombin generation (median [interquartile range] TAT, 6.4 microg/L [2.7-13.5 microg/L] to 1.5 microg/L [0.3-2.9 microg/L] P = .038), and an improvement in resting fibrinolysis (median [interquartile range] PAI-1, 10.0 ng/mL [1.0-20.5 ng/mL] to 1.0 ng/mL [1.0-14.8 ng/mL]The addition of lower limb revascularization by PTA to BMT in patients with IC due to infra-inguinal disease results in a medium-term improvement in the resting procoagulant and hypofibrinolytic state. This may translate into a reduction in morbidity and mortality from thrombotic vascular events in this group of patients.
