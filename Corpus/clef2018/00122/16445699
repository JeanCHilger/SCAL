Effects of N-acetyl-L-cysteine on renal haemodynamics and function in early ischaemia-reperfusion injury in rats. 1. Renal ischaemia-reperfusion (IR) severely compromises kidney function and has been shown to cause persistent abnormalities in intrarenal blood flow. The aim of the present study was to examine whether N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a thiol-containing anti-oxidant, improves renal haemodynamics and function during early reperfusion in rats subjected to renal IR. 2. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into groups receiving either isotonic saline (IR-Saline n = 8) or NAC (IR-NAC
