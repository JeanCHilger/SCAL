Improvement of walking disturbance by beraprost sodium in rat femoral artery occlusion models. In rats receiving bilateral femoral arteries ligation (day 0), repeated oral administration of the prostacyclin derivative beraprost sodium (50 microg/kg, b.i.d.) from day 1 to day 5 resulted in a significant prolongation in walking time in rotarod walking exercise performed on day 5. Similarly, results were obtained in rats with bilateral femoral arterial thrombosis induced by application of FeCl(3)/HCl. In the ligation model, a significant increase was observed in femoral/carotid arterial blood pressure ratio even on day 2. These results indicated that beraprost sodium improves blood flow and walking disturbances associated with arterial occlusion in rats.
