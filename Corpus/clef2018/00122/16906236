Markers predicting progression of disease in PAD: Which of them are both relevant to clinical practice and economically justifiable?. The high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality on peripheral arterial disease (PAD) are attributable to the pronounced tendency to generalization of the atherosclerotic process, the systemic progression of atherosclerosis. The crucial objective in management of a PAD consists in preventing systemic progression. The prognosis can be improved by early diagnosis and early prediction of individual risk with subsequent risk-adapted prevention and causal therapy. Early diagnosis and risk prediction are measures that are already part of the repertory of the general practitioner. Practicable and economically justifiable parameters that nevertheless have a high predictive value are therefore required to stratify individual risk. The vascular indicators ankle-arm index and the localization of the PAD as well as the classical cardiovascular risk factors including homocysteine are suitable. Weighting of these parameters in a multivariable risk score enable the population with the highest risk of early generalization of atherosclerosis to be identified in PAD.
