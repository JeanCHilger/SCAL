Ultrasonic endarterectomy for long superficial femoral artery atherosclerotic occlusive disease. To report the long term results of ultrasonic superficial femoral artery endarterectomy (USFAE).Retrospective study.From January 1998 to June 2004 218 USFAE were performed in 202 selected patients (178 males, 192 procedures) with a median age of 65 years (46-87 years). Indications for operation were disabling intermittent claudication in 137 procedures (68%), rest pain in 24 procedures (12%), and limb salvage in 41 procedures (20%). The new medical technology of ultrasonic endarterectomy is based on the application of the mechanical vibrations in the range of low frequency ultrasound. The ultrasonic device consists of the ultrasonic generator, acoustic unit and the flexible wave concentrators with special working tips in the shape of a ring. Follow up consisted of clinical evaluation, ankle-brachial index measurements and duplex scanning.The mean follow-up time was 30.1 months. The mean length of the endarterectomised SFAs was 29 cm (range, 15-43 cm). The five year cumulative primary patency rate by means of life table analysis was 45.8 +/- 4.4% (SE). Percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty and surgical re-interventions were performed in thirty three and five patients respectively resulting in a primary assisted patency rate of 57.5 +/- 4.1%. The five year secondary patency rate was 65.6 +/- 3.8%. Limb salvage was achieved in 35 of the 41 patients with gangrene.The long term results of ultrasonic SFA endarterectomy suggest this is an effective technique.
