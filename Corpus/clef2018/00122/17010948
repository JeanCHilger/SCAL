Improved regional cerebral blood flow is important for the protection seen in a mouse model of late phase ischemic preconditioning. Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) induces protection to cerebral ischemia. However, it was previously unclear whether this protection resulted from altered susceptibility to ischemia. The current study examines the effects of late phase ischemic preconditioning in a mouse model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Specific examination of the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was conducted.Intra-abdominal radiofrequency probes were implanted in animals and core temperature was regulated. Mice were subjected to MCAO: (1) brief 15 min duration (preconditioning ischemia) and (2) 45 min MCAO (injurious ischemia). Naive (i.e. not preconditioned) animals were compared with preconditioned animals (preconditioning ischemia plus injurious ischemia at 72 h reperfusion). rCBF was measured using laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) and magnetic resonance cerebral perfusion (MRP) arterial spin labeling. Percentage of brain infarcted was compared between groups.rCBF was significantly improved in the preconditioned cohorts of mice. Naive animals showed flow reductions to 16+/-3.59% (MCAO_45 injurious, unpreconditioned) and 17.1+/-8.6% (MCAO_15Improved rCBF is an important factor in the protection of IPC, during injurious MCAO in the mouse. Stringent monitoring of rCBF is required in future studies of IPC.
