Long-term results after directional atherectomy of femoro-popliteal lesions. Our objective in this research was the evaluation of the long-term results after directional atherectomy using the Silverhawk device (FoxHollow Technologies, Redwood City, California) of femoro-popliteal lesions.Considering reports on stent fractures in femoro-popliteal arteries, atherectomy may be a valuable alternative to stenting.Eighty-four patients with 100 legs and 131 lesions with peripheral occlusive disease Rutherford categories 2 to 5 were included in a prospective registry. Forty-five lesions were de novo lesions (group 1 34%), 43 lesions native vessel restenoses (group 2Technical success rate was 86% for atherectomy only and 100% after additional therapy. Mean lesion length was 43 +/- 54 mm, 105 +/- 122 mm, and 131 +/- 111 mm for group 1, group 2, and group 3, respectively (p < 0.001). Primary patency, defined as freedom of a >50% restenosis detected by duplex, was 84%, 54%, and 54% at 12 months (p = 0.002) and 73%, 42%, and 49%, at 18 months (p = 0.008) secondary patency rates were 100%, 93%, and 91% at 12 months (p = NS) and 89%, 67%, and 79% at 18 months (p = 0.001), respectivelyLong-term technical and clinical results after directional atherectomy of femoro-popliteal lesions are in favor of de novo lesions compared with restenotic lesions.
