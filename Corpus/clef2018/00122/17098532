Long-term effects of endovascular angioplasty on orthostatic vasocutaneous autoregulation in patients with peripheral atherosclerosis. To test the hypothesis that endovascular revascularization of femoropopliteal lesions improves the impaired venoarteriolar response (VAR) in patients with atherosclerosis.We prospectively compared VARs in 15 healthy controls (18 legs) and 14 patients (17 legs) with mild to moderate peripheral arterial disease before and after successful peripheral endovascular angioplasty of femoropopliteal lesions. In all subjects, foot skin blood flow was assessed by laser Doppler flowmetry in the horizontal (HBF) and sitting (SBF) positions. VAR was calculated as (HBF - SBF)/HBF x 100.In patients with peripheral arterial disease, mean HBF (in arbitrary units [AU] mean +/- SD) was similar before (25.6 +/- 15.3 AU) and after (27.0 +/- 16.4 AU) angioplasty (P = .67), whereas SBF was significantly lower after than before the endovascular procedure (11.6 +/- 7.7 AU to 18.4 +/- 14.1 AUPatients with mild to moderate peripheral arterial disease have an impaired orthostatic autoregulation that improves after successful endovascular revascularization of femoropopliteal obstructive lesions. The effect on VAR is sustained in the absence of restenosis.
