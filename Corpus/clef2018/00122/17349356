Medical benefits of a peripheral vascular screening program. We present preliminary results and analysis of a screening program that has been offered at a community-based hospital since July 2004. The program includes a quick carotid ultrasound study, abdominal aortic ultrasound imaging, and measurement of bilateral ankle/brachial indices (ABI). From July 2004 through January 2006, 1,719 patients were screened, including 1,094 (64%) women and 652 (36%) men. The majority of carotid screens were normal however, 28.9% (497 patients) had 15-40% stenosis, 1.4% (24 patients) had 40-60% stenosis, and 0.3% (six patients) had >60% stenosis. Sixteen patients (1%) had infrarenal aortic dilation (>3 cm), and an abnormal ABI (<0.90) was detected in at least one limb in 100 patients (5.8%). No procedures resulted from carotid screening
