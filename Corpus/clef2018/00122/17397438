Prevalence of peripheral arterial disease and risk factors in persons aged 60 and older: data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2004. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is associated with significant cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The study objectives were to examine the prevalence of PAD and associated risk factors.A cross-sectional nationally representative health examination survey.The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2004.Data from 3,947 men and women aged 60 and older who received a lower extremity examination.The main outcome was PAD, defined as an ankle-brachial blood pressure index of less than 0.9 in either leg.In older U.S. adults, PAD prevalence was 12.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 10.9-13.5%). PAD prevalence increased with age. PAD prevalence was 7.0% (95% CI = 5.6-8.4%) for those aged 60 to 69, 12.5% (95% CI = 10.4-14.6%), and 23.2% (95% CI = 19.8-26.7%) for those aged 70 to 79 and 80 and older. Age-adjusted estimates show that non-Hispanic black men and women and Mexican-American women had a higher prevalence of PAD than non-Hispanic white men and women (19.2%, 95% CI = 13.7-24.6% 19.3%, 95% CI = 13.3-25.2%PAD prevalence increases with age and is associated with treatable risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
