Value of electrocardiographic and ankle-brachial index abnormalities for prediction of coronary atherosclerosis in asymptomatic subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with increased cardiovascular risk, in part due to accelerated subclinical atherosclerosis. Electrocardiographic (ECG) and ankle-brachial index (ABI) abnormalities are used to screen for cardiovascular risk in the clinic. However, their capacity to identify patients with type 2 DM with nonobstructive subclinical atherosclerosis is unknown. Associations of ECG and ABI abnormalities with coronary artery calcium (CAC), a measure of coronary atherosclerosis, were examined using multivariable ordinal regression modeling in 589 asymptomatic patients with type 2 DM. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were determined. CAC was prevalent (44% CAC>00 32% CAC>5th percentile score) despite normal electrocardiograms (64%) and ABIs (97%) in most subjects. Neither ECG nor ABI changes predicted CAC after adjusting for age, gender, and race. ECG abnormalities were neither sensitive nor specific for detection of CAC>100, >400, or>75th percentile (sensitivities 0.43, 0.45, and 0.34
