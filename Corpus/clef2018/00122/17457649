Long-term locoregional vascular morbidity after isolated limb perfusion and external-beam radiotherapy for soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity. Isolated limb perfusion (ILP) with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and melphalan, followed by delayed surgical resection and adjuvant external-beam radiotherapy is a limb salvage treatment strategy for locally advanced soft tissue sarcomas. The long-term vascular side effects of this combined procedure were evaluated.Thirty-two patients were treated for a locally advanced sarcoma of the upper (n = 5) or lower limb (n = 27). All patients underwent a noninvasive vascular work-up.Five patients underwent a leg amputation, in two cases due to critical leg ischemia 10 years after ILP. With a median follow-up of 88 (range, 17-159) months, none of the patients with a salvaged lower leg (n = 22) experienced peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) measurements in the involved leg (median, 1.02 range, .50-1.20) showed a significant decrease compared with the contralateral leg (median, 1.09ILP followed by resection and external-beam radiotherapy can lead to major late vascular morbidity that requires amputation. Objective measurements show a time-related decrease of ABI and femoral PI in the treated extremity.
