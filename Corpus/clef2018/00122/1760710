Effect of weight on claudication distance. Conservative measures to improve claudication distance include advice on smoking, exercise, diet and weight reduction. Although the effects of smoking, exercise and diet are established, the effect of weight is less clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of carrying extra weight on the maximum walking distance in stable claudicants. Twenty stable claudicants were exercised on a treadmill (3.5 km/h, 0 degrees slope) carrying 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10 kg weights in randomized sequence. Maximum claudication distance and ankle: brachial pressure indices were recorded. Patients were categorized into mild or severe claudicants depending on their ability to walk 200 m. A response index (RI) was calculated as the reduction in claudication distance per kilogram load RI = [CD0-CD10]/10 m/kg, where CD0 and CD10 represent claudication distance with 0 and 10 kg weights, respectively. Claudication distance was significantly reduced in subjects carrying 5 kg or more (P less than 0.01). A linear relationship was demonstrated between the mean claudication distance and the load carried (r = 0.98, P less than 0.01) with a mean response index of 10.2 m/kg. The mean(s.e.m.) RI in mild claudicants (25.9(9.5) m/kg) was greater than the value observed in the severe claudicants (3.3(0.8) m/kg
