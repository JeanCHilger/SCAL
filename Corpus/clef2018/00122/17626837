Local vasoconstriction in spinal cord-injured and able-bodied individuals. Local vasoconstriction plays an important role in maintaining blood pressure in spinal cord-injured individuals (SCI). We aimed to unravel the mechanisms of local vasoconstriction [venoarteriolar reflex (VAR) and myogenic response] using both limb dependency and cuff inflation in SCI and compare these with control subjects. Limb blood flow was measured in 11 male SCI (age: 24-55 yr old) and 9 male controls (age: 23-56 yr old) using venous occlusion plethysmography in forearm and calf during three levels of 1) limb dependency, and 2) cuff inflation. During limb dependency, vasoconstriction relies on both the VAR and the myogenic response. During cuff inflation, the decrease in blood flow is caused by the VAR and by a decrease in arteriovenous pressure difference, whereas the myogenic response does not play a role. At the highest level of leg dependency, the percent increase in calf vascular resistance (mean arterial pressure/calf blood flow) was more pronounced in SCI than in controls (SCI 186 +/- 53% controls 51 +/- 17%
