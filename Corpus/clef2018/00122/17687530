Importance of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Ten questions and answers. Leg artery stenoses often indicate generalized atherosclerosis of the arterial circulation. They can easily and reliably be diagnosed by the family physician or the nurse with Doppler ultrasound measurements and the calculation of the ankle-brachial index (ABI). A decreased value (< 0.9) is not only a sign of peripheral arterial disease, but is also associated with a doubled risk of future coronary or cerebrovascular events. Patients with a low ABI, even if yet asymptomatic, should receive intensive preventive measures in the same manner and intensity as patients with coronary heart disease.
