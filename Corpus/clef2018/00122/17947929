Non-randomized, prospective, multi-centre evaluation of the ABSOLUTE .035 peripheral self-expanding stent system for occluded or stenotic superficial femoral or proximal popliteal arteries (ASSESS Trial): acute and 30-day results. The aim of the paper was to investigate the performance of the ABSOLUTE .035 Peripheral Self-Expanding Stent System in preventing restenosis of superficial femoral or proximal popliteal arteries. Due to a lack of large controlled trials proving its long-term durability femoropopliteal artery stenting is still a matter of debate. In this paper we report the study design, the acute and short-term results of a prospective European registry on the treatment of TASC B and C femoropopliteal lesions with the use of the ABSOLUTE stent.This prospective, non-randomized, multi-centre study enrolled 122 patients with symptomatic peripheral occlusive disease at 14 sites in Europe. Patients were included with obstructed femoropopliteal arteries. Key inclusion criteria were de novo lesions > or = 4.0 mm and < or = 7.0 mm in diameter, and > or = 40 mm and < or = 200 mm in length. Single target vessel treatment had to be performed with a maximum of three stents.Mean target lesion length was 108 +/- 44 mm (range 22.2 to 200 mm) and mean reference vessel diameter 4.6 +/- 0.8 mm by quantitative angiography 71% of the lesions analyzable by quantitative angiography (QA) had total occlusions. A total of 227 stents were implanted, 224 of which were deployed successfully (98.7%). Mean percentage of diameter stenosis was reduced from 90.9 +/- 15.5 % (range 41.3 to 100) to 19.0 +/- 8.4% (range 2.3 to 41.5). Device and procedural success were 83.6% each whereas technical success reached 100%. Sixteen lesions had a > or = 30% residual stenosis post-procedure, 6 of them (37.5%) rated as being calcified. Eleven patients experienced major complications (9.1%) and 6 patients experienced minor complications (5%) within 30 days. Duplex ultrasound based 1-month restenosis rate was 9.3%. Target lesion revascularization (TLR) and target vessel revascularization (TVR) rates were 0.8% and 1.7%, respectively and amputation rate was 0.8%. Mean ankle-brachial index (ABI) at rest and after exercise increased significantly from baseline to 30 days follow-up by 0.63 +/- 0.20 to 0.94 +/- 0.17 and from 0.44 +/- 0.23 to 0.85 +/- 0.21, respectively (P<0.001 each).The treatment of TASC B and C femoro-popliteal lesions with use of the ABSOLUTE stent is safe and feasible. Short-term follow-up documents persistent improvement of hemodynamics. The 6- and 12-month data have to be awaited for further conclusions:
