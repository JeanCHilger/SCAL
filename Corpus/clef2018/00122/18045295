Hemodynamic features of congenital aortic valve stenosis with patent ductus arteriosus in children. The aim of the present paper was to investigate the hemodynamic features of congenital aortic valvar stenosis (AS) associated with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), and to develop information to guide management of AS with coexistent PDA.Hemodynamic measurements were performed in eight of 11 patients with AS before and following transcatheter closure of a PDA. Doppler cardiac ultrasound and chest X-rays were performed during follow up.In each of the 11 patients, aortic valve gradient was markedly reduced following transcatheter ductal closure. In only one of them was balloon aortic valvuloplasty necessary.Aortic valve gradient was markedly overestimated before closure of PDA. The significance of this finding has focused on selecting appropriate management so that a PDA is not overlooked when intervention for AS is performed.
