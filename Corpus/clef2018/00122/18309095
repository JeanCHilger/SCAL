Ultrasound assessment of popliteal vein compliance during a short deflation protocol. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether ultrasound is a useful tool to measure the venous characteristics of the lower extremity during a standard venous collecting cuff deflation protocol. To accomplish this, lower extremity pressure-cross-sectional area (CSA) and pressure-volume relationships were measured in eight (25 +/- 1 yr) supine subjects. Popliteal vein CSA was assessed by using high-resolution ultrasound, while calf volume changes were simultaneously assessed by using venous occlusion plethysmography (VOP). Pressure-CSA and pressure-volume relationships were assessed at baseline, during the cold pressor (CP) test, and following sublingual nitroglycerin (NTG) administration. Relationships were modeled with a quadratic regression equation, and beta(1) and beta(2) were used as indexes of venous compliance. Popliteal vein regression parameters beta(1) (8.485 +/- 2.616 vs. 7.638 +/- 2.664, baseline vs. CP 8.485 +/- 2.616 vs. 7.734 +/- 3.076, baseline vs. NTG
