Impaired flow-mediated endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vasodilation of the brachial artery in patients with atherosclerotic peripheral vascular disease. A flow-mediated endothelium-dependent vasodilation and endothelium-independent nitroglycerin-induced vasodilation were carried out in 70 patients and 15 age-matched adults without any atherosclerotic risk factors to clarify vascular responsiveness in patients with atherosclerotic peripheral vascular disease. The percent change in flow-mediated vasodilation was significantly lower in patients than in controls (5.4 +/- 0.7% vs 12.8 +/- 2.2%, P < .001). Moreover, the percent change in nitroglycerin-induced vasodilation measured after sublingual administration of nitroglycerin was lower in patients than in controls (5.8 +/- 0.6% vs 10.2 +/- 1.5%, P < .01). On multiple regression analysis, none of the determinant factors showed a significant correlation with flow-mediated vasodilation. In contrast, Fontaine classification was found to be a significant predictor for nitroglycerin-induced vasodilation (r = -0.307, P < .05). There is a significant positive correlation between nitroglycerin-induced vasodilation and ankle-brachial pressure index in the patients. The data showed that vasoditation function were markedly impaired in end-stage patients with peripheral vascular disease.
