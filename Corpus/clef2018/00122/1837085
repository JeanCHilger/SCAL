Deep phlebitis of the lower limbs. Diagnostic value of D-dimer assays. D-dimers are specific fibrin degradation products which have been measured in plasma and used as a diagnostic test for deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs. However, the results published so far have often been conflicting. We compared the results of D-dimer assays by the latex method (positivity threshold: 0.5 microgram/ml) in 3 groups of patients: 22 patients with clinically suspected thrombophlebitis confirmed by doppler ultrasound 22 patients with clinically suspected thrombophlebitis not confirmed by doppler ultrasound
