Relationships between vascular indexes and atherosclerotic risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The relationships of cardio-ankle vascular index, (a new indicator of arterial stiffness), common carotid artery intima-media thickness, and ankle-brachial pressure index with atherosclerotic risk factors were compared in patients with type 2 diabetes. There were significant correlations between each pair of the above vascular indexes. Both cardio-ankle vascular index and intima-media thickness showed significant correlations with age, systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, and serum total cholesterol. Ankle-brachial pressure index showed a significant negative correlation with pulse pressure but not with systolic blood pressure and total cholesterol. Logistic regression analysis showed that cardio-ankle vascular index and intima-media thickness were associated with systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure independently of age. These results suggest that there are significant associations among the 3 vascular indexes and that systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure are major, age-independent determinants of cardio-ankle vascular index and common carotid artery intima-media thickness in patients with diabetes.
