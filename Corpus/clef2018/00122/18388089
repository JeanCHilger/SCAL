The effect of hypercholestrolemia on calf muscle hemoglobin oxygen saturation in patients with intermittent claudication. The purpose was to compare calf muscle hemoglobin oxygen saturation and exercise performance in hypercholesterolemic and normocholesterolemic patients with peripheral arterial disease. Hypercholesterolemic and normocholesterolemic patients had similar ankle/ brachial index (0.72 +/- 0.24 vs 0.79 +/- 0.28, [mean +/- SD] P = .334). Hypercholesterolemic patients had shorter initial claudication distance (214 +/- 168 m vs 331 +/- 185 m, P = .026), absolute claudication distance (391 +/- 219 m vs 549 +/- 211 m, P = .035), and lower calf muscle hemoglobin oxygen saturation at the occurrence of initial claudication distance (27 +/- 21% vs 39 +/- 20%
