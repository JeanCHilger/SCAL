Critical limb ischemia. Critical limb ischemia can be divided into acute and chronic forms. All patients suspected of the acute form should be evaluated immediately, as urgent revascularization is usually necessary. Chronic critical limb ischemia is the most complicated type of peripheral artery disease (PAD). Typical for it are pain at rest and necrosis or gangrene. The most important known risk factors are nicotine, hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipoproteinemia. Patients suffering from PAD run a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events and therefore should be on permanent antithrombotic therapy as secondary prophylaxis. Besides clinical examination and determination of the ankle/brachial index, complementary imaging is mandatory. Here angiography is the gold standard. For therapy surgical and other interventional procedures are available. The decision on individual therapy follows an interdisciplinary approach based on an international consensus (TASC classification).
