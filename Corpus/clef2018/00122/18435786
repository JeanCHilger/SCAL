Long-term outcome of transplant renal artery stenosis managed conservatively or by radiological intervention. The natural history and optimal treatment of transplant renal artery stenosis (TRAS) is poorly defined. Few studies reported long-term clinical outcomes. A single centre analysis of 43 patients diagnosed with TRAS 1990-2003 was performed. Twenty-seven had percutaneous intervention (including 10 patients who had >1 intervention) and 16 were managed conservatively at the discretion of the attending clinicians. Transplant function was assessed by slope of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) over five yr of follow-up. Patients in the intervention group had lower mean eGFR (36.3 mL/min/1.73 m(2) vs. 46.3 mL/min/1.73 m(2) p = 0.07) at baseline. Five transplants in the intervention group failed (including two as a direct result of intervention) and one in the conservative group failed. There was no significant difference in the rate of deterioration in renal function (mean slope of eGFR minus 0.8 mL/min/yr and minus 1.0 mL/min/yr in the intervention and conservative groups, respectively
