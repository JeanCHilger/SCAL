Recoverability of erectile function in post-radical cystectomy patients: subjective and objective evaluations. Literature regarding both subjective and objective evaluations of erectile function following radical cystectomy is deficient.To study the recoverability of erectile function in post-radical cystectomy patients on subjective and objective bases.Between March 2003 and March 2005, 45 male patients with organ-confined invasive bladder cancer were prospectively enrolled in this study.Radical cystectomy and urinary diversion were offered to all patients (21 patients underwent a nerve-sparing [NS] surgical technique, and 24 patients underwent a non-nerve-sparing [NNS] surgical technique).Patients were evaluated preoperatively using the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire and using penile Doppler ultrasound (PDU). Patients were followed up regularly at 2 mo, 6 mo, and 12 mo using the same parameters.Among patients in the NS group, 17 patients (78.8%) were potent postoperatively: 12 patients (57.8%) with spontaneous complete tumescence and 5 patients (21%) with partial tumescence using phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (PDE5-I) as erectogenic aid 4 patients needed intracorporeal prostaglandin E1 injections. In contrast, no patients in the NNS group showed spontaneous erection, and they did not improve with sildenafilThe return of erectile function was better in the NS group on subjective and objective bases. The most significant change was in veno-occlusive function, which improved rapidly and progressively in the NS group during 1 yr of follow-up.
