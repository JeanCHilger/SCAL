Coronary angioplasty in drug eluting stent era for the treatment of unprotected left main stenosis compared to coronary artery bypass grafting. Improved outcomes of percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) with drug-eluting stents (DES) have resulted in their expanded use for left main coronary artery (LMCA) stenosis.We compared outcomes of patients undergoing PCI for unprotected LMCA stenosis and patients treated by coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).Between January 2005 and January 2007, 6705 patients were studied with coronary angiography in northern Finland. All subjects treated with revascularization of LMCA stenosis (n = 287) were included and followed up for a mean of 12+6 months.From 287 patients, 238 underwent CABG, and 49 had PCI with DES. The incidence of 1-year mortality was 4% among the PCI-treated and 11% among CABG-treated patients (P = 0.136). After the first month, mortality among PCI-or CABG-treated patients did not differ statistically significantly (2% versus 7%, P = 0.133). The most significant independent predictor of mortality was reduced left ventricular systolic function (hazard ratio 14.9, 95% CI 5.5-40.0, P < 0.001).PCI with DES for selected LMCA disease patients results in short- and midterm outcomes comparable to results of CABG in general. PCI is a viable therapeutic option in selected patients with LMCA stenosis.
