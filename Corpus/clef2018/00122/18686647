Prediction of worse outcome by systemic atherosclerosis following acute ischemic stroke. To determine the relationship between atherosclerosis and the short-term outcome following an acute ischemic stroke.Quantitative measurements of ankle brachial index (ABI), color-coded carotid duplex (CCD), electrocardiography (ECG), and other cardiovascular risk factors were performed for acute ischemic stroke patients. Prevalent cardiovascular disease (PCVD) was defined when there were evident abnormal findings of ABI, CCD, or ECG.Among the 68 patients, there were 19 with PCVD, 12 with abnormal ABI, 8 with abnormal CCD, and 4 with abnormal ECG. Patients with PCVD had worse Barthel index (BI) at discharge and BI difference between admission and discharge if compared to those with non-PCVD (P < 0.05).Ankle brachial index, CCD and ECG may serve as convenient quantitative parameters of atherosclerosis. Patients with evident systemic atherosclerosis may have greater vascular burden, resulting in worse short-term functional outcome after acute ischemic stroke.
