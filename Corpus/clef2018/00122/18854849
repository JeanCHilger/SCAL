Relationship between serum bilirubin and albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes. Previous studies showed that low serum bilirubin concentrations are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. To explore this further, we evaluated the relationships between serum bilirubin concentrations and the degree of urinary albumin excretion and other markers of subclinical atherosclerosis in 633 consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes. Multiple regression analysis showed that the serum bilirubin concentration was an independent determinant of and had a significant inverse correlation to the log urinary albumin excretion. Serum bilirubin concentrations were significantly lower in patients with than in those without cardiovascular disease. A significant inverse correlation was found between the serum bilirubin concentration and pulse wave velocity, while a significant positive correlation was found to the ankle-brachial index in a subgroup of 386 patients. Our study shows that the serum bilirubin level is associated with microalbuminuria and subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with type 2 diabetes.
