Relationship between noninvasively measured endothelial function and peripheral arterial disease. To determine the relationship between endothelial function by means of brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (BAFMD) and the clinical severity of peripheral arterial disease (PAD).We examined the brachial artery diameter by ultrasound, before and after ischemia of the arm in 3 groups of participants- group A: healthy individuals under 30 years, without cardiovascular risk factors (n = 30) group B: patients with PAD and ischemic claudication (n = 30)Patients with PAD present endothelial dysfunction, but this does not seem to determine the severity of the disease.
