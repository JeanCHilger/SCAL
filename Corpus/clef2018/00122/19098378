Postural changes may influence popliteal atherosclerosis by modifying local circumferential wall tension. Atherosclerosis of peripheral arteries typically affects vessels of the lower limbs, suggesting that local hemodynamic stimuli play a role in this process. Our study evaluated the effects of body postural changes on carotid and popliteal blood pressure, circumferential wall tension (CWT) and arterial strain, and investigated the relationship between such hemodynamic parameters and intima-media thickness (IMT) of these arteries. One hundred seventeen nondiabetic, nonhypertensive, nonsmoker subjects (48 men and 69 women) were enrolled and had their blood pressure measured in the arm and calf in supine and orthostatic positions. Echo-doppler analysis evaluated the common carotid and popliteal arteries after blood pressure measurements, while CWT was calculated according to Laplace's law. The results showed that changing from supine to orthostatic posture increased blood pressure and CWT in popliteal but not in carotid arteries. Partial correlation analysis adjusted for age and body mass index revealed no major relationship between IMT of the studied vessels and local blood pressure or arterial strain. Conversely, supine and orthostatic CWT exhibited comparable correlation coefficients with carotid IMT, while orthostatic CWT displayed a stronger relationship with popliteal IMT than with supine CWT. These results were confirmed by multiple linear regression analysis that included age, sex, body mass index, lipid fractions and glucose as independent variables. Overall, our results indicate that orthostatic CWT is a stronger hemodynamic predictor of popliteal IMT than supine CWT, suggesting that erectile posture may be a potential risk factor for popliteal atherosclerosis because it increases the local hemodynamic burden.
