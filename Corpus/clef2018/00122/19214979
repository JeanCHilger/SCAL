Results after balloon angioplasty or stenting of atherosclerotic subclavian artery obstruction. Endovascular therapy is an accepted treatment strategy in occlusive disease of the subclavian artery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the technical and clinical long-term outcome following either balloon angioplasty (plain balloon angioplasty (PTA)) or stenting.The authors retrospectively analyzed 108 interventions of atherosclerotic lesions of subclavian arteries or the brachiocephalic trunk (107 patients mean age of 66 +/- 9 yearsThe primary success rate was 97% (100% for stenoses (78/78) and 87% for total occlusions (26/30)). Treatment modalities included PTA alone (13% n = 14) or stenting (87%Endovascular therapy of atherosclerotic subclavian artery obstructions result in excellent acute success rates even in total occlusions. Results evince good durability of endovascular therapy for atherosclerotic occlusive disease of subclavian arteries and with a trend towards better outcome with stenting compared to PTA.
