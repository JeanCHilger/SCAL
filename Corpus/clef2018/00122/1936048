Myocardial accumulation and clearance of technetium 99m teboroxime at 100%, 75%, 50% and zero coronary blood flow in dogs. Sequential changes in the regional distribution of technetium 99m Teboroxime (SQ30217) were evaluated in nine dogs with graded coronary artery stenosis, occlusion and reperfusion of either the left anterior descending or left circumflex arteries. 99mTc-Teboroxime accumulation recorded by planar imaging was compared with directly measured coronary blood flow (Doppler) and regional myocardial perfusion (microspheres). Serial images were recorded beginning at the time of injection and continuing for the next 18 min. The data were summed from minutes 2-3, 3-6, 4-8 and 9-18 after injection for comparison with the other parameters. Myocardial clearance of Teboroxime was analysed at each level of blood flow. There was a linear relationship between the Teboroxime activity ratio (abnormal/normal) and coronary blood flow (r = 0.96) and regional myocardial perfusion (r = 0.99). Zones of diminished perfusion were least apparent in the summed images recorded during minutes 2-3. In later images, the lesions were well visualized. The myocardial clearance half-times at 100%, 75% and 50% flow were not significantly different, while clearance half-time at total occlusion was significantly (P less than 0.01) faster. In the 3-6, 4-8 and 9-18 minutes summed images, the Teboroxime activity ratio increased significantly (P less than 0.01) after reperfusion compared with total occlusion.
