Evaluation of carotid atherosclerosis from the perspective of blood flow reflection. Detection and prevention of atherosclerosis at an early stage is important for its prevention. The aim of this study was to propose a valid and highly reliable index for the evaluation of carotid atherosclerosis or carotid function. Images of carotid Doppler wave profiles were processed using an image processing software, and the relative fluctuation in blood flow was calculated from the luminance in one cardiac cycle. Frequency analysis was performed and up to 10 time components of basic frequency (f1) were indicated. The evaluation function alpha was estimated by calculating the ratio of the sum of components f3-f10 against the f1 + f2 components. Blood pressure of the finger was continuously measured using Finapress during passive postural change from the supine to the standing position, the baroreceptor function was evaluated by the frequency method, and the plaque score was measured by ultrasound tomography. The influence of factors such as arterial compliance, blood vessel resistance, and heart rate on this index was studied using electric circuit model simulation. The subjects were 33 patients (18 men, 15 women) who had various types of atherosclerotic disease and hypertension. The average age was 67.3 + 12.2 years. The results showed that index alpha had a strong negative correlation with age and plaque score, and a weak positive correlation with baroreceptor function. Simulation results supported the clinical result. We proposed a new index to evaluate carotid atherosclerosis without blood pressure measurement using the carotid Doppler method. It is a potential index for detecting atherosclerosis of local arteries such as the carotid.
