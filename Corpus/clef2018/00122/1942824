Reserve possibilities of creating the routes of collateral circulation in stenosing lesions of major arteries of the head. The analysis of complex examination of 54 patients with stenosing lesion of the major cephalic arteries by means of Doppler ultrasound, ultrasound scanning, carotid angiography, computerized tomography is presented. The most frequently, two ways of collateral blood flow--via the anterior communicative artery and via the branches of the external carotid artery were revealed. In the first case, ischemia of cerebral tissue is not pronounced, because the anterior communicative artery is functioning in change of a pressure gradient. The second way of collateral blood flow is less reliable, because it is developing slowly and do not provide adequate supply and normal functioning of the nerve cells.
