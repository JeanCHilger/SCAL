Leg showering therapy in patients with intermittent claudication. Ten patients with intermittent claudication were treated using a recently constructed "chair" in which the seated patient has alternately warm and cool water flushed over the legs and feet. A trial treatment was given for 25 minutes, three times a week for 5 weeks. Ankle/arm index, skin perfusion pressure and calf blood flow all remained unchanged immediately after such a series of treatment. Even at follow-up 6 months later, values were unchanged but for a minute increase in ankle/arm index in the poorer leg. Walking capacity was additionally measured and an improvement was seen, also after 6 months. The role of the contrast temperature treatment in this improvement is, however, unclear.
