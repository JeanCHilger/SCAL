Treatment strategies for peripheral artery disease. Peripheral arterial disease is an underecognized manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis associated with high rates of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The rationale of therapy is to reduce cardiovascular risk, improve symptoms of intermittent claudication, and prevent the development of critical limb ischemia and amputation. Exercise therapy and several pharmacologic agents have been shown to improve walking distance in patients with intermittent claudication. Patients with lifestyle-interfering symptoms despite exercise, or those who progress to critical limb ischemia, frequently undergo revascularization. Endovascular techniques are commonly used in these patients. Combined pharmacological and endovascular strategies will play an increasing role in management of these patients in the future.
