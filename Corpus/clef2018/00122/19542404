Doppler ultrasound findings in the hepatic artery shortly after liver transplantation. The purpose of this article is to describe the Doppler waveform findings in the hepatic artery in the early posttransplantation period, both in the absence and presence of arterial complications.The presence of transient high-resistance Doppler waveforms in normal hepatic arteries is a common finding after grafting. Hepatic artery thrombosis and stenosis, and arterial steal syndromes can be diagnosed by Doppler in the early liver transplantation period.
