The use of Doppler ultrasound to assist with sciatic nerve blocks. Twenty consecutive patients requiring surgical procedures on a lower extremity received leg blocks using a modification of Labat's classic approach. A Doppler ultrasound pencil probe was used to identify the dominant arterial structure exiting the sciatic notch with the sciatic nerve. A block needle was inserted in the same orientation as the probe until paraesthesias were elicited then 25 ml of local anesthetic was injected. Successful block was achieved in one or two attempts in 70% of the patients.
