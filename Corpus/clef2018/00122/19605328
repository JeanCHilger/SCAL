Determinants of peripheral arterial stiffness in patients with chronic kidney disease in southern Taiwan. High prevalences of peripheral artery occlusive disease (PAOD) and increased arterial stiffness have been reported in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, these have not been assessed in Taiwan where the prevalence of CKD is high. The aim of this study was to investigate the determinants of PAOD and arterial stiffness in patients with CKD in southern Taiwan. We enrolled 169 patients with stage 3-5 CKD in one regional hospital. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity were measured using an ABI-form device (Colin VP1000). In multivariate analysis, ABI<0.9 was positively correlated with the presence of diabetes mellitus (p=0.014) and negatively correlated with the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (p=0.049), and increased brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity was correlated with increased age, diabetes mellitus, increased systolic blood pressure, decreased pulse pressure and decreased eGFR. This study identified determinants of PAOD and arterial stiffness in patients with CKD in one hospital in southern Taiwan. In addition to the traditional atherosclerotic risk factors, decreased eGFR was also correlated with PAOD and increased arterial stiffness in these patients.
