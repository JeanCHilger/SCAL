Post void dribbling: incidence and risk factors. The primary aim of this study was to determine the incidence of post void dribbling (PVD) in women being evaluated for pelvic floor dysfunction. The secondary aim was to identify other conditions present in women with symptoms of PVD.163 consecutive women with complaints of PVD who underwent urodynamic testing were studied. Testing was performed to evaluate women scheduled for surgery for incontinence, irritative bladder, urinary retention and pelvic organ prolapse. Subjects completed a medical history and voiding diary. A complete pelvic exam was performed. Patients were questioned regarding symptoms of PVD, stress incontinence, urge incontinence and insensible urine loss. Menopausal status, hormone replacement therapy status, age, body mass index, residual urine volume, genital hiatus length, and evidence of pelvic organ prolapse were recorded. Maximal urethral closure pressure, urethral length, pressure transmission ratio, and documentation of detrusor overactivity or urodynamic stress incontinence were determined by urodynamic testing.42% of patients had symptoms of PVD. The incidence of PVD decreased with age. In pre- and peri-menopausal women, there was an association between PVD and urge incontinence. In post-menopausal women, there was an association between age, body mass index, and genital hiatus length.There was a significant correlation between PVD and urge incontinence in pre-menopausal patients. The overall incidence and causes of PVD relative to age require further study. Body mass index and genital hiatus length may play an important role in PVD, especially in post-menopausal women.
