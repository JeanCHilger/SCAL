Diagnosis and treatment of pediatric patients with late-onset portal vein stenosis after living donor liver transplantation. Portal vein stenosis (PVS) after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is a serious complication that can lead to graft failure. Few studies of the diagnosis and treatment of late-onset (> or = 3 months after liver transplantation) PVS have been reported. One hundred thirty-three pediatric (median age 7.6 years, range 1.3-26.8 years) LDLT recipients were studied. The patients were followed by Doppler ultrasound (every 3 months) and multidetector helical computed tomography (once a year). Twelve patients were diagnosed with late-onset PVS 0.5-6.9 years after LDLT. All cases were successfully treated with balloon dilatation. Five cases required multiple treatments. Early diagnosis of late-onset PVS and interventional radiology therapy treatment may prevent graft loss.
