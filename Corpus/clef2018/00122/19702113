Correlation between acute coronary syndrome, hyperlipoproteinemia and statins. Atherosclerosis is defined as a chronic, progressive, proliferative and inflammatory process developed as a response of blood vessel endothelium to the numerous noxious factors. The definition, which is only an approximate one, shows that one of the terms to carry definition is progression. In other words, it is a well-known fact today that atherosclerosis is a progressive process. The question about the possibilities of its stagnation and regression arises. The appearance of statins and their introduction into the therapy and the process of prevention give a positive answer to the previous question. The results of many studies have also shown that statins can be used to decrease and even stop the process of atherosclerosis. Using the modern diagnostic procedures, primarily the intravascular and Doppler ultrasound, andfocusing on regression, these studies fillowed the process of atherosclerosis in patients with statin therapy. The conclusions of these studies have indicated a clear degree of regression of atherosclerosis which is not a spectacular one, but implies the significant clinical improvement.
