Partial hindlimb occlusion reduced the susceptibility to sustained ventricular tachycardia in conscious rats. Remote conditioning induced by ischemia in distant organs protects the heart from ischemia/reperfusion injury however, its effect on ischemia-induced ventricular arrhythmias is unknown. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that partial hindlimb occlusion during coronary artery occlusion increases the ventricular arrhythmia threshold (VAT) induced by coronary artery occlusion. Rats (n = 7) were instrumented with a radio-telemetry device for recording arterial pressure, electrocardiogram (ECG), and body temperature. A Doppler ultrasonic flow probe and vascular occluder were placed around the terminal aorta. Finally, a snare was placed around the left main coronary artery. The VAT was determined without and, on an alternate day, during partial hindlimb occlusion (remote conditioning) in conscious rats. Without remote conditioning, the VAT was 4.56 + 0.15 minutes. Importantly, remote conditioning significantly increased the VAT (6.29 + 0.49 minutes), suggesting that ischemia in a distant organ may delay the development of ischemia-induced ventricular arrhythmias.
