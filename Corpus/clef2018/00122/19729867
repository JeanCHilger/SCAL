Possible association of atrophic gastritis and arterial stiffness in healthy middle-aged Japanese. Helicobacter pylori (HP) has been implicated as a risk factor for cardiovascular and atherosclerotic diseases. Arterial stiffness determined by pulse wave velocity (PWV) or the cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) has been shown to be higher in HP-positive subjects than in HP-negative subjects however, this result has been observed only in young subjects. The aim of the study was to investigate the possible correlation between HP infection and PWV or CAVI in middle-aged subjects.We measured brachial-ankle PWV (baPWV), CAVI, metabolism markers, pepsinogens (PGs) and IgG antibody to HP in 343 individuals aged either 60 or 65 year old. Atrophic gastritis (AG) was diagnosed based on the values of PGs.baPWV and CAVI were significantly higher in the AG-positive group than in the AG-negative group even after adjusting for possible confounding factors (baPWVc 16.63+/-3.50 vs. 15.59+/-3.47 p=0.010, CAVIcThere may be an association between atrophic gastritis and atherosclerosis in middle-aged subjects.
