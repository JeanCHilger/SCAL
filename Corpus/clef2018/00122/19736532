Risk factors for development of peripheral and carotid artery disease among type 2 diabetic patients. (Full text is available at http://www.manu.edu.mk/prilozi). The study was aimed to define the risk factors for development of peripheral arterial (PAD) and carotid artery disease (CARD) among type 2 diabetic patients (T2D). The study population consisted of 30 patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and absent vascular disease. the mean age of the study population was 53.3 +/- 7.3 years. 60% of patients were women and 40% of them men. Patients were followed up for three years for development of peripheral and carotid artery disease. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) was defined by ankle-brachial index < 0.9 or > 1.3. Carotid arterial disease was defined if carotid plaque or stenosis (> 50%) presented. We built a multivariable logistic regression analysis to define the factors of development of vascular disease and a multiple linear regression analysis to identify the factors associated independently with numerous values of carotid IMT and ABI. Development of PAD and CARD were registered in 43.8% of patients. Progression of carotid IMT was found in 62.5 % of pts. Progression of PAD was predicted by HDL - cholesterol and urea, systolic blood pressure and diabetes duration. Progression of carotid IMT was determinate with: BMI, weight, diastolic blood pressure and age. Our study defined risk factors that independently influence the development of PAD and CARD in pts with T2D. This data has clinical usefulness in the improvement of prevention and in optimizing the treatment of type 2 diabetic patients. Key words: peripheral arterial disease, ankle-brachial index, carotid plaque, carotid stenosis, IMT, type 2 diabetes.
