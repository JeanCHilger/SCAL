Femoropopliteal bypass vs percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting in treatment of peripheral artery diseases of infrainquinal segment - short-term results. (Full text is available at http://www.manu.edu.mk/prilozi). Critical limb ischaemia is a result of occlusive arterial disease in the infrainquinal segment and is a major indication for arterial revascularization, which implies a femoropopliteal bypass procedure or an interventional procedure - stent graf notting of the occluded segment. Although indications for both techniques are clearly defined, there are still controversies. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine short-term results in patients treated with these two treatment modalities. In the period between 2002 and 2008 a total of 70 patients with occlusive arte notrial diseases of the low extremity were analysed. In 50 out of 70 patients a femo notro notpopliteal bypass was made. Of these, in 30 (60%) patients PTFE material was used and in 20 (40%) patients an autologous saphenous vein graft was used. The other group comprised 20 patients who underwent stenting. In patients treated with surgical revas notcularization, the major indication for surgery was occlusive arterial disease in: stage II - in 10 patients (20%), stage III - in 5 patients (10%), stage IV - in 25 patients (50%) and the remaining 10 patients (20%) had subacute ischaemia. Arteriography showed three crural patent tributaries in 18% of the patients, two patent crural tributaries in 40% of the patients and one crural patent tributary in 32% of the patients. There were no significant differences concerning indications and arteriographic findings between the two subgroups. The follow-up period lasted for 6 months and the patency rate was 85% (17) for venous bypass, 11 (64.6%) - short-segment lesions (< 4 cm) and 6 (35.3%) lon notger segment lesions (> 4 cm) versus 76.5% (23) for PTFE graft (p < 0.05), of which 13 (56.5%) were short-segment (<4 cm) and 10 (43.5%) longer segment lesions (> 4 cm). The following results were obtained for the second group of patients: initially successful stents in 85% failure in 15% or 2 patients
