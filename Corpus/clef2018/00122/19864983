Peripheral arterial disease: current perspectives and new trends in management. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is defined as an arterial brachial index (ABI) of < or =0.90 in the lower extremities and results from a narrowing of the arteries as a result of progressive atherosclerosis. PAD affects 12-20% of Americans aged 65 years or older however, most are asymptomatic and many do not seek treatment. Improved awareness and education in both the general population and among health care providers about these modifiable risk factors has the potential to improve general health and decrease morbidity and mortality secondary to atherosclerotic vascular disease.
