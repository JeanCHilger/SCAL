Impact of peripheral arterial disease on health status: a comparison with chronic heart failure. To further document the experienced burden in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD), we compared the health status of patients with PAD and chronic heart failure (CHF). As a secondary aim, we studied clinical and socio-demographic correlates of health status in both conditions.We conducted a cross-sectional observational study in four outpatient clinics in the Southern part of The Netherlands, with subjects consisting of ambulatory (346 PAD and 188 CHF) patients. All patients completed the Short-Form 12 to assess their physical and mental health status. Information about socio-demographic, clinical risk factors, and disease severity indices was obtained from patients' medical records. Propensity methodology was applied to enhance comparability between both medical conditions.Type of medical condition explained differences in health status (F = 33.1, P < .0001, Effect Size = 0.27). Impaired physical health status was more often reported in PAD patients (48.4%) compared with CHF patients (17.4%, Odds Ratio [OR] = 4.4, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 2.3-8.8, P < .0001) impaired mental health status was more noted in CHF patients (43.5% vs. 22.0%, OR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.2-2.6, P = .002). In PAD, younger age (P = .002), low education (P = .02), cardiac history (P = .02), diabetes mellitus (P = .03), and a lower ankle brachial index (P = .003) were associated with worse physical health statusBy contrasting PAD patients' health status with another chronic disabling condition, the impact of PAD on patients' physical health status became evident whereas mental health status was more affected in CHF, patients with PAD reported a greater physical burden as compared with CHF patients. PAD patients who were younger, lower-educated, without a partner or had a cardiac history especially reported a higher disease burden. Clinicians need to be aware of these differences in order to develop tailor-made disease management programs for different groups of cardiovascular patients.
