Plasma adiponectin concentration is associated with ambulatory daytime systolic blood pressure but not with the dipping status. The objective of this study was to analyse the relationship between the ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) measurement and plasma adiponectin levels in a population-based cohort. Non-hypertensive, non-diabetics from the Oulu Project Elucidating Risk of Atherosclerosis cohort aged 40-60 years with ABP measurement available in 226 men and 236 women were analysed. ABP was recorded using the fully automatic SpaceLabs 90207 oscillometric unit. Plasma adiponectin concentrations were assayed using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Without adjustment the highest plasma adiponectin tertile was associated with the lowest ABP and office BP measurements (P from 0.025 to P<0.001, respectively). Only the association of plasma adiponectin concentration with systolic ABP was independent of other conventional risk factors (age, body mass index (BMI), waist, gender, insulin sensitivity index, smoking and alcohol consumption) for hypertension (P=0.017). No association was observed between systolic dipping pattern and adiponectin level. The plasma high adiponectin concentration is independently associated with low daytime systolic ABP value. The mechanisms may include effects on endothelial function and the sympathetic nervous system.
