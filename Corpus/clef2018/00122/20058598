The role of early hepatic artery ischemia on biliary complications after liver transplantation and hepatic arterial interventional therapy. To explore the influence of early hepatic artery ischemia on the occurrence and prognosis of biliary complications after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), and the value of early hepatic arterial interventional therapy.In the 720 recipients who received OLT in our hospital from October 2003 to June 2007, 32 cases were detected hepatic artery stenosis (HAS, 30 cases) or hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT, 2 cases) by color Doppler Ultrasound from 4 to 65 days (mean, 25 +/- 15) after OLT. All of them were confirmed by DSA and/or CT angiography. Of the 32 patients, 20 were treated by hepatic arterial interventional therapy. The end-point of follow-up was the time of patient's death and retransplantation.In this study, 20 cases developed biliary complications, including the common bile duct stenosis in 2 cases, intra- and extra hepatic bile duct stenosis in 13 cases and multiple intrahepatic bile duct stenosis in 5 cases. Among them, 2 patients complicated with bile leakage, 4 with biloma and 3 with liver abscess. Of the 20 patients, 8 with HAS received successful hepatic arterial interventional therapy which was performed two weeks after HAS detected 10 with HAS didn't receive hepatic arterial interventional therapyEarly hepatic artery ischemia after OLT is an important agent for biliary complications. Early and successful hepatic arterial interventional therapy helped to reduce the incidence of biliary complications and improve the patients' prognosis.
