Effect of oral immunization with pooled antigens derived from adipose tissue on atherosclerosis and obesity indices. Modulation of the inflammatory response through vaccination has shown promise in animal models of atherogenesis and obesity-main risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Tableted preparation, V-6, containing pooled antigens derived from pig adipose tissue was administered per os daily to 13 volunteers for 3 months. Total cholesterol and LDL levels have not changed from the baseline value 193.4 vs 191.8 (p=0.75) and 113.8 vs 117.2 (p=0.18), respectively. Triglyceride levels declined by 26.1% from 163 to 120.5mg/dL (p=0.29). HDL increased by 25.9% from 38.6 to 48.5mg/dL (p=0.000002) in 12 out 13 patients. Despite negligible effect of V6 on weight and body mass index, i.e., 67.87 vs 66.58 kg (-1.9%
