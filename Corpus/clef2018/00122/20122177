Safety and efficacy trial of adipose-tissue derived oral preparation V-6 Immunitor (V-6): results of open-label, two-month, follow-up study. Chronic inflammations, atherosclerosis and obesity, are major risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Immune modulation of the inflammatory response has shown promise in animal models of atherogenesis and metabolic disease. Tableted dietary supplement, V-6, containing pooled antigens derived from pig adipose tissue has been administered daily to 12 volunteers for 2 months.No significant changes were observed in liver ALT and AST enzymes, i.e., 28 vs 23.8 IU and 22.6 vs 24.8 IU, with p=0.07 and p=0.49, respectively. Creatinine decreased 0.88 vs 0.84 mg/dL (p=0.05) while BUN moved upwardThese results demonstrate that V-6 is safe and has a potential as an anti-atherogenic and overweight/obesity immune intervention.
