Evaluation of feasibility of ankle pressure and foot oximetry values for the detection of critical limb ischemia in diabetic patients. A total of 261 diabetic patients were admitted because of rest pain and/or foot ulcer in 1 limb. Ankle pressure (AP) and transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPO(2)) were measured, and digital subtraction arteriography was performed. Transcutaneous oxygen tension was <30 mm Hg in 213 patients and >or=30<50 mm Hg in 48 patients. Ankle pressure could not be measured in 109 patients. In 50 patients, AP was <70 mm Hg and in 102 patients, it was >or=70 mm Hg. Arteriography showed evidence of stenoses >50% of vessel lumen diameter in all patients. Major amputation was performed in 16 patients AP was <70 mm Hg in 4 patients and >or=70 mm Hg in 6. It was not practicable in the remaining 6 patients. Transcutaneous oxygen tension was <30 mm Hg in 15 patients and >or=30 mm Hg in 1 patient. For diagnosis of critical limb ischemia (CLI) in diabetic patients presenting with rest pain or foot ulcer, measurement of TcPO( 2) is essential not only when AP is not measurable but also when this value is >or=70 mm Hg.
