Sniff nasal inspiratory pressure versus IC/TLC ratio as predictors of mortality in COPD. Hyperinflation is a recognized adverse prognostic factor in COPD. As the sniff inspiratory nasal pressure (SnIP) principally reflects the severity of hyperinflation in COPD, we hypothesized that it might also be a predictor of mortality. We therefore compared the SnIP to the inspiratory capacity-to-total lung capacity (IC/TLC) ratio as predictors of mortality in advanced COPD.A retrospective mortality analysis of 110 patients with COPD (mean FEV(1) 1.01litres, 37% predicted 66% male) was performed. All patients had SnIP and lung volume measurements performed. The power of each test to predict mortality was determined, and predicted survival curves were created for both the SnIP and IC/TLC ratio.37 patients (34%) died during the study period (29 male, 8 female). Mortality rates were analysed with a Chi(2) test there was a significant trend towards male death (mortality rate male vs. femaleThe SnIP conveys at least as much predictive power for mortality in COPD as hyperinflation determined by IC/TLC ratio. This test is cheaper, quicker and easier than measuring lung volumes by plethysmography.
