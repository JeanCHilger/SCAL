Hypogastric artery stenosis in a patient with severe chronic ischemia. Atherosclerotic lesions of the hypogastric artery have been recognized as a cause of buttock claudication, thigh claudication, and impotence, and usually treated by endovascular procedures and in some instances with open surgery. We report an unusual case of a total occlusion of the left external iliac artery, severe stenosis of the left hypogastric artery with rest pain, and ischemic lesion in the left foot that was successfully treated with hypogastric angioplasty and covered self-expanding stent implant. The patient recovered distal pulses, rest pain disappeared, and the ischemic lesion healed currently the patient walks without intermittent claudication, and the lesion of the toe has healed.
