Reduced high-density lipoprotein level is linked to worse ankle brachial index and peak oxygen uptake in postmenopausal women with peripheral arterial disease. Women with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) have more limited physical function than men but the mechanisms involved are not clear. We determined whether alterations in lipid components, such as decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), are associated with worsening intermittent claudication (IC) in postmenopausal women with PAD. Our cross-sectional cohort study included 69 postmenopausal women with IC (Fontaine stage II). A treadmill test was used to measure initial claudication distance (ICD), absolute claudication distance (ACD), peak oxygen uptake, and ankle systolic blood pressure. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol correlated with ankle brachial index ([ABI] R = .29, P = .019). No other lipid profile components were associated with exercise performance and hemodynamic measures. Among women with HDL-C <50 mg/dL (n = 43), the median peak oxygen uptake level was significantly lower (P = .021) relative to women with normal HDL-C >50 mg/dL (n = 26). Lower HDL-C levels are associated with worse ABI and decreased peak oxygen uptake in postmenopausal women with PAD.
