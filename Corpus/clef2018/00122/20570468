Histologic atherosclerotic plaque characteristics are associated with restenosis rates after endarterectomy of the common and superficial femoral arteries. This study assessed the predictive value of histologic plaque characteristics for the occurrence of restenosis after femoral artery endarterectomy.It would be advantageous if patients at increased risk for restenosis after arterial endarterectomy could be identified by histologic characteristics of the dissected plaque. Differences in atherosclerotic plaque composition of the carotid artery have been associated with restenosis rates after surgical endarterectomy. However, whether atherosclerotic plaque characteristics are also predictive for restenosis in other vascular territories is unknown.Atherosclerotic plaques of 217 patients who underwent a common femoral artery endarterectomy (CFAE n = 124) or remote superficial femoral artery endarterectomy (RSFAEThe 1-year restenosis rate was 66% (61 of 93) after RSFAE compared to 21% (26 of 124) after CFAE. Plaque with characteristics of high collagen and smooth muscle cell content were positively associated with the occurrence of restenosis, with odds ratios (ORs) of 2.90 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.82-4.68) and 2.20 (1.50-3.20) for superficial femoral artery (SFA) and common femoral artery (CFA), respectively. SFA plaques showed significantly heavier staining for collagen (69% vs 31% for CFA P < .001) and smooth muscle cells (64% vs 36% for CFAPlaque composition of the CFA and SFA differs. Furthermore, the dissection of a fibrous collagen-rich plaque is an independent predictive variable for restenosis after endarterectomy of the CFA and SFA.
