Recanalization with laser and angioplasty of atherosclerotic lesions of the legs. Personal experience with 31 treated lesions. From January to November 1989, 31 iliac and femoro-popliteal atherosclerotic lesions were treated in 29 patients (age range: 33-80 years) by means of percutaneous laser-assisted angioplasty. The lesions were 6 iliac tubular stenoses, 6 iliac occlusions and 19 femoro-popliteal occlusions, 2-20 cm long. The laser equipment employed was in 10 cases a Cardiolase 4000 Nd:YAG "hot tip" unit, and in 21 cases a Nd:YAG "sapphire contact probe" unit. Initial success was achieved in 23/31 lesions (74%) the follow-up, by clinical examination, Doppler US, and ankle-arm pressure index performed every 4th month, showed 1-year actuarial patency of 80% for femoro-popliteal occlusion and 100% for iliac lesion, with 87% cumulative patency. Overall complication rate was 22.5%. There were 6 local complications, 4 of which were hematomas at the arterial puncture site, and 2 were performation of the superficial femoral artery, all without any clinical sequelae
