Doppler colour flow imaging in peripheral arterial disease. Duplex scanning is unique in its ability to provide both anatomical and physiological information about the circulation, but it is time-consuming and difficult to perform. Technological advances now allow the Doppler information to be colour-coded, making scanning both quicker and more accurate. This article describes the technique and potential use of Doppler colour flow imaging in the investigation and treatment of peripheral arterial disease.
