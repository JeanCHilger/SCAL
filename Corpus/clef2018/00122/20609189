Impact of serum apolipoprotein A-IV as a marker of cardiovascular disease in maintenance hemodialysis patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between serum apolipoprotein (apo) A-IV levels and markers for atherosclerosis, including carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and the ankle-brachial index (ABI), in hemodialysis patients. We performed a cross-sectional study involving 116 maintenance hemodialysis patients (70 males median age, 64 years), measuring CIMT, ABI, the usual laboratory examinations, and serum apo A-IV before the dialysis session. The apo A-IV concentration was measured by a noncompetitive ELISA. Serum apo A-IV concentrations were significantly lower in hemodialysis patients with cardiovascular disease and plaque in the carotid artery. The apo A-IV level was positively associated with urea nitrogen and creatinine, and negatively associated with age, interleukin-6, the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, and maximum CIMT. Moreover, serum apo A-IV concentrations were significantly lower in the low ABI group. On logistic analysis, patients with high apo A-IV levels had a lower odds ratio for atherosclerosis (maximum CIMT > 1.0) and cardiovascular disease compared to patients with low apo A-IV levels. On stepwise multivariate regression analysis, the serum apo A-IV level was independently associated with creatinine, the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, and the maximum CIMT. Serum apo A-IV is associated with atherosclerotic lesions in hemodialysis patients. Apo A-IV levels may be useful for estimating the risk of cardiovascular disease in dialysis patients.
