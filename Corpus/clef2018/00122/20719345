High serum concentrations of pentosidine, an advanced glycation end product, are associated with low normal value of ankle-brachial index in apparently healthy men. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) is widely used for peripheral arterial disease screening and is associated with future cardiovascular events. Pentosidine, an advanced glycation end product, accumulates with age and in diabetes and end-stage renal disease but the significance of elevated serum pentosidine is not well known. We investigated the relationship of the ABI to circulating pentosidine concentrations as well as other atherogenic factors in apparently healthy men. The study group consisted of a total of 170 apparently healthy men (age, 55 ± 9 years). Serum pentosidine concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The mean ABI and pentosidine concentrations of the whole study group were 1.16 ± 0.07 (range, 0.98-1.35) and 36.1 ± 10.6 ng/mL (range, 11.2-81.0), respectively. Univariate analysis showed that the ABI was inversely correlated with pentosidine (P = .0004), small low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (P = .017), LDL cholesterol (P = .019), apolipoprotein B (P = .024), fasting insulin (P = .028), very small LDL cholesterol (P = .036), difference in ABIs between legs (P = .037), malondialdehyde-modified LDL (P = .044), and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (P = .047). Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis revealed that increased pentosidine, fasting insulin, small LDL cholesterol, difference in ABIs between legs, difference in systolic blood pressure between arms, and reduced body mass index were independent determinants of reduced ABI (adjusted R(2) = 0.237, P < .0001). Serum pentosidine was an important, independent determinant of ABI in healthy men. Subjects with an ABI less than 1.10 showed higher pentosidine concentrations.
