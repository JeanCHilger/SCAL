Dynamics of the recovery of disturbed functions in patients with stroke after carotid endarterectomy. The recovery of disturbed functions was followed up for 1 year after ischemic stroke in 85 patients with atherosclerotic stenosis of internal carotid arteries. Fifty patients underwent carotid endarterectomy and 35 patients refused surgery. Somatic signs, neurological status measured with the NIH-NINDS, functional state (Barthel index), quality of life and neuropsychological status were assessed. The Doppler ultrasound of precerebral arteries and neurovisualization were performed. The significant positive changes, including the reduction of focal neurological deficit, the improvement of cognitive functions and quality of life, the normalization of functional state, were noted after the carotid endarterectomy. In patients who refused surgery, these parameters did not change significantly compared to baseline. The number of the recorded ischemic events in the operated patients was much lower as well.
