Carotid artery disease assessed by color Doppler flow imaging: correlation with standard Doppler sonography and angiography. Carotid artery disease was assessed in 180 patients by means of color Doppler flow imaging. Color Doppler findings in 360 carotid arteries were compared with the results of standard Doppler sonography, and color Doppler findings in 60 bifurcations were compared with the results of intraarterial angiography. The sensitivity of color Doppler for the detection of carotid disease was 100% when compared with angiography. The accuracy of color Doppler in classifying minor (40-60%), moderate (61-80%), and severe (81-90%) stenosis ranged from 91.3% to 97.8% vs standard Doppler sonography, and from 91.7% to 95.8% vs angiography. Whereas all occlusions were identified correctly by both color Doppler and angiography, four pseudoocclusions of the carotid artery were misdiagnosed as occluded. Characteristic features providing reliable criteria of the degree of stenosis are (1) intensity, extent, and duration of color fading (2) postprocessed systolic peak frequency
