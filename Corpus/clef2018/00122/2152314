Budd-Chiari syndrome, pulmonary thromboembolism, and deep venous thrombosis associated with "lupus anticoagulant" and recent use of oral contraceptives. The Budd-Chiari syndrome is the clinical manifestation of the total or partial obstruction of the hepatic veins and/or inferior vena cava. It is an infrequent cause of portal hypertension. The chronic presentation is the most frequent and is characterized by right upper quadrant pain, hepatomegaly, and ascites of slow onset. We report a case of a 26 year old woman affected by this disorder associated to a recent use of oral contraceptive and a "Lupus Anticoagulant". She subsequently developed deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. She died almost 6 years after the onset of symptoms.A 26-year-old woman sought medical care in April 1983 because she had been experiencing pain in the right upper quadrant for 2 months, as well as an enlarged abdomen and postprandial fullness accompanied by nausea and vomiting.  She had used oral contraceptives (OCs) for a period of 11 months up to 4 months before the inception of the symptoms.  Examination showed normal vital functions but painful hepatomegaly.  Hepatic biopsy showed dilatation of the central vein of the lobe ultrasound of the liver showed hepatomegaly, the dilatation of hepatic veins, and suprahepatic veins
