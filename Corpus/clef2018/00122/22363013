Percutaneous intervention in peripheral artery disease improves calf muscle phosphocreatine recovery kinetics: a pilot study. We hypothesized that percutaneous intervention in the affected lower extremity artery would improve calf muscle perfusion and cellular metabolism in patients with claudication and peripheral artery disease (PAD) as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS). Ten patients with symptomatic PAD (mean ± SD: age 57 ± 9 years ankle-brachial index (ABI) 0.62 ± 0.17
