Prognostic usefulness of clinical and subclinical peripheral arterial disease in men with stable coronary heart disease. The prognostic value of symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) is well documented, but few reports differentiating between symptomatic and asymptomatic forms of PAD are available. We investigated the respective prognostic effect of clinical and subclinical PAD on long-term all-cause mortality in patients with stable CHD. We analyzed 710 patients with stable CHD referred for hospitalization for CHD evaluation and management. As a part of the study, they completed questionnaires on medical history, underwent a standardized clinical examination, including ankle-brachial index (ABI) measurement, and provided a fasting blood sample. Three groups of patients were individualized: no PAD (no history of PAD and ABI >0.9 but ≤1.4) subclinical PAD (no history of PAD but abnormal ABI [i.e., ≤0.9 or >1.4)
