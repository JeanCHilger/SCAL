Accuracy of the ankle-brachial index using the SCVL(®), an arm and ankle automated device with synchronized cuffs, in a population with increased cardiovascular risk. To evaluate the accuracy of the ankle brachial index (ABI) measured with the SCVL(®) ("screening cardiovascular lab" GenNov, Paris, France), an automated device with synchronized arm and ankle cuffs with an automatic ABI calculation.Patients were consecutively included in a cardiovascular prevention unit if they presented with at least two cardiovascular risk factors. ABI measurements were made using the SCVL, following a synchronized assessment of brachial and ankle systolic pressure. These values were compared to the ABI obtained with the usual Doppler-assisted method.We included 157 patients. Mean age was 59.1 years, 56.8% had hypertension, 22.3% had diabetes mellitus, and 17.6% were current smokers. An abnormal ABI was observed in 17.2% with the SCVL and in 16.2% with the Doppler. The prevalence rates of an abnormal ABI by patient measured with each device, ie, 15.7% (confidence interval [CI] 0.95: [11.8 20.4]) or 14.3% (CI 0.95: [10.7The SCVL is a fast and easy to use automated oscillometric device for the determination of ABI. The use of this two-synchronized-cuff device correlates well with the gold standard Doppler ultrasound method and is reproducible. The SCVL may ease the screening for peripheral arterial disease in routine medical practice.
