A new endovascular radiofrequency device for dilatation of vascular stenosis in a rabbit model. To investigate the use of a new endovascular radiofrequency (RF) device, the Habib™ VesCoag™ Catheter, to induce vascular remodeling and dilatation of arterial stenosis in a rabbit model.RF was used to induce arterial stenosis in 10 rabbits and this was confirmed by angiography and color Doppler ultrasound. Two groups of five animals were then subjected to (1) balloon dilatation of the stenosis (intervention group), (2) no intervention (control group). Two rabbits from each group were sacrificed following the procedures to investigate vessel histopathology. At six weeks, the remaining six rabbits underwent follow-up angiogram and color Doppler ultrasound to assess vessel patency. They were then sacrificed and the vessels prepared for histopathological analysis. Three-dimensional images with confocal microscopy of the arterial lumen were also acquired.In the intervention group, stenosis was reversed and patency confirmed by angiography and color Doppler ultrasound six weeks later in all surviving rabbits. Histopathology revealed degenerative changes of elastic fibers, focal losses of elastica lamella, disorganization of myocytes and extensive hyalinization of the tunica adventitia. Focal elastin changes of the arterial elastic lamella were also shown by three-dimensional confocal microscopy images.We have developed a novel endovascular RF catheter that can be safely and effectively used to induce vascular remodeling and dilatation of arterial stenosis in an experimental rabbit model.
