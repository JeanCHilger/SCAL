Impact of combined assessment of coronary artery calcium score, carotid artery plaque score, and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity for early coronary revascularization in patients with suspected coronary artery disease. Coronary artery calcium score (CACS) measured by multi-detector computed tomography, carotid plaque score (CPS) measured by carotid artery ultrasound, and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) are noninvasive screening tools for coronary artery disease. The aim of this study was to determine whether the combination of CACS, CPS, and baPWV improves the prognostic value for future cardiac events. CACS, CPS, and baPWV were assessed in 77 patients (mean age, 65 years, 49 males) undergoing invasive coronary angiography. ECG-triggered MSCT was used to assess CACS. CPS was defined as the sum of all plaque heights in bilateral carotid arteries. The highest baPWV was used for analysis. Cardiac events were defined as cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or coronary revascularization. Thirty-two cardiac events (41.6%) occurred during follow-up (23.6 ± 20.8 months), consisting of 28 PCIs and 4 CABGs. The best cutoff values of positive CACS, CPS, and baPWV for predicting cardiac events were ≥ 50, ≥ 5, and ≥1.6 m/second, respectively. For the combination of the 3 modalities, the positive test was defined as having at least 1 positive result by each method. The negative predictive value of all 3 modalities combined was better than that of CACS alone. The event-free rate was higher in patients with negative results for all 3 parameters compared with those that were positive (100% versus 44.8%, P < 0.0001). The prognostic value of using combined assessment of CACS, CPS, and baPWV is more effective for predicting cardiac events than CACS alone.
