A multicenter study design to assess the clinical usefulness of semi-automatic measurement of flow-mediated vasodilatation of the brachial artery. Flow-mediated vasodilatation of the brachial artery (FMD) is a marker which is related to endothelial nitric oxide bioavailability. Commercially available ultrasound machines equipped with online computer-assisted semi-automatic analysis software to measure FMD have recently become available in Japan. These devices enable more convenient examination, enhanced reproducibility of FMD measurement, and a shortened examination time. Using such devices, in the present multicenter prospective study we propose to: 1) establish standardized FMD values and determine the annual rates of FMD change in healthy subjects 2) confirm the predictive value of FMD for future cardiovascular events in Japanese subjects
