Elevated serum creatinine in a kidney transplant recipient: unusual suspect. We report a rare form of transplant renal artery stenosis discovered 3 months after transplantation. Our patient had mechanical renal artery "kinking", which responded to balloon angioplasty. Doppler ultrasound, followed by an arteriogram confirmed the diagnosis. This case demonstrates that transplant renal artery "kinking" stenosis,though rare, can cause graft dysfunction and worsening hypertension in kidney transplant recipients.
