Epidural epinephrine and the systemic circulation during peripheral vascular surgery. This study was designed to determine the haemodynamic effects of epidural epinephrine, 5 micrograms.ml-1, added to bupivacaine, 0.75 per cent, in elderly patients with cardiac disease undergoing peripheral vascular surgery (PVS). The effect of epidural epinephrine on the plasma concentration of bupivacaine was also measured. Twenty patients with a history and/or ECG evidence of myocardial ischaemia requiring PVS were randomly assigned to two groups. The patients were monitored with a modified V5 ECG, oscillometric BP monitor and a PA catheter. After control haemodynamic measurements, 12 ml of bupivacaine, 0.75 per cent, +/- epinephrine, 5 micrograms.ml-1, was injected over five minutes into the epidural space at L3-4. Supine haemodynamic measurements were repeated at 15 and 45 min after injection. At 15 min after epidural injection, compared with control values, patients receiving epidural epinephrine showed a significantly greater decrease in mean blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance, and a significantly greater increase in cardiac output than patients receiving plain epidural bupivacaine (79.3 +/- 11.6 per cent vs 94.6 +/- 16.8 per cent, 61.6 +/- 9.0 vs 91.6 +/- 19.2 per cent, 130.8 +/- 23 vs 105 +/- 20.8 per cent, respectively). These differences were not present at 45 min after epidural injection. Heart rate was not significantly different between groups at either time. The presence of epidural epinephrine reduced the peak plasma concentration of bupivacaine from 0.86 +/- 0.20 to 0.64 +/- 0.33 micrograms.ml-1 and increased the time to achieve this concentration from 16.1 +/- 11.2 to 33.7 +/- 20.1 min.
