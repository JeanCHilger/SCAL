Non-invasive diagnosis of carotid artery disease. Non-invasive carotid evaluation has been developed in an effort to delineate safely the pathological anatomy and hemodynamic effects of carotid atherosclerotic disease. Non-invasive tests can be divided into direct tests which examine the hemodynamics. Following tests are considered as indirect tests: ophthalmodynamometry, doppler examination, oculoplethysmography and as direct tests: phonoangiography, Doppler ultrasound en Duplex scanning. A combination of a direct and indirect test will augment the sensitivity and specificity of the evaluation of carotid artery disease.
