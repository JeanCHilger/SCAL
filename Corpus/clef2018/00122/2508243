Use of prostacyclin in the treatment of patients with chronic occlusion of the peripheral arteries (stage IV). Preliminary results of the use of prostacyclin in 6 patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (IV stage) are presented. Diagnosis was supported by clinical signs, Doppler ultrasound and arteriography. There were 4 diabetics, one with Mb BÃ¼rger and the other with obliterant atherosclerosis. All patients were unsuccessful by treated with antiaggregants, vasodilators and haemorheological medicaments. The reconstructive vascular surgery was also impossible. However amputation was necessary. The patients treated by intra-venous and intra-arterial prostacyclin administration in the dose of 5 ng/kg b.w./min during different periods of time (24, 48, 72 h). During intrahospital treatment complete relief of pain and gangrene demarcation in all patients. One month later two patients manifested necrotic progression and amputation of a limb was necessary. The long-term clinical success was registered in 4 patients (1-16) months). Indications, doses, side effects of prostacyclin action are discussed.
