Percutaneous recanalization of occluded upper leg arteries using laser treatment. Percutaneous transluminal laser recanalization was attempted in 21 patients with occluded superficial femoral arteries and 'life style limiting claudication'. Primary success was achieved in 20 (95%) of these total occlusions. In 7/21 no laser energy was required. At one month only 1 patient had claudication and the mean Doppler ankle/arm systolic pressure ratio had increased by 0.36 +/- 0.19 (p less than 0.001) at rest and 0.47 +/- 0.34 (p less than 0.001) after exercise. Complications directly attributable to the procedure were: perforation (1), peripheral embolic episodes (2), haematoma (1), transient vasospasm (2). All complications could be treated non-surgically. These preliminary data suggest that laser recanalization of relatively short occlusions of the superficial femoral artery, followed by balloon dilatation, may be accomplished with satisfactory acute and short-term results, but not without risk.
