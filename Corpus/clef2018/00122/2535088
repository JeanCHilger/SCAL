A device for noninvasive assessment of perfusion pressure in the skin of healthy volunteers. A device allowing pressure to be applied to a local skin site where the skin blood flow is followed using laser Doppler flowmetry is described. The blood flow was studied on the back of the hand in eight volunteers before and during brachial arterial occlusion and while the external pressure was increased step by step. The flowmetry value during arterial occlusion was 0.3 +/- 0.1 AU, and when the external pressure was increased to 120 mm Hg the values were similar (p = .44). The skin perfusion pressure, defined as the least external pressure needed to achieve flow cessation, was found to be 92 +/- 16 mm Hg (range 70-111 mm Hg), and the mean arterial pressure was 90 +/- 9 mm Hg (NS). The skin perfusion value is in agreement with that found by others using other techniques for measuring blood flow and a circumferent cuff for applying pressure.
