Determination of the steno-occlusive degree using non-invasive methods in diabetic patients with peripheral arterial insufficiency. 58 diabetic patients with peripheric arteriopathy are studied by means of segmentary pressure and oscillometry. Best results for proximal levels were those obtained with segmentary pressure index, whereas oscillometry was better for distal level (ankle and foot). The application of these criteria would facilitate the detection of arterial occlusions without need arteriography.
