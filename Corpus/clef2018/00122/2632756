Circulatory changes in muscle and skin arteries in orthostatic hypotension and constitutional hypotension. It is not known whether there are vascular changes in the peripheral circulation of patients with orthostatic hypotension and patients with constitutional hypotension. Therefore, blood flow was studied simultaneously at the calf (mainly muscle circulation) and at the finger (mainly finger circulation) with ECG-triggered venous occlusion plethysmography. Calf and finger blood flow were measured for 20 min at rest and during reactive hyperaemia due to an arterial occlusion for 3 min. Vascular resistance was calculated from the blood flow and arterial blood pressure. In orthostatic hypotension there is a decreased vasodilator capacity of the calf resistance vessels and not of the finger resistance vessels. In constitutional hypotension there is a decreased vasodilator capacity of the calf and finger resistance vessels. These results suggest that there are structural or functional changes, or both, in the muscle and skin circulation of patients with constitutional hypotension, whereas there are only structural or functional changes, or both, in the muscle circulation of patients with orthostatic hypotension.
