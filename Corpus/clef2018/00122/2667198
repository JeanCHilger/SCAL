Doppler ophthalmic blood pressure measurement in the hemodynamic evaluation of occlusive carotid artery disease. In 102 patients with angiographically proven occlusive carotid artery disease of 60-100% diameter reduction, Doppler ophthalmic artery pressure and blood flow direction were recorded by the recently developed ophthalmomanometry-Doppler technique. Among these 102 patients, 50 presented with complete carotid artery occlusions and 52 with carotid artery diameter stenoses of greater than or equal to 60%. Mean +/- SD Doppler ophthalmic artery pressure was 69 +/- 15 mm Hg ipsilateral to the occlusion and 86 +/- 18 mm Hg ipsilateral to a stenosis of the carotid artery (p less than 0.001). The mean +/- SD Doppler ophthalmic pressure index (ratio of the ophthalmic artery to systemic blood pressure) was lower ipsilateral to the occlusion (0.46 +/- 0.08) than ipsilateral to a carotid artery stenosis (0.54 +/- 0.08 p less than 0.001)
