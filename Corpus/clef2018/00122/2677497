Dynamics of oxygen tension in the tissues of patients with post-thrombophlebitic syndrome. With the use of the methods of percutaneous contact polarography, roentgeno-contrast phlebography, Doppler ultrasound, 83 patients with different location and stage of the post-thrombophlebitic syndrome were examined. The significant alteration of the indices of polarographic curve versus the norm was defined. The most pronounced disorders were revealed in occlusion of the deep veins of the lower extremities.
