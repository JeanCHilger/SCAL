A new low molecular weight heparin in the treatment of peripheral arterial disease. A double blind study was conducted on patients afflicted with obstructive arteriopathy of the lower limbs in order to verify the efficacy and tolerability, in long term treatment, of a new low molecular weight heparin (Alfa LMW1). Of the 55 patients studied, 28 were treated with Alfa LMW1 given subcutaneously in doses of 8,000 I.U. AXa daily for 6 months the remainder 27 were treated with Placebo.
