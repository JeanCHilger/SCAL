The haemodynamic effects of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. The aim of the study was to measure the haemodynamic effect of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). Twenty-one consecutive patients with unilateral stenosis of the iliac (n = 13) or femoropopliteal arteries (n = 8) causing intermittent claudication were studied with ankle and brachial systolic pressure measurements before and after PTA and at six monthly intervals. In 15 patients, the pressures were measured not only at rest, but after exercise on a standard treadmill. There were six technical failures. All of the remaining patients were improved clinically and objectively. The resting pressure index increased from mean (+/- ISD) of 0.65 +/- 0.22 to 0.88 +/- 0.17 and the postexercise index from 0.43 +/- 0.21 to 0.82 +/- 0.22. The preoperative claudication distance was improved from 83 m +/- 31 to 252 m +/- 104 and the recovery time from 6.3 mins +/- 5.7 to 1.5 mins +/- 2.3. During the follow up period of six weeks to 2 1/2 years, the initial improvement was maintained and there were no failures clinically or on further Doppler examination. The results suggest that for patient with a single significant stenosis, PTA is an effective alternative method of treating claudication.
