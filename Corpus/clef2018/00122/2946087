Improvement after successful percutaneous transluminal dilation treatment of occlusive peripheral arterial disease. Six hundred and eighty-one transluminal dilations were performed at the Toronto General Hospital between 1978 and 1984. In this consecutive series, 207 iliac and 65 femoropopliteal successful dilations were performed for claudication in patients with good runoff. Using this ideal group of patients in whom one would expect the greatest improvement, we determined the extent of improvement after successful transluminal dilation. Persistent mild symptoms were frequent and the ankle to brachial blood pressure ratio often remained abnormal. We have concluded that transluminal dilation can be used as an adjunct or alternative to surgical treatment if certain clinical, roentgenographic and technical criteria are met.
