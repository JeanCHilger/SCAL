Doppler blood flow measurement in atherosclerotic posterior tibial artery. An important element in successful free tissue transfer is an intact recipient artery. This vessel must be anatomically accessible, structurally suitable for anastomosis, and able to transmit an adequate blood volume. In the case presented, there was radiographic evidence of recipient artery disease, with a presumed decrease in flow. However, Doppler blood flow studies predicted near normal flow. This information was useful in making intraoperative decisions regarding the suitable vessel for anastomosis.
