Comparison of clinical judgment, Doppler ultrasound, and fluorescein fluorescence as methods for predicting intestinal viability in the pony. Strangulation obstruction was induced in anesthetized ponies for periods of 2 and 3 hours by clamping 45-cm segments of jejunum and associated veins (venous strangulation obstruction) and arteries and veins (arterial and venous strangulation obstruction). Four segments were studied in each of 7 ponies allowed to survive 12 hours, 2 segments in a pony that was allowed to survive 1 hour, and 1 segment in each of 10 ponies allowed to survive 42 days after the strangulation periods ended. Fifteen minutes after the periods of strangulation obstruction ended, the viability of test segments was assessed by clinical judgment (40 segments), fluorescein fluorescence (40 segments), and Doppler ultrasound (32 segments). Because the test segments were normal at necropsy in long-term survivors, all segments were designated as viable. The overall accuracy of the methods used to predict viability was 88% for Doppler ultrasound and 53% each for clinical judgment and fluorescein fluorescence (P less than 0.005). Failures in the last 2 techniques could be attributed to their tendency to score venous strangulation obstruction segments as nonviable (90% for each). Doppler ultrasound was 94% accurate in these segments.
