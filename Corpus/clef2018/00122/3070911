Non-invasive diagnosis of occlusive lesions of the aorto-femoral segment. A device is proposed for a noninvasive examination of hemodynamics of the aorto-femoral segment which allows to make compression of the arteries under the inguinal ligament. The arterial pressure is measured with an ultrasonic sensor under decompression of the pneumatic balloon. Under examination there were 369 patients. The examination has revealed different stages of stenosis of the iliac segment from the initial symptoms (50% stenosis) up to a pronounced stenosis. The occlusion of iliac arteries was diagnosed and collateral circulation was quantitated.
