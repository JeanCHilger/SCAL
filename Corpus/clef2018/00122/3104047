Effects of intra-arterial prostaglandin E1 in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease. The effects of intraarterially administered prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) on macrocirculatory, microcirculatory and metabolic parameters in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease were studied. Nutritive calf muscle blood flow, as determined with the xenon-clearance technique, and muscle tissue oxygen pressure increased markedly in patients with obliterations of the femoral artery. Transcutaneous PO2 as indicator for cutaneous blood flow increased in prestenotic regions dose-dependently whereas there was a clear poststenotic decrease during the infusion period. High lactate/pyruvate ratios in the femoral vein were significantly decreased by PGE1 treatment. PO2 in the femoral vein increased significantly. Thus, PGE1 has some beneficial effects on muscle circulation in these patients.
