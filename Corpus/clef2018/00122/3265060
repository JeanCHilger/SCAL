Antibodies against monocytes and endothelial cells in the sera of patients with atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease. We looked for antibodies against endothelial cells, monocytes, fibroblasts, lymphocytes and Epstein-Barr virus transformed lymphocytes in the sera of 28 elderly and 18 middle-aged patients with atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease and 13 controls. Inclusion criteria were symptomatic peripheral arterial disease with intermittent claudication and ankle/radial Doppler pressure ratio less than 0.7 in the patient group and greater than 1 in the controls. The sera were tested using a standard cytotoxic technique against a cell panel of monocytes, T and B lymphocytes from 5 donors, and against endothelial cells, fibroblasts and Epstein-Barr virus transformed lymphocytes from one umbilical cord vein and blood. The sera of 30 of 46 (65.2%) patients showed toxicity against monocytes from at least one member of the cell panel and 12 of 19 sera tested (63%) reacted with endothelial cells. Only one of the control sera was positive against monocytes and none reacted with endothelial cells. None of the sera of either patients or controls contained cytotoxic antibodies against T and B lymphocytes, Epstein-Barr virus transformed lymphocytes or fibroblasts. The selective cytotoxicity suggests that the antibodies detected are not against HLA-antigens (which are expressed by normal lymphocytes and Epstein-Barr virus lymphocytes). Our results suggest that immune phenomena occur in atherosclerosis.
