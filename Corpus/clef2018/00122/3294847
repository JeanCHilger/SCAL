Evaluation of axillo-axillary artery bypass for the treatment of subclavian or innominate artery occlusive disease. Because of the higher morbidity and mortality of transthoracic procedures, extrathoracic techniques to revascularize the subclavian or innominate artery, such as carotid subclavian and axillo-axillary artery bypasses have gained wide acceptance. The present work evaluates the results of axillo-axillary bypass in 33 patients who underwent this procedure in the past 13 years. There were 13 males and 20 females with a mean age of 61 years. The occlusive disease was present in the subclavian artery in 19 patients and in the right subclavian artery in 14 patients. Eleven patients presented with central nervous system symptoms and 10 patients complained of ischemic arm symptoms. The remaining 12 patients had both central neurological and upper extremity complaints. Twenty-one of these patients were followed for up to 5 years (mean follow-up 21 months). One patient died during the procedure from myocardial infarction (mortality of 3.03%). Patency of the bypass was determined by palpation of the graft pulse, doppler examination, and brachial arterial pressure determination. The patency rate, after 5 years, calculated by life table analysis, was 72%. In conclusion, axillo-axillary artery bypass can provide durable relief of symptoms with an acceptably high patency rate and low morbidity and mortality. It is the technique of choice in high-risk patients.
