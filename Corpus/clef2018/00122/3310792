Air-fluidized beds or conventional therapy for pressure sores. A randomized trial. To compare the effectiveness and adverse effects of air-fluidized beds and conventional therapy for patients with pressure sores.Randomized trial with both masked and unmasked comparisons of outcome after a median follow-up of 13 days (range, 4 to 77 days).Urban, academic referral, and primary care medical center.Of 140 potentially eligible hospitalized patients with pressure sores, 72 consented to randomization 65 (90%) completed the study.Thirty-one patients on air-fluidized beds (Clinitron Therapy, Support Systems International, Inc., Charleston, South Carolina) repositioned every 4 hours from 0700h to 2300h without use of other antipressure devices. Thirty-four patients on conventional therapy used an alternating air-mattress covered by a foam pad (Lapidus Air Float System, American Pharmaceal Company, Cincinnati, Ohio) on a regular hospital bed were repositioned every 2 hoursPressure sores showed a median decrease in total surface area (-1.2 cm2) on air-fluidized beds, but showed a median increase (+ 0.5 cm2) on conventional therapy 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference between medians, -9.2 to -0.6 cm2 (p = 0.01). Improvement, as assessed from serial color photographs by investigators masked to treatment group, occurred in 71% and 47%, respectivelyOur findings suggest that air-fluidized beds are more effective than conventional therapy, particularly for large pressure sores. Studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of air-fluidized beds in long-term care settings.
