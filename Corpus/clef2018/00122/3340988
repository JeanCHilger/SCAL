Transcutaneous oxygen measurements in lower extremity ischemia: effects of position, oxygen inhalation, and arterial reconstruction. Transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPO2) measurement has been successfully applied to the diagnosis and monitoring of patients with peripheral arterial insufficiency. This study was performed to assess the effects of changes in limb position, oxygen inhalation, and arterial reconstruction on TcPO2 values in patients with peripheral vascular disease. In addition, a TcPO2 index (foot TcPO2/chest TcPO2) was compared with the Doppler-derived ankle-to-brachial index (ABI) to determine which was the more effective monitor of the response to revascularization. Foot TcPO2 values of 22 patients with claudication or rest pain were measured before and after vascular reconstruction. TcPO2 increased after revascularization in both groups regardless of limb position or oxygen (O2) administration. The dependent position and O2 inhalation had an additive effect on TcPO2. Preoperative TcPO2 values in patients with rest pain showed the greatest response to the dependent position, increasing from 14 mm Hg to 33 mm Hg at room air and from 21 mm Hg to 53 mm Hg with O2 inhalation. TcPO2 in both patient groups was remarkably enhanced by O2 administration after revascularization. Postoperative supine TcPO2 values measured at room air increased from 50 mm Hg to 124 mm Hg (148%) in patients with claudication and from 40 mm Hg to 109 mm Hg (173%) in patients with rest pain after O2 inhalation. Comparison of the TcPO2 index with the ABI showed that absolute and normalized TcPO2 values are equally effective in monitoring peripheral arterial insufficiency. This study suggests that placing the limb in the dependent position and administering O2 may augment TcPO2 to levels where symptoms may resolve. The response of TcPO2 to O2 inhalation may be an indicator that reflects the response to revascularization.
