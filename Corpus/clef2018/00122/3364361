Arterial distensibility and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in essential hypertension. Arterial distensibility estimated by carotid femoral pulse wave velocity was evaluated in 22 patients with sustained essential hypertension, together with 3 different methods of blood pressure (BP) measurement: mercury sphygmomanometer, semiautomatic BP recording using the Dinamap apparatus and 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring using a Spacelabs monitor. Although pulse wave velocity did not correlate with BP measured by mercury sphygmomanometer, it strongly and positively correlated with BP measurements using the other 2 procedures. The best correlation was observed with ambulatory BP with respect to systolic BP only (r = 0.685, p less than 0.001). Since cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients is mainly related to lesions of the large arteries, the determination of pulse wave velocity together with ambulatory BP measurements is proposed for the evaluation of cardiovascular risk.
