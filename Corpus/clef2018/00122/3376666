Approach in the treatment of combined aorto-iliac and femoro-popliteal lesions. Recognition of the hemodynamic importance of aorto-iliac and femoro-popliteal stenoses or occlusions is essential for correct vascular reconstruction. Non-invasive examinations, arteriography, pressure- and flow-measurements add their value to clinical judgment and surgical experience. Practical guides are given to decide for one-level-reconstruction, concomitant or delayed two-stage-repair, or a combination of balloon-dilation together with arterial reconstruction.
