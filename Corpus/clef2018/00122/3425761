Vasoconstrictor and vasodilator sites within anteroventral third ventricle region. Previous studies have shown that electrical stimulation of the rat anteroventral third ventricle (AV3V) region produces a characteristic pattern of hemodynamic effects, i.e., renal and mesenteric vasoconstriction, and hindquarters vasodilation. In the present study, we localized the vasoconstrictor and vasodilator effects to specific subregions of the AV3V. In urethan-anesthetized rats prepared with arterial catheters and pulsed Doppler flow probes, we assessed the effects of electrical stimulation of four nuclei within AV3V on mean arterial pressure and renal, mesenteric, and hindquarters resistance. These nuclei were the organum vasculosum lamina terminalis (OVLT), ventral nucleus medianus (median preoptic nucleus), anterior (precommissural) nucleus medianus (median preoptic nucleus), and periventricular preoptic nuclei. Stimulation was carried out by use of a tungsten microelectrode. Stimulation of the OVLT consistently provoked stimulus-locked increases in arterial pressure coupled with increases in mesenteric and renal vascular resistance. Ganglionic blockade with chlorisondamine prevented these responses, demonstrating that they were mediated neurogenically. Stimulation of the three remaining nuclei produced decreases in arterial pressure, hindquarters vasodilation, and little change in mesenteric and renal vascular resistance. No changes in heart rate were observed with stimulation of any of the four nuclei. These results suggest that the vasoconstrictor and pressor functions of the AV3V region are localized in or near the OVLT region, whereas the remaining nuclei of the AV3V region mediate vasodilator and depressor responses.
