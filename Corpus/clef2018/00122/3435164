Cerebral arteriovenous malformation in a neonate: treatment by embolisation. A neonate with an aneurysm of the vein of Galen was treated by embolisation using Giant-urco coils. Doppler ultrasound examination showed that blood flow in the internal carotid artery decreased while that in the pericallosal artery increased after occlusion, suggesting a 'steal phenomenon' with blood directed preferentially towards the aneurysm.
