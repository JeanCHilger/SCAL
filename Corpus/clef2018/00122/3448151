Comparison between ankle and toe index in patients with peripheral arterial disease. In contrast to the systolic blood pressure at the posterior tibial artery, the evaluation of pressure at the digital artery of the foot before and after exercise in patients with peripheral arterial disease is not well known. Twenty three patients with peripheral vascular disease were examined. The systolic pressure was measured by means of an ultrasound velocity detector at the brachial and posterior tibial artery. Digital artery pressure was determined with photoplethysmography. Pressures were measured before and within 5 and 10 minutes after a treadmill test. Ankle and toe index was calculated. At rest the toe index is lower than the ankle index and after a treadmill test the decrease in toe index occurs in parallel to the ankle index.
