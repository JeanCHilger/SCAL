Mechanical properties of excised calf lungs: effects of airway obstruction with beads. Isolated lungs of five calves were suspended in an airtight box used as a ventilator. Lungs were ventilated from the outside at different levels of transpulmonary pressure. Dynamic compliance (Cdyn) and total pulmonary resistance (RL) were measured. These pulmonary function values were also measured during central and peripheral airway obstructions. It was demonstrated that both central and peripheral obstructions induced significant variations of Cdyn and RL. However, decrease of Cdyn was greater and increase of RL was smaller during a peripheral obstruction than during a central one.
