Effect of ketanserin on Raynaud's phenomenon in progressive systemic sclerosis: a double-blind trial. Ketanserin was used in a randomized double-blind trial in 15 patients with Raynaud's phenomenon in progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS). Its effect on Raynaud's phenomenon was evaluated by IR-radiometry, Doppler ultrasound, nailfold capillaroscopy, frequency of finger ulcerations and patient complaints before and after a 3-month course of treatment with oral ketanserin in the dosage of 60 mg daily in the first month and 120 mg in the second and third months. Of the 8 patients treated with ketanserin, 5 showed improvement. In the other 2 patients with progression of skin sclerosis and multiorgan involvement, the peripheral vascular disorder was unchanged. Ketanserin treatment was discontinued in one patient owing to dizziness and anxiety. In one patient ketanserin was reduced to 60 mg daily because of fluid retention. There were no other adverse effects. In 7 control patients on placebo there was no significant improvement in Raynaud's phenomenon. Ketanserin, a selective, specific and pure antagonist of 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) appears to be an effective agent in the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon and digital ischaemic ulcers in PSS. Moreover, ketanserin could contribute to the understanding of the role of 5-hydroxytryptamine in PSS pathogenesis.
