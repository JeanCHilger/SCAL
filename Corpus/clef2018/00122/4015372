In situ femoropopliteal and infrapopliteal bypass. Two-year experience. We describe 83 in situ femoropopliteal and infrapopliteal artery bypass grafts. The in situ technique involved the valve incision method using scissors, the valvulotome (Leather), and a modified valve cutter (Hall). Arteriovenous fistulae were detected intraoperatively by angiography and/or the Doppler method and ligated. The operative indications were rest pain, ulcer, and gangrene in 88% of cases, and claudication in 7.2%. The mean preoperative ankle pressure was 61.3 mm Hg and the ankle-brachial index was 0.43. The mean postoperative ankle pressure was 125.3 mm Hg and the ankle-brachial index was 0.97. The vein utilization rate was 96%. One-year patency for popliteal anastomoses was 85.7%, for peroneal anastomoses it was 100%, and for infrapopliteal anastomoses it was 89.6%. The data suggest that the practicing vascular surgeon can adopt the in situ technique and can expect high graft patency rates even in limb salvage situations with poor distal outflow.
