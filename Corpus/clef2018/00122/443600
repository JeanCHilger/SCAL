Calf blood flow and systolic blood pressure in patients with hyperviscosity of the blood. The calf blood flow and the ankle blood pressure at rest and during post-ischemic reactive hyperemia were measured by an airfilled rubber segment plethysmograph in 5 patients with hyperviscosity of the blood. The patients had no signs of peripheral arterial disease. A normal flow and pressure pattern was obtained. It is concluded that hyperviscosity does not contribute significantly to the peripheral resistance during reactive hyperemia in the patients studied. The importance of hyperviscosity for peripheral resistance in patients with atherosclerosis obliterans is discussed.
