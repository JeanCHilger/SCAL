Ultrasound diagnosis in arteriosclerosis obliterans. From the standpoint of the clinical angiology the ultrasound Doppler method is of great diagnostic evidence. By means of this method depending on physico-technical and apparative prerequisites we succeed in judging the movements of blood in the non-invasive way. Of particular relevance is the sonographic investigation after Doppler of the extracranial part of arteries supplying the brain. In the region of extremities the poststenotic pressure measurings after Doppler give the possibility to establish early clinical stages and to objectify the degree of compensation of arterial circulatory obstructions.
