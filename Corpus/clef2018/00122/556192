The influence of chronic pentroxifylline medication on ergometric and hemodynamic parameters in intermittent claudication (author's transl). In an open clinical trial 14 patients with intermittent claudication caused by an obliteration of the femoral artery received 400 mg pentoxifylline 3 times daily over a period of 6 months. The walking distance, time to peak flow and calf ergometry showed a significant increase. Minor improvement of working hyperemia and peak flow could be found. The systolic pressure gradient over the obstruction didn't change. No patient complained about side effects.
