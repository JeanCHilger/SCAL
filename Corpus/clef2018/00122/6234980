A comparative study of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the iliac and femoropopliteal arteries in arterial disease of the lower extremities. The authors compared the anatomo-radiologic data from a series of 100 consecutive percutaneous transluminal angioplasties (PTA), as well as the immediate and long-term results as a function of the level of the lesion--iliac or femoropopliteal. Proximal to the thigh, there were 57 PTAs, 36 of the common iliac and 21 of the external iliac. In the lower thigh, there were 43 PTAs, 9 of the upper part of the popliteal artery and 34 of the external femoral artery. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the common iliac lesion was dominant in patients under 60 years of age (p less than 0.05). At the iliac level, 89% of the patients had severe claudication at the femoropopliteal level, 39% had trophic problems. The "dominant" or "accessory" character of the lesion did not modify the indication for the procedure, regardless of the level. Segmental thrombosis accounted for 44.2% of the femoropopliteal PTA indications, compared with 7% at the iliac level (p less than 0.04). The failure rate was less at the iliac than at the femoropopliteal level. Follow-up was available for 86.6% of the patients for an average of 22 months. The systolic indices at the thigh after iliac PTA and at the ankle after femoropopliteal PTA were significantly increased (p less than 0.01). At the femoropopliteal level, 74% of the patients were totally asymptomatic. There was one failure (3.8%)
