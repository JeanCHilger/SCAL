Noninvasive diagnosis of renal artery stenosis by echo-Doppler velocimetry. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasonic echo-Doppler velocimetry for the noninvasive diagnosis of renal artery stenosis. Renal artery stenosis was diagnosed if one or more of the following four abnormal hemodynamic parameters were found by Doppler velocimetry: (1) peak blood velocity greater than 100 cm . sec-1 in a focal area along the length of a renal artery, (2) absence of blood velocity during diastole, (3) absence of any detectable blood velocity denoting occlusion, or (4) broad-band Doppler frequency spectra due to focal blood velocity disturbances. With these criteria, the presence or absence of renal artery stenosis was blindly evaluated in 26 patients (52 arteries) who underwent standard or digital subtraction angiography. Compared to arteriography (reduction in diameter greater than or equal to 50%), the sensitivity of Doppler method was 89%, while its specificity was 73%. This noninvasive method may be useful in selecting patients for radiographic evaluation of renal artery stenosis and in the long term follow-up of these patients. Furthermore, echo-Doppler velocimetry may have the unique capability of assessing the hemodynamic consequences of renal artery stenosis.
