A comparison of ultrasound-Doppler sonography and angiography for stenosing lesions of supra-aortic vessels (author's transl). The ultrasonographic results of 158 patients with cerebro-vascular diseases were compared with the angiographic features. The results of the degree of the arterial stenoses correlated well in 66%. In 24% the ultrasonographic findings were false negative, in 10% they were false positive. With regard to the intentions of the centers of vascular surgery to operate as early as possible the ultrasound must be regarded as a screening method. The angiography is still necessary for the operation proceeding.
