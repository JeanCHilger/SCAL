Renal angioplasty for hypertension: predictive factors for long-term success. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was performed in 31 hypertensive patients with primary success in 26 patients (83%). Twenty-three patients had a mean follow-up of 13 months. The cure rate was 30% with a further 26% being improved. However, in the group of patients with lateralizing renal vein renin values, the cure rate rose to 47% with a further 33% improved. Of the eight patients with fibromuscular disease, 83% were normotensive without medication at follow-up in the 13 patients with atherosclerotic disease, 22% were cured and 44% were classified as improved. Patients with fibromuscular disease and lateralization of renin production are the best candidates for long-term success.
