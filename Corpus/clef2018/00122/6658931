Middle cerebral artery perfusion pressure in cerebrovascular occlusive disease. We measured the MCAP (middle cerebral artery pressure)/MSBP (mean systemic blood pressure) ratio in 76 patients who underwent an EIAB (extracranial-intracranial arterial bypass). Patients were divided into groups on the basis of angiographic findings. We found a definite correlation between increasing angiographic cerebral vascular occlusive disease and lower MCAP/MSBP ratios. Six of 32 patients with a preoperative neurologic deficit demonstrated mild but definite postoperative neurologic improvement. The mean MCAP/MSBP ratio in these six patients was significantly lower than that for the remainder of this group (p less than .05). Finally, postoperative filling of the middle cerebral artery territory through the graft was found to correlate in an inverse linear relationship with MCAP/MSBP. Evidence is presented that hypoperfusion produced by occlusion of major cranial vessels plays an important role in temporary and permanent neurological deficits seen in patients with cerebrovascular disease.
