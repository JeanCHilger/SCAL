Lipohemarthrosis of the elbow joint. Radiographic demonstration of three cases of lipohemarthrosis of the elbow is discussed. Lipohemarthrosis is superior to posterior fat pad as a more specific sign of elbow trauma because posterior fat pad merely indicates increased intra-articular pressure while lipohemarthrosis is due only to intracapsular fracture or cartilage and/or ligament injury. Little fat accumulated in the anterior compartment of the joint can be demonstrated by horizontal-beam technique and lipohemarthrosis may conceivably be observed before posterior fat pad is displaced dorsally. With horizontal-beam technique, the patient is more comfortable and it seems unnecessary to irradiate the other elbow.
