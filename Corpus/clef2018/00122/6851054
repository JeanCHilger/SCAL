Effects of aging on changing arterial compliance and left ventricular load in a northern Chinese urban community. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured by means of transcutaneous Doppler techniques in the aorta, right arm, and right leg of 480 normal subjects of both sexes in urban Beijing, China (age range 3 to 89 years, mean age 41 +/- 20.8 SD) supine blood pressure was recorded in the brachial artery of each subject with standard sphygmomanometric procedures. Serum cholesterol was determined in a subgroup of 79 subjects (age 17 to 85 years, mean 47 +/- 26 SD). PWV (y in cm/sec) was found to vary with age (x, years) at each of the three locations according to the following regression equations: aorta, y = 9.2x + 615, r = .673 (p less than .001)
