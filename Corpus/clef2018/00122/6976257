Coronary artery bypass surgery a stimulus to modify existing risk factors? Coronary arterial atherosclerosis is known to be associated with the risk factors of a positive family history, smoking, systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and elevated serum cholesterol levels. Modification of these risk factors, where possible, is prudent. The risk factor data of 226 (212 men, 14 women) subjects who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery for symptomatic obstructive coronary artery disease are presented. Prior to surgery, an attempt was made to educate the subjects in regard to the risk factors and they were urged to modify these factors. All underwent repeat evaluation one year after operation. Although over half of the subjects had had a prior myocardial infarction and all had had aortocoronary bypass surgery, strong stimuli to modify risk factors, there was little modification of the risk factors of smoking and serum cholesterol. There was some modification of the hypertension risk factor. This study documents the need for a very early approach in life to prevent acquiring risk factors and the need for more research into better methods of behavior modification in the adult population.
