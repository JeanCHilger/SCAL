Strain gauge plethysmographic studies after clipping of the inferior vena cava. Assessment of the hemodynamic effects of the IVC clipping by strain gauge plethysmography provides accurate quantitative data. These correlate very well with the other means of investigation used in the study. Eight patients were controlled in the Vascular Laboratory 9 to 43 months after clipping of the inferior vena cava. They submitted to clinical evaluation, Doppler ultrasound, isotopic venography, abdominal sonography, and strain gauge plethysmography of the lower extremities. This last method provided quantitative data maximal venous outflow was found to be equivalent in the 8 patients included in the study and in a control group of 20 healthy young volunteers. Strain gauge plethysmography results correlate well with the other means of investigation and demonstrate the efficacy of the dilated venous collateral channels in restoring a normal venous return.
