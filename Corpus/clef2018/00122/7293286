Poststenotic systolic pressure and blood flow measurements during intra-arterial and vasoactive therapy. In 34 male patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease of the lower extremities the individual responsibility to an intraarterial adenosine triphosphate infusion was tested with the help of Doppler-sonographic poststenotic measurements of the systolic blood pressure as well as comparatively to this by determination of the arterial blood-flow in rest in the region of the calf. While the greater part of the patients with occlusive disease reacted with a significant increase of the blood supply, nearly with the same frequency a decrease of pressure or no change could be established concerning the behaviour of the peripheral pressure. For the judgment of the efficacy of an intraarterial infusion treatment in the acute experiment plethysmographic measurements of the blood-flow are, therefore, more suitable and should be preferred to Doppler-sonographic pressure parameters. As to the controls of long-term therapy under conservative treatment as well as for the judgment of the success in the reconstructive surgery of vessels, however, the post-stenotic measurements of the pressure stood the test apart from further methods in clinical practice.
