The ocular pulse (author's transl). The author discusses the possibilities of registering the ocular pulse. With the help of sphygmography, the so-called pressure pulse can be registered. These techniques yield information about carotid arterial occlusive disease. The purpose of plethysmography is to measure the extent of intraocular blood flow. Yet quantitative determination of the intraocular blood flow rate is not yet possible. The author gives a critical review of the various methods and their limitations.
