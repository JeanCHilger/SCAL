Study of arterial diseases of the lower limbs using an exercise test monitored by Doppler effect ultrasonometry. A study has been carried out using Doppler ultrasonometry on 223 cases, 191 of them suffering from occlusive or stenosing arterial illnesses and 12 with deep massive venous thrombosis, together with 68 control cases. Systolic tensions in the popliteal, dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis arteries, both at rest and after a conveniently standardized effort, were studied every five minutes over periods of up to thirty minutes. The results are shown grouping these patients according to their clinical features and giving their different responses to the test. Special emphasis is given to cases of badly compensated recent intermittent claudication, diffused atheromatosis, asymtomatic arterial stenosis, thromboangiitis obliterans, Leriche's syndrome and hypertensive ulcers.
