Skin perfusion pressure on the legs measured as the external pressure required for skin reddening after blanching: a photo-electric technique compared to isotope washout. The skin perfusion on the calf was measured photo-electrically and by isotope washout technique using external counter pressure by a blood pressure cuff. By the photocell the skin blanching threshold external pressure (BTEP) was recorded on histamine flared red skin. By isotope washout technique the skin blood flow cessation external pressure (FCEP) was recorded using intra-dermal [131I-]-antipyrine mixed with histamine in estimating the skin blood flow. The external pressure was measured with an airfilled plastic cushion connected to a mercury manometer. Over a wide range of pressures as obtained from twenty patients with occlusive arterial disease of the legs, five normal subjects and eleven patients treated for arterial hypertension the values of the two different methods were highly significantly correlated (r = 0.97, P < 0.001). On average the BTEP was equal to the FCEP: 83.9 mmHg (range 18-187) compared to 80.8 mmHg (range 18-158) (P > 0.1). A normal material was obtained from twenty-four subjects measured on the thigh, calf and ankle the average gradients between the auscultatory brachial mean blood pressure and the BTEP were: thigh 10.7 mmHg (SD 12.7)
