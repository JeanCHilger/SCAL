Role of early postoperative surface echocardiography in the pediatric cardiac intensive care unit. To compare surface echocardiographic data with catheterization and surgical observation as a way of deciding on the need to reoperate to correct hemodynamically important sequelae following pediatric cardiac surgery to determine the false-negative diagnosis rate of surface echocardiography.Case series.Tertiary-care center, pediatric cardiac intensive care unit.All 39 patients who underwent reoperation because of hemodynamically significant anatomic sequelae following primary or elective secondary surgery in 1 calendar year.None.Two-dimensional and color Doppler ultrasound assessment of anatomy and physiology following cardiac surgery.In 85 percent, surface echocardiography provided sufficient information for surgeons to reoperate on the same admission. Detection of important residual shunts or arterial stenoses and identification of anatomic causes of pulmonary undercirculation (or overcirculation) in palliated single ventricle are feasible.Early postoperative surface echocardiography is a viable way to decide on the hemodynamic adequacy of cardiac surgery.
