The effects of tertatolol on lipid profile. Tertatolol is a noncardioselective beta-blocker without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. In a preliminary 3-month open study, it was shown that T was devoid of any atherogenic effect since HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) and apoprotein levels did not change for 3 months of therapy. To investigate the long-term effects of tertatolol on the lipid profile and its safety in hypertensive patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD), a 9-month, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study was carried out in 40 patients. Tertatolol 5 mg once daily was compared with metoprolol 200 mg once daily. If BP was not controlled after 2 months, a vasodilatator agent, dihydralazine, was added at the lowest dose required to control BP (diastolic BP < 90 mm Hg). Lipoprotein fractions and apoproteins were assayed before (M0) and after 2, 6 and 9 months of therapy. At the same occasions, peripheral arterial disease (PAD) was evaluated on exercise tests carried out on a treadmill and on the regional blood flow measured in the ankle arteries by the Doppler technique. Four patients were not eligible for analysis. In the tertatolol group, 1 patient with a normal BP, and 2 patients who dropped out, 1 because of persistent nausea and 1 because of personal reasons. In the metoprolol group, 1 patient refused to take dihydralazine. In the 35 fully documented patients, BP control was achieved in both groups. The mean reductions in supine systolic/diastolic BP were 31.4/14.6 and 34.7/17.1 mm Hg in the tertatolol and metoprolol groups, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
