Serum beta-hexosaminidase isoenzymes are related to risk factors for atherosclerosis in a large population of postmenopausal women. Lysosomes are involved in atherogenesis. Therefore we have studied the level of serum beta-hexosaminidase isoenzymes (Hex A and Hex B) in relation to risk factors for atherosclerosis in a homogeneous population of 886 post-menopausal women. We found a relation with several risk factors such as serum triglycerides, diastolic and systolic blood pressure, blood glucose, waist/hip ratio and body mass index but not with serum cholesterol. Also, the mean values for Hex A and Hex B were higher in smokers than in non-smokers but only the mean value for Hex A differed significantly. The relation of serum beta-hexosaminidase isoenzymes to risk factors might be due to lysosomal over-loading, which gives rise to increased enzyme synthesis and enhanced secretion of lysosomal enzymes to circulation. The subjects in the 95-100 percentile of Hex A showed significantly increased frequency of myocardial infarction of their fathers and of stroke in their mothers and the subjects in the 95-100 percentile of Hex B showed increased frequency of stroke in their mothers. Thus the findings of a relation between Hex isoenzymes and heredity for vascular disease further stress the significant relation between Hex isoenzymes and risk factors. Since Hex B is a sensitive marker for alcohol abuse, we also investigated its serum level in subjects that could be suspected of alcohol abuse. However, we did not find any differences in these subjects compared with the others, possibly due to the relatively short half-life of Hex B after alcohol withdrawal.
