The relationship between subjective vasospastic complaints and finger blood flow measurements in Raynaud's phenomenon. Objective circulatory tests in patients with Raynaud's phenomenon have only rarely been related to subjective complaints.In 55 Raynaud patients the correlation between daily self-recorded frequency, duration and severity of vasospastic attacks and the measurement of finger skin blood flow during local cooling was investigated.No significant correlations were found between complaints as registered in the diaries and finger skin temperature and laser Doppler flux before, during and after a standardized local cooling procedure.Finger skin blood flow measurements do not necessarily reflect digital vasospasm in daily life. Besides studies on the diagnostic value and reproducibility of skin blood flow measurements in Raynaud's phenomenon, the relationship of test results to subjective complaints should be established.
