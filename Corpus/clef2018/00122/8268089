Operative transluminal laser angioplasty as the sole treatment for late stenoses of femorodistal artery bypass graft: experimental and clinical studies. To determine the role of Nd:YAG laser thermal angioplasty as the sole treatment for late stenoses of femorodistal artery bypass graft, the lasing effect of a larger size of hot-tip probe (3, 4, and 5 mm) was experimentally studied in vitro. For an adequate lasing effect, 30 watts of laser power output for 3 seconds was needed for the 3 mm probe, 40 watts for the 4 mm probe, and 50 watts for the 5 mm probe, respectively. Based on these results, we used Nd:YAG laser thermal angioplasty alone for 25 grafts, including 16 polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts, eight saphenous vein grafts, and one externally supported (EXS) Dacron graft in which the stenotic lesions were detected by deterioration of the Doppler flow waveform pattern or a significant fall in the ankle/brachial pressure index (ABPI). Follow-up was from 3 to 24 months (average of 9 months) for PTFE grafts, from 5 to 21 months (average of 11 months) for saphenous vein grafts, and 13 months for the EXS Dacron graft following femorodistal artery reconstructions. Stenotic lesions were most common in the distal anastomotic sites: 11 PTFE grafts, three saphenous vein grafts, and one EXS Dacron graft. Among these, 13 grafts showed a type II flow waveform pattern at the time of surgery. Clinical success was achieved in 12 of the PTFE grafts (75%), in five of the vein grafts (62.5%), and in the single EXS Dacron graft. Four PTFE and three saphenous vein grafts failed subsequent to repeat intraoperative balloon angioplasty in three and graft extension in three and one graft interposition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
