Clinically relevant diaphragmatic dysfunction after cardiac operations. Phrenic nerve injury and diaphragmatic dysfunction can be induced by cardiac operation. The clinical consequences are not well-established. We evaluated 13 consecutive patients over a 2-year period with unexplained and prolonged difficulties in weaning from mechanical ventilation. The mean time of measurement from the operation day was 31 +/- 19 days (range 8 to 78). With the same technique we also evaluated 12 control patients: four patients at day 1 after cardiac operation while they were still intubated four normally convalescing patients at day 7 or 8 after cardiac operation
