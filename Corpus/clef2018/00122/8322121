Lysis block technique--a new method of fibrinolytic treatment with tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA). With lysis-block technique an over-systolic tourniquet is put on the thigh or upper arm. The fibrinolytic substance is injected into a dorsal foot vein or forearm vein. By using this strictly local lysis it was possible to remove distal venous and arterial occlusions. During over-systolic blockade there was only a minimal link between the blocked part of the limb and systemic circulation. By choosing a lytic substance with a short half-life-period (rt-PA) the systemic effect after loosening the blockade was small. LBT is a new and interesting method for the fibrinolytic treatment of peripheral venous and arterial occlusions. The procedure is characterized by minimal systemic reactions and it can probably be applied in those patients with contraindications for systemic lysis.
