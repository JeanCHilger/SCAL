Colour Doppler velocimetry of the arterial vasculature of the optic nerve head and orbit. Blood flow in the orbital vasculature can be investigated by colour Doppler velocimetry which allows simultaneous imaging of B-scan and Doppler ultrasound. In this paper we review the results of our recent studies on the arterial vasculature of the orbit and optic nerve head. A control study is described in which reliable measurements were obtained from the ophthalmic artery at the orbital apex, the medial orbit, and the complex of the central retinal artery and posterior ciliary arteries. Patients with occlusion of the central retinal artery and posterior ciliary arteries were examined. The results indicate that readings at the optic nerve head primarily represent blood flow in the central retinal artery. A study of the effects of posture on velocimetry demonstrated no change in the measurements obtained. Finally, topical timolol 0.5% was found to reduce the resistive indices of flow in the central retinal artery.
