Use of translesional coronary flow velocity for interventional decisions in a patient with multiple intermediately severe coronary stenoses. Translesional pressure gradients are currently not performed routinely for most angioplasty procedures because of the technical limitations. With the use of an 0.18 inch Doppler flow velocity guidewire, coronary flow velocity, both proximal and distal to a lesion, can be easily assessed. In branching arteries, significant lesions are characterized by a ratio of proximal to distal flow velocity of > 1.7, loss of the normal phasic diastolic predominant flow velocity pattern, and/or loss of distal hyperemia. We describe the use of coronary flow velocity in assisting important decision making in a young patient with a recent myocardial infarction and multiple coronary lesions. The decision for angioplasty of the hemodynamically significant stenosis was confirmed by translesional flow velocity measurements. A rational approach to coronary intervention in patients with multiple stenoses of intermediate severity appears to be facilitated by direct measurement of translesional flow dynamics.
