Prevalence and correlates of lower extremity arterial disease in elderly women. Although lower extremity arterial disease occurs in 15-20% of the population over the age of 75 years, little is known about the etiology of the disease in women. In this cross-sectional study involving 1,601 healthy elderly women (mean age, 71 years range, 65-93 years), the occurrence of lower extremity arterial disease was assessed noninvasively by measuring brachial and ankle pressures bilaterally. Disease prevalence ranged from 2.9% in those aged 65-69 years to 15.5% in those aged 80 years or older. Approximately 20% of those with disease had symptoms of claudication. Age, systolic blood pressure, and current smoking status were strong independent risk factors for arterial disease
