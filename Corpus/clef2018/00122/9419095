Use of color Doppler flow imaging for preoperative assessment in fibular osteoseptocutaneous free tissue transfer. Fibular osteocutaneous free tissue transfer represents state-of-the-art reconstruction of the oromandibular complex after oncologic resection. Because the blood supply of the fibular flap is based on the peroneal artery and venae comitantes, it is essential to determine preoperatively whether adequate perfusion to the donor extremity will persist after sacrifice of the peroneal pedicle. Vascular variations or peripheral arterial occlusive disease may exist whereby sacrifice of peroneal vessels can cause ischemia of the lower leg and foot. Therefore, angiography of the lower extremity and magnetic resonance angiography have been advocated to determine the arterial supply to the lower leg. Though accurate, these examinations carry risk for morbidity, and both are expensive. Color Doppler flow imaging is a noninvasive ultrasound examination used to measure antegrade and retrograde blood flow. We prospectively evaluated color Doppler flow imaging as a means of preoperative evaluation of the lower extremity for candidates for fibular flaps. Ability to image peroneal vessels and to determine collateral and distal perfusion were evaluated. The patients were compared with a control group of patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Color Doppler flow imaging provided accurate hemodynamic information for all patients and allowed successful fibular transfer for all patients who received free flaps. The modality is comparable in accuracy with the angiography of the lower extremity and magnetic resonance angiography and has the advantages of low cost and no morbidity.
