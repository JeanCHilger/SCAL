Cerebral effects in superior vena caval cannula obstruction: the role of brain monitoring. A pediatric cardiac case of transient obstruction of the superior vena cava by the venous cannula before cardiopulmonary bypass is presented. With venous obstruction and increase in central venous pressure, reduced cerebral blood flow velocities and absence of diastolic Doppler flow were detected. This was followed by regional cerebral venous oxygen desaturation and global electroencephalographic slowing. Reposition of the venous cannula led to the recovery of these physiologic indicators and a noncomplicated clinical outcome.
