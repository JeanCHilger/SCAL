Comparison of responses evoked by mild indirect cooling and by sound in the forearm vasculature in patients with homozygous sickle cell disease and in normal subjects. In normal individuals, novel or noxious stimuli commonly evoke the pattern of the alerting or defence response which includes cutaneous vasoconstriction, but vasodilatation in forearm skeletal muscle. We have compared cardiovascular responses evoked by sound and by indirect cooling in 60 patients with homozygous sickle cell (SS) disease and in 30 control subjects with normal haemoglobin genotype (AA). A sound of 90 dB, 1 kHz for 30s evoked an increase in hand and forearm cutaneous vascular resistance (HCVR and FCVR) in SS patients and an increase in HCVR in AA subjects, as assessed from Doppler flowmetry. Meanwhile, a decrease in forearm vascular resistance (FVR) assessed by venous occlusion plethysmography, occurred in 14 out of 30 AA subjects and 25 out of 60 SS patients, indicating vasodilatation in forearm muscle an increase in FVR occurred in the remainder. The proportions of SS patients and AA subjects who showed an increase in FVR (53% vs 57%) were not significantly different. Cooling increased HCVR and FCVR in SS patients and increased FCVR in AA subjects
