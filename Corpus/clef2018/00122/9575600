The relationship between free-living daily physical activity and the severity of peripheral arterial occlusive disease. The purposes of this study were to assess the magnitude of the reduction in free-living daily physical activity of claudicants compared with age-matched controls, and to examine the relationship between the severity of peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) and free-living daily physical activity. Eighty-five PAOD patients with intermittent claudication and 59 non-PAOD subjects with a resting ankle/brachial index (ABI) of 0.63 +/- 0.20 and 1.21 +/- 0.08, respectively, were monitored for 2 consecutive weekdays with an accelerometer and pedometer worn on each hip. The times to onset and to maximal claudication pain were also measured in the claudicants during a graded treadmill test to assess the functional limitations imposed by PAOD. The PAOD group had a 42% lower energy expenditure as measured from the accelerometer (357 +/- 238 kcal/day versus 616 +/- 363 kcal/day p < 0.001) and a 45% lower pedometer reading (4737 +/- 2712 steps/day versus 8672 +/- 4235 steps/day
