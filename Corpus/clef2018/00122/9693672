Compression therapy with medical elastic stockings for venous diseases. Compression therapy is the cornerstone in the treatment of venous disease. In many cases, but especially for the maintenance of compression, medical elastic compression stockings (MECS) are being used. Preprescription investigation includes determining the severity of venous insufficiency and the arterial system. An ankle/arm index < 0.6 will be the contraindication for compression therapy. MECS can be divided in flat-knitted and round-knitted MECS. Flat-knitted MECS can be made tailor sized, with a tolerance up to 0.5 cm. Several classes of MECS are characterized by the elasticity coefficient (EC) of the used elastic threads. The stiffer the stocking (high EC), the better a MECS will prevent edema formation during the day, but the more difficult it is to put them on. MECS with a high EC are always flat-knitted. Most round-knitted MECS will last 4-6 months, and flat-knitted MECS, 6-9 months.The physician can prescribe MECS for a wide variety of venous and some other diseases. He can determine the amount of compression as well as the stiffness of the MECS.Only a well-motivated patient and an experienced physician together are able to ensure ongoing successful compression therapy with MECS.
