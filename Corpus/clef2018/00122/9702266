Reactive hyperemic response of the brachial artery: comparison of proximal and distal occlusion. The authors compared the postocclusion hyperemic responses of the brachial artery after occluding blood flow proximal to and distal to the studied area.Response of the brachial artery to hypoxia was evaluated with duplex Doppler ultrasound in 13 healthy subjects. A pneumatic tourniquet was first positioned 2-5 cm superior to the left elbow, proximal to the area of artery studied. Two hours later the response was remeasured with the tourniquet positioned 2-5 cm inferior to the elbow, distal to the artery studied. Arterial diameter, mean and peak flow velocities, and heart rate were assessed.No significant differences were observed between measurements of baseline and postischemic arterial diameter, percentage diameter change, baseline mean arterial blood flow velocity, baseline peak arterial blood flow velocity, or postischemic heart rate obtained with proximal occlusion of the artery and those obtained with distal occlusion. In contrast, mean and peak postischemic arterial blood flow velocity and preocclusion heart rate were higher in measurements made during proximal artery occlusion. Significant correlation was found between measurements of percentage change in artery diameter obtained with proximal artery occlusion and those obtained with distal occlusion (r = 0.611, P < .05).There are no major differences in postischemic changes in brachial artery diameter related to reactive hyperemia between blood flow occlusion applied proximal and distal to the studied area. However, there are significant differences in the mean and peak systolic velocities. Either occlusion site can be used for clinical studies if arterial diameter change is monitored, but if velocity measurements are being compared, a single occlusion site should be chosen.
