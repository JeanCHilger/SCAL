Age-related changes in cochlear blood flow response to occlusion of anterior inferior cerebellar artery in mice. Previous studies suggest that autoregulation of cochlear blood flow (CBF) may be impaired by aging. In this study, we quantified the capacity of CBF autoregulation in young adult (6-month-old) and aged (21-month-old) CBA mice, to examine the effect of aging on CBF autoregulation. The technique of anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) occlusion was employed to manipulate cochlear perfusion pressure. The CBF was measured by laser Doppler flowmetry during intermittent occlusion of the AICA with a microvascular clamp, which causes an initial decrease in CBF. The autoregulation of CBF was evaluated by quantifying the CBF increase (compensatory dilatory response in the cochlear vessels) during AICA occlusion. Our results demonstrated that autoregulation of CBF was significantly reduced and that collateral vascular function supplying CBF was significantly lower in the aged group. These findings suggest that the aged ear has less capacity to maintain stable blood flow and thus may be more vulnerable to stress factors that affect cochlear function.
