Factors determining cardiac hypertrophy in hypertensive patients with or without peripheral vascular disease. 1. Coronary ischaemic disease and congestive heart failure are the principal causes of mortality in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Whether cardiac hypertrophy is present and even more pronounced in peripheral vascular disease than in other populations has never been explored.2.Twenty-five hypertensive patients were investigated, 11 without and 14 with peripheral vascular disease, matched for age, sex, mean arterial pressure and antihypertensive drug treatment. Cardiac mass was determined using echocardiography together with measurement of systemic blood pressure, ratio between ankle systolic pressure (ASP) and brachial systolic pressure (BSP), and standard biochemical parameters including natriuresis per 24 h.3. At the same mean arterial pressure, patients with peripheral vascular disease had a significantly higher cardiac mass (157+/-12 versus 116+/-6 g/m2 P<0.01), pulse pressure (81+/-5 versus 55+/-4 mmHg
