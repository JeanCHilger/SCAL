Microsphere infusion reverses vasoconstrictor-mediated change in hindlimb oxygen uptake and energy status. The vasoconstrictors, angiotensin II (AII) and serotonin (5-HT) produce opposing metabolic effects and appear to control different flow routes in the constant-flow perfused rat hindlimb. In the present study the association between vascular flow route recruitment and metabolism was assessed by selective microsphere embolism of either route. Microspheres (MS, 11.9 +/- 0.1 microns, mean +/- SE diameter) were injected during AII, 5-HT or vehicle infusions (basal conditions) and the effects on hindlimb (4.7 +/- 0.1 g muscle) oxygen uptake (VO2) and indices of energy status CrP/Cr, CrP/ATP and energy charge (EC) of the calf muscle group assessed. MS (1.5 x 10(6)) injected during vehicle, or 5-HT infusion increased VO2 (P < 0.05) but did not affect energy status. During AII, MS decreased VO2. Change in VO2 correlated positively with CrP/Cr (r = 0.68, P < 0.0001) and CrP/ATP (r = 0.51, P < 0.001) but not EC (r = 0.08, P = 0.59). MS (1.5 x 10(6)) increased pressure but did not affect the flow rate. The metabolic changes resulting from 1.5 x 10(6) microspheres were intensified by a second injection of 1.5 x 10(6) microspheres but further injection (> 3.0 x 10(6) microspheres) began to inhibit flow. It is concluded that a finite number (< or = 3.0 x 10(6)) of microspheres of 11.9 microns diameter has opposite effects on VO2 depending on the vasoconstrictor present and that these effects result from the occlusion of the different vascular route accessed by each vasoconstrictor. The data support the proposal that hindlimb metabolism can be controlled by vasoconstrictors as a result of selective vascular recruitment.
