Determinants of fibrinogen in an Italian population suffering from claudication. Lower fibrinogen in the south compared to middle and north of Italy. The ADEP Group. Prospective studies have shown that high plasma levels of fibrinogen are independently associated with the risk of cardiovascular complications. In patients suffering from peripheral vascular disease (PVD) fibrinogen has been shown to be an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease but its determinants have never been examined in this clinical setting.Fibrinogen levels were related to clinical and laboratory variables in 2,111 patients suffering from PVD. We also analyzed whether there was a regional distribution of risk factors.The median values of fibrinogen was 312 mg/dL. The clinical variables examined did not differentiate patients with elevated or normal fibrinogen levels. In particular, patients with ankle/arm pressure ratio < 0.8 did not show a higher prevalence of fibrinogen > 312 mg/dL. Conversely, white blood cell (WBC) count and serum cholesterol levels were significantly associated with high fibrinogen levels (p < 0.0001). Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that areas of Italy were differently associated with high plasma fibrinogen levels (p < 0.03): subjects in the north and middle of Italy having significantly higher values of fibrinogen than subjects in the south of Italy (p < 0.01). A similar regional distribution was observed for WBC count and serum cholesterol levels.The regional distribution of risk factors raises the question as to whether the already reported large variability of cardiovascular events so in PVD may be attributed to a non homogeneous distribution of risk factors.
