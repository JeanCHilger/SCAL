Myocardial oxygen consumption after major coronary artery occlusion in anaesthetized dogs with constant left ventricular workload. In dog preparations with fixed external workload, reduction of functioning myocardium from 13.3 to 40.9 degrees by coronary artery occlusion (CAO) did not affect myocardial oxygen consumption for periods up to 77 min following CAO. Thus, the use of reserve capacity supplementing equal functional loss of myocardium does not alter oxygen consumption.
