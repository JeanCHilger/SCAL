Review of the assessment of single level and multilevel arterial occlusive disease in lower limbs by duplex ultrasound. The purpose of this article is to review the performance of duplex ultrasound scanning in assessing lower limb arterial disease with emphasis on patients with multisegmental occlusive lesions. Several studies have reported that duplex scanning can be as accurate as angiography to localize arterial stenoses. In spite of these promising results, there still remain some difficulties and controversies. Among them, it has been reported that multisegmental disease may affect the accuracy of duplex scanning. Indeed, some studies have indicated a lower sensitivity for detecting significant stenoses distal to severe or total occlusions. It also was demonstrated that second-order stenoses were detected with lower sensitivity compared to first-order stenoses. The main reason proposed to explain this lower sensitivity is that the highly reduced flow distal to occluded or highly stenotic segments increases the difficulty of detecting significant Doppler velocity changes in the distal or secondary stenoses. The intrinsic limitations of the peak systolic velocity ratio used as a classification criterion are presented. Finally, new and promising developments in power Doppler imaging and ultrasound contrast agents are discussed, because they may allow expansion of the capabilities of current ultrasound scanning systems and provide more accurate diagnosis of patients with multiple disease.
