Velocity and wall shear stress patterns in the human right coronary artery. Blood flow dynamics in the human right coronary artery have not been adequately quantified despite the clinical significance of coronary atherosclerosis. In this study, a technique was developed to construct a rigid flow model from a cast of a human right coronary artery. A laser photochromic method was used to characterize the velocity and wall shear stress patterns. The flow conditions include steady flow at Reynolds numbers of 500 and 1000 as well as unsteady flow with Womersley parameter and peak Reynolds number of 1.82 and 750, respectively. Characterization of the three-dimensional geometry of the artery revealed that the largest spatial variation in curvature occurred within the almost branch-free proximal region, with the greatest curvature existing along the acute margin of the heart. In the proximal segment, high shear stresses were observed on the outer wall and lower, but not negative, stresses along the inner wall. Low shear stress on the inner wall may be related to the preferential localization of atherosclerosis in the proximal segment of the right coronary artery. However, it is possible that the large difference between the outer and inner wall shear stresses may also be involved.
