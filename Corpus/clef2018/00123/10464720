Pneumatic ankle tourniquets: physiological factors related to minimal arterial occlusion pressure. This study investigates several physiological measurements for their correlation to the minimal arterial occlusion pressure using the pneumatic ankle tourniquet. Blood pressure (brachial), height, weight, body fat percentage, ankle circumference, and leg circumference measurements were collected from 50 normotensive healthy subjects. Ankle brachial index (ABI) was also compared. A pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied to the right ankle and inflated until Doppler insonation confirmed that arterial occlusion had occurred. Mean arterial occlusion pressure was 161.7 mm Hg (N = 50, Nmales = 33, Nfemales = 17), and statistically less than 170 mm Hg (p < .05). The authors present a data model to predict the lowest necessary ankle tourniquet pressure for this study group. Forward stepwise linear regression (critical significance = .01) yields two variables, ankle brachial index and systolic blood pressure, which are used to predict occlusion pressure in this study group.
