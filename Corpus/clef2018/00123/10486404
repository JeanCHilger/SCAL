Prevalence and frequency of microembolic signals in 105 patients with extracranial carotid artery occlusive disease. Besides the established factors "presence of symptoms" and "degree of stenosis", plaque echolucency is considered to be associated with increased risk of stroke in patients with carotid artery disease. An evaluation was carried out as to whether the prevalence and number of microembolic signals (MES) detected by transcranial Doppler ultrasound were higher in patients with echolucent carotid plaques. One hundred and five patients with carotid artery stenosis from 20%-99% or occlusion underwent clinical investigations, duplex ultrasound of the carotid arteries, and a 1 hour recording from the middle cerebral artery downstream to the carotid artery pathology using the four gate technique. The presence of MES was more frequent and the number greater in symptomatic patients (21 out of 64 patients (33%) mean number of MES in all 64 patients 3.1) than in asymptomatic patients (four out of 41 patients (10%)
