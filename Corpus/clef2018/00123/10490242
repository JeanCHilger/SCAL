Oxidation of LDL and extent of peripheral atherosclerosis. Evidence has accumulated for oxidative modification of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) to play an important role in the atherogenic process. Therefore, we investigated the relation between susceptibility of LDL to oxidation and risk of peripheral atherosclerosis among 249 men between 45 and 80 years of age. The ankle-arm index was calculated for both legs as the ratio of systolic blood pressure in the leg divided by the arm systolic blood pressure. The lowest of both ankle-arm indices was used to categorize subjects. Thirty-nine men with an ankle-arm index < 1.00 (20% cut-off point of distribution) were classified as subjects with peripheral atherosclerosis. Subjects with peripheral atherosclerosis reported more often the use of a special diet and the use of antihypertensive medication, aspirin and coumarin derivatives. No significant differences in total, LDL and HDL cholesterol and triglycerides were present between groups. Resistance time and maximum rate of oxidation were measured ex vivo using copper-induced LDL oxidation. Subjects with peripheral atherosclerosis had a significantly lower resistance time, whereas the maximum rate of oxidation tended to be increased in subjects with peripheral atherosclerosis. Odds ratios (ORs, and 95% confidence interval) for the successive tertiles of resistance time were 1.00 (reference), 0.37 (0.15-0.89) and 0.37 (0.16-0.86) (p(trend) < 0.01). ORs for the successive tertiles of maximum rate of oxidation were 1.00 (reference), 1.34 (0.47-3.82) and 1.50 (0.55-4.15). This inverse association was borderline significant (p(trend) = 0.07). These results support an association between LDL oxidation and the development of peripheral atherosclerosis.
