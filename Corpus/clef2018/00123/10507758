Iontophoretic current and intradermal microdialysis recovery in humans. When microdialysis (MD) is used to study dermal delivery by iontophoresis, the effects of current may alter MD recovery through an increase in temperature, a change of pH, hyperemia, and dermal hydration. The objective of this work is to assess whether these effects of current may cause a measurable change in the retrodialysis of a model compound (sodium fluorescein, Fl). Two linear MD-probes were inserted in the forearm dermis of healthy human volunteers and perfused with Ringer's solution containing Fl. Two identical iontophoresis chambers (IC, filled with NaCl in propylene glycol) were placed over the MD-probes. Each IC included a laser Doppler flowmetry probe to monitor skin blood flow. At one IC, current was applied for two periods of 30 min each, separated by 30 min of no current. No current was applied to the control site. Dialysate samples were collected every 5 min and analyzed for Fl by HPLC. Skin blood flow increased in response to iontophoresis, on average, 570% compared to the control site. However, there was no difference in the recovery of Fl between the current-active site versus the control site, and between the period with applied current versus the period with no current. In conclusion, iontophoretic current did not affect intradermal MD recovery.
