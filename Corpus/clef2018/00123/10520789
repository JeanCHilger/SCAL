Final results of the STent versus directional coronary Atherectomy Randomized Trial (START) This study was designed to compare primary stenting with optimal directional coronary atherectomy (DCA).No previous prospective randomized trial comparing stenting and DCA has been performed.One hundred and twenty-two lesions suitable for both Palmaz-Schatz stenting and DCA were randomly assigned to stent (62 lesions) or DCA (60 lesions) arm. Single or multiple stents were implanted with high-pressure dilation in the stent arm. Aggressive debulking using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) was performed in the DCA arm. Serial quantitative angiography and IVUS were performed preprocedure, postprocedure and at six months. The primary end point was restenosis, defined as > or =50% diameter stenosis at six months. Clinical event rates at one year were also assessed.Baseline characteristics were similar. Procedural success was achieved in all lesions. Although the postprocedural lumen diameter was similar (2.79 vs. 2.90 mm, stent vs. DCA), the follow-up lumen diameter was significantly smaller (1.89 vs. 2.18 mm p = 0.023) in the stent arm. The IVUS revealed that intimal proliferation was significantly larger in the stent arm than in the DCA arm (3.1 vs. 1.1 mm These results suggest that aggressive DCA may provide superior angiographic and clinical outcomes to primary stenting.
