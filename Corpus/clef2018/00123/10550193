In vivo femoropopliteal arterial wall compliance in subjects with and without lower limb vascular disease. The purpose of this study was to further the development of a compliant vascular graft with a preliminary assessment of the elastic properties of the femoropopliteal artery in subjects with and without lower limb peripheral vascular disease.This prospective controlled study was set in a university department of surgery. Using an ultrasound scan wall tracking system with the simultaneous measurement of brachial blood pressure, measurements of femoropopliteal artery wall motion were undertaken in 11 patients with peripheral vascular disease (group 1), in 11 older control subjects who were matched for blood pressure, age, and sex (group 2), and in 12 younger control subjects (group 3). Diametrical compliance and stiffness index were determined for the common femoral artery, the proximal superficial femoral artery, the distal superficial femoral artery (DSFA), and the midgenicular popliteal artery.All the arterial segments in group 1 showed a trend towards increased stiffness and less compliance than the group 2, age-matched control vessels, with significantly lower distensibility noted at the common femoral artery (mean compliance of 6.2% vs 14.1% mm Hg(-1) x 10(-2), respectively P <.05) and the DSFA (mean compliance of 2.2% vs 1.9% mm Hg(-1) x 10(-2), respectivelyLower limb peripheral vascular disease is associated with a reduction in femoropopliteal artery elasticity. Age alone appears to have a minimal effect on the compliance of the proximal half of the femoropopliteal segment. The elastic properties of the femoropopliteal vessel are subject to marked variation along its course. To minimize compliance mismatch, the degree of elasticity engineered into a vascular graft must reflect that observed in vivo.
