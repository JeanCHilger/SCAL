A new rotational thrombectomy catheter: system design and first clinical experiences. To describe a new catheter for the percutaneous mechanical removal of fresh and organized thrombi, and to assess its efficacy and safety in vitro and in vivo.The catheter consists of a coated stainless steel spiral that rotates at 40,000 rpm over a guidewire inside the whole length of an 8 Fr, single-lumen, polyurethane catheter, driving a dual-blade cutting crown. Abraded occlusion material is sucked into the catheter head through distal side holes and transported by the spiral into a reservoir at the proximal end. The efficacy of the device was tested in arterial models and fresh bovine carotid arteries (n = 72). In a clinical pilot study 10 patients (8 women, 2 men mean age 70.6 +/- 10.1 years) with occlusions of the superficial femoral artery (2-12 cm, mean 5.8 cm), not older than 4 weeks, underwent thrombectomy with the new catheter.In arterial models and bovine cadaver arteries the catheter completely removed fresh thrombi. Occlusion material of higher consistency was cut into particles of 100-500 micron and transported outside. Thrombectomy was successful and vessel patency restored in all 10 patients. The ankle/brachial pressure index significantly (p < 0.0005) increased from 0.41 +/- 0. 18 before intervention to 0.88 +/- 0.15 after 48 hr and to 0.84 +/- 0.20 after 3 months. Two reocclusions occurred within 14 days after the intervention.Thrombectomy with the new device appears to be feasible and safe in patients with acute and subacute occlusions of the femoropopliteal artery.
