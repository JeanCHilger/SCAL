Relationship between endothelial cell markers and arterial stenosis in peripheral and carotid artery disease. Damage to the endothelium is an important component of atherosclerosis and can be quantified by measuring plasma markers, such as von Willebrand factor, thrombomodulin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and E-selectin. We hypothesized that increased levels of these markers would be related to objectively defined disease severity among patients with peripheral atherosclerosis or carotid atherosclerosis. To test this, we measured the markers by using ELISA in the plasma of 45 patients with intermittent claudication alone and in 53 patients presenting with transient ischemic attack. Disease severity in the former was by ankle-brachial pressure index and in the latter by ultrasound defined % stenosis. Any symptomatic dual disease or history or present coronary atherosclerosis warranted exclusion. Data were correlated according to Spearman's method. The only significant correlation was between von Willebrand factor and ankle-brachial pressure index (r = -0.39, p = 0.008). Our data suggest that von Willebrand factor is the most sensitive marker of peripheral atherosclerosis and that none of the plasma markers seems to be a useful marker of the degree of carotid artery stenosis.
