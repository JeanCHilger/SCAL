Arterial reconstruction for radial artery occlusion. This study was designed to detail the history and symptoms of symptomatic radial artery vaso-occlusive disease and to evaluate the results of radial artery reconstruction. Thirteen patients with symptomatic vaso-occlusive disease of the radial artery unresponsive to management by nonoperative modalities were managed with arterial reconstruction. All cases were treated with reversed interpositional vein grafting from the radial artery in the forearm (end-to-side) to the deep arch distally (end-to-end). Patients completed preoperative and postoperative assessments of symptoms and function, cold sensitivity (cold intolerance), and digital microvascular perfusion (isolated cold stress test evaluation with laser Doppler fluxmetry). At the follow-up examination all vascular grafts were patent, as determined by Allen's testing and Doppler ultrasound. The patients reported symptoms and functional status that demonstrated significant improvement following reconstruction. Microvascular evaluations demonstrated a significant improvement in digital microvascular perfusion as assessed by laser Doppler fluxmetry and digital temperature recordings with a resultant resolution of ischemic pain, numbness, and ulceration.
