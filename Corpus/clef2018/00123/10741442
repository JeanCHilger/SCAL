Vascular injuries within the hepatoduodenal ligament: recognition by laparoscopic color Doppler ultrasound. Lesions of vascular structures are rare but serious complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The purpose of this blind randomized animal study was to investigate the possibility of detecting different vascular lesions within the hepatoduodenal ligament using laparoscopic color Doppler ultrasound (LCDU).Twenty-four lesions of the hepatic artery and portal vein were created laparoscopically in six farmer pigs using titanium clips. The following injuries were studied: (a) partial occlusion of the hepatic artery (eight cases), (b) complete occlusion of the hepatic artery (eight cases), (c) partial occlusion of the portal vein (eight cases). There were also eight cases without lesions of the vascular vessels. The order in which the injuries were created was randomly assigned. The study was performed in a blind fashion. Recognition of the injuries was attempted with LCDU.All injuries were recognized correctly by LCDU. There were no false positive results. The clips were reliably located. Using color Doppler imaging, partial occlusions of the hepatic artery and portal vein were visualized by changes of the blood flow from laminar to turbulent behind the clip. Complete occlusion of the hepatic artery was recognized as a complete cessation of the colored blood flow.LCDU is a very efficient tool for visualizing vascular structures and evaluating the bloodstream. Partial or complete vascular occlusion by clips that may occur as a result of difficult dissection during laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be visualized reliably using this technique.
