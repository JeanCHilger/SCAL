Helical CT angiography with maximum intensity projection in the assessment of aortic coarctation after surgery. The value of CT angiography and three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions was investigated in the postoperative care after surgical repair of aortic coarctation and compared with conventional angiography.Twenty-five patients referred because of suspicion of stenosis in the area of former coarctation were prospectively studied with CT angiography and catheter angiography. We determined the morphometric and morphologic findings such as aortic diameter, stenosis, aneurysm, intimal flaps, circumscribed pouch, or arteriosclerotic plaques with 3D reconstructions, using maximum-intensity-projection (MIP) technique and catheter angiography. The results of both techniques were compared. The ratio of the narrowest diameters of the former coarctation and the descending aorta was correlated with the systolic pullback blood pressure gradient in all patients.The former coarctation was normal in 11 patients, (44%), group A narrowed in 12 children (48%), group BCT angiography and 3D reconstructions using MIP represent a reliable noninvasive technique to replace diagnostic catheter angiography in the postoperative care of patients with coarctation and provide the clinician with valuable information concerning further invasive procedures.
