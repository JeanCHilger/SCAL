Effects of dobutamine on splanchnic tissue perfusion during partial superior mesenteric artery occlusion. To evaluate the effects of dobutamine and fluid treatment on splanchnic hemodynamics and tissue oxygenation during partial superior mesenteric artery occlusion.Prospective, open randomized, full-factorial design.University research laboratory.Forty-eight female pigs.In 24 anesthetized pigs (ischemic group), superior mesenteric artery (SMA) blood flow was reduced to 30% from the baseline for 120 mins 24 pigs (sham group) served as nonischemic controls. The animals were further assigned into four treatment arms. In the control arm, the animals were administered only basic fluid therapy. In the fluid therapy arm, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure was maintained at 10 mm Hg with fluids. In the dobutamine treatment arm, dobutamine hydrochloride was infused at a dose of 10 microg/min/kg. In the combined dobutamine-fluid therapy arm, dobutamine at 10 microg/min/kg was administered and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure was maintained at 10 mm Hg with fluids.Systemic and regional hemodynamics and oxygen transport, as well as jejunal intramucosal pH, intramucosal-arterial PCO2 gradient, and portal venous-arterial lactate gradient were measured. Ischemia did not modify the effects of fluids or dobutamine on systemic hemodynamics and oxygen transport. Dobutamine-treated animals had a higher cardiac index compared with control animals (218 +/- 22 vs. 135 +/- 13 mL/min/kg p = .012), and the effect was enhanced when dobutamine was combined with fluid treatment (365 +/- 23 mL/ min/kgDobutamine alone worsened splanchnic tissue perfusion during partial superior mesenteric artery occlusion. As compared with fluid treatment alone, the combination of fluid and dobutamine therapy did not improve tissue perfusion.
