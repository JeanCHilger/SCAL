Comparison of bolus and infusion of the ultrasound contrast media levovist for color doppler ultrasound of renal arteries. To investigate if the duration of Doppler enhancement of the ultrasound contrast agent Levovist can be prolonged by continuous infusion compared to bolus injections in patients.12 patients with suspected renal artery stenosis were included. Each patient received 1 or 2 bolus injections of 4 g each and a "fast" infusion of 3 ml/min (average dose: 7 g) of Levovist. In 8 patients an additional "slow" infusion of 1 ml/min (average dose 4.2 g) was given. The duration of "strong" Doppler signal enhancement and the visualization of vessels were compared.The duration of strong enhancement was substantially prolonged by the slow infusion (bolus 6:21 min, fast infusion: 8:57 min, slow infusion: 15:12 min, p < 0.001). The dose effectiveness (duration of strong enhancement per 1 g Levovist) was markedly improved from 0:57 min (bolus) to 3:36 min (slow infusion). Visualisation of the renal arteries was more complete with the slow infusion.Levovist infusions at 1 ml/min are superior to bolus injections in the assessment of renal arteries. They prolong the enhancement, make more efficient use of a given dose of contrast material and thus allow additional clinically relevant information to be obtained at reduced cost.
