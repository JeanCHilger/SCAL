First results after implantation of the new balloon-expanded Bridge-Stent into the iliac artery. To determine the success and patency rates of the new, balloon-expandable Bridge-stents for treatment of occlusions and stenoses of iliac arteries.Between April and October 1999, 21 patients suffering from peripheral arterial occlusive disease were treated (22 lesions). In 20 cases high-grade stenoses and in two cases complete occlusions were treated. 23 balloon-expandable Bridge-stents were implanted in the common iliac (n = 16) and the external iliac (n = 6) artery after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty.All interventions were performed with technical success. The mean ankle-brachial index (ABI) increased from 0.7 +/- 0.19 before to 0.86 +/- 0.16 at 24 hours after the procedure (Rutherford +3 [n = 18] and +2 [n = 3]) the ABI measured after 6 months was 0.89 +/- 0.16. The primary cumulative patency rate amounted to 91% (20/22) at 6 months. In two cases restenosis of 75% were observed, requiring repeated angioplasty.The new balloon-expandable Bridge-stents achieve very good initial technical success and promising short-term patency in the percutaneous treatment of iliac occlusive disease.
