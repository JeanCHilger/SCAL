Hyperechoic middle cerebral artery: acute occlusion detected by transcranial duplex ultrasonography. The authors describe the appearance of acute thromboembolic occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) using transcranial duplex ultrasonography. Acute occlusion of the MCA commonly leads to severe cerebral infarction. In patients with acute MCA occlusion, secondary edema and elevated intracranial pressure are major causes of increased morbidity and mortality. Thus, the prompt detection of occlusion influences early therapy, including thrombolysis and increased control of intracranial pressure. The hyperdense appearance of the acutely occluded MCA as seen using computed tomography (CT) has been extensively reported in the literature. However, its appearance using transcranial duplex ultrasonography has not been reported. The authors report four patients who had clinical features of ischemia throughout the MCA territory. All patients were studied with CT and transcranial duplex ultrasonography within 6 hours of the onset of symptoms. Head CT of all four patients showed a hyperdense MCA sign with infarction of the MCA territory. Transcranial duplex studies using either pulsed Doppler or color Doppler sonography displayed a hyperechoic MCA with no evidence of flow. Subsequent duplex ultrasonography and magnetic resonance angiography showed all four patients had ipsilateral occlusion of the internal carotid artery. Transcranial duplex ultrasonography assists in the early diagnosis of acute MCA occlusion. The affected vessel is displayed as a hyperechoic structure associated with no flow using Doppler examination.
