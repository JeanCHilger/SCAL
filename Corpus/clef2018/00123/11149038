Hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma: MR imaging findings. We describe the sonographic, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging findings of two patients with histologically proven hepatic hemangioendothelioma. Both patients presented with multiple liver nodules. Color Doppler ultrasound demonstrated moderate vascularity at the periphery of the nodules, as well as central neovascularity. On enchanced computed tomography images, the lesions showed peripheral enhancement only. On magnetic resonance images, tumor signal was low on T1-weighted and moderately high on T2-weighted images. The distinction between normal liver and tumor was difficult on all sequences. Administration of superparamagnetic iron oxide particles delineated well the tumor by suppressing the signal of the normal liver and better depicted areas of remaining healthy parenchyma.
