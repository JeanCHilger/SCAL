Arterial pressure measurements using infrared photosensors: comparison with CW Doppler. We evaluated the accuracy of modern infrared photosensors (IPs) from a photoplethysmography (PPG) machine as flow detector in determining the systolic arterial pressures and ankle/brachial indices (ABIs) in comparison to the traditional continuous wave Doppler (Doppler) method. Pressures were obtained by placing an appropriate pneumatic cuff above the elbow and ankle. The Doppler probe was placed at brachial artery, posterior tibial artery and dorsalis pedis artery, and the IP was placed on the pad of the index finger and great toe. The two techniques were compared in 181 limbs in our non-invasive vascular laboratory, 133 limbs with normal and 48 limbs with abnormal ABIs. The accuracy of absolute ankle pressure measurements was also compared by both methods. We found that IPs from PPG machine have a good correlation (linear regression r=0.96 for normal and r=0.95 for abnormal ankle pressures) with the Doppler method. There was no significant difference (P< or =0.0001) in the ABIs calculated by two methods in either normal or abnormal subjects. The PPG method was easier, quicker and automated as compared with the cumbersome Doppler method. While PPG method does not differentiate between occlusive disease of posterior tibial and anterior tibial/dorsalis pedis arteries, it is better suited for non-compliant patients and is superior to Doppler method in advanced occlusive arterial disease. We recommend that it be used on a routine basis.
