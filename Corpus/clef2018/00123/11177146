Three-year outcome of endovascular treatment of superficial femoral artery occlusion. Patency after primary percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and stenting of superficial femoral artery (SFA) occlusions is better than historical experience with PTA alone.Consecutive case series of primary PTA with stenting, and follow-up with duplex imaging every 6 months (mean +/- SD follow-up, 32 +/- 15 months).Veterans Affairs medical center.Patients were 57 previously untreated men with 71 limbs having chronic atherosclerotic SFA occlusion with suprageniculate reconstitution and patent tibial runoff. Critical ischemia (Society for Vascular Surgery [SVS] category, 4-6) was present in 7 (10%), the remainder had intermittent claudication only (SVS, 1-3).Guidewire recanalization followed by PTA, Wallstent deployment, and adjunctive thrombolysis as necessary 19 limbs (27%) required thrombolysis to manage periprocedural thrombosis.Cumulative patency, limb salvage, and complications.Length (mean +/- SD) of occlusion was 14.4 +/- 9.9 cm. Length of stented artery was 24.3 +/- 11.1 cm. Ankle brachial index increased from 0.59 +/- 0.14 to 0.86 +/- 0.16 (P<.001) after stenting. One- and 3-year patencies were as follows: primary, 54.6% +/- 6.3% and 29.9% +/- 6.6% assisted primary, 72.3% +/- 5.6% and 59.0% +/- 6.8%Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting yielded higher patency rates than historical controls undergoing PTA alone. When periprocedural thrombolysis is required, subsequent patency appears to be significantly worse. Poor results after PTA and stenting of limbs with critical ischemia and the need for additional endovascular therapy limit the technique's utility.
