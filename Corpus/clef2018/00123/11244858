Use of US-contrast media in the diagnosis of carotid artery stenosis. With the advent of ultrasound diagnostic devices that provide a possibility of colored mapping, regimes of energy Doppler regimens, and procedures of second harmonic, conditions for using ultrasound contrast agents occurred. The drug Levovist was used during carotid Doppler study in 16 patients in whom primary vascular scanning was of poor quality. The use of Levovist improved the accuracy of diagnosing the degree of arterial stenosis from 40 to 95%. Thus, the use of ultrasound contrast agents in Doppler ultrasound of carotids makes it possible to specify the degree of stenosis, to differentiate arterial subocclusion and occlusion, to visualize minor vessels with low blood velocity.
