Therapeutic effects of Vascupump treatment patients with Fontaine Stage II B arteriopathy. Intermittent claudication is the primary symptom of chronic obstructive arteriopathies of the lower extremities. Increased walking distance is the aim of all physical or pharmacological treatment of such patients. The study reported aims to assess the increase in distal arterial blood flow in arteriopathic patients achieved by physical treatment using a cuff, generally positioned on the upper third of the thigh to produce pulsed compressions. By tightening for a few milliseconds slightly behind the natural cardiac systole, the cuff reinforces the systolic thrust to increase distal perfusion without making any additional demand, on the cardiac pump. The cuff used is produced by Vascupump Copyright vp-El. The trial was conducted on 36 patients with intermittent claudication divided into 3 groups. Group A included 12 patients given Vascupump Copyright treatment only (20 yen 45 minute sessions) Group B included 12 patients given combined treatment with the Vascupump Copyright and endovenous Pentoxillin (3 fl/per diem for 20 days)
