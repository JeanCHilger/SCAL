Angioplasty for the treatment of buttock claudication caused by internal iliac artery stenoses. A case of buttock claudication due to isolated internal iliac artery stenoses is presented. Although ankle systolic pressure at rest was within normal limits and distal pulses were palpable, an angiogram demonstrated severe stenoses. A computed tomography scan showed no spinal stenosis. The patient was successfully treated with angioplasty. This diagnosis may be elusive if ankle pressure or distal pulses are normal, thereby directing the clinician's suspicion away from vascular pathology.
