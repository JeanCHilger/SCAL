Use of intraoperative Doppler ultrasound to diagnose hepatic venous obstruction in a right lobe living donor liver transplant. Right lobe liver transplantation is a relatively new and technically challenging method of living donor transplantation. Integrity of the hepatic venous anastomosis is crucial for successful transplantation. We describe the use of intraoperative Doppler sonography to diagnose stenosis of the hepatic vein anastomosis, with associated compromise of venous drainage and graft perfusion.
