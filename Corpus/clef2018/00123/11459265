Results of infrainguinal bypass surgery: an analysis of 263 consecutive operations. The purpose of this clinical study was to assess the success of infrainguinal revascularization in the treatment of lower limb ischaemia.226 consecutive patients underwent 263 femoropopliteal (n = 194) or femorodistal (n = 69) bypass operations during 1988-1996 at a university hospital. Records of all patients were reviewed. Late control visits including clinical and colour doppler ultrasound examinations were programmed for 109 patients. Initial success, primary and secondary patencies, limb salvage and survival rates were determined and factors affecting outcome were analysed in various patient categories.Initial success rate was 92% (243/263). The primary and secondary patencies were 70/83% and 52/63% at one and five years, respectively. The corresponding limb salvage rates for patients with chronic critical ischaemia were 82% and 77%. The number of diseased vessels in the treated limb correlated negatively with the primary patency. Advanced age did not affect primary patency or limb salvage rates. Diabetes and the use of distal revascularizations were independent predictors of poorer limb salvage. Diabetes and renal insufficiency proved to shorten life expectancy.Infrainguinal revascularizations are effective regardless of patient's age. The extent of atherosclerotic changes in the operated limb, diabetes and renal insufficiency are factors affecting outcome.
