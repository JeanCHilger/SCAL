Hand-arm vibration syndrome from exposure to high-pressure hoses. Hand-arm vibration syndrome has been reported in the literature to occur following exposure to vibration from the use of many tools, but to date there have been no case reports of its occurrence in workers who have used high-pressure hoses, alone or with other tools. To remedy this, the case histories of nine subjects (two without mixed exposure) examined in the UK and Canada are presented, together with their severity classified according to the Stockholm scales. Attention is drawn to the need to use multiple diagnostic tests to establish the diagnosis and the need to implement vibration isolation and damping methodologies, as and when feasible, with respect to hose nozzles in order to minimize the hazard. The ultimate goal for tool manufacturers, hygienists and engineers should be to reduce workplace vibration levels to meet national and international guidelines and legislation, including UK Health & Safety Executive guidelines and European Economic Community directives. The respective risk levels are presented, together with vibration measurements on hoses used by some of the cases.
