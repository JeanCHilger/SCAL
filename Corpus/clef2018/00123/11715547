Clinical analysis of Doppler waveform in arterial occlusive disease in the lower limbs. In order increase the diagnostic standard of Doppler ultrasound to arterial occlusive disease in the lower limbs.120 normal lower limbs and 66 lower limbs with arterial occlusive disease were measured by directional Doppler blood velocity detector in different segments. The peak forward velocity(PFV), peak reverse velocity(PRV), acceleration time(AT), and deceleration time(DT) were determined and compared.The blood flow velocity of the lower limb arteries was gradually slowed down from the proximal to the distal in the normal group. The ratio of distal to proximal PFA, PRV, AT and DT was less than 1.0. PFV and PRV in the disease group were slower than in the normal group(P < 0.01). AT and DT in the disease group were longer than in the normal group(P < 0.01). It was discovered that the ratio of distal to proximal DT was greater than 1.0 in arterial stenosis(> 50%) or occlusion (collateral artery development).The results were compared those of arteriography. The diagnostic coincidence ratio of Doppler ultrasound for localization was 91%(60/66).
