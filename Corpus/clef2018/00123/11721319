Mechanical vs intrinsic components in the improvement of brachial arterial compliance. Comparison of the effects of atenolol versus ramipril in hypertensive patients. The aim of this study was to compare the mechanical and intrinsic effects of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, vs a beta-blocker, on brachial arterial compliance. In a double blind study, 34 essential hypertensive patients were treated for 3 months with either ramipril 2.5-5.0 mg daily (n = 17, age 57 +/- 7 y, 11 males) or atenolol 50-100 mg daily (n = 17, age 53 +/- 8 y, 11 males). Blood pressure (BP), brachial artery diameter (D), brachial-radial pulse wave velocity (PWV) and effective compliance (Ceff), were measured before and at the end of the study. Isobaric evaluation (Ciso) was performed in the entire population studied at an average mean BP of 110 mmHg. Ramipril significantly reduced BP from 155 +/- 16/94 +/- 6 mmHg to 140 +/- 15/85 +/- 7 mmHg (p < 0.001) without affecting heart rate (HR 74 +/- 10 vs. 75 +/- 12 bpm). In addition, it significantly improved both PWV (18%
