Arterielle occlusion in two leg amputees ("phantom claudication" due to pelvic-artery stenosis) (author's transl). Signs of intermittent claudication in the phantom leg developed in two patients 18 and 27 years, respectively, after mid-thigh amputation. Symptomatic treatment of the phantom pain was without success. Clinical, oscillographic and angiographic studies demonstrated atherosclerotic arterial stenoses of the iliac arteries. After successful vascular reconstruction (iliac-femoral and aortic-femoral bypass, respectively) on the side of amputation both patients are without pain or other symptoms and can again walk with restriction.
