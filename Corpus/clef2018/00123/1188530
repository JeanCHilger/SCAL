Evaluation of aorto-iliac disease with Doppler ultrasound and isotope clearance techniques. The clearance of 99mTc from the hamstring muscle compartment of patients with aorto-iliac or iliac disease was examined with the patients at rest and after exercise. The values were compared with those obtained in a group of controls and another group with superficial femoral, or femoropopliteal arterial occlusion. A statistically significant difference in the rate of 99mTc clearance was found in patients with proximal vascular disease.
