Renal artery stenting in patients with a solitary functioning kidney. To retrospectively evaluate the results of renal artery stenting in patients with renovascular disease and a solitary functioning kidney.Palmaz stents were placed in 16 patients with a solitary functioning kidney, renal artery stenosis, hypertension and renal failure. Stenoses were evaluated with color Doppler ultrasound, MR angiography and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Indications for stenting were: recoil after percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) (63%), arterial dissection after PTRA (13%) and primary stenting (25%). Immediate results were evaluated by DSA. On follow-up (6-36 months), patients underwent periodical evaluation of clinical conditions (blood pressure and serum creatinine level) and stent patency, by means of color Doppler ultrasound.Stent placement was successful in all patients (100%). Cumulative primary patency rate was: 100% at 1 day, 93.75% at 6 months, 81.25% at 12 months and 75% at 24 months. A significant reduction in diastolic blood pressure occurred (mean +/- SD 104 +/- 6 vs 92 +/- 3 p < 0.05)Renal artery stenting, both after PTRA and as primary stenting, represents a safe procedure, able to preserve renal function in patients with a solitary functioning kidney.
