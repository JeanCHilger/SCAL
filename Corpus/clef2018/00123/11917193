The prevalence of impaired left ventricular diastolic filling is related to the extent of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with stable coronary artery disease. The relation between abnormal left ventricular (LV) diastolic filling and the extent of coronary atherosclerosis per se has not been described. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of impaired LV diastolic filling in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) and its relationship to the number and location of coronary lesions visualized at coronary angiography.In 170 consecutive patients with stable CAD and an abnormal coronary angiogram we assessed LV diastolic filling by Doppler evaluation of the transmitral early to atrial peak flow velocity (E/A) and the systolic to diastolic ratio of the pulmonary venous peak inflow to the left atrium (S/D). Abnormal diastolic filling was defined as E/A < or =0.75, or E/A >1.0 combined with S/D < or =1.0, and was present in 41% of the patients. In patients with one-, two- and three-vessel disease the prevalence of impaired diastolic filling was 27, 30 and 49%, respectively (P = 0.026). In multiple logistic regression analysis diastolic filling was independently correlated with the number of stenotic coronary vessel areas.In patients with stable angiographically verified CAD, the prevalence of impaired diastolic filling was 41%. The prevalence increased with an increasing number of stenotic coronary artery areas independent of other variables tested, including prior myocardial infarction, LV systolic function and mitral regurgitation.
