The effect of hepatic inflow occlusion on laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation using simulated tumors. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of hepatic inflow occlusion (the Pringle maneuver) on laparoscopic radiofrequency (RF) ablation.Using a previously validated agarose tissue-mimic model, 1-cm simulated hepatic tumors (three per animal) were laparoscopically ablated in five pigs with normal perfusion and then in five pigs with hepatic artery and portal vein occlusion. Energy was applied until tissue temperature reached 100 degrees C (warm-up) and thereafter for eight min. Specimens were examined immediately after treatment.Vascular occlusion was successful in all cases per color-flow Doppler ultrasound. Pringle time was 11.4 +/- 1.6 min. Warm-up time (2.7 +/- 1.4 vs 20.2 +/- 14.0 min) was significantly faster in the Pringle group. Ablation diameter (34.8 +/- 2.9 vs 24.7 +/- 3.1 mm), proportion of round/ovoid lesions (93% vs 20%), ablation symmetry (100% vs 40%), and margin distance (5.1 +/- 3.0 vs 1.1 +/- 1.2 mm) were significantly better for the Pringle group than the No Pringle group, respectively.Using a Pringle maneuver during laparoscopic RF ablation significantly enhances ablation geometry and results in larger margins.
