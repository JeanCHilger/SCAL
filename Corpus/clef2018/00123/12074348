Greater intima-media thickness in the carotid bulb is associated with reduced baroreflex sensitivity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between resting baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), a putative marker of subclinical atherosclerosis. Participants were 64 men and 18 women (median age, 57 years range, 40 to 70 years), who did not have a previous history of coronary artery disease or treatment for hypertension. Resting BRS was measured during a 9-min baseline period using the noninvasive sequence technique
