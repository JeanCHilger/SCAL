In situ confirmation of retinal blood flow improvement after carotid endarterectomy in a patient with ocular ischemic syndrome. To report a patient with ocular ischemic syndrome due to an internal carotid artery stenosis in whom we confirmed improved retinal blood flow noninvasively after carotid endarterectomy.Observational case report.Retinal flowmetry.In a 72-year-old hypertensive man with a transient ischemic attack including dysgraphia, carotid angiography revealed approximately 90% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery. Standard carotid endarterectomy was performed. Postoperatively, good patency of the left internal carotid artery was confirmed by magnetic resonance angiography. We measured tissue blood flow in the fundus of each eye using a Heidelberg retina flowmeter before and after endarterectomy. Preoperative measurements showed reduction of blood flow in the left fundus, while values 3 months after surgery indicated a significant improvement of blood flow (P <.05, one-factor analysis of variance [ANOVA]).Retinal flowmetry can noninvasively detect differences in retinal blood flow between eyes in a patient with unilateral internal carotid artery stenosis and also assess the improvement of retinal blood flow after carotid endarterectomy.
