Proceedings: The ankle arterial pressure during reactive hyperemia in healthy patients and patients with arterial occlusive disease. In 8 healthy subjects and in 16 patients with arterial occlusions in the iliac or ilio-femoral region ankle blood pressure and blood flow velocity were measured by Doppler ultrasound during postocclusive reactive hyperemia. In the normal subjects the ankle blood pressure decreased significantly within the initial 30 sec after release of the occlusion. The pressure values showed a negative relation to the simultaneous increases in flow velocity (r = 0.67). In the patients the pressure decreased further and the reduction was prolonged with the protracted course of the reactive hyperemia.
