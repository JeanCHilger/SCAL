Classification, epidemiology, risk factors, and natural history of peripheral arterial disease. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a clinical condition that has often been neglected. The clinical diagnosis of PAD may be made on the basis of an accurate history by using the WHO/Rose Questionnaire or the Edinburgh Questionnaire. From a clinical point of view, PAD may be classified into four stages. The PARTNERS Programme (PAD Awareness, Risk and Treatment: NEw Resources for Survival) is a recent study based on a partnership to improve PAD care. In this population, the prevalence of patients who were PAD+/CVD- was approximately 12% in males and 15% in females PAD+/CVD+ approximately 18% in males and 14% in females
