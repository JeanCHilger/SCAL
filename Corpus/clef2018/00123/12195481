Spontaneous resolution of a portal vein stenosis over a 21-month period in a "split-liver" transplant: demonstration by colour Doppler ultrasound, catheter angiography and splenic pulp pressures. Portal vein stenosis in a "split-liver" transplant patient is demonstrated on colour Doppler ultrasound and indirect portography with raised splenic pulp pressures which resolves over a 21-month period without surgical or radiological intervention. When a portal vein stenosis in a liver transplant is encountered without severe derangement of liver function tests or signs of portal hypertension, regular follow-up colour Doppler ultrasound surveillance allows for evidence of spontaneous resolution.
