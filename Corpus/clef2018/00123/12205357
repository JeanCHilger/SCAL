Cutting and stenting in a heavily calcified left anterior descending artery lesion. The significance of heavily calcified proximal left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis in a 57-year-old man was assessed physiologically using a Doppler flow wire. Intravascular ultrasound guidance allowed for adequate dilatation with a cutting balloon and optimization of stent deployment. The cutting balloon offers an effective alternative in this challenging scenario.
