Hepatic artery stenosis following liver transplantation: significance of the tardus parvus waveform and the role of microbubble contrast media in the detection of a focal stenosis. To evaluate the role of microbubble ultrasound contrast media in detecting stenosis of the post-liver transplant extrahepatic hepatic artery (HA) in the presence of the tardus parvus spectral Doppler waveform of the intrahepatic HA.All post-liver transplant patients with a prolonged systolic acceleration time (SAT>0.08s) and/or a reduced resistant index (RI<0.50) of the HA (the tardus parvus waveform) on colour Doppler ultrasound (CDUS), were assessed with microbubble contrast medium for a focal arterial stenosis. Following microbubble contrast-enhanced CDUS, patients underwent arteriography or follow-up CDUS.A total of 2038 examinations were performed in 529 liver transplant recipients 16 (3.02%) tardus parvus waveforms were identified. The median SAT of the intrahepatic HA was 0.18s (range 0.11-0.38s) and the RI 0.47 (range 0.22-0.58). No extrahepatic elevated peak systolic velocity (PSV), defined as above 1.00m/s, was detected on the baseline examinations. Following the administration of microbubble contrast, medium, PSV in the extrahepatic HA was elevated in 14 of 16 patients, (median=2.15m/s, range=1.44-3.10m/s)The tardus parvus waveform pattern is an excellent screening test for the presence of post-liver transplantation hepatic artery stenosis. There is only a limited role for microbubble ultrasound contrast agent in the presence of a tardus parvus waveform. It could be used following equivocal colour Doppler ultrasound, but arteriography will still be necessary.
