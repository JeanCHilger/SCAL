Peripheral artery disease in type 2 diabetes: the role of fibrinolysis. The aim of the present study is to verify the relationship between peripheral artery disease (PAD) and some coagulation/fibrinolysis parameters in type 2 diabetic patients. Sixty-three type 2 diabetic patients, without PAD, were studied at baseline and after 4 years. Assessments included tissue-Plasminogen Activator (t-PA), Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 antigen (PAI-1 Ag), Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 activity (PAI-1 Act), Plasminogen (Pl), Fibrin peptide A (FPA), Fibrinogen (Fr), and the ankle/brachial pressure index (ABI). We observed a significant difference between diabetic patients and controls as regards tPA (11.8 +/- 5.4 vs. 6.6 +/- 3.0 ng/ml p <0.05) and PAI-1 Act (17.8 +/- 9.2 vs. 11.7 +/- 6.6 ng/dl
