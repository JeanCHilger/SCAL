Practical office technics for physiologic vascular testing. The development of the Doppler ultrasonic flow velocity detector has improved diagnostic accuracy in peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Survey of the peripheral vessels with the Doppler ultrasonic flow velocity detector, measurement of systolic arterial blood pressure at the ankle and arm, and exercise testing are three easily done tests which may be readily carried out in the doctor's office and which provide useful information. Noninvasive vascular testing should be in the armamentarium of all primary care physicians.
