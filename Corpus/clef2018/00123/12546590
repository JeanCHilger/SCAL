Duplex ultrasound-guided femoropopliteal angioplasty: initial and 12-month results from a case controlled study. To evaluate initial technical success, procedural complications, and 12-month patency of duplex-guided angioplasty compared to conventional fluoroscopically-guided procedures.One hundred four patients (65 men mean age 69 years) who underwent duplex-guided femoropopliteal angioplasty were compared to 104 patients undergoing fluoroscopically-guide procedures who were matched for age, sex, baseline ankle-brachial index (ABI), and length and grade of lesion. Patients were followed for 12 months, and restenosis was assessed by ABI and duplex sonography.Technical success was achieved in 88 (84.6%) patients from the duplex-guided group and in 102 (98.1%) control patients (p=0.001). Periprocedural complications occurred in 12.5% (n=13) and 18.3% (n=19), respectively (p=0.4). Contrast-induced transient renal impairment was observed in 7 (6.7%) patients in the fluoroscopic group. One hundred (96.1%) patients in the duplex and 102 (98.1%) patients in the fluoroscopic group completed the 12-month follow-up. Restenosis was found in 35 (39.8%) patients of the duplex group and in 38 (37.2%) patients of the fluoroscopic group (p=0.8).Technical success of duplex-guided procedures was significantly lower compared to fluoroscopic angioplasty complications and 12-month patency were similar with both techniques. Duplex-guided angioplasty may be a feasible alternative, particularly for patients at high risk for contrast-induced complications.
