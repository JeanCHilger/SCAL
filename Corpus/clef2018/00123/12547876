Pulse wave velocity as an indicator of atherosclerosis in impaired fasting glucose: the Tanno and Sobetsu study. Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), as an indicator of atherosclerosis in impaired fasting glucose (IFG), was studied in 232 subjects randomly selected from inhabitants of two rural communities in Japan.BMI, systolic blood pressure (SBP), fasting blood glucose (FBS), lipid parameters, ankle brachial pressure index (ABI), and baPWV were measured in each subject. ABI and baPWV were measured using the recently developed device, form ABI/PWV. The subjects were divided into three groups according FBS level: a normal group consisting of subjects with FBS <110 mg/dl, an IFG group consisting of subjects with FBS 110-125 mg/dl, and a diabetic group consisting of subjects with FBS > or =126 mg/dl and subjects taking hypoglycemic agents. The parameters in the three groups were compared. RESULTS-It was found that the baPWV value increased with increasing plasma glucose level. Significant differences were found between the baPWV values in the normal and IFG groups (1,518 vs. 1,673 cm/s, P = 0.01) and in the normal and diabetic groups (1,518 vs. 1,771 cm/s, P < 0.0001). The results of multiple regression analysis showed that FBS was closely related to baPWV as well as to age and SBP.The relationship between IFG and atherosclerosis remains controversial. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether strict control of blood glucose level in patients with IFG will result in the prevention of atherosclerosis progression.
