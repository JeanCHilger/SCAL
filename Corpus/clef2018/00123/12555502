Epidemiology of and risk factors for lower limb arteriopathy obliterans. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is most frequently caused by atherosclerosis. The prevalence of intermittent claudication is about 3 to 6% of the men over 60 years. But recent epidemiological studies demonstrate that prevalence of asymptomatic forms is two to three fold higher--about 3.4 to 12.1%. The most relevant diagnostic criteria for asymptomatic PAD is probably the measure of the ankle/brachial index. Most important risk factors for PAD are smoking and diabetes mellitus. Improving symptoms or stabilization are a common fate (50%) in PAD. About 25% will experience revascularization procedures (angioplasty or surgery), 4% will have severe amputation and worsening symptoms occur in 15% of patients. Critical limb ischemia is mostly rare (1%). It is not surprising that fate of claudicant and mortality is determined by coronary events and cardiovascular diseases.
