Transplantation of autologous peripheral blood stem cells for the treatment of lower limb arteriosclerosis obliterans. To evaluate the clinical efficacy of mobilized autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) transplantation in a 48 years old patient with lower limb arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO).rhG-CSF 600 micro g/d for 5 days to mobilize stem cells. On the fifth day, PBSC were collected with a Version 4 blood-cells separator. Three hours late, the PBSC were intramuscularly injected into the ischemic areas of the two lower limbs (3 x 10(9) cells per limb). The clinical and laboratory findings were monitored every week for 3 months. Forty-four days after the implantation, left lower limb with severe ASO was given an additional implantation of the same number of cells as the first time.The peripheral blood CD(34)(+) cells were increased from 0.18% to 0.75% after 5 days of rhG-CSF mobilization. Three months after the first stem cell transplantation, severe pain lameness, local cool-feeling and ulcer were improved, and ABI increased from 0.49, 0.69 to 0.50, 0.85, the amplitude of blood flow and laser Doppler blood perfusion were also significantly improved (P < 0.01). At the same time, digital subtraction angiographic scores for new collateral vessel formation were showed as + 3(rich). No related complication or adverse effect were observed during the 3-month observation.Transplantation of mobilized autologous PBSC might be a simple, safe, and effective method for the treatment of ASO.
