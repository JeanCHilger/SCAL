Renal artery aneurysm: the significance of abdominal bruit and use of color Doppler. A case of renal artery aneurysm is presented. The patient had no hypertension and no signs of arteriosclerosis obliterans or aortitis syndrome, except for abdominal bruit. A saccular aneurysm, 1 cm in diameter, was demonstrated by two-dimensional and color Doppler ultrasound and documented by angiography. The aneurysm was embolized by a steel coil. The abdominal bruit, though uncommon, is a very important bed-side sign of renal artery aneurysm, if the patient exhibits no arteriosclerosis obliterans or aortitis syndrome. Ultrasound Doppler is very useful in screening for aneurysm.
