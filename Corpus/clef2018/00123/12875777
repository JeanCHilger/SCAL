Rescue of hypercholesterolemia-related impairment of angiogenesis by oral folate supplementation. We examined whether oral folate supplementation would rescue a hypercholesterolemia (HC)-related impairment of ischemia-induced angiogenesis.Folate protects against endothelial dysfunction, but the effect of folate supplementation on angiogenesis is little known.Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups. Control rats were fed a normal diet (n = 18) HC rats (n = 18) were fed 2% cholesterol dietLaser Doppler blood flow (LDBF) analysis showed lower ischemic/normal LDBF ratio in the HC group than in the control group. Angiographic and histologic analyses on day 14 revealed a smaller angiographic score (p < 0.001) and capillary density (p < 0.001) in the HC group than in controls, which were associated with reduced tissue NOx and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels. The LDBF ratio, angiographic score, and capillary density were significantly restored in the HC+F group (p < 0.01 vs. HC), which were associated with increased serum folate and tissue NOx and cGMP levels. Finally, L-NAME treatment abolished the beneficial action of folate on angiogenesis in the HC state.Ischemia-induced angiogenesis was inhibited by HC, which was rescued by oral folate supplementation, at least in part, via an NO-dependent manner.
