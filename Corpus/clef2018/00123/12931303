Role of magnetic resonance angiography in vascular surgery. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is a method of non-invasive vascular imaging that has evolved and improved significantly since first described. In this article, the basic principles of MRA are reviewed and MRA compared with the more conventional imaging techniques of Doppler ultrasound and angiography. The ways in which MRA can be used in conjunction with more conventional vascular imaging techniques in investigation and management of carotid disease, aortic disease, and peripheral vascular disease are discussed in this article.
