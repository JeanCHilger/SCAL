Evaluation of the local effects of vitamin E (E-Mousse) on free radicals in diabetic microangiopathy: a randomized, controlled trial. The aims of the study were to evaluate the short-term effects of a new thermosensitive, vitamin E (V-E) mousse on local free radicals (FR) and skin flux in diabetic microangiopathy. A group of 40 patients with diabetic microangiopathy was included. The variation in measurements of skin FR was evaluated by the D-Rom test. Subjects were between 45 and 65 years with type II diabetes and good metabolic control. E-mousse, a thermoactive preparation of acetate vitamin E (20%), was applied twice daily on the whole surface of the leg (below knee) and foot for 3 weeks. The contralateral leg was untreated acting as control. Subjects with age between 45 and 65 years with type II diabetes (diagnosed at least 5 years before) and good metabolic control (blood sugar < 180 mg/dL) were included after informed consent. Patients with uncontrolled diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and severe lower limbs infections were excluded. Local free radicals (FR) and laser Doppler flux including the venoarteriolar response (VAR) were evaluated. The tolerability was evaluated by a semiquantitative score. Of the 40 included patients 34 completed the study. The 2 groups were comparable. At 3 weeks there was no decrease in FR in controls the decrease in the treatment group was 45.3% (p < 0.05). Also in the treatment group RF decreased (p < 0.05) and the VARveno improved from an average of 21% to an average of 38% (p < 0.05). No significant variations were observed in the control group. The variation in symptomatic score was from a total value of 8 to 5 in the control group and from 8 to 1 in the treatment group (p < 0.02). Their tolerability was good. In conclusion local treatment with E-mousse for 3 weeks in diabetic microangiopathy improves skin microcirculation and the metabolic condition as shown by the decrease in FR.
