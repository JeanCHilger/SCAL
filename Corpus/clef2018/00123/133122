Pulsed Doppler ultrasound detection of flow disturbances in arteriosclerosis. Pulsed Doppler ultrasound blood flow detection has been used in a noninvasive manner to detect arterial abnormalities associated with arteriosclerosis. Sound spectrograms of ultrasound signals obtained from in vitro and animal studies in which flow was disturbed by obstacles placed in the flow stream showed a different distribution of energy over frequency than signals obtained from studies with no flow disturbances. Similar findings were seen clinically. A technique has been developed which can detect disturbed flow patterns resulting from partial occlusion in important superficial arteries (e.g. femoral and carotid) up to 15 cm distal to localized arterial wall abnormalities. Thirty-five arterial examinations of normal and arteriographically abnormal arteries in 12 patients revealed a sensitivity of 83 percent and a specificity of 61 percent. This study suggests that pulsed Doppler ultrasound may be useful as a screening technique for detection of arteriosclerotic lesions in major superficial arteries.
