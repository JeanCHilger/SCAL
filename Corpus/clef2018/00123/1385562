Two-year follow-up after laser thermal balloon angioplasty (LTBA) in lower extremities: initial experience. We describe the results obtained with the use of laser thermal balloon angioplasty (LTBA) in the treatment of atherosclerosis obliterans of the lower limbs in 37 patients (34 males, 3 females, mean age 58 +/- 9 years) with occlusive arterial disease (Fontaine stages II-IV) presenting 39 significant lesions. Immediate results and two years of clinical follow-up are analyzed. Initial ankle/brachial Doppler index was 0.51 +/- 0.17. Eighteen lesions were located in the iliac area (13 stenoses 2.3 +/- 1 cm and 5 occlusions 4.2 +/- 3 cm) and 21 lesions in the femoropopliteal area (5 stenoses 2.6 +/- 2 cm and 16 occlusions 5.7 +/- 3 cm). A percutaneous procedure was used in 38 cases. In only one case was femoral dissection needed. The laser source was argon in 26 cases and Nd-YAG in 13. Initial success was 85% (89% in iliac lesions and 81% in femoropopliteal lesions 100% in stenoses and 70% in occlusions). The presence of occlusion (p less than 0.01) and/or calcium (p less than 0.05) negatively influenced the immediate results. No major complications were observed
