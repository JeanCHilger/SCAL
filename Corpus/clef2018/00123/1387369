Isradipine in the treatment of peripheral occlusive vascular disease of the lower limbs: a pilot study. The long-term effects of isradipine on peripheral occlusive vascular disease of the lower limbs were investigated in 23 normotensive patients with stable Fontaine stage IIa disease and with an absolute pain-free interval (treadmill speed 4 km/h, no incline) of 300 - 700 m, and Doppler ankle - arm arterial pressure index of less than 0.80 in at least one leg. Using a double-blind, parallel-group design, patients received either 2.5 mg isradipine twice daily or placebo for 12 months. Both isradipine (n = 11) and placebo (n = 12) increased the absolute pain-free interval mean values the increases were not significantly different. Similar trends were observed in the mean values for relative pain-free interval and ankle--arm arterial pressure index. In a subgroup of patients with a baseline absolute pain-free interval of greater than 500 m, isradipine (n = 6) significantly (P less than 0.001) increased both the absolute and the relative pain-free intervals and increased the ankle--arm arterial pressure index compared with placebo (n = 7). The favourable effects of long-term isradipine treatment suggest that isradipine could positively interfere with factors involved in the progression of atherosclerotic lesions or improve collateral vessel flow.
