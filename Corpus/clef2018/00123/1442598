Use of intracoronary ultrasonography in assessing pharmacotherapy for myocardial ischemia. Intracoronary ultrasonography can provide morphologic and physiologic information on coronary vasomotor responses to pharmacotherapy. Preliminary studies indicate a high correlation between dimensions determined by 2-dimensional echocardiography, angiography, and pathology. Similarly, the emerging data on intracoronary Doppler flow velocity responses beyond atherosclerotic obstructions before, during, and after coronary balloon occlusion will provide further insights into myocardial oxygen supply and its responses to pharmacotherapy during controlled myocardial ischemia.
