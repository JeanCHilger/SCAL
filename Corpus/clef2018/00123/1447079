Theoretical analysis of occlusion techniques for measuring pulmonary capillary pressure. We have developed a model including three serial compliant compartments (arterial, capillary, and venous) separated by two resistances (arterial and venous) for interpreting in vivo single pulmonary arterial or venous occlusion pressure profiles and double occlusion. We formalized and solved the corresponding system of equations. We showed that in this model 1) pulmonary capillary pressure (Pc) profile after arterial or venous occlusion has an S shape, 2) the estimation of Pc by zero time extrapolation of the slow component of the arterial occlusion profile (Pcao) always overestimates Pc, 3) symmetrically such an estimation on the venous occlusion profile (Pcvo) always underestimates Pc, 4) double occlusion pressure (Pcdo) differs from Pc. We evaluated the impact of varying parameter values in the model with parameter sets drawn either from the literature or from arbitrary arterial and venous pressures, being respectively 20 and 5 mmHg. Resulting Pcao-Pc differences ranged from 0.4 to 5.4 mmHg and resulting Pcvo-Pc differences ranged from -0.3 to -5.0 mmHg. Pcdo-Pc was positive or negative, its absolute value in general being negligible (< 1.1 mmHg).
