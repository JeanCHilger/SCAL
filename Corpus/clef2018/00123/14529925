Vascular complications after liver transplantation. Vascular complications following liver transplantation is reviewed based upon literature data and our own results. Our study conclusions are mostly based on literature data, because our center does not have the liver transplantation experience of other centers worldwide. Thus, we may conclude, that the number and character of complications does not differ from those reported by other centers. The enbloc technique used in liver harvesting minimizes the risk of arterial damage in case of vascular anomalies. Recipient retransplantation is the most effective treatment method in cases of hepatic arterial occlusion. Doppler ultrasound examinations are effective to monitor vascular blood flow in the transplanted liver.
