Tetralogy of Fallot with anomalous origin of left pulmonary artery. Between 1971 and 1990, 7 patients of tetralogy of Fallot with anomalous origin of left pulmonary artery underwent intracardiac repairs at Tohoku University Hospital. They were 2 males and 5 females with ages ranging from 4 to 26 years old. The right pulmonary artery connected to right ventricle in all cases, whereas no communications between right ventricle and the left pulmonary artery were found. The left pulmonary artery directly originated from the ascending aorta in 2 patients (group I) and connected to the ductus arteriosus in 5 patients (group II and III). In 2 patients (group II), the left pulmonary artery was separated from the pulmonary arterial trunk by the intraluminal membrane, receiving blood supply through the ductus. In the remaining 3 patients (group III), there were no continuations between both pulmonary arteries. At the correction, communication between the left pulmonary artery and the pulmonary arterial trunk could be reconstructed in groups I and II. However, it was not possible in group III, because the ductus arteriosus and the left pulmonary artery had already been occluded before the intracardiac repair. In group III, ventricular septal defect was closed using a one-way valved patch or a perforated patch to decrease supersystemic right ventricular pressure. Postoperative right ventricular aortic pressure ratio was between 0.5 and 0.8 in groups I and II, and between 0.8 and 1.0 in group III. Three patients (one in each group) died after the operation. Severe pulmonary vascular obstructive disease was found in the left lung of group I.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
