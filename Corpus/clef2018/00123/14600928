Scintigraphic and ultrasonographic assessment of the effect of lumbar sympathectomy upon chronic arteriosclerotic ischaemia of lower extremities. The aim of the study was an evaluation of the effect of onesided lumbar sympathectomy in patients with peripheral vascular disease of lower extremity(ies), using perfusion scintigraphy with (99)mTc-MIBI and ultrasound Doppler blood flow-rate measurements. A secondary aim was a comparison of the diagnostic efficacy of the two techniques applied. The study was performed on 30 patients, studied prior to and early after one-sided lumbar sympathectomy. The scintigraphy yielded results indicating a statistically significant increase in perfusion of femoral and calf muscles (p < 0.001). Ultrasound investigation demonstrated significant (p < 0.001) increase of the maximal blood flow rate in the popliteal artery. Scintigraphic perfusion study yielded better agreement with the clinical evaluation than the ultrasound Doppler technique (83 v. 47 per cent, p < 0.01) and higher sensitivity in demonstration of improved blood supply (88 v. 36 per cent, p < 0.001).
