Effect of carotid artery stenting on the external carotid artery. We studied the fate of the ipsilateral external carotid artery (ECA) after stenting of the internal carotid artery (ICA) compared with the contralateral ECA.One hundred twenty-one ipsilateral ECAs in 112 consecutive patients who underwent carotid artery Wallstent placement were prospectively studied with color-coded duplex sonographic scanning (CCDS) and compared with 83 contralateral ECAs over 2 years. CCDS was scheduled for the day before (day 0), the day after (day 1) and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after stenting. Development of ECA occlusive disease was evaluated with ECA-common carotid artery flow ratio (peak systolic velocity). For estimation of ECA stenosis 70% or greater, flow ratio 4.1 was used as the cutoff point.Before and after stenting, two and three (one additional) ECA occlusions were seen. Median grade of ECA stenosis on day 1 did not significantly change at angiography (P = 1.0 tendency of increase) or CCDS (P =.27The more pronounced progression of arteriosclerotic disease at the orifice of the ipsilateral ECAs during the first year after carotid stenting might be due to local factors of the ICA stent. Its clinical significance in respect to the effect of the ECA as collateral supply to the brain might depend on the incidence of carotid stent rerecurrent stenosis, which was low in the present study.
