Effects of 18 days of bed rest on leg and arm venous properties. Venous function may be altered by bed rest deconditioning. Yet the contribution of altered venous compliance to the orthostatic intolerance observed after bed rest is uncertain. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of 18 days of bed rest on leg and arm (respectively large and small change in gravitational gradients and use patterns) venous properties. We hypothesized that the magnitude of these venous changes would be related to orthostatic intolerance. Eleven healthy subjects (10 men, 1 woman) participated in the study. Before (pre) and after (post) 18 days of 6 degrees head-down tilt bed rest, strain gauge venous occlusion plethysmography was used to assess limb venous vascular characteristics. Leg venous compliance was significantly decreased after bed rest (pre: 0.048 +/- 0.007 ml x 100 ml(-1) x mmHg(-1), post: 0.033 +/- 0.007 ml x 100 ml(-1) x mmHg(-1) P < 0.01), whereas arm compliance did not change. Leg venous flow resistance increased significantly after bed rest (pre: 1.73 +/- 1.08 mmHg x ml(-1) x 100 ml x min, post: 3.10 +/- 1.00 mmHg x ml(-1) x 100 ml x min
