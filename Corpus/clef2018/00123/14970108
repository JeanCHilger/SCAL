Relationship of high and low ankle brachial index to all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality: the Strong Heart Study. The associations of low (<0.90) and high (>1.40) ankle brachial index (ABI) with risk of all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality have not been examined in a population-based setting.We examined all-cause and CVD mortality in relation to low and high ABI in 4393 American Indians in the Strong Heart Study. Participants had bilateral ABI measurements at baseline and were followed up for 8.3+/-2.2 years (36 589 person-years). Cox regression was used to quantify mortality rates among participants with high and low ABI relative to those with normal ABI (0.90 < or =ABI < or =1.40). Death from all causes occurred in 1022 participants (23.3% 27.9 deaths per 1000 person-years), and of these, 272 (26.6%The association between high ABI and mortality was similar to that of low ABI and mortality, highlighting a U-shaped association between this noninvasive measure of peripheral arterial disease and mortality risk. Our data suggest that the upper limit of normal ABI should not exceed 1.40.
