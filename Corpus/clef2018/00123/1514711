Double-blind comparison of captopril with nifedipine in hypertension complicated by intermittent claudication. In a double-blind, crossover trial 12 patients with hypertension and peripheral arterial disease were randomized to three months' treatment with captopril 25-50 mg twice daily or nifedipine SR 20-40 mg twice daily. While both treatments were equally effective at lowering blood pressure, postexercise calf blood flow availability was greater during treatment with captopril (P less than 0.04). This was not reflected in walking capacity assessed by treadmill exercise. The results suggest that both captopril and nifedipine are appropriate antihypertensive agents in patients with peripheral arterial disease.
