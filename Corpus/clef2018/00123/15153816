The prevalence of asymptomatic arterial obstruction in the lower extremities among men and women 60 to 69 years of age. To estimate the prevalence of asymptomatic arterial obstruction in the lower extremities in men and women 60 to 69 years of age.A sample of 333 participants between 60 to 69 years of age attended a physical examination as part of a population based health study in Nord-Tr√∏ndelag County, Norway (the HUNT Study). The total prevalence of arterial obstruction was defined as the proportion of subjects with ankle brachial pressure index lower than 0.9 (ABPI<0.9). Further, the proportion of participants with arterial obstruction who also reported symptoms of intermittent claudication was defined as having symptomatic arterial obstruction. Finally, the prevalence of asymptomatic arterial obstruction was calculated as the difference between the total prevalence of arterial obstruction and the prevalence of symptomatic arterial obstruction.The total prevalence of arterial obstruction as defined by ABPI<0.9 was 7.8%. The prevalence was slightly higher among men (9.2%) than among women (6.9%), but the difference was not statistically significant (p-value=0.5). The prevalence of asymptomatic arterial obstruction was 6.3%, indicating that asymptomatic disease was approximately 4 times as frequent as symptomatic arterial obstruction (1.5%). The prevalence of asymptomatic arterial obstruction was nearly identical for men (6.2%) and women (6.4%).The total prevalence of arterial obstruction as defined by an ABPI<0.9 was 7.8% in this age group, and the prevalence of asymptomatic disease was 6.3%. Thus, only 1 in 5 persons who had objectively measured arterial obstruction indicated symptoms of intermittent claudication.
