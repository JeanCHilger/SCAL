Detection of microvascular impairment in type I diabetics by laser Doppler flowmetry. The use of a laser Doppler flowmeter to detect microcirculatory impairment and abnormalities in sympathetic neural control of blood flow in the hands and feet was evaluated. Measurements were carried out in 15 insulin dependent diabetic patients with retinopathy, 14 uncomplicated diabetics and 15 normal subjects. Three tests were assessed (1) the hyperaemic response of the skin microcirculation to local heating at 44 degrees C (2) the reactive hyperaemic response of the skin microcirculation to 2 min arterial occlusion
