Changes of regional hemodynamics and microcirculation in patients with obliterating atherosclerosis in stage of chronic critical ischemia of the lower extremities before and after of restorational operation performance. The state of regional hemodynamics and microcirculation in 47 patients with obliterating atherosclerosis of the lower extremities vessels in stage of chronic critical ischemia before and after performance of restorational operation was studied up. Ileo-femoral shunting using synthetic prosthesis was done in 9 patients and femoro-popliteal shunting--in 38. In 46 patients, in whom before the operation, basing on the Doppler flowmetry data, the preservation of the microcirculation bed functional reserves was noted, after the operation the increase of the regional blood flow and microcirculation indexes was observed beginning from the first up to the fifth day. In one patient the insufficient functional reserve of the microcirculation bed was revealed, the realization of restorational operation turned out to be ineffective, the lower extremity amputation was performed. The dynamics of the microcirculation changes on the first, third, fifth and seventh postoperative days was shown.
