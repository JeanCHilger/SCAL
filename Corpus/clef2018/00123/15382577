Renal pseudoaneurysm and arteriovenous fistula: color doppler study of a post-lithotripsy simple cyst. To describe the clinical and radiological (color doppler ultrasound, CT scan and arteriography) features of a case of renal arteriovenous malformation type mixed fistula with pseudoaneurysm in a female patient after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy.We report one case of secondary vascular malformation in a 54-year-old female patient who underwent extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy, presenting as recurrent hematuria. Ultrasound detected a "cystic" formation newly appeared after lithotripsy, being the diagnostic made by a color doppler study which showed a mixed high speed arteriovenous turbulent flow. The lesion showed intense intravenous contrast uptake on CT scan. Diagnosis was confirmed by arteriography.External shock wave lithotripsy is, as well as interventional procedures, a known cause of renal vascular complications, so that doppler color studies may be diagnostic in patients with suggestive clinical features, focusing specially on those lesions or morphological abnormalities newly appeared when compared to pre-treatment studies.
