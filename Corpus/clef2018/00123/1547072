Radiological intervention for the failing in situ vein bypass. With close surveillance, deteriorating hemodynamics may signal a failing in situ bypass that can be salvaged by timely intervention. The purpose of this report is to summarize our experience with in situ bypass salvage using interventional radiology. Twenty-nine patients underwent arteriography following bypass occlusion or when an ankle/brachial index reduction of greater than 0.15 was detected between two consecutive office visits. Eighteen percutaneous transluminal dilatations were performed one patient underwent repeat dilatation after 36 months, a second had four dilatations over 40 months. Ten significant arteriovenous fistulae were identified and were successfully embolized with 3 mm coils. One patient underwent excision of a retained valve. Six patients had initial fibrinolytic therapy for graft occlusion. The morbidity of these interventions was low
