White matter lesions and glial activation in a novel mouse model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. Cerebrovascular white matter (WM) lesions are closely associated with cognitive impairment and gait disorders in the elderly. We have successfully established a mouse model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion that may provide new strategies for the molecular analysis of cerebrovascular WM lesions.Adult C57Bl/6 male mice were subjected to bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) using external microcoils with varying inner diameters from 0.16 to 0.22 mm. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the frontal cortices was measured by laser-Doppler flowmetry at 2 hours and at 1, 3, 7, 14, and 30 days after BCAS. The brains were then removed and examined at 30 days with histological stains and immunohistochemistry for markers of microglia and astroglia.At 2 hours, the CBF values (ratio to the preoperative value) did not change in the 0.22 mm group but decreased significantly to 77.3+/-13.4% in the 0.20 mm group, 67.3+/-18.5% in the 0.18 mm group, and 51.4+/-11.5% in the 0.16 mm group. At day 1, the CBF began to recover in all groups but remained significantly lower until 14 days in comparison to the control group. In the 0.20 mm and 0.18 mm groups, WM lesions occurred after 14 days without any gray matter involvement. These lesions were the most intense in the corpus callosum adjacent to the lateral ventricle but were mild in the anterior commissure and optic tract. In contrast, 4 of 5 mice developed some gray matter changes in the 0.16 mm group. The proliferation of activated microglia and astroglia was observed in the WM beyond 3 days after BCAS.WM lesions were successfully induced after chronic cerebral hypoperfusion with relative preservation of the visual pathway. These features in this mouse model are appropriate for cognitive assessment and genetic analysis, and it may provide a powerful tool to understand the pathophysiology of WM lesions.
