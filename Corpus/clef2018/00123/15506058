Hand skin heating: a new method for the evaluation of conduit artery endothelial function in insulin-dependent diabetic patients. The presence of an altered endothelium-mediated flow-dependent dilatation (FDD) of peripheral conduit arteries in insulin-dependent diabetic patients without microangiopathy is still controversial. We studied 10 normotensive and non atherosclerotic insulin-dependent diabetic patients (D group) without complication (neuropathy, microalbuminuria or neuropathy) and 10 control subjects (C group) matched for age, sex and BMI. Radial artery diameter (RAD, echotracking) and flow (RAF, Doppler) were measured at baseline and during FDD in response to distal hand skin heating (from 34 to 44 degrees C). a method developed to increase RAF by stable steps by decreasing gradually hand skin vascular resistance. Endothelium-independent dilatation was evaluated by administration of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN: 0.3 mg spray). At baseline, there was no difference between group for RAF (C: 18 +/- 5 vs D: 18 +/- 2 mL/min NS) and RAD (C: 2.51 +/- 0.12 vs D: 2.54 +/- 0.07 mm
