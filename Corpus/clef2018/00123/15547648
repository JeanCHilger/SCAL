Classic intermittent claudication is an uncommon manifestation of lower extremity peripheral arterial disease in hospitalized patients with coronary artery disease. Synchronous peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and coronary artery disease (CAD) is common. Standardized questionnaires such as the Rose/WHO questionnaire and later the Edinburgh modification of this questionnaire were developed to screen for PAD. Little data are available on the sensitivity of these questionnaires in hospitalized patients with CAD. The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of these questionnaires and the prevalence of classic intermittent claudication in hospitalized patients with CAD. Medically stable patients with CAD were invited to participate before hospital discharge. The patients answered both the Rose/WHO and Edinburgh modification claudication questionnaires and had an ankle-brachial index (ABI) measured. An ABI less than or equal to 0.9 was considered to be indicative of significant PAD. Patients who had undergone previous lower extremity revascularization for PAD and had a corrected ABI greater than 0.9 were excluded. Ninety-five patients (66 men) were recruited. By measuring the ABI, 35 patients (25 men) were found to have significant PAD. An additional 3 patients who had an ABI corrected by lower extremity revascularization were excluded from the analysis. The Rose/WHO questionnaire had a sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy (95% CI) of 14.3% (2.7-25.9%), 96.7% (92.1-100%), and 66.3% (56.8-75.8%), respectively. The Edinburgh modification of the Rose/WHO questionnaire had a sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy (95% CI) of 28.6% (13.6-43.5%), 90.0% (82.4-97.6%), 67.4% (57.9-76.8%), respectively. Despite the high incidence of synchronous PAD in hospitalized patients with CAD, traditional claudication questionnaires are insensitive to PAD detection. Classic claudication is an uncommon manifestation of PAD in hospitalized patients with CAD.
