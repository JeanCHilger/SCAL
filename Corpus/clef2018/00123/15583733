Genetic variation in Fcgamma receptor IIa protects against advanced peripheral atherosclerosis. The Rotterdam Study. Immune processes play a substantial role in atherosclerotic disease. The role in atherosclerosis of Fcgamma receptor IIa (FcgammaRIIa), a receptor for immunoglobulin G and for the inflammatory mediator C-reactive protein, is not yet clear. Since the R/H131 polymorphism in the FcgammaRIIa gene strongly influences binding to FcgammaRIIa, we investigated the association of the R/H131 polymorphism with advanced peripheral atherosclerosis. Within the Rotterdam Study, a population-based cohort study, we determined FcgammaRIIa genotype in 430 subjects with advanced peripheral atherosclerosis as indicated by the ankle-arm index, and 411 controls. Heterozygous and homozygous carriers of the H131 allele were protected against advanced peripheral atherosclerosis (age- and gender-adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.77 (0.54-1.12) and 0.65 (0.44-0.98), respectively, P trend=0.04). This effect was most pronounced in subjects with modestly elevated levels of inflammation as indicated by the leukocyte count (OR 0.52 (0.29-0.93) and 0.45 (0.23-0.86), for heterozygotes and H131 homozygotes, respectively P trend=0.02). This is the first study showing that the H131 allele of FcgammaRIIa protects against advanced peripheral atherosclerosis.
