Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of infrapopliteal arteries in patients with intermittent claudication: acute and one-year results. In advanced stages of infrapopliteal peripheral arterial occlusive disease with critical ischemia of the lower limb, the efficacy of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is well established. In contrast, PTA is currently not the therapy of choice in intermittent claudication (IC). In this prospective study, patients with IC were treated percutaneously. Technical aspects and long-term results are presented. In 78 patients (61 males, or 78.2% age, 71 +/- 11 years) with IC (Rutherford grade 2 or 3), 104 interventions were performed. At baseline, the initial/absolute walking distance (IWD/AWD) was 49 +/- 34/102 +/- 88 m
