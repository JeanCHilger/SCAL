Ultrasound: a reproducible method to measure conduit vein compliance. Classical venous occlusion plethysmography (VOP) of the leg, often used to assess venous compliance, measures properties of the whole calf, including volume changes at the arterial side and the interstitial fluid accumulation that occurs as a result of the enhanced capillary pressure during venous occlusion. We present an ultrasound technique to measure the compliance of one major conduit vein in the leg. Ultrasound measurements of the popliteal vein were compared with classical VOP measurements, which were performed simultaneously in one subject. Six healthy individuals were measured on three occasions to assess short- and long-term reproducibility of the measurements. Six motor complete spinal cord-injured (SCI) individuals were included to compare venous compliance in subjects with known pathological changes of the venous system with controls. The ultrasound and VOP measurements of venous compliance correlated significantly (r(2) = 0.39, P = 0.001). Ultrasound provides reproducible measurements with short- and long-term coefficients of variation ranging from 10 to 15% for popliteal vein compliance and from 2 to 9% for absolute diameters at the different venous pressure steps. In addition, by using ultrasound, we were able to detect an 80% reduction in the compliance of the popliteal vein in SCI individuals compared with controls (P < 0.01). In conclusion, ultrasound is a suitable and reproducible method to measure conduit vein compliance and provides the possibility to specifically assess compliance of one vein instead of the whole calf.
