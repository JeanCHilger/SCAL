Short-term effects of growth hormone (GH) treatment or deprivation on cardiovascular risk parameters and intima-media thickness at carotid arteries in patients with severe GH deficiency. To explore early effects of GH treatment or deprivation on cardiovascular risk factors and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), we designed this randomized, cross-over study in 34 adult patients with severe GH deficiency. At study entry, the patients were randomized into two groups (A and B) group A (n = 17) received appropriate replacement therapy including GH at standard doses for 6 months and then were withdrawn from GH for the subsequent 6 months
