Percutaneous transluminal revascularization for iliac occlusive disease: long-term outcomes in TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus A and B lesions. Percutaneous transluminal intervention for atherosclerotic iliac occlusive disease is now commonplace. We examine the long-term outcomes of TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) A and B lesions. We performed a retrospective anonymous analysis of records from patients who underwent iliac artery angioplasty with or without stenting between January 1990 and June 1999. Indications for intervention were symptomatic claudication (77%) or critical ischemia (23%). Altogether, 276 patients (all men average age 64 +/- 11 years range 32-87 years) underwent 394 interventions. Co-morbidities included hypertension (61%), hypercholesterolemia (45%), diabetes (28%), and chronic renal insufficiency (26%). A total of the 62% of the lesions were TASC category A, and the remainder were category B. Of the 394 primary interventions, 51% included placement of stents. Technical success (defined by < 30% residual stenosis) was achieved in 98% of treated vessels. The procedure-related mortality rate was 1.8% at 30 days and 4.7% at 90 days
