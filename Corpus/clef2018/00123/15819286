Lipid-lowering therapy in patients with peripheral arterial disease: are guidelines being met? To determine the proportion of patients with lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD) who reach recommended low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels (<100 mg/dL) and to identify the patient characteristics that are independently associated with attaining the LDL-C goal (<100 mg/dL).Eligible patients were identified from a roster of patients who had undergone testing at a nonvascular laboratory between September 1, 2001, and January 31, 2002, and were found to have evidence of PAD, defined as an ankle-brachial index of 0.9 or less. We thoroughly reviewed patients' electronic medical records. Backward elimination multivariate logistic regression modeling was used to Identify factors associated with reaching the goal LDL-C level.Among 143 patients with PAD, 105 (73%) met the goal LDL-C level. Lipid-lowering therapy was prescribed for 109 (76%). Lower diastolic blood pressure and lower weight were independently associated with an LDL-C level of less than 100 mg/dL.We found higher rates of lipid-lowering therapy in patients with PAD than reported previously. Patients with diabetes mellitus or coronary artery disease were not more likely to meet the goal LDL-C level than those without these comorbidities. Clinical practice may be catching up to clinical guidelines.
