The pathological changes of abdominal and peripheral arteries in familial hypercholesterolemia--the result of high-resolution color Doppler ultrasonography. To explore changes of abdominal and peripheral arteries in familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) patients with definite etiopathogenesis by high-resolution color Doppler ultrasound to identify the arteriosclerotic progression of FH patients and offer the valuable foundation for clinic treatment.Observe the interior-media thickness (IMT), stenotic degree and hemodynamics change of arteries by ultrasonography in six children in five family constellations (index case) and six normal controls.There was significant difference between FH and control group in IMT of the posterior wall in left external carotid artery (origination), right common carotid artery (approaching piece) and IMT of the anterior and posterior wall right common carotid artery (intermediate piece) (P = 0.015). Significant thickening of IMT was not observed in vertebral arteries, subclavicular arteries, abdominal aorta, renal arteries, iliac arteries and popliteal arteries both in FH and control group.The arteriosclerotic aggravation of FH patients could not be revealed by the level of the blood fat, but could be revealed correctly by ultrasonography. It is possible to provide significant foundation for individualized treatment of FH patients by regular non-invasive ultrasonography.
