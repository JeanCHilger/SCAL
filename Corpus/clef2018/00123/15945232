Endothelial function and ischemic heart disease. The original hypothesis of the development of human atherosclerosis and ischemic heart disease called "response-to-injury" suggested the loss of integrity of the endothelium as the first step of the process. The recent version of this hypothesis emphasizes the term of endothelial dysfunction, that can be triggered by any of the well known cardiovascular risk factors. The atherosclerotic process, starting with endothelial dysfunction is a slow grade inflammatory process, promoting the oxidation of the low density lipoprotein molecules, activation of cell adhesion molecules as well as various ligands and cytokines, and activating immunological processes resulting in the development of unstable atherosclerotic plaque, followed by plaque rupture and formation of atherothrombotic lesions. Among the laboratory methods used for the detection of endothelial dysfunction, the flow mediated vasodilation (FMD) is increasingly known. A novel method is the laser Doppler flowmetry, still adapted to routine clinical tests. Clinical experiments are currently running with the coronarographic evaluation of intravascular flow velocity (slow coronary flow phenomenon), and also with the isolation and clinical evaluation of the circulating endothelial cells in patients with ischemic heart disease.
