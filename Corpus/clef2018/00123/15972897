Combined training of GPs and practice-assistants on peripheral arterial disease: positive effects after six months. To improve the use of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) measurement, and management of patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) a combined training, targeting GPs and practice assistants (PAs) was developed. To measure the effect of the combined training on the management of patients with PAD, a cross-sectional study was performed.Fifty consecutive patients referred by GPs to a vascular surgery out-patient clinic were analysed. Six months after the training an additional fifty patients were included. In all patients the ABI measurement, risk factor management, and treatment as performed by the GP, prior to referral, were analysed.The measurement of the ABI significantly increased from 10% before the training to 53% after the training (GPs with training: 83%, GPs without training: 35% P: 0.001). The referral of patients with actual PAD significantly increased from 32% before the training to 70% after the training (GPs with training: 83%, GPs without training: 59%Within the limitations of a before and after study the combined training of GPs and PAs appears to be an effective method to increase ABI measurements and significantly improve adequate diagnostics.
