Association between carotid haemodynamics and inflammation in patients with essential hypertension. Previous studies have shown that high blood pressure causes chronic inflammation. Hypertensive patients are reported to have high-circulating levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). The pulsatility index (PI) and resistive index (RI) are used as markers of peripheral vascular resistance. In the present study, we evaluated the relationship between carotid haemodynamics and the proinflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and hs-CRP. In all, 41 patients with essential hypertension participated. The intima-media thickness (IMT), peak systolic velocity (pVs), peak diastolic velocity (pVd) and mean velocity (mV) in the common carotid artery were measured using ultrasound Doppler flow methods, and PI [(pVs-pVd)/mV] and RI [(pVs-pVd)/pVs] were calculated. Serum IL-6 and hs-CRP concentrations were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. IMT was positively correlated with age and pulse pressure. Both PI and RI were positively correlated with pulse pressure, IL-6 and hs-CRP. A multiple regression analysis revealed that PI and RI were independently associated with hs-CRP. These results suggested that carotid haemodynamic parameters such as PI and RI are associated with atherosclerosis and inflammation in hypertensive patients.
