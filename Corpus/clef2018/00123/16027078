Assessment of hemodynamics in patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome after interventional treatment. To study the changes in morphology of liver and spleen and hemodynamics of the patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) after interventional treatment.The dimensions of liver and spleen were detected by routine ultrasonography in 30 normal control subjects and 256 BCS patients before and after inventional therapy. Color duplex sonography was employed to measure the hemodynamic changes.Compared with the control group, BCS patients before interventional therapy showed obvious liver and spleen enlargements (P<0.005), specially the caudate lobe of the liver (P<0.001), which were significantly reduced 7 days after interventional treatment (P<0.005), but the spleen was still larger than that of the control group (P<0.005) even till 6 months after the therapy. Color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) revealed local high-speed blood flow in patients with stenosis of the inferior vena cave (IVC), but color flow was not detected in patients with IVC obstruction, who had hepatic vein dilation (P<0.005) with slowed blood flow and collateral formation of in the liver, as well as decreased velocity of blood flow in the portal vein. After interventional treatment, the diameter of the involved IVC increased with blood flow restoration and the size and shape of the stent were detected clearly. The velocity of blood flow was increased in both the hepatic and portal veins (P<0.005).Interventional therapy can relieve obstruction of blood flow in the liver and improve the hemodynamics of patients with BCS.
