Uterine arteriovenous malformation: a case report diagnosed by sonohysterography. The aim of this report is to describe a case of uterine arteriovenous malformation that occurred in a 54-year-old postmenopausal woman referring recurrent postmenopausal bleeding, after two years of tamoxifen therapy.Medical therapy with GnRh agonists was unsuccessful. Ultrasound and Doppler flow ultrasound scanning were normal and the following hysteroscopy was normal as well.Hysterosonography performed on the patient made us suspect the presence of an intracavitary vascular lesion which was confirmed histologically after hysterectomy.In our case hysterosonography allowed us--by creating optimal contrast between the uterine wall and the uterine cavity--to suspect and identify the lesion and to recognize the typical ultrasound findings of this pathology not visualized with standard transvaginal ultrasound.
