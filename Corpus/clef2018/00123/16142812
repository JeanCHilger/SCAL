Acute upper extremity arterial occlusion: a novel role for the use of rheolytic thrombectomy and intravascular ultrasound. Acute peripheral arterial occlusion may be caused by thrombosis or embolism. The objectives of therapy are to preserve limb and life by restoration of blood flow. Thrombolytic therapy has been the mainstay, but is limited by a high risk of bleeding. Surgical treatment, often required, is invasive with higher rates of morbidity and mortality. Rheolytic thrombectomy offers a percutaneous means of thrombus removal. A 62-year-old man with chronic atrial fibrillation, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, and hypothyroidism presented with sudden onset of left arm pain. His medications included warfarin, digoxin, amiodarone, and synthroid. Examination revealed a harsh 3/6 systolic nonradiating murmur. The left arm was cold and weak with absent pulses. Laboratory data showed a prothrombin time (PT) of 12 sec and an international normalized ratio of 1.4. After heparinization, angiography was performed, showing a total occlusion of the brachial artery. A rheolytic thrombectomy catheter (RTC) was introduced to remove the thrombus. The RTC run time was 90 sec. Flow was restored to the vessel, but sluggish with angiographic evidence of stenosis. Intravascular ultrasound was performed, revealing a high-grade fibromuscular stenosis. Balloon angioplasty was performed, followed by intracatheter injection of alteplase restoring normal flow. Sudden arterial occlusion is a medical emergency, which can result in limb loss. RTC's have demonstrated a reduced need for thrombolytic agents and surgical intervention, thereby decreasing complications, procedural time, and resource utilization. While most reports have focused on infra-aortic thromboses, this case highlights its utility in the arm.
