Revascularization interventions in the left coronary artery system: transesophageal Doppler ultrasound study. To elucidate the role of evaluation of coronary reserve in coronary sinus by transesophageal doppler for assessment of efficacy of various revascularization interventions.Patients with isolated stenoses of either left anterior descending or circumflex coronary artery subjected to stenting (n=14) and with two vessel disease subjected to bypass surgery (n=20). Dipyridamole was used as a stress agent. Coronary reserve was calculated as ratio of peak hyperemic to baseline antegrade coronary sinus blood flow velocity (CR(P)) and as ratio of hyperemic to baseline antegrade coronary sinus volume blood flow (CR(VBF)).In patients with atherosclerotic lesions in the system of left coronary artery normalization of CR(P) after stenting of single vessel stenoses and of CR(VBF) after bypass surgery in two vessel disease were markers of efficacy of revascularization with sensitivity 75 and 71%, respectively.
