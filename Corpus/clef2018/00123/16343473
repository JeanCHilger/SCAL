Classification of carotid artery Doppler signals in the early phase of atherosclerosis using complex-valued artificial neural network. In this study, carotid arterial Doppler ultrasound signals were acquired from left carotid arteries of 38 patients and 40 healthy volunteers. The patient group had an established diagnosis of the early phase of atherosclerosis through coronary or aortofemoropopliteal angiographies. Results were classified using complex-valued artificial neural network (CVANN). Principal component analysis (PCA) and fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM) algorithm were used to make a CVANN system more effective. For this aim, before classifying with CVANN, PCA method was used for feature extraction in PCA-CVANN architecture and FCM algorithm was used for data set reduction in FCM-CVANN architecture. Training and test data were selected randomly using 10-fold cross validation. PCA-CVANN and FCM-CVANN architectures classified healthy and unhealthy subjects for training and test data with about 100% correct classification rate. These results shown that PCA-CVANN and FCM-CVANN classified Doppler signals successfully.
