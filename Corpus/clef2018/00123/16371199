Underrecognized peripheral arterial disease in patients with acute coronary syndrome: prevalence of traditional and emergent cardiovascular risk factors. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) frequently coexists with coronary artery disease. Our objective was to determine the prevalence of traditional and emergent cardiovascular risk factors in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), with or without PAD.A prospective study of 141 consecutive patients (< 70 years old) admitted to our hospital with ACS was performed. PAD was diagnosed when the ankle-brachial index (ABI) was < or = 0.9. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors were evaluated. C-reactive protein, homocysteine, amyloid A, lipoprotein (a), fibrinogen, apolipoprotein A1, and apolipoprotein B100 serum levels, and microalbuminuria were measured. Specific genotypes were also determined.Patients were divided into two groups according to whether PAD was present (37 patients, 26% of total, ACS-PAD group) or absent (104 patients, ACS group). In the ACS-PAD group, patients were older, and diabetes and hypertension were significantly more common. Moreover, levels of C-reactive protein (3.1 mg/L vs 2.18 mg/L P<.05), homocysteine (11.45 mmol/L vs 9.4 mmol/LSeveral traditional and emergent cardiovascular risk factors were more prevalent in patients with acute coronary syndrome and peripheral arterial disease. Moreover, some factors were independent predictors of peripheral arterial disease.
