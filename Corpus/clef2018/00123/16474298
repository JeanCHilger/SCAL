Revascularization in distal lesions of upper extremity arteries. A study was made of the course of ischemia and hemodynamic disorders in 53 patients with occlusion of the distal arterial system of the upper extremities. Circulation was examined by ultrasound Doppler, tetrapolar rheology, transcutaneous oxymetry and angiography. Critical ischemia was discovered in 58.5% of patients. In occlusion of one of the forearm arteries, extremity circulation was made for. Circulatory decompensation was recorded in occlusion of both forearm arteries with intact distal bed and non-functioning palmar arches of the hand as well as in lesions of hand and finger arteries. All 53 patients were operated on, 66 operations were accomplished using magnifying optic appliances. Provided the distal bed was well preserved, use was made of direct revascularization techniques (36) whereas non-standard methods were employed in the event of its obliteration: arterialization of the outlets of the subcutaneous veins of the hand and autotransplantation of the greater omentum (30). Beneficial results were obtained in 91.5% and unsatisfactory in 8.5% of patients. The lethality accounted for 1.2% while the incidence of amputations was quoted as 5.7%. Good results offer the period as long as 5 years were well preserved in 87.6% of patients. Our experience indicates the efficacy of the use of revascularization techniques for the treatment of different versions of occlusion of the distal segments of upper extremity arteries.
