Clinical outcomes from hepatic artery stenting in liver transplantation. Hepatic artery stenosis after liver transplantation may affect liver function and result in hepatic artery thrombosis. Surgical reconstruction has been the first choice for treatment. Interventional radiologic technique can be used, but there is no report on long-term outcome. The aim of this paper is to assess current outcome and complications of hepatic artery stenting. Twenty-six adult patients were stented for hepatic artery stenosis between 1998 and 2003. Nine patients had previous surgical reconstruction for hepatic artery stenosis. Seventeen patients suffered newly developed hepatic artery stenosis. Three patients were retransplanted. After stenting, the patients were followed by Doppler ultrasound at day 1, 1 month, and 6 months. Angiography was scheduled in 6 months. Four patients died within 2 months. The other 22 patients were followed for mean 31 +/- 14 months (8-71 months). One of 22 patients died from renal failure 2 years later. Twelve patients' hepatic arteries looked normal after stenting. Restenosis was seen in 8 patients (36%). Other complications were artery thrombosis (n = 1) and long segment stricture (n = 1). In 2 patients (25%) restenosis resulted in thrombosis. Six of the 8 patients who developed recurrent stenosis were successfully treated interventionally: restent (n = 5) and balloon dilation (n = 3). However, 3 patients (38%) restenosed. Kaplan-Meier complication-free survival was 54% at 1 year after stenting. In conclusion, hepatic artery stenting is a viable treatment for hepatic artery stenosis with reasonable results. Stenting is useful as adjuvant treatment after surgical revision.
