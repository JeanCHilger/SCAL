Atrial and ventricular echocardiographic correlates of the extent of pulmonary embolism in the elderly. Acute pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) can be associated with right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. The relative importance of individual echocardiographic parameters, including those suggesting interdependence between right and left heart chambers, in predicting thromboembolic burden in elderly patients with acute PTE is unknown.We retrospectively studied the transthoracic echocardiograms of 63 elderly patients (age 71 +/- 16 years) with acute PTE, and assessed which individual echocardiographic parameters identified more than 30% pulmonary artery obstruction on the basis of quantitative ventilation/perfusion pulmonary scintigraphy.RV hypokinesis (visual grade 0-3, P = .02), and the quantitative parameters RV end-systolic area (P = .005) and RV ejection area (P = .01) were associated with more extensive pulmonary artery obstruction. Although right atrial end-systolic area and RV end-diastolic area did not correlate with extent of PTE, the ratio of RV:left ventricular end-diastolic area (P = .003), and ratio of right:left atrial end-systolic area (P = .004), were strongly associated with the extent of pulmonary artery obstruction. These transthoracic echocardiographic parameters were independent of clinical variables such as prior chronic lung disease, congestive cardiac failure, or prior PTE.RV systolic dysfunction, RV end-systolic dilatation, right:left atrial end-systolic area ratio, and RV:left ventricular end-diastolic area ratio correlate with extent of PTE in the elderly.
