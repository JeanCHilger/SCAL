Association of glucose metabolism, smoking and cardiovascular risk factors with incident peripheral arterial disease: the DESIR study. We determined the 6-year incidence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in a French population and assessed the association of glucose metabolism, smoking, cardiovascular risk factors and physical activity with incident PAD.Participants from the French Data from a Epidemiological Study on the Insulin Resistance Syndrome (DESIR) were studied. Participants analysed were 30-65 years (at baseline) and had complete data (n=3805) after 6 years of follow-up. Diabetes was diagnosed according to the 1999 WHO criteria on the basis of fasting plasma glucose results or previous diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. The ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) and a claudication question were used to classify PAD.The 6-year incidence of PAD (defined by ABPI<0.9 and or claudication present) among those with normal fasting glucose (NFG) and free of PAD at baseline was 5.1%. Among those with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) at baseline the incidence of PAD was 4.9% and among those with diabetes mellitus at baseline the incidence of PAD was 9.8%. The incidence of PAD among those who maintained NFG over 6 years was 4.7% and among those who progressed to diabetes over 6 years was 10.2%. Those who progressed from NFG or IFG to diabetes over 6 years were twice as likely to develop PAD compared to those who maintained NFG over 6 years, after adjustment for age and sex (OR (95% CI), 2.22 (1.12-4.42)). Independent risk factors for incident PAD using baseline population characteristics were diabetes (OR (95% CI) 2.11 (1.25-3.55)), systolic BP 122-135mmHg 1.06 (0.70-1.60), >135mmHg 1.54 (1.04-2.27) and current smoking 1.60 (1.10-2.34) after multivariate adjustment for age, sex, cholesterol, triglycerides and waist circumference.This French study shows that those who progress to diabetes are twice as likely to develop PAD, compared to those who maintain NFG. Peripheral arterial disease is a treatable condition and more aggressive management of atherosclerotic risk factors could reduce the numbers of people who develop PAD.
