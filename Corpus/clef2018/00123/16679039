The low incidence of surgery for non-cardiac vascular disease in UK Asians may be explained by a low prevalence of disease. Firstly, to compare rates of surgery for non-cardiac vascular disease in Caucasians and Asians and secondarily to assess the prevalence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in the male UK Asian population.Analysis of a prospective database followed by an epidemiological survey of 100 unselected Pakistani males, in which demographic and anthropometric data were collected alongside aortic ultrasonography and measurement of ankle: brachial pressure index (ABPI).Although 14.1% of our catchment area is Asian, after correction for age, they only accounted for 64/2268 (2.8%) of procedures for PAD and AAA. Specifically, Asians were 10 times less likely to undergo AAA repair and 3 times less likely to undergo procedures for lower limb peripheral bypass, amputation and endovascular intervention. In the epidemiological study, 26 subjects had a significant history of ischaemic heart disease, 21 were diabetic, 32 had hypertension and 60 were current or ex-smokers. Median aortic diameter [IQR] was 17.6 mm [16.3-19.1 mm] and no subject had an AAA. In 200 limbs, median ABPI [IQR] was 1.12 [1.04-1.21]. Only 2 patients had an ABPI < 0.9.Despite a high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and ischaemic heart disease, the prevalence of PAD and AAA is much lower than would have been expected in an age- and sex-matched Caucasian population. These data suggest that the reduced incidence of surgery for PAD and AAA in UK Asians is due to a low prevalence of disease.
