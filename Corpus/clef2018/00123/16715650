Ankle brachial index as a marker of atherosclerosis in Chinese patients with high cardiovascular risk. To obtain reliable data on the epidemiology, co-morbidities and risk factor profile of peripheral arterial disease (PAD), we evaluated the clinical significance of the ankle brachial index (ABI) as an indicator of PAD in Chinese patients at high cardiovascular (CV) risk. ABI was measured in 5,646 Chinese patients at high CV risk, and PAD was defined as an ABI<0.9 in either leg. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with PAD. A total of 5,263 patients were analyzed, 52.9% male, mean age 67.3 years, mean body mass index (BMI) 24.2 kg/m2, mean systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) 139/80.7 mmHg. The prevalence of PAD in the total group of patients was 25.4%, and the prevalence was higher in females than in males (27.1% vs. 23.9% odds ratio [OR]: 1.64). Patients with PAD were older than those without PAD (72.3+/-9.9 years vs. 65.6+/-11.7 years
