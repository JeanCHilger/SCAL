Peripheral arterial disease: recognition and medical management. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is common but has a variable presentation and is often unrecognized and undertreated. Patients with PAD have an increased risk of cardiovascular events and death. The ankle-brachial index is a quick, reliable diagnostic tool that also helps assess disease severity and prognosis. Treatment goals for PAD are to improve symptoms, enhance functional performance, prevent limb amputation, and reduce cardiovascular complications.
