Performance of subclinical arterial disease detection as a screening test for coronary heart disease. Traditional risk factors are poor screening tests for coronary heart disease, whereas clinical arterial disease represents its strongest predictor. This raises the question whether subclinical arterial disease may also predict coronary disease. Using published data of prospective studies of subclinical arterial disease, we calculated the incidence of coronary event associated with the absence or presence of atherosclerosis as defined by dichotomous characterization of the following markers: low or high intima-media thickness or the absence or presence of plaque, assessed by carotid ultrasound zero or high total coronary artery calcium score assessed by computed tomography
