Relevant factors of microalbuminuria in aged patients with essential hypertension. To investigate the relationship between microalbuminuria and endothelial-dependent relaxing function and atherosclerosis of common carotid artery (CCA) in aged patients with essential hypertension (EH).Sixty-four aged EH patients were recruited. According to the albumin excretion rate (AER) in the urine measured by immunoturbidimetry, patients were divided into 2 groups: normoalbuminuria group (NAU group) and microalbuminuria group (MAU group). Thirty aged persons without EH were served as the control group. The endothelium-dependent relaxing function of blood vessels, intima-media thickness (IMT) and the plaque of CCA were measured by color Doppler ultrasound.The flow-mediated dilation in the MAU group [(4.98+/-1.35)%] and that in the NAU group [(6.31+/-1.14)%] were significantly lower than that in the control group [(9.09+/-1.83)%, P<0.05, respectively], especially lower in the MAU group. The IMT of CCA in the MAU group [(0.97+/-0.19)mm] and that in the NAU group [(0.86+/-0.10)mm] were significantly thicker than that in the control group [(0.78+/-0.13)mm] (P<0.05, respectively), especially thicker in the MAU group. The analysis of multiple stepwise regression showed that the microalbuminuria was successively related to EDF, the IMT of CCA, the plaque index of CCA, systolic blood pressure, etc.EDF is impaired, and there is the atherosclerosis of CCA in aged patients with EH. Microalbuminuria correlates with the decrease of endothelium-dependent relaxing function and the IMT of CCA in aged patients with EH.
