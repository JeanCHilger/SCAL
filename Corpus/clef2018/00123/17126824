Effects of selective LDL apheresis on plasma concentrations of ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and P-selectin in diabetic patients with arteriosclerosis obliterans and receiving maintenance hemodialysis. Arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO) is a serious complication in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) caused by diabetic nephropathy. Adsorption of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) has been performed to treat ASO. While efficacy of this treatment has been reported in limb ischemia, the mechanism underlying the benefit remains unclear. We investigated how LDL adsorption affected soluble adhesion molecules P-selectin, an endothelial and platelet activation markerSelective LDL adsorption by dextran sulfate columns (LDL apheresis) was performed weekly for 10 weeks to treat eight hemodialysis patients with ASO, ESRD, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Serum was sampled before and immediately after apheresis.LDL apheresis was performed safely. After LDL apheresis lipid concentrations were significantly reduced and clinical findings, such as Fontaine's classification and ankle brachial pressure index values, were improved. Pretreatment concentrations of soluble intercellular and vascular cell adhesion molecules (sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1) and also P-selectin were higher in patients than healthy controls. After apheresis these decreased, especially P-selectin. IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha concentrations before apheresis were similar to those in controls and were unaffected by treatment.Effectiveness of LDL apheresis against ASO may involve decreased endothelial cell and platelet activation.
