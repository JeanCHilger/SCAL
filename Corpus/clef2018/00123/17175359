Stent placement in pediatric patients with hepatic artery stenosis or thrombosis after liver transplantation. Hepatic artery stenosis (HAS) and thrombosis (HAT) after orthotopic liver transplantation remain significant causes of graft loss. Postoperative HAT follows approximately 5% to 19% of orthotopic liver transplantation. It is seen more frequently in pediatric patients. In the past, repeat transplantation was considered the first choice for therapy. Recently, interventional radiological techniques, such as thrombolysis, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, or stent placement in the hepatic artery, have been suggested, but little data exist related to stent placement in the thrombosed hepatic artery during the early postoperative period in pediatric patients. Between March 2000 and March 2005, percutaneous endoluminal stent placement was performed in seven pediatric liver transplant patients. HAT or HAS initially diagnosed in all cases by Doppler ultrasound then confirmed angiographically. We intervened in four cases of hepatic artery stenosis and three cases of hepatic artery occlusion. Stents were placed in all patients. Three ruptures were seen during percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the hepatic artery using a covered coronary stents on the first, fifth day, or 17th postoperative day. In one patient, dissection of the origin of the common hepatic artery developed owing to a guiding sheath, and a second stent was placed to cover the dissected segment. The other two hepatic artery stents remained patent. In one stent became occluded at 3 months after the intervention with no clinical problems. Follow-up ranged from 9 to 40 months. In conclusion, early and late postoperative stent placement in the graft hepatic artery was technically feasible.
