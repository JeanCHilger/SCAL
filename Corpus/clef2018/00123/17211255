Left ventricular hypertrophy is present in one-half of newly-diagnosed peripheral arterial disease patients. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) patients are at high risk of cardiac death. Coincidental but silent coronary disease is obviously a major contributor but left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) could be a second major contributor.To investigate whether LVH could really be making a large contribution to cardiac death in PAD, we assessed the prevalence of LVH when PAD was first diagnosed.The prevalence of echo LVH when left ventricular mass was indexed to body surface area was 50%. Although office blood pressure and 24-h blood pressure were both significantly higher in those with LVH, in clinical practice, a contemporaneous blood pressure measurement (office or 24 h) at the time of PAD diagnosis would only partially identify those with LVH. For example, an office blood pressure cut-off of < 140/90 mmHg was found in 27% of all LVH cases and a 24-h blood pressure cut-off of < 125/80 mmHg was found in 24% of all LVH cases.In conclusion, there is already a high prevalence of LVH in patients at first diagnosis of PAD. LVH is therefore common enough in PAD patients to potentially make a major contribution to cardiac death, which means that future research should now investigate whether screening for and regressing LVH when present would actually reduce cardiac deaths over and above merely achieving target blood pressure.
