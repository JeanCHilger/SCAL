Leg blood flow measurements using venous occlusion plethysmography during head-up tilt. We tested whether venous occlusion plethysmography (VOP) is an appropriate method to measure calf blood flow (CBF) during head-up tilt (HUT). CBF measured with VOP was compared with superficial femoral artery blood flow as measured by Doppler ultrasound during incremental tilt angles. Measurements of both methods correlated well (r = 0.86). Reproducibility of VOP was fair in supine position and 30 degrees HUT (CV: 11%-15%). This indicates that VOP is an applicable tool to measure leg blood flow during HUT, especially up to 30 degrees HUT.
