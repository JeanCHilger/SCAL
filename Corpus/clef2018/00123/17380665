Treating iliac artery occlusive disease with subintimal angioplasty. To assess the value of subintimal angioplasty in treating patients with iliac artery occlusive disease.We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 13 patients with iliac artery occlusion who received subintimal wire placement followed by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stent placement in our hospital from May 2004 to August 2006.Initial success was obtained in all the 13 patients with an improvement in both the symptoms and the mean ankle-brachial index of 0.55 (range: 0.39-0.94, P = 0.004) without any complication. During the follow-up (range: 3-21 months mean: 12 months), the one-year stent patency rate reached 100%.Subintimal angioplasty is a valuable approach to treat iliac artery occlusion with reliable efficacy and safety.
