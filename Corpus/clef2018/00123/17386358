Impact of claudication and its treatment on quality of life. Improvement in quality of life is the ultimate goal of healthcare for the treatment of intermittent claudication. Until recently, the measures of success after therapy were those derived from the vascular laboratory, including ankle-brachial indices and ankle and toe pressures. There are now several validated and reliable survey tools that can assess patient-reported quality of life in a generic or disease-specific manner. Major survey instruments are reviewed. The information gathered through these quality-of-life assessment tools is important to all those involved in the care of patients with peripheral arterial disease. Although claudication is neither life- nor limb-threatening, it has a significant negative impact on quality of life, as measured by these instruments. Patients so afflicted report more bodily pain, worse physical function, and worse perceived health, in addition to limited walking ability. These measures of quality of life do not correlate with standard parameters of ankle-brachial index or ankle pressures. Treatment of the claudicant with exercise therapy and percutaneous or open revascularization also impacts quality of life. Each of these modalities is capable of improving quality of life, but some are associated with decline over time. The major benefits and risks to quality of life of these specific forms of treatment for the claudicant are reviewed. This data demonstrates that patients suffering from symptoms of intermittent claudication are best served by therapies that address their major self-reported impediments to quality of life.
