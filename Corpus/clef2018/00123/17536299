The ankle brachial index in chronic spinal cord injury: a pilot study. Recent case reports implicate peripheral vascular disease (PVD) as an etiology for pressure ulcers (PU), failed myocutaneous flap surgeries, and amputation in spinal cord injury (SCI). Early detection of PVD is complicated by motor and sensory deficits in this population. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) is used to quantify PVD in the able-bodied population. We hypothesized that the ABI would be a useful screening tool for detecting PVD in patients with SCI. Differences in baseline blood pressure, as well as motor and sympathetic function, could potentially alter ABI, so values were studied in a sample of patients with SCI without risk factors or signs of PVD, and compared to those in able-bodied controls without PVD.ABI values were measured in 15 healthy individuals with chronic complete SCI above the T6 level, who had no evidence for risk factors or physical findings of PVD, and compared with the values for a group of 10 able-bodied controls.No statistically significant difference in ABI was found between patients with SCI and the able-bodied comparison group. There was no statistically significant correlation between ABI and post-injury duration or incidence of PU.ABI may prove to be a useful screening device in individuals with SCI. Follow-up studies are needed to confirm these findings and to ascertain that the ABI correlates with presence and severity of PVD in patients with SCI who have risk factors and signs of PVD.
