A pilot study showing an association between platelet hyperactivity and the severity of peripheral arterial disease. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a chronic fibroproliferative inflammatory condition associated with progressive vascular stenosis. We set out to determine the relationship between spontaneous stirring-induced platelet aggregation in whole blood and the severity of lower-limb PAD, represented by the ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI). ABPI was determined pre- and post-exercise in 31 subjects (20 men and 11 women) with established PAD. Platelets counts were determined in EDTA blood (total count) and in citrated whole blood after stirring in the absence of added ADP (spontaneous aggregation) and in the presence of added ADP (ADP-induced) for 3 min at 37 degrees C. Aggregation was calculated as a percentage of the total platelet count. Spontaneous platelet aggregation showed an inverse correlation with pre-exercise ABPI (r = -0.32 P < 0.05) and ADP-induced aggregation correlated inversely with post-exercise ABPI (r = -0.34
