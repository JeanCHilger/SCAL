Determinants of arterial wall stiffness and peripheral artery occlusive disease in nondiabetic hemodialysis patients. Aortic pulse wave velocity (Ao-PWV) and ankle-brachial blood pressure index (ABPI) are significant prognostic factors in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Diabetes mellitus (DM) promotes changes in arterial walls, including marked increases in Ao-PWV and decreases in ABPI. To determine the prevalence of peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) as well as the clinical variables useful in predicting these changes in nondiabetic patients with ESRD undergoing hemodialysis (HD), we performed a cross-sectional study in a cohort of 143 patients. Ao-PWV and ABPI were measured simultaneously and compared with several annual biochemical measurements and other clinical variables. The prevalence of PAOD in our cohort was 30.5%. In univariate regression analysis, Ao-PWV correlated positively with age, heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), pulse pressure (PP) and HbA1c, and negatively with serum albumin and ABPI. ABPI correlated negatively with age, HD duration, systolic BP, PP, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and positively with serum albumin and bone mineral density. In a step-down multiple regression analysis, HbA1c was identified as an independent determinant of Ao-PWV along with age, HD duration, HR and mean BP, while hs-CRP was an independent contributor to ABPI along with age, HD duration, PP and LDL cholesterol. Our results suggest that HD promotes aortic wall stiffness and PAOD progression. We recommend the monitoring of HbA1c to allow the prediction of aortic wall stiffness in nondiabetic ESRD patients. Our results did not confirm the influence of insulin resistance on the development of arterial sclerosis lesions.
