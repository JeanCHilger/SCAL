Metabolic syndrome is not associated with markers of subclinical atherosclerosis, serum adiponectin and endogenous androgen concentrations in Japanese men with Type 2 diabetes. Metabolic syndrome is characterized by its association with certain cardiovascular disease risk factors. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between metabolic syndrome and markers of subclinical atherosclerosis, serum adiponectin and endogenous androgen concentrations in Japanese men with Type 2 diabetes.Using the 2005 International Diabetes Federation (IDF) definition, we assessed the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in 424 consecutive men with Type 2 diabetes aged 40-75 years in a cross-sectional study. We compared characteristics including ultrasonographic carotid atherosclerosis markers, pulse-wave velocity (PWV), and serum adiponectin, free testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEA-S) concentrations in diabetic patients with and without the metabolic syndrome.The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in Japanese men with Type 2 diabetes was 46.9%. Men with the metabolic syndrome had higher urinary albumin excretion rate than those without. Carotid intima-media thickness (0.97 +/- 0.26 vs. 0.91 +/- 0.18 mm), plaque score [3.3 (1.5-8.1) vs. 3.8 (1.3-6.2)], PWV (1818 +/- 331 vs. 1749 +/- 331 cm/s) and ankle-brachial index (1.10 +/- 0.14 vs. 1.08 +/- 0.16) did not differ significantly between patients with and without the metabolic syndrome. Similarly, serum adiponectin [3.70 (2.06-6.09) vs. 4.65 (3.09-7.02) microg/ml], free testosterone (36.4 +/- 10.7 vs. 34.7 +/- 11.1 pmol/l), and DHEA-S concentrations (3.29 +/- 1.83 vs. 3.17 +/- 1.63 micromol/l) did not differ significantly between groups,The metabolic syndrome, as defined by the IDF, is not significantly associated with subclinical atherosclerosis markers, serum adiponectin, or endogenous androgen concentrations in Japanese men with Type 2 diabetes.
