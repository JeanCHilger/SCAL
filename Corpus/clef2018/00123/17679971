Pathophysiological characteristics of microcirculatory disorders in chronic arterial ischaemia of lower limbs. Presented herein are the findings of studying the peculiarities of the systemic and regional haemodynamics in patients with obliterating atherosclerosis of the arteries of the lower limbs. We examined a total of 186 patients with stage I-IV chronic arterial ischaemia of the lower extremities using the following methods: computer-assisted TV microscopy of the vessels of the conjunctiva of the eyeball and of the skin of the lower limbs, laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) and transcutaneous determination of oxygen tension. Revealed were: spastic, congestive, Presented herein are the findings of studying the peculiarities of the systemic and regional haemodynamics in patients with obliterating atherosclerosis of the arteries of the lower limbs.

Revealed were: spastic, congestive, spastic-atonic and stasic forms of microcirculatory disorders. It was determined that microcirculatory disorders in obliterating atherosclerosis of the lower limbs are systemic, to be revealed both in the extremities affected and in the conjunctiva of the eyeball. A pathophysiologically substantiated classification of microcirculatory disorders is proposed herein.
