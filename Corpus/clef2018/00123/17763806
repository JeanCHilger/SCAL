Measuring the blood pressure in both arms is subject to discussion. The recommendation to measure, at least once, the blood pressure in both arms is not without dispute. Several observations argue against such a recommendation. These include left-to-right asymmetry in cases of vascular rigidity and atherosclerotic lesions in both arms, and the variability of blood pressure. The latter may preclude any meaningful comparison between measurements taken in the left and right arm if these measurements are not obtained simultaneously.
