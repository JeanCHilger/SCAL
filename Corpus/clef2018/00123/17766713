Correlations of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and atherosclerosis in Japanese type 2 diabetic patients. The elevated level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HSCRP) and aortic stiffness are associated with high mortality in type 2 diabetic patients. We tested the hypothesis that the HSCRP correlates with aortic stiffness and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetic patients.The study consisted of 46 Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes and high HSCRP group (0.3-1.0 mg/dl, age: 57+/-5 years, mean+/-s.d.) and a control group of 55 age-matched patients with low HSCRP group (<0.3 mg/dl, 57+/-6 years). Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (BaPWV) was measured by automatic oscillometric method and was used as an index of atherosclerosis.The body mass index (BMI) values (P<0.05) and waist circumferences (P<0.0005) and the waist-to-hip ratios (P<0.05) were higher in the high HSCRP group than in the low HSCRP group. The BaPWV was higher in the high HSCRP group than in the low HSCRP group (P<0.0001). Fasting plasma glucose (FPG P<0.005) and insulin concentrations (P<0.0001), and the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index (P<0.0001), were higher in the high HSCRP group than in the low HSCRP group. Multiple regression analysis showed that HSCRP levels were independently predicted by BaPWV and HOMA index.Our results indicate that the elevated level of HSCRP in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes is characterized by increased aortic stiffness and insulin resistance, and that the BaPWV and HOMA index are independent predictors of HSCRP.
