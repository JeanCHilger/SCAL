The effect of current cigarette smoking on calf muscle hemoglobin oxygen saturation in patients with intermittent claudication. The purpose of this study was to compare calf muscle hemoglobin oxygen saturation response during exercise between smokers and non-smokers with peripheral arterial disease. Patients limited by intermittent claudication who were smokers (n = 12) were compared with those who had not smoked (n = 28) for at least 1 year prior to investigation. Ankle/brachial index (ABI) measurements were obtained with Doppler ultrasound, and maximal calf blood flow was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography. Hemoglobin oxygen saturation (StO2) of the calf muscle, initial claudication distance (ICD), and absolute claudication distance (ACD) were obtained during a graded treadmill test. Smokers refrained from smoking on the morning of the test. Smokers had similar ABI values compared with non-smokers (0.70 +/- 0.26 vs 0.73 +/- 0.23 [mean +/- SD] p = 0.808), whereas the smokers had lower values for maximal calf blood flow (8.71 +/- 5.76 %/min vs 11.48 +/- 4.46 %/min
