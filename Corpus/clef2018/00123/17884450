Correlations between homocysteine levels and atherosclerosis in Japanese type 2 diabetic patients. Elevated total plasma homocysteine (tHcy) level and aortic stiffness are associated with high mortality in type 2 diabetic patients. We tested the hypothesis that tHcy correlates with aortic stiffness and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetic patients. The study consisted of 40 Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and high tHcy levels (mean age +/- SD, 57 +/- 7 years) and a control group of 45 age-matched patients with normal tHcy levels (mean age +/- SD, 57 +/- 6 years). Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (BaPWV) was measured by an automatic oscillometric method. Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity was used as an index of atherosclerosis. Body mass index values (P < .05), waist circumferences (P < .05), and the waist-to-hip ratios (P < .05) were larger in the high-tHcy group than in the normal-tHcy group. The BaPWV was higher in the high-tHcy group than in the normal-tHcy group (P < .0001). Fasting plasma glucose (P < .005) and insulin concentrations (P < .0001), and the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index (P < .0001) were higher in the high-tHcy group than in the normal-tHcy group. Multiple regression analysis showed that tHcy levels were independently predicted by BaPWV and the HOMA index. In conclusion, our results indicate that the elevated level of tHcy in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by increased aortic stiffness and insulin resistance, and that the BaPWV and the HOMA index are independent predictors of tHcy.
