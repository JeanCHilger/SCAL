Sequential assessment of urodynamic findings before and after transobturator tape procedure for female urodynamic stress incontinence. The objective of this study was to sequentially compare the urodynamic findings of patients with urodynamic stress incontinence before and after transobturator tape procedure. Between May 2004 and December 2005, 26 of 34 consecutive patients with urodynamic stress incontinence who underwent transobturator tape procedure were enrolled. The sequential urodynamic findings of each case were compared and analyzed. Based on pad test, the cure and improvement rates were 69.2 and 30.8%, respectively. A significant increase in pressure transmission ratio at maximal urethral pressure at 1 year postoperatively (p = 0.005) was observed after surgery. The improvement group (n = 8) had significantly lower preoperative maximal urethral closure pressure (45.4 vs 68.2 mmHg, p = 0.036) than did the cure group (n = 18). The postoperatively increased pressure transmission ratio at maximal urethral pressure appears to contribute to its cure for urodynamic stress incontinence.
