Non-invasive evaluation of pulmonary artery occlusion pressure in critically ill patients with mechanical ventilation. To compare the measurements of pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) by means of the use a pulmonary artery catheter and those obtained through a formula that relates the systolic artery pressure before and after a Valsalva maneuver.Prospective observational study.Medical-surgical intensive care unit.A total of 120 patients mechanically ventilated and with deep sedation who had pulmonary artery catheter and arterial line.Provocation of a Valsalva maneuver by maintaining airway pressure at 30 mmHg for 10 seconds that was subsequently released.PAOP measured at the end of expiration by means of the use of a pulmonary artery catheter, PAOP was calculated by means of the use of a formula that relates the systolic artery pressure before and after a Valsalva maneuver.There was a limited correlation between the measured PAOP and that calculated by means of the Valsalva maneuver in the total population (r=0.44, CI 95%: 0.28 to 0.57, p=0.0001). There was a better correlation in the post-surgical subgroup (r=0.518, CI 95%: 0.1055 to 0.7738, p=0.016) and in the sub-group of "Others diagnosis" (r=0.62, CI: 95%: 0.30 to 0.81, p=0.001).The prediction of the PAOP by means of the Valsalva maneuver showed a limited correlation with that obtained by means of the pulmonary artery catheter.
