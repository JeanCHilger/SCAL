Peripheral arterial occlusive disease and ankle-brachial index in patients who had coronary angiography. To evaluate the prevalence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in patients with coronary arterial disease. To evaluate the relation between ankle-brachial index (ABI) and coronary arterial disease, and its correlation with cardiovascular risk factors.ABI investigated with Doppler ultrasonic device. Clinical characteristics researched: age, gender, diabetes, hypertension, alcoholism, smoking and obesity.113 patients who had coronary angiography. First analyses: 2 groups - absence and presence of coronary arterial disease. Second analyses: 3 groups - Group 1 - absence of coronary lesion Group 2 - stenosis <70%90.76% of patients with coronary arterial disease presented PAD. There were significant difference including age (p<0.001), hypertension (p<0.001). smoking (p<0.001), body mass index (BMI) (p<0.001), systolic blood pressure (SBP) (p<0.001), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (p<0.001) and pulse pressure (PP) (p<0.001) and ABI (p<0.001) between patients with and without coronary lesion. There were significant difference including age (p<0.001), diabetes (p=0.030), hypertension (p<0.001), smoking (p<0.001), BMI (p<0.001), SBP (p<0.001), DBP (p<0.001) and PP (p<0.001) and ABI (p<0.001) between patients divided as severity of coronary arterial disease. There were significant difference including age (p<0.001), hypertension (p<0.001), smoking (p<0.001), BMI (p<0.001), SBP (p<0.001), DBP (p<0.001) and PP (p<0.001) between patients with and without PAD. By Logistic Regression Analysis, old obese patients with ABI<0.90 have a risk of coronary lesion of 98.93%.ITB<0.90 might be a marker of coronary arterial disease in patients at risk of cardiovascular diseases.
