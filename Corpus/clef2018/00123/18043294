Effects of chronic exercise on endothelial dysfunction and insulin signaling of cutaneous microvascular in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Abnormalities of the modulatory roles played by the endothelium and/or smooth muscle may be critical and initiating factors in the development of diabetic vascular disease. Decreased phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt pathway activity and impaired nitric oxide production through this pathway may play pivotal roles in the diabetes-induced vascular dysfunction. Several findings have demonstrated that exercise training has therapeutic and protective effects in type 1 diabetes and could correct endothelial dysfunction. The molecular mechanisms, however, are only partially understood.Male Wistar rats (220+/-10 g, N=60) were made diabetic by streptozotocin (60 mg/kg, subcutaneously). After 1 week of diabetes induction, animals were submitted to exercise training for 10 weeks on a treadmill. To characterize cutaneous microvascular responses by laser Doppler flowmetery, animals were deeply anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (60 mg/kg) and placed on a heating pad. A rectal thermometer was inserted and body temperature was maintained at 37+/-0.5 degrees C. A tracheotomy was performed to minimize respiratory difficulties. Systemic arterial blood pressure and heart rate were measured by using a tail-cuff during assessment of cutaneous blood flow.(i) Acetylcholine-induced cutaneous perfusion were increased significantly by training in the diabetic groups (ii) Cutaneous microvascular responses to sodium nitroprusside did not alter in control and diabetic animals by trainingChronic exercise improved endothelium-dependent dilatation and potentiated insulin vascular function, possibly by PI3-kinase pathway in diabetic rats.
