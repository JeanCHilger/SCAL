Coronary artery stenosis in asymptomatic child after arterial switch operation: detection by transthoracic colour-flow doppler echocardiography. Arterial switch operation (ASO) has become the definitive anatomical correction for transposition of great arteries (TGA). Left coronary artery (LCA) ostial stenosis was detected by transthoracic Doppler echocardiography (TTDE) as a flame like colour flow diastolic signal and coronary flow reserve (CFR) was low, 1.3. It was treated successfully by a drug-eluted stent. These findings could be diagnostic for coronary ostial stenosis.Coronary artery stenosis can be detected with colour Doppler echocardiography. Assessment of CFR provides information of the physiological significance of the coronary stenosis.
