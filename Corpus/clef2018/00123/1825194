Peripheral excimer laser angioplasty. The indications, methods and clinical results. Between March 1989 and January 1990, percutaneous transluminal excimer laser angioplasty was performed in 61 patients (40 men and 21 females mean age 66 [41-86] years) with 65 peripheral arterial occlusions (iliac: 11, femoropopliteal: 48, tibial: 5, left subclavian artery: 1). The average ankle-arm index before treatment was 0.45 (0.2-0.8) for iliac, 0.52 (0-0.7) for femoropopliteal and 0.3 (0.1-0.4) for tibial occlusion. Recanalization was successful in 58 occlusions, but additional balloon dilatation was necessary in 54. The mean residual stenosis degree after laser application was 54%, after balloon dilatation 22%. Postangioplasty thromboembolism occurred in five patients. Intravascular stents were implanted in 11 patients because of extensive dissection or high-grade restenosis. After four weeks the clinical findings were improved in 54 of the 58 patients, in 47 even after six months. At that point the average ankle-arm index was 0.88 (0.5-1.1) after iliac, 0.79 (0.6-1.15) after femoropopliteal and 0.6 (0.4-0.7) after tibial recanalization.
