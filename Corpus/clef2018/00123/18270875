Long-term follow-up of Symphony nitinol stents in iliac arteriosclerosis obliterans. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term results of iliac artery stent placement with use of the symphony stent for the treatment of patients with intermittent claudication. In a prospective study, 31 cases of iliac occlusive arterial disease were treated in 26 patients. Stenoses (n = 27) were treated after failed angioplasty, and occlusions (n = 4) were treated with primary stent placement. Clinical history, clinical stage and the ankle brachial-index (ABI) examination measurement were assessed. The patients were followed up with clinical examination, ABI examination measurement and intravenous angiography. The follow-up period ranged between 9.5 months and 7.5 years (median = 5.9 yr). Data were analyzed using the univariate analysis (Kaplan-Meier method). The mean+/-SD ABI pre-, post-procedure and in the last control was 0.70+/-0.17, 0.97+/-0.15, and 0.96+/-0.20, respectively. Primary patency rates (%) +/- SE were 83+/-7 after 3 years, 75+/-8 after five years, and 67+/-9 after seven years, and secondary patency rates were 93+/-5 after three years, 86+/-7 after five years, and 86+/-7 after seven years. During the first 24 hours, one patient presented occlusion of the treated segment. During follow-up, 9 (29%) patients were admitted to our hospital because of worsening of the symptoms. In this study, the symphony stent has been proven to be a good device to treat lesions in the iliac region but more experience is needed to optimize endovascular treatment in this area. In our experience the treatment of iliac artery occlusive disease with symphony stents can be considered a good option with acceptable patency rates and low morbidity and mortality.
