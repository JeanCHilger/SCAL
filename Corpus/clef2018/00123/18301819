Use of magnetic resonance angiography in diagnosis and decision making of post-traumatic, high-flow priapism. The ideal imaging modality should demonstrate the presence or absence of a clinically significant causative vascular lesion which, in high-flow arterial priapism, may need intervention. We report a 22-year-old male with post-traumatic arterial priapism. Doppler US could not reliably identify a significant vascular lesion. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) demonstrated the presence of cavernous artery pseudoaneurysm. Based on this finding, embolization was decided with a successful outcome. Contrast enhanced The ideal imaging modality should demonstrate the presence or absence of a clinically significant, causative vascular lesion that, in high-flow arterial priapism, may need intervention. We report a 22-year-old male with post-traumatic arterial priapism. Color Doppler ultrasound could not reliably identify a significant vascular lesion. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) demonstrated the presence of a cavernous artery pseudoaneurysm. Based on this finding, embolization was decided, with a successful outcome. Contrast-enhanced MRA appears to be a useful, noninvasive diagnostic tool for decision making in cases of high-flow priapism.
