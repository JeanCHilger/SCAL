Measurement of hemodynamic and anatomic parameters in a swine arteriovenous fistula model. Although arteriovenous fistulae (AVFs) are currently the preferred mode of permanent hemodialysis access they do have significant problems due to initial non-maturation and a later venous stenosis. These problems appear to have been exacerbated following a push to increase AVF prevalence in the US. The reasons for both AVF non-maturation and the later venous stenoses are unclear but are thought to be related to abnormal hemodynamic wall shear stress (WSS) profiles. This technical note aims to describe the successful development of measurement techniques that can be used to establish a complete hemodynamic profile in a pig model with two different configurations of AVF.The curved and straight AVF configurations were created in an in vivo pig model. Flow and pressure in the AVFs were measured using the perivascular flow probes and Doppler flow wires while the pressure was recorded using a pressure transducer. The anatomical configuration was obtained using two different approaches: a) combination of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and angiograms, (b) 64 slice CT angiography. 3D models were reconstructed using image processing and computer modeling techniques. Numerical calculations were then performed by applying the measured flow and pressure data into the configurations to obtain the hemodynamic WSS profiles.The described methodologies will allow the calculation and optimization of WSS profiles in animal models. This information could then be translated to the clinical setting where it would have a positive impact on improving the early maturation rates of AVFs as well as reducing the late venous stenoses.
