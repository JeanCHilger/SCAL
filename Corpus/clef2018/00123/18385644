Susceptibility to endothelium-dependent vasoactive agents in patients with coronary artery calcinosis. Coronary artery calcinosis was measured with ECG-gated multislice spiral CT in 68 patients, mean age 57.54+/-1.04 (M+/-m), including 47 men (69.1%) and 21 women (30.9%). Vascular reactivity of microcirculatory bed was assessed with laser Doppler flowmetry after acetylcholine and histamine administration. Coronary artery calcinosis correlated negatively with vascular susceptibility to acetylcholine (r=-0.380, p=0.002). This correlation did not depend on sex, age and concomitant drug therapy. Smoking was shown to affect significantly microvascular reactivity to histamine in persons free from coronary atherosclerosis. History of smoking determined the disturbances of vascular reactivity to histamine in patients with coronary artery calcinosis.
