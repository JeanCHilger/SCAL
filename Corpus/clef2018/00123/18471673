Sub-clinical vascular disease in type 2 diabetic subjects: relationship with chronic complications of diabetes and the presence of cardiovascular disease risk factors. We evaluated the association between a low ankle-brachial index (ABI), chronic complications of diabetes, and the presence of traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors in subjects with type 2 diabetes but without known cardiovascular disease.We included diabetic subjects (n=923 52% maleThe mean duration of diabetes was 9.6 years. Prevalence of a low ABI (<0.9) was 26.2%. Multivariate analysis indicated that factors significantly associated with a low ABI were age (OR: 1.06 95%CI: 1.033-1.084A low ABI is highly prevalent in subjects with diabetes and is related to age, duration of diabetes, smoking habit, and hypertriglyceridemia. Although chronic complications are frequently associated with a low ABI, only renal damage is independently associated with peripheral artery disease.
