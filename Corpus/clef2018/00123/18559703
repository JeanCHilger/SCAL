Results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety of intramuscular injection of hepatocyte growth factor plasmid to improve limb perfusion in patients with critical limb ischemia. The Study to Assess the Safety of Intramuscular Injection of Hepatocyte Growth Factor Plasmid to Improve Limb Perfusion in Patients With Critical Limb Ischemia (HGF-STAT trial) determined the effect of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) plasmid on safety and limb tissue perfusion as measured by transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPo(2)) in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI).Randomized patients with rest pain or ischemic ulcers and TcPo(2) <40 mm Hg and/or toe pressure <50 mm Hg received placebo or HGF-plasmid intramuscular injection as follows: 0.4 mg at days 0, 14, and 28 (low dose) 4.0 mg at days 0 and 28 (middle dose)Intramuscular injection of HGF plasmid was safe and well tolerated. Larger studies to determine whether HGF plasmid can improve wound healing and limb salvage in patients with CLI are warranted.
