Association of insulin resistance and inflammation with peripheral arterial disease: the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999 to 2004. Although the role of inflammation in the pathophysiology of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is well established, the contribution of insulin resistance (IR) to PAD is less clear. We hypothesized that IR is associated with PAD and that the presence of IR would influence the association between C-reactive protein (CRP) and PAD, an association established predominantly in healthy individuals.We analyzed data from 3242 adults in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999 to 2004 who underwent measurement of ankle brachial index, CRP, and fasting glucose and insulin, enabling calculation of homeostasis model of IR (HOMA-IR). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were estimated by logistic regression. The mean prevalence of PAD (defined as an ankle brachial index </=0.9) was 5.5% (SE, 0.47%). HOMA-IR was independently associated with PAD (OR, 2.06 95% CI, 1.1 to 4.0These findings demonstrate that IR is strongly and independently associated with PAD. Furthermore, IR modifies the association of inflammation with PAD. These data establish a role of IR in PAD and highlight the relative importance of inflammation in patients with and without IR.
