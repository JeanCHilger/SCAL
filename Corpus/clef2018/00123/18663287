Relationship between serum pre-B cell colony-enhancing factor/visfatin and atherosclerotic parameters in chronic hemodialysis patients. Pre-B cell colony-enhancing factor (PBEF)/visfatin is produced by adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, bone marrow, the liver and lymphocytes. Although serum PBEF/visfatin is related to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, and its level is elevated in patients with chronic kidney disease, it remains unclear whether increased PBEF/visfatin is associated with atherosclerotic parameters in hemodialysis (HD) patients. In this study, we measured serum PBEF/visfatin in 68 chronic HD patients (age 66 +/- 14 years, time on HD 76 +/- 76 months, 41 males, 27 females) and examined the association of serum PBEF/visfatin with serum asymmetric dimethylarginine, arteriosclerotic parameters such as pulse wave velocity, ankle brachial pressure index and the percent of abdominal aortic wall calcification in a cross-sectional fashion. Serum PBEF/visfatin was significantly correlated with time on HD (r = 0.29, p = 0.02), but not with age, gender and diabetes. There was no association between PBEF/visfatin and body mass index, abdominal visceral and subcutaneous fat mass area, and total adiponectin. Serum PBEF/visfatin was significantly positively correlated with log-transformed highly sensitive C-reactive protein (r = 0.26, p < 0.05) but negatively with serum albumin (r = -0.33, p < 0.01). In contrast, there was no association between serum PBEF/visfatin and asymmetric dimethylarginine, aortic pulse wave velocity, brachial ankle pressure index and percent of abdominal aortic wall calcification. It follows from these findings that serum PBEF/visfatin may reflect the inflammatory status rather than atherosclerotic changes in chronic HD patients.
