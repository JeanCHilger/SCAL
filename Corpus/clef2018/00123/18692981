The association between elevated ankle systolic pressures and peripheral occlusive arterial disease in diabetic and nondiabetic subjects. The presence of a high ankle-brachial index (ABI) is related to stiff ankle arteries due to medial calcification. Recently, this condition has attracted new interest after reports of a worse cardiovascular prognosis, similar to a low ABI. We sought to compare risk factors contributing to a low (< or =0.90) and high (> or =1.40) ABI. Additionally, we hypothesized that in instances of high ABI, occlusive PAD may coexist.This cross-sectional study was conducted at vascular laboratories in a university medical center. The subjects were 510 ambulatory patients (37% had diabetes) previously examined at our vascular laboratories and who responded positively to our invitation. We collected data on smoking, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease history. The noninvasive assessment of lower limb arteries consisted of the measurement of ABI, toe-brachial index (TBI), and posterior tibial artery peak flow velocity (Pk-PT). A TBI >0.7 and a Pk-PT >10 cm/s were considered normal.High- and low-ABI were detected, respectively, in 2.1% and 57.8% of limbs. For a low ABI, age (odds ratio [OR], 1.29/10 y), pack-years (OR, 1.08/10 units), and hypertension (OR, 1.90) were independent significant (P < .001) factors. A strong association was found between diabetes and high ABI (OR, 16.0 P < .001). When ABI ranges were compared with TBI and Pk-PT results, those with ABI < or =0.90 and ABI > or =1.40 presented similar patterns of abnormalities. Pk-PT or TBI, or both, was abnormal in more than 80% of cases in both ABI < or =0.90 and > or =1.40 groups. The ABI vs TBI relationship appeared linear in nondiabetic patients, but had an inverted J-shape in diabetic patients, suggesting high ABI masked leg ischemia.Diabetes is the dominant risk factor for a high (> or =1.40) ABI. Occlusive PAD is highly prevalent in subjects with high ABI, and these subjects should be considered as PAD-equivalent.
