Acute and long-term outcome of endovascular therapy for aortoiliac occlusive lesions stratified according to the TASC classification: a single-center experience. To compare acute and long-term outcomes of endovascular therapy for TASC (TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus) A and B lesions versus TASC C and D lesions.Based on a prospectively maintained database, a retrospective analysis was conducted of 375 symptomatic patients (335 men mean age 63+/-8 years) who underwent 438 interventions for aortoiliac arterial obstructions. Lesions were stratified according to the TASC II classification: 259 (59%) procedures involved TASC A/B lesions, while 113 (26%) were for TASC C and 66 (15%) for TASC D lesions.The baseline characteristics of patients with TASC A/B lesions differed significantly in the ankle-brachial index (ABI), occurrence of renal insufficiency, and lesion characteristics from those with TASC C or D lesions. Acute treatment success, defined as residual stenosis <30%, was 100%, 96%, 93%, and 100% for TASC A, B, C, and D lesions, respectively. The primary 1-year patency rate, which was 86% for the entire study cohort, was similar for all TASC classifications (89%, 86%, 86%, 85% for TASC A to D lesions, respectively). In the TASC A/B cohort, the 5-year event-free survival (70%) was not significantly better than in the C/D cohort (57%, p=0.124). The clinical outcome, as measured by Rutherford stage and ABI, improved significantly in all TASC subgroups after successful intervention and was maintained up to 1 year. Stenting was an independent predictor for lower restenosis rates (HR 0.517, 95% CI 0.317 to 0.842 p=0.008).In experienced hands, endovascular therapy of aortoiliac lesions can be successfully performed with sustained long-term outcome independent of the TASC II classification, even in class D lesions.
