Non-invasive diagnosis of lesions of peripheral blood vessels in patients with diabetes mellitus. Clinical examination of 51 diabetes mellitus patients with the disease running a severe, moderate and light course included ultrasound dopplerography to measure arterial and venous pressure on the malleolus and photoplethysmography to evaluate arterial pressure in the great toe. There appeared a relationship between the disease severity and venous pressure, toe pressure index, pressure gradient malleolus--toe. The closest correlation was with the venous pressure. At late stages of diabetic angiopathy calcinosis of the arterial wall distorts real value of malleolar systolic pressure necessitating multimodality investigation of peripheral vessels in diabetic patients.
