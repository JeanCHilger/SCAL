Differences in vitamin D status as a possible contributor to the racial disparity in peripheral arterial disease. Racial differences in cardiovascular risk factors do not fully explain the higher prevalence of lower-extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in black adults.We sought to determine whether any of this excess risk may be explained by vitamin D status, which has been widely documented to be lower in blacks than in whites.This population-based cross-sectional study included 2987 white and 866 black persons aged >or=40 y from the 2001-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. PAD was defined as an ankle-brachial pressure index of <0.90 in either leg.Mean (+/-SEM) 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations were significantly lower in black than in white adults (39.2 +/- 1.0 and 63.7 +/- 1.1 nmol/L, respectively P < 0.001). Adjusted odds ratios for PAD decreased in a dose-dependent fashion with increasing quartiles of 25(OH)D in white adults [1.00 (referent), 0.86, 0.67, and 0.53Racial differences in vitamin D status may explain nearly one-third of the excess risk of PAD in black compared with white adults. Additional research is needed to confirm these findings.
