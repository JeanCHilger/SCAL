The metabolic syndrome and its traits as risk factors for subclinical atherosclerosis. The metabolic syndrome (MetS) indicates an increased cardiovascular risk. The objective of the present study was to determine the impact of the MetS and its individual traits on subclinical atherosclerosis, as measured with six noninvasive measurements of atherosclerosis (NIMA) in a 50- to 70-yr-old Dutch population-based cohort. Furthermore, we determined the impact of three different definitions of the MetS.We performed NIMA in 1517 participants of the Nijmegen Biomedical Study. The MetS was defined by definitions of the National Cholesterol Education Program, International Diabetes Federation, and the World Health Organization.Participants with the MetS (National Cholesterol Education Program) were characterized by increased subclinical atherosclerosis compared with participants without any trait of the MetS, as reflected by lower ankle-brachial index at rest [percent change (95% confidence interval), M: -5.2% (-9 -1), F: -3.1% (-6For cardiovascular risk prediction, it is more important to take into account the presence of each individual trait and the number of traits of the MetS than to diagnose the presence of the MetS.
