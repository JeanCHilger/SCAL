Thrombolysis with rt-PA in children with arterial and venous thromboses--a new therapy concept. Thrombolytic therapy usually used for thrombosis in the adult has been administered as a therapeutic regiment in pediatric patients (parental consent was sought prior to the treatment with rt-PA). We report our experience with rt-PA in 17 children and adolescents suffering from arterial (n = 4) or venous thrombosis (n = 13) due to local rhabdomyosarcoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic myeloblastosis, sickle cell anaemia, parenteral nutrition, haemolytic uremic syndrome, central arterial and venous catheters and septicemia Thrombotic diseases have been diagnosed by Doppler ultrasound, computed tomography, angiography and phlebography. Rt-PA therapy was started immediately after diagnostic procedures had been performed. Rt-PA dose varied from 0.2 mg as a single dose to 0.8 mg/kg bw/d over a three day period in children local thrombolysis was performed. In patients requiring systemic thrombolytic therapy rt-PA was administered from 0.8 mg/kg bw/d in three days to 2.0 mg/kg bw/d over a whole period of three weeks in both groups during thrombolysis low dose heparin was added. When rt-PA infusion was terminated heparin (70 IU - 400 IU/kg bw/d) was administered for 7 to 14 days in order to prevent reocclusion. Later prophylaxis with coumarin derivatives in venous thrombosis and antiplatelet agents in arterial occlusive diseases was performed. In no patient did we see a decrease of fibrinogen and plasminogen during rt-PA therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
