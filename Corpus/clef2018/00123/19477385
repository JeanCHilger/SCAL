Clinical outcomes after percutaneous peripheral intervention for chronic total occlusion of superficial femoral arteries: comparison between self-expandable nitinol stent and stainless steel stent. It has been reported that nitinol stents provide higher patency in chronic phase than stainless steel stents after intervention to superficial femoral artery (SFA). However, there are few reports about stent patency for chronic total occlusion of SFA (SFA CTO).To compare clinical outcomes of self-expanding nitinol stents and stainless steel stents after percutaneous peripheral intervention (PPI) for SFA CTO.Between April 2004 and August 2007, a total of 25 SFA CTO lesions (nitinol stent group, 13 stainless steel stent group, 12) in 21 patients were treated with PPI, all patients were followed clinically, and 21 lesions (nitinol, 9Our study demonstrates the superiority of nitinol stent implantation compared with stainless steel stent implantation for SFA CTO.
