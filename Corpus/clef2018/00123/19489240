The relationship between peripheral arterial disease and coronary artery disease and stroke in arterial sclerosis. The purpose of the study was to investigate the relationship between peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and coronary artery disease or stroke in Chinese. At the same time, investigate the prevalence of symptoms, include cold, numb, pain, intermittent claudication and ulcer, then investigate the relationship between abnormal ABI and them.Hospitalized patients in department of cardiology, neurology and vascular were enrolled from March 2006 to December 2007 consecutively. ABI was measured and the disease history was collected. Elective Fraction (EF), cardioangiography of coronary artery, and ultrasound examination of cervical artery were recorded too to analyze the relationship between them and ABI. The degree of cold, numb, pain, intermittent claudication and ulcer were recorded in patients with PAD, to analyze the relationship between the prevalence and ABI.In 132 patients of department of cardiology, the prevalence of ABI < 0.9 was 29.5%, In 124 patients of department of neurology, the prevalence of ABI < 0.9 was 17.7%. When ABI decreased, the EF decreased too, and the disease of coronary artery and cervical artery became more serious. In patients of vascular department, when ABI decreased, the symptoms of cold, numb, pain, intermittent claudication and ulcer aggravated.In Chinese, in patients with coronary artery disease, the prevalence of PAD is 29.5%, and in patients with stroke the prevalence of PAD is 17.7%. 7.2% patients have these three disease. PAD has relationship with the severity of these two diseases. In patients with PAD, the symptoms will aggravate when ABI decreased. When ABI < 0.4, the symptoms all aggravate significantly.
