Should we hesitate to use subcutaneous tunneling for fear of damaging the sural flap pedicle? The distally based sural nerve flap is a preferable option for covering defects of the lower third of the leg. However, many authors noted that in particular pressure exerted by tunneling of the flap pedicle could be harmful. Thus, they either inset the pedicle or exteriorize the pedicle to decrease complications.We used distally based superficial sural artery island flaps for the reconstruction of defects of the lower leg, the ankle, and malleolus in 12 patients between 2004 and 2008 without tunelization. The defects were covered with no major complications.In 3 flaps, there was a small amount of distal marginal necrosis, which was excised and closed spontaneously or skin grafted.We concluded that unless there are certain risk factors such as arterial hypertension, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and vasculitis, avoiding a subcutaneous tunneling is not necessary.
