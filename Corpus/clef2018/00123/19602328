Treatment of hypertension in patients with peripheral arterial disease: an update. Hypertension is a known risk factor for cardiovascular events, and recent data have pointed to peripheral arterial disease (PAD) as another strong risk factor together, they cause a surprisingly high total risk. This review deals with the clinical management of this dangerous association. The ankle-brachial index helps in the diagnosis of PAD and the estimation of risk. To control risk, lifestyle adaptation is essential. There is no consensus on a first choice of antihypertensive drug. Arguments favor angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, but most patients require several antihypertensive drugs to reach goal pressure (140/90 mm Hg or lower). Moreover, to control the risk of PAD, antiplatelet drugs, antihypertensive drugs, and statins are recommended.
