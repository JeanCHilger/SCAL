Nitinol stent implantation in long superficial femoral artery lesions: 12-month results of the DURABILITY I study. To evaluate the long-term efficacy and integrity of the PROTEGE EverFlex stent in superficial femoral artery (SFA) lesions in symptomatic patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD).A prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized study enrolled 151 subjects (111 men mean age 67.8 years, range 42-93) undergoing percutaneous treatment of de novo, restenotic, or reoccluded SFA lesions between August 11, 2006, and June 26, 2007. Subjects were scheduled to receive a single stent and be evaluated through 12 months following the implant procedure. Occlusions were present in 40% of the patients. Mean lesion length was 96.4 mm (range 10-150).A total of 161 stents (158 EverFlex) were implanted in the 151 patients: single stents in 93.4% (141/151) and a second stent in 6.6% (10/151). One-year follow-up information was available for 88.7% (134/151) of the study participants of the remaining 17 subjects, 6 subjects withdrew from the study, 2 were lost to follow-up, and 9 died. Freedom from restenosis data were available for 99.3% (133/134) of the subjects who completed a 12-month follow-up visit. The mean Rutherford classification fell from 2.8+/-0.8 (range 1-5) at baseline to 0.6+/-1.1 (range 0-5) at 12 months. The mean ankle-brachial index rose from 0.6+/-0.2 (range 0-1.4) at baseline to 0.9+/-0.2 (range 0-1.2) at 12 months. The rates for freedom from >50% restenosis at 6 and 12 months were 91.3% (95% CI 84.9% to 95.2%) and 72.2% (95% CI 63.8% to 79.6%), respectively. The freedom from target lesion revascularization rate at 12 months was 79.1% (95% CI 71.2% to 85.6%). The 1-year stent fracture rate was 8.1% (95% CI 4.0% to 14.4%).The high freedom from >50% restenosis and low fracture rate at 12 months suggests that the PROTEGE EverFlex stent offers a safe and acceptably efficacious means of treating SFA lesions in symptomatic subjects with PAD.
