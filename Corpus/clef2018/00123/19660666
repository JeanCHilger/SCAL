Progress in restoration of hearing with the auditory brainstem implant. Fifty years ago auditory scientists were very skeptical about the potential of new prosthetic approaches that electrically stimulated the auditory nerve, the cochlear nuclei (CN), and the inferior colliculus (IC). In those decades, the basilar membrane was considered to play a fundamental and irreplaceable role as a fine spectrum analyzer in hearing physiology, and therefore it was thought that electrical stimulation of the auditory system would have never produced functionally useful hearing. Over the last 30 years, cochlear implants (CIs) have improved steadily to the point where the average sentence recognition with modern multichannel devices is better than 90% correct. More recently, similar performance has been observed with electric stimulation of the brainstem with auditory brainstem implants (ABIs). However, it is clear that to fully understand hearing and to design the next generation of prosthetic devices we must better understand the ear-brain relationship. Indeed some aspects of hearing do not require the intricate complexities of cochlear physiological responses, while other auditory tasks rely critically on specialized details of cochlear processing. The progress in electrical stimulation of the central auditory system requires us to reconsider the patient selection criteria for different implant devices, in particular to evaluate the possibility of ABIs for etiologies with poor outcomes with CIs. In the present review, the latest outcomes in restoration of hearing with ABI are presented. New guidelines are proposed for device selection for different etiologies and future research is suggested to further refine the process of matching an individual patient to the most appropriate implant device.
