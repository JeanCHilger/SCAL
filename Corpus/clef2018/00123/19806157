Microvascular dysfunction: a direct link among BMI, waist circumference and glucose homeostasis in young overweight/obese normoglycemic women? Capillary recruitment is impaired in obesity (OB), possibly worsening glucose and insulin availability to target organs. In this study, we investigated whether functional microvascular parameters were correlated with clinical-anthropometrical data and whether these parameters would influence OB-related metabolic disorders, especially glucose homeostasis, in young overweight (OW)/obese women.Cross-sectional clinical study of microvascular reactivity in young OW/obese women.A total of 10 lean (23.1 + or - 3.2 years, body mass index (BMI) 22.3 + or - 1.6 kg m(-2)) and 42 OW/obese (24.9 + or - 3.5 years BMI 34.5 + or - 5.7 (25.7-46.5) kg m(-2)) sedentary non-smoking women were evaluated. Lipid profile, fasting plasma glucose (PG), post-load PG (75 g-2 h), insulin, C-reactive protein, HOMA-IR (homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance) index and anthropometric variables (weight, BMI, waist and hip circumferences, waist-to-hip ratio and blood pressure (BP)) were determined. Functional microvascular parameters (functional capillary density, red blood cell velocity at baseline and peak (RBCV(max)), and time taken to reach RBCV(max) (TRBCV(max)) during post-occlusive reactive hyperemia after 1 min arterial occlusion) were evaluated by nailfold videocapillaroscopy.The time taken to reach RBCV(max) was significantly longer in OW/obese patients compared with control subjects (8.6 + or - 2.4 versus 5.7 + or - 1.1 s, P<0.001), and its delay was directly associated with adiposity levels, systolic BP and insulin resistance, and inversely related to high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol. Post-load PG could be correlated with TRBCV(max) (R = 0.48, P<0.05) and RBCV(max) (R = -0.29, P<0.05), and it was influenced by weight, waist circumference and TRBCV(max) (adjusted R(2) = 24%) as well.In the investigated group of young OW/obese women, the direct correlation between post-load PG and TRBCV(max) links microvascular parameters with metabolic variables and suggests a key role for microcirculation in OB-related metabolic disorders.
