Patient-based outcomes using the Walking Impairment Questionnaire for patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease treated with Lipo-PGE1. Patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAD) experience deteriorating ambulatory function and consequently impaired quality of life (QOL). QOL in patients receiving prostaglandin E(1) in lipid microspheres (lipo-PGE(1) Liple) for the treatment of PAD has not been evaluated using the Japanese version of the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ).Data from 169 patients (98 men, 71 women mean [median] age, 74+/-10 [74] years) with an ankle-brachial pressure index <0.9 were analyzed. WIQ scores and symptom scores significantly improved after lipo-PGE(1) treatment (P<0.01). Physicians' assessments of global improvement significantly correlated with all 4 WIQ subscales (R< or =0.31).WIQ is a valid tool for evaluating therapeutic response in patients with PAD. Lipo-PGE(1) improves QOL as evaluated by patients themselves.
