An instantaneous blood pressure measuring system at the wrist based on the volume-compensation method. An instantaneous blood pressure measuring system at the wrist based on the volume-compensation method is developed, and the characteristics and accuracy of the system is evaluated. The radial artery at the wrist is used as the detecting object, and a pad-type cuff as well as a newly designed electro- pneumatic converter is used in the system. Also, the comparative experiments between the system and the invasive blood measuring device (direct method) indicated that, the results obtained from the two methods are well correlated not only in rest condition, but also in a stressful condition. Therefore, the system is capable of non-invasive measuring instantaneous blood pressure in the radial artery.
