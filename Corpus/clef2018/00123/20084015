An optimized mouse model for transient ischemic attack. Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) are brief neurological deficits ofcerebrovascular origin that are followed by complete clinical recovery. Although a plethora of animal models exist for ischemic stroke, a verified TIA model is lacking. We aimed to optimize such a model in mice, investigating the impact of varying durations (from 2.5 to 20 minutes) of intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). Three conditions were required to mimic clinical TIA reliably: 1) an objective demonstration of occlusion and reperfusion (assessed by laser Doppler flowmetry) 2) no permanent neurological deficit (assessed by sensorimotor neurological evaluation)
