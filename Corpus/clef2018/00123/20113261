Evaluation of skin microcirculation during hemodialysis. Cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients remains high despite improvements in HD technique such as dialysis adequacy, dialysis fluid purity, and membrane biocompatibility. Optimal fluid balance to maintain optimal hemodynamic stability during hemodialysis (HD) procedure is essential. At the present time, hemodynamic stability is conventionally assessed as stability of macrocirculation, especially as maintenance of systemic blood pressure with no attention paid to peripheral perfusion. Peripheral ischemic vascular disease represents a serious problem with high mortality and morbidity. We estimated skin microcirculation changes during HD using new device, Laser Doppler Line Scanner (Moor Instruments, Devon, UK).The aims were to introduce the novel method of detection of skin perfusion changes during hemodialysis and to evaluate possible relationship of these to ultrafiltration as well as to selected biochemical characteristics.In 36 hemodynamically stable patients, we performed paired measurements of skin blood flow in both hands before and during HD with registering the time of dialysis and the total ultrafiltration achieved.We found a significant decrease in a majority of the evaluated areas. However, the skin blood flow change was not homogenous as it decreased more on the fingers.To our knowledge, this is the first study when the microcirculatory changes during hemodialysis are demonstrated and evaluated in large skin surface area, and showing not only a decrease in a majority of areas but also the heterogeneity of the changes.
