Comparison of efficacy of antiplatelet treatments for patients with claudication. A meta-analysis. It was the aim of the present study to investigate if antiplatelet treatment reduced cardiovascular events in patients with claudication and/or an ankle/brachial index (ABI)< or =0.99 and to analyse if specific antiplatelet treatment had a different impact on clinical outcome. We performed a meta-analysis of 29 clinical randomized trials on antiplatelet therapy for prevention of vascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke in 10,735 peripheral artery disease patients. The primary end-point utilizing in the meta-analysis construction was Cardiovascular Adverse Event. We found 1,900 (17.70%) patients in trials with aspirin, 5,326 (49.61%) in those with thienopyridines, 2,324 (21.65%) in those with picotamide and 1,185 (11.04 %) in those with others antiplatelet drugs. A statistically significant effect of antiplatelet treatment [odds ratio (OR) 0.839 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.729-0.965
