A novel approach to evaluate the vessel function determined by near infrared spectroscopy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate arterial function by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). 16 elderly subjects were studied: 8 were arteriosclerosis obliterans patients (ASO), and 8 were healthy elderly (non-ASO). A cuff around the thigh was inflated to a pressure of 20% above their ankle systolic blood pressure for 3 min. The NIRS probe was positioned over the gatrocnemius muscle to measure oxygenated hemoglobin (O(2)Hb), and the recovery time and rate for DeltaO(2)Hb after occlusion were calculated. Compared with the non-ASO group, the ASO group had a longer recovery time (p < 0.05) and a shallower recovery rate gradient (p < 0.01). The ankle to brachial index was correlated with recovery time (r = -0.61, p < 0.01) and recovery rate (r = 0.80, p < 0.001). These data suggest that NIRS may provide an effective non-invasive method for evaluating arterial function in patients with arteriosclerosis obliterans.
