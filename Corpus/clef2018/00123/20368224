Plasma monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 as risk marker in type 2 diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease in North Indians. The chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is implicated in chronic inflammation, insulin resistance and atherosclerosis. The present study was designed to explore the relation of plasma levels of MCP-1 to disease pathology in type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease (CAD) patients. Fasting plasma venous samples were taken from 162 subjects divided into four groups: Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and CAD (n=41), type 2 diabetes patients without CAD (n=50), CAD patients with no history of diabetes (n=41) and healthy controls (n=30). Coronary risk factors such as body mass index, percentage body fat, waist/hip ratio, blood pressure and physical activity were measured using standard procedures. Plasma MCP-1 was quantitatively estimated by sandwich enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). Significant differences were observed for MCP-1 levels, percent body fat, body mass index, waist/hip ratio, systolic and diastolic blood pressure amongst the groups. MCP-1 concentration was significantly correlated with diabetes duration (p<0.001), body mass index (p<0.01), waist/hip ratio (p<0.01), systolic blood pressure (p<0.01), percentage body fat (p<0.01) and physical activity level (p<0.001). MCP-1 might serve as a marker for CAD, and its association with CAD is mainly driven by traditional coronary risk factors.
