Intima-media thickness of common carotid and brachial arteries and prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 are associated with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in patients with myocardial infarction. To investigate the association between intima-media thickness of brachial and common carotid arteries and factors of the coagulation- and fibrinolysis-system with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in patients with a previous myocardial infarction.One hundred and twenty three patients, men (76%) and women (24%) aged between 32 and 81 years with a history of previous acute myocardial infarction were included. B-mode ultrasound of common carotid and brachial arteries and echocardiography with tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) were evaluated. Factors of the coagulation- and fibrinolysis-system were also measured.In patients with previous myocardial infarction, late diastolic filling time was significantly and positively associated with log Prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (P < 0.001) and with calculated intima-media area (cIMa) of the both common carotid and brachial arteries (P < 0.05). Mitral early-to-late flow velocity ratio (E/A) was significantly and negatively associated with log Prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (P < 0.001), total cholesterol and cIMa of the both common carotid and brachial arteries (P < 0.05). Moreover both late diastolic filling time and mitral E/A correlated significantly with age and systolic blood pressure. In stepwise multiple regression analysis, log Prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 remained the only variable with independent significant correlation to late diastolic filling time and mitral E/A.In a population sample of patients with myocardial infarction, late diastolic filling time and mitral E/A were associated with cIMa of common carotid and brachial arteries, systolic blood pressure, and prothrombin fragment 1 + 2, suggesting a relationship between diastolic dysfunction, thrombin generation and atherosclerosis.
