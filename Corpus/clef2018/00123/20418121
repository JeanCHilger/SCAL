Quality of life among lower extremity peripheral arterial disease patients who have undergone endovascular or surgical revascularization: a case-control study. To assess the quality of life (QoL) of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) patients who have undergone either percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) only and/or one or more surgical revascularizations.A postal questionnaire study in which a case-control methodology was applied.131 patients with PTAs (mean age 70.7, SD 10.4 yrs range 39-89, 58% men) and 100 with surgical revascularizations (mean age 67.8, SD 10.4 yrsPatients after endovascular and/or surgical revascularization (most with ABIs 0.5-0.89 and without cognitive impairment), had similarly lower QoL, GDS and LS indicated more depression than their controls.Poor QoL and depression should be thoroughly considered, alongside proper follow-up and ABI-measurements.
