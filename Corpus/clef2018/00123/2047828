Sources of error in the diagnosis and therapy of hypertension. Possible errors in the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension are discussed. The problems of blood pressure determinations are reviewed by comparing the results of sphygmomanometry in the doctor's office, of automated ambulatory blood pressure recording and of blood pressure self-measurement. In screening for renovascular hypertension one should be aware that no test is yet available which shows adequate sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, the only investigation that should be used to demonstrate a true stenosis is arteriography. When treating hypertensives it must be kept in mind that the benefits of antihypertensive medication, i.e. reducing morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease, should exceed the costs and side effects of the treatment. Finally, the effects of reduction in dose and discontinuation of antihypertensive medication are discussed.
