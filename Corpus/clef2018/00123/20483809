Extracranial carotid stenosis and peripheral arterial disease in Thai patients with coronary artery disease. We assessed the prevalence of carotid stenosis (CS) and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) to determine the relationship between these conditions in a Thai population. All patients with coronary angiography during June 2008 and August 2009 were studied. Carotid duplex and ankle-brachial index (ABI) were performed. One hundred and seventy-seven patients were studied (95 men, mean age of 65). Carotid stenosis and PAD were diagnosed in 16 patients (9%) and 68 patients (38.4%), respectively. The presence of carotid bruit and older age were independent predictors of CS and PAD, respectively. There was no correlation between the presence of CS/PAD and the extent of coronary artery lesions. Although CS was uncommon in patients with CAD, the patients with cervical bruit should be screened for CS. Prevalence of PAD was high, confirming the presence of diffuse atherosclerosis in many patients with CAD.
