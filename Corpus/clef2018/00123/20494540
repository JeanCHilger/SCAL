External iliac artery dissection secondary to endofibrosis in a cyclist. Endofibrosis of the external iliac artery is an uncommon disease affecting primarily young, otherwise healthy, endurance athletes. Thigh pain during maximal exercise with quick resolution postexercise is characteristic of the so-called cyclist's iliac syndrome. We report an unusual case in which the typical endofibrotic plaque was accompanied by dissection of the external iliac artery. The patient was treated surgically with excision of the affected artery segment and placement of an interposition graft. This case highlights an unusual finding in association with external iliac artery endofibrosis and provides an opportunity to briefly review the literature on the subject.
