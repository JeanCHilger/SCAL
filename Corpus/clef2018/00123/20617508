Correlation between uteroplacental three-dimensional power Doppler indices and true uterine blood flow: evaluation in a pregnant sheep model. Three-dimensional (3D) Doppler quantification within the uteroplacental unit could be of great help in understanding and screening for pre-eclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. Yet the correlation between 3D Doppler indices and true blood flow has not been confirmed in vivo. The aim of this study was to evaluate this correlation in a pregnant sheep model.A blood flow quantitative sensor and a controllable vascular occlusion system were placed around the common uterine artery in seven sheep in late pregnancy, while all the other arterial supplies were ligated. Several occlusion levels were applied, from 0 to 100%, simultaneously with 3D Doppler acquisitions of several placentomes, using standardized settings. Each placentome was analyzed using VOCALâ„¢ (Virtual Organ Computer-aided AnaLysis) software. The correlation between true blood flow and Doppler indices (vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI) and vascularization flow index (VFI)) was evaluated, together with measurement reproducibility.Forty-eight acquisitions were analyzed. All 3D Doppler indices were significantly correlated with true blood flow. Higher correlations were observed for VI and VFI (r = 0.81 (0.74-0.87), P < 0.0001 and r = 0.75 (0.67-0.82), P < 0.0001) compared with FI (r = 0.53 (0.38-0.64) P < 0.0001). Both intra- and interobserver reproducibility were high, with intraclass correlation coefficients of at least 0.799.This is the first in-vivo experimental study confirming a significant correlation between true blood perfusion and quantitative 3D Doppler indices measured within the uteroplacental unit. These results confirm the potential usefulness of 3D Doppler ultrasound for the assessment of placental vascular insufficiency both in clinical cases and in a research setting.
