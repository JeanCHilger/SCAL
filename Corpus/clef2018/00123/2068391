An operative case of solitary interruption of the aortic arch in adult. A 43-year-old lady was hospitalized due to easy fatiguability in the legs during exercise, and for evaluation of an abnormal shadow in the chest X-ray, and hypertension. Her blood pressure was 200/80 mmHg in the right arm, 140/70 mmHg in the left, and 110/70 mmHg in both lower extremities. Systolic vascular bruit radiating to her neck and back was audible in the Erb's area. DSA and aortogram disclosed extremely dilated vessels around the origin of the left common carotid artery. The left subclavian artery was opacified retrogradely as a subclavian blood steal via the left vertebral artery, and mild stenosis was seen at its origin. There was no evidence of associated congenital anomaly such as VSD, PDA, or ASD. The final diagnosis, solitary interruption of the aortic arch (S-IAA, type B), was made by MRI. The patient had an extra-anatomical bypass operation by using Cooley woven dacron graft from the ascending to the abdominal aorta. The result was good. S-IAA is a very rare congenital anomaly. As far as we know, only 21 patients with S-IAA including this case have been reported. A physician should be aware that a patient with S-IAA tends to have a difference of blood pressure not only between the upper and lower extremities but also between both arms, and pressure in the right arm is usually higher than that in the left. These are good signs to suspect S-IAA. And they also can be helpful to differentiate S-IAA from coarctation of the aorta.
