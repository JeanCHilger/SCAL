Use of laser Doppler flowmetry to determine blood flow in and viability of island axial pattern skin flaps in rabbits. Perfusion and viability of island axial pattern skin flaps were tested in 37 healthy New Zealand white rabbits, using laser Doppler monitoring of blood flow in the capillary loops and the subpapillary plexus of the dermis. Skin flaps, selected on the basis of the caudal superficial epigastric vein and artery, were lifted and replaced in their original locus after selective occlusion of their vascular pedicles. Subjects were allotted into groups: control group (n = 10) arterial occlusion (n = 7)
