Polymorphisms of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 gene and peripheral artery disease. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) is a key regulator of angiogenesis and is involved in inflammation, which are two important features of the pathogenesis of peripheral artery disease (PAD). The gene for the HIF1-alpha subunit (HIF1A) carries two common mis-sense mutations, P582S (C>T, rs11549465) and A588T (G>A, rs11549467), which both have been related to increased trans-activation capacity of HIF1-alpha. The aim of the present study was to analyze the role of these polymorphisms in PAD. The study was designed as a case-control study including 917 patients with documented PAD and 969 control subjects. HIF1A genotypes were determined by exonuclease (TaqMan) assays. HIF1A P582S genotype frequencies were not significantly different between PAD patients (PP 82.2% PS 16.5%
