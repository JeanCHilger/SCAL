Plasma fibroblast growth factor-23 levels are independently associated with carotid artery atherosclerosis in maintenance hemodialysis patients. Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) has been suggested to play a role in vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease. Common carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT) assessment and common carotid artery (CCA) plaque identification using ultrasound are well-recognized tools for identification and monitoring of atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to test that elevated FGF-23 levels might be associated with carotid artery atherosclerosis in maintenance hemodialysis (HD) patients. In this cross-sectional study, plasma FGF-23 concentrations were measured using a C-terminal human enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. Carotid artery intima-media thickness was measured and CCA plaques were identified by B-Mode Doppler ultrasound. One hundred twenty-eight maintenance HD patients (65 women and 63 men, mean age: 55.5 ± 13 years, mean HD vintage: 52 ± 10 months, all patients are on HD thrice a week) were involved. The mean CIMT were higher with increasing tertiles of plasma FGF-23 levels (0.66 ± 0.14 vs. 0.75 ± 0.05 vs. 0.86 ± 0.20 mm, P<0.0001). Log plasma FGF-23 were higher in patients with plaques in CCA than patients free of plaques (3.0 ± 0.17 vs. 2.7 ± 0.23, P<0.0001). Significant correlation was recorded between log plasma FGF-23 and CIMT (r=0,497, P=0.0001). In multiple regression analysis, a high log FGF-23 concentration was a significant independent risk factor of an increased CIMT. Further studies are needed to clarify whether an increased plasma FGF-23 level is a marker or a potential mechanism for atherosclerosis in patients with end-stage renal disease.
