Ultrasound evaluation of extracranial carotid artery lesions in Parkinsonian patients. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the atherosclerotic changes in patients with vascular parkinsonism and in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease, in order to evaluate the possible influence of the extracranial pathology of carotid arteries in developing lacunar cerebral infarcts. Degree of stenosis and plaque morphology of the extracranial part of carotids in both group of patients were evaluated by color Doppler flow imaging ultrasound investigation and the results were compared. We selected two matched groups of patients with parkinsonism: 22 patients with vascular parkinsonism, and 28 with idiopathic Parkinson's disease.The atherosclerotic changes found in patients with Parkinson's disease showed mild carotid lesions with mostly stable calcified plaques and lesser risk for embolic cerebral intravascular events contrary to the higher degree of carotid stenosis found in patients with vascular parkinsonism with mostly mixed plaques prone to embolization. Therefore, we suggest performing ultrasonographic examination of the extracranial part of carotid arteries in all patients with parkinsonism to assess risk of vascular accidents originating from carotid lesions. That would enable adequate treatment of parkinsonism and prevent further occurrence of intracranial vascular changes.
