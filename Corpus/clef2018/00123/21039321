Abdominal aortic aneurysm detection by common femoral artery Doppler ultrasound waveform analysis. The aim of this research was to determine the effects of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) on blood flow patterns in the common femoral artery (CFA) and to determine the feasibility of detecting AAA by analysis of the CFA Doppler waveform. CFA Doppler waveforms were measured from 30 patients with AAA and 30 normal patients without significant atherosclerotic disease. On visual inspection of the CFA waveforms five features were noted, predominantly in the AAA group, as being different from a normal CFA waveform: (1) spectral broadening on the systolic down stroke (2) transient velocity spikes on the systolic down stroke
