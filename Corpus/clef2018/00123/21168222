Is diabetic retinopathy related to subclinical cardiovascular disease? Persons with diabetic retinopathy (DR) have an increased risk of clinical cardiovascular events. This study aimed to determine whether DR is associated with a range of measures of subclinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) in persons without clinical CVD.Population-based, cross-sectional epidemiologic study.Nine hundred twenty-seven persons with diabetes without clinical CVD in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis.Diabetic retinopathy was ascertained from retinal photographs according to modification of the Airlie House Classification system. Vision-threatening DR (VTDR) was defined as severe nonproliferative DR, proliferative DR, or clinically significant macular edema. Subclinical CVD measures were assessed and defined as follows: high coronary artery calcium (CAC) score, defined as CAC score of 400 or more low ankle-brachial index (ABI), defined as ABI of less than 0.9Associations between DR and subclinical CVD measures.The prevalence of DR and VTDR in this sample was 30.0% and 7.2%, respectively, and VTDR was associated with a high CAC score (odds ratio [OR], 2.33 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-4.73), low ABI (OR, 2.54In persons with diabetes without a history of clinical CVD, the presence of advanced-stage DR is associated with subclinical coronary artery disease. These findings emphasize the need to be careful about the use of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor for the treatment of DR.
