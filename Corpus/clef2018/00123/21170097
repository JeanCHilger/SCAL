Hypertension and peripheral arterial diseases. To explore the relationship between different blood pressure levels and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) assessed by ankle-brachial index (ABI).Data including ABI,blood pressure, health history, medication use, blood biochemistry and physical examinations derived from 15 817 subjects from 9 areas throughout China were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate adjusted Logistic regression analyses were used for the data analyses.Blood pressure levels were classified into 5 levels as normal blood pressure, high normal blood pressure, primary hypertension, secondary hypertension and the third grade of hypertension. With the increasing of blood pressure levels, the risk of PAD gradually increased (Ptrend<0.05). In comparison with normal blood pressure group, the ORs of PAD for the other groups were 1.10 (95%CI: 0.93-1.29), 1.17 (95% CI: 0.97-1.40), 1.91 (95% CI: 1.55-2.37), and 2.64 (95% CI: 1.99-3.49), respectively. After adjusting for gender(only for total population), age, urban/rural, smoke, obesity/overweight, the history of hypercholesterolemia and diabetes, the ORs were 1.11 (95%CI: 0.94-1.32), 1.13 (95% CI: 0.93-1.38), 1.85(95% CI: 1.47-2.33), and 2.66 (95% CI: 1.98-3.57) (Ptrend<0.05).PAD risk increases in proportion with the increasing blood pressure level.
