Doppler ultrasonic diagnosis for deep venous thrombosis of lower limbs. Seventy-one patients with 80 lower limbs clinically suspected of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) were investigated by both Doppler ultrasound and venography. Sixty-seven lower limbs demonstrated by venography to have DVT, in 5 the thrombus was confined to the calf, and all were detected by the Doppler ultrasound. In 62 limbs thrombus extended into the popliteal and more proximal veins, the Doppler ultrasound detected 61 of them, a sensitivity of 98%. Venography showed a deep venous system without any evidence of thrombosis in 13, the Doppler findings were normal in all of the 13 lower limbs, a specificity of 100%. We found that the examination of the popliteal vein with patient in a semi-lateral prone position was important in detecting the presence of thrombosis in popliteal and more proximal vein.
