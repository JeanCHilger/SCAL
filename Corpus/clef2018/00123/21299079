Prevalence and risk factors of peripheral arterial disease in type 2 diabetic patients at HRH Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn Medical Center. To study the prevalence and risk factors of PAD in type 2 diabetes.The crossectional study randomly enrolled 219 diabetic patients to study in Year 2006-2007. All subjects were checked up and recorded basic information and affecting factors to risk of PAD. ABI scores were measured by Colin VP-1000 machine. The affecting factors to PAD risk were analyzed to obtain form descriptive (percent and number) and inferential statistics (odds ratio).There were 219 diabetic patients included in this study with 61.2% of females and 38.8% of males. The prevalence of PAD and intermittent claudication symptoms were 60.3% and 60.7%, respectively. The patients who had current smoking, hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL and HbA1c > or = 7.0% have statistically significant increased risk of PAD odds ratio of 31.89 (95% CI = 4.31-236.0), 5.20 (95% CI = 1.67-16.18), 7.05 (95% CI = 2.29-21.72) and 2.74 (95% CI = 1.07-7.06), respectively, while the groups who had older age (> or = 60 years), duration of DM of > or = 10 years and waist circumference of > or = 90 cm. in men or > or = 80 cm. in women have not statistically significant increased risk of odds ratios of 1.84 (95% CI = 0.77-4.43), 1.11 (95% CI = 0.41-3.04) and 1.69 (95% CI = 0.51-5.6). The patients who had combinations of microvascular complication, previous history of CHD and stroke had significantly statistic risk of odds ratio 8.97 (95% CI = 2.82-28.60) and 5.63 (95% CI = 1.91-16.57) although we needed to measure ABI score in all type 2 diabetes with high risks and CVD.The diabetic patients with high risk and CVD have high prevalence of PAD. Patients with suspected PAD may needs further examination and patients who have increased risk of PAD may require interventions to prevent vascular complications.
