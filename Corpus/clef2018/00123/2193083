The role of oscillometric, oscillographic and rheographic methods in assessing arteriopathy of the legs. The oscillometric method records arterial wall oscillations during pulse wave and index pressure. Sensitivity increases with reactive hyperemia but many artefacts influence his technic. Electronic oscillography is more sensitive but has similar limits and a very high cost. This two methods detect easily arterial occlusive lesions but give only few information about the severity of arterial disease. On the opposite, Irrigraphy (impedance plethysmography) is a functional non invasive technic. Perfected by R. Sarrazin, J. F. Picard and A. Franco, it consists in recording the signal generated by electrical impedances variations related to pulse volume and heart rate. The pulse volume curve is recorded at six different positions of the leg. This method permits the evaluation of collateral vessels. Automatization of this non invasive technic increased reliability, and saves time examination.
