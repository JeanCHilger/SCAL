Eighty-year-old men without cardiovascular disease in the community of Malmö. Part II. Smoking characteristics and ultrasound findings, with special reference to glutathione transferase and pyridoxal-5-phosphate. A total of 1280 80-year-old men in the community of Malmö were questioned about smoking habits and the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). After a careful medical and duplex ultrasound examination, four groups were selected for further studies: (1) no CVD, non-smokers: (2) no CVD, smokers: (3) CVD, smokers: (4) CVD, non-smokers. In total 122 individuals participated. The average tobacco consumption by smokers was 13 g d-1 for 59 years. In the CVD group 45% of subjects had atherosclerotic symptoms at more than one site. Smoking was found to be correlated with lower extremity atherosclerosis, cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were correlated with carotid artery lesions and pathological ankle/arm index, and blood pressure was correlated with lower extremity lesions. In contrast with middle-aged populations, individuals with an increasing degree of lesions in the lower extremities had a larger percentage of high glutathione transferase activity than subjects without CVD. Smokers had significantly lower pyridoxal-5-phosphate levels than non-smokers. It is concluded that some heavy smokers might reach an advanced age in good health. Smoking was also operative as a risk indicator for lower extremity atherosclerosis in 80-year-old individuals.
