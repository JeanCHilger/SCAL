Long-term follow-up after repair of tetralogy of Fallot. One hundred sixty-six patients with tetralogy of Fallot including 15 extreme type-patients repaired since 1971 were analyzed with respect to their physical activities, school or social life, hemodynamics, ECG, reoperation and late mortality. Follow-up period ranged from 1 to 19 years with an average of 9.1. There were 9 late deaths including 4 sudden deaths. Actuarial survival rates at 10 and 19 years were 95.2% and 90.5%, respectively. Eighty-five patients (72.0%) of 118 replied were in NYHA functional class I, 31 (26.3%) in class II and 2 (1.7%) in class III. Thirteen patients (7.8%) demonstrated right ventricular/left ventricular systolic pressure ratio over 0.80 because of inadequate relief of the pulmonary stenosis or obstruction, hypoplasia of the pulmonary artery or external conduit stenosis. Although the left ventricular ejection fraction was maintained at normal range (0.65 +/- 0.09), that of the right ventricule was below normal level (0.52 +/- 0.09). Two patients developed complete heart block postoperatively and underwent pacemaker implantations. Complete right bundle branch block was observed in 85 patients including 6 with left axis deviation. It is concluded that early correction even in the early infancy, adequate enlargement of the right ventricular outflow tract and minimal right ventriculotomy should be applied for correction of tetralogy of Fallot.
