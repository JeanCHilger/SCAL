Clinical evaluation of a paclitaxel-eluting balloon for treatment of femoropopliteal arterial disease: 12-month results from a multicenter Italian registry. This study evaluated the use of a paclitaxel-eluting balloon (PEB) for treatment of femoropopliteal arterial disease.Conventional balloon angioplasty and stenting in this setting is associated with high restenosis rates within 12 months. Recent data suggest that PEB use may reduce restenosis. Twelve-month outcomes following PEB use with provisional stenting are described.This prospective registry enrolled patients (Rutherford class 2 to 4) with reference vessel diameter of 3 to 7 mm and lesion/occlusion length ≤ 15 cm. Endpoints included primary patency rate, target lesion revascularization, and changes in Rutherford class and ankle-brachial index. Walking capacity, absolute claudication distance, and quality of life were also assessed.The registry enrolled 105 patients. Baseline ankle-brachial index was 0.56 ± 0.15. Baseline Rutherford classification was class 2 or 3 for most patients (91.5%). Most lesions were located in the superficial femoral artery (77.1%). Mean lesion length was 76.3 ± 38.3 mm 29.8% of lesions were total occlusions. The device was successfully used in all patients and only 12.3% of lesions required stenting. At 12-month follow-up, 92 of 105 patients (87.6%) were evaluablePEB treatment of femoropopliteal arterial disease resulted in consistent clinical improvement across multiple endpoints with a low rate of stenting and target lesion revascularization.
