Carotid extra-medial thickness in childhood: early life effects on the arterial adventitia. Structural modification of the arterial adventitia may be an early event in atherosclerosis. Carotid extra-medial thickness is a new measure of arterial adventitial thickness. We examined the association of cardiovascular risk factors with extra-medial thickness, in childhood.Carotid extra-medial thickness was assessed by high-resolution ultrasound in 389 non-diabetic children aged 8-years. A non-fasting blood sample was collected from 314 participants. Associations of gender, age, lipoproteins, blood pressure, BMI z-score, waist:height ratio and parental history of early vascular disease, with extra-medial thickness were examined.Carotid extra-medial thickness was lower in girls (r=-.163, P=.001) and directly associated with systolic (r=.128, P=.009), diastolic blood pressure (r=.130, P=.009), and height (r=.170, P=.0006). These associations remained after adjustment for carotid intima-media thickness. In multivariable analysis including carotid intima-media thickness, only gender and height were significantly associated with carotid extra-medial thickness. In gender-stratified analysis, the strongest associations with extra-medial thickness were BMI z-score (r=.181, P=.01), height (r=.210, P=.003) and diastolic blood pressure (r=.167, P=.02) for boys and systolic blood pressure (r=.153, P=.03) and parental history of premature cardiovascular disease (r=.139, P=.05) for girls. The association of BMI z-score with extra-medial thickness differed by gender (P-interaction=.04).Carotid extra-medial thickness is independently associated with gender and height in childhood. Extra-medial thickness may provide important information concerning early arterial health, particularly related to the arterial adventitia.
