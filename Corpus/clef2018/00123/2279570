Assessment of intermittent claudication by quantitation of exercise-induced microalbuminuria. Urinary albumin excretion rates, expressed as albumin-creatinine ratios (ACR, mg/mmol) were measured before and after exercise in 23 claudicants and 10 controls. The mean (range) resting ACRs in the claudicants and controls were 4.42 (0.2-34.6) and 0.77 (0.3-2.8) respectively (P less than 0.001). ACR increased after exercise by a mean of 153% in claudicants to 9.7 (0.2-48.1 P less than 0.001) with no change in controls, 0.79 (0.2-2.1). In patients with claudication there was a positive correlation between ankle pressure recovery time and the relative increase in ACR after exercise (r = 0.64, P less than 0.01). The post-exercise increase in ACR was reduced in all nine patients who underwent bypass surgery. Measurement of ACR after exercise appears to be related to severity of muscle ischaemia and may assist in the assessment of patients with intermittent claudication.
