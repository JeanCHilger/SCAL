Atherosclerosis--multi-organ involvement the rule rather than the exception. Atherosclerosis is a systemic disorder and significant lesions often occur in organ systems other than the symptomatic area. Three groups of patients, those admitted to hospital with either coronary artery disease, carotid artery stenosis or peripheral vascular disease, were examined for concomitant atherosclerotic lesions. Non-invasive tests, namely duplex scanning of the carotid arteries, arm ergometer exercise testing, and segmental pressure of the limbs, were used during evaluation. A clear association between ischaemic heart disease, carotid artery stenosis and femoropopliteal disease was found. Women appear to be more prone to multi-organ involvement than men their higher average age on admission to hospital is a possible explanation for this in some cases, but not all.
