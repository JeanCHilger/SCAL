Peripheral arterial occlusive disease: P-31 MR spectroscopy of calf muscle. The effect of a graded exercise protocol on phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy of calf skeletal muscle in nine healthy (control) subjects and 16 patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) was assessed. Ankle-brachial pressure indexes were obtained in all 16 patients, and 10 patients underwent peripheral arteriography. Temporal profiles of pH and the inorganic phosphorus (Pi) index were calculated from the spectra. A Pi-index recovery rate constant was calculated for each subject. Arteriograms were graded by calculating the runoff resistance in the limb of interest. The pH profiles during exercise did not differ significantly between the PAOD patients and control subjects. The Pi-index recovery rate constant in the PAOD patients was significantly (P less than .01) smaller than in the control subjects. There was no significant correlation between recovery rate and the ankle-brachial pressure indexes, but there was a strong negative correlation between recovery rates and angiographic resistance grades, with smaller recovery rate constants in patients with increased arterial resistance. It is concluded that P-31 MR spectroscopy shows promise as a direct measure of tissue perfusion.
