Doppler color flow imaging. By simultaneous processing of frequency, phase, and amplitude information in the backscattered ultrasound signal, new instruments now permit the real-time display of high-resolution grey scale images of tissue combined with the simultaneous display of flow data from vessels within the scan plane. Doppler Color Flow Imaging, or DCFI, using such processing, permits blood flow direction and relative velocity to be detected and displayed in a color encoded display from throughout the ultrasound image. We have tested a new Doppler color flow imaging system over a period of two years to evaluate the carotid arteries, peripheral arteries and veins, and dialysis fistulas. In the abdomen and pelvis we have imaged blood flow to the liver, spleen, kidneys, uterus and renal transplants. Our experience in over 500 patients leads us to conclude that DCFI has significant advantages over conventional duplex Doppler sonography for blood flow evaluation. For examination of carotid and peripheral vessels, we have found DCFI to permit more rapid assessment in both normal and abnormal states. Areas of vessel narrowing or turbulent flow may be identified rapidly and accurately, and vessel orientation may be determined precisely, allowing accurate calculation of blood flow velocity from Doppler frequency shifts. The system we have used has adequate penetration and sensitivity to allow imaging of hepatic and renal blood flow and is extremely promising as a method of imaging organ perfusion and in the detection of abnormalities of perfusion that accompany disease, such as transplant rejection. Tumor vascularity may also be identified with DCFI, opening the possibility of additional clinical applications.
