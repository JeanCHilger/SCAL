Reocclusion for persistent shunting after catheter placement of the Rashkind patent ductus arteriosus occluder. Between February 1986 and January 1989, 105 percutaneous catheter occlusions of patent ductus arteriosus were undertaken, with six patients having residual left-to-right shunting confirmed by colour-flow Doppler nine months to years after initial occlusion. Five of six had successful reocclusion by placement of a second 12 mm Rashkind device. All successful reocclusions had continuous murmurs. Colour-flow Doppler characterized residual shunting as a discrete jet coursing superior to the device in five and through the pods in one. No left pulmonary artery obstruction was detected following placement of the second device. All patients were discharged the day of or the day following reocclusion.
