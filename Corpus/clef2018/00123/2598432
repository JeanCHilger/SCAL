Two-dimensional echocardiographic and color flow Doppler evaluation of ductal occlusion with the Rashkind prosthesis. To evaluate the results of ductal occlusion with the Rashkind prosthesis, 78 children (group 1, 19 boys and 59 girls mean age at occlusion, 4.5 +/- 4.0 years) with isolated patent ductus arteriosus (n = 73) or in association with other lesions (n = 5) were evaluated by pulsed and color flow Doppler 9 +/- 7 months (range, 2-26 months) after occlusion. Thirty children who had undergone patent ductus arteriosus ligation (group 2, 9 boys and 21 girls
