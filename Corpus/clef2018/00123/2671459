Effect of the calcium antagonist nifangin on hemodynamics in patients with congestive heart failure. Nifangin (nifedipine), manufactured by the Laakepharmos Co., Finland, was used in 75 patients with congestive heart failure due to ischemic heart disease and chronic obstructive bronchitis. The effect of a single 20 mg dose and a course of treatment (60 mg daily for 18 days) was assessed by monitoring with the help of echocardiography, venous occlusion plethysmography, laser Doppler flowmetry as well as external respiration and blood gases partial tension measurement. In patients with chronic obstructive bronchitis, the drug was used in combination with cardiac glycosides and diuretics. A single dose of nifangin reduced regional vascular resistance by 33%, and increased volumetric blood flow rate by 51%. The treatment course increased the stroke index and the cardiac index (by 21 and 23%, respectively) and improved blood oxygenation and external respiration parameters. The absence of side effects makes nifangin one of the most effective vasodilating agents, indicated for patients with congestive heart failure.
