Clinical evaluation of a new anti-aliasing technique for ultrasound pulsed Doppler analysis. Clinical evaluation of a new method of Doppler spectral analysis is discussed in this paper. According to this method, which basically involves a proper reformatting of the data provided by a conventional spectrum analyser, the frequency range usually considered in pulsed systems is considerably extended. This has been demonstrated even in extreme clinical conditions, corresponding to tight stenosis in major arteries. Details of materials and methods employed in this evaluation are included. Examples of experimental results are reported, along with a discussion about some possible applications of the new technique.
