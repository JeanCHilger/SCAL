Diagnosis and treatment of carotid artery stenoses. 20 to 30% of all strokes are caused by stenosing processes of the extracranial part of the carotids. The frequency and severity of cerebrovascular disease can be reduced by early diagnosis and treatment. Ultrasonography consisting of Doppler flow analysis and B-mode imaging sonography is an excellent diagnostic procedure for screening patients with suspected cerebrovascular disease so that morbidity and mortality are supposed to be lowered in future. This survey will briefly review different types of surgical and pharmacological therapy in the context of primary and secondary prevention of stroke.
