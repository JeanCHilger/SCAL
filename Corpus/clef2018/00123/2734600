Transcranial duplex sonography through intact bone: a new diagnostic procedure. Transcranial duplex scanning as a new diagnostic procedure is described for the first time. This method allows Doppler sonographic registration of flow profiles of basal cerebral arteries through the intact skull with simultaneous demonstration of pulsating vessels and cerebral structures in the B-mode scan. The exact localisation of the registered Doppler profile can be demonstrated under direct visual control in a clearly defined section of the cerebral artery. Therefore, an angle correction of the recorded Doppler-shift is possible allowing determination of true flow velocity. Occlusion of basal cerebral arteries can be diagnosed visually with this method. The use procedure in 51 children and adolescents aged 18 months to 19 years is described.
