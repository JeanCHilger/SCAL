Venous occlusion plethysmography reduces arterial diameter and flow velocity. The measurement of peripheral blood flow by plethysmography assumes that the cuff pressure required for venous occlusion does not decrease arterial inflow. However, studies in five normal subjects suggested that calf blood flow measured with a plethysmograph was less than arterial inflow calculated from Doppler velocity measurements. We hypothesized that the pressure required for venous occlusion may have decreased arterial velocity. Further studies revealed that systolic diameter of the superficial femoral artery under a thigh cuff decreased from 7.7 +/- 0.4 to 5.6 +/- 0.7 mm (P less than 0.05) when the inflation pressure was increased from 0 to 40 mmHg. Cuff inflation to 40 mmHg also reduced mean velocity 38% in the common femoral artery and 47% in the popliteal artery. Inflation of a cuff on the arm reduced mean velocity in the radial artery 22% at 20 mmHg, 26% at 40 mmHg, and 33% at 60 mmHg. We conclude that inflation of a cuff on an extremity to low pressures for venous occlusion also caused a reduction in arterial diameter and flow velocity.
