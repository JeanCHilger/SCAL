Balloon dilation of postoperative right ventricular outflow obstructions. Balloon dilation was attempted in 16 patients, aged 5 months to 19.5 years, with right ventricular outflow obstruction after repair of congenital heart defects. Stenosis of a valved conduit between the pulmonary ventricle and pulmonary artery was present in nine patients with a mean transvalvular peak systolic ejection gradient of 61.6 +/- 21.0 mm Hg and a mean right ventricle to aorta pressure ratio of 0.9 +/- 0.2. Supravalvular pulmonary stenosis was present in seven patients in five, stenosis was at the anastomotic site after the arterial switch operation with a mean peak systolic ejection gradient of 72.2 +/- 10.6 mm Hg and mean right ventricle to aorta pressure ratio of 0.93 +/- 0.05. The other two patients had stenosis at a previous pulmonary artery band site with a peak systolic ejection gradient of 60 and 65 mm Hg and right ventricle to aorta pressure ratio of 0.75 and 0.72, respectively. Balloon dilation was successful in three of nine patients with a valved conduit
