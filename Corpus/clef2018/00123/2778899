Percutaneous laser probe femoropopliteal angioplasty: a preliminary experience. Percutaneous laser probe "hot tip" angioplasty procedures were performed on 47 occluded femoropopliteal artery segments in 27 men and 10 women ranging in age from 31 to 92 (mean, 64.7) years. Indications for the procedure included claudication in 29 (78%) segments, and the occlusion lased was greater than 7 cm in length in 51% of the procedures. Failure to recanalize the occlusion occurred in 14 (30%) segments, and recanalization followed by in-hospital reocclusion occurred in seven (15%) segments, yielding an initial failure rate of 45%. Initial failures were noted in 40% of the less than 3 cm occlusions, 33% of the 4 to 7 cm occlusions, and 54% of the greater than 7 cm occlusions. In nine (43%) instances in these 21 failures there was extension of the occluded segment or decline of the ankle/brachial index or both, precipitating the need for surgery in three (18%) of these 17 patients. Among the successfully treated group, 17 (65%) of these vessels in 15 patients reoccluded from 1 to 14 (mean, 3 1/2) months after the procedure. Cumulative patency among the successfully lased vessels was 69% at 1-month, 38% at 6 months', 29% at 12 months', and 14% at 15 months' follow-up. Fifteen-month patency was 7% of the entire series of 47 vessels treated. Eighteen complications occurred after 15 (32%) of these 47 procedures. Based on these results, the widespread application of laser probe angioplasty cannot be justified without further clinical and laboratory investigation.
