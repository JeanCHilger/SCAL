A comparison of proximal with distal arterial reconstruction in the treatment of advanced lower limb ischaemia. Elective arterial surgery for lower limb ischaemia due to chronic occlusive disease has been performed in 212 patients over a five-year period. Of this group, 93 patients were treated for limb-threatening ischaemia. The remainder were treated for intermittent claudication. The clinical and haemodynamic responses to surgery are analysed in this series of 93 patients. The results of proximal reconstruction, in terms of a living patient with patent graft and functional limb, were significantly better (75%) at one year than in patients undergoing distal segment reconstruction (45%). Successful aortoiliac surgery was associated with a mean increase in the ankle systolic pressure index of 0.36, comparied with 0.46 in the distal reconstruction group.
