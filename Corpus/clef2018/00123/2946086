Laser Doppler examination of peripheral microvascular reactivity. Several standardized physiologic tests of peripheral microvascular reactivity were monitored by the laser Doppler method in a control group and in seven patients with combined aortoiliac and superficial femoral artery occlusion before and after implantation of aortofemoral bifurcation grafts. The results showed that laser Doppler examination with equipment presently available is superfluous in the surgical vascular laboratory.
