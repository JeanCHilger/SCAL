Peripheral hemodynamics at various stages of deep vein thrombosis of the legs. A study of 46 patients at different stages of deep-vein thrombosis of the legs, using venous-occlusion plethysmography, doppler ultrasonic flowmetry and radiopaque phlebography, has identified structural and functional mechanisms compensating venous outflow for clinically inapparent nonocclusive thrombosis, acute occlusion of a major venous trunk and post-thrombotic disease.
