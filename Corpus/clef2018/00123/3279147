Doppler ultrasonic evaluation of the embolism-causing potential of carotid artery plaques. Apropos of 113 macroscopic findings. Comparison was made between precise descriptions of gross pathology of 113 carotid artery atheromatous plaques (69 symptomatic, 44 asymptomatic) operated upon by thromboendarterectomy and results of ultrasound-Doppler examinations, to determine possible specific ultrasound criteria for precise anatomical lesions. Echographic criteria studied were: ultrasonic structure of plaques relation of plaque to wall
