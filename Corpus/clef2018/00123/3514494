Treatment of claudication with dipyridamole and aspirin. The effects of dipyridamole in association with acetylsalicylic acid were compared with the effects of acetylsalicylic acid alone in patients with peripheral vascular disease. The following parameters were studied in each patient: symptoms-free interval on the treadmill, ankle-arm arterial pressure gradient, oscillographic index, venous occlusion plethysmography and any untoward reactions. Changes were observed in the pain-free interval (p less than 0.005), and in the venous occlusion plethysmography (p less than 0.001) in the patients treated with the two drugs in association.
