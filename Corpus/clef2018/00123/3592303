Transcutaneous oxygen tension behavior in the different stages of peripheral vascular disease and its correlation with ankle/arm pressure ratio and calf blood flow. The practical utility of transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPO2) has been evaluated in 22 normal subjects and in 54 patients suffering from peripheral vascular disease (PVD) at various stages (II, III, IV), to define its clinical use in the diagnosis of PVD. Basal TcPO2 values can distinguish normal subjects only from stages III and IV PVD patients. In the case of stage II PVD patients the evaluation of the half-recovery time of TcPO2 basal values after an induced ischemia of the limb is mandatory. The study also showed that there are no significant statistical correlations among the TcPO2 values, Doppler, and plethysmographic parameters.
