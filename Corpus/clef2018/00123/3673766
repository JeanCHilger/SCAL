Capillary blood pressure. Human capillary blood pressure may be measured directly in nailfold capillaries of the fingers and toes. By applying servonulling pressure measuring techniques rapid fluctuations in capillary pressure may be recorded, opening the way to a greater understanding of capillary pressure control in health and disease. The estimation of mean pressure which may be accomplished manometrically is of value in determining the mechanism of oedema, identifying the site of raised peripheral resistance in disease states, evaluating the effects of vasoactive drugs on peripheral resistance, and investigating haemodynamic abnormalities associated with microangiopathies. Capillary pulse waveform analysis, made possible by servonulling techniques and computer analysis has already revealed important changes in hypertension.
