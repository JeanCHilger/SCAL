tcpO2, arterial blood flow and lactate/pyruvate modifications induced by a single dose of naftidrofuryl IV during stage III lower-limb arteriopathies. A single dose of 600 mg of naftidrofuryl perfused IV during three hours in 12 stage III arteriopathic patients did not modify the average blood flow at the calf but did significantly increase transcutaneous oxygen pressure (33 vs 52 mmHg) and also improved lactates (1.44 vs 0.88 mmol/liter), pyruvate (59 vs 79 mumol/liter), and lactates-pyruvates ratio (33.48 vs 20.92).
