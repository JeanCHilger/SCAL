Stenosis following carotid endarterectomy. Carotid endarterectomy is well established in the treatment of selected cases of atherosclerosis of the carotid bifurcation but the incidence of restenosis is unknown. During a four year period 80 endarterectomies of the internal carotid artery were performed in 73 patients. Post-operatively we studied our patients prospectively by means of Doppler ultrasound in combination with real time spectral analysis and where indicated digital venous angiography to determine the incidence of restenosis. We report a 12.5% incidence of stenosis following carotid endarterectomy with a 1% incidence of symptomatic restenosis. We therefore question the role of carotid endarterectomy in the treatment of asymptomatic carotid stenosis.
