The effect of intravenous prostaglandin E1 on ischaemic pain and on leg blood-flow in subjects with peripheral artery disease: a double-blind controlled study. The effect of intravenous PGE1 (15 micrograms/h for 72 h) and saline (placebo) on ischaemic resting pains and the macro- and microcirculation was studied in 16 patients with peripheral artery disease. No significant difference in pain relief was observed between PGE1 and placebo. The calf blood-flow was unchanged during both infusions. Skin temperature in the arteriosclerotic foot, however, increased significantly during PGE1 infusion but not during saline infusion. No significant effects were seen on blood-pressure, fluorescein angiography or vital capillary microscopy of the big toe 1 week or 1 month after the PGE1 and placebo infusions.
