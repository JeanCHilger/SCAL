Effects of ischemia on capillary density and flow velocity in nailfolds of human toes. The purpose of this study was to investigate reactive hyperemia in the capillary network of human skin in terms of the flow per capillary and the density of flow-active capillaries. Seventeen male subjects 20 to 40 years of age were seated with their right foot placed on the stage of a Leitz epi-ilumination microscope such that the nailfold capillary field in their large toes could be viewed. These vessels were video taped while flow velocity in the right posterior tibial artery was recorded via Doppler ultrasound at rest, then following a 45-sec period of arterial occlusion to the foot. Subsequent to experimentation flow velocity in single nailfold capillaries was measured via video densitometry and the number of flow-active capillaries in the field of view were counted. Following the release of arterial occlusion arterial flow velocity increased 142% above rest, the velocity in single capillaries increased by 54%, and the density of flow-active capillaries, as identified by the presence of red cells, decreased by 37%. The fact that capillary flow velocity increased to a lesser degree than arterial velocity during reactive hyperemia vis-a-vis a decrease in the number of flow-active capillaries indicates that ischemia to the foot elicits a smaller dilatory effect in vascular elements controlling blood flow to the superficial cutaneous region of the toe as compared to other regional vascular networks.
