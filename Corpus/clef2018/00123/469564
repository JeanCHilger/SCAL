Assessment of directional Doppler ultrasound techniques in the diagnosis of carotid artery diseases. Three diagnostic techniques based on the use of directional doppler ultrasound have been evaluated in comparison with direct percutaneous carotid angiography and arch aortography. The results indicate that the non-invasive techniques provide a safe, atraumatic method of assessing patients with symptoms of extracranial occlusive arterial disease.
