Angiological functional evaluation following transluminal catheter recanalization. The percutaneous transluminal angioplasty is regarded as valuable enrichment of the therapeutical possibilities in peripheral arterial obstructive disease. Frequently by its application an arterial dilatation of the lumen and thus a local improvement of the blood supply can be achieved. As was shown by our measurements the haemodynamic factors and the quality of the prophylaxis of recidivations by medicaments have a decisive influence on the early results. Apart from clinical and X-ray morphological findings also oscillographic, Doppler-sonographic, plethysmographic and ergometric parameters are used for indication. In the same way angiological examinations of the function were performed within the further control of course and therapy. Changes of the peripheral haemodynamics could be particularly well read at the behaviour of the systolic pressure gradients and indices. When the technical and apparative prerequisites for the performance of the percutaneous transluminal angioplasty are given, the close interdisciplinary cooperation between radiologists and angiologists is important for achievement of optimum results of the treatment.
