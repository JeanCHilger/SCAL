Differential diagnosis of arterial disease of the lower limb using Doppler ultrasound. Doppler arterial waveforms from the femoral and ankle arteries of 55 normal control subjects and 76 arteriopaths were analysed for Laplace transform coefficients, delta and omega omicron, and pulsatility index (PI). At the femoral artery delta was superior to PI in accurately detecting mild and moderate aortoiliac stenosis, as assessed from arteriograms. In the femoropopliteal segment, the ratio of omega omicron from femoral to ankle level compared favourably with PI damping factor in the detection of occlusive disease. The Laplace transform system provides a helpful diagnostic method in lower limb arterial disease.
