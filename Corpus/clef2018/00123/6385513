New aspects in the diagnosis of venous and lymphatic diseases of the legs. A survey on new methods for the detection of deep vein thromboses and for the investigation of lymphedemas of the lower extremities is given. Doppler-ultrasound, plethysmography and tele-thermography are valuable screening procedures for the detection of a deep vein thrombosis. Nuclear medical methods such as 131 J fibrinogen or 99-m-TC-plasmin-uptake test as well as isotopic phlebography are additional non-invasive procedures. For the routine diagnosis of lymphedema, isotopic lymphography can be recommended. Recently described methods such as quantitative isotopic lymphography and indirect lymphography with the new contrast medium Iotasul will probably enhance our present knowledge concerning pathophysiology and therapeutical effects in lymphedemas.
