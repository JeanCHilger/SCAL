Use of noninvasive electromagnetic flowmetry in the assessment of peripheral arterial disease. The need for noninvasive techniques capable of quantitating peripheral arterial insufficiency is becoming increasingly obvious. We have shown the technique of noninvasive elctromagnetic flowmetry to be capable of distinguishing three relatively discrete clinical zones by quantitating the peak pulsatile flow of blood through the thigh and calf. The obtained peak pulsatile flow values were in close agreement with ischemic index values previously reported as grading the degree of ischemia in a patient. In certain patients, the noninvasive electromagnetic flowmeter has yielded information not readily available from Doppler systolic pressure measurements. With the noninvasive technique of electromagnetic flowmetry and Doppler ultrasound, it is possible to confirm and quantitate patient complaints, follow disease progression and document improvement following arterial reconstructive operations. The noninvasive electromagnetic flowmeter has also been shown to be invaluable in the selection of the operative procedure by providing information about arterial run-on, run-in and run-off.
