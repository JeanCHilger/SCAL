Occlusive peripheral arterial disease. Guidelines for office management. Occlusive peripheral arterial disease is rather easy to diagnose because of its characteristic symptoms and the ease with which the extremities and their circulation can be examined. Elevation and dependency tests give a rough but reliable estimate of the degree of ischemia, and if more objective data are desired, the systolic blood pressure index can be determined. Management should be individualized according to the degree of disability and ischemia, the expected natural history, and the patient's general health.
