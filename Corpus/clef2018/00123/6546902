Effects of the selective thromboxane synthetase inhibitor dazoxiben on variations in cyclic blood flow in stenosed canine coronary arteries. Recent studies suggest that platelet activation and subsequent thromboxane (TX) A2 release play important roles in certain coronary syndromes. To further test this possibility, we examined the ability of a selective TXA2-synthetase inhibitor, dazoxiben (UK-37-248), to abolish cyclic flow reductions (CFRs) that occur in experimentally stenosed canine coronary arteries. CFRs, which are characterized by progressive declines in coronary blood flow and interrupted by sudden and usually spontaneous restorations of flow, were produced by placing hard plastic cylindrical constrictors (5 mm long X 4.5 mm outer diameter) on the proximal left anterior descending or circumflex coronary artery in open-chest, anesthetized dogs. Coronary blood flow was measured with pulsed Doppler flow probes placed proximal to the constrictors and regional myocardial blood flow with 15 micron radiolabeled microspheres. CFRs were observed for 1 hr, during which coronary blood flow was monitored continuously. Regional myocardial blood flow was measured before constriction, when coronary blood flow appeared to be at its nadir, and after spontaneous restorations of flow. After 1 hr dazoxiben (2.5 mg/kg iv) or an equal volume of saline was given and coronary blood flow was monitored for another hour. Dazoxiben abolished CFRs completely in 18 of 28 dogs and significantly reduced their frequency in the dogs receiving the drug (10.1 +/- 0.8 vs 3.2 +/- 1.0 per hour [+/- SE] p less than .001, n = 28). The frequency and magnitude of variations in cyclic blood flow were unchanged after saline (8.8 +/- 0.8 vs 9.0 +/- 1.0 per hour
