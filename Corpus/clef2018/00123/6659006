Doppler ultrasound assessment of the internal carotid artery following carotid endarterectomy. Doppler-shifted ultrasound with spectral analysis was used to assess the internal carotid arteries of 48 patients who had undergone carotid endarterectomy (58 carotid endarterectomies). Three patients died in the immediate post-operative period, therefore 45 patients, who represented 54 endarterectomies, were assessed for up to six years following surgery (mean--thirty-four months). Ultrasound tests demonstrated total occlusion of the internal carotid artery in 7 patients within the first post-operative week. Sonograms from the supraorbital and common carotid arteries exhibit two peaks during cardiac systole (A and B). The post-operative A/B ratios were abnormal in 24 instances and these were associated with symptoms in seven. Of these 24, 7 developed severe disease in the internal carotid artery during the six year follow-up period five were associated with symptoms. Post-operative A/B ratios were normal in 23 instances, 19 of which remained normal at follow-up. None of these nineteen developed symptoms. Only patients with abnormal post-operative A/B ratios subsequently developed severe occlusive disease in the internal carotid artery during the follow-up assessment. Thirty-eight patients underwent unilateral carotid endarterectomy, eight of whom had severe internal carotid artery disease at the contralateral bifurcation at the time of carotid endarterectomy. A further four patients developed severe occlusive disease in the contralateral internal carotid artery during the follow-up period, one of whom was symptomatic.
