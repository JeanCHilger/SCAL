Limitations of human umbilical vein grafts. Sixty modified human umbilical vein (HUV) grafts were used for arterial reconstruction in 48 patients between December 1979 and December 1981. Forty-four patients had limb-threatening ischemia (rest pain or tissue loss) and four had disabling claudication. Thirty-four patients had HUV grafting after a primary arterial reconstruction had failed. Fourteen had HUV used for their initial arterial bypass. The distal anastomosis was to the popliteal artery in 27 grafts (5 above and 22 below the knee) and the distal calf arteries in 33 (anterior tibial 10, posterior tibial 9, peroneal 14). The cumulative patency rate, calculated by the modified life-table method, was 34% at 1 year and 18% at 2 years. Fifteen patients required major amputation after graft failure 13 of these healed below the knee. Preoperative and postoperative ankle/brachial systolic pressure indices and intraoperative blood flow did not correlate with graft failure. These results reflect the limitations of HUV as a graft material in patients with severe ischemia of the lower extremities. The prognostic factors that determined the outcome of arterial reconstruction with HUV in these patients remain to be defined.
