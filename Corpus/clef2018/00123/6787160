Long term follow up of patients with intermittent claudication and correlated with the management of risk factors (author's transl). The follow-up (3 to 20 years, mean = 8,9 yrs) of 145 patients with intermittent claudication showed the high incidence of tobacco use (86%) hyperlipidemia (43%) elevated blood pressure (45%) and glucose intolerance (30%), two or more of these factors were present in 66% of cases. A statistically significant higher rate of fairly reduced risk factors was noted in 57 patients improved functionally (based on the maximal walking distance on treadmill and arm/ankle systolic pressure ratio) versus 45 functionally impaired patients, and in 55 patients free of CHD, compared with 54 patients with coronary events (p 0.001). A group of 26 patients with cerebro-vascular insufficiency exhibited a higher incidence of non reduced hypertensive cases.
