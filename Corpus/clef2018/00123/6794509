Isolated intimal stenosis of the renal artery and curable arterial hypertension in Recklinghausen's disease. Association of hypoplastic stenosis of the aortic and pulmonary trunks and sigmoid aortic regurgitation. The case of a patient with Von Recklinghausen's disease with multiple localisations, cardiac, aortic, pulmonary and renal artery is reported. Neurofibromatosis was confirmed by the presence of a "royal" tumour on the left elbow and of many "caf√© au lait" spots of over 15 mm diameter. There was no craniofacial dysmorphism or intellectual impairment. The karyotype was normal. The cardiovascular lesions comprised: - stenosis of the left renal artery resulting in renovascular hypertension. This was due to pure intimal hyperplasia - supravalvular aortic stenosis with hypoplasia of the ascending aorta. There was no craniofacial dysmorphism or intellectual impairment. The karyotype was normal. The cardiovascular lesions comprised: - stenosis of the left renal artery resulting in renovascular hypertension. This was due to pure intimal hyperplasia
