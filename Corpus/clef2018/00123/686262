New Doppler pressure indexes plotted as curves. Curve configuration used to determine sites of arterial obstruction. Brachial, femoral (in the groin), popliteal, and tibial systolic blood pressures were determined with the Doppler technic. New indexes were developed: femoral/brachial (B/B), popliteal/femoral (P/F), ankle/femoral (A/F), and ankle/popliteal (A/P). Curves were plotted using these indexes and compared with established configurations. As a result the site or sites of obstruction were rapidly determined.
