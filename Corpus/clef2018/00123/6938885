Evaluation of lingual artery hemodynamics in stroke patients using Doppler ultrasound. Doppler blood flow studies were carried out on deep lingual arteries of young adults and stroke patients to see how the hemodynamics of this artery would be altered in the stroke group, who were selected on the basis of their having carotid atherosclerosis. The healthy controls exhibited a consistent and characteristic velocity pulse profile, which included a distinctive dichrotic notch and significant diastolic flow. The stroke group especially lacked these two critical parameters, and some exhibited amorphous flow patterns and cardiac arrhythmias. Implications of these findings in relationship to atherosclerosis are discussed.
