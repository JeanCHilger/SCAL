Chronic vascular disease of the upper extremity: radiologic and clinical features. The major chronic vascular diseases of the upper extremity are (1) subclavian artery occlusions, (2) thoracic outlet syndrome, and (3) angiospastic disease of the hand. Central subclavian artery lesions ease of the hand. Central subclavian artery lesions can have either hemodynamic consequences (subclavian steal syndrome) or, by peripheral embolization, can provoke ischemic symptoms of the hand. Costoclavicular narrowing can cause functional or fixed stenosis of the subclavian artery and can also involve the vein or brachial plexus. Symptoms due to pressure on the brachial plexus are most frequent, but embolization to the peripheral vessels may also occur. Angiospastic disease, the most frequent lesion of upper extremity vessels, comprises three types: Raynaud's disease, in which there are intermittent attacks of coldness and discoloration without evidence of occlusion on the angiogram asphyxia manus et digitorum in which the attacks are also intermittent but there is morphologic evidence of occlusion
