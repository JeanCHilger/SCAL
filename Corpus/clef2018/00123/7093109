Studies of the haemodynamic effects of creatine phosphate in man. 1 The haemodynamic effects of intravenous creatine phosphate 1000 mg have been studied. 2 During the first 60 min following drug administration heart rate and blood pressure did not change but cardiac output fell significantly by approximately 18%. Calculated total peripheral resistance showed a corresponding significant rise, the maximum increase being approximately 24%. All these changes were beginning to diminish within 90 min after the injection. 3 Total limb blood flow measured in both arm and leg (using venous occlusion strain-gauge plethysmography) showed no appreciable changes following injection of creatine phosphate. 4 There was a progressive reduction in leg muscle blood flow (Xe133 clearance method) following injection which was statistically significant with respect to the initial level and reached a minimum (46% reduction) 50 min after the injection. 5 Skin blood flow, estimated by infra-red photoplethysmography, showed changes complementary to those seen with muscle flow. There was a progressive and significant rise to a peak (73% increase) 30 min after the injection. 6 No adverse reactions to the injections were noted. 7 Reduced cardiac output in the absence of altered total limb blood flow presumably reflects a reduction in visceral blood flow, which was not measured in this study. Within the limbs, creatine phosphate appears to result in a redistribution of blood flow from muscle to skin. Thus, these preliminary results suggest that intravenous creatine phosphate could be clinically useful in situations where short term improvement in skin blood flow would be advantageous and that further controlled studies would be justified.
