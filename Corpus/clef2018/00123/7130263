Criteria for prognostic evaluation of the results of lumbar sympathectomy: clinical, haemodynamic and angiographic findings. Lumbar sympathectomy still has an important role in the surgical treatment of occlusive peripheral arterial diseases of the lower limbs located below the inguinal ligament, when the presence of peripheral lesions makes revascularization difficult. A consecutive series of 143 patients who underwent lumbar sympathectomy was considered, and the clinical, angiographic and haemodynamic findings evaluated. Haemodynamic studies on these patients showed a relation between the clinical improvement and the pressure index, measured at the ankle before lumbar sympathectomy. The patients with pressure index values above 0.5 had a symptomatic improvement whereas the patients with a pressure index below 0.3 gave less good results. It is therefore believed that lumbar sympathectomy showed not be considered a second operative choice but an elective operation, especially in patients affected by lesion of the superficial femoral artery, the popliteal artery and its branches, with pressure indices above 0.5 where revascularization is not possible.
