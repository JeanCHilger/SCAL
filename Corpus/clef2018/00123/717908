Objective assessment of femoral artery profundaplasty. The physiologic results after profundaplasty in a group of patients with uncorrected complete occlusion of superficial femoral artery are presented. The limbs were evaluated by ankle B.P. index and muscle pH, and pulse volume plethysmograph showed that the deep femoral artery, in occlusion of superficial femoral artery, can provide pulsatile flow and adequate perfusion to calf muscles in most cases.
