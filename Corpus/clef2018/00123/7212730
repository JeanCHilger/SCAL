Blue fingertips associated with myxedema. A 42-year-old woman had blue telangiectases of the fingertips associated with myxedema. In addition to this clinical finding, the patient had abnormal Doppler ultrasound study findings analogous to those seen in peripheral vascular occlusion. With thyroid replacement therapy, the telangiectases disappeared, and a dramatic improvement was noted in the results of the Doppler studies. We believe that the clinical picture seen in our patient was caused by the deposition of mucin around small blood vessels.
