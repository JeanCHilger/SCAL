Isolated profunda femoris artery occlusion: the mechanism of thigh claudication studied by 99mTc muscle clearance from the thigh and calf. 99mTc muscle clearance from the gastrocnemius and quadriceps and ankle pressure measurements have been studied in 5 limbs of 5 patients with an isolated profunda femoris artery occlusion shown on the aortogram. The changes of flow and pressure which occurred after exercise may explain the hemodynamics of thigh claudication which is the consequence of thigh deprivation in favour of calf flow.
