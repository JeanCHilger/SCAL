An evaluation of currently available, noninvasive tests of carotid artery disease. A clinical study compared compression ophthalmodynamometry, suction ophthalmodynamometry, oculoplethysmography, modified oculopneumoplethysmography, and Doppler flow studies with graded arteriography for the detection of carotid artery stenosis. Compression ophthalmodynamometry and suction ophthalmodynamometry were the most accurate tests in this series with the results of both types of ophthalmodynanometry almost identical. A new, noninvasive procedure, oculocerebrovasculometry, was also performed in a slightly different group of patients. This procedure has theoretic advantages over the others tested because it measures directly the intraocular pressure as the end point of the test.
