Importance of penile arterial pulse sound examination in impotence. Experience with the Doppler ultrasound examination of penile arteries in 93 impotent men is presented. The technique for this examination is a simple, reliable, inexpensive office procedure for the detection of penile arterial obstruction in patients with impotence. With this test 44 per cent of impotent men were found to have obstructive blood flow in the penis as the cause of impotence. A 95 per cent accuracy rate with this technique was confirmed by penile angiography in 22 patients. Since impotence is a common problem facing the clinicians it is important to detect penile arterial disease--a main causal agent of many impotent men.
