Percutaneous dilatation and recanalization of iliac and femoral arteries. Five-year follow-up studies in patients with superficial femoral arterial occlusions and iliac artery stenoses have demonstrated a high success rate with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty performed by the Dotter technique. The special balloon catheters developed by Gr√ºntzig, a standardized accessory pharmaceutical regimen, and more exact indications have further increased the rate of long-term success the patency rates now approach 70% after three years. Clinical follow-up studies by Doppler ultrasound are useful for assessing the hemodynamic effects of the procedure.
