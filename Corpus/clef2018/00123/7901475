Non-invasively detected carotid stenosis and ischaemic heart disease in men with leg arteriosclerosis. Since the excess mortality rate associated with an ankle-brachial blood-pressure index (ABPI) less than 0.9 was only partly explained by an excess cardiovascular mortality, we believe that leg artery disease should not only be regarded as a marker of generalised arteriosclerosis but also as a sign associated with an increased risk of premature death. 439 men who were part of a prospective population study in Malm√∂, Sweden, were, at 68 years of age, invited to a health examination including, ABPI, carotid-artery ultrasonography, and 24 h ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. Cause-specific mortality and incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) during 8 years of follow-up was compared in men with and without signs of arteriosclerotic disease. Of 60 men with an ABPI < 0.9, 20 (33%) had angina pectoris or previous MI. Another 11 (18%) had silent ST-segment depression (> or = 1 mm) 3 (5%) had a history of stroke
