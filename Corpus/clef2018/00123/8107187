Hepatic focal nodular hyperplasia: findings with color Doppler sonography. Color Doppler sonographic images of five patients with a total of six lesions of FNH were reviewed. All cases were confirmed pathologically. All six lesions showed increased intralesional flow in comparison to surrounding liver parenchyma on color Doppler sonography. Four of the six lesions showed significant peripheral flow two of the six lesions showed central flow radiating peripherally from a central vessel. We conclude that increased color Doppler flow may be a characteristic feature of FNH. Increased internal flow has also been reported in HCC and hepatic metastatic disease. Considerable overlap is seen in color Doppler flow patterns. However, in patients clinically at low risk for malignancy, detection of a liver mass with increased color Doppler flow should suggest the diagnosis of FNH.
