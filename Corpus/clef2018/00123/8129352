Prevalence of peripheral artery disease in patients with coronary artery disease. The incidence of coronary artery disease in Singapore has shown a rapid rise in recent years, however, there is a subjective impression that the prevalence of atherosclerotic peripheral artery diseases, although sharing common aetiological factors with coronary artery disease, has not shown a similar rise. We set out to determine the incidence of occlusive peripheral artery diseases of the lower limb in a selected population of Asian patients using a non-invasive test and we analysed the risk factors. The overall prevalence of peripheral artery disease of the subjects as determined by an abnormal ankle brachial index less than 0.9 in at least one limb was 19.1%. Increasing age, hypercholesterolemia and smoking were risk factors. In patients with proven coronary artery disease, abnormal ankle brachial indices were present in 21.3% of patients with angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease but in only 13.0% of those without. In this study, the incidence of peripheral artery disease in this selected Asian population was high. With the increasing availability of vascular laboratories and awareness of the diseases, we can expect to see increasing numbers of patients presenting with these problems.
