Morbidity and mortality in hypertensive adults with a low ankle/arm blood pressure index. To evaluate the relationship between the ankle/arm blood pressure index (AAI, the ratio of ankle to arm systolic blood pressure, a measure of peripheral arterial disease) and short-term cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in older adults with systolic hypertension.Prospective cohort study, 1- to 2-year follow-up (mean, 16 months).Eleven of 16 field centers from the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program.1537 older men and women with systolic hypertension.All-cause mortality, coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality, cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, and CHD and CVD morbidity and mortality.The AAI was measured at the 1989-1990 clinic examination and was 0.9 or less in 25.5% of 1537 participants. A low AAI was associated with most major CHD and CVD risk factors. In those with a low AAI (< or = 0.9) compared with those with an AAI of more than 0.9, age- and sex-adjusted relative risks for mortality end points at follow-up were as follows: total mortality, 3.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1 to 6.9) CHD mortality, 3.24 (95% CI, 1.4 to 7.5)A low AAI appears to be an important predictor of morbidity and mortality among older adults with systolic hypertension.
