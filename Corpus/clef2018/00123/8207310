Prevalence and prognostic value of peripheral arterial disease in stroke patients. As atherosclerosis is a multi-systemic disease, each patient presenting clinical manifestation of atherosclerosis such as a stroke or RIND should be, from a vascular point of view, globally evaluated. The availability of Doppler ultrasound technique enables us to discover the presence of Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) which is not always overt in the patient's history. Furthermore the presence of PAD is associated with a poorer prognosis in stroke patients.
