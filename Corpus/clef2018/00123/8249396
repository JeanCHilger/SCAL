Comparison of doppler examination results, arteriography and intraoperative findings in patients with ischemia of the lower extremities. The diagnostic value was assessed of the examination of artery stenosis in lower extremities by the Doppler method, and the results were compared with diagnosis made by means of arteriography, and intraoperatively. The analysis included 40 patients with atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, and Buerger disease. Ultrasonic normal values were determined for healthy arteries, and for insignificant and significant stenosis. Treating the intraoperative diagnosis as verifying the two other methods it was found that the per cent of correct diagnosis was similar for ultrasonography and intraoperative examination, and was 76% and 66% respectively. The Doppler examination supplemented arteriography in the evaluation of crural arteries, while arteriography supplemented Doppler examination in the evaluation of the deep femoral artery and the condition of collateral blood flow.
