Incidence of Doppler ultrasound detectable stenoses of cervical arteries in patients with cochlear-vestibular symptoms. Doppler ultrasound examination is an easy and non-invasive examination technique to image the anatomical and functional situation of cervical vessels. An increasing number of ENT-specialists has been using Doppler sonography in the diagnosis of cochlear and vestibular disorders. We analysed the frequency of pathological Doppler examination results of 150 patients with vertigo, hearing loss and tinnitus. Especially patients with vertigo bear a greater risk for stenosis of the extracranial arteries (28%) compared to an asymptomatical population (1%). Patients with hearing loss and tinnitus showed a different degree of artery disorders (23% of the patients with hearing loss 18% of the patients with tinnitus). Patients bearing no risk for atherosclerosis showed in 13% (vertigo) and 8% (hearing loss and tinnitus) stenosis of the cervical arteries. Thus we found by Doppler ultrasound examination more stenoses in patients with cochlear or vestibular symptoms than in an asymptomatical population. The early attribution of stenosis to a malfunction of the inner ear helps to avoid invasive examinations of cervical vessels. In addition to this, imminent cerebral ischaemia can be revealed at an early stage.
