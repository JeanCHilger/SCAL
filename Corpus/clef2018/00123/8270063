C-reactive protein and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein in monitoring of patients with chronic arterial occlusion of the lower limbs. C-reactive protein (CRP) and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) levels were studied in the sera of 107 patients with chronic arterial ischaemia of the lower limbs. Depending on the degree of ischaemia, patients were divided into four groups: (i) intermittent claudication--20 patients (ii) rest pain and ankle pressure above 50 mmHg--12 patients
