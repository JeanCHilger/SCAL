Blunt trauma with combined femoral arterial and venous occlusion. Blunt trauma to common femoral artery is rare, and it is frequently unrecognized. A 61-year-old man who fell while carrying a log and struck on his right groin, presented right leg edema and intermittent claudication one month later. Both right femoral arterial and venous occlusion was suspected by Doppler flowmeter, confirmed by venography and arteriography which showed concomitant external iliac arterial occlusion. He underwent prosthetic bypass grafting from common iliac artery to common femoral artery and embolectomy of femoral vein. Circulation to the right leg was restored, but postphlebitic syndrome had remained which was ameliorated by wearing the elastic stocking.
