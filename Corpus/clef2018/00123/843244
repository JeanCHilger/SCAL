Doppler ultrasound scanning of the carotid bifurcation. The results of Doppler scanning of 146 carotid bifurcations in 86 patients were correlated with carotid arteriography. The correlations for normal carotid arteries ranged from 63% to 98% the correlation for occlusions of carotid arteries was 100%. The Doppler scan correlated in 70% to 85% of stenoses of the internal or external carotid arteries near their origins. The technique may be performed by a well-trained technician or physician.
