The use of lower tourniquet inflation pressures in extremity surgery facilitated by curved and wide tourniquets and an integrated cuff inflation system. Use of the lowest possible cuff inflation pressure should minimize the pathogenic effects of compression beneath the pneumatic tourniquet. Curved tourniquets (designed to fit conically shaped limbs) and wider tourniquets were associated with significantly lower arterial occlusion pressure (AOP) than standard, straight tourniquets on the arms and legs of 26 normal volunteers. These tourniquets were used with an integrated tourniquet inflation system in 29 upper-extremity and 31 lower-extremity surgeries. Mean tourniquet inflation pressures of 183.7 mm Hg and 208 mm Hg were used during various surgical procedures of the arm and leg, respectively. Incomplete hemostasis was associated with elevated systolic blood pressure in several cases, but acceptable surgical hemostasis was achieved by incremental increase of the cuff inflation pressure. Curved cuffs, wide cuffs, and an integrated cuff inflation system should facilitate the use of lower tourniquet inflation pressures in extremity surgery.
