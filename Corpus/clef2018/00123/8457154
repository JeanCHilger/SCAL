Polytetrafluoroethylene grafts in infrainguinal arterial revascularization. Factors affecting outcome. One hundred thirty-seven polytetrafluoroethylene infrainguinal bypass grafts were performed over 2 years. The results were analyzed using univariate and multivariate analyses. Our operative mortality was 3.2% and the post-operative amputation rate was 5.8%. Forty-eight reconstructions were done for claudication, with a 5-year secondary patency rate of 64%, no early amputations, and a 2.9% (one limb) late amputation rate. Sixty-six reconstructions were done for rest pain with a 5-year secondary patency rate of 58% and a 3-year limb salvage rate of 77%. The 5-year secondary patency rate for 23 patients with trophic changes was 30%, and the 3-year limb salvage rate was 71%. Multivariate analysis identified the ankle-brachial index as the most important independent factor predicting both primary and secondary graft patency. The cumulative primary and secondary patency rates for patients with an ankle-brachial index of less than 0.5 at 78 months was 37% and 46%, respectively and 57% and 68%, respectively for patients with an ankle-brachial index of 0.5 or more.
