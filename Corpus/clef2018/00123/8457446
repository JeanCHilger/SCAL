A corticosteroid, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug and an antihistamine modulate in vivo vascular reactions before and during post-occlusive hyperaemia. Post-occlusive reactive hyperaemia is the temporary increase of blood flow in a tissue following transient vascular obstruction, and has recently been proposed as an in vivo method for ranking topical corticosteroid potency. We investigated in vivo vascular reactions before and during post-occlusive hyperaemia using laser-Doppler flowmetry and reflectance spectroscopy (RS). RS enables resolution of in vivo erythema into deoxygenated (venous) [DOH] and oxygenated (arterial) haemoglobin (OH) components (expressed in arbitrary units, AU). Using a randomized 24-h occlusive exposure in 10 healthy volunteers the effects of a corticosteroid (betamethasone-17-valerate), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) [indomethacin], an antihistamine (diphenhydramine), or vehicle, were studied before and during post-occlusive hyperaemia. The 24-h vehicle exposure decreased total haemoglobin (composed of a small increase in OH [P < 0.001] and a greater decrease in DOH [P < 0.005], [OH, 0.23 +/- 0.18 AU DOH, 0.28 +/- 0.12 AU]). The blood flow increased 7.1% to 28 +/- 8 AU (P > 0.05). Betamethasone-17-valerate exposure decreased total haemoglobin further (OH, 0.10 +/- 0.09 AU [P < 0.005]
