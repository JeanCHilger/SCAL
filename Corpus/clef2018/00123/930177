Comparative studies on the value of oscillography and venous occlusion plethysmography in the diagnosis of arterial occlusive diseases. Oscillography and plethysmography in phlebembraxis also occupy an important place in the screening of arterial obstructive diseases. The two methods give reliable results. In patients who have--as was established by oscillography and clinical examination--healthy vessels, as well as in patients with arterial obstructive disease in stage II a good correspondence with the findings of plethysmography in phlebembraxis could be proved, if all the three measuring sizes (first flow, peak flow and peak flow time) were taken into consideration. Hereby the normal values given partly deviate from those ones given in literature. They are guide values which in the individual case may fall below or transgressed also in patients with healthy vessels, whereby the peak flow time is to be regarded as the most reliable measuring size. On account of the slight expenditure of time the plethysmography in phlebembraxis is suitable as screening method, however it is not sufficient as the only method for the angiological prediagnostics. It is a valuable supplementation to the hitherto known unbloody examination methods.
