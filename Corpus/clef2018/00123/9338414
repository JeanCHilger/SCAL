Hemodynamic correlates of effective arterial elastance in mitral stenosis before and after balloon valvotomy. This study had the purpose of documenting the hemodynamic correlates of effective arterial elastance (Ea i.e., an accurate estimate of hydraulic load) in mitral stenosis (MS) patients. The main hypothesis tested was that Ea relates to the total vascular resistance (R)-to-pulse interval duration (T) ratio (R/T) in MS patients both before and after successful balloon mitral valvotomy (BMV). High-fidelity aortic pressure recordings were obtained in 10 patients (40 +/- 12 yr) before and 15 min after BMV. Ea value was calculated as the ratio of the steady-state end-systolic aortic pressure (ESAP) to stroke volume (thermodilution). Ea increased after BMV (from 1.55 +/- 0.63 to 1.83 +/- 0.71 mmHg/ml
