Is deep dorsal vein arterialization an alternative surgical approach to treat venogenic impotence? Several surgical techniques have been applied for the treatment of cavernosal venous leakage, sufficient enough to create erectile dysfunction. In light of the variable success rates, we report our experience with deep dorsal penile vein arterialization for the management of severe cavernosal venous leakage.Twenty-four impotent patients with venous leakage were treated by the Virag-II type of end-to-end anastomosis of the inferior epigastric artery to the deep dorsal penile vein and ligation of the vein proximally. Diagnostic evaluation included color flow Doppler sonography before and after intracavernous 60 mg papaverine injection and dynamic cavernosometry/ cavernosography, which indicated veno-occlusive dysfunction in 28 patients. Revascularization was technically possible in 24 of the patients, although in 4 anastomosis could not be achieved due to the poor quality of the inferior epigastric artery.Five patients had early occlusion in the immediate postoperative period and 4 had late occlusion within 8 months. Potency was improved initially in 9 (38%) of the 24 patients in whom successful anastomosis had been achieved, with longer term improvement in 6 (25%) of 24 who realized restoration of erectile potency as defined by clinical investigations. The mean follow-up was 24 months (range 3-36 months).We believe that anastomosis of the inferior epigastric artery to the deep dorsal penile vein and ligation of the vein proximally in cases of venous leakage results in a low success rate due probably to a pancavernosal alteration in corporal tissue compliance.
