Screening for carotid and renal artery stenoses in patients with aortoiliac disease. Patients with severe stenoses of the carotid and renal arteries define a population at high risk but most of them are asymptomatic. Here arises the question of who must be tested and what would be the actual utility of a screening program in the general or selected populations. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of a duplex-based screening for carotid and renal arteries stenoses, in a subset of patients with aortoiliac arterial disease, in terms of: (1) prevalence of occlusive disease of the carotid and renal arteries detected and surgical procedures generated (2) analysis of clinical variables that could be useful to increase the suspicion index for the disease
