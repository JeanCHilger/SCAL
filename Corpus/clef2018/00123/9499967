Study of atheromatous stenoses of carotid bifurcations by Doppler ultrasound, spiral angio-MRI, magnetic resonance angiography and comparison with arteriography. To evaluate Doppler ultrasound (US), Helical CT, Magnetic Resonance (MR) angiography in the detection of carotid bifurcation atherosclerotic disease and comparison with angiography.After a Doppler US procedure, 56 carotid bifurcations were included (symptomatic stenosis greater than 60% or asymptomatic stenosis greater than 30%). Helical CT, MR angiography and selective arteriography were performed. Stenosis were measured with NASCET criteria. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated and compared to arteriographics findings for each procedure and each grade of stenosis.Helical CT and MR angiography had their best sensitivity in grade 3 (70-99%), 92%, 100% respectively, their specificity was identical (91%). All the occlusions were depicted by the three procedures.Association of Doppler US and MR angiography may replace in the future selective angiography in the evaluation of extracranial atherosclerotic disease. Arteriography would be performed only in case of discordance between these two procedures.
