Intravascular stents in congenital heart disease: short- and long-term results from a large single-center experience. This report describes the results of the Food and Drug Administration's phase 1 and 2 clinical trials of intravascular stents at Texas Children's Hospital.Since the late 1980s, intravascular stent implantation for the treatment of arterial and venous stenoses in congenital heart disease has been highly successful.Stents were placed in postoperative pulmonary artery (PA) stenoses, congenital PA stenoses or stenoses of systemic veins/venous anastomoses. Prospective collection of data according to protocol was done before intervention, after stent implantation and at follow-up catheterization.At stent implantation, pressure gradients decreased significantly in all three groups (mean +/- SD): from 46 +/- 25 to 10 +/- 13 mm Hg in postoperative PA stenoses (p < 0.001) from 71 +/- 45 to 15 +/- 21 mm Hg in congenital PA stenoses (p < 0.001)Intravascular stents for the treatment of vascular stenoses in congenital heart disease provide excellent immediate and long-term results.
