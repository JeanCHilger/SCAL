Pseudoaneurysm with associated arteriovenous fistula after transfemoral puncture. Local vascular complications after transfemoral cardiac catheterization occur with an incidence of 5%. Most commonly these lesions are pseudoaneurysms, av-fistulas, arterial dissections or direct vascular injuries. Undiagnosed vascular lesions can lead to fatal consequences especially in patients with chronic heart failure by av-fistula with significant shunt volume.We report a vascular complication of combined pseudoaneurysm and av-fistula originated from the pseudoaneurysm. The lesion was diagnosed by color Doppler ultrasound.The suspicion of a vascular lesion after vascular catheterization should immediately lead to color Doppler ultrasound. Noninvasive duplexsonography will lead to early diagnosis of vascular complications and prompt further surgical or conservative intervention with reduction of long-term sequela and morbidity.
