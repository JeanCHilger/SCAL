Doppler tissue imaging quantitates regional wall motion during myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. Quantification of regional myocardial function is a major unresolved issue in cardiology. We evaluated the accuracy of pulsed Doppler tissue imaging (DTI), a new echocardiographic technique, to quantify regional myocardial dysfunction induced by acute ischemia and reperfusion.In nine open-chest anesthetized pigs, various degrees of regional wall motion abnormalities were induced by graded reduction of left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) blood flow. Pulsed Doppler tissue imaging was performed from an epicardial apical four-chamber view with the sample placed within the middle part of the septal wall. Peak septal velocities were calculated during systole, isovolumic relaxation, and early and late diastole. Regional myocardial blood flow and systolic and diastolic dysfunctions were assessed by radioactive microspheres and ultrasonic crystals, respectively. Ischemia resulted in a significant rapid reduction of systolic velocities and an early decrease in the ratio of early to late diastolic velocities. Both changes were detected by pulsed DTI within 5 seconds of coronary artery occlusion. The decrease in systolic velocity significantly correlated with both systolic shortening (r=.90, P<.0001) and regional myocardial blood flow (r=.96, P<.0001) during reduction of LAD blood flow.These results suggest that DTI may be a promising new tool for the quantification of ischemia-induced regional myocardial dysfunction.
