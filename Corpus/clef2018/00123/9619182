Combination endovascular and open treatment of peripheral arterial occlusive disease performed by surgeons. The endovascular treatment of peripheral arterial occlusive disease has historically been performed by interventional radiologists and cardiologists. With additional training in endovascular techniques, surgeons become uniquely suited to manage arterial lesions with both endovascular and conventional surgical techniques.
