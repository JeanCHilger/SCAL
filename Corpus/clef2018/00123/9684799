Correlates of antithrombin, protein C, protein S, and TFPI in a healthy elderly cohort. The majority of fatal acute myocardial infarctions occur in the elderly. Since these events are predominantly thrombotic, we studied the cross-sectional associations of the anticoagulant proteins Antithrombin, Protein C, Protein S. and Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI) in a subgroup (n = 400) of the Cardiovascular Health Study (a study of healthy men and women > or = 65 years) free of clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD). We did not observe any strong age-associated trends, although Protein C was lower in older women (p < or = 0.001), and TFPI was higher in older men (p < or = 0.01). The inhibitors were highly intercorrelated, and were associated with increased levels of inflammation-sensitive proteins (e.g., fibrinogen. plasminogen), lipids (especially total and LDL-cholesterol), and coagulation factors, such as Factors VIIc, IXc, and Xc. None was associated with the procoagulant markers Prothrombin Fragment F1-2 or Fibrinopeptide A. Only TFPI was associated with subclinical atherosclerosis: ankle-arm index and internal carotid artery stenosis, p trend < or = 0.01 and carotid wall thickness, p trend < or = 0.05. In multivariate analysis the independent predictors of TFPI were levels of fibrinogen
