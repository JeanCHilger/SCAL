Intraoperative Doppler ultrasound in liver transplantation. The purpose of this study was to determine the utility of intraoperative Doppler ultrasound for the diagnosis and reduction of the vascular complications in liver transplantation. This study included 19 pediatric and 5 adult patients. In the pediatric group, 12 patients received living related liver transplantation (LRLT), two splitting liver transplantation (SLT), three reduced-size liver transplantation (RLT) and two full-size pediatric liver transplants (FPLT). The hemodynamics and waveform of the hepatic vein, portal vein and hepatic artery were evaluated by intraoperative Doppler ultrasound (US) after reperfusion of the graft. Unsatisfactory hemodynamics was identified in nine cases, including decrease hepatic venous flow (6-9 cm/s) with non-pulsative flat waveform (adults, n = 2 and LRLT, n = 2) portal vein thrombosis (LRLT, n = 1)
