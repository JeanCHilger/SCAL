Correlation of flow velocity measurements by magnetic resonance phase contrast imaging and intravascular Doppler ultrasound. The authors compare the magnetic resonance (MR) phase contrast flow velocity measurements in varying concentric stenoses with invasive measurements obtained with a Doppler guidewire.Flow velocity measurements were obtained using a calibrated 0.018 inch 12 MHz Doppler guidewire and a 1.0 T MR imaging system in a pulsatile hydraulic model with variable arterial stenoses. Velocity measurements were performed proximal, intrastenotic, and distal to the stenoses. The cross-sectional area of stenosis was calculated from the data of both methods. For MR imaging measurements, fast low-angle shot two-dimensional phase contrast sequences with different velocity encodings were used.Phase contrast flow measurements correlated well (r = 0.95, Pearson) with Doppler guidewire-based flow velocity data. Generally, flow velocities obtained with MR imaging were lower when compared with the Doppler-based data (P < or = 0.001, Wilcoxon matched pairs test). However, the ratios and the calculated cross-sectional area of stenoses showed a high correlation (r = 0.96) with the predefined area of stenoses.The assessment of flow alterations in vitro due to variable stenoses using MR phase contrast flow measurements is very well correlated with the Doppler guidewire. Consequently, these results required in vivo measurements of atherosclerotic lesions to evaluate the clinical impact.
