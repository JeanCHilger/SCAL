Limb capillary filtration coefficient in human subjects: the importance of the site of measurement. Capillary filtration coefficient is a critical determinant of fluid flux across the microvascular wall. Changes in capillary filtration coefficient have been described in a number of disease processes. Measurement is typically made by venous occlusion plethysmography using either the upper or lower limb, but a variety of measurement protocols have been used and the importance of the site of measurement remains unclear. In this study, forearm and calf capillary filtration coefficient were measured in healthy volunteers, either simultaneously (group A n = 11) or sequentially in random order (group B
