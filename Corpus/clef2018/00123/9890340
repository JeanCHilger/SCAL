Ultrasound-Doppler technique for monitoring blood flow in the brachial artery compared with occlusion plethysmography of the forearm. Blood flow changes in the brachial artery of seven subjects during and after submaximal static handgrip contractions were measured by duplex Doppler ultrasound technique. These measurements were compared with the results of occlusion plethysmography, measured immediately (2-3 heartbeats) after. For the combined data from all measurements, a common calibration line could be drawn (linear regression, r=0.92). The flow measurements from the two methods were tested by a four-way analysis of variance and there was no significant difference between the methods during (static) exercise, indicating acceptable coherence. Occlusion plethysmography may well be used for monitoring forearm blood flow during conditions of static exercise. In addition, the cuff occlusion pressure of the plethysmograph (50 mmHg) decreased the blood flow of the brachial artery by approximately 28% as measured by duplex Doppler ultrasound.
