Outcome of femoropopliteal angioplasty. To assess prospectively the outcome of femoropopliteal angioplasty and investigate prognostic indicators of success.Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty is commonly used to treat symptomatic femoropopliteal stenoses or occlusions, but the durability of the procedure is uncertain.Seventy-four consecutive patients treated by femoropopliteal angioplasty for intermittent claudication (43), rest pain (4), and tissue loss (27) were followed by assessment of symptoms, ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) to measure hemodynamic outcome, and duplex monitoring of velocity gradient at the angioplasty site to identify restenosis at 1 day and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Univariate comparisons, life table analysis, and backward stepwise regression were used to investigate factors predicting the symptomatic and hemodynamic outcome and restenosis.Technical success was obtained in 67 patients (91%) failure occurred in 7 patients. At 1 year, a successful symptomatic outcome was achieved in 35 patients (51%), hemodynamic success was achieved in 41 patients (58%), and restenosis developed in 39%. ABPI at 24 hours after angioplasty was the most significant variable predicting a symptomatic outcome, hemodynamic outcome, and restenosis at 12 months. Life table analysis demonstrated that in 24% of patients with a 24-hour ABPI > or =0.9, restenosis developed by 12 months, compared with 64% of patients with a 24-hour ABPI <0.9.Only half of the patients treated by femoropopliteal angioplasty had symptomatic improvement at 1 year, raising concern about the cost-benefit ratio of this procedure. Restoration of ABPI to >0.9 predicted a favorable outcome.
