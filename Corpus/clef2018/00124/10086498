Cerebrovascular reactivity before and after carotid endarterectomy. The hemodynamic relevance of internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis often does not correlate with anatomic features, as angiographically defined. The cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) has been advocated as a means of defining the cerebral hemodynamic impairment.We assessed the results of pre- and postoperative CVR evaluation, using the CO2 transcranial doppler method, in 25 patients with high-grade ICA stenosis. The patients with history of stroke, evidence of cerebral CT infarction or symptoms from the contralateral circulation or the brain stem were excluded to avoid the effects of cerebral infarction on the hemodynamic studies. Statistical analysis was used to evaluate the CVR changes after carotid endarterectomy.Preoperative evaluation showed that CVR was generally well correlated with the degree of ICA stenosis and concomitant contralateral carotid steno-occlusion. Before endarterectomy the mean CVR value was 66.5% (moderately reduced). After surgery the overall mean value of CVR was 84.1% (normal), with a statistically significant improvement.The results of this study suggest that the CVR evaluation allows one to obtain hemodynamic information of clinical interest in the patients with ICA stenosis and that carotid endarterectomy is effective to restore the CVR in patients with cerebral hemodynamic impairment.
