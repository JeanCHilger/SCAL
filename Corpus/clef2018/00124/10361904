Adenosine 5'-triphosphate induced dilation of human coronary microvessels in vivo. This study was performed to compare the coronary microvascular response to adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) with the response to adenosine in humans.Coronary blood flow velocity was determined using a Doppler flow wire. After intracoronary nitroglycerin infusion, intracoronary bolus injections of adenosine (20 microg) and ATP (20 microg) were performed to induce reactive hyperemia.Twenty-nine patients (23 men and 6 women, mean age: 63+/-9 years) with coronary artery disease and risk factors for coronary atherosclerosis were studied.Coronary flow reserve in response to ATP was similar to that for adenosine (2.7+/-0.7 vs. 2.7+/-0.7). However, the duration of ATP-induced vasodilation was longer than that of adenosine-induced dilation (39+/-25 seconds vs. 26+/-12 seconds, p<0.0001). The coronary flow reserve obtained with either ATP or adenosine was significantly reduced in the interventioned arteries compared with non-stenosed arteries. The coronary flow reserve obtained with ATP was similar to that obtained with adenosine in both artery groups. The duration of the vasodilator effect of ATP was significantly greater than that of adenosine in both artery groups.These results suggest that ATP induces maximal dilation of coronary microvessels, most likely through an endothelium-independent mechanism. The degradation of ATP to adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) and adenosine, as well as the direct action of ATP on A2-adenosine receptors may be responsible for the dilation. We conclude that coronary flow reserve can be determined safely with intracoronary ATP administration.
