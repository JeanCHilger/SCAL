Raynaud's syndrome in workers who use vibrating pneumatic air knives. The use of vibrating tools has been shown to cause Raynaud's syndrome (RS) in a variety of workers, including those who use chain saws, chippers, and grinders. The diagnosis of RS in workers who use vibrating tools is difficult to document objectively. We studied a patient cohort with RS caused by the use of a vibrating pneumatic air knife (PAK) for removal of automobile windshields and determined our ability to document RS in these workers by means of digital hypothermic challenge testing (DHCT), a vascular laboratory study that evaluates digital blood pressure response to cooling.Sixteen male autoglass workers (mean age, 36 years) with RS were examined by means of history, physical examination, arm blood pressures, digital photoplethysmography, screening serologic studies for underlying connective tissue disorder, and DHCT.No patient had RS before they used a PAK. The mean onset of RS (color changes, 100% pain, 93%PAK use is a possible cause of vibration-induced RS. The presence of RS in workers who use the PAK was objectively confirmed by means of DHCT. Cessation of PAK use in the short term did not result in symptomatic improvement.
