MRA contrast bolus timing with ultrasound bubbles. The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of using an ultrasound contrast agent test bolus to determine optimum bolus timing for three-dimensional (3D) gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Small test doses of ultrasound contrast agent (0.3 ml Optison) were injected intravenously followed immediately by a 20 ml saline flush. Arrival of the contrast agent was detected by spectral Doppler ultrasound (US). This technique was implemented in patients undergoing peripheral vascular MRA and carotid MRA. Arrival of the US contrast agent test bolus was readily detected by the change in amplitude of the Doppler spectrum and by a huge increase in the audio signal amplitude. This contrast travel time measurement accurately guided bolus timing for 3D Gd MRA. Bolus timing for 3D contrast-enhanced MRA can be performed using US, thereby eliminating the problems and MR scanner time required for injecting a test bolus of Gd contrast.
