Radiographic characteristics of Cook detachable and Gianturco coils as well as clinical results of transcatheter closure of the patent ductus arteriosus. To describe the radiographic appearance of the Gianturco and the Cook detachable coils and present the clinical results in patients who underwent transcatheter closure of patent ductus arteriosus.Between January 1994 and June 1997, eighty-two patients underwent closure of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) using either Gianturco or Cook detachable coils. The chest x-ray and echocardiography of all patients were reviewed and the following parameters were evaluated: 1) the size of the heart (cardiothoracic ratio), 2) the position and the type of the coils in the postero-anterior and the lateral projection, 3) the number of coils used, 4) the existence of residual ductal flow, 5) Doppler velocity in the left pulmonary artery.Complete occlusion was achieved in 94%, and cardio-thoracic ratio regressed from 0.57 to 0.53 (p < 0.01), after a mean follow-up of 1.2 years. The identification of the different coils on the chest radiograph was successful in only 47% of cases, difficulties arising especially, when multiple coils were used. In 55 patients (67%) the coil position was judged to be optimal, in 27 patients (33%) suboptimal. The latter correlates with the presence of residual shunt. Multiple coils correlated more with a left pulmonary artery flow velocity exceeding 1.5 m/s.Coil-occlusion of patent ductus arteriosus is effective and leads to reduced cardio-thoracic ratio. Radiographic coil identification is possible but may be difficult if multiple coils are deployed. Suboptimal coil position led more often to residual PDA shunt. Multiple coils are more commonly associated with increased LPA velocities, but hemodynamic significant obstruction to flow is rare.
