Methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and nitric oxide synthase (ecNOS) genes and risks of peripheral arterial disease and coronary heart disease: Edinburgh Artery Study. Hyperhomocysteinaemia and reduced nitric oxide synthesis may each result in endothelial dysfunction predisposing to atherogenesis. Genetic variants of methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (ecNOS) influence homocysteine metabolism and nitric oxide synthesis, respectively and might thus be determinants of the risk of atherosclerotic disease. The aim of our study was to identify, in a general population sample, the risks of peripheral arterial disease and of coronary heart disease related to MTHFR (175198) and ecNOS (4
