Abnormal venous function in patients with homozygous sickle cell (SS) disease and chronic leg ulcers. Chronic leg ulceration is a major cause of morbidity in homozygous sickle cell (SS) disease in Jamaica. These ulcers have features in common with venous ulcers in patients with a normal haemoglobin genotype (AA). Thus we sought to determine whether there is abnormal venous function in the legs of patients with SS disease who have ulcers. Experiments were performed on 15 SS patients with ulcers, and on 15 SS patients and 15 AA subjects with no history of leg ulcers. Changes in venous blood volume of the bottom one-third of the leg induced by venous occlusion and release were studied by air plethysmography, providing indices of segmental venous capacitance (SVC), maximal venous outflow (MVO) and venous emptying time (VET). The changes in volume (ambulatory volume change AVC) induced by a period of leg exercise were also measured at the ankle (AVCa) and calf (AVCc)
