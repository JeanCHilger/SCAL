Revascularization of femoropopliteal artery occlusion in Werner's syndrome. Report of a case and review of surgical literature in cardiovascular lesions. A patient with Werner's syndrome suffering from a chronic ulcer on the right ankle joint underwent femoropopliteal bypass and patch angioplasty combined with endarterectomy of the distal popliteal artery. Postoperative angiography showed satisfactory graft patency and distal run-off, and the ulcer improved. Femoropopliteal occlusive disease in Werner's syndrome tends to have poor run-off and the internal diameter of the popliteal artery with diffuse arteriosclerotic lesion is often too small to facilitate distal anastomosis. Therefore, a conventional bypass procedure is not always effective and an aggressive attitude is essential to obtain sufficient ankle blood pressure and improve the leg ulcer in Werner' syndrome.
