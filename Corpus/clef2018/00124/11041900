Determinants of peripheral arterial disease in the elderly: the Rotterdam study. To examine which atherosclerotic risk factors are determinants for peripheral arterial disease (PAD), we performed a population-based study in 6450 subjects (40% men, 60% women) aged 55 years and older.The presence of PAD was assessed by measuring the ankle-arm systolic blood pressure index (AAI) PAD was considered present if the AAI was lower than 0.90 in either leg. In addition, a threshold AAI of 0.70 in either leg defined severe PAD.Determinants strongly and independently associated with PAD were age of at least 75 years (odds ratio [OR], 1.2 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-1.6), fibrinogen level (OR, 1.5Assessment of a wide range of atherosclerotic risk factors enabled us to quantify the relative importance of each factor as determinant for PAD. In total, 69% of the occurrence of PAD is attributable to cardiovascular risk factors measured in our study smoking accounted for most (etiologic fraction, 18.1%). The results suggest that preventive management of PAD should be directed at systolic blood pressure, fibrinogen level, smoking, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, and diabetes mellitus.
