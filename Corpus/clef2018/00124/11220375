Effect of carotid endarterectomy on chronic ocular ischemic syndrome due to internal carotid artery stenosis. We evaluated the effect of carotid endarterectomy on chronic ocular ischemic syndrome due to internal carotid artery stenosis by use of data obtained from ophthalmic artery color Doppler flow imaging.We examined 11 patients with ocular ischemic syndrome due to internal carotid artery stenosis (>70% stenosis) who were being treated by carotid endarterectomy. Ophthalmic artery color Doppler flow imaging indicated ophthalmic artery flow direction and peak systolic flow velocity and was performed before and at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after surgery.We assessed the ophthalmic arteries of 11 patients via color Doppler flow imaging. Before undergoing carotid endarterectomy, five patients showed reversed ophthalmic artery flow. In the other six patients who experienced antegrade ophthalmic artery flow, the average peak systolic flow velocity was 0.09 +/- 0.05 m/s (mean +/- standard deviation). Preoperative reversed flow resolved in each patient 1 week after undergoing surgery. All patients showed antegrade ophthalmic artery flow. The average peak systolic flow velocity in the patients who had preoperative antegrade flow rose significantly, to 0.21 +/- 0.14 m/s (P < 0.05). There was no significant change as compared with findings at 1 week after surgery. During the follow-up period (mean, 32.4 mo), no patients complained of recurrent visual symptoms. At the end of the study period, visual acuity had improved in five patients and had not worsened in the other six patients.Carotid endarterectomy was effective for improving or preventing the progress of chronic ocular ischemia caused by internal carotid artery stenosis.
