Duplex criteria for determination of 50% or greater carotid stenosis. Recently the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial investigators reported a benefit of carotid endarterectomy compared with medical therapy for symptomatic patients with 50% or greater carotid stenosis. This has necessitated the development of screening parameters for diagnosis of 50% or greater carotid stenosis on the basis of the reference standards used in the study by the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial. The duplex scans and arteriograms of 110 patients (210 carotid arteries) were reviewed by blinded readers. Duplex measurements of peak systolic velocity and end diastolic velocity were recorded, and the ratio of these velocities in the internal and common carotid arteries was calculated. The criteria determined for detection of 50% or greater stenosis were as follows: peak systolic velocity of the internal carotid artery greater than 170 cm/s (sensitivity, 92% specificity, 90%
