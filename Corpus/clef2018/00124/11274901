Identification of patients at risk for diabetic foot: a comparison of standardized noninvasive testing with routine practice at community diabetes clinics. The aim of the study was the comparison of a simple standardized noninvasive examination of neuropathy and angiopathy with routine diagnostic practice in community diabetes clinics for the identification of patients at risk of foot ulceration. Consecutive patients (n=322), aged 30 years and more, with a diabetes duration of more than 5 years, were examined by trained podiatric nurses in six diabetes clinics over a 1-year period 44 of these patients had active or previous foot ulcerations. We evaluated the differences between the routine diagnostic practice (based on the patient's medical history and a physical examination) and noninvasive testing of peripheral neuropathy [vibration perception threshold (VPT) and the Semmes-Weinstein 10-g monofilament wire system] and angiopathy [Doppler ankle/brachial index (ABI)]. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, we evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of noninvasive testing methods for identifying patients at risk and selecting the optimal diagnostic cutoff points. Patients with severe neuropathy, as determined by noninvasive testing (VPT > or =30 V and/or insensitivity to 10 g monofilament), had been diagnosed to have neuropathy in diabetes clinics in 54% of cases. Patients with angiopathy at risk of developing diabetic foot ulcers (ABI < or =0.8) had been diagnosed, in diabetes clinics, to have peripheral arterial disease in 50% (they reported claudications in 41%, had femoral artery bruits detected in 29% and nonpalpable peripheral pulsations in 12%). Our findings stress the importance of using standardized simple noninvasive testing methods to increase the accuracy of identifying patients at risk for the diabetic foot at the community level.
