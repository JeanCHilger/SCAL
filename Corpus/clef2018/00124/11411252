Recording of short-term finger blood pressure changes induced by an arterial occlusive thigh cuff: comparison between the modified oscillometric and Finapres techniques. Blood pressure recordings obtained by the volume clamp method (Finapres monitor, Ohmeda, USA) were compared with measurements by using a novel modification of the oscillometric method (UT9201 beat-to-beat monitor, University of Tartu, Estonia). Step changes in total peripheral resistance were introduced in 11 healthy volunteers by rapid inflation to the suprasystolic pressure of bilateral thigh cuffs during a rhythmical exercise with the quadriceps muscles and simultaneously performed handgrip compression. The provoked short-term changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) were similarly tracked by both devices. The agreement between the methods was better for MAP rise than drop. The group-averaged difference UT9201 minus Finapres did not exceed 1.2 mmHg (NS, p = 0.46) after cuff successive inflation but yielded 3.8 mmHg (significant, p < 0.05) after cuff successive deflation.
