Late systolic wave on brachial artery blood flow velocity pattern in patients with coronary artery disease and its relation to vascular stiffness. Duplex-Doppler study typically exhibits triphasic brachial artery blood flow velocity pattern in subjects classified as normal without clinically evident atherosclerotic complications, heart disease, hypertension, or diabetes mellitus. In this study, the authors described the late systolic wave on the brachial artery blood flow velocity pattern in patients with coronary artery disease and investigated the relation between late systolic wave and vascular stiffness. Blood flow profile and velocity of the brachial artery were determined noninvasively by ultrasound pulsed-Doppler technique under the guidance of a B-mode ultrasound image in 96 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). The control group consisted of 23 healthy subjects with no or maximally 2 risk factors (only among age, cigarette smoking, obesity, and gender) for vascular disease. None of the patients and controls had clinical evidence of arterial disorders at upper extremities. In 32 patients (33%) with CAD, a late systolic wave was observed in the brachial artery Doppler study. On the other hand, no late systolic wave was observed in the healthy subjects. In addition, multivessel disease, hypertension, advanced age, diabetes, and smoking were significantly more frequent in patients with the late systolic wave. In conclusion, peripheral arterial abnormalities induced by vascular stiffness may produce alterations in regional wave reflections, and the normal triphasic pattern of the brachial artery blood flow may change by the appearance of the late systolic wave.
