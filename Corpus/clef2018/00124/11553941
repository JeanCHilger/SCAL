Angiographic prevalence and clinical predictors of left subclavian stenosis in patients undergoing diagnostic cardiac catheterization. The angiographic prevalence, clinical predictors, and sensitivity and specificity of a bilateral arm blood pressure differential for predicting proximal left subclavian artery stenosis were established in 492 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization. Seventeen subjects (3.5%) in the overall population and nine subjects (5.3%) with potential surgical coronary disease had proximal left subclavian stenosis. Precatheterization evidence of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) was the only predictor of subclavian stenosis in the overall population (P < 0.001 OR = 7.9
