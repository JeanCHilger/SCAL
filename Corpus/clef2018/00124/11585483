Leg symptoms in peripheral arterial disease: associated clinical characteristics and functional impairment. Persons with lower-extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD) are often asymptomatic or have leg symptoms other than intermittent claudication (IC).To identify clinical characteristics and functional limitations associated with a broad range of leg symptoms identified among patients with PAD.Cross-sectional study of 460 men and women with PAD and 130 without PAD, who were identified consecutively, conducted between October 1998 and January 2000 at 3 Chicago-area medical centers.Ankle-brachial index score of less than 0.90 scores from 6-minute walk, accelerometer-measured physical activity over 7 days, repeated chair raises, standing balance (full tandem stand), 4-m walking velocity, San Diego claudication questionnaire, Geriatric Depression Score Short-Form, and the Walking Impairment Questionnaire.All groups with PAD had poorer functioning than participants without PAD. The following values are for patients without IC vs those with IC. Participants in the group with leg pain on exertion and rest (n = 88) had a higher (poorer) score for neuropathy (5.6 vs 3.5 P<.001), prevalence of diabetes mellitus (48.9% vs 26.7%There is a wide range of leg symptoms in persons with PAD beyond that of classic IC. Comorbid disease may contribute to these symptoms in PAD. Functional impairments are found in every PAD symptom group, and the degree of functional limitation varies depending on the type of leg symptom.
