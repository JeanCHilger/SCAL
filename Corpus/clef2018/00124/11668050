eNOS 894T allele and coronary blood flow at rest and during adenosine-induced hyperemia. The 894T allele of a G894T polymorphism in the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene is associated with decreased eNOS activity, cleavage of the protein, and endothelial dysfunction. The present study evaluated the association with coronary blood flow (CBF) at rest and during adenosine (ADO)-induced hyperemia. CBF was determined by Doppler flow wire and angiography in 97 left anterior descending arteries of individuals without coronary artery disease. At rest, average peak velocity (APV) was lower and coronary vascular resistance (CVR) was higher in homozygous carriers of the 894T allele than in heterozygotes and individuals without the 894T allele. CBF tended to be lower in eNOS 894T allele carriers. During ADO-induced hyperemia (18 microg ic), APV, CVR, and CBF were not statistically different between the genotypes. The reduced APV at rest in conjunction with an increased CVR indicates a vasomotor dysfunction related to an increased microvascular resting tone in eNOS 894T allele carriers.
