Intracranial aneurysms: experience in treating 500 patients. To summarize the experience in surgical treatment of patients with intracranial aneurysms.The measures used in the treatment of 500 patients with intracranial aneurysms were retrospectively reviewed with regard to timing of surgery, induced-hypotensive anesthesia, brain protection combined with temporal occlusion of the feeding artery, dynamically monitoring of transcranial Doppler ultrasound, antivasospasm treatment, techniques of direct surgery, and endovascular embolization.In 465 patients undergoing surgery, intraoperative rupture was observed in 27(6.2%), postoperative death in 13 (2.7%), hemipalsy in 8(2.2%), and vegetative state in 2 (5.0%). The operative mortality was 3.8% in 210 patients before 1990, while 1.9% in 255 patients after 1990.The outcome of patients with intracranial aneurysms can be markedly improved by comprehensive measures.
