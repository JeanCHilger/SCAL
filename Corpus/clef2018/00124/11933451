When is reduced-compression bandaging safe and effective? During a one-year period 44 patients were treated with reduced-compression bandaging in the vascular unit at a district general hospital. Twenty patients with venous ulcers were referred from community leg ulcer clinics because they could not tolerate standard compression bandaging (group 1). A further 24 patients had mixed aetiology leg ulcers (group 2), and high-compression bandaging was not attempted because of significant peripheral vascular disease (ankle brachial pressure index < 0.8). Forty-two patients tolerated reduced-compression bandaging without discomfort or skin pressure changes. Healing was achieved in 32 patients (13 in group 1 and 19 in group 2). All non-healed ulcers were considered smaller at the time of final follow-up, and had less exudate. Reduced-compression bandaging has been shown to be effective and well tolerated by patients with venous ulcers who cannot comply with high-compression bandaging. With close supervision, it is safe to use in patients with significant peripheral vascular disease.
