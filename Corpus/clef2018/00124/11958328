Long-term results of stenting for chronic iliac artery occlusion. To evaluate the long-term results of stent placement for chronic occlusions of the iliac arteries.Between October 1992 and December 1997, 73 patients (40 men median age 64 years, range 42-89) with 76 occluded iliac arteries (33 common, 34 external, and 9 both vessels) were treated with percutaneous recanalization and stenting using a variety of self-expanding and balloon-expandable devices. Median occlusion length was 7 cm (range 1-14). Follow-up consisted of clinical assessment, ankle-brachial index measurement, and arteriography or duplex ultrasound when indicated.Anatomical success was achieved in 74 (97%) limbs. Seven (10%) patients experienced major complications: 2 distal embolizations, 2 arterial ruptures, 1 myocardial infarction, 1 groin hematoma requiring surgery, and 1 contrast-induced nephropathy. There was no 30-day mortality. Over a median follow-up of 27 months (range 1-75), there was 1 early occlusion (< or = 30 days) and 16 late recurrent lesions (11 occlusions and 5 stenoses) at a median 6.2 months (range 1.4-30). The recurrent lesions were treated with endovascular techniques in 8 limbs and surgery in 7 limbs (5 after failed endovascular procedures) 1 patient died before retreatment, and 1 patient refrained from further intervention. Primary and secondary patencies were 79% and 87% at 1 year and 69% and 81% at 3 years, respectively.Stenting of chronic iliac occlusions is a safe and durable alternative to surgical treatment.
