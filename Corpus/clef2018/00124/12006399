Inflammatory mediators and cell adhesion molecules as indicators of severity of atherosclerosis: the Rotterdam Study. Inflammatory mediators and soluble cell adhesion molecules predict cardiovascular events. It is not clear whether they reflect the severity of underlying atherosclerotic disease. Within the Rotterdam Study, we investigated the associations of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 with noninvasive measures of atherosclerosis. Levels of CRP were assessed in a random sample of 1317 participants, and levels of IL-6 and soluble cell adhesion molecules were assessed in a subsample of 714 participants. In multivariate analyses, logarithmically transformed CRP (regression coefficient [beta]=-0.023, 95% CI -0.033 to -0.012) and IL-6 (beta=-0.025, 95% CI -0.049 to -0.001) were inversely associated with the ankle-arm index. Only CRP was associated with carotid intima-media thickness (beta=0.018, 95% CI 0.010 to 0.027). Compared with the lowest tertile, the odds ratio for moderate to severe carotid plaques associated with levels of CRP in the highest tertile was 2.0 (95% CI 1.3 to 3.0). Soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 levels were strongly associated with carotid plaques (odds ratio 2.5, 95% CI 1.5 to 4.4 [highest versus lowest tertile]). Soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 was not significantly associated with any of the measures of atherosclerosis. This study indicates that CRP is associated with the severity of atherosclerosis measured at various sites. Associations of the other markers with atherosclerosis were less consistent.
