Assessing cardiovascular functioning in older people. The cardiovascular system comprises the heart and blood vessels. The heart circulates the blood through the vascular system to supply oxygen and nutrients to the peripheral tissues and remove carbon dioxide and other waste products. The blood has other functions such as distributing heat around the body and fighting infection. With the cardiovascular system it is difficult to separate the effects of normal ageing from disease processes (Watson 2000a). However, the process of atherosclerosis is almost universal in older people and is largely responsible for the higher prevalence of cardiovascular problems in older people (Hall et al 1993).
