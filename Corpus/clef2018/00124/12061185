Ankle pressure as an indicator of risk for systemic atherosclerosis. Contemporary methods of assessment of possible cardiovascular disease based on traditional risk factors are not perfect. Therefore new ways are sought. Simple and cheap methods include assessment of the blood pressure on the lower extremities above the ankles. The finding of a reduced index of ankle pressure (ratio of blood pressure above the ankles and pressure on the arm) indicates affection of the arteries of the lower extremities and a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (in particular myocardial infarction and stroke), independently on other risk factors. Therefore this simple examination should be made in middle aged and elderly subjects with a medium and high cardiovascular risk in order to define more accurately the health status, and in case of a reduced ankle pressure similar provisions should be made as in patients with secondary preventive care.
