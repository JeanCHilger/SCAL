A prospective comparison of pedal ergometry with conventional treadmill testing in the investigation of lower extremity pain. Investigation of lower extremity pain is compromised by comorbid disorders that may interfere with conventional testing.To compare pedal ergometry with conventional treadmill testing.A prospective study was performed where patients presenting with a diagnosis of intermittent claudication were assessed by both methods of testing.Of 78 patients studied with both tests, no exercise-induced ankle pressure changes occurred in 26, two were unable to complete either test despite normal pressure measurements, while 24 had exercise-induced pressure drop detected by both tests. Of patients who completed pedal ergometry, 21 were unable to complete the treadmill test, 14 of whom had negative ergometry, while seven had a pressure drop detected by pedal ergometry. Three had pressure changes with pedal ergometry, but not with treadmill testing and two had pressure changes on the treadmill not reproduced by pedal ergometry.Pedal ergometer is more sensitive than treadmill testing in detecting arterial insufficiency, as indicated by a 20% or greater fall in ankle pressure, and more suitable in a subgroup of patients unable to tolerate conventional treadmill testing.
