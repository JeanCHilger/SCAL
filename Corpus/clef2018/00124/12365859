An overview on peripheral vascular disease in blackfoot disease-hyperendemic villages in Taiwan. The arsenic-related peripheral vascular disease found to be endemic along the southwestern coast of Taiwan is reviewed. In the early 20th century a strange disease involving the lower extremities characterized by typical clinical symptoms and signs of progressive arterial occlusion was reported in a confined area located along the southwestern coast of Taiwan. The disease was locally called "blackfoot disease" because of its gangrenous appearance involving the feet of the patients. The prevalence of this disease ranged from 6.51 to 18.85 per 1,000 population in different villages. Epidemiologic studies revealed that blackfoot disease was associated with the consumption of artesian well water containing high levels of arsenic. High co-occurrence of blackfoot disease and arsenic-related skin lesions such as hyperpigmentation, hyperkeratosis, and skin cancer was also observed. Recent studies also confirmed the association of preclinical peripheral vascular disease with arsenic exposure in a dose-response pattern. Subclinical arterial insufficiency and defects in cutaneous microcirculation can also be demonstrated in seemingly normal subjects living in the endemic villages. The incidence of clinical manifestation of blackfoot disease decreased dramatically after the implementation of tap water in these villages over the past 2-3 decades. The atherogenicity of arsenic could be associated with its effects on hypercoagulability, endothelial injury, smooth muscle cell proliferation, somatic mutation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. However, its interaction with some trace elements and its association with hypertension and diabetes mellitus could also explain part of its higher risk of developing atherosclerosis.
