Lack of association between angiotensin-converting enzyme gene polymorphism and peripheral vascular disease in type 2 diabetic patients in Taiwan. A total of 361 Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes were studied for the association between peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and the insertion/deletion polymorphism involving a 287-bp alu repeat sequence at intron 16 of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene. The patients were divided into PVD (+) (n=45) and PVD (-) (n=316) based on an ankle-brachial index <0.9 and > or =0.9, respectively. Polymerase chain reaction was used to identify gene polymorphism. Results showed that D allele frequency in the patients without and with PVD was 31.8% and 33.3%, respectively (p=NS). The prevalence rates of II, ID and DD genotypes in the PVD (-) group were 45.6%, 45.3% and 9.2%, respectively and the respective values for the PVD (+) group were 44.4%, 44.4% and 11.1% (p=NS). Prevalence rates of PVD in genotypes II, ID, and DD were 12.2%, 12.3% and 14.7%, respectively (p=NS). In logistic regression analyses, the unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios for DD vs II and ID vs II genotypes for PVD were not statistically significant. The respective adjusted odds ratios were 1.88 (0.56-6.29) and 1.33 (0.63-2.80). In conclusion, there was not a significant association between the ACE genotype and PVD in Chinese type 2 diabetic patients. However, a type 2 error can not be ruled out.
