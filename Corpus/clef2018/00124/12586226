Intramuscular vascular endothelial growth factor gene therapy in patients with chronic critical leg ischemia. We sought to investigate the safety and efficacy of intramuscular gene therapy with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in patients with chronic critical leg ischemia.Gene transfer was performed in 24 limbs of 21 patients with rest pain, some of whom also had nonhealing ischemic ulcers (n = 16) due to occlusive peripheral arterial disease. Between 400 microg and 2000 microg of phVEGF(165) (400 microg, n = 2 800 microg, n = 4
