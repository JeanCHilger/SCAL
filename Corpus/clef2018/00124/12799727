Arterial compromise caused by lower limb osteochondroma. Osteochondromas occasionally cause arterial complications, mainly concerning the distal superficial femoral and popliteal arteries. The authors present 11 patients (12 cases) with arterial disorders caused by exostoses who were hospitalized in their Vascular Clinic. All but 1 had signs or symptoms of peripheral arterial disease such as intermittent claudication or diminished peripheral pulses, and 1 also presented serious neurologic sequelae. All were examined by radiography, ankle-brachial index (ABI), computed tomography scan, color duplex scan, arteriography, and scintigraphy. The popliteal artery was the most commonly affected vessel in 7 cases. In addition to the removal of the offending osteochondroma, 7 patients underwent excision of the diseased arterial segment and replacement by a saphenous vein interposition graft. The remaining 5 cases received a vein graft patch. The authors achieved good results with no serious complications detected in the immediate postoperative period and subsequent follow up. Surgical treatment of the vascular complications caused by exostoses is mandatory. Even in the absence of vascular symptoms, such bony lesions in close proximity to a vessel should be on a close follow-up in order to prevent permanent arterial damage.
