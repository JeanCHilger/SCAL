Color Doppler ultrasound guidance during renal angioplasty and stenting. To investigate whether an imaging technique combining color Doppler ultrasonography and selective renal artery digital subtraction angiography reduces contrast requirements in patients with progressive renal insufficiency undergoing renal artery angioplasty and stenting.Eight patients (5 men mean age 58 years) with renal artery stenosis and renal insufficiency underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting under color Doppler ultrasound guidance.Color Doppler ultrasound imaging yielded the information necessary for verifying catheter position, stent placement and expansion, and hemodynamics after revascularization. The combined imaging technique considerably reduced contrast requirements to only 10 mL in each case. No worsening of renal function was seen in any patient.The combined imaging procedure uses low doses of contrast agent and is especially suited to patients with renal dysfunction undergoing percutaneous renal revascularization.
