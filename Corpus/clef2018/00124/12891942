The spectrum of cystic kidney disease in adulthood: differential diagnosis and complications. Simple renal cysts are the most common renal masses, accounting for roughly 65 to 70% of cases. They most often occur in patients over the age of 50 as determined from post-mortem examination or renal ultrasonography. The major concern with simple renal cysts is differentiating them from more serious disorders, such as polycystic kidney disease and solid masses such as a renal carcinoma or abscess. Renal arteriovenous malformations may present with ultrasound picture mimicking simple parapelvic cyst. Ultrasound, doppler ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are effective in documenting the underlying lesions non-invasively. Arteriography may be useful to characterise vascular lesion. We report here the spectrum of cystic kidney disease in adulthood in a group of patient with different disorders. The differential diagnosis, complications and associated process are discussed.
