Effect of troglitazone on vascular and glucose metabolic actions of insulin in high-sucrose-fed rats. In rats, diets high in simple sugar induce insulin resistance and alter vascular reactivity. The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of 5 weeks treatment with troglitazone on insulin sensitivity, regional hemodynamics, and vascular responses to insulin in chow-fed and high-sucrose-fed rats. Male rats were randomly divided in 4 groups to receive a regular chow diet in the absence (group 1) or presence of troglitazone (0.2% in food group 2), or a sucrose-enriched diet in the absence (group 3) or presence of troglitazone (group 4) for 5 weeks. The rats were instrumented with Doppler flow probes and intravascular catheters to determine blood pressure, heart rate, and regional blood flows. Insulin sensitivity was assessed by the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique. Glucose transport activity was examined in isolated muscles. Sucrose feeding was found to induce insulin resistance and to impair the insulin-mediated skeletal muscle vasodilation. Treatment with troglitazone was found to increase whole-body insulin sensitivity in sucrose- and chow-fed rats, but had no effect on skeletal muscle glucose transport activity measured in isolated muscles from both dietary groups. Changes in regional hemodynamics were observed in both dietary cohorts treated with troglitazone, and the hindquarter vasoconstrictor response to insulin noted in sucrose-fed rats was abolished by the treatment. The vascular effects of troglitazone, and its insulin-related attenuating effects on contractile tone, could have contributed, in part, to improve insulin action on peripheral glucose disposal, presumably by improving blood flow distribution and glucose delivery.
