Preterm birth attenuates association between low birth weight and endothelial dysfunction. Low birth weight predisposes to later coronary disease. To further elucidate the mechanisms behind this association and their timing, vascular endothelial function-a key factor in early pathophysiology of atherosclerosis-was studied in 54 infants born either before the third trimester or at term.All subjects were studied at 3 months of postnatal age. A laser-Doppler technique was used to measure skin perfusion before and after transdermal iontophoresis of acetylcholine (ACh an endothelium-dependent vasodilator). In infants born at term (n=19Impairment in human endothelial function associated with low birth weight occurs or emerges late in pregnancy. Very preterm birth attenuates this association. Different gene-environment interactions in the third trimester may contribute to this finding.
