Cutaneous circulation in Raynaud's phenomenon during emotional stress. A morphological and functional study using capillaroscopy and laser-Doppler. In order to assess the effects of emotional stress on the cutaneous microcirculation in patients suffering from Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) a group of 18 patients with this pathology and 16 healthy control subjects underwent an "arithmetical test". The microcirculatory response was examined using a laser Doppler apparatus. The results obtained showed a constantly reduced flow during mental stress in normal subjects in the RP group it was possible to observe: a first subgroup with a reduced flow similar to that seen in normal subjects, and a second subgroup with a paradoxically increased flow. It is likely that the normal vasoconstrictor response is the expression of the functional impairment of the microcirculation alone (primary RP), whereas vasodilatation in response to mental stress is a sign, of the organic development of the disease right from an early stage.
