Some flow visualization and laser-Doppler-velocity measurements in a true-to-scale elastic model of a human aortic arch--a new model technique. Flow studies were done in an elastic true-to-scale silicone rubber model of an aortic arch to study further hemodynamic influences on atherosclerosis. The model was prepared from a cast of a young woman. A revised model technique was used. The model had a compliance similar to that of the human aortic arch. Velocity measurements were done in the model with a two component laser-Doppler-anemometer in steady and pulsatile flow using a calcium chloride solution with a viscosity of eta = 3.18 mPas and density of rho = 1.28 kg/m3 at 20 degrees C. The time average Reynolds numbers over a whole cycle in the ascending aorta was Re = 1350. The Womersley parameter for pulsatile flow was a = 20. The pulse wave velocity in the ascending aorta was about c = 5.4 m/sec. The secondary flow behavior was discussed for steady and pulsatile flow. Reverse flows were found, especially along the inner radius of the aortic arch in the descending aorta in steady and pulsatile flow and also in small areas of the ascending aorta and at the branches of the aortic arch. The formation of atherosclerotic plaques at preferred local flow regions is discussed.
