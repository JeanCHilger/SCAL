Functional study of peripheral obstructive arteriopathies using an ultrasound flow detector. An ultrasound flow detector was employed to measure pressure values at the ankle at rest and after physical exercise in 91 limbs belonging to 61 patients with various degree of arteriosclerotic occlusion, and in 10 healthy subjects. Basal values and percent falls after effort, and recovery times were compared with the symptomatologies and the different degrees of occlusion. Statistically significant correlations were observed.
