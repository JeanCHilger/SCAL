Vascular endoprosthesis. A new indication in the surgery of the iliac artery. We have used endoprosthesis (Palmaz Schatz) after balloon angioplasty of iliac arterial stenoses or thromboses, in order to increase the immediate patency and to prevent the recurrence of stenosis. Our series gathers 24 patients operated with endovascular procedures over a period of 2 years: 22 men, 2 women--extreme ages 42 to 78 years, average age 63.5 years--Clinical stage: 22 at stage I, 1 at stage III, 1 at stage IV. Arteriographic findings: 8 primary iliac lesions (6 stenoses and 2 thromboses), 11 external iliac lesions (stenoses). All these lesions were atheromatous. One of them had recurred after angioplasty. Usual technique: balloon angioplasty of the stenosis, assessment on a fluoroscopic screen and angioscopy of the result, decision to insert the Palmaz Stent if defects are seen on the image. Repatency of impassable lesions with a YAG laser was carried out in 2 cases. The indication of an endoprosthesis was established on the basis of the radiological image in 17 cases, of the angioscopic image in 4 and systematically in 10 cases of recurrence of stenosis, iliac thrombosis or associated surgery. Associated surgery: 2 femoropopiteal bypass grafts, 3 femorofemoral bypass grafts, 1 deep plasty, 1 superficial femoral recanalization with laser, 1 lymbar sympathectomy. Postoperative results: 1 death due to MI (78-year-old diabetic woman), 1 thrombosis treated with femorofemoral bypass. Middle-term results: after 6 to 24 months, average time lapse 13 months. The comparison of the ankle pressure indices and of the pre- and postoperative sonographic findings shows an indisputable hemodynamic improvement.
