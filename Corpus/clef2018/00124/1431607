Electric stimulation of the spinal cord in arterial diseases of the legs. A multicenter study of 244 patients. From January 1985 through January 1990, 244 patients (168 males, 76 females, mean age: 69 +/- 14 years) received epidural spinal cord stimulation for the treatment of advanced, nonreconstructable, peripheral vascular disease of the lower limbs due to atherosclerosis in 180 patients, atherosclerosis and/or diabetes in 49, and thromboangiitis obliterans in 15 patients: previous surgery included 101 bypass-grafts in 70 patients, 51% of which below the knee, and 117 sympathectomies in 113 patients as the last resource in face of distal peripheral vascular disease of the lower limbs. Mean ankle-to brachial systolic pressure ratio was .31 +/- .34 on symptomatic limbs due to pain and advanced disease, walking capacity was assessed in only 151 patients, either on treadmill in 25, or in a metered corridor in 126
