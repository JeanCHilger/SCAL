Tissue plasminogen activator release in chronic venous hypertension due to heart failure. In order to study the effects of chronic venous hypertension due to heart failure on blood fibrinolytic activity, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) antigen, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) antigen, t-PA activity and PAI activity were measured before and after venous occlusion of the arm for 20 min in 15 patients with right-sided heart failure, 15 patients with left-sided heart failure, and 30 control healthy subjects. Central venous pressure, measured by observing the jugular veins, was above 15 cm of the blood column in all patients with right-sided heart failure, and normal (below 8 cm) in all patients with left-sided heart failure and control subjects. There was no difference in the basal concentrations of t-PA (11.0, 10.2 and 10.8 ng/ml all values medians) and PAI-1 antigens and their activities between right and left-sided heart failure and the control subjects. After the occlusion, t-PA antigen increased significantly less in right-sided heart failure (28.6 ng/ml) than in left-sided heart failure and the control subjects (54.5 and 45.9 ng/ml, respectively). It was concluded that the poor increase in fibrinolytic activity that had already been reported in patients with heart failure, was due to low t-PA release during occlusion and not to a high basal PAI level. It was limited to the patients with right-sided heart failure and was probably the consequence of chronic systemic venous hypertension.
