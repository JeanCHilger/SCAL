Remote iliac artery endarterectomy: seven-year results of a less invasive technique for iliac artery occlusive disease. Remote endarterectomy of external and common iliac artery occlusions through a single, groin incision under fluoroscopic guidance is a relative unknown surgical procedure. This prospective single center cohort study describes this less invasive endovascular technique with the ring strip cutter and its early complications. The results at midterm follow-up are presented.From April 1994 to July 2001, 49 remote-endarterectomies of the external or common iliac artery were performed in a retrograde manner from a single, groin incision in 48 patients (30 men, 31 procedures). The median age was 66 years (39 to 82 years). Indications for operation were as follows: severe claudication in 28 (57%), rest pain in 13 (27%), and gangrene in 8 (16%) procedures. Follow-up included clinical evaluation, ankle-brachial index, and duplex scanning at 6 weeks, 3 months, and yearly thereafter.Intraoperative technical success was achieved in 43 (88%) procedures. A retroperitoneal incision was necessary in three patients for an additional arteriotomy in the iliac artery and in three others for a bypass procedure. The mean follow-up was 20 months (2 to 77 months). Three-year cumulative primary patency rate by means of life table analysis was 60.2% +/- 12.0 (SE). During follow-up, percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty with and without stenting was performed in six and two patients, respectively, resulting in a 3-year primary-assisted patency rate of 85.7% +/- 9.56. Three-year secondary patency was 94.2% +/- 5.50.Remote endarterectomy in external and common iliac arterial occlusive disease is a feasible endovascular procedure with a low complication rate. The midterm primary-assisted patency rate is good.
