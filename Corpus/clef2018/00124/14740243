Persistent angina pectoris in spite of successful myocardial revascularisation. A 73-year-old obese woman underwent coronary artery-bypass operation in 11/1995 because of a coronary two vessel disease. The left coronary artery was bypassed by the left mammarial internal artery. In 2 and 3/2002, balloon-dilatation of stenoses of the right coronary artery and the circumflex was performed. Angina pectoris relapsed and in 9/2002 the patient was admitted to our hospital with tentative diagnosis of restenosis. Physical investigation showed a blood pressure of the right arm of 160/80 and of the left arm of 120/ 80 mmHg. Coronarography showed the three vessel disease known since 2/2002 with a restenosis of the right coronary artery which was immediately treated by balloon-dilatation and stent-implantation. Colour duplex-sonography of the carotid and subclavian arteries revealed extraordinary plaques and a reduced flow of the left vertebral artery. The left subclavian artery could only be seen distal to the discharge of the vertebral artery and showed a poststenotic flow. The patient had angina pectoris when carrying out personal hygiene already 2 days after balloon-dilatation and stent-implantation. ECG showed new aspects. Coronarography showed no relapse of stenosis, but 70% stenosis of the left subclavian artery with a marked coronary-steal-syndrome. In 10/ 2002, the patient underwent balloon-dilatation and stent-implantation of the subclavian stenosis and became free of complaints. Coronary-steal-syndrome can be the reason for persistent angina pectoris in spite of successful coronary artery-bypass operation with a mammarial internal bypass. It is absolutely necessary to take blood pressure from both arms to recognise a possible stenosis of the subclavian artery which can be the key to all.
