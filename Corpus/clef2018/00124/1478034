Risk factors for peripheral vascular disease in hypertensive subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Possible factors predisposing to peripheral vascular disease (PVD) in hypertensive subjects with Type 2 diabetes mellitus were studied. Details of age, sex, duration of diabetes, blood pressure, and smoking habit were recorded in 180 subjects of either White, West Indian Black or Asian ethnic origin. Glycosylated haemoglobin, fasting serum total cholesterol, total high density lipoprotein (HDL), HDL2, low density lipoprotein (LDL-cholesterol), and triglycerides were measured in all subjects. Peripheral vascular disease was defined as an ankle/brachial systolic pressure < 1.0 as measured by the Doppler technique. Multivariate analysis was performed and the following factors were identified as being strongly associated with the presence of PVD with a statistical significance of p < 0.001 LDL-cholesterol, total HDL-cholesterol, age, male sex, diet or oral hypoglycaemic therapy, diastolic blood pressure, and of p < 0.003
