Increased platelet activity in diabetic macroangiopathy. In order to investigate the relationship between the in vivo platelet activity and diabetic macroangiopathy we have measured plasma beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TG) concentrations by means of a very sensitive radioimmunoassay in 55 diabetics, aged 47-80 years, and in 27 non-diabetic healthy controls (group A) of respective age and sex. Among diabetics 17 were free of vascular complications (group B) in terms of diabetic micro- or macroangiopathy, while the remaining 38 (group C) suffered from peripheral occlusive arterial disease (POAD) of the lower limbs. All subjects underwent a thorough clinical and laboratory investigation. The diagnosis of POAD was based upon the findings of Doppler ultrasound examination and was confirmed by selective arteriography. The mean plasma beta-TG concentrations were significantly higher in the two groups of diabetics compared to the non-diabetic controls (p < 0.001), whereas the highest beta-TG levels were found in diabetics with POAD (py 0.001), (beta-TG: mean +/- 1 SD ng/ml group A: 26.50 +/- 13.14
