Impact of a walking program in people with down syndrome. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a pain-free treadmill walking program in intellectually disabled (ID) adults with arterial occlusive disease. Fourteen participants with mild ID participated in the walking program. Six patients showed stable intermittent claudication. A control (nontreadmill, n = 12) group consisted of 4 individuals with intermittent claudication. Noninvasive determinations of lower-limb hemodynamics included photoplethysmography and ankle-brachial pressure. Pain levels were measured according to a pain pathophysiology index. The treadmill program consisted of individually prescribed low-endurance walking at a 0% incline done at a comfortable speed 3 times per week. All participants completed the 15-week walking program and showed significant improvements (p < 0.05) in walking speed, distance, and duration. Pain levels were reduced in individuals suffering from intermittent claudication. Blood hemodynamic parameters also showed significant improvements. In conclusion, low-intensity treadmill walking significantly improved the functional capacities of adult individuals with mild ID with vascular occlusion and reduced pain levels.
