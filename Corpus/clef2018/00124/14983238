Autologous transplantation of peripheral blood stem cells as an effective therapeutic approach for severe arteriosclerosis obliterans of lower extremities. Treatment of severe arteriosclerosis obliterans of lower extremities (ASOLE) remains a clinical challenge. To develop a more effective approach, we evaluated the clinical efficacy of autologous transplantation of mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) in 5 patients with ASOLE. The patients received recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF, 600 micro g/day) for 5 consecutive days. On day 5, PBSCs were collected, sorted from blood circulation of patients, and then intramuscularly injected into their ischemic lower limbs. A significant improvement of clinical manifestations including severe pain, skin temperature and ulcer, was observed, without obvious adverse effect. The patient's limb was successfully saved. Satisfactory remission was obtained 3 months after transplantation as shown by significant improvement in ankle-brachial pressure index (ABI), blood flow in personal vascular laboratory (PVL), laser Doppler blood perfusion, and the angio-graphic scores. Our data suggest for the first time that autologous transplantation of mobilized PBSCs provides a practical, safe, and effective method of treatment for lower limb ischemia.
