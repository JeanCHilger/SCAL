C-reactive protein and risk factors for peripheral vascular disease in subjects with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. To compare the importance of different inflammatory markers and traditional risk factors in predicting peripheral vascular disease (PVD) in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus.A cross-sectional analysis of 30 Type 2 diabetic patients with PVD defined by ankle-brachial index (ABI) < 0.9, and 60 Type 2 diabetic patients without PVD (ABI > 1.0). Overnight blood was drawn and sent for study.Longer diabetic duration (15 +/- 8 vs. 10 +/- 7 years, P = 0.007), higher serum creatinine level (0.11 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.09 +/- 0.03 mmol/l, P = 0.001), higher total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (TC/HDL-C) ratio (5.2 +/- 1.6 vs. 4.3 +/- 1.1, P = 0.004) and increased hypertension status (70% vs. 52%, P = 0.014) and cerebral infarction (CI) history (23% vs. 3%, P = 0.009) were noted in Type 2 diabetes with PVD. Those with PVD also showed significantly higher serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) (median 0.282 vs. 0.102 mg/dl, P < 0.001) and interleukin (IL)-6 (10.6 +/- 1.81 vs 1.6 +/- 4.6 pg/ml, P = 0.001). Multivariate regression analysis showed that higher serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), longer diabetic duration, and use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) were independently associated with PVD in Type 2 diabetes mellitus.Type 2 diabetic patients with PVD had longer diabetic duration, higher serum creatinine levels, higher TC/HDL-C ratio, higher hypertension and CI history and higher CRP and IL-6 levels. Only serum CRP level, diabetic duration, and use of ACEI were independently associated with PVD in Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
