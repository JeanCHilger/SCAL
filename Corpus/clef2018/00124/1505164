Redistribution of skin blood flow during leg dependency in peripheral arterial occlusive disease. A disturbed autoregulation of cutaneous blood flow in legs with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) has previously been demonstrated for circumscribed skin areas. In the present study, posturally-induced changes of skin perfusion distribution along ischaemic limbs were investigated topographically in 35 PAOD patients by means of fluorescein perfusography. Among the 68 legs studied, 7 had patent arteries and 61 could be assigned to FONTAINE stages I to IV. Limbs with peripheral skin lesions (stage IV) were further differentiated according to either healing (stage IV+) or non-healing (stage IV-) on conservative treatment. Sitting-up always led to prolonged calf as well as foot fluorescein appearance times (AT) except for legs in stage III or IV- disease. In the latter two groups, decreased sitting as compared to supine AT foot-to-calf ratios indicated a relative shift of dye delivery from proximal towards distal skin regions during posture. In contrast, this measure of blood flow redistribution did not change in the other groups. The redirection of fluorescein influx was significantly correlated with the systolic arterial pressure ankle-to-arm ratios. In conclusion, besides small perfusion pressure increases or passive microvessel distension, a shift of the peripheral resistance ratios may contribute to the improved blood supply of ischaemic skin regions during leg dependency. An arteriolar vasoparalysis does not regularly exist in limbs with skin lesions not primarily originating from ischaemia (stage IV+).
