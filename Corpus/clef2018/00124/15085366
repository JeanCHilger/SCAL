Influence of impaired fasting glucose on the incidence and prognosis of atherosclerosis in various vascular regions. Patients with cardiovascular disease have a poorer diagnosis if they are diabetic. The risk for cardiovascular events is already increased in individuals with impaired fasting glucose (IFG). The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of diabetes mellitus (DM) and IFG on the incidence of atherosclerotic manifestations and on the long-term prognosis of patients with atherosclerosis in various vascular regions.In a prospective study we included 906 patients (72.5% men, mean age 62 +/- 9 years) preceding heart catheterization. All patients were evaluated for the presence of peripheral stenosis by carotid duplex sonography (pathologic: stenosis >50%) and evaluation of the ankle-brachial index (pathologic <0.9). Blood samples were drawn from each subject after an overnight fasting period and serum glucose was evaluated.Patients were compared with regard to the presence of DM (known DMor fasting glucose > or =126 mg/dL, N = 283, 31.2%) or IFG (fasting glucose >110 and <126 mg/dL, N = 89, 9.8%). Patients with IFG and DM had a higher prevalence of atherosclerotic manifestations in the coronary, carotid and peripheral vessels. Diabetics had the highest prevalence of atherosclerotic manifestations in multiple vascular regions (=advanced atherosclerosis). Cardiovascular events (death, myocardial infarction and stroke) after a median follow-up of 4.1 years were evaluated in 901 patients (99.4%). Presence of IFG and DM significantly increased the incidence of cardiovascular events (event rate: no DM 10.9%, IFG 13.6%, DM 23.4%, P < 0.0001). Moreover, patients with advanced atherosclerosis suffered significantly more often from cardiovascular events (event rate: no stenosis 4.1%, coronary artery disease without peripheral stenosis 9.7%, advanced atherosclerosis 23.9%). Prognosis was worst in patients with DM and advanced atherosclerosis with an event rate of 35%.Patients with cardiovascular disease have a poorer prognosis if they are diabetic. The risk for cardiovascular events is already increased in individuals with impaired fasting glucose (IFG). The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of diabetes mellitus (DM) and IFG on the incidence of atherosclerotic manifestations and on the long-term prognosis of patients with atherosclerosis in various vascular regions.
