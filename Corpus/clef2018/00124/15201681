Surgical repair for late-onset hepatic venous outflow block after living-donor liver transplantation. The incidence of hepatic venous complications in partial liver transplantation is more frequent than that in whole liver transplantation. There are no reports of a surgical strategy for hepatic venous outflow block (HVOB) after living-donor liver transplantation. HVOB was diagnosed when the pull-through pressure gradient across the anastomotic site was over 5 mm Hg. Reoperation for venous anastomosis was performed if the angioplasty was unsuccessful. After dissection around the hepatic venous anastomotic site, a patch venoplasty of the anastomosis was performed. When the inferior vena cava was constricted, venoatrial anastomosis was performed. In 6 years, 5 of 223 patients experienced HVOB. Balloon angioplasty was successfully performed in two patients, a patch venoplasty of the anastomosis in two, and venoatrial anastomosis in one. In all patients, the ascites stopped. HVOB must be diagnosed as soon as possible with Doppler ultrasound and venography. Prompt surgical revision can salvage the grafts.
