Age and regional specificity of peak limb vascular conductance in men. Because of methodological variation in previous studies, age-associated changes in peak limb vascular conductance (VC(peak) a functional index of arterial structure) and its determinants remain poorly defined. The objectives of this study were to describe and compare age-associated changes in peak forearm and calf conductance across a broad age range and to identify physiological characteristics that are predictive of variation in limb-specific VC(peak). Peak conductance (plethysmographic flow/brachial mean arterial pressure) of the forearm (forearm VC(peak)) and calf (calf VC(peak)) after 10 min of arterial occlusion was measured twice in 68 healthy, normally active men aged 20-79 yr. Aerobic capacity (cycle peak oxygen consumption), arterial health (ankle-brachial index, pulse wave velocity), and limb-specific measures of muscle mass (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) and isometric strength (grip, plantar flexion) were also assessed. The relative decline in forearm VC(peak) with age (-6.6% per decade
