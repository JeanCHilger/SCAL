Low-contrast medium doses for ultrasound imaging during renal revascularization by PTA-stenting. To evaluate the incidence of progressive renal damage in patients with chronic renal insufficiency and renal-artery stenosis undergoing percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting (PTA-stenting), color Doppler ultrasound (CDU)-guided, a procedure requiring low-contrast medium doses, or digital subtraction angiography were compared.Thirty patients with renal artery stenosis and severe renal insufficiency underwent PTA-stenting for revascularization, 15 patients with CDU guidance and 15 patients with standard selective digital subtraction angiography (SDSA). Serum creatinine (Cr) concentrations were compared in the two groups at 6 days and 12 months after revascularization.The stents were properly positioned and resolved the renal artery stenosis. None of the patients who underwent ultrasound-guided PTA-stenting had significantly increased Cr values (>50% or >1 mg/dL) at 6 days after surgery (95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0-21.8) and none had progressive chronic renal insufficiency at 12 months. Conversely, six of the 15 patients in the group who underwent PTA-stenting with standard SDSA had significantly increased Cr values at 6 days (95% CI, 16.3-67.7) and two patients had progressive chronic renal insufficiency at 12 months.Our results suggest that PTA-stenting under CDU guidance, a procedure requiring low-contrast medium doses, is suitable for patients with severe renal dysfunction and especially for those with diabetes mellitus undergoing percutaneous renal revascularization.
