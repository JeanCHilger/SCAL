Summary of the practice guideline 'Peripheral vascular disease' (first revision) from the Dutch College of General Practitioners. Peripheral vascular disease is a manifestation of atherosclerosis and may occur with or without signs or symptoms. The local prognosis is worse with signs or symptoms. The concomitant atherosclerosis in heart and brain is responsible for long-term morbidity and mortality. Absence of signs and symptoms almost excludes peripheral vascular disease, but for the diagnosis an ankle-brachial index is mandatory. This implies a protocol in general practice. Treatment of peripheral vascular disease consists of advice on cardiovascular risk factors, stopping smoking, walking exercises, and foot care. For peripheral vascular disease, anti-thrombotic medication is advised.
