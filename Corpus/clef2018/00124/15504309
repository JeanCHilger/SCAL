Left ventricular mass and function in growth hormone deficient children and adolescents before and after one year of recombinant human growth hormone (GH) replacement therapy. A total of 25 patients (10 girls and 15 boys) aged 8.1-16.9 years (mean 13.3+/-1.8 years), height 1.15-1.61 m (mean 1.4+/-0.1 m), body area 0.84-1.47 m2 (mean 1.14+/-0.18 m2) were examined in our study. After 12-month--rhGH therapy, 23 children (9 girls and 14 boys) were re-evaluated. Twenty two healthy and slim children (11 girls and 11 boys) aged 6.6-16 years (mean 12,6+/-2.7 years), height 1.33-1.8 m (mean 1.58+/-0.16), body area 0.93-1.8 m2 (mean 1.38+/-0.3 m2) with a family history without atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases constituted controls. Mass and function of LV were evaluated by means of M-mode and 2D echocardiography and the Doppler method with simultaneous 2D picture recording. Systolic function parameters (SF and EF) were normal in each patient before therapy. LV systolic fraction (SF) equaled on average 35.4+/-4.5 % in the examined group and 36.7+/-3.9 % in controls. LV ejection fraction (EF) was on average 65.1+/-5.9 % in the examined group and 67.9+/-6.4 % in controls. The differences noted were not statistically significant. After a year-rhGH therapy, SF and EF were within a normal range in each patient. SF was on average 35.9+/-3.6% in the examined group and 36.7+/-3.9% in controls. EF was on average 65.7+/-4.6% in the examined group and 67.9+/-6.4% in controls. The differences were not statistically significant. SF and EF did not differ before and after rhGH therapy. LV mass indexed by body superficial area (LVA/BSA) equaled 68.3+/-18.6 g/m2 before therapy and did not differ significantly in comparison with controls (68.2+/-15.5 g/m2). After a year-GH therapy, LV/BSA was significantly higher when compared to LV/BSA mass before therapy (78.2+/-14.9 g/m2 vs 68.3+/-18 6 g/m2, p<0.05). After a year-GH therapy LV/BSA mass was significantly higher in comparison with LV/BSA mass before therapy (78.2+/-14.9 g/m2 vs 68.3+/-18.6 g/m2, p< 0.05). Before therapy, IVRT parameter was found significantly extended in comparison with controls (70.8+/-14.2 vs 64.1+/-8.5 ms, p<0.05). Other parameters characterising LV diastolic function were not significantly different between the groups. After a year-GH therapy, IVRT parameter was still extended in comparison with controls (72.3+/-9.2 vs 64.1+/-8.5 ms, p<0.05). No significant differences were observed with regard to IVRT before and after therapy.1. A significant extension of isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT) was proved in children with GH deficiency, which may suggest an impaired diastolic function of the heart left ventricle. 2. 12-month-rhGH replacement therapy causes an increase in the left ventricle mass when compared to the values before therapy, whereas isovolumetric relaxation time remains still longer. 3. Children with GH deficiency should have their circulatory system monitored to observe the dynamics of the left ventricle functional disorders.
