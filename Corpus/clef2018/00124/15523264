Systolic pressure, a powerful marker of the risk of obliterating artery disease of the lower limbs. A MARKER OF PERIPHERAL ARTERIAL DISEASE: The measurement of the ankle/arm index (AAI) is a simple, rapid and inexpensive means for the assessment of distal lower limb perfusion. Its decrease reveals an alteration in the patient's arterial status. Consecutively, AAI is an excellent marker of peripheral arterial disease, well before the onset of functional consequences. A TRIPLE MARKER: Beyond the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease, AAI provides other interests: it is not only a tool for the functional assessment of lower limb perfusion, but also a marker of local and general atherosclerosis, as well as cardiovascular events.
