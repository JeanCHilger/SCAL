Reproducibility of the cold-induced vasodilation response in the human finger. Cold-induced vasodilation (CIVD) is a cyclic oscillation in blood flow that occurs in the extremities on cold exposure and that is likely associated with reduced risk of cold injury (e.g., frostbite) as well as improved manual dexterity and less pain while working in the cold. The CIVD response varies between individuals, but the within-subject reproducibility has not been adequately described. The purpose of this study was to quantify the within-subject variability in the CIVD response under standardized conditions. Twenty-one volunteers resting in a controlled environment (27 degrees C) immersed the middle finger in warm water (42 degrees C) for 15 min to standardize initial finger temperature and then in cold water (4 degrees C CWI) for 30 min, on five separate occasions.
