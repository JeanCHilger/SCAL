Initial clinical experience with a new pulsed dye laser device in angioplasty of limb ischemia and shunt fistula obstructions. Selective plaque ablation with laser radiation at 405-530 nm in vitro has been reported. We investigated the possibilities of a new pulsed dye laser device for in vivo recanalization of arteries in ischemic lower limbs and stenoses/occlusions of arterio-venous hemodialysis shunt fistulae. A specially designed 9F or 7F multifiber catheter was used for treatment of 10 patients with lower limb artery obliterations and 11 patients with malfunctioning hemodialysis access fistulae (HAF). The recanalization technical success was 5/5 in the iliac arteries (IA), 4/5 in the superficial femoral arteries (SFA), and 11/11 in the HAF. Early re-occlusions occurred in one SFA and one IA, respectively, caused by very bad run-off. There was one clinically insignificant SFA perforation. Additional balloon angioplasty was considered necessary in 10/16 lesions. Mean ankle-arm index increased from 0.68 to 0.97. With two exceptions all HAF patients were re-integrated in the dialysis program. Pulsed dye laser angioplasty promises to be an effective and fast method for plaque ablation/debulking. The first clinical experience confirms previous in vitro results. In particular laser recanalization may become the method of choice for treatment of rigid HAF obstructions and it seems to be superior to vascular surgery or balloon angioplasty alone.
