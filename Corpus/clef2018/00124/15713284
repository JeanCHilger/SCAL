Wave intensity in the ascending aorta: effects of arterial occlusion. We examine the effects of arterial occlusion on the pressure, velocity and the reflected waves in the ascending aorta using wave intensity analysis. In 11 anaesthetised, open-chested dogs, snares were used to produce total arterial occlusion at 4 sites: the upper descending aorta at the level of the aortic valve (thoracic) the lower thoracic aorta at the level of the diaphragm (diaphragm)
