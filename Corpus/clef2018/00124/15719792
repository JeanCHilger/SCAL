Heel pressure ulcers and ankle brachial pressure index. There is a substantial body of literature that emphasises the importance of measuring ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) as part of an holistic assessment for leg ulcers (Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network, 1998). However, there is a paucity of research-based evidence to indicate the importance of measuring ABPI as part of an holistic assessment for patients who develop pressure ulcers on their heels. (ABPI is a simple, non-invasive method of identifying arterial insufficiency within a limb.) The importance of identifying the presence of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) in patients who develop pressure ulcers on their heels is discussed, as is the argument for measuring ABPI as part of an holistic assessment for heel ulceration before planning the wound management.
