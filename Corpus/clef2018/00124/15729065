Effect of intermittent pneumatic compression of foot and calf on walking distance, hemodynamics, and quality of life in patients with arterial claudication: a prospective randomized controlled study with 1-year follow-up. Perioperative mortality, graft failure, and angioplasty limitations militate against active intervention for claudication. With the exception of exercise programs, conservative treatments yield modest results. Intermittent pneumatic compression [IPC] of the foot used daily for 3 months enhances the walking ability and pressure indices of claudicants. Although IPC applied to the foot and calf together [IPCfoot+calf] is hemodynamically superior to IPC of the foot, its clinical effects in claudicants remain undetermined.This prospective randomized controlled study evaluates the effects of IPCfoot+calf on the walking ability, peripheral hemodynamics, and quality of life [QOL] in patients with arterial claudication.Forty-one stable claudicants, meeting stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria, were randomized to receive either IPCfoot+calf and aspirin[75 mg] (Group 1 n = 20), or aspirin[75 mg] alone (Group 2At 5/12 median ICD, ACD, resting and postexercise ABI had increased by 197%, 212%, 17%, and 64%, respectively, in Group 1 (P < 0.001), but had changed little (P > 0.1) in Group 2 Group 1 had better ICD, ACD, and resting and postexercise ABI (P < 0.01) than Group 2. Inter- and intragroup popliteal flow differences at 5/12 were small (P > 0.1). QOL had improved significantly in Group 1 but not in Group 2IPCfoot+calf emerged as an effective, high-compliance, complication-free method for improving the walking ability and pressure indices in stable claudication, with a durable outcome. These changes were associated with a significant improvement in all aspects of QOL evaluated with the SF-36. Despite some limited benefit noted in some individuals, unsupervised exercise had a nonsignificant impact overall.
