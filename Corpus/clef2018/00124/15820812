Genital duplex Doppler ultrasonography before and after sexual stimulation in women with sexual dysfunction: gray scale, volumetric, and hemodynamic findings. To report gray scale, volumetric, and duplex ultrasound data before and after sexual stimulation in a large population of women with sexual dysfunction.Retrospective review of women with sexual dysfunction.An academic center.Pre- and postmenopausal women with sexual dysfunction.None.This is an Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective study of 142 women who underwent duplex Doppler ultrasound (DDU) arousal testing for sexual dysfunction.This study revealed that DDU was able to record morphologic, volumetric (clitoral and corpora spongiosa diameters), and hemodynamic (peak systolic and end-diastolic) changes in women with sexual dysfunction before and after sexual stimulation. Resistive index measurements, which are indicative of veno-occlusive function, did not significantly change before and after arousal in both the clitoris and corpora spongiosa. We also found a correlation between genital diameter and genital end-diastolic velocity value. Gray scale scanning revealed tunical thickening or plaque in several patients who sustained blunt perineal trauma.The role of DDU in the management of women with sexual dysfunction remains to be determined however, end-diastolic velocity values suggest that this parameter has an important physiologic implication as a direct determinant of genital engorgement.
