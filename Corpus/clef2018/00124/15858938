Intraortic pulse pressure is correlated with coronary artery stenosis. There is increasing evidence that peripheral pulse pressure measured at the brachial artery is a good predictor of coronary heart disease. However, the relation between pulse pressure and angiographically demonstrated coronary artery stenosis has not been fully elucidated. We designed the present study to investigate the association of the various components of blood pressure, such as systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, and pulse pressure of both peripheral and central arteries with angiographically determined coronary artery stenosis. Levels of aortic systolic pressure, aortic diastolic pressure, aortic pulse pressure, peripheral systolic pressure, peripheral diastolic pressure, and peripheral pulse pressure were determined in 323 patients who underwent diagnostic coronary angiography. Of these 323 patients, 215 patients had significant organic coronary artery stenosis. Aortic pulse pressure was significantly higher in patients with coronary artery stenosis (P = 0.0050). Aortic diastolic pressure was lower in patients with coronary artery stenosis (marginally significant, P = 0.0462). However, no statistically significant difference was observed between other blood pressure components and coronary artery stenosis. Multivariate analyses showed that aortic pulse pressure was associated with coronary artery stenosis independently of aortic diastolic pressure. Moreover, aortic pulse pressure was positively correlated with the number of vessels involved (P = 0.0024). The results of the present study indicate that aortic pulse pressure is significantly and independently correlated with angiographically determined coronary artery stenosis.
