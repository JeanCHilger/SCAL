Rare cause of pectangina after coronary artery surgery. The coronary subclavian-steal-syndrome is a rare cause for angina pectoris following A. mammaria interna bypass operation. A 72-year-old male patient presented with vertigo and angina pectoris. A three vessel coronary artery disease was known and coronary artery surgery with three aortocoronary bypasses had been performed a year prior to presentation. A difference in peripheral arterial pressure between the right (150/80 mmHg) and the left (125/75 mmHg) arm was noted at physical examination. Color Doppler sonography of the left vertebral arteria exhibited a retrograde flow suggesting a coronary subclavian-steal-syndrome. Angiography revealed a significant stenosis of the left arteria subclavia. The stenosis was successfully treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stent implantation.
