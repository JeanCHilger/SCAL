How to recognize POAD? The diagnosis of peripheral occlusive arterial disease in the physician's office. Peripheral occlusive arterial disease (POAD) encompasses all stenotic and occlusive changes affecting the aorta and arteries supplying the extremities, and in 90% of the cases is due to atherosclerosis. In the majority of patients the lower extremities are involved, andonly every third patient has symptoms. Apart from its significance as an independent disease entity, POAD is also an important coincidence marker, in particular for coronary heart disease. For the diagnostic clarification of POAD, a stepped strategy is recommended, including clinical function testing, such as an exercise treadmill test. Doppler sonography and determination of the Doppler pressure index (ankle-brachial index) make possible a noninvasive accurate staging. Color-coded duplex sonography and imaging procedures provide further information, and are indispensable for establishing the indication for interventional measures.
