Relative tolerance to upper- and lower-limb aerobic exercise in patients with peripheral arterial disease. To investigate the effects of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) on relative tolerance to upper- and lower-limb aerobic exercise.Peak cardiorespiratory responses evoked by an incremental arm-cranking test (ACT) and an incremental leg-cranking test (LCT) were compared in patients with PAD (N=101 median age 69 year, range 50-85 years). Claudication distance (CD) and total distance before intolerable claudication pain (maximum walking distance: MWD) were also assessed during walking.Peak oxygen consumption (V O(2)) for the ACT was 94% of that measured for the LCT (1.01+/-0.03 versus 1.10+/-0.03lmin(-1), respectively P<0.001), but in a significant proportion of patients (35%Upper-limb aerobic conditioning could be a useful exercise stimulus for maintaining or improving cardiorespiratory function in patients with severe PAD as they have a greater relative upper-limb aerobic power.
