Vascular dysfunction and ischemic destruction of tissue in Streptococcus pyogenes infection: the role of streptolysin O-induced platelet/neutrophil complexes. Rapid tissue destruction in group A streptococcal (GAS) necrotizing fasciitis/myonecrosis often necessitates extensive debridement to ensure survival. The mechanisms responsible for this fulminant process remain unknown we hypothesized that toxin-induced ischemia contributes to necrosis. In a rat model, Doppler flowmetry was used to measure local blood flow at the site of the intramuscular injection of exotoxins from an invasive M-type 1 GAS, which caused a rapid, dose-dependent decrease in perfusion that was irreversible at the highest toxin concentration tested. Videomicroscopic results revealed that blood flow was impeded by occlusive intravascular cellular aggregates. Flow-cytometric results confirmed that GAS toxins induced the coaggregation of platelets and neutrophils, that this activity was attributable to streptolysin O, and that platelet/neutrophil complex formation was largely mediated by platelet P-selectin (CD62P). Strategies that target platelet adherence molecules may prevent vascular occlusion, maintain tissue viability, and reduce the need for amputation in necrotizing GAS infections.
