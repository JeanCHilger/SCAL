Age and regional specificity of peak limb vascular conductance in women. The influence of age on limb vasodilator capacity in women is unclear. The objectives of this study were to characterize and compare age-associated changes in forearm and calf peak vascular conductance (VC(peak) a functional index of arterial structure) in women and to identify physiological characteristics predictive of variation in limb-specific VC(peak). Peak conductance (plethysmographic flow/mean arterial pressure), VC(peak) of the forearm (forearm VC(peak)), and calf (calf VC(peak)) after 10 min of arterial occlusion were measured in 58 healthy, normally active women aged 21-79 yr. Aerobic capacity (cycle peak oxygen uptake), arterial health (pulse-wave velocity, ankle-brachial index), total cholesterol, limb-specific tissue composition (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), and isometric strength (handgrip, plantar flexion) were also assessed. The relative decline in calf VC(peak) with age (-6.8% per decade, P < 0.001) was greater than the forearm (-4.4% per decade, P = 0.004), in contrast to results previously reported for men (forearm decline > calf decline). Limb VC(peak) per kilogram muscle declined with age in the calf (-6.0% per decade
