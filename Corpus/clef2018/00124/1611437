Mechanism of action of external compression on venous function. Compression stockings and bandages have been shown to improve venous haemodynamics and may act by reducing venous reflux. The aim of this study was to assess the mechanism of action of compression therapy on venous function and to determine whether such treatment may correct valvular incompetence. Both lower limbs of 36 patients (median age 59 (interquartile range 45-65) years) were assessed by duplex ultrasonographic scanning. There were 17 limbs with popliteal vein reflux, 19 with long saphenous vein (LSV) reflux and 21 with short saphenous vein (SSV) reflux. A water-filled adjustable pressure cuff was applied around the knee and inflated gradually, while continuously assessing the veins for reflux using ultrasonographic imaging. The external pressure applied by the cuff was noted when reflux was abolished or when the vein was completely occluded. In four (24 per cent) of 17 popliteal veins, eight (42 per cent) of 19 LSVs and three (14 per cent) of 21 SSVs reflux was abolished before occlusion of the vein. The cuff pressures required to achieve restoration of valvular function were significantly lower than those required to occlude the veins. It is possible, in some refluxing veins, to correct valvular dysfunction by external compression therapy. Coaptation of valvular cuffs to restore valvular competence may be the mechanism of action of compression therapy in venous disease.
