Infected femoral pseudoaneurysm in intravenous drug abusers. The result of surgical treatment of 21 infected femoral pseudoaneurysms in 19 intravenous drug addicts was evaluated. Eight pseudoaneurysms involved only the common or superficial femoral artery and 13 involved the femoral bifurcation. Excision and ligation was performed as the sole procedure in 19 instances, and revascularization by bypass through the obturator route was carried out in two. The mean follow-up was 12.3 months. One patient required an above-knee amputation. The resultant ischaemia was greater after triple vessel ligation (mean ankle:brachial pressure index (ABPI) 0.41) than single vessel ligation (mean ABPI 0.58). Postoperative bleeding occurred in one patient. Intermittent claudication was present in 14 patients after excision and ligation. Claudication was universal and more severe after triple than after single vessel ligation. There was no subsequent limb loss. Excision and ligation is safe and is the treatment of choice for infected femoral pseudoaneurysm in drug addicts.
