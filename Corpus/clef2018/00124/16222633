The ankle-brachial blood pressure index as a risk indicator of generalized atherosclerosis. Contemporary methods of assessment of possible cardiovascular disease based on traditional risk factors are not perfect. Therefore new ways are sought. Simple and inexpensive methods include assessment of the blood pressure on the lower extremities above the ankles. The finding of a reduced ratio of the ankle-brachial blood pressure index (ABI) indicates atherosclerosis of the lower extremity arteries. ABI values of 0.9 or less are associated with a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (in particular myocardial infarction and stroke) that is independent of other risk factors. ABI assessment is a simple clinical examination and should be performed in middle-aged and elderly subjects with a medium and high cardiovascular risk in order to define more accurately their health status. Patients with reduced ABI of 0.9 or less are candidates for secondary preventive treatment for cardiovascular disease.
