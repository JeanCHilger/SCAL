A study of arteriosclerosis in healthy subjects with HBV and HCV infection. It is unclear whether infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects arteriosclerosis. We performed a cross-sectional study to clarify the effect of HBV and HCV infection on arteriosclerosis.The study subjects were 1806 healthy individuals who visited Shimane Environment and Health Public Corporation for routine medical check-ups. Serum levels of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood glucose were investigated in all subjects. The degree of arteriosclerosis was assessed using systolic blood pressure, the bilateral ankle brachial index (ABI), the heart-carotid pulse wave velocity (HCPWV), and the heart-ankle PWV (HAPWV). These cardiovascular parameters were compared between control subjects and subjects with HBV and HCV infection, using analysis of covariance to adjust for confounding factors (sex, age, body mass index, and smoking and drinking).Of the 1806 subjects, 39 and 31 were diagnosed as positive for HBV and HCV infection, respectively. The remaining 1736 were considered to be the controls. Adjusted serum lipid levels in the subjects with HBV and those with HCV infection tended to be lower than those in the control subjects. Adjusted arteriosclerotic parameters in the subjects with HBV and HCV infection were similar to those in the control subjects, even after adjusting for serum lipid levels.Infection with HBV or HCV does not influence the severity of arteriosclerosis in healthy subjects.
