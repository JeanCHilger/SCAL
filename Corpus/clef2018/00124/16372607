The results of superficial femoral, popliteal, and tibial artery stenting for peripheral vascular occlusive disease. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the patentcy rates and physiological effectiveness of angioplasty and stenting as a primary therapy for superficial femoral (SFA), popliteal (POP), and tibial (TIB) arterial occlusive disease. Seventy-eight patients had stents placed in the infra-inguinal vessels between January 1, 2001, and July 31, 2004. We collected data on patient demographics, symptoms, as well as pre- and postprocedure ankle-brachial index (ABI) and angiographic findings. Patency rates at 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months were analyzed by life table methods. Thirty-one men and 47 women had a mean age of 68 years (range 36-94 years). Risk factors included diabetes in 50 per cent, hypertension in 79 per cent, smoking in 41 per cent, and end-stage renal disease in 10 per cent. The indications for intervention were claudication in 52 per cent and limb salvage in 48 per cent of patients. Stents were placed in the SFA in 54 patients (69%), in the POP in 15 patients (18%), and in the TIB artery in 6 patients (8%). Average follow-up was 11.2 months. The mean postprocedural increase in ABI was 0.29. The 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year primary patency rates were 83 per cent, 58 per cent, and 47 per cent, respectively. Limb salvage was achieved in 66 per cent of patients treated for limb-threatening ischemia. There was one major and three minor complications. Stenting of the infra-inguinal vessels has a low morbidity, high success rate, and acceptable patency and limb-salvage rates.
