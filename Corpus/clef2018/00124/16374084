Stent placement for chronic iliac arterial occlusive disease: the results of 10 years experience in a single institution. We wanted to retrospectively evaluate the long-term therapeutic results of iliac arterial stent placement that was done in a single institution for 10 years.From May 1994 to April 2004, 206 patients who underwent iliac arterial stent placement (mean age 64+/-8.8) were followed up for evaluating the long term stent patency. Combined or subsequent bypass surgery was performed in 72 patients. The follow up period ranged from one month to 120 months (meanTwo hundred and eighty-four stents were placed in 249 limbs of 203 patients. The technical success rate was 98% (203/206). The primary patency rates of the stents at 3, 5, 7 and 10 year were 87%, 83%, 61% and 49%, respectively. One hundred seventy-seven patients maintained the primary stent patency until the final follow up and 26 patients showed stenosis or obstruction during the follow up. Secondary intervention was performed in thirteen patients. Lesions in the external iliac artery (EIA) or lesions in both the common iliac artery (CIA) and EIA were a poor prognostic factor for stent patency. The run off score and stent diameter also showed statistically significant influence on stent patency. The overall complication rate was 6%.Iliac arterial stent placement is a safe treatment with favorable long term patency. Lesions in the EIA or lesions in both the EIA and CIA, poor run off vessels and a stent having the same or a larger diameter than 10 mm were the poor prognostic factors for long term stent patency.
