Effect of the oral hypoglycaemic sulphonylurea glibenclamide, a blocker of ATP-sensitive potassium channels, on walking distance in patients with intermittent claudication. The oral hypoglycaemic sulphonylurea glibenclamide stimulates endogenous insulin secretion through blockade of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels on pancreatic beta cells, but also blocks cardiovascular KATP channels, leading to increased peripheral vascular resistance and reduced peripheral blood flow in non-diabetic subjects. Therefore, this study examined whether a single oral dose of glibenclamide adversely affected the pain-free or maximal walking distance in patients with intermittent claudication.In a double-blind, randomized crossover study, 12 non-diabetic patients with intermittent claudication were given a single oral dose of glibenclamide (5.25 mg) or placebo separated by a washout period of 1 week. A treadmill test was carried out 180 min after glibenclamide/placebo intake for determination of pain-free and maximal walking distance. Plasma glucose concentrations were kept constant by an euglycemic clamp. Changes in ankle/brachial blood pressure index (ABI), serum insulin, and serum glibenclamide were also assessed.The pain-free walking distance was 62.8 +/- 9.8 metres (mean +/- sem) after glibenclamide and 52.6 +/- 5.9 metres after placebo (P = 0.52). The maximal walking distance was 142.7 +/- 18.7 metres after glibenclamide and 132.6 +/- 16.6 metres after placebo (P = 0.23). The ABI was not significantly changed by glibenclamide compared with placebo. Serum glibenclamide was 0.51 +/- 0.08 microm 180 min after administration of the drug. Glibenclamide produced an 8-fold increase in circulating insulin compared with placebo (P < 0.001).Glibenclamide given as a single oral dose commonly used in glucose-lowering drug therapy does not reduce pain-free or maximal walking distance in non-diabetic patients with intermittent claudication.
