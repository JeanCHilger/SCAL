The association between positional vertebral and basilar artery flow lesion and prevalence of vertigo in patients with cervical spondylosis. The aim of our investigations was to characterize the relationship between basilar artery (BA) flow velocity in patients with cervical spondylosis and age, grade of radiological changes, prevalence of vertigo, and decreased blood flow velocity through vertebral arteries (VA) after head rotation.A prospective, controlled study in academic neurotology was conducted. We examined 80 patients with radiological evidence of cervical spondylosis. Forty patients complained of positional vertigo lasting more than 6 months. Patients were examined by transcranial Doppler ultrasound with head rotations.We showed significant association between velocity flow in basilar artery after neck rotation and age, prevalence of vertigo, grade of radiological changes, and positional vertebral artery flow lesion.Spondylotic-induced VA compression may be the reason for decreased blood flow velocity in the basilar artery during head rotation, which may be of particular importance for older patients, especially complaining of vertigo.Every patient with high-grade cervical spondylosis, especially complaining of vertigo, should be examined by using TCD (transcranial Doppler) with head rotations. In case of positional blood flow reduction during head rotation, further angiographic examination should be undertaken so as to plan suitable treatment.C-4.
