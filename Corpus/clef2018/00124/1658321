Evaluation of vulvar irritancy potential of a menstrual pad containing sodium bicarbonate in short-term application. The effect on the skin of menstrual pads containing sodium bicarbonate as a fragrance substitute and of sodium bicarbonate alone was studied in 50 healthy women. Skin changes were monitored by transepidermal water loss, capacitance, laser Doppler flowmetry, skin surface pH and visual scoring. No clinical signs developed after the volunteers had been patched with the menstrual pads for 24 hours. No subclinical vulvar skin irritant reactions were observed with bioengineering methods. The menstrual pads containing sodium bicarbonate as a deodorant did not significantly affect the vulva in short-term use.
