Study on the independent association of uric acid levels with peripheral arterial disease in Chinese patients with coronary heart disease. To evaluate the relationship between uric acid (UA) and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in Chinese patients with coronary heart disease (CHD).UA levels and PAD were evaluated in 3251 Chinese hospitalized patients with CHD (age > or = 50 years). PAD was diagnosed when the ankle-brachial index was < 0.9 but patients with an ankle-brachial index of > 1.4 were excluded because of false negative rate. Potential confounding variables with P < 0.10 were adjusted for multivariate analysis.In univariate analysis, UA levels were higher in patients with PAD than in those without PAD (349.80 micromol/L +/- 128.45 micromol/L vs. 323.00 micromol/L +/- 110.72 micromol/L, P < 0.001). Rate of hyperuricemia in patients with PAD and without PAD were 31.62% and 22.48% (P < 0.001) respectively. Prevalence rates of PAD for quintiles of UA level were 23.2%, 27.4%, 36.1%, 43.2% and 72.7%, respectively (P-trend < 0.05). With UA level as a continuous variable, the multivariate-adjusted odds ratio for PAD was 1.002 (95% confidence interval: 1.001 - 1.002) (P < 0.001). The optimal cut-off point for UA as determined by the receiver operating characteristic curve, was 227.2 micromol/L. The sensitivity and specificity at this cut-off point were 84.6% and 20.3%, respectively. The area under curve was 0.521 (95% confidence interval: 0.504 - 0.547) and the multivariate-adjusted odds ratio for PAD for UA above this level was 1.292 (95% confidence interval: 1.047 - 1.596) (P < 0.01). The results, however, after exclusion those cases who used diuretics, were similar.Elevated uric acid level seemed a significant and independent risk factor for PAD in Chinese hospitalized patients with CHD (age > or = 50 years).
