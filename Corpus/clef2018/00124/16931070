Cryoplasty for arterial restenosis. A prospective follow-up study of patients with arterial restenosis undergoing cryoplasty.Between May 2004 and June 2005, 10 patients with restenosis following ilio-femoral endovascular treatment underwent twelve cryoplasty procedures. All patients had had at least one previous episode of stenosis treated by conventional endovascular methods and had suffered further restenosis. The indications for treatment were grafts at risk (n=5) and symptomatic in-stent restenosis (n=5). Two patients underwent re-cryoplasty. Cryoplasty was performed in accordance with manufacturer's instructions using 6-8mm balloons. All patients had Doppler ultrasound evaluation at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months.All procedures had angiographically successful immediate outcome with <30% residual stenosis. Non flow limiting dissection was evident in two cases. In six procedures (50%), restenosis was evident within 6 months post-procedure, whilst in the other six, there was progressive restenosis appearing between 6-12 months. Five cryoplasty procedures have needed endovascular re-intervention due to symptomatic high-grade restenosis and a sixth is awaiting surgery.Cryoplasty is of no value in patients with restenosis in the iliofemoral segment with half the procedures failing within six months and all of them within the first year. Evidence to support the use of cryoplasty in the peripheral arterial restenotic lesions is lacking.
