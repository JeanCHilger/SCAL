Atherosclerosis, C-reactive protein, and risk for open-angle glaucoma: the Rotterdam study. To test the hypotheses that atherosclerosis and elevated serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are risk factors for open-angle glaucoma (OAG).In a prospective, population-based cohort study, all participants 55 years and older and at risk for incident OAG underwent, at baseline (1990-1993) and at follow-up (1997-1999), the same ophthalmic examination, including visual field testing and optic disc photography. Baseline atherosclerosis was assessed by means of echography of the carotid arteries, abdominal x-ray examination, and ankle-arm index baseline serum CRP levels were used in the analyses. The diagnosis of OAG was based on an algorithm using optic disc measures and visual field loss. Odds ratios of OAG were computed with logistic regression analyses. Risk factors were categorized in tertiles and according to standard deviation.After a mean follow-up of 6.5 years, incident OAG was diagnosed in 87 of 3842 (2.3%) participants at risk for OAG. Carotid artery plaques, carotid intima-media thickness, aortic calcifications, ankle-arm index, and CRP levels were not significant risk factors for OAG. The odds ratio, given for the highest and lowest tertiles, for carotid plaques was 1.43 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68-2.99), for carotid intima-media thickness 0.86 (95% CI, 0.47-1.57), for aortic calcifications 1.02 (95% CI, 0.60-1.75), for ankle-arm index 0.69 (95% CI, 0.38-1.25), and for CRP 1.19 (95% CI, 0.68-2.07).In this prospective, population-based study, neither atherosclerosis nor serum CRP level was an important risk factor for OAG.
