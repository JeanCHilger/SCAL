Effectiveness of a quality improvement intervention in blood pressure control in Primary Care. To evaluate the effectiveness of a quality improvement intervention on professionals sanitary in blood pressure control in hypertensive patients.Quality improvement trials with cuasi-experimental design. Two primary care health centres. One centre was assigned intervention group (7 family doctors and 419 patients) and the other was control group (7 family doctors and 419 patients). The quality improvement intervention consisted of a combined program comprising audit, feedback, training sessions about main hypertension clinical guidelines during 6 months. The main measurement were blood pressure, lipid levels, diabetes, smoking and body index mass, antihypertensive drugs and record treatment adherence and therapeutic plan in march 2002 the baseline measurement and march 2004 the post intervention.In study group blood pressure systolic and diastolic decreased 8.16/3.71 mmHg and control group increased 1.56/0.13 mmHg, respectively. The intervention effect was a drop of 9.72 mmHg (IC 95%: 7.50-11.94) and diastolic blood pressure in 3.84 mmHg (IC 95%: 2.40-5.28). The rate of hypertensive patients with blood pressure < 140/90 mmHg increased from 37.5% to 68.8% in study group, without changes in control group (p < 0.05). The drugs and combination drugs prescribed increased in both group, while the records of therapeutics plans and adherence increased only in intervention group (p < 0.05).The quality improvement intervention was associated to a systolic and diastolic blood pressure reduction and a increase of rate patients with blood pressure controlled.
