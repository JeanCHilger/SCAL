Non-linear dynamic analysis of the cardiac rhythm during transient myocardial ischemia. Coronary artery occlusions related to myocardial ischemia drive cardiac control system reactions that may lead to heart failure. The purpose of this study was to assess the autonomic nervous system (ANS) response during prolonged percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Continuous ECG data were acquired from 50 patients before and during PTCA, with occlusions in the left anterior descending, left circumflex or right coronary artery. Heart rate variability (HRV) was analyzed for 3-min segments of the R-R interval signal obtained from ECG data. The ANS behavior was evaluated by HRV analysis using fractal-like indices. The fractal scalar exponent alpha(1) and power-law slope beta decreased considerably during PTCA. This indicates that significant reactions of autonomic control of the heart rate occurred during coronary artery occlusions, with a reduction in complexity of the ANS.
