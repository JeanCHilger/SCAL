New technique of magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate peripheral circulation in diabetic patients. Waveform analysis at the popliteal artery using the new technique of gated two-dimensional cine-mode phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging is beneficial to assess peripheral circulation in both normal and diseased arteries. The normal subjects had a typically triphasic waveform, which could be clearly separated into systolic, and early and late diastolic phases of the cardiac cycle. Diabetic patients are reported to have two types of insufficient arterial blood flow to the lower limbs associated with the vessel wall properties. Firstly, patients with atherosclerotic occlusion in the lower-leg arteries distal to the aortic bifurcation, resulting in a low ankle-brachial index, show an abnormal monophasic waveform. Secondly, patients with stiffer arteries characteristically show abnormal flow reversal in late diastole, suggesting higher vascular resistance.
