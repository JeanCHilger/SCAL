Estimation of the functional role of arterial pathways to the buttock circulation during treadmill walking in patients with claudication. The aim of the study was to estimate the functional contribution of the arterial inflow pathways to the pelvic circulation during walking in patients with stage 2 lower extremity arterial disease. Transcutaneous oxygen pressure (Ptc(O(2))) changes during exercise can be used to estimate the severity of regional blood flow impairment while walking. Seventy patients with stable lower limb claudication were studied using a multivariate linear regression model. The relationship between exercise-induced buttock Ptc(O(2)) changes, the ipsilateral calf Ptc(O(2)) changes, and the arterial diameters of the pelvic arteriographic pathways were analyzed. The ipsilateral hypogastric and lumbar pathway, as well as the ipsilateral calf Ptc(O(2)) changes, were the only variables significantly related to buttock Ptc(O(2)) changes (r = 0.47 P < 0.001). Their normalized respective contribution to the regressive model was 39%, 19%, and 18%. None of the contralateral hypogastric, mesenteric, and sacral pathways or pathways stemming from the external iliac artery showed significant correlation to buttock Ptc(O(2)) changes. The ipsilateral hypogastric and ipsilateral lumbar pathways are the major pathways responsible for the functional buttock blood flow supply during walking. The role of contralateral hypogastric, inferior mesenteric, and median sacral pathways and arteries distal to the internal iliac trunk is negligible in the normal or compensatory blood flow supply. Distal Ptc(O(2)) decrease at exercise aggravates proximal Ptc(O(2)) decrease, possibly through the occurrence of a "steal phenomenon" of distal over proximal circulation during walking.
