Serum amyloid P and cardiovascular disease in older men and women: results from the Cardiovascular Health Study. Serum amyloid P (SAP), a pentraxin like C-reactive protein (CRP), functions in innate immunity. However, associations of SAP with cardiovascular disease (CVD) are unknown.We examined these associations in the Cardiovascular Health Study using a case-cohort design. Nonexclusive case groups were incident angina (n=523), myocardial infarction (MI n=308), stroke (n=323), and CVD death (n=288). 786 participants had no events. SAP was correlated with CRP, CVD risk factors (obesity, blood pressure, lipids), common and internal carotid wall thickness, and ankle-brachial index (all P<0.02). In Cox regression models adjusted for age, sex, and ethnicity, a standard deviation increase in SAP (9.8 mg/L) was associated with angina (hazard ratioAlthough both are pentraxins, SAP and CRP may represent different facets of inflammation. The association of SAP with CVD in these older adults further supports the role of innate immunity in atherosclerosis.
