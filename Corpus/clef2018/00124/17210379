Plaque excision with the Silverhawk catheter: early results in patients with claudication or critical limb ischemia. This study was conducted to detail the early experience after infrainguinal atherectomy using the Silverhawk plaque excision catheter for the treatment of symptomatic peripheral vascular disease.A prospective database was established in August 2004 in which data for operations, outcomes, and follow-up were recorded for patients undergoing percutaneous plaque excision for peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) ischemia scores and femoropopliteal TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) criteria were assigned. A follow-up protocol included duplex ultrasound surveillance at 1, 3, and 6 months and then yearly thereafter. Standard statistical analyses were performed.During a 17-month period, 66 limbs of 60 patients (37 men [61.7%]) underwent 70 plaque excisions (four repeat procedures). Indications included tissue loss based on SVS ischemia at grades 5 and 6 (25/70), rest pain at grade 4 (22/70), and claudication at grades 2 to 3 (23/70). The mean lesion length was 8.8 +/- 0.7 cm. The technical success rate was 87.1% (61/70). Adjunctive treatment was required in 17 procedures (24.3%), consisting of 14 balloon angioplasties and three stents. Femoropopliteal TASC criteria included 5 TASC A lesions, 14 TASC B lesions, 32 TASC C lesions, and 19 TASC D lesions. Although 17 plaque excisions included a tibial vessel, no patient underwent isolated tibial atherectomy. The mean increase in ankle-brachial index was 0.27 +/- 0.04 and in toe pressure, 20.3 +/- 6.9 mm Hg. Mean duplex ultrasound follow-up was 5.2 months (range, 1 to 17 months). One-year primary, primary assisted, and secondary patency was 61.7%, 64.1%, and 76.4%, respectively. Restenosis or occlusion developed in 12 patients (16.7%) and was detected at a mean of 2.8 +/- 0.7 months. Restenosis or occlusion was significantly more common (P < .05) in patients with TASC C and D lesions compared with patients with TASC A and B lesions. Six (8.3%) of 12 patients underwent reintervention on the basis of duplex ultrasound surveillance results. Four (33.3%) of 12 patients experienced reocclusion during the same hospitalization, and amputation and open revascularization were required in two patients each.Percutaneous plaque excision is a viable treatment option for lower extremity revascularization. Outcomes are related to ischemia and lesion severity. Patency and limb salvage rates are equivalent to other endovascular modalities.
