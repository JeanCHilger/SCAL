Limb hemodynamics are not predictive of functional capacity in patients with PAD. To the practicing clinician, it seems obvious that limb hemodynamics would be the primary determinant of walking distance. However, other determinants, such as skeletal muscle metabolism, may play a role. Accordingly, in the current study, we examined the relationship between measures of limb hemodynamics and walking capacity in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). We measured toe and ankle pressures for calculation of toe- (TBI) and ankle (ABI)-brachial indices basal and hyperemic calf blood flow (CBF
