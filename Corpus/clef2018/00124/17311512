Evaluation of cardiovascular risk factors and related clinical markers in healthy young Japanese adults. Since atherosclerosis is a slowly progressive process at a young age, effective preventive measures should be taken early in life to prevent future events associated with cardiovascular disease.The study population comprised 132 young Japanese adults (mean age 21.4 years, range 18-31 years). We screened plasma total homocysteine and serum folate levels and evaluated mean carotid intima-media thickness and cardio-ankle vascular index.Multiple regression analysis after adjustment for age and sex revealed that only folate levels were significantly correlated with plasma total homocysteine levels (beta=-0.37, p=0.028). Carotid intima-media thickness adjusted for age and sex and compared between quintiles of total homocysteine levels was significantly increased in the highest quintile compared with other quintiles. Cardio-ankle vascular index increased with age in both women and men, but no additional determinants were identified in young adults.Serum folate is an independent determinant of plasma total homocysteine levels, and mild hyperhomocysteinemia may represent a risk factor for increased carotid intima-media thickness, even in young adults. Comprehensive health education from the early period of life, including the suggestion of appropriate dietary measures, is important for effective prevention of future atherosclerosis.
