Coronary-subclavian steal: case series and review of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies: three case reports. Due to the increased use of internal mammary artery grafts for coronary revascularization, proximal subclavian stenosis resulting in coronary-subclavian steal has become an important clinical entity. Patients present with varying signs and symptoms of recurrent myocardial ischemia that not only can limit lifestyle but also be life-threatening. A careful history and physical examination with the identification of risk factors such as peripheral vascular disease and arm blood pressure differential >20 mm Hg can identify patents at high risk for developing this syndrome. Identifying these patients before coronary artery bypass grafting can prevent this important problem by altering the therapeutic approach to coronary revascularization. When patients present after coronary artery bypass grafting with coronary-subclavian steal, therapeutic options of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stent placement to the subclavian artery, carotid-subclavian bypass, and axillary-axillary bypass all have high success rates with excellent long-term patency rates. The choice for the type of revascularization needs to be individualized based on the lesion morphology and clinical comorbidities. Three patients who presented with signs and symptoms of myocardial ischemia due to coronary subclavian steal are presented. All 3 patients had incapacitating symptoms, and all 3 were treated successfully with different revascularization techniques due to other medical conditions or comorbidities.
