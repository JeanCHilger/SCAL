Assessment of lower limb ischemia with measurement of skin perfusion pressure in patients on hemodialysis. Measurement of skin perfusion pressure (SPP) using laser Doppler has become available for the assessment of peripheral arterial disease. We studied whether measurements of SPP can be used to identify hemodialyzed patients with peripheral arterial disease by comparing it with measurements of the ankle brachial pressure index (ABI). The ABI at rest and the SPP in the foot were measured in 59 Japanese hemodialyzed patients (118 limbs). Twenty-one patients had diabetes mellitus. Five had intermittent claudication however, 20 patients were accompanied by other exertional leg symptoms. The SPP could not be measured in three limbs because of involuntary movement due to previous stroke or restless leg syndrome. The SPP was correlated with the ABI. Depending upon these results of the ABI, the 114 limbs from which both the ABI and the SPP could measured were divided into three groups: (A) ABI > or = 1.3, (B) 0.9 < or = ABI < 1.3, and (C) ABI < 0.9. The average SPP of group C was significantly decreased among the three groups. All subjects of the three groups were divided into an extra two groups according to the presence of diabetes (non-diabetes groups, -I
