Supervised exercise training for intermittent claudication: lasting benefit at three years. To assess the long-term outcome of supervised exercise training for intermittent claudication.A prospective study was undertaken of all patients referred to a single centre with intermittent claudication (>46 m). Patients underwent supervised exercise training twice weekly for 10 weeks, with regular follow-up to 3 years. Actual Claudication Distance (ACD), Maximum Walking Distance (MWD) and ankle-brachial pressure indices (ABPI) were measured.In 202 patients the initial median ACD and MWD were 112 m and 197 m. Following exercise therapy both the median ACD and MWD increased to 266 m and 477 m at three months, increases of 237% and 242% respectively (p<0.001). At three years the median ACD and MWD were 250 m and 372 m, increases of 223% and 188% respectively (p<0.001). There was no significant change in ACD or MWD at 3 months compared to 1, 2 or 3 years. ABPI remained unchanged throughout.Supervised exercise training has long term benefit in patients with intermittent claudication. Results seen at 12 weeks are sustained at three years.
