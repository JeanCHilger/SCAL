Modification of vascular risk factors by intervention on the primary care level. Results of the INVADE project. The so-called INVADE project examines the efficacy of consistent diagnosis and treatment of cerebrovascular risk factors on the incidence of stroke.This analysis compares known cardiovascular risk factors (elevated blood pressure, dipositas, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and smoking) and respective medication of 2930 patients with respect to cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and coronary heart disease (CHD) between baseline and follow-up examination after 2 years of intervention.Using the ankle-brachial index (ABI), 381 patients (13%) with asymptomatic PAD were identified. Comparison between baseline and follow-up examination revealed significant reductions in the following risk factors. Cerebrovascular disease: elevated blood pressure -12.8%, dipositas -4.2%, and LDL -8.1%. For PAD the results were: elevated blood pressure -7.2%, smoking -1.2%, elevated cholesterol -6.4%, dipositas -3.2%, and LDL -7.4%. For CHD the results were: elevated blood pressure -11.3%, elevated cholesterol -13.0%, and LDL -14.9%.By the use of ABI, previously undiagnosed asymptomatic PAD was identified in 13% of all patients. Two-year intervention on the primary care level yielded significant reduction of known vascular risk factors.
