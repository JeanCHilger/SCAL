Role of sympathectomy in upper-limb critical ischaemia induced by distal lesion of arteries. The work was based on the experience gained in treatment of 40 patients with degree IV ischaemia of the upper extremities, induced by involvement of the distal arterial bed. Assessing blood circulation in the upper extremities included rheovasography, laser Doppler flowmetry with functional loads, and transcutaneous oxygenometry. Analyzing the obtained findings became it possible to draw a conclusion that the upper thoracic sympathectomy is an efficacious method of treatment for upper limb ischaemia secondary to the lesions of the distal arterial bed. This operative intervention turned out to be most efficient in patients with Raynaud's syndrome.
