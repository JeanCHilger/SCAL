Percutaneous rotational and aspiration atherectomy in infrainguinal peripheral arterial occlusive disease: a multicenter pilot study. To report a safety and efficacy study of the first rotational aspiration atherectomy system (Pathway PV) for the treatment of arterial lesions below the femoral bifurcation.From December 2005 to February 2006, 15 patients (9 men mean age 71+/-9 years) with Rutherford stage 2 to 5 lower limb ischemia were enrolled at 3 study sites. Target lesions were in the superficial femoral (n = 7, 47%), popliteal (n = 7, 47%), and posterior tibial (n = 1, 6%) arteries. Mean diameter stenosis was 97%+/-10%Interventional success (residual stenosis <30%) was achieved in all lesions (100%). Stand alone atherectomy was performed in 6 (40%) patients, adjunctive balloon angioplasty in 7 (47%), and stenting/endografting in 2 (13%). The SAE rate at 30 days was 20% (3/15), including 1 perforation due to an unrecognized displacement of the guidewire (sealed with an endograft), 1 false aneurysm at the puncture site (successful duplex-guided compression therapy), and 1 dissection in conjunction with a distal embolism (stent implantation and aspiration thrombectomy). Primary patency rates measured by duplex ultrasound at 1 and 6 months were 100% and 73%, respectively the TLR rate was 0% after 6 months. The ankle-brachial index increased significantly from 0.54+/-0.3 at baseline to 0.89+/-0.16, 0.88+/-0.19, and 0.81+/-0.20 (p<0.05) at discharge, 1 month, and 6 months, respectively. Mean Rutherford categories were 2.92+/-1.19 (range 1-5), 0.64+/-1.12 (range 0-1), and 0.83+/-1.33 (range 0-3) at the same time points (p<0.05).The application of this new atherectomy device was feasible in all cases. The serious adverse event rate was moderate however, all events were solved during the index procedure. The 0% 6-month TLR rate is promising.
