In situ femoro-popliteal bypass grafts. Study of 85 cases using Cartier's technique. From January 1985 to december 1989, 83 patients (69 men, 14 women) underwent an in situ femoro-popliteal bypass using a semi-closed technique and the valvulotome developed by Dr Paul Cartier. Most patients (67%) were operated for severe ischemia while 33% were for claudication. HTA was present in 31% of patients, diabetes in 38% and CAD in 57%. Mean preoperative ABI was 0.33 +/- 0.20 and mean ankle pressure was 50 +/- 30 mm of Hg. Arteriographic popliteal run-off showed three vessels in 21 cases (25%), two vessels in 17 cases (20%) and one vessel in 38 cases (45%). Nine patients (10%) presented an isolated popliteal artery. Bypass was constructed below knee in 62 patients (73%) and above knee in 23 (27%). Five mortalities (5.8%) and two major complications (2.3%) were related to surgery. Four early graft failures (4.4%) were noted but 3 were successfully reoperated. Postoperative ABI was 0.71 +/- 0.23 mm of Hg and 81% of patients had complete relief of their symptoms. With a mean follow-up 19 months, graft patency was 91% +/- 6% and 84% +/- 11% at one and two years and was not influenced by operative indication: hypertension, diabetes, preoperative ABI, arteriographic findings or distal anastomotic site. Overall survival was 80% +/- 10% and 69 +/- 13 at one and two years. The in situ technique using the Cartier valvulotomes is an excellent operation and compares favourably with other techniques.
