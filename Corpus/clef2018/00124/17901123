Human cutaneous reactive hyperaemia: role of BKCa channels and sensory nerves. Reactive hyperaemia is the increase in blood flow following arterial occlusion. The exact mechanisms mediating this response in skin are not fully understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate the individual and combined contributions of (1) sensory nerves and large-conductance calcium activated potassium (BKCa) channels, and (2) nitric oxide (NO) and prostanoids to cutaneous reactive hyperaemia. Laser-Doppler flowmetry was used to measure skin blood flow in a total of 18 subjects. Peak blood flow (BF) was defined as the highest blood flow value after release of the pressure cuff. Total hyperaemic response was calculated by taking the area under the curve (AUC) of the hyperaemic response minus baseline. Infusates were perfused through forearm skin using microdialysis in four sites. In the sensory nerve/BKCa protocol: (1) EMLA cream (EMLA, applied topically to skin surface), (2) tetraethylammonium (TEA), (3) EMLA + TEA (Combo), and (4) Ringer solution (Control). In the prostanoid/NO protocol: (1) ketorolac (Keto), (2) NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), (3) Keto + l-NAME (Combo), and (4) Ringer solution (Control). CVC was calculated as flux/mean arterial pressure and normalized to maximal flow. Hyperaemic responses in Control (1389 +/- 794%CVC max s) were significantly greater compared to TEA, EMLA and Combo sites (TEA, 630 +/- 512, P = 0.003 EMLA, 421 +/- 216, P < 0.001
