Coiling of the right external iliac artery with atherosclerotic plaque as a cause of ischemic ulcer on the toe: report of a case. Coiling of the artery is a rare morphologic entity, most frequently found in the internal carotid arteries. Coiling of other arteries is rarely reported because it is usually asymptomatic. We report a case of 360 degrees coiling of the right external iliac artery found by color duplex scan and arteriography. The patient was a 72-year-old man who presented with a 2-month history of an ischemic ulcer on his right toe and a right ankle-brachial-pressure index (ABPI) of 0.0 and 0.4 on admission. We resected 7 cm of the affected artery and performed end-to-end reconstruction. After 2 months of follow-up, his ischemic ulcer had healed and the ABPI of the right foot was 0.0 and 0.8.
