Direct association between C-reactive protein serum levels and endothelial dysfunction in patients with claudication. To evaluate the relationship between C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP), a serum marker of inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction in patients with intermittent claudication.Cross-sectional study with stratified sampling on dependent variables of age, genre, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, smoking status and ankle-brachial index (ABI) to select 156 patients from a target population of 4,100 patients with claudication. We assessed the flow-mediated arterial dilation (FMAD) as a reporter of endothelial function and plasma levels of hsCRP and fibrinogen.Patients with a FMAD<3% (range for the lowest 5% of healthy subjects) had increased levels of plasma hsCRP (6.3 vs 2.3mg/L p<0.05) and fibrinogen (351vs 302mg/LImpaired endothelial dysfunction is association with increased plasma concentrations of inflammatory markers, and both may have a role in the aetiopathogenesis of peripheral arterial disease.
