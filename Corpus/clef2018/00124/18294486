Association of premature ventricular complexes with central aortic pressure indices and pulse wave velocity. Although premature ventricular complex (PVC) occurs frequently, its predisposing factors have rarely been studied. We examined the connection between PVC and aortic stiffness.We recruited 200 consecutive patients (< 50 years, 95 men, mean age 36 +/- 10 years) who received a 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiography examination for palpitation and PVC loads. Muscular artery pulse wave velocity (PWVm) and 4 main aortic pressure indices-augmented pressure, augmentation index (AI(x)), AI(x) corrected for a steady heart rate of 75 beat/min, and the extra workload-were measured, and atherosclerosis risk was evaluated.Eighty-three (42%) patients had no PVC loads 58 (29%) patients had low loads (< 24 beat/d), and 59 (29%) had high loads (> or = 24 beat/d). Only age and hyperlipidemia were significantly associated with PVC loads. Using a multivariate logistic regression model adjusted for potential confounders, we found that AI(x) (odds ratio [OR] 1.88, 95% CI 1.20-2.91, P = .005)Increased central aortic pressure indices as well as PWVm were associated with increased PVC loads in young patients undergoing 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiography. Central aortic properties probably contributed to the occurrence of PVC.
