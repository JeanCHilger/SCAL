Vascular diseases: what screening could be done in the office?. The screening of vascular pathologies in physician offices starts with precise medical history and clinical exam. Tools like the Edinburgh Claudication Questionnaire for the peripheral artery disease or the Wells score for the probability of a thromboembolic event are useful. The measure of the ankle brachial index, the D-dimers or any other biological screening are complementary. In the presence of pathological features, it is recommended to organise a specialised consultation in order to precise diagnosis, treatment and follow-up. The screening of a vascular disease is interesting not only for the management of local symptoms, but also for the associated systemic pathologies to provide a preventive medicine of good quality.
