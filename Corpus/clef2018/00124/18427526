Prediction of critical lower limb ischemia at the patients with lower limb arteries atherosclerosis. Arterial inflow, venous outflow and microcirculation were studied with ultrasound Doppler, photopletismography and oxygen partial pressure detection at 115 patients with lower limb arteries atherosclerosis and different stages of limb ischemia. Four-level algorithm of critical limb ischemia prediction has been created. First level is the study of arterial inflow. Gradient of regional systolic blood pressure >or=2.0 is the critical parameter. Second level is the study of venous outflow. Critical parameter - gradient of postocclusive venous pressure >or=3.0. Third level is the ratio of arterial and venous blood flow. Venous-arterial index >or=40% demonstrates critical disturbances of macrohemodynamics. Fourth level is the study of microcirculation. If the capillary gradient <or=29%, index of elasticity <or= 27%, photopletismography index <or=28% and transcutaneous oxygen partial pressure <or= 20 mm Hg than the surgical treatment is indicated.
