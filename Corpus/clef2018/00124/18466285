Helicobacter pylori infection does not accelerate the age-related progression of arteriosclerosis: a 4-year follow-up study. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection has been reported to correlate with the onset of cardiovascular diseases. However, the relationship between H. pylori infection and the progression of arteriosclerosis has not been fully investigated. The aim of this study was to clarify the possible role of H. pylori infection in the development of arteriosclerosis.Study subjects were 258 cases who attended their annual medical check-ups and were twice investigated by the parameters of arteriosclerosis at a 4-year interval. Arteriosclerotic parameters (systolic blood pressure [SBP]), ankle brachial index [ABI], and pulse wave velocity [PWV]) were measured non-invasively using an automatic device. H. pylori-infection status was determined by assaying serum anti-H. pylori IgG antibodies. The changes in the arteriosclerotic parameters during the 4 years were compared between H. pylori-seropositive and seronegative individuals.A total of 166 subjects (64.3%) were H. pylori-seropositive. After adjustment for gender, age, body mass index, and smoking and drinking habits, there were no differences in any of the arteriosclerotic parameters between the groups, not only at enrollment but after the 4 years, although the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of the seropositive groups were significantly lower than those of seronegative groups. SBP and PWVs were significantly increased during 4 years in both the seropositive and seronegative groups. The percentage of changes in SBP and PWVs, which were calculated by ([values after 4 years--values at enrollment/values at enrollment] x 100), did not differ between the groups.H. pylori infection does not accelerate the age-related progression of arteriosclerosis in Japanese individuals.
