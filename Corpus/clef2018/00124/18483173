Human cardiorespiratory and cerebrovascular function during severe passive hyperthermia: effects of mild hypohydration. The influence of severe passive heat stress and hypohydration (Hypo) on cardiorespiratory and cerebrovascular function is not known. We hypothesized that 1) heating-induced hypocapnia and peripheral redistribution of cardiac output (Q) would compromise blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (MCAv) and cerebral oxygenation 2) Hypo would exacerbate the hyperthermic-induced hypocapnia, further decreasing MCAv
