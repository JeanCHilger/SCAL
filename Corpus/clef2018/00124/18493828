Percutaneous treatment of complete chronic occlusions of the superficial femoral artery. This study was done to evaluate the mid-and long-term patency rates of complete (from the origin to Hunter's duct) chronic occlusions of the superficial femoral artery (SFA) treated by angioplasty and/or stenting.From February 2002 to March 2005, 21 patients with complete occlusion of the SFA and good distal runoff (two or three patent vessels) were treated with endovascular recanalisation. All patients had severe claudication or critical limb ischaemia. In all cases, recanalisation was performed with a contralateral approach by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), with stenting only when PTA provided unsatisfactory results (due to elastic recoil and complications such as dissection). In the case of calcified occlusions and when the true lumen of the SFA could not be crossed, subintimal angioplasty was performed. Follow-up was done at 6 and 12 months and annually thereafter (range 6-55 months, mean 23 months) with clinical evaluation and colour-Doppler ultrasound.Immediate technical success was achieved in all cases (100%), with post-procedural angiography demonstrating complete recanalisation of the SFA. Two distal embolisation (9.5%) occurred, both treated successfully by local thrombolysis. Primary patency rates at 6, 12, 24, 32 and 44 months were 93.3%, 69.2%, 72.7%, 62.5% and 40%, respectively secondary patency rates at 6, 12 and 24 months were 100%, 84.6% and 81.8%, respectively.Percutaneous treatment of complete chronic occlusions of the SFA showed good mid-and long-term primary patency rates, with few periprocedural complications. Re-occlusions can be treated by a percutaneous technique, which ensures a good secondary patency rate.
