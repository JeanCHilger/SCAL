The cardiovascular effects of upper-limb aerobic exercise in hypertensive patients. Aerobic exercise is broadly recommended as a helpful adjunct to obtain blood pressure control in hypertension. Several hypertensive patients, however, are limited by musculoskeletal complaints or vascular occlusive disease from lower-limb exercise such as jogging or cycling. In the present randomized-controlled study, we evaluate whether an aerobic arm-cycling program provides a measurable cardiovascular benefit.Twenty-four probands were randomly assigned to sedentary activity or a heart rate controlled 12 week exercise program, consisting of arm-cycling at target lactate concentrations of 2.0 +/- 0.5 mmol/l. Endothelial function was assessed by flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery. Augmentation index and large/small artery compliance (C(1) and C(2)) were measured by computerized pulse-wave analysis of the radial artery.The exercise program led to a significant reduction in systolic (134.0 +/- 20.0 to 127.0 +/- 16.4 mmHg P = 0.03) and diastolic blood pressure (73.0 +/- 21.6 to 67.1 +/- 8.2 mmHgRegular arm aerobic exercise leads to a marked reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressures and an improvement in small artery compliance. Arm-cycling is a reasonable option for hypertensive patients who want to support blood pressure control by sports despite having coxarthrosis, gonarthrosis, or intermittent claudication.
