Growth hormone (GH) treatment does not restore endothelial function in children with GH deficiency. In adults with growth hormone (GH) deficiency (GHD), GH treatment restores impaired endothelial function, a precursor of cardiovascular disease. Its effect in children with GHD is unknown.Three months of GH (0.3 mg/kg/wk) were given to nine children with GHD. Endothelial function was measured via reactive hyperemic response. Forearm blood flow (FBF, strain gauge plethysmography) was measured before and after 5 min of upper arm arterial occlusion. Blood pressure and lipid, insulin and glucose levels were measured. Pretreatment endothelial function was compared to 18 previously studied control children.Percent fall in forearm vascular resistance was greater in controls (81.2 +/- 1.9%) than in children with GHD (69.6 +/- 5.3%, p = 0.021) but was not affected by GH (60.6 +/- 7.5%). GH markedly increased HOMAIR (21 +/- 7 versus 43 +/- 8, p = 0.004). Plasma lipid levels did not significantly differ.These results indicate that endothelial function is impaired in children with GHD. GH therapy does not restore the impairment.
