Reference data for distal blood pressure in healthy elderly and middle-aged individuals measured with the strain gauge technique. Part II: Distal blood pressure after exercise. Distal blood pressure (DBP) determination after an exercise test is used on suspicion of arterial peripheral vascular disease (apvd). In our department. the average age of these patients is about 60 years. The usual reference values for pressures after exercise were based on data collected in the early 1970s from healthy individuals in the age range 21-26 years. Our aims were to collect new reference data for DBP at ankle level after exercise based on older populations, and to compare between reference data for different age groups to find out whether the normal values are dependent on age.DBP after exercise was measured using the strain-gauge technique on individuals in two groups: group I comprising 25 healthy persons aged between 61 and 82 years, and group II 14 healthy persons aged between 45 and 58 years. Strict rules of inclusion were followed.Normal values are dependent on age. The average differences (ankle DBP(after)-ankle DBP(before)) immediately after walking were 25 mmHg, 12 mmHg and -8 mmHg in group I, group II and the old data, respectively. Comparison among groups showed significant differences (p< or =0.01).Normal values for elderly and middle-aged persons are presented. Use of normal values based on young people may result in underestimation of DBP response and hence underestimation of the degree of possible apvd, especially in elderly individuals.
