Polydeoxyribonucleotide (PDRN) restores blood flow in an experimental model of peripheral artery occlusive disease. This study investigated whether polydeoxyribonucleotide (PDRN) may be efficacious in the treatment of peripheral artery occlusive diseases, which are a major cause of morbidity in Western countries and still lack standardized treatment.We investigated the effects of PDRN, a mixture of deoxyribonucleotides, in an experimental model of hind limb ischemia (HLI) in rats to stimulate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A production and to avoid critical ischemia. The femoral artery was excised to induce HLI. Sham-operated on rats (sham HLI) were used as controls. Animals were treated daily with intraperitoneal PDRN (8 mg/kg) or its vehicle. Animals were euthanized at day 7, 14, and 21 after the evaluation of blood flow by laser Doppler. Dissected muscles were used to measure VEGF-A messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression, to evaluate edema, and to assess histologic damage.Administration of PDRN dramatically increased VEGF mRNA throughout the study (day 14: HLI, 7 +/- 2.2 n-fold/beta-actin HLI + PDRN, 13.3 +/- 3.8 n-fold/beta-actinThese results led us to hypothesize a role for PDRN in treating peripheral artery occlusive diseases.
