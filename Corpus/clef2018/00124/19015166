Hypercoagulability markers in patients with peripheral arterial disease: association to ankle-brachial index. Peripheral arterial disease is diagnosed by measuring the ankle-brachial index. Values lower than 0.90 define the disease being usually related to its severity. Patients with peripheral arterial disease may show a hypercoagulability state. The aim of this study was to assess hemostatic variables and to correlate them with the presence of peripheral arterial disease and its severity as assessed by ankle-brachial index values. Plasma levels of D dimer, plasminogen, prothrombin fragment 1+2, plasminogen activator inhibitor and thrombomodulin were measured in 36 patients with peripheral arterial disease (group 1) and 30 without disease (group 2). Significant differences for D dimer, plasminogen, prothrombin fragment 1+2 and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 between the 2 groups were found (P<0.05). Significant and inverse correlations were also observed (Pearson correlation, P<0.05) between ankle-brachial index values and levels of both plasminogen and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1. Although there was no significant correlation between ankle-brachial index and levels of D dimer, higher D dimer values were observed in patients with lower ankle-brachial index values. The results confirm a trend to hypercoagulability and hypofibrinolysis in patients with peripheral arterial disease. Increased levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 seem to be associated with the severity of the disease, considering the inverse correlation between this inhibitor and ankle-brachial index.
