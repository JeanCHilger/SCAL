Increased arterial stiffness correlated with disease activity in systemic lupus erythematosus. To evaluate the relationships between arterial stiffness, disease activity and end-organ damage in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), non-invasive vascular assessments were made on 32 female SLE patients and 32 female normal controls. The patients had significantly increased brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (PWV) (13.06 +/- 1.79 vs. 11.50 +/- 1.00 m/s P < 0.001), heart-ankle PWV (8.98 +/- 1.16 vs. 7.88 +/- 0.73 m/s
