Chronic plaque psoriasis is associated with increased arterial stiffness. Patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis have a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and atherosclerosis. Arterial stiffness is a measure of endothelial dysfunction and an independent predictor of cardiovascular events.To investigate whether chronic plaque psoriasis is associated with an increased arterial stiffness.A cross-sectional study on 39 adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis and 38 control patients with skin diseases other than psoriasis was conducted. Arterial stiffness was assessed by carotid-femoral and carotid-radial pulse wave velocity (PWVcf, PWVcr).PWVcf was significantly higher in patients with psoriasis than in controls (means +/- SD 8.88 +/- 1.96 vs. 7.57 +/- 1.34 m/sModerate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis may be independently associated with increased arterial stiffness. Psoriasis duration could be a risk factor for arterial stiffness and atherosclerosis.
