Non-controllable blood pressure peaks--pheochromocytoma?. A 59-year old patient presented with a history of arterial hypertension, refractory to combined antihypertensive treatment with ACE-inhibitors, diuretics, calcium channel blockers and beta blockers. Blood pressure values ranged from 180/100mmHg to 90mmHg systolic after medication intake. Diagnostic work-up revealed renal artery stenosis on duplexsonography that was treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stent implantation. After the intervention, blood pressure values remained normal even without antihypertensive treatment.
