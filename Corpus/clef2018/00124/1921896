Hemodynamic effects of intermittent intra-arterial infusion treatment with prostaglandin E1 in peripheral arterial occlusive disease. 14 femoral arteries of twelve patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (Fontaine stage II: n = 4, stage III/IV: n = 10) were investigated before, immediately after a series of 26 (ten to 52) intraarterial infusions with prostaglandin E1, and 30 weeks later. Using combined B-mode and pulsed Doppler (duplex) ultrasound blood flow measurements were performed in the common femoral, the superficial femoral, and the deep femoral artery. There was a significant decrease of resting blood flow volume in the common femoral artery after therapy (418.5----362.2 [p less than 0.01]----324.5 ml/min [p less than 0.05]) in the group of patients treated successfully. The peak flow (maximum value of blood flow volume during reactive hyperaemia) in the common femoral artery increased significantly after therapy (597.3----779.1 [p less than 0.05]----843.7 ml/min). The increase of peak flow correlated well with clinical improvement. Other parameters (blood flow velocities, pulse rise time, pulse decrease time, pulsatility index) changed without correlation to clinical outcome. The increase of peak flow after therapy might be caused by an improved collateral circulation, and the decrease of resting blood flow might be due to metabolic effects of prostaglandin E1 (improved oxygen utilization).
