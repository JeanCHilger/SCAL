Predictive factors of femoropopliteal patency after suboptimal duplex-guided balloon angioplasty and stenting: is recoil a bad sign? Currently, the value of stenting during femoropopliteal balloon angioplasty (FPBA) remains unclear. Herein we evaluate the patency rates of successful duplex-guided balloon angioplasty (DAGBA) alone versus suboptimal DAGBA followed by stenting and the prestenting dissection versus recoil as potential indicators of stent success or failure. Over a period of 27 months, we performed 291 duplex-guided FPBAs (194 stenoses 97 occlusions) on 244 limbs in 220 patients. Disabling claudication was the indication in 67%. Critical limb ischemia was the indication in the remaining 33%. Self-expanding nitinol stents were used when plaque dissection and/ or recoil caused diameter reduction > or = 40%. Serial follow-up duplex scans were obtained. Severe restenosis (> 70%) was measured by B-mode imaging and a peak systolic velocity ratio > 3. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 41 months (mean 10 +/- 8.3 months). The overall mean interval for restenosis and occlusion was 6.5 +/- 4.2 months and 5.6 +/- 6.1 months, respectively. Stents did affect overall patency results compared with not using stents. Reasons for stenting were plaque recoil, dissection, or both in 98 (53%), 44 (24%), and 42 (23%) cases, respectively. Six-month patency was 59%, 94%, and 69%, respectively. The difference between plaque recoil and dissection was significant (p<.04). The use of stents during FPBA may be associated with balloon angioplasty site failure in the femoropopliteal segment. To our knowledge, this is the first report ever to document plaque recoil as a predictor of balloon angioplasty site failure notwithstanding stent placement.
