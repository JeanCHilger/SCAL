Correlation between lower-extremity functional status and obesity in type-II diabetic patients with and without peripheral arterial disease at Dr. Sardjito Central General Hospital, Yogyakarta. To recognize the correlation between lower-extremity functional status and obesity in patients with type-2 DM with PAD complication (with and without peripheral arterial disease).the study was a cross-sectional study conducted at Outpatients Clinic of Internal Medicine, Dr. Sardjito Central General Hospital in August-December 2006. Fifty-five subjects who were patients with type-2 DM aged more than 50 years agreed to participate and were eligible for the study while the exclusion criteria included smoking, diabetic ulcer or gangrene, history of amputation due to diabetic ulcer or gangrene. The diagnosis of PAD was based on Ankle Brachial Index < 0.90.mean age was 62.53 +/- 6.82 years old and mean value of BMI was 24.26 +/- 3.57 kg/m2, 18 subjects (32.7%) were obese. The proportion of obese subjects with PAD was higher compared to the non-obese subjects (41% vs. 27%, p = 0.372). Lower-extremity functional status of type-2 diabetic patients either with or without PAD in obese subjects needs longer period of time (7.17 +/- 1.74 minute and 6.94 +/- 1.48 minute vs. 5.13 +/- 1.47 minute and 4.58 +/- 1.17 minute, p < 0.05 and p < 0.001).the functional status of lower extremities in obese patients with DM is poorer than the non-obese subjects.
