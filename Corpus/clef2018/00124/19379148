Risk factors of normal ankle-brachial index and low toe-brachial index in hemodialysis patients. The prevalence of peripheral arterial occlusive disease is high in patients with terminal renal failure, and it is a major problem in those on dialysis. A low ankle-brachial index (ABI) suggests the presence of arterial stenotic lesions between the aorta and the ankle joint, while a low toe-brachial index (TBI) suggests stenotic lesions between the aorta and the toes. Therefore, a normal ABI (> or =0.9) and a low TBI (<0.6) may indicate the presence of stenotic lesions located only on the peripheral side of the ankle joint. In the present study, risk factors of normal ABI/low TBI were investigated. In 115 patients on maintenance dialysis, the ABI and TBI were simultaneously measured, and the background factors and laboratory data of patients with normal ABI/low TBI (L group) and those with normal ABI/normal TBI (> or =0.6) (N group) were compared. Low ankle-brachial and toe-brachial indices were detected in 13% and 22% of the patients, respectively. Comparison of the background factors and laboratory data between the N and L groups showed that the ratio of diabetes mellitus, interdialytic body weight gain, and Hb(A1c) values were significantly higher in the L group than in the N group. It was clarified that diabetes and excess body weight gain are involved as risk factors in dialysis patients with normal ABI/low TBI.
