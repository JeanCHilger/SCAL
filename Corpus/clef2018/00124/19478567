Peripheral arterial disease among substance abusers in drug treatment. Examine the occurrence of and risk factors for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in a sample in drug treatment.Cross-sectional/stratified design.Ten methadone treatment centers in a large Midwestern metropolitan area in the United States.Six hundred forty participants (290 men [45.3%] mean [SD] age, 46.54 years [8.85 years]) were included in the study. Sixty-one percent were African American, and 93.5% had a history of smoking cigarettes.PAD was defined as an ankle brachial index of less than 0.90 in at least 1 leg. Measures included demographic, health, and illicit drug use history questionnaires the Walking Impairment QuestionnairePAD was identified in 16.7% of the sample the mean ankle brachial index value for persons with PAD was 0.84 (SD, 0.05). Multiple logistic regression analysis found that sex (women) (odds ratio [OR], 2.10), history of ever smoking cigarettes (OR, 5.16), years of smoking cigarettes (OR, 1.60 per 10 years' smoking), and having a positive attitude toward physical activities/exertion (OR, 0.63) made significant contributions to the predictors for PAD after controlling other background and risk variables.PAD is prevalent in persons undergoing drug treatment and is best accounted for by cigarette smoking, sex differences, and physical inactivity. PAD in drug abusers should be evaluated, and the current findings merit further investigation.
