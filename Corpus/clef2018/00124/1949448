Multiphasic diagnostic evaluation of arteriogenic, venogenic, and sinusoidogenic impotency. Value of noninvasive tests compared with penile duplex ultrasonography. Fifty patients with a mean age of fifty-five years (range 25 to 75 years) in whom vasculogenic impotency was suspected clinically were evaluated to determine the type of vascular lesion involved: arterial insufficiency, venous leak, or sinusoidal dysfunction. All patients underwent first, noninvasive diagnostic tests including penile brachial index, penile brachial subtraction index, and penile plethysmogram, followed by penile duplex ultrasonography with papaverine and phentolamine injection. Patients with abnormal ultrasonography were divided into two groups: One group with suspected sinusoidal dysfunction and those with either arteriogenic or venogenic insufficiency but not considered candidates for surgery they were not subjected to further studies. Another group with suspected proximal arteriogenic lesions and those with suspected venous leakage considered candidates for surgical correction were subjected to angiography and cavernosometry-cavernosography, respectively. The findings of the noninvasive tests were compared with those provided by the invasive tests. The results indicated that noninvasive tests can predict whether or not impotency is arteriogenic in approximately 90 percent of cases. The noninvasive tests, however, were less accurate in predicting venogenic and sinusoidogenic impotency, for which penile duplex ultrasonography seems to be the choice.
