Obesity in schoolchildren from Merida, Venezuela: association with cardiovascular risk factors. To investigate the prevalence of obesity and associated cardiovascular risk factors in schoolchildren in our city, given the influence of these factors on the development of atherosclerosis.We studied a representative sample of second grade students composed of 370 children aged 7.82+/-0.62 years (47.8% girls and 52.2% boys) 52.4% were from public schools and 47.6% were from private schools. Surveys were performed and anthropometric measurements, blood pressure (BP) values and glucose and lipid profiles in capillary blood were determined.A total of 9.7% (36 schoolchildren) were obese and 13.8% were overweight. There were no differences according to sex or school system. Abdominal obesity was observed in 69.4% (p<0.0001), normal-high BP (90-97th percentile) in 27.8% (p<0.0001), dyslipidemia in 66.7% (p<0.05) and metabolic syndrome in 38.9% (p<0.0001) of the obese children compared with 1.3%, 5.1%, 48.9% and 0.4% of the children with normal weight, respectively. No association was found between fasting hyperglycemia and obesity. There were no cases of hypertension or diabetes mellitus. The risk (odds ratio) for normal-high BP, dyslipidemia, abdominal obesity and metabolic syndrome was 6.3, 2.2, 60.9, and 70.2 times higher in obese children than in non-obese children, respectively. A positive and significant correlation was found between waist circumference and body mass index with BP and the atherogenic indexes triglycerides/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), total cholesterol/HDL-C and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol/HDL-C (p=0.0001).Compared with cities in other countries, the city of MÃ©rida, Venezuela, has an intermediate prevalence of overweight and obesity in schoolchildren. The high frequency of cardiovascular risk factors in the obese and its positive correlation with adiposity highlights the need to implement population-based strategies for its prevention in childhood.
