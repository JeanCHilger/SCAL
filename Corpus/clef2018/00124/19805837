Concurrent assessment of epicardial coronary artery stenosis and microvascular dysfunction using diagnostic endpoints derived from fundamental fluid dynamics principles. Simultaneously measured pressure and flow distal to coronary stenoses can be combined, in conjunction with anatomical measurements, to assess the status of both the epicardial and microvascular circulations.Assessments of coronary hemodynamics were performed using fundamental fluid dynamics principles. We hypothesized that the pressure-drop coefficient (CDPe trans-stenotic pressure drop divided by the dynamic pressure in the distal vessel) correlates linearly with epicardial and microcirculatory resistances concurrently. In 14 pigs, simultaneous measurements of distal coronary arterial pressure and flow were performed using a dual sensor-tipped guidewire in the setting of both normal and disrupted microcirculation, with the presence of epicardial coronary lesions of ltThe CDPe can be readily obtained during routine pressure and flow measurements during cardiac catheterization. It is a promising clinical diagnostic parameter that can independently assess the severity of epicardial stenosis and microvascular impairment.
