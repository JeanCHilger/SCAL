Blood pressure in children and target-organ damage later in life. The aim of this study was to examine the association between blood pressure (BP) in children and adolescents and cardiovascular and renal disease in adulthood. This was a retrospective study on patients <18 years of age with an elective admission to Landspitali University Hospital in Reykjavik, Iceland, between 1950 and 1967. We recorded baseline variables including BP and invited all patients for a follow-up visit in 2008 for repeat studies. We used chi(2), Fisher's exact test, and logistic regression to examine the association between BP in childhood and outcome variables at follow-up. We identified 126 individuals (54 men) for the study. The median age (range) at childhood admission was 15 (10-17) years and the median BP was 125/80 mmHg. Median age at follow-up was 58 (42-68) years, follow-up time 43 (25-52) years, and median BP 133/75 mmHg. Eleven had died (five men) and 49 had been diagnosed with hypertension (23 men) and 12 with coronary artery disease (ten men). There was a significant correlation between the diagnosis of coronary artery disease at follow-up and childhood systolic BP (odds ratio = 1.052 P = 0.03) as well as systolic BP >/= 95th percentile (P = 0.03). Our results suggest that elevated childhood systolic BP may increase the risk of coronary artery disease in adult life. The sample size is a limiting factor, and the study should be carried out in a larger population.
