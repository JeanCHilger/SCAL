Stent placement in the superficial femoral artery for patients on chronic hemodialysis with peripheral artery disease. Chronic hemodialysis is associated with a high prevalence of peripheral artery disease (PAD), and patients on chronic hemodialysis with PAD have an increased risk of critical limb ischemia. The present study assessed the hemodynamic and clinical outcomes of stent placement in the superficial femoral artery (SFA) for patients on chronic hemodialysis.Between February 2005 to August 2008, 43 consecutive lower limbs in 42 patients with SFA lesions that were successfully treated by primary stent placement were included in this study. Those were divided into a dialysis group (18 limbs) and a nondialysis group (25 limbs). Outcome measures included primary patency, assisted primary patency, limb salvage, and survival.Patients were significantly younger and presented with significantly more symptomatic limb ischemia in the dialysis group compared to the nondialysis group, despite comparable TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) classification scores of SFA lesions between the two groups. The primary patency, primary assisted patency, limb salvage, and survival rates of the dialysis group were similar to those of the nondialysis group.Stent placement in the SFA is a feasible, safe, and effective procedure in patients on chronic hemodialysis with PAD, and may be offered as a first-choice therapeutic option for these patients.
