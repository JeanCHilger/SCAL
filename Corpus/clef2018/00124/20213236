Impact of metabolic indices on central artery stiffness: independent association of insulin resistance and glucose with aortic pulse wave velocity. Non-invasive measures of aortic stiffness reflect vascular senescence and predict outcome in diabetes. Glucose-mediated elastic artery sclerosis may play an integral role in the development of macrovascular complications. We used carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity ((cf)PWV) to quantify independent associations of fasting glucose, post-challenge glucose and derived insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) with aortic stiffness.(cf)PWV was measured using a 4 MHz continuous wave Doppler ultrasound probe within groups with newly identified age- and sex-matched normal glucose metabolism (NGM), impaired glucose regulation (IGR) and diabetes mellitus populations (n = 570, mean age 59.1, 56% male).After multivariate adjustment, IGR and diabetes were associated with significant aortic stiffening compared with NGM (adjusted (cf)PWV+/-SE: NGM, 9.15 +/- 0.12 m/s IGR 9.76 +/- 0.11 m/s, p < 0.001IGR characterised by fasting or post-challenge hyperglycaemia is associated with significant vascular stiffening. Post-challenge glucose and HOMA-IR are the most powerful metabolic predictors of arterial stiffness, implying hyperglycaemic excursion and insulin resistance play important roles in the pathogenesis of arteriosclerosis.
