Unrecognized secondary causes of hypertension in patients with hypertensive urgency/emergency: prevalence and co-prevalence. Hypertensive urgency/emergency occurs frequently, yet no prospective data on common secondary causes, including sleep apnea (SA), renal artery stenosis (RAS), and hyperaldosteronism, are available.Patients presenting to the emergency room for over 1 year with systolic blood pressure > or =180 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure > or =100 mmHg and typical symptoms were included. RAS was diagnosed by direct duplex/Doppler ultrasound of the renal artery, resistance index, and imaging. The aldosterone/renin ratio (ARR) was determined from morning blood samples taken with the patients supine after > or =2 h of rest. A positive ARR (>50) was followed by saline infusion to exclude primary hyperaldosteronism. SA was evaluated by nasal breathing flow screening when positive [apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) >5/h], complete polysomnography was performed.Of 161 patients (age, 66.0 +/- 13.1 years BMI, 28.6 +/- 5.1 kg), 131 had previously identified hypertension (duration, 12.7 +/- 11.5 yearsSecondary causes of hypertension are common and predominantly unrecognized in patients with hypertensive urgency/emergency. Co-prevalence of secondary causes occurs in about 15% and should be considered before therapeutic intervention.
