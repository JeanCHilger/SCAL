High prevalence of peripheral arterial disease in patients with previous cerebrovascular or coronary event. The presence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in patients with other manifestations of cardiovascular disease identifies a population at increased risk of complications both during acute coronary events and on a long-term basis and possibly a population in whom secondary prevention of cardiovascular events should be addressed aggressively. The present study was aimed at providing a valid estimate on the prevalence of PAD in patients attending their general practitioner and having previously suffered a cardio- or cerebrovascular event.1000 patients with a previous cardiovascular event were screened and PAD was considered present when the ankle-brachial index (ABI) of systolic blood pressure was less than 0.90 using the current recommended technique.965 (659 men) patients met the inclusion criteria and had detectable systolic blood pressures on the arms and ankles. Mean age was 70±8 years, 77% were current or previous smokers, and 188 patients were diabetics. The medical history included stroke in 392, transitory ischemic attacks in 77, acute coronary syndrome in 298, and ST-elevation myocardial infarction in 253. Brachial systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 139±18 mmHg and 79±12 mmHg, respectively. Total and LDL-cholesterols were 4.5±1.0 mmol/l and 2.4±0.8 mmol/l, respectively. 625 patients were without PAD, 322 had mild to moderate PAD and 18 had severe PAD. The overall prevalence of PAD was 35.3%.In patients with previous coronary or cerebrovascular events, PAD occurs with a much higher prevalence than previously estimated. It is suggested that screening for PAD is justified and that it should be carried out in these patients in order to regulate the possible lifestyle and medical intervention.
