Serum E-selectin levels in Indian children and adolescents: relation to clinical and biochemical parameters. An adverse pattern of blood lipids and atherosclerosis begin in childhood. Unfortunately, data for children and adolescents, particularly those in the Indian population, are scarce. The present study aims to evaluate the levels of serum E-selectin in Indian children and adolescents and its correlation with anthropometric and biochemical parameters.The study groups included 338 school children and adolescents. There were 96 obese children, 97 overweight children and 42 children with congenital heart disease who were compared with 103 normal controls, aged 10-17 years. Serum E-selectin and serum leptin were analyzed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Lipid profile and fasting glucose were analyzed using an autoanalyzer.Serum E-selectin levels were significantly increased in obese (65.3 ± 8.39 ng/mL) and overweight (56.01 ± 6.96 ng/mL) subjects (P < 0.001). However, these levels were lower in children with congenital heart disease (40.99 ± 6.54 ng/mL) than in controls (43.79 ± 6.71 ng/mL).Serum E-selectin levels showed good positive association with body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, leptin, total cholesterol, triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and showed negative correlation with fasting glucose and no significant association with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. These findings indicate that higher E-selectin levels can induce endothelial activation and play an essential role in the earliest stage of the atherosclerotic process in obese and overweight children. Regular camps at schools to counsel the identified overweight and obese children and to encourage physical exercise would help to reduce the risk of these children being prone to major cardiovascular anomalies in adulthood.
