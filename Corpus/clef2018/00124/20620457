Risk factors for deterioration of renal function after donor nephrectomy. There are few recent studies investigating increased risks for adverse effects leading to chronic kidney disease (CKD) among kidney donors. The aim of this study was to identify factors that protect renal function among actual live kidney donors.We enrolled 68 individuals who had undergone donor nephrectomy in this study. We assessed donor age, body mass index (BMI), casual blood pressure, preoperative and 3-month follow-up serum creatinines, serum total cholesterol, and several other clinical parameters. The severity of arteriosclerosis in the arteriolar and interlobular arteries of the donor kidney was semiquantitatively evaluated in 4 grades using back table biopsies. Impairment of renal function after surgery was expressed by differences in serum creatinine levels.The ratio of glomerular sclerosis, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure positively correlated with donor age. Deterioration of renal function after donor nephrectomy negatively correlated with BMI and positively correlated with severity of arteriosclerosis in interlobular arteries. A multiple regression analysis model with respect to the severity of arteriosclerosis in interlobular arteries showed significant influence, of serum creatinine and systolic blood pressure.Preventing progression of arteriosclerosis and selecting the optimal BMI before donor nephrectomy will help to avoid impaired renal function among live kidney donors.
