Inflow atherosclerotic disease localized to the common femoral artery: treatment and outcome. Severe occlusive disease of the common femoral artery without significant aortoiliac disease is not common in our experience. Since 1978 we have operated upon 29 limbs in 22 patients (mean age 60) with localized common femoral artery disease. Indications for operation were claudication in 31% and impending limb loss in 69%. Operations included common femoral artery endarterectomy with patch angioplasty (19 limbs), patch angioplasty alone (two limbs), and common femoral artery endarterectomy without a patch (three limbs). Operative mortality was zero there were nine wound complications, one patient had a myocardial infarction with early thrombosis. Symptomatic relief was obtained in 20 of 22 patients. All minor amputations healed. The mean postoperative ankle/brachial index increased to 0.67 from 0.49. Mean follow-up is 37 months (one-118 months)
