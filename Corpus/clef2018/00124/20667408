eGFR is associated with subclinical atherosclerosis independent of albuminuria: the Dong-gu Study. This study evaluated the relationships between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and carotid atherosclerosis, peripheral arterial disease (PAD), arterial stiffness, and left ventricular hypertrophy, independent of albuminuria.The study population consisted of 6694 people aged 50 years and older who participated in the baseline survey of the Dong-gu Study conducted in Korea between 2007 and 2009. The common carotid artery intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT), carotid plaque, ankle-brachial index (ABI), brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) of each subjects was assessed.After adjustment for risk factors and albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR), kidney dysfunction (eGFR=30-44 ml/min per 1.73 m2) was significantly associated with carotid plaque presence (odds ratio [OR], 1.75 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21-2.53) and PAD (OR, 2.64Independent of albuminuria, eGFR is associated with carotid plaque, PAD, baPWV, and LVMI but not with CCA-IMT in Koreans aged 50 years and older.
