Initial results of a 12-week, institution-based, supervised exercise rehabilitation program for the management of peripheral arterial disease. This study assessed the effectiveness of a 12-week, institution-based, supervised exercise rehabilitation program with atherogenic risk factor modification in improving cardiovascular profile, ambulatory function, and quality of life of patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) by comparing pre- and postprogram measurements. Participants were prospectively enrolled. Cardiovascular profile variables, ambulatory function tests, and quality of life questionnaires were evaluated. Of 101 institution-based program participants, 69 completed the 12-session minimum and 47 completed a postprogram evaluation. Mean postprogram results were significantly different from preprogram results, corresponding to improvement, for the following variables: triglyceride levels (p  =  .036), both function tests (p < .001 for both), four of five Walking Impairment Questionnaire measurements, and Intermittent Claudication Questionnaire score (p  = .001). This supervised exercise program improved the cardiovascular profiles, ambulatory function, and quality of life of PAD patients completing the program and is a viable adjunct to drug therapy and surgical intervention.
