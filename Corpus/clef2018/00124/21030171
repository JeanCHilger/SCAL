Triggered non-contrast enhanced MR angiography of peripheral arteries: optimization of systolic and diastolic time delays for electrocardiographic triggering. The purpose of this study was to determine the optimal systolic and diastolic time delays for electrocardiographic triggering of a non-contrast media enhanced MR angiography using a 3-dimensional fast spin echo sequence in patients suffering from peripheral arterial disease. 12 patients with suspected peripheral arterial disease were examined on a 1.5 T Philips Achieva MR scanner. A cardiac-triggered Volumetric Isotropic T2-weighted fast spin echo sequence was performed using variable trigger delays for systolic and diastolic phase. The signal in the popliteal arteries and anterior tibial arteries of the systolic and diastolic images was measured and optimal delay times for systolic and diastolic phase were determined. Minimum signal to noise ratio (SNR) appears at the time difference ΔT=-21 ms on systolic images of the popliteal arteries. In the anterior tibial arteries the minimum SNR is significantly higher and appears at the time difference ΔT=-14 ms. Diastolic delay times must be chosen as long or as short as possible depending on heart rate. In peripheral vessels triggered non-contrast MR angiography can yield results which are comparable with contrast enhanced MRA techniques. It is crucial to optimize timing parameters.
