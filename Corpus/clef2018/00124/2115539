Large coronary arteries in humans are responsive to changing blood flow: an endothelium-dependent mechanism that fails in patients with atherosclerosis. Changes in blood flow can alter vasomotion of conduit arteries. This study examined vasomotor responses to incremental blood flow induced by papaverine in the epicardial arteries of 10 patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries (group 1) and in 14 patients with arterial irregularities (group 2) using quantitative angiography and Doppler ultrasound flow velocity measurements. An increase in coronary blood flow of 384.3 +/- 32.8% (p less than 0.001) in group 1 patients was associated with dilation of the proximal coronary artery segment and a 23.2 +/- 4.6% increase in cross-sectional area (p less than 0.001). In contrast, in group 2 patients a similar increase in coronary blood flow of 339.3 +/- 18.7% (p less than 0.001) was associated with mixed responses and a modest net constriction in cross-sectional area of -7.4 +/- 2.8% (p less than 0.05). The dilation response to nitroglycerin was intact in group 1 (31.7 +/- 4.2%, p less than 0.001) and in group 2 (26.4 +/- 3.2%, p less than 0.001). In five patients from group 1 acetylcholine, an endothelium-dependent dilator, produced an increase in cross-sectional area of 20.7 +/- 4.6% (p less than 0.05) that paralleled the response to an increase in flow in the same segment (a 24.3 +/- 6.1% increase in cross-sectional area, p less than 0.05). Five group 2 patients demonstrated a vasoconstrictor response to acetylcholine (a -22.8 +/- 3.4% decrease in cross-sectional area, p less than 0.05) together with an impaired dilation response to incremental flow (a -6.4 +/- 3.2% decrease in cross-sectional area).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
