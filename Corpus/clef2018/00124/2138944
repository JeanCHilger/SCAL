Subclavian stenosis presenting as progressive exertional angina pectoris. Left subclavian stenosis is an uncommon cause of exertional left arm pain. In a patient who presented with exertional chest and left arm pain in an increasing pattern, clinical evaluation disclosed a discrepancy between right and left arm blood pressure. Exercise stress testing with thallium revealed normal myocardial perfusion. Aortic arch and selective angiography revealed a high-grade proximal left subclavian stenosis. Subclavian angioplasty was performed with complete resolution of symptoms. This case demonstrates that ischemic left arm pain due to subclavian stenosis can present as accelerated angina, and highlights the importance of determining blood pressure in both arms in routine evaluation of patients at risk for atherosclerosis.
