Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the infrarenal abdominal aorta. The results of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) (n = 13) of the lower abdominal aorta are reported in 12 patients. The mean patient age was relatively low (46 years). In 7 cases there were isolated aortic obstructions (6 stenoses, 1 occlusion). In the remaining 6 aortic stenoses, there were also major atherosclerotic lesions distally. The mean diameter of the aortic section in which PTA was performed, measured 8.2 mm. The total diameter of the PTA balloon(s) averaged 19.1 mm. The arterial gradient dropped significantly from 41.4 mm Hg (mean) to 2 mm Hg after PTA. The arm-ankle index increased significantly from 0.64 to 0.97. The follow-up included 9 patients 1 showed restenosis 38 month after PTA. There were no clinically relevant complications. The data published on abdominal PTA in atherosclerotic lesions are summarized.
