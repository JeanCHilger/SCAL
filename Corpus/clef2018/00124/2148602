Evaluation of the microcirculation in a sheep island pedicle flap with laser Doppler flowmeter and 99m-Tc-labelled red blood cells. The aim of the study was experimentally to evaluate the capability and reliability of laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) in conditions of circulatory deficiency, by correlating it to flow-related parameters measured by a radionuclide-imaging technique and using 99m-Tc red blood cells (RBCs). For this purpose, a pedicle island flap in the sheep was used, with well-perfused proximal parts and with evident stasis in the distal third of the flap. No correlation was found between results obtained with the two techniques. In regions with evident stasis, falsely high LDF readings were recorded. This may be due to a back-and-forth motion of the RBCs under the probe, rather than to true flow. It was concluded that, while LDF seems reliable in detecting complete arterial occlusion, it is unreliable in predicting either complete venous occlusion or partial obstruction of the flow to and from the flap. Clinical use for this purpose cannot be recommended.
