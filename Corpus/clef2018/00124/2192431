New developments in noninvasive diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs. Since the clinical diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower limbs is nonspecific, a confirmation by objective tests is mandatory. Recently, three new simple and reproducible methods of detecting DVT have been developed: computerized impedance plethysmography, standardized Doppler ultrasound, and compression ultrasonography. In three large prospective studies including consecutive outpatients with clinically suspected DVT, these tests were blindly evaluated versus phlebography, to determine diagnostic criteria and accuracy. The sensitivity for proximal DVT was 91% for computerized impedance plethysmography, 91% for standardized Doppler ultrasound and 100% for compression ultrasonography sensitivity for all thrombi (including calf-vein thrombi) was 86, 85 and 91%, respectively
