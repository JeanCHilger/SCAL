The effect of enalapril on leg muscle blood flow in patients with claudication. In the percent study the authors have demonstrated that the peripheral blood flow and resistance as measured by strain-gauge venous occlusion plethysmography were favourably altered by enalapril. The peripheral blood flow increased significantly and since there was no detectable change in ankle pressure this indicated a decrease in resistance during administration of the drug.
