Ulnar artery occlusion is predictive of digital ulcers in SSc: a duplex sonography study. To assess the prevalence and risk factors of ulnar artery occlusion (UAO) in an unselected SSc patient cohort and to determine whether UAO is associated with digital ulcers (DUs).A total of 79 SSc patients and 40 'healthy' controls underwent colour duplex sonography of the radial and ulnar artery to compare blood flow velocity, resistive indices (RIs) and presence of occlusion and were followed for a mean of 53 months.In both, radial and ulnar arteries, peak systolic velocity (PSV) and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) were significantly lower and RI higher in SSc patients compared with controls (PSVrad: 40.1 vs 48.6 cm/s PSVuln 38.2 vs 56.6 cm/sBlood flow is significantly decreased in radial and ulnar arteries in SSc. UAO is frequent and an important risk factor for the development of DUs in patients with SSc.
