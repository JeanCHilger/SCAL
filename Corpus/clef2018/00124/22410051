Hemodynamics of portal venous stenosis before and after treatment in pediatric liver transplantation: evaluation with Doppler ultrasound. The aim of this study was to evaluate portal vein stenosis (PVS) in pediatric liver transplantation (PLT) using Doppler ultrasound (DUS) before and after interventional management for hemodynamic changes.From 2000 to 2010, we encountered 11 PVS cases among 180 PLT that were evaluated using DUS and computed tomography (CT) angiography (CTA) all underwent portal stenting. DUS was used to monitor portal hemodynamics. For the diagnosis of PVS, we investigated multiple parameters including stenotic size (SS), stenotic ratio (SR) (SR [%]=PRE-SS/PRE [PRE=stenotic size]), portal flow velocity ratio (VR) (VR=VS/PRE [PRE=velocity at prestenotic siteThe incidence of PVS was 5.6% (11/180). The PV was 2.5 mm using DUS and 2.7 mm using CTA. The average SR was 65% fitting the criterion. Low prestenotic portal flow<12 cm/sec and high peak velocity in the stenotic segment (up to 147 cm/sec) were observed in 6 cases. The VR value was high at 7.5:1 and there was splenomegaly with thrombocytopenia. After portal vein stenting, hyperperfusion occurred might after reopening the stenosis: the flow increased to an average of 34 cm/sec and then flow decreased slowly to a stable level 2 weeks later. The size of the spleen decreased from 17 to 12 cm and the thrombocytopenia also improved with platelet counts increasing from 67×10(3) to 178×10(3)/μl at 2 months follow-up. The changes in portal flow, portal vein size, spleen size, and platelet count were significant (P<.05).PVS is diagnosed using DUS by increased intrahepatic PV dilatation, peak flow at the stenotic site, discrepant VR. Early portal stenting showed a better prognosis. DUS is essential and effective for hemodynamic monitoring and management of PVS.
