Distal venous arterialization and reperfusion injury: focus on oxidative status. In patients with unreconstructable arterial occlusive disease distal venous arterialization (DVA) seems to be a promising option in the treatment. The goals of this prospective study were to assess clinical efficiency and possible impact of DVA on tissue damage by estimating oxidative status of patients with critical limb ischemia treated with this procedure. The subjects were 60 randomized patients: 30 were undergoing DVA and 30 were treated with antiaggregation therapy. During the mean follow-up period (6.13 ± 4.32 months for DVA vs. 6.74 ± 0.5 months for antiaggregation therapy) survival (p < 0.01), limb salvage (p < 0.001), pain relief (p < 0.001) and wound healing (p < 0.001) rates were significantly different between the two groups of patients in favor of the DVA group. Ten minutes after declamping we observed a decreasing trend in the lactate level in the blood of the deep venous system (p < 0.001). Also, on postoperative day 7 digital systolic pressure and digital-brachial index were higher than before the operation (p < 0.001). In blood samples collected immediately before and successively at 1, 3, 5 and 10 min postoperatively, prooxidative status (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, O(2)(-), H(2)O(2) and nitric oxide) and antioxidative enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione reductase) were determined spectrophotometrically. Using the nonparametric Friedman test, we noted statistically nonsignificant differences (p > 0.05) in values of both prooxidative parameters and enzymes of the antioxidative defense system, before and successively at 1, 3, 5 and 10 min after operation. These results indicate that there was no statistically significant reperfusion injury after revascularization, which could have been expected after this surgical procedure, thus confirming its validity in these patients.
