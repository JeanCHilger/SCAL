Clinical correlates of size and number of collateral vessels in peripheral artery disease. We studied associations of the number and size of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)-assessed lower extremity collateral vessels with the ankle-brachial index (ABI), severity of superficial femoral artery (SFA) plaque, and leg symptoms in participants with peripheral artery disease (PAD).
