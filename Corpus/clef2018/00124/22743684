High prevalence of peripheral arterial disease in hypertensive patients:  the Evaluation of Ankle-Brachial Index in Hungarian Hypertensives screening program. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) can be diagnosed in asymptomatic stage, measuring ankle-brachial index (ABI). Low ABI is an indicator of increased cardiovascular risk and its inclusion to traditional risk factors can improve risk prediction. The objective of the present cross-sectional part of our large-scale, multicenter, observational study was to evaluate the prevalence of PAD in a large cohort of hypertensive patients.A total of 21 892 hypertensive men and women (9162 men mean age 61.45 years) were included in our prospective study in hypertension clinics. Clinical history, physical examination, and blood analysis were taken, and the ABI was measured with the Doppler method in all patients. The prevalence of PAD (ABI â‰¤ 0.9) was 14.4%. In 15.6% of the patients an ABI of 0.91-0.99, and in 9.4% of the patients high ABI (>1.3) was measured. In the low, moderate, high, and very high Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation risk groups, the prevalence of low ABI was 8.1, 11.1, 16.3, and 26%, respectively. The prevalence of PAD was lower in hypertensive patients achieving their blood pressure target (9.6 vs. 16.8%Asymptomatic PAD was highly prevalent in the studied hypertensive population. The use of ABI screening may improve cardiovascular risk prediction. Optimal blood pressure goal values in PAD patients and cardiovascular morbidity/mortality data will be evaluated after the 5-year long prospective phase of the Evaluation of Ankle-Brachial Index in Hungarian Hypertensives program.
