Prevalence of multifocal atherosclerosis in different age  groups. Aim of the study was to assess prevalence of lesions in several arterial beds in patients with atherosclerosis of various localization in the clinic of cardiovascular surgery. We examined 1018 patients (825 men and 193 women, aged 31-78 years, mean age 59+/-12 years) in the period of preparation to elective surgical interventions on coronary arteries or other arterial beds. All patients were divided into 4 age groups: group 1 - younger than 60 years (n=542), group 2  -  60-64 years (n=215), group 3  -  65-69 years (n=141), group 4-70 years and older (n=120). All patients were subjected to coronary angiography and Doppler ultrasound investigation (USI) of extracranial arteries. USI of arteries of lower extremities and angiography of peripheral arteries were carried out if indicated. Presence of 50% or greater stenosis was considered a criterion of involvement of an arterial vascular bed. Lesions in 2 or more beds were found in 321 patients (31.5%). Stenoses in 2 and 3 arterial beds were revealed in 24 and 3.5%, respectively, of patients in group 1, and in 31.8 and 10%, respectively, of patients in group 4 (p=0.008). Purposeful diagnostics of multifocal atherosclerosis in patients of the given category apparently should not be limited by older age groups.
