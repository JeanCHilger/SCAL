Endovascular brachytherapy using liquid Beta-emitting rhenium-188 for the treatment of long-segment femoropopliteal in-stent stenosis. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of endovascular brachytherapy with liquid beta-emitting rhenium-188 (Re-188) in patients with long-segment in-stent stenosis in the femoropopliteal segment.From July 2009 to April 2011, 90 consecutive patients (59 men mean age 68.3Â±10.3 years, range 43-86) with symptomatic in-stent stenosis/occlusion (24.6-cm mean lesion length) of the femoropopliteal segment underwent angioplasty and subsequent endovascular brachytherapy. The liquid beta-emitting Re-188 was applied to the target lesion within an angioplasty balloon using a dose of 13 Gy at a depth of 2 mm into the vessel wall. Clinical and angiographic follow-up data were collected up to 2 years. The main study endpoints were the 6- and 12-month primary patency rates defined as <50% in-stent stenosis as detected by duplex ultrasound. Clinical endpoints were the cumulative rates of death, amputation, and bypass surgery, as well as improvement in the Rutherford category and the ankle-brachial index. Results were correlated with patient and lesion characteristics.Primary technical success was achieved in all patients, with 1 early stent thrombosis, but no other complications related to the irradiation. Eighty-eight patients reached the 6-month and 82 the 12-month examinations the primary patency was 95.2% and 79.8%, respectively. In-stent stenosis occurred in 9 patients, while 10 patients had reocclusion of the treated segment. During follow-up, there were 2 late acute thrombotic occlusions, both after discontinuation of clopidogrel. The clinical status improved in 67.0% and 62.2% of the patients after 6 and 12 months, respectively. No patient, lesion, or procedure variables were predictive of restenosis after EVBT.EVBT with liquid beta-emitting Re-188 was safe and effective in preventing restenosis in long-segment femoropopliteal ISS.
