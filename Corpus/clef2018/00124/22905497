Doubly localized surface plasmon resonance in bimodally distributed silver nanoparticles. Growth of bimodally distributed silver nanoparticles using sequential physical vapour deposition (PVD) is reported. Growth conditions of nanoparticles are defined in the following three steps: In the first step, nanoparticles are grown at a heated substrate and then exposed to atmosphere, in the second step, nanoparticles are vacuum annealed and finally re-deposition of silver is performed in the third step. This special way of deposition leads to the formation of bimodally distributed nanoparticles. It has been investigated that by changing the deposition time, different sets of bimodally distributed nanoparticles can be grown. Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of such bimodally distributed nanoparticles generates double plasmon resonance peaks with overlapped absorption spectra. Double plasmon resonance peaks provide a quick indication of the existence of two sets of nanoparticles. LSPR spectra of such bimodally distributed nanoparticles could be modeled with double Lorentz oscillator model. Inclusion of double Lorentz oscillator model indicates that there exist two sets of non-interacting nanoparticles resonating at different plasma frequencies. It is also reported that silver nanoparticles grown at a heated substrate, again attain the new shape while being exposed to atmosphere, followed by vacuum annealing at the same temperature. This is because of physisorption of oxygen at the silver surface and change in surface free energy. The re-shaping due to the adsorbed oxygen on the surface is responsible for bimodal size distribution of nanoparticles.
