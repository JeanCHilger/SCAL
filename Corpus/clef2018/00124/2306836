Paradoxical narrowing of atherosclerotic coronary arteries induced by increases in heart rate. Vasodilation in normal and vasoconstriction in atherosclerotic coronary arteries have been observed in response to complex stimuli such as exercise and the cold pressor test. To study a single parameter that changes during these activities, and to better understand the pathophysiology of ischemia associated with increases in heart rate, we studied coronary vasomotion and blood flow response to increasing heart rate alone, produced by atrial pacing, with quantitative angiographic and Doppler flow-velocity measurements in 15 patients. In five patients with angiographically smooth coronary arteries (group 1), tachycardia produced progressive dilation of the epicardial artery with increases in cross-sectional area (CSA) of +15.5 +/- 3.4%, +22.4 +/- 2.1%, +28.5 +/- 3.3%, and +30.6 +/- 2.2% at 90, 110, 130, and 150 beats/min, respectively. In contrast, in five patients with mild angiographic narrowings (group 2), coronary segments failed to dilate with progressive tachycardia (-6.3 +/- 2.0%, -8.3 +/- 2.0%, -12.5 +/- 2.0%, and -11.4% at 90, 110, 130, and 150 beats/min, respectively), and progressive loss of luminal area was observed in five patients with severe angiographic narrowings (group 3) (-34.4 +/- 3.4%, -49.6 +/- 2.2%, -59.2%, and -72.8% at 90, 110, 130, and 150 beats/min, respectively). Coronary blood flow increased significantly with tachycardia in group 1 (+44.5 +/- 10.2%, +86.0 +/- 24.6%, +105.8 +/- 29.3%, and +137.5 +/- 46.0%), increased slightly in group 2 (+7.8 +/- 3.2%, +9.4 +/- 4.4%, +8.4 +/- 3.9%, and +10.0%), and decreased significantly in group 3 (-31.8 +/- 6%, -42.6 +/- 10.7%, -61.0%, and -70.0%). We conclude that an isolated increase in heart rate in patients with normal coronary arteries results in a modest increase in flow and vasodilation. In early atherosclerosis, the flow increase is blunted and dilation is replaced with paradoxical loss in luminal size. In patients with stenoses, further loss in luminal size occurs accompanied by a decrease in coronary blood flow. Thus, increasing heart rate alone in the setting of coronary stenoses could produce myocardial ischemia by a reduction in coronary supply, as well as by an increase in oxygen demand.
