Percutaneous transluminal atherectomy of the femoropopliteal arteries. Technic, indications, results after 6 months. Percutaneous atherectomy was performed in 25 patients with 30 symptomatic femoro-popliteal stenoses. Twenty-three patients were successfully treated with resolution of claudication and a mean 0.35 increase in the ankle-arm-index. Two early thromboses occurred. Residual stenosis was less-than 30% in 25 lesions, with no dissection, and no embolization. Atherectomy seems to be an effective treatment for eccentric and calcified lesions. At 6 months follow-up (17 patients, 19 lesions) clinical and Doppler improvement remained stable in 14 patients 2 restenosis and 1 new disease occurred. Atherectomy restores a large lumen with minimal wall trauma, thereby possibly decreasing the restenosis rate.
