Role of models in understanding and interpreting clinical Doppler ultrasound. Mathematical and physical models are essential tools in both fundamental and clinically applied Doppler ultrasound research. In this paper we illustrate a variety of models and show how they can be used to understand and interpret clinical Doppler ultrasound signals, particularly from stenosed arteries. The physical models discussed include both steady and pulsatile flow systems, and also a flow visualization technique that can be used to interpret the Doppler signals at a fundamental hemodynamic level. The mathematical models deal with three different aspects of the Doppler signal: models that describe the mechanism of ultrasound scattering by blood, a model to stimulate the returned Doppler signal and a model that may be used to aid in the analysis of clinical recordings. Each of these models provides a more complete understanding of blood flow through normal and stenosed vessels and contributes to the interpretation of clinical Doppler signals.
