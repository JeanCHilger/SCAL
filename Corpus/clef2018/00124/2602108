Treatment with expandable metallic stent for arterial occlusive disease. Gianturco expandable metallic stents were used in 4 cases with ASO of the iliac artery after PTA for the purpose of the prevention of restenosis. The insertion of stent was succeeded in all 4 cases, and the improvement of clinical symptoms and elevation of ankle pressure index were observed. Follow-up over 3 to 8 months revealed no occlusion and migration of stent. Expandable metallic stent was suggested to be contributable to the treatment of arterial occlusive disease.
