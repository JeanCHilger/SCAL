The effect of hydroxyethylrutoside and its combination with acetylsalicylic acid in patients with obliterative atherosclerosis. The effect of 7-mono-hydroxyethylrutoside and its combination with acetylsalicylic acid was evaluated in a controlled clinical trial, performed in 105 patients with obliterative atherosclerosis of the lower limbs, and using non-invasive measurement of peripheral haemodynamic parameters--blood flow during reactive hyperaemia and ankle systolic blood pressure. Patients, randomized into three groups, received either placebo or 7-mono-hydroxyethylrutoside alone or in combination with acetylsalicylic acid for 12 months. The placebo group showed a decrease in maximum calf blood flow and a decrease in ankle systolic pressure. Administration of 7-mono-hydroxyethylrutoside did not lead to any significant changes in systolic pressure but there was a decrease in the maximum calf blood flow. There were no statistically significant changes in patients receiving the 7-mono-hydroxyethylrutoside and acetylsalicylic acid combination who, by contrast, showed a tendency to increased values of the parameters measured.
