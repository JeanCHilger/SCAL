Current applications of duplex and color Doppler ultrasound imaging: carotid and peripheral vascular system. Recent advances in ultrasound technology have made possible the development of diagnostic instruments that combine cross-sectional imaging and Doppler analysis. These instruments have expanded the role of diagnostic ultrasonography to the assessment of carotid and peripheral vascular disease. The current applications of duplex Doppler and color Doppler imaging in evaluating the extracranial carotid arteries, vertebral artery, peripheral venous system, and peripheral arterial system are reviewed. The indications for and limitations of these examinations, as well as the potential future uses, are discussed.
