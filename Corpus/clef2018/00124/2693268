Ultrasonographic diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis of the leg. 142 patients with the clinical diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the legs were examined by high resolution ultrasound. The deep and superficial femoral and popliteal veins were examined with 6.5 and 10 MHz transducers. 124 of the patients were also examined with continuous wave Doppler ultrasound and in 46 contrast phlebography was performed. The overall accuracy of ultrasound compared to phlebography was 90%. If only the deep femoral vein was considered, ultrasound and phlebography correlated in 100%. The ultrasonographic characteristics of DVT are increased echogenicity of the involved vein, absence of response to the Valsalva maneuver and non-collapsibility of the thrombosed vein on pressing with the transducer probe. High resolution ultrasonography should be the primary tool for the diagnosis of DVT.
