Doppler sphygmomanometry in the diagnosis of obliterating atherosclerosis. The diagnostic possibilities of regional systolic pressure measurement was appraised in examination of 76 patients with various localization of the occlusive lesion and stages of the disease. The indices of regional systolic pressure (IRSP) were compared for precise comparative analysis. The indices of changes of systolic pressure (ICP) between the measurement zones were calculated for comparison of pressure changes along the length of certain limb segments. The malleolar systolic pressure index is of highest diagnostic importance in identifying the occlusive lesion, whatever its type. IRSP changes at different levels give a precise idea of the hemodynamic conditions of each type of occlusive lesion. The ICP should be accepted as the criterion of the spread of the occlusive process in arteries below the inguinal ligament. The suggested method makes it possible not only to detect the occlusive process, but to differentiate an aorto-iliac and femoropopliteal blockade or their combination.
