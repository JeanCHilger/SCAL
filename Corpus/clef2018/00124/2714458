Can thyroxine halt the progression of peripheral arterial disease? Fifteen women with claudication and increased serum thyrotrophin (TSH) were treated with L-thyroxine (25-75 micrograms). These women were selected from a group of 80 consecutive women presenting with claudication, rest pain or gangrene. One year after their TSH was normal, their progress, serum lipids and lipoproteins were compared with the 58 women with normal levels of serum TSH the remainder were already receiving thyroxine. Non-invasive assessment showed that three of the 15 (20%) women treated with thyroxine had progression of arterial disease, two in the legs and one in the legs and coronary arteries
