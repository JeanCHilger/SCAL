Microvascular evaluation of the effects of nifedipine in vascular patients by laser-Doppler flowmetry. Skin blood flow in the microcirculation of the distal foot was evaluated in patients with vascular disease and diabetes and compared with that in normal volunteers by use of laser-Doppler flowmetry. Resting flow (RF) and the flow on standing (SF) were measured in a room at constant temperature (20-22 degrees C). RF was significantly different in the five groups, being increased in patients with diabetes (in comparison with normal volunteers) and decreased in patients with intermittent claudication, rest pain, and ischemic limbs. The venoarteriolar reflex (in response to standing) was also decreased or abolished in diabetic and in all vascular patients. After treatment of all vascular patients with nifedipine (10 mg tid) for one week, there was a significant increase in RF in all patients. The venoarteriolar reflex was improved but still remained below the normal limit. In conclusion laser-Doppler flowmetry is useful both for differentiating classes of different vascular patients and for evaluating the microcirculatory changes induced by nifedepine.
