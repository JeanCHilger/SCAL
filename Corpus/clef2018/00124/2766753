Peripheral circulation in hypertensive and normotensive acromegalics. Clinical examination and blood pressure measurement over the ankle in 31 patients with acromegaly, showing signs of active disease, did not reveal manifestations of obliterative arterial disease in the lower limbs. Sixteen of the patients had a normal blood pressure in none of them did the authors find a deviation of blood flow in the foot and in the calf at rest and during reactive hyperaemia following 5-minute ischaemia. Fifteen patients with hypertension were found to have increased resting blood flow in the foot and calf and increased blood flow in the foot during reactive hyperaemia.
