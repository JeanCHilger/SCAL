Clinical relevance of pedal pulse palpation in patients suspected of peripheral arterial insufficiency. Previous studies in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) have shown that the prognosis is relatively good when the distal systolic ankle index (ankle systolic pressure/arm systolic pressure) is above 50% and the distal toe systolic pressure is above 40 mmHg. In 132 patients suspected of PAD in the legs we investigated the relationship between the presence of pedal pulse and the distal systolic pressure in order to discover what diagnostic and prognostic information could be found from pulse palpation alone. The prospective study consisted of three consecutive series (A, 51 patients B, 42 patients
