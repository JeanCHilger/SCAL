The association of lower extremity peripheral vascular disease in patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery. The association of lower extremity peripheral vascular disease (PVD) in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass (CAB) has been studied in two groups of patients who have been operated upon between January and May 1987. Group 1 consists of 125 cases in which only resting ankle-arm pressure index (AAPI) were evaluated. Group 2 consists of 50 cases where both resting and after exercise AAPI were recorded. In total, 17 cases of one extremity and in 10 both lower extremity resting AAPI were below 0.9 (15.4%). In Group 2 comparison of resting and after exercise AAPI on both sides showed no statistically significant difference. However in Group 2, 13 cases (26%) had after exercise AAPI below 0.9 and in 26 (52%) cases after exercise AAPI were lower than the resting AAPI. This study showed that, although the coexistence of PVD in patients undergoing CAB is not as high as the coexistence of CAD in patients undergoing peripheral vascular procedures, this percentage can increase when the presence of PVD is evaluated with an exercise test whenever possible.
