Effectiveness of angiologic study methods in stage-1 arterial occlusive disease. 277 patients at stage I after Fontaine were examined for the control of the capacity for clinical and noninvasive apparative investigation methods for the early diagnostics of the arterial occlusive disease. Taking into consideration the angiographic reference method, calculations of sensitivity, specifity and efficiency as well as multivariate statistical evaluation were carried out for the individual techniques. Haemodynamically relevant obstructions of the vascular system could most certainly be established by means of ultrasound-Doppler-pressure measurements (sensitivity = 96%). Also the bicycleergometry and the oscillography under stress were suitable for the early diagnostics. The results of the angiological functional examination underlie the indication for further diagnostics and control of therapy.
