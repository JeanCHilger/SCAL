Comparative studies of the effect of a cardioselective and a noncardioselective beta-blocker on peripheral circulation in patients with arterial occlusive disease. The effect of celiprolol at a daily dosage of 300 mg (19 patients) was compared with that of propranolol at a daily dosage of 120 mg (14 patients) on peripheral blood flow of the calf and foot in a randomized double-blind trial. Altogether 33 patients (47 extremities) suffering from arterial occlusive disease (stage II according to Fontaine) and hypertension, were treated for 25 days. Blood flow was measured by strain-gauge plethysmography. Celiprolol led to a small, insignificant increase in resting blood flow of the muscle. Propranolol produced a small decrease in resting blood flow of the muscle, and a significant fall in resting blood flow of the skin of the foot. At the completion of treatment with celiprolol there was a small increase in the initial value of reactive hyperaemia of the calf. Propranolol led to a decrease in the initial, and in the maximum values of reactive hyperaemia of the calf and foot. Celiprolol and propranolol led to a comparable decrease in resting blood pressure.
