Hemodynamic effect of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for lower limb atherosclerosis. A study based on pulsed Doppler ultrasound flowmetry. Measurements of ankle pressure index (API) and arterial flow velocity including calculation of pulsatility index (PI) from the common femoral and pedal arteries were performed in 89 limbs of 75 patients before and after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) (63 iliac and 26 femoropopliteal). A pulsed wave Doppler ultrasound flowmeter was used. An increase of API at rest of at least 0.15 or the absence of pressure drop after exercise following PTA was used as criteria for a hemodynamically successful angioplasty. In patients with hemodynamically successful PTA of an iliac obstruction PI increased from 4.2 to 8.6 (p less than 0.001) 91 per cent of these patients improved clinically. When iliac angioplasty was hemodynamically unsuccessful, PI remained unchanged
