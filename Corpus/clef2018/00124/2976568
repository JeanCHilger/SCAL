Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of iliac and femoral arteries in severe lower-limb ischaemia. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was performed 92 times in 86 patients with severe lower-limb ischaemia (40% occlusion), giving rise to rest pain and/or gangrene. The patients were thereafter observed for periods up to 5 years. Criteria for success were appearance of normal groin pulse (iliac angioplasty) or persistent greater than or equal to 0.15 rise in arm/ankle blood pressure index (femoropopliteal angioplasty). The respective technical success rates were 82% and 64%. The complication rate was 10.9%, including 5.4% distal embolization. Patency rates were higher in iliac than in femoropopliteal lesions, in stenotic than occluded vessels, and also when the lesion was shorter than 5 cm and if there was good run-off. Limb salvage exceeded patency by 10% in the iliac procedures and by 15% in the femoropopliteal. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty is recommended for selected cases of severe lower-limb ischaemia, and should always be considered for limb salvage. Reocclusion does not necessarily imply clinical failure. Technical failures should be included in calculated patency rates in order to document the method's limitations.
