Ultrasonics and directional Doppler. Study of superficial phlebitis of the lower extremities. The objective of the study was to evaluate the usefulness of ultrasonic methods: ultrasonography and Doppler C.W. in the diagnosis of superficial varicose phlebitis. Especially, measurement of the venous pressure (V.P.) at the posterior tibial (P.T.) and the greater saphenous vein (G.S.V.) in clino and orthostatism, have proved to be useful. In ten cases, one patient with a varicose in the thigh, was also found to have a femoral vein thrombosis secondary to a deep thrombus entering the junction. In conclusion, these non-invasive methods are advisable, especially in patients presenting a varicose phlebitis at the thigh.
