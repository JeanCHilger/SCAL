Efficacy of indobufen in the treatment of intermittent claudication. The aim of this trial was to assess the activity of indobufen compared with placebo in peripheral occlusive arterial disease of the lower limbs of atherosclerotic or diabetic origin. Fifty-two outpatients were admitted to the randomized, double-blind study and were given either an indobufen 200-mg tablet (28 subjects) or placebo (24) for six months. Painfree walking distance on a treadmill at a constant speed (4 km/h) and slope (10 degrees) was assessed before and after three and six months' treatment. The painfree walking distance before treatment with indobufen or placebo averaged 153 +/- 23.02 (mean +/- SE) and 199 +/- 30.58 (mean +/- SE) meters respectively. After six months' treatment with active drug or placebo, this parameter reached 610 +/- 115.36 (p less than 0.01) and 243 +/- 32.49 (p greater than 0.05) meters respectively. The difference between the two treatments was statistically significant in favor of indobufen (p less than 0.01 Dunn's test).
