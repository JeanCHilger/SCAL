Habituation of vasodilatation in the calf elicited by repeated sensory stimulation in man. In 28 subjects the cardiovascular response to repeated stimulation was monitored during six daily sessions. Calf blood flow was measured with mercury-in-silastic venous occlusion plethysmography, blood pressure with electronic sphygmomanometer. The stimuli used were: 1 kHz sound of 90 dB and 100 dB intensity and immersion of one foot for 60 s in water at 4 degrees C. Initially sounds induced large vasodilatation in the calf, immersion of one foot in the water induced in the contralateral calf vasodilatation in one group and vasoconstriction in another group of subjects. The blood pressure changes were less prominent and less consistent. After the first session of repeated stimulation the vascular response during the second session was significantly diminished. The reduction of the vasodilatation was the most rapid. During the remaining 5 days the responses were suppressed. It has been established that in the patients in the initial stage of hypertension the ability to habituate vascular response is impaired (Zbrozyna and Krebbel 1985). It is therefore suggested that the test of the ability for long-term vascular habituation could be used as a supplementary diagnostic test.
