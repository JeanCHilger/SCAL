Efficacy of echo-Doppler examination for the evaluation of renovascular disease. The accuracy of the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis using noninvasive echo-Doppler velocimetry was compared with that of angiography in 40 renal arteries. The duplex-Doppler signals were detected through the muscle of the back (the translumbar approach). Renal artery stenosis was diagnosed by three objectively defined Doppler parameters, the acceleration index (AI), the acceleration time (AT), and the acceleration time ratio (ATR). The normal range obtained on 11 control subjects was defined as AI greater than or equal to 3.78, AT less than or equal to 0.07 s, and ATR less than or equal to 1.35. High technological success (98%) was obtained using the translumbar approach. In comparison with angiography (cases of significant stenosis), the accuracy of the echo-Doppler method using the criteria of the AI was 95%, the sensitivity was 100%, and the specificity was 93%. This noninvasive method may be one of the most accurate screening methods for diagnosing significant renal artery stenosis.
