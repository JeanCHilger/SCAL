Long-term followup of penetrating abdominal aortic injuries after 15 years. Eleven of 14 survivors who sustained trauma to the abdominal aorta have been evaluated 16 to 18 years after injury through personal interview, physical examination, and abdominal contrast computerized tomography (CCT). The average age of survivors was 39 years (range, 37-47). All patients had minimal debridement of the aortic injury with lateral arteriorrhaphy. No patients had symptoms of arterial insufficiency. However, five patients had abnormal ankle/brachial indices (ABI). In four patients, ABI was less than 1.00 at rest and a fifth patient's ABI decreased significantly: 0.60 left and 0.65 right from an average of 1.00 bilaterally after standardized exercise treadmill. CCT evaluation revealed aortic calcification in five patients in the area of aortic injury. Aortic calcification occurred only in the patients with abnormal ABI's. This long-term followup identifies no evidence for late compromise in the aorta however, there is a suggestion that injury and repair may contribute to the accelerated development of atherosclerosis.
