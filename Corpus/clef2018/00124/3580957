Hepatic venous resistance site in the dog: localization and validation of intrahepatic pressure measurements. Intrahepatic pressure (9.4 +/- 0.3 mmHg 1 mmHg = 133.32 Pa), measured proximal to a hepatic venous resistance site, was insignificantly different from portal venous pressure (9.6 +/- 0.4 mmHg). This lobar venous pressure is not wedged hepatic venous pressure as it is measured from side holes in a catheter with a sealed tip. Validation of the lobar venous pressure measurement was done in a variety of ways and using different sizes and configurations of catheters. The site of hepatic venous resistance in the dog is localized to a narrow sphincterlike region about 0.5 cm in length and within 1-2 cm (usually within 1 cm) of the junction of the vena cava and hepatic veins. Sinusoidal and portal venous resistance appears insignificant in the basal state and large increases in liver blood volume (histamine infusion or passive vena caval occlusion) or large decreases in liver blood volume (passive vascular occlusion) do not alter the insignificant pressure gradient between portal and lobar venous pressures. Norepinephrine infusion (1.25 microgram X kg-1 X min-1 intraportal) and hepatic sympathetic nerve stimulation (10 Hz) led to a significantly greater rise in portal venous pressure than in lobar venous pressure, indicating some presinusoidal (and (or) sinusoidal) constriction and this indicates that lobar venous pressure cannot be assumed under all conditions to accurately reflect portal pressure. However, most of the rise in portal venous pressure induced by intraportal infusion of norepinephrine or nerve stimulation and virtually all of the pressure rise induced by histamine could be attributed to the postsinusoidal resistance site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
