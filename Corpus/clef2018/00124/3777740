Arterial stenoses of the arms in Horton's temporal arteritis. Apropos of 3 cases. A review of the literature. The authors describe three histologically documented cases of temporal arteritis complicated by arteritis of the upper limbs confirmed by arteriography. The evolution during treatment was followed up until recovery. A review of the literature underlines the frequency of upper limb arteritis in Horton's disease. It may be the presenting feature or, more commonly, occur during the evolution of the condition. It may give rise to ischaemic symptoms and/or an arterial bruit and/or asymmetric blood pressure readings which should be looked for routinely. Doppler ultrasound may be helpful. Arteriography shows that the lesions are usually bilateral, on the subclavian and axillary arteries. Giant cell arteritis has been found on arterial biopsy. Upper limb arteritis necessitates renewed or increased steroid therapy which may be beneficial in the absence of thrombosis. These arterial lesions have also been reported in some cases of polymyalgia rheumatica. Several cases of isolated upper limb arteritis without temporal arteritis or polymyalgia rheumatica have also been described.
