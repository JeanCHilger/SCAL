Traumatic vascular lesions associated with fractures and dislocations. From May 1977 to January 1983, 270 patients with traumatic vascular lesions were treated in our Service. Among these, 27 presented associated fractures and/or dislocations. A high index of suspicion, the early recognition of the presence of vascular injury by thorough clinical evaluation, routine use of the Doppler flowmeter and broad indication of preoperative angiography resulted in prompt repair of these lesions in the majority of cases. Early exploration, wide fasciotomies, use of temporary intraluminal shunts during the bone fixation procedures (usually by internal plates), definitive venous and arterial repair after limb stabilization was achieved and frequent use of intraoperative angiography were the predominant factors in the treatment and outcome in these complex injuries. All eight limbs with closed fractures and/or dislocations were preserved, as well as 17 of 19 (89%) of the limbs with open or exposed skeletal injuries, resulting in a limb salvage rate of 92.6%.
