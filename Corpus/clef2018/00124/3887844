Acceleration ratio measurements with ultrasound Doppler in patients with occlusive arterial disease. A prospective investigation. A prospective investigation was performed concerning the clinical value of Doppler examination with a flow velocity profile analysis using the quotient (AR) between the acceleration of velocity in a supposed diseased artery as compared with the acceleration of flow velocity in a healthy artery. Seventy-nine patients with peripheral arterial disease were followed at least one year after angiography which was performed as a preoperative examination. Comparing AR with angiography and blood pressure measurements it was found that AR values were affected favourably by development of good collaterals. AR less than or equal to 0.25 (Doppler frequency 5 MHz) in the best artery of the foot was found in all patients where amputation had to be performed, and in 36 of 44 legs treated with vascular reconstruction.
