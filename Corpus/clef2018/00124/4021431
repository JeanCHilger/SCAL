Oculo-oscillodynamography, a new procedure for the determination of ophthalmic artery blood pressure and ocular pulse curve analysis. OODG is a diagnostic method permitting assessment of ocular pulse curves and objective determination of blood pressures in the ophthalmic circulatory system (retinal and ciliary arterial blood pressures) simultaneously for both eyes, without dilatation of the pupils. Calibrated scleral suction cups pneumatically connected to a sensitive transducer are used to provide well reproducible ocular pulse recordings. The systolic retinal and ciliary arterial blood pressures and the diastolic ocular blood pressure are determined at artificially elevated IOPs from typical changes in the ocular pulse curves.
