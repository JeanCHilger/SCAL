Role of vein patch angioplasty in isolated operations for profunda femoris stenosis and disabling claudication. This report has described the treatment of disabling claudication by correction of profunda femoris artery stenosis. Vein patch angioplasty and endarterectomy with primary closure were the procedures used. An overall success rate of 71 percent was noted with no significant complications, however, the angioplasty group had a higher likelihood of success (83 percent versus 40 percent). They also were noted to have a significantly improved ankle-arm Doppler index, with a mean follow-up of 21 months. Possible explanations for these observations have been considered and technical recommendations discussed.
