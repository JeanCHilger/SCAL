Value of plethysmographic methods as a means of monitoring arteriopathies. Plethysmography provides an original solution to the study of arteriopathy, complementing other non-invasive investigational methods. The different fields of application are discussed, and the diagnostic and prognostic value of each of them outlined. Methods used include: pulsed plethysmography, measurement of segmental pressures, hyperemia test, irrigraphy and measurement of segmental blood flow. Principal advantages of the technique are undoubtedly the evaluation of global function, monitoring of therapy and, to some degree, prediction of course.
