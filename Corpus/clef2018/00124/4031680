Vascular functional exploratory methods enabling the assessment of the evolution of lower-limb arteriopathies in the critical phase. Pulpal pulsed signal, digital pressure, transcutaneous PO2 of the front of the foot. Preliminary notes. Various situations are defined in which viability of a lower limb is compromised and for which clinical data may be insufficient to assess any very short-term progressive tendency during medical or surgical therapy. Among techniques for exploration of vascular function, parameters of pressure and digital pulsatility and measurement of front of foot transcutaneous PO2 can be considered to be reliable means of determination of the degree of permanent ischemia. Their application to assessment of changes in course during therapy is proposed as a supplement to clinical data.
