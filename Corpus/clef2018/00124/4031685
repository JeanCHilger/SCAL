The amplification factor of the Hillestad reactional hyperemia test as a function of glucose status, clinical status and ankle pressure index. Principles of the reactive hyperemia test are summarized, the method used defined and the amplification factor f described as the ratio of the post-ischemia amplitude of pulsed plethysmographic signal to its baseline amplitude before arterial occlusion. Values for this factor were determined in patients free from occlusive arterial lesions with or without glucose metabolism disorders, in cases after sympathectomy and in patients with lower limb arterial disease stage I-II and extensive occlusive lesions and in stage III-IV. The factor f is either the reflection of the state of vasodilation or vasoconstriction of the lower limbs studied, or the sign of a diabetic neuroangiopathy. Its study requires comparison of values in both limbs of the same subject.
