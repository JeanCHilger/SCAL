A non-invasive index of leg arterial perfusion pressure during walking, derived from cutaneous toe temperature. This article describes and evaluates a non-invasive technique for continuous monitoring of hemodynamic changes in the legs during walking. The method involves monitoring of cutaneous toe temperature. In six normal subjects we have shown that, during exercise under carefully controlled conditions, a unique steady-state toe temperature exists for any given leg arterial perfusion pressure, when perfusion pressure is varied by means of an external occluding ankle cuff. Further, we have demonstrated a strong correlation between this external ankle cuff pressure and the time rate of changes of toe temperature during the test-period following occlusion. Correlation coefficients, r1, were between -1 and -0.88 (mean -0.95 standard deviation +/- 0.03) for big toe and between -1 and -0.87 (mean -0.94
