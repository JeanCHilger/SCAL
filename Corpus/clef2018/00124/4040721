Hemodynamic effects of intravenous PGE1 on patients with arterial occlusive disease of the leg. In 42 patients with arterial occlusive disease of the leg, the hemodynamic effects of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) given intravenously were studied. Blood pressure of the leg and crest time of the pulse wave did not change significantly, while increases in blood flow at the calf and foot, amplitude of the pulse wave, velocity, and skin temperature at the foot and toes were significant. Skin temperature of the calf dropped significantly. The increase in blood flow, velocity, and skin temperature was significantly more dominant in the distal part of the leg than that in the proximal part. In separate observation of individuals, 12 of the 66 legs with arterial occlusive disease (18%) showed a decrease in skin temperature at the toes. The steal phenomenon was observed most frequently in limbs with rest pain, gangrene, or both.
