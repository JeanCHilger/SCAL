Spironolactone in the treatment of portal hypertension in liver cirrhosis. A new therapeutic principle?. Five patients with liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension and oesophageal varices received spironolactone in daily doses of 50-200 mg. Measurements of hepatic vein occlusion pressure at intervals of 1 to 5 months showed a pressure reduction of between 9 and 11 mm Hg. Thus the pressure lowering effect of spironolactone is about the same as that of beta-blockers. Since spironolactone is without the well known side effects of beta-blockers this therapeutic approach has wide application in the long term drug therapy of portal hypertension.
