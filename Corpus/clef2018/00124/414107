Practical diagnosis of arterial occlusive diseases of the lower extremities (author's transl). A peripheral arterial occlusive disease can be diagnosed by a clinical examination. Technical methods serve for documentation, definition of localization and differentiation of doubtful findings and special therapeutic measures. A definite sequence of diagnostic procedures simplifies diagnosis. History (risk factors), individual clinical or biochemical findings, intermittent claudication, pain at rest are important for the assessment of peripheral arterial circulation when considered with the appropriate differential diagnosis of various internal disease conditions, inspection, palpation and especially auscultation at rest and on effort. Ratschow's circulation test provides information on the degree of compensation. Mechanical or electronic oscillography and Doppler echography have proved valuable as technical methods for measuring post-stenotic pressure.
