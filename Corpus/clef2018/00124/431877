The clofibrate-dipyridamole combination in the treatment of athero-arteriosclerotic vasculopathy. A group of patients with athero-arteriosclerotic vascular disease (coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis of the extremities) have been subjected to platelet antiaggregating-antidyslipidaemic treatment with a chlofibrate-dipyridamol association a control series was treated with chlofibrate alone. Frequency of angina pectoris, pain intensity and trinitrine consumption ware evaluated in patients with coronary heart disease, claudicometry, oscillometry and thermometry in patients with atherosclerosis of the extremities. The following laboratory parameters were also analysed: cholesterolaemia, triglyceridaemia, prothrombin activity, fibrinogenaemia, uricaemia and tolerance of oral glucose loading. Analysis of the results has shown that the association improved the parameters considered in statistically significant fashion
