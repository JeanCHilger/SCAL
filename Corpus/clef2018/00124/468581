Determination of the conditions of extra-anatomical arterial cross-over-shunts. Extra anatomical cross-over-shunts are feasible even when the lending extremity is itself afflicted by obliterative arterial disease provided that 1. global irrigation of the lending extremity exceeds perfusion of the borrowing extremity, 2. pulse-volume-recording (PVR) corresponds to categories 1--3 as defined by Raines, 3. ankle pressure of the lending extremity is not less than 70 mm of mercury or 4. ankle pressure of the leading extremity corresponds to 60% or more than the systemic blood pressure.
