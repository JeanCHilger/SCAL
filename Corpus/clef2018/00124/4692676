Deep vein thrombosis in a Queensland hospital. Investigation in the postoperative period of 75 patients by means of the radioiodinated fibrinogen uptake method, by the use of the Doppler ultrasonic flow detector, and by clinical assessment revealed an incidence of deep vein thrombosis of only 12%. This is distinctly lower than has been reported by other investigators using the same techniques both in Australia and elsewhere. It appears from this study and associated work that the Doppler ultrasonic technique is sufficiently accurate to be of value in the clinical diagnosis of significant deep vein thrombosis.
