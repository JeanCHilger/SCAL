Hemodynamic studies before and after extended bypass grafts to the tibial and personeal arteries. Thirty-ones limbs of 29 consecutive patients undergoing bypass grafts to the tibial or peroneal arteries were studied. Twenty-five limbs had ischemic rest pain with or without localized gangrene, and six had incapacitating claudication. The mean segmental pressure indices were upper thigh, 1.16 +/- 0.36 above knee, 0.71 +/- 0.30
