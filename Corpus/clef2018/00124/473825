Doppler-sonographic findings in media sclerosis of the extremities, verified by radiography. 23 patients were examined who in the ultrasound-Doppler-pressure measurement were evident by too large peripheral systolic measuring values. On the X-ray pictures of the soft tissues of these patients more or less expressed linear and longitudinal calcifications of the vascular wall in the sense of a MÃ¶nckeberg sclerosis of the media were to be proved. Though these changes of the arteries which are to be established in most cases in diabetics of older age do not cause, as a rule, any disturbances of the peripheral blood supply, they are of clinical interest, since they falsify the results of indirect measurements of the pressure (pseudohypertension). An arterial obstructive disease which is simultaneously present may possibly been overseen and the false diagnosis of a therapy-resistant arterial hypertension may be made.
