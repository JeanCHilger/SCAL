Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of aortic graft stenoses. Postoperative aortic graft anastomotic stenoses at nine sites in eight patients were successfully treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. There was a decrease in peak systolic pressure gradient in all eight patients, and in seven of the eight patients symptoms of claudication disappeared immediately after angioplasty. Four of the eight patients remained asymptomatic at follow-up. Ankle/arm indices were obtained before and after angioplasty in five patients, with postangioplasty improvement in all five.
