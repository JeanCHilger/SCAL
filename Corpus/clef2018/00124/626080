Limb circulation in anorexia nervosa. Blood flow, skin temperature and blood pressure of the lower limbs and the effect of indirect, radiant heat on calf blood flow and leg skin temperature was determined in sixteen children with anorexia nervosa (group A) and fourteen healthy children (group H) of the same age and body height. Calf blood flow as measured by venous occlusion plethysmography. Arm blood pressure was obtained by tourniquet and toe pressure and digital plethysmograms by a strain-gauge. Skin temperature was measured with a thermocouple. In group A calf blood flow was about 50--60% lower than the mean values observed in group H and a marked difference was maintained after the heat load. Skin temperature of the knees and toes were higher in group H. Systolic arm blood pressure and toe pressure were on the average 20 mmHg and 13 mmHg lower in group A. It is suggested that there is a heat-conserving, selective peripheral vasoconstriction in the anorexic patients.
