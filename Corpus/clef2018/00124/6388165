Acute peripheral ischemia syndrome. The six "P" are characteristic clinical symptoms of acute peripheral ischemia. Diagnostic problems can be considered in approximately 33%. Doppler-ultrasound technique is the most frequent method used to verify the clinical diagnosis. Angiography was necessary only in 35% of our cases. Methods of recanalisation are individual and depend on aetiology and localisation of the occlusion. 60-90% of acute ischemic extremities can be saved by new techniques of fibrinolysis and surgery, if the therapy will be carried out within six hours.
