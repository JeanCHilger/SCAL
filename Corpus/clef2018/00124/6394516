Haemodynamic changes in peripheral arterial circulation during antihypertensive treatment with captopril, methyldopa and indapamide. Structural changes in resistance vessels of the lower limbs have been detected in early stages of arterial hypertension. In these patients it might be important to reduce blood pressure by drugs which do not impair peripheral blood flow. Twenty-four patients with arterial hypertension, without target organ damage were randomly given a placebo, 50 mg captopril, 500 mg methyldopa or 2.5 mg indapamide and their blood pressure, arterial blood flow and peripheral resistance were measured at baseline and at the peak action of the antihypertensive treatment. Significant decreases in blood pressure and peripheral resistance have been induced by a single oral dose of captopril and methyldopa: a concomitant significant increase in peripheral blood flow to the lower limbs was also observed during methyldopa treatment. No acute effect was observed on the placebo or on indapamide: the latter induced a decrease in blood pressure and in peripheral resistance along with an increase in arterial blood flow during long-term treatment after four weeks of therapy. Our observations seem to support the usefulness in hypertensive patients with concomitant lesions in the peripheral arterial tree of antihypertensive agents such as methyldopa and indapamide which increase blood flow and reduce peripheral resistance while lowering high blood pressure.
