Assessment of donor limb hemodynamics in femorofemoral bypass for claudication. During a 5-year period (1975 to 1980), 44 patients underwent femorofemoral bypass for unilateral disabling claudication caused by iliac atheroocclusive disease. All patients had complete Doppler arterial examination performed pre- and postoperatively, including segmental thigh and ankle pressure and calculation of an ankle/brachial (A/B) index for each limb. In 37 patients, standard treadmill exercise testing was performed before and after femorofemoral grafting. Hemodynamic improvement in the symptomatic limb was evidenced by an increase in resting A/B index from a mean of 0.54 +/- 0.14 before to 0.76 +/- 0.22 after operation (P less than 0.001). Exercise tests which were abnormal in all 37 recipient limbs preoperatively were improved. Six of the seven unimproved recipient limbs had associated femoropopliteal occlusion. Donor limb mean resting ankle/brachial index fell from 0.93 +/- 0.22 before to 0.83 +/- 0.22 after surgery (P less than 0.05). However, in 13 of 23 donor limbs, exercise response which had been normal before surgery became abnormal. Additionally, in 14 patients with abnormal donor limb exercise response before grafting, seven limbs had a significantly worsening of the exercise response postoperatively. These findings were not related to the patency of the superficial femoral artery in the donor limb. Deterioration in donor limb hemodynamics noted in 20 (45%) of the 44 patients in this series suggests that strict patient selection criteria should be maintained. Unlike in healthy subjects, an arteriographically patent atherosclerosis iliac artery may not support flow requirements of bilateral lower limb exercise.
