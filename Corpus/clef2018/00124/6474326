Combined use of Doppler ultrasound and phleborheography in suspected deep venous thrombosis. Doppler ultrasound and PRG were compared with the results of venography in 216 limbs with suspected DVT. Equivocal or conflicting noninvasive test results were obtained in 40 limbs and thrombi were demonstrated venographically in 18 of these (45 per cent). In the remaining 176 limbs, the sensitivity of the noninvasive test was 88 per cent and the specificity was 99 per cent. Treatment may be confidently chosen without venographic confirmation when the results of Doppler ultrasound and PRG agree. Venography is indicated in the minority of instances when the two noninvasive test results do not agree or are equivocal.
