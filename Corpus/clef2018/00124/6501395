Direct femoral artery pressure measurement at rest and during reactive hyperemia in the evaluation of the aorto-iliac segment. Direct femoral artery pressure (FAP) studies with reactive hyperemia (RH) were performed on 39 extremities which underwent a proximal or distal reconstruction for angiographically multilevel disease. The half-year clinical results were correlated with the FAP studies. A second group of patients underwent FAP studies and angiography and both studies were correlated. The conclusions from the studies are in the first place that FAP studies with RH are an accurate way to assess the aorto-iliac segment without giving any complications secondly that observation of single plane angiography tends to overestimate aorto-iliac disease. Finally, criteria are proposed which can help in the clinical decision whether to perform a distal or a proximal reconstruction in multilevel atherosclerotic disease.
