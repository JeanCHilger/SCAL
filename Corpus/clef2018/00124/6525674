Usefulness of morphoscillography for the prognosis of the duration of aorta-femoral bypass in complex ilio-femoral arteriopathies. The work has the purpose to draw some prognostic indications and therapeutical directions in the aorto-iliac arteriosclerotic disease, with reference to the preoperative arteriographic and morphoscillographic reports. In the 94 patients, corresponding to 140 limbs operated on, it was possible to remark the progression in worsening of the sphygmic activity in the limbs segments goes along with a deterioration of the surgical results, and the prognosis is particularly severe when the minimum values of total vascular caliber are remarked at thighs.
