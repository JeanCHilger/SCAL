Influence of circulating NE and Epi on adipose tissue vascular resistance and lipolysis in humans. The effects of circulating norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (Epi) on vascular resistance in subcutaneous adipose tissue and the calf as well as on plasma glycerol, an indicator of lipolysis, were studied in healthy volunteers. Adipose tissue blood flow was determined by the local clearance of 99mTcO-4 or 133Xe. The two isotopes gave similar results. Calf blood flow was determined by venous occlusion plethysmography. Intravenous infusion of NE caused increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressures, adipose tissue and calf vascular resistances, and plasma glycerol and a decrease in plasma insulin and heart rate, all of which were significant when arterial plasma NE was elevated from 1.17 +/- 0.14 to 8.38 +/- 0.30 nM (n = 16). Epi reduced diastolic and mean arterial pressures and adipose tissue and calf vascular resistances and increased plasma glycerol without affecting systolic blood pressure or plasma insulin. An increase of arterial plasma Epi from 0.20 +/- 0.03 to 1.15 +/- 0.05 nM (n = 6) was sufficient to induce vasodilatation in adipose tissue and lipolysis. Human adipose tissue differs from canine adipose tissue inasmuch as Epi causes vasodilatation in humans (present results) but vasoconstriction in the dog (previous results), presumably due to a predominance of vascular beta 2-adrenoceptors in human and beta 1-adrenoceptors in canine adipose tissue. Furthermore, Epi is a considerably more potent lipolytic hormone than NE in humans but not in the dog. Our results indicate that both NE and Epi may influence human adipose tissue blood flow and lipolysis as circulating hormones.
