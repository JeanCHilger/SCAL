The hemodynamics of pelvic circulation after reconstructive aorto-iliac surgery. An attempt is made to identify the factors responsible for pelvic haemodynamic modification following aorto-iliac reconstructive surgery. 24 patients submitted to operation for aorto-iliac arterial lesions have been assessed pre- and post-operatively as regards capacity of erection. The penile-brachial index obtained by way of a Doppler sound technique is used as a parameter. The type of reconstruction, extent and bilaterality of the lesions are the factors influencing a change in the index after. intervention. Although there are many causes underlying erection, a reduction of this index should not be provoked below given values that are in themselves capable of conditioning vascular-based impotence.
