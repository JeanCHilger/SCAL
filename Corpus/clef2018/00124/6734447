Doppler frequency spectrum analysis of extracranial carotid artery lesions. Signals registered from the extracranial carotid artery by direct Doppler-ultrasound with a MHz transducer were subjected to real-time frequency spectrum analysis. A systolic maximal frequency over 3500 Hz was considered abnormal, together with a broadened spectrum. The study was made on 157 subsequently operated carotid arteries, not all of which had previous angiographic studies. Of 47 with a normal angiogram 45 were correctly classified non-invasively (specificity 96%). The non-invasive diagnosis was correct in 16 of 17 occlusions of the internal carotid artery demonstrated angiographically. An abnormal Doppler frequency analysis was present in only 7 of 14 stenoses with a decreased vessel lumen below 25%. An abnormal Doppler frequency analysis was present in 78 of 79 stenoses with more than 25% reduction in lumen diameter, diagnostic sensitivity for all stenoses being 91%.
