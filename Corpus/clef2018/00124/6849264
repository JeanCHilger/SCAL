Spectrum of global left ventricular responses to supine exercise. Limitation in the use of ejection fraction in identifying patients with coronary artery disease. Left ventricular function was evaluated with rest and supine bicycle exercise-multigated blood pool scans in 53 patients who had previously undergone coronary angiography for evaluation of a chest pain syndrome. There were 21 normal patients (less than 25% stenosis in any coronary artery, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure less than or equal to 12 mm Hg, and normal left ventriculography) and 32 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) (greater than 50% narrowing in 1 or more major coronary arteries). Thirty-two (60%) were receiving propranolol at the time of the study. The normal patient group had a significant increase in mean ejection fraction (EF) during exercise (+0.08 +/- 0.09), while the CAD group had no increase (0 +/- 0.11 p less than 0.05). Mean end-systolic volume decreased significantly in the normal group (-5 +/- 8 ml/m2) but demonstrated no significant change in the CAD group (1 +/- 12 ml/m2
