Physiological interpretation of Doppler shift waveforms: the femorodistal segment in combined disease. A new method is presented for assessing the femorodistal segment in multisegmental arterial disease, using the Laplace transform technique of Doppler waveform analysis. Blood velocity/time waveforms were obtained at femoral and ankle levels in three groups of limbs--50 without arterial disease, 12 with isolated aortoiliac stenoses, and 32 with femoropopliteal occlusions, with and without proximal disease. The waveforms were analysed for Laplace transform and pulsatility index values. The omega 0 coefficients of the Laplace transform analysis at femoral and ankle levels were compared in each subject, as the omega 0 gradient (femoral/ankle omega 0): and pulsatility index damping factor (femoral/ankle P1) was also calculated. The omega 0 gradient was shown to detect femoropopliteal occlusion in the presence of multisegmental arterial disease and to give some indication of its haemodynamic significance. The diagnostic accuracy of the omega 0 gradient was superior to that of pulsatility index damping factor. When combined with its existing ability to detect aortoiliac stenosis, this new application of the Laplace transform method offers the possibility both of a system for complete localisation of significant arterial lesions, and potential for follow-up of vascular surgical procedures in the lower limb, from two simple Doppler recordings.
