Stenoses and occlusions of the innominate trunk (author's transl). Direct comparison with neuroradiologic and surgical data show that stenoses and occlusions of the innominate trunk may be recognized safely by Doppler ultrasound despite localisation close to the aorta. Formation of sonographically demonstrable and haemodynamically complicated vascular by-passes is the reason for the mainly asymptomatic or very uncharacteristic complaints of these cases (78%) among the relatively rare stenosing occlusions of the lumen (0,65%) of the innominate trunk (18 out of 2768 patients). Only in four cases were there focal neurological losses or symptoms of hypoperfusion of the arm. Invasive diagnostic measures should thus be used sparingly. The indication for vascular surgery should be limited to a few cases as long as the natural course of these extracranial vascular changes and the risk of cerebral injury have not been established with certainty.
