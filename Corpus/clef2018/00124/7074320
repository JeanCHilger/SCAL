Detection of carotid bifurcation disease: comparison of ultrasound tests with angiography. Doppler-shift ultrasound with spectral analysis permits the measurement of the relative heights of systolic peaks (the A/B ratio) in blood velocity sonograms from supra-orbital and common carotid arteries, the temporal artery occlusion test, the common carotid resistance index and transit times of flow-velocity waves in the internal carotid pathway. The results are compared with 201 carotid angiograms and expressed in terms of sensitivity (true positive) and specificity (true negative). Supra-orbital and common carotid A/B ratios, in combination with the temporal artery occlusion test, detected all grades of carotid artery disease with a sensitivity of 72 per cent and a specificity of 93 per cent. The corrected transit time gave a sensitivity of 57 per cent and a specificity of 89 per cent, whilst the Resistance Index gave a sensitivity of 60 per cent and a specificity of 80 per cent. The values of ultrasound parameters associated with severe disease, defined as reductions in lumen diameter of 75 per cent or more, of the internal carotid artery are examined. The temporal artery occlusion test gave a sensitivity of 91 per cent and a specificity of 94 per cent. These results were more accurate than those obtained for the corrected transit time (sensitivity 83 per cent, specificity 92 per cent) and for the Resistance Index (sensitivity 75 per cent and specificity 92 per cent). The results show that of the tests described the supra-orbital and common carotid artery A/B ratios, together with the temporal artery occlusion test, gave the best sensitivity and specificity for detection of both severe and minor carotid bifurcation disease.
