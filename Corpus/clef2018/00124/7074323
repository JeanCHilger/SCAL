A simple parameter for accurate detection of severe carotid disease. The value of the ratio of the peak systolic velocity in the internal carotid artery to the end diastolic velocity in the common carotid artery in quantifying the severity of carotid arteriosclerosis has been investigated in 86 diseased vessels and 30 normal vessels. The ratio permitted gradation of disease into 60 per cent stenosis and greater with 95 per cent accuracy, 65 per cent stenosis and greater with 97 per cent accuracy and greater than 90 per cent stenosis with 100 per cent accuracy. The values for 30 normal sides studied fell below those of the 60 per cent stenosis group. The ratio has a value in predicting the severity of disease in the internal carotid artery in those with a 60 per cent stenosis and greater.
