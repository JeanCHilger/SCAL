Usefulness of Doppler ultrasound method in the diagnosis of cerebrovascular disorders. The authors carried out ultrasonographic investigations in 136 patients with disturbances of the cerebral circulation and compared them with the results of clinical observations. In a high proportion of cases an agreement was found between the results of ultrasonographic investigations and clinical observations. Besides that, the authors call attention to the importance of these Doppler ultrasonographic investigations in the so called silent cases without clinical signs, and in patients with progressing atherosclerotic changes, particularly in the qualification of these patients for surgical procedures.
