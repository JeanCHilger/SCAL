Results of examination of cerebral arteries by the Doppler ultrasound method as compared to angiographic results. The result of angiographic and ultrasonographic investigations were compared in 87 patients with cerebral circulation disturbances. A high degree of agreement (79%) was demonstrated between the results of Doppler ultrasonography and angiography. The authors stress the importance of ultrasonographic investigations in the differential diagnosis between stenosis and occlusion of these arteries and call attention to the possibility of repeated investigations enabling the progression of atherosclerotic lesions to be observed.
