Necrotizing erysipelas--connections with angiological diseases. Necrotizing erysipelas (NE) is a variant of erysipelas with a relatively severe course. 12 patients were examined for predisposing factors of necrotizing. In only one of them, the face was involved, and in the rest the lower extremities. In 10 cases, a chronic arterial occlusive disease was detected by the Doppler-ultrasound. In 5 patients we found a diabetes mellitus, simultaneously. In a further diabetic patient, it was not possible to measure the regional blood pressure, because of the location of the NE in the face. In two cases we found a diabetic retinopathy. Only in one patient the arterial ankle pressure was normal.
