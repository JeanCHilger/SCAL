The role of penile Doppler sonography in the diagnosis of vascular impotence. Preliminary studies. Normal, potent arteriopathic and impotent arteriopathic subjects have been studied by means of the Doppler method for the determination of penile systolic pressure. A penile systolic pressure value less than 75 mmHg and a penisarm pressure index of than 0.55 were always associated with impotence. If present in the arteriopathic, impotence is not always caused by vascular factors.
