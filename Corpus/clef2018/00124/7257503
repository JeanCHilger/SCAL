Strain-gauge-plethysmography in consideration with finger venous occlusion plethysmography. A critical view of its methods and diagnostic possibilities (author's transl). The strain-gauge plethysmography, which has already successfully been applied to the calf and forearm the past years, has now, after extensive technical perfection, also been applied to the finger. Particular importance has to be paid to the selection of the measurement gauge and the cuff. Developed was a method to measure correct fit of the finger gauge to promote nearly a 100% correct registration of finger circumference. In order to get a proportionate distribution of the pressure inside the cuff cuffs with a deep-drawn relief on the inside are used. The different temperatures on the hand, essential for functional diagnostic, are produced by an electronically regulated water-bath.
