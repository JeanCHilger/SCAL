Comparison of Doppler ultrasonography with arteriography of the carotid artery bifurcation. Continuous-wave (CW) Doppler ultrasound imaging for prediction of arteriogrphic abnormality at the carotid bifurcation was carried out in 195 arteries of 105 patients. The Doppler method had no predictive value when compared to angiographic findings in arteries classified as 0-50% stenosis by Doppler. In 50-75% stenosis by arteriography Doppler accuracy was 52%. With stenosis of 76-99% Doppler imaging correlated with 71% reliability. When an arteriogram was compared with Doppler imaging the latter gave a "false negative" reading in 56% and "false positive" readings in 19%. We conclude that Doppler ultrasound evaluation provides important information regarding the state of the carotid bifurcation, which supplements the bedside evaluation, but it does not substitute for arteriography.
