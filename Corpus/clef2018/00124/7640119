Continuous measurement of cardiac output during aortic cross-clamping by the oesophageal Doppler monitor ODM 1. We have compared the Doppler against the thermodilution technique for measurement of cardiac output in six patients during aortic surgery. The correlation coefficient between the two methods was between 0.76 and 0.84 during the different periods of the operation. Using the integral nomogram instead of direct calibration, the Doppler system underestimated cardiac output in atherosclerotic patients. However, the Doppler method did register accurately significant changes in cardiac output.
