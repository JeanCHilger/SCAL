Quantitative analysis of the peripheral arterial blood pressure curve in patients with peripheral obstructive cardiomyopathy after premature beats (author's transl). Changes of the brachial artery pressure curves after mechanically released extrasystoles were investigated in 20 patients suffering from hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. Diagnosis was confirmed by heart catheterisation and laevocardiography. At the average, the postextrasystolic beat showed a more pronounced reduction of the pressure at the systolic dip and the second systolic peak (19.7 +/- 14.2 and 17.2 +/- 13.8) than at the first systolic peak and the incisure due to the aortic valve closure (8.4 +/- 10.5 and 12.8 +/- 9.9). The diastolic pressure decreased of about 11 +/- 4.9%.--The ejection time of the postextrasystolic beat increased of about 0.029 sec (at rest 0.335 +/- 0.047 sec). Compared to the presystolic beats these changes were significant.
