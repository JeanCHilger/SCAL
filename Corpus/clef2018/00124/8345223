Microcirculatory functions in systemic sclerosis: additional parameters for therapeutic concepts? To study the functional reactivity of the cutaneous microcirculation in progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS), hyperemic responses after arterial occlusion (3 min) and during local heating (42 degrees C) were investigated with simultaneous measurements of red blood cell flux and cutaneous oxygen tension (pcuO2) of the skin in female patients (n = 19) with PSS and in healthy female controls (n = 15). Additionally, serum levels of 6-keto-prostaglandin 1 alpha (PGF1 alpha), a stable metabolite of prostacyclin, were compared to the microcirculatory data, and both were used to evaluate further a standardized therapy with 10-d intravenous calcitonin (100 IU/d) infusion in six PSS patients. In PSS, the initial mean pcuO2 value was significantly reduced and was inversely proportional to flux and to PGF1 alpha levels, whereas the flux and pcuO2 responses to the above hyperemic stimuli showed significant reductions, revealing a pattern of "hyperemic hypoxia" probably due to exhausted functional reserves of cutaneous perfusion. During calcitonin infusion significant rises in pcuO2 and temporarily in PGF1 alpha and flux were found. After 10 d of therapy, increased pcuO2 was associated significantly with decreased flux, indicating a shifting of blood from deeper regulatory vessels to the subepidermal capillaries. Both clinical improvement and the results of microcirculatory measurements demonstrate a beneficial effect of calcitonin on the cutaneous microcirculation in PSS patients, possibly due in part to a short-term increase in release of endogenous prostacyclin from the vascular endothelium during the infusion. The disturbed reactivity of the dermal vessels in PSS is important for the evaluation of therapeutic concepts and stresses, together with the elevated PGF1 alpha plasma levels, vascular factors in the pathogenesis of PSS.
