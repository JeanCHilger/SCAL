Arterial mapping with color flow duplex imaging of the lower extremities after excimer-laser-assisted angioplasty. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the role of color flow duplex imaging (CFDI) in the follow-up of patients who have undergone excimer-laser-assisted angioplasty of peripheral arteries. Sixty-one patients (40 men and 21 women) were studied (mean age +/- SD sixty-three +/- nine years). All patients were affected by peripheral vascular disease and, for this reason, underwent percutaneous excimer-laser-assisted angioplasty. Digital angiography and CFDI were performed before the laser procedure. CFDI was repeated at months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 after the laser procedure, whereas angiography was repeated after twelve months. Common, superficial, and profunda femoral arteries and popliteal arteries were visualized in looking for the presence of lesions and occlusions, and spectral analysis of Doppler signals was recorded. After the initial success, claudication was reported again by 9 patients, 7 of whom showed total occlusions. All reocclusions were discovered by CFDI and confirmed by angiography 3 of these 7 patients underwent a second laser procedure. The remaining 2 symptomatic patients showed patent vessels and did not undergo angiography. Another 9 patients redeveloped an occlusion, unsuspected from clinical history and symptoms. All the reocclusions, confirmed by angiography, were diagnosed by CFDI. The data show that CFDI provides an accurate noninvasive technique for following up patients after excimer laser angioplasty, allowing for asymptomatic reocclusions to be recognized and treated if necessary, and permitting symptoms not due to reocclusions to be properly identified, thus avoiding unnecessary angiography.
