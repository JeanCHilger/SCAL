Transcranial Doppler: methodology and indications in 1993. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound is a new non-invasive method of exploration which through the use of low frequencies and transcranial windows is able to investigate the main vessels in the Willis polygon. It now has a variety of applications: diagnosis of stenoses and intracranial occlusions, assessment of the intracerebral impact of stenoses and occlusions of the internal carotid artery, monitoring of the middle cerebral artery in situations involving intensive care or carotid surgery, diagnosis of cerebral arteriovenous malformations, the diagnosis of brain death and the follow-up of secondary spasm due to meningeal hemorrhage. The combination of continuous Doppler and ultrasound scan with a transcranial Doppler scan is able to modify the indications for an arterial angiography, notably in cerebral ischemic disease. Its non-invasive nature and convenience will favor its future development for diagnostic purposes and, above all, for short-term monitoring or periodic long-term check-ups.
