The effect of elastic stockings on the elasticity of varicose veins. The aim of this study was to establish the long-term effect of graduated elastic compression on venous elasticity in patients with superficial or deep venous disease and to determine the possible relationship between elasticity and the duration of the disease. The elastic modulus of 29 patients, 19 with superficial vein incompetence and 10 with deep vein incompetence was assessed by the simultaneous measurement of calf volume (determined using strain gauge) and venous pressure (obtained via a dorsal foot vein) during venous occlusion. The measurements were obtained before and after 4 weeks of elastic compression stockings. The elastic modulus K, was defined as stress/strain when the veins were full and was calculated from the pressure/volume relationship. The results show a clear difference in elasticity before and after elastic stockings. Two groups of patients were identified: group 1 with increased elasticity and group 2 with decreased elasticity. There was a negative linear relationship (r = 0.88) between increase in elasticity after treatment and duration of venous disease.
