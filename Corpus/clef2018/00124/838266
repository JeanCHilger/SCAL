Venous flow studies by ultrasound prior and following vaginal hysterectomy (author's transl). The flow in the femoral veins was studied by systematic ultrasound examinations in 100 patients before and after vaginal hysterectomies. The following observations were made: 1. In the diagnosis of thrombosis the Valsalyamaneuver is important and preferable to an evaluation of the spontaneous flow with deeprespirations. 2. Postoperatively slight deterioration of the function of the walls of the veins and a slight increase in venous stasis due to impeded venous return is found. 3. The Doppler ultrasound examination does not appear to be efficient enough for routine use. 4. In cases with a history of thrombosis or clinical suspicion of thrombosis the Doppler examination should be used with a specific diagnostic question in mind. In these cases the diagnostic gap between clinical examination and phlebography can be closed by the Doppler examination.
