Renal artery stenosis secondary to neurofibromatosis in children: detection by Doppler ultrasound. Renal artery stenosis was diagnosed in two adolescents with neurofibromatosis using Doppler ultrasound. The diagnosis was confirmed by angiography. The renal vascular lesion in neurofibromatosis usually affects the proximal segment of the artery, which is the part most optimally visualized by ultrasound. We suggest that Doppler ultrasound of the renal arteries may be a useful technique in the investigation of hypertensive children with neurofibromatosis.
