The effect of pyridinolcarbamate after acute and chronic administration in patients with atherosclerosis obliterans. The study was aimed at evaluating the effect of pyridinolcarbamate in patients with atherosclerosis obliterans of the lower limbs. A single intravenous administration of the drug did not induce changes in resting blood flow, but elicited a significant decline in capillary filtration rate. In a double-blind cross-over trial patients reported a significant prolongation of walking distance after 6 months of pyridinolcarbamate treatment. Sensation of cold in the lower limbs was not affected. Pyridinolcarbamate did not influence peak values of blood flow through the calf but they appeared significantly earlier. No significant changes were seen at the evaluation of the elevation and dependency test and performance using tiptoeing test. Likewise the findings of systolic pressure in the lower limbs, pulse wave morphology, and claudication distance on treadmill did not confirm a therapeutic effect of pyridinolcarbamate.
