Pulmonary venodilation by isoflurane improves gas exchange during Escherichia coli bacteremia. To determine how isoflurance affects the longitudinal distribution of pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary gas exchange during Escherichia coli bacteremia.Prospective, controlled study with open-label assignment of animals to two groups.Laboratory.Goehingen minipigs.Induction of acute respiratory failure by a 4-hr infusion of live E. coli bacteria in 12 animals six animals anesthetized with methohexital/piritramideCardiac output and pressures were measured by means of an arterial catheter, Swan-Ganz catheter, and a left atrial catheter. Effective pulmonary capillary pressure was evaluated graphically from a pulmonary artery occlusion pressure decay. Arterial-alveolar PO2 ratio was calculated to evaluate pulmonary function. Measurements were performed before and after 1, 2, and 3.5 hrs of E. coli infusion. Statistical significance was tested with analysis of variance (ANOVA). E. coli infusion caused hypodynamic shock, an increase in pre- and postcapillary pulmonary vascular resistance and respiratory failure. Postcapillary pressure gradient and effective pulmonary capillary pressure were lower in the isoflurane-group. Methohexital-anesthetized animals developed pulmonary dysfunction after 1 hr of bacteremia, whereas isoflurane-anesthetized animals developed pulmonary dysfunction after 3.5 hrs of E. coli infusion (significantly different, ANOVA, p < .05). There were no significant changes in the sham group.Isoflurane is a pulmonary venodilator. During lethal E. coli infusion, it ameliorates the increase in pulmonary capillary pressure and preserves pulmonary function until vascular permeability increases.
