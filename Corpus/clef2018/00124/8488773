Coronary flow velocity dynamics in normal and diseased arteries. Distal coronary flow velocity measurements were previously limited to open heart or experimental procedures. Unlike previous Doppler catheter techniques, a Doppler angioplasty flow wire permits flow velocity measurements in both the proximal and distal segments of normal and diseased coronary arteries. In order to determine the potential clinical application of the Doppler flow wire, we performed baseline and hyperemia flow velocity measurements in proximal and distal segments of 20 angiographically normal arteries (right coronary = 8 left circumflex = 7
