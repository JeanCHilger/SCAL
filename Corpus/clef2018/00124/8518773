Pulsed Doppler echocardiography to assess pulmonary artery hypertension in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Noninvasive assessment of pulmonary artery hypertension would be of great value in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Although continuous wave Doppler echocardiographic measurement of right atrial to right ventricular pressure gradient is the most useful method of noninvasive assessment of pulmonary artery hypertension, this technique is often limited in patients with COPD. In order to evaluate the usefulness of pulsed Doppler echocardiography, for the estimation of pulmonary artery pressure in COPD patients in whom continuous wave Doppler ultrasound has failed, we compared right ventricular systolic time intervals: pre-ejection period (PEP, ms), acceleration time (AT, ms), right ventricular ejection time (RVET, ms), and AT/RVET and PEP/RVET ratios, as measured by pulmonary artery pulsed Doppler traces, in 30 COPD patients, with the time intervals of 15 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers, using the subcostal approach. In addition, right ventricular systolic time intervals of the COPD patients were correlated with invasive catheterization data (systolic and mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAPs and PAPm). AT and AT/RVET were significantly shorter in COPD patients (AT 92 +/- 4.3 ms AT/RVET 0.38 +/- 0.03) as compared with healthy volunteers (AT 132 +/- 4.5 ms
