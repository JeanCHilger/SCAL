Comparison between Doppler findings and arteriography in cervical arterial pathology. The authors compare findings at arteriography and Doppler ultrasound examination in 127 cases of cerebrovascular accident. There was an excellent degree of agreement in cases of internal carotid occlusion. It was less good with carotid stenoses where the Doppler examination gave false positive results in one case out of four and false negatives in one out of three. Thus the correlation between Doppler and arteriography results are not sufficiently cloe to completely change the attitude of the neurologist in the selection of those patients in whom arteriographic studies are indicated in order to detect a surgically curable lesion.
