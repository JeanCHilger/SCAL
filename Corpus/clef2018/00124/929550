Doppler ultrasound technique compared to angiography, intraoperative pressure gradients and blood flow measurements in carotid surgery (author's transl). Doppler ultrasound technique was used in 32 patients to differentiate between non-signigicant stenosis, significant stenosis and occlusion of the internal carotid artery. The results were then compared to angiographic findings and peroperative pressure gradients and blood flow measurements. The Doppler examinations showed good agreement with the angiograms. Pathologic Doppler results were positively correlated to a high pressure gradient but were not correlated to the internal carotid blood flow. Pre- and postoperatively the Doppler ultrasound examinations increased the diagnostic security, improved the assessment of the hemodynamic significance of a stenosis and made in some cases an angiogram unnecessary.
