High prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia and asymptomatic vascular disease in siblings of young patients with vascular disease and hyperhomocysteinemia. Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHC) is associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic vascular disease and may be inherited. Fasting and postmethionine HHC are independent risk factors that overlap to a limited extent. To study the familial occurrence of HHC, we investigated the prevalence of HHC (both fasting and after methionine) among 450 siblings of 167 consecutive young patients with vascular disease and postmethionine HHC. Furthermore, all subjects with postmethionine HHC (n = 125) were invited for noninvasive vascular testing 101 (80.8%) agreed. Of those with a normal postmethionine plasma level (n = 325), we randomly selected 73 subjects for further studies
