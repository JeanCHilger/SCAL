Occurrence of renal artery stenosis in patients with peripheral arteriosclerosis and hypertension. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of renal artery stenosis in patients with clinical signs of peripheral vascular disease and hypertension. One hundred patients, mean age 69 years (range 45-88) with symptoms and clinical signs of severe peripheral ischaemia, underwent aortography to determine the degree of peripheral vascular disease and possible renal artery stenosis. History of claudication and measurement of systolic distal blood pressure and calculation of the Ankle Brachial Index was used to define the severity of peripheral vascular disease. Thirty-one percent had renal artery stenosis (14% greater than 50% reduction in luminal diameter). In a subgroup of patients with hypertension and peripheral vascular disease (n = 74), 34% had renal artery stenosis. In the subgroup of patients with renal artery stenosis, 81% had hypertension. Among patients with renal artery stenosis and lumen reduction of more than 50%, 93% had hypertension (p < 0.001). In conclusion this study shows that the combination of peripheral vascular disease and hypertension is an important clinical clue for renovascular disease. Examination for renovascular disease in this population should be considered, since the prevalence of the condition is high. Furthermore, examination for renal vascular disease in this population is mandatory, before treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors is initiated, since treatment might lead to serious renal function impairment.
