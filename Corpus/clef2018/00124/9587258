Computed numerical analysis of the biomechanical effects on coronary atherogenesis using human hemodynamic and dimensional variables. The objectives of this investigation were to evaluate biomechanical factors in the atherosclerotic process using human in vivo hemodynamic parameters and computed numerical simulation qualitatively and quantitatively. The three-dimensional spatial patterns of steady and pulsatile flows in the left coronary artery were simulated, using a finite volume method. Coronary angiogram and Doppler ultrasound measurement of the proximal left coronary flow velocity were performed in humans. Inlet wave velocity distribution obtained from in vivo data of the intravascular Doppler study allowed for input of in vitro numerical simulation. Hemodynamic variables, such as flow velocity, pressure and shear stress of the left anterior descending coronary bifurcation site were calculated. We found that there were spatial fluctuation of flow-velocity and recirculation areas at the curved outer wall of the left anterior descending coronary artery, which were due to the differences of flow-velocity and shear stress, especially during the declaration phase of pulsatile flow. This study suggests that rheologic properties may be a part of the atherogenic process in the coronary bifurcated and curved areas.
