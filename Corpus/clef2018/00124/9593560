Noninvasive assessment of significant left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis by coronary flow velocity reserve with transthoracic color Doppler echocardiography. Coronary flow reserve has been considered an important diagnostic index of the functional significance of coronary artery stenosis. With Doppler technique, it has been assessed as the ratio of hyperemic to basal coronary flow velocity (coronary flow velocity reserve [CFVR]) by invasive or semiinvasive methods with a Doppler catheter, a Doppler guide wire, and a transesophageal Doppler echocardiographic probe. Recent technological advancement in transthoracic Doppler echocardiography (TTDE) provides measurement of coronary flow velocity in the distal portion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) and may be useful in the noninvasive CFVR measurement. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the value of CFVR determined by TTDE for the assessment of significant LAD stenosis.We studied 36 patients who underwent coronary angiography for the assessment of coronary artery disease. The study population consisted of 12 patients with significant LAD stenosis (group A) and 24 patients without significant LAD stenosis (group B). With TTDE, coronary flow velocities in the distal LAD were recorded at rest and during hyperemia induced by intravenous infusion of adenosine (0.14 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1)) under the guidance of color Doppler flow mapping. Adequate spectral Doppler recordings of coronary flow in the distal LAD for the assessment of CFVR were obtained in 34 of 36 study patients (94%). The peak and mean diastolic coronary flow velocities at baseline did not differ between groups A and B (23.6+/-10.3 versus 22.9+/-6.6 cm/s and 16.4+/-8.6 versus 14.5+/-4.0 cm/s, respectively). However, the peak and mean coronary flow velocities during hyperemia in group A were significantly smaller than those in group B (35.6+/-16.3 versus 54.2+/-16.3 cm/s and 24.7+/-13.1 versus 37.9+/-13.0 cm/s, respectively P<.01). There were significant differences in CFVR obtained from peak and mean diastolic velocity between groups A and B (1.5+/-0.2 versus 2.4+/-0.4 and 1.5+/-0.2 versus 2.6+/-0.4, respectivelyCFVR determined by TTDE is useful in the noninvasive assessment of significant stenotic lesion in the LAD.
