Noninavasive angiography for the diagnosis of carotid artery disease using Doppler ultrasound (carotid artery Doppler). To detect stenosis in the carotid artery with a bidirectional continuous-wave Doppler ultrasound device, the following noninvasive procedure, applied on 800 patients and compared with 249 angiograms of 186 patients, has proved to be about 90% reliable. Measurements of flow signals were taken over the terminal branches of the ophthalmic artery (supratrochlear and supraorbital arteries) and averaged. Compression of superficial temporal and facial arteries revealed flow direction and common carotid artery compression revealed the supplying blood vessel and the effectiveness of the circle of Willis. Measurements over the common carotid arteries were used to evaluate peripheral resistance. A set of eight criteria was used the diagnostic value of each criterion was calculated by comparing 138 pathological Doppler findings in 123 patients with the angiograms. If reverse flow direction in supratrochlear or supraorbital artery was used alone, only 43% correct diagnoses would have resulted. A more severe stenosis is not necessarily correlated with a more weighted criterion
