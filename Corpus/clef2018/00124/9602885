Psoriatic arthritis associated with dilated cardiomyopathy and Takayasu's arteritis. A 40-year-old Japanese man with psoriatic arthritis (PA) involving the spine, sacroiliac and peripheral joints presented with dyspnoea and ankle oedema. Blood pressure was 180/110 and 114/80 mmHg in the right and left upper arms, respectively. Examinations showed left ventricular dilatation and diffuse hypokinesis of the left ventricle, with no involvement of the coronary arteries. Aortography detected total occlusion of the left subclavian artery and stenosis of the origin at the right renal artery. Dilated cardiomyopathy and Takayasu's arteritis associated with PA was diagnosed. A few cases of PA have been reported in association with cardiovascular diseases, but the association of these three diseases has not been documented in the literature to date. Dermatologists need to be aware of cardiovascular manifestations in patients with PA, because cardiovascular diseases are not rare in other seronegative spondyloarthropathies.
