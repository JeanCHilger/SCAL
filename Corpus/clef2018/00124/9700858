Direct physical factors and PGI2 and TXA2 secretions by a human endothelial cell line: in vitro investigation of pressure and shear stress applied independently or in synergy. The direct effect of two types of mechanical stress was measured through the prostacyclin (PGI2) and thromboxane A2 (TXA2) secretions by a confluent monolayer of cells from the EA.hy926 line. Eight values of constant pressure were applied in the gas phase above the culture medium, around atmospheric pressure taken as a control (0 mm Hg), from -500 to +760 mm Hg. Three amplitudes of sinewave modulated pressure (+/- 40 +/- 80
