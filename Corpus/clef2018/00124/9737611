Peter B. Samuels Award. Restenosis after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Determine the feasibility of studying the natural history of the atherosclerotic plaque following percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), using duplex scanning.Twenty-three patients with 40 stenoses (>70% and <5 cm in length) in the iliac and femoro-popliteal segments were studied by duplex scanning before PTA, on day 1, weekly for 8 weeks, and at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. The following measurements were made: thickness of the plaque, minimal lumen diameter (MLD), and peak systolic velocity ratio (PSVR). A PSVR >2.0 was used to indicate >50% lumen diameter reduction.Thirty stenoses were available for measurement and analysis. Mean reduction in plaque thickness after angioplasty was greater in echolucent plaques (2.33 +/- 0.9 mm) than echogenic plaques (0.83 +/- 0.6 mm P < 0.0001). Successful angioplasty (PSVR <2.0) and increase in MLD in echolucent plaques was the result of plaque compressionDuplex scanning provides valuable information on both luminal diameter and plaque thickness it may be used to study the natural history of plaques following angioplasty and also the effects of therapeutic agents aimed at reducing restenosis.
