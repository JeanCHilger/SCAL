Lacunar infarcts defined by magnetic resonance imaging of 3660 elderly people: the Cardiovascular Health Study. To identify risk factors for and functional consequences of lacunar infarct in elderly people.The Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) is a longitudinal study of people 65 years or older, in which 3660 participants underwent cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Neuroradiologists read scans in a standard fashion without any clinical information. Lacunes were defined as subcortical areas consistent with infarcts measuring 3 to 20 mm. In cross-sectional analyses, clinical correlates were contrasted among groups defined by MRI findings.Of the 3660 subjects who underwent MRI, 2529 (69%) were free of infarcts of any kind and 841 (23%) had 1 or more lacunes without other types present, totaling 1270 lacunes. For most of these 841 subjects, their lacunes were single (66%) and silent (89%), namely without a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke. In multivariate analyses, factors independently associated with lacunes were increased age, diastolic blood pressure, creatinine, and pack-years of smoking (listed in descending order of strength of association for all, P < .005), as well as maximum internal carotid artery stenosis of more than 50% (odds ratio [OR], 1.81In this group of older adults, lacunes defined by MRI are common and associated with factors that likely promote or reflect small-vessel disease. Silent lacunes are also associated with neurologic dysfunction.
