Pseudoaneurysm after penetrating trauma in children and adolescents. Although skin lacerations are common in children and adolescents, the complication of pseudoaneurysm (PA) has rarely been reported.The author reports a series of four cases of patients in whom PA developed after lacerations. The diagnosis was made on the basis of the history and clinical findings in all cases. Doppler ultrasound confirmed the diagnosis in two cases. Resection of the aneurysm was the treatment in each.Each of the patients had successful removal of his lesion. One patient with a radial artery PA underwent resection without reconstruction he remains free of claudication and has symmetrical upper extremities.Pseudoaneurysms are uncommon sequella of lacerations. In children, resection is satisfactory treatment when adequate collateral flow can be demonstrated.
