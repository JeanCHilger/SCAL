Endovascular stent grafts for aneurysmal and occlusive vascular disease. This report details our initial experience with two types of endovascular grafts- one for the treatment of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms and the other for the treatment of iliac artery occlusive disease.An abdominal aortic aneurysm was repaired in 34 patients using 3 different types of Ancure endografts (Menlo Park, California). Control patients (n = 9) had a standard aneurysm repair. Patients with chronic lower extremity ischemia (n = 7) secondary to iliac artery occlusive disease were treated with a Hemobahn endograft (W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Arizona).Ancure graft deployment was achieved in 33 of 34 (97.1%) patients. Perioperative mortality for the Ancure and control group patients was 2.9% and 0%, respectively. Periprosthetic leaks were identified within 48 hours of deployment in 6 (18.2%) Ancure graft patients. All but 2 of the leaks resolved on serial follow-up. Additional endovascular procedures were required in 11 (32.4%) Ancure graft patients at the initial procedure or during follow-up to correct graft or arterial stenoses. Patients treated with an endovascular graft had significantly less blood loss and shorter hospital stays than control group patients. For Hemobahn patients, the technical success for graft deployment was 100%. There were no perioperative deaths. The ankle/brachial index increased from a mean of 0.52 preoperatively to 0.86 postoperatively (P = 0.004). One patient required a Wallstent in follow-up to correct a graft wrinkle. Angiography at 6 months demonstrated mild intimal hyperplasia in the stent graft in 5 of 6 patients.These early results support the potential for endovascular grafts in the treatment of aneurysmal and occlusive vascular disease. Further modifications in the devices and deployment techniques are necessary to reduce the incidence of periprosthetic leaks, graft limb stenoses, and intimal hyperplasia.
