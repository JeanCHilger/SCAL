Chronic obliterative arterial disease of the lower limbs in the coronary patient: prevalence and prognostic incidence. The Monica Toulouse register. This study was aimed at evaluating the prevalence of peripheral arterial disease of the lower extremities and its prognostic value in a population of patients from the Haute-Garonne department, who were hospitalized for acute coronary artery disease.Between 1985 and 1991, four thousands three hundred and sixty-eight patients (3,680 males and 688 females) presenting with acute coronary artery disease were included in the study.The prevalence of peripheral arterial disease of the lower extremities was 13.4%, increasing with age and being higher in male patients. In regard to patients hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction (n = 2,417), independent relationships were observed between the 28-day mortality and the following: patient's age (odds ratio: 1.02 95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.04The prevalence of peripheral arterial disease of the lower extremities is high in patients with acute coronary artery disease in both genders, whatever the age. This disease is therefore an independent marker of mortality for acute myocardial infarction. Easy diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease of the lower limbs by measurement of the ankle pressure index allows identification of patients prone to death from acute myocardial infarction.
