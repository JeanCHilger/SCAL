Vein graft surveillance with scanhead tracking duplex ultrasound imaging: a preliminary report. A severe arterial occlusion in the leg usually is bypassed by implanting a saphenous vein harvested from the limb. Once implanted, the vein functions well but over time may develop stenoses that may lead to occlusion. In order to detect and correct the stenoses that may lead to graft failure, frequent surveillance of the vein graft is required. A new ultrasound imaging method was developed to display the panoramic view of the vein graft in combination with its blood flow velocity waveform for surveillance. The panoramic view is the projection (ray-casting) image of multiple B-mode images with sequential longitudinal view of the vein graft. The velocity waveform also is recorded along the vessel with pulsed Doppler ultrasound. The acquired images and waveforms from the ultrasound scanner are registered individually in three-dimensional space with an electromagnet-based position and orientation sensor located on the scanhead. A prominent point on the scar from the surgery is used as the fiducial mark for spatial registration, so that the same lesion in the vein graft can be tracked automatically at each visit for retrospective study.
