Control of cutaneous blood vessels in psoriatic plaques. The aim of this study was to compare local blood flow in psoriatic plaques before and after provocations known to alter cutaneous vascular resistance, in order to determine whether plaque hyperemia is caused by a failure of normal vascular control mechanisms. Cutaneous blood flow was recorded using a laser Doppler flowmeter over plaque skin (plaque site) and clinically normal skin (nonplaque site) on the opposite arm, at least 5 cm away from the nearest plaque. It is important to note that most of the laser Doppler signal comes from the subpapillary plexus of the skin and only a small portion (2%-10%) is produced by capillary blood flow. In the psoriatic plaques the basal flux was between nine and 13 times greater than nonplaque skin. The biologic zero (a signal independent of perfusion, which also persists after complete proximal arterial occlusion) was also significantly greater at plaque sites compared with nonplaque sites. Sympathetic and local vasoconstriction in psoriatic skin was shown to be intact and responses to vasodilator tests were likewise intact, i.e., there was no failure of response to normal vascular control mechanisms, albeit some quantitative differences. Tests of vasodilatation indicated that, although basal flux is high in plaque compared with nonplaque skin, arterioles supplying plaque skin can dilate further, i.e., lesional arterioles are not normally maximally dilated but have a basal constrictor tone. Interestingly, the red cell flux at maximum dilatation in nonplaque skin is less than even the basal flux in plaque skin. This means that in plaque skin either there are more arterioles than in nonplaque skin, or there is chronic, structural widening of the existing arterioles in plaque skin.
