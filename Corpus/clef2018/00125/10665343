Pediatric extracranial applications of MR angiography. Extracranial magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) was performed in 20 children to evaluate for various arterial and venous conditions. Time-of-flight and phase-contrast angiograms were constructed using a maximal-intensity-projection algorithm. The accuracy of MRA was comparable to Doppler ultrasound (n = 12) and conventional angiography (n = 3). MRA could provide an excellent mapping of patent (including collaterals) versus thrombosed vessels at sites not evaluated or inaccessible by sonography. Limitations included assessment of small and/or tortuous vessels, severely stenotic lesions, and very slow flow.
