Beneficial effects of the T- and L-type calcium channel antagonist, mibefradil, against exercise-induced myocardial stunning in dogs. Abnormalities in calcium homeostasis such as calcium overload have been shown to participate in the pathogenesis of myocardial stunning. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of mibefradil, a mixed T- and L-type calcium channels antagonist on exercise-induced ischemia (i.e., high-flow ischemia). Nine dogs were permanently instrumented to measure left ventricular wall thickening (Wth) and coronary blood flow (Doppler). Infusion of saline or mibefradil (30 and 40 microg/kg/min, i.v., for 20 min) was started 10 min before exercise (10 min, 14 km/h slope, 13%) and stopped at its end. Circumflex coronary artery stenosis (pneumatic occluders) was set up 5 min before exercise to suppress exercise-induced increase in mean coronary blood flow without simultaneously affecting Wth at rest. Mibefradil (30 microg/kg/min) was also administered at the beginning of the recovery period in a subset of four dogs. During exercise with saline, Wth was dramatically reduced (-77 +/- 7%
