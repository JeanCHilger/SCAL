Effects of cortical spreading depression on cortical blood flow, impedance, DC potential, and infarct size in a rat venous infarct model. A cortical venous infarction model has been evaluated as to the degree of regional flow reduction and by studying effects of cortical spreading depression (CSD). Two adjacent cortical veins were occluded photochemically with rose bengal and fiberoptic illumination. Seven rats served to demonstrate effects on regional cortical blood flow using laser Doppler scanning. In 36 rats local CBF, DC potential, and brain tissue impedance were measured continuously for 75 min after vein occlusion. No, 3, or 10 CSD waves were induced by potassium chloride injection during the initial 75 min. Rats were compared for spontaneous CSDs baseline local CBF, CBF, and impedance response to CSD
