Vessel wall alterations in patients with renal failure. Cardiovascular complications are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with renal failure. Death due to myocardial infarction and to stroke is more frequent in hemodialysis patients than in the total population. These cardiovascular diseases are mainly the consequence of atherosclerosis and cause decreased life expectancy in patients with renal failure. Ultrasound techniques now make it possible to measure atherosclerotic lesions in big and medium-sized arteries. Thickening of the intima-media-complex is an early sign of atherosclerosis in these vessels. It reduces the distensibility of the arteries during systole. The distensibility of big and medium-sized arteries can be determined using ultrasound-doppler-techniques. In our studies, the intima-media-thickness of the carotid artery was significantly (p< 0.01) increased in patients with chronic renal failure (1.32+/-0.49 mm, n=28) as compared with aged-matched healthy control subjects (0.75 +/- 0.20, n= 29). The distensibility coefficient was higher (p< 0.05) in healthy controls (26 +/- 1.8 10(-3)/kPa, n= 12) than in patients with renal insufficiency (19 +/- 1.7 10(-3)/kPa, n = 12). This demonstrates increased stiffness of the vessel wall resulting in loss of Windkessel function and increased work load of the heart.
