The significance of atherogenic indices in patients on hemodialysis. Atherosclerotic diseases (ASD) are the major cause of mortality and morbidity in patients on hemodialysis (HD). To evaluate the significance and usefulness of atherogenic indices, we examined lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)), remnant-like particles cholesterol (RLP.C), homocysteine (Hcy), cardiac troponin T (TnT), and ankle-arm blood pressure index (AABI) in 114 patients on HD (male 79, female 35 age 62.1 +/- 1.3 years). As a result, serum cardiac TnT and AABI levels in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) (n = 33) were significantly higher than those in patients without DM (n = 81). In patients with cerebrovascular diseases (CVD), serum levels of both RLP.C and Hcy, and AABI levels were significantly higher than those in patients without CVD. In patients with coronary artery diseases (CAD), serum cardiac TnT and AABI levels were significantly higher than those in patients without CAD. In patients with peripheral vascular diseases (PVD), serum levels of both Hcy and cardiac TnT were significantly higher than those in patients without PVD. Multiple regression analysis did show that the presence of DM, serum Hcy levels and age were independent factors as- sociated with ASD: ASD = -0.348 + 0.426 x DM (scored: 0, absence
