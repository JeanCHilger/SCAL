Balloon dilation and stenting of chronic iliac vein obstruction: technical aspects and early clinical outcome. To describe the technical aspects of percutaneous balloon dilation and stenting for the treatment of venous outflow obstruction in chronic venous insufficiency.Between March 1997 and December 1998, 94 consecutive patients (median age 48 years, range 14 to 80) with suspected iliac vein obstruction in 102 limbs were studied prospectively with the intent to treat any venous occlusion or stenosis verified during femoral vein cannulation. Data from the history, clinical examination, procedure, and follow-up were recorded. Preoperative indicators of obstruction were venographic evidence of occlusion, stenosis, or pelvic collateral vessels increased arm-foot venous pressure differentialCannulation and technical success rates were 98% and 97%, respectively, with 118 Wallstents deployed in 77 veins. Primary, assisted primary, and secondary patency rates at 1 year were 82%, 91%, and 92%, respectively. Clinical improvement in pain and swelling was significant.Stenting of benign iliac vein obstruction is a safe method with good short-term results. Venous lesions should always be stented when treating iliocaval junction lesions, stents should be inserted well into the inferior vena cava. Absence of collateral vessels does not exclude the existence of significant obstruction, and their presence may indicate an obstruction not visualized. No gold standard for accurate pre- or intraoperative patient selection is currently available.
