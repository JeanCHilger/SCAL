Pseudoaneurysm of the pediatric popliteal artery after arthroscopic meniscus resection. Arterial injuries following arthroscopic procedures are extremely rare, but may have dramatic consequences without early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. We report a case of popliteal artery pseudo-aneurysm a following arthroscopic meniscectomy in a child. Non-invasive diagnostic workup included Doppler flow color imaging and computed tomography with contrast and 3D workup. The arterial lesion was repaired surgically by an posterior approach using a vein patch plasty. The popliteal artery is in close relationship to the posterior capsule of the knee joint. During knee flexion the vessel is positioned forward and placed even closer to the horn of the lateral meniscus. For this reason arthroscopic surgical manipulation in the posterior aspects of the knee joint must be performed under direct visualization. Indistinct swelling in the popliteal fossa and calf following arthroscopic surgery should arouse suspicion of an arterial injury.
