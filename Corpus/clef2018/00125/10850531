Magnetic resonance coronary angiography in patients with ischemic heart disease: analysis of coronary arterial blood flow velocity pattern. Only a few reports evaluating coronary arterial blood flow velocity patterns using magnetic resonance (MR) coronary angiography have appeared to date. This study reports an evaluation of coronary arterial blood flow velocity patterns in patients with ischemic heart disease and in healthy subjects using MR coronary angiography. The subjects consisted of 20 patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD group) and 20 normal healthy subjects (N group). Using the fCARD PC method, ECG-gated MR coronary angiography was performed using an anteroposterior opposing phased array coil. Regions of interest were placed on bilateral coronary arteries to measure coronary arterial blood flow velocity patterns. The IHD group was divided into two subgroups, based on the presence (MI group) or absence (AP group) of infarcted myocardium using 99m Tc-methoxyisobutylisonitrile (MIBI) myocardial scintigraphy. Average diastolic peak velocity (ADPV) was lower in the IHD group than in the N group. In addition, the diastolic / systolic velocity ratio (DSVR) was significantly lower in the MI group. Moreover, in the AP group, both the ADPV and DSVR values were significantly increased in those who had undergone percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty postoperatively. Different from the Doppler guidewire method, MR coronary angiography facilitates noninvasive evaluation of coronary arterial blood flow velocity. Therefore, these results indicate that MR coronary angiography represents a potentially useful technique for diagnosing lesions of coronary arteries and evaluating their functions. This noninvasive method can be expected to replace the invasive Doppler guidewire method in the near future with development of MR coronary angiography technology.
