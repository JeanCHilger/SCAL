Validity of the clinical prediction rule for the diagnosis of renal arterial stenosis in hypertensive patients resistant to treatment. To perform an external validation of the clinical prediction rule established by Krijnen et al. (Ann Intern Med 1998 129: 705-11) designed to identify renal artery stenoses (RAS) in hypertensive patients.We included 102 patients with a refractory hypertension treated with at least two antihypertensive drugs. All subjects had the research of RAS by renal angiography, or angio-computed tomography, or doppler ultrasound. Probability to detect RAS was calculated with Krijnen's algorithm (Pre-test probability) from the following parameters: age, smoking status, diffuse atherosclerosis, recent hypertension (< 2 y), obesity (BMI > 25), abdominal bruit, hypercholesterolemia (> 6.5 mmol/L), creatinine. ROC curves were plotted for each pre-test probability value. A "post-test probability" was obtained from the likelihood ratio calculated at each pre-test probability level.RAS prevalence in this population was 49%. Area under the ROC curve was 0.79 and Youden index was maximal for a pre-test probability of 15%. Maximal likelihood ratio was obtained for a pre-test probability of 46%. Table shows post-test probability as a function of pre-test probability obtained with Krijnen's algorithm. [table: see text]Krijnen's algorithm is valid in a population of resistant hypertensives treated with a bi-therapy. This external validation obtained on a population with a high prevalence of RAS should also be tested on a population with a lower prevalence of SAR.
