Technical dilemma in living-donor or split-liver transplant. In partial liver transplantation for adults criteria for the extent of reconstruction of middle hepatic vein tributaries have not been clarified. After hepatic venous and portal anastomoses in living-donor liver transplantation using left liver graft without middle hepatic vein, color Doppler ultrasonography was applied to check venous and portal blood flow. Color Doppler ultrasonography demonstrated absent hepatic venous flow and reversed portal venous flow in the congested area of the left paramedian sector which had been drained by the divided branch of the middle hepatic vein. The area was darkly discolored before arterial reperfusion and under clamping of the artery. Reconstruction of the venous branch was added after arterial anastomosis. Color Doppler ultrasonography revealed restored normal venous outflow and portal inflow after venous reconstruction. Postoperative course of the recipient was uneventful with rapid recovery of liver function. We propose that middle hepatic vein tributaries should be reconstructed if color Doppler ultrasonography demonstrates absent venous flow and reversed portal flow, and if the liver volume excluding the discolored area under occlusion of the hepatic artery is estimated to be insufficient for postoperative metabolic demand.
