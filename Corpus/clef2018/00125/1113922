Coronary cardiopathy. Results obtained with selective coronariography, ventriculography, left catheterisation and the measurement of systolic times were compared in a series of 110 patients.  Evaluation of vascular alterations with the aid of a coronary index showed that their entity was closely related to the incidence of asynergia and the extent to which left ventricular function was compromised.  Index values were proportional to decrease of the DP/DT ratio, increased telediastolic pressure, lengthening of the pre-ejection phases and shortening of left ventricular systole.  The physiopathological and clinical significance of these results is discussed.
