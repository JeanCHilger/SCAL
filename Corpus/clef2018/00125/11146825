Noise field findings in 24 patients with coronary heart disease. In earlier studies it was shown that patients with vascular disturbances (e.g. sudden hearing loss) had white-noise field campimetry abnormalities despite normal visual fields. The aim of this study was to clarify whether patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) have such disturbances in the white-noise field campimetry, too.Twenty-four patients (m:f = 23:1 mean age 58 +/- 9 years) with an angiographically documented CHD and 30 healthy controls (m:f = 29:1Fifteen patients had had a cardiac infarction. Twenty-one patients, but only 6 controls had alterations in perilimbal vessels of the conjunctiva and sixteen patients had a tortuousity of retinal vessels. The visual acuity, the intraocular pressure, the cup/disc ratio and the visual fields were within normal ranges. However, twenty patients and 5 controls were abnormal in the white-noise field campimetry.Although patients with CHD appeared unaffected in the standard eye examinations, the disturbances in the white-noise field campimetry indicated a functional visual impairment. Together with the changes in the perilimbal vessels of the conjunctiva and the retinal vessels, a disturbed ocular microcirculation as the underlaying cause could be discussed.
