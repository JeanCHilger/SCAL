The Legs for Life screening for peripheral vascular disease: compliance with physician recommendations in moderate- and high-risk assessed patients. To determine compliance within a community with recommendations made by physicians during the 1999 Legs for Life National Screening for Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD) and Leg Pain.Patients were initially screened for PVD by completion of the Legs for Life risk factor questionnaire and determination of bilateral ankle/brachial indexes (ABIs). Each patient subsequently met with an interventional radiologist or vascular surgeon. Patients with normal ABIs (>1.0 bilaterally) or mildly abnormal ABI(s) (<1.0 but >0.90) were classified at no and low risk for PVD, respectively patients with ABI(s) of 0.70-0.89 were classified at moderate risk for PVDA total of 205 patients were screened for PVD, 48 (23%) of whom were determined to be at moderate to high risk. Forty-four (92%) patients were available for follow-up. At 7 months after screening, 31 (70%) patients had received no further medical advice or treatment. Thirteen (30%) of these patients had completed a follow-up appointment, but only three with a physician specializing in peripheral vascular disease. None of the patients had clinical follow-up with an interventional radiologist. Five (11%) patients had undergone noninvasive Doppler evaluation and one (2%) had undergone diagnostic arteriography. No patient had undergone any form of percutaneous or surgical intervention.Patient compliance with physician recommendations after outpatient screening for PVD is low. The Legs for Life screening program could be considered successful in that it provides for patient education and the identification of moderate to high-risk patients. Physicians participating in this program may have to modify their approach to patient screening and follow-up if a concomitant goal is to deliver specialty care.
