Systolic slope and other pressure measurements in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Measurements of systolic blood pressure at the ankle are of proved value for quantitating the severity of peripheral arterial disease. Preliminary results indicate that the measurements of the rate of rise of arterial pressure at the ankle divided by the pulse pressure in the arm is a much more sensitive measurement and is capable of detecting minor degrees of arterial stenosis.
