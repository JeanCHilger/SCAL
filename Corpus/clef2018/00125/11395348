Giant cell arteritis presenting with arm claudication. A 72-year-old woman presented after a series of falls with a history of malaise, lethargy, cold hands and arm weakness for several months. She had undergone extensive investigation for what remained an unexplained anaemia during this period. Examination revealed cold hands with absent radial pulses. Axillary Doppler studies confirmed grossly diminished systolic pressures. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was markedly elevated. An arch aortogram showed obliterative changes selectively affecting the subclavian and axillary arteries. In spite of clinically normal temporal arteries, and the absence of headache, temporal artery biopsy revealed giant cell arteritis.Aortic arch syndrome is an important but under-appreciated complication of giant cell arteritis and may be the presenting feature. In this case, it resulted in falls consequent upon arm claudication when using a walking frame.
