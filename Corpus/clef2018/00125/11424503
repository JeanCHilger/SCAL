A case of thrombosed St. Jude Medical valve 16 years after initial mitral valve replacement. We report successful surgery for a thrombosed St. Jude Medical (SJM) valve 16 years after the initial mitral valve replacement even under conditions of satisfactory anticoagulation therapy. A 61-year-old-female had intermittent claudication and was admitted to our hospital for examination. The prosthetic valve sounds were normal to auscultation and the left ankle-pressure index was decreased to 0.6. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed no mitral regurgitation and a mean mitral valve gradient of 6-7 mmHg. Furthermore, transesophageal echocardiography revealed that one of the leaflets of the prosthetic valve was entirely immobilized at the closing position and a mobile soft tissue mass, 5 mm in diameter, was detected at the atrial side of the obstructed leaflet. Although 96,0000 IU of urokinase was administered intravenously for a week, we could not confirm any change in leaflet mobility. At the time of surgery, the posterior leaflet of the SJM valve, which was implanted at an anatomical orientation, was obstructed at the closing position with old and fresh thrombi. We decided upon replacement with a CarboMedics 29 M prosthetic valve. Postoperative medication consisted of warfarin plus low-dose aspirin. Generally, valve thrombosis occurs within 5 years after valve replacement. However, valve thrombosis is possible even in a reliable SJM valve and as long as 16 years after replacement. Therefore, the implantation of an SJM valve at an anti-anatomical orientation might lower the incidence of valve thrombosis in addition to life-long anticoagulation therapy.
