The effect of antihypertensive drugs on vascular compliance. Measurement of vascular compliance has assumed increasing importance as a marker of early disease of the vascular wall, a predictor of future vascular disease, and a way to monitor the effects of vasoactive agents on arterial wall stiffness. Vascular compliance can be estimated by several methods: measurement of the pulse pressure, or pulse pressure-stroke volume ratio analysis of the systolic pulse wave augmentation index and the diastolic pulse wave contour
