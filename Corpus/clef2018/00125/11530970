The Minnesota Regional Peripheral Arterial Disease Screening Program: toward a definition of community standards of care. The Minnesota Regional Peripheral Arterial Disease Screening Program was designed to define the efficacy of community PAD detection efforts, to assess the disease-specific and health-related morbidity, to assess PAD awareness rates, and to determine the magnitude of atherosclerosis disease risk factors and the intensity of their management. The target population was recruited via mass media efforts directed at individuals over 50 years of age and those with leg pain with ambulation. Screening sessions included assessments of the ankle-brachial index, blood pressure, fasting lipid profile, and use of validated tools to detect symptomatic claudication (by the Modified WHO-Edinburgh Claudication Questionnaire), walking impairment (Walking Impairment Questionnaire - WIQ), quality of life (MOS SF-36), PAD awareness, and the intensity of PAD medical therapeutic interventions. PAD was defined as any ankle-brachial index < or =0.85 or a history of lower extremity revascularization. The program evaluated 347 individuals and identified 92 subjects with PAD and 255 subjects without PAD, yielding a detection rate of 26.5%. Individuals with PAD were older, tended to have higher blood pressures, and had a significant walking impairment and an impaired health-related quality of life compared with the non-PAD subjects. Current rates of tobacco use were low. Lipid-lowering, estrogen replacement, anti-platelet, and antihypertensive medications and exercise therapies were underutilized in the PAD cohort. Peripheral arterial disease awareness was low in these community-identified patients. This Program demonstrated that individuals with PAD can be efficiently identified within the community, but that current standards of medical care are low. These data can assist in the future development of PAD awareness, education, and treatment programs.
