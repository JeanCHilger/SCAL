Orthostasis fails to produce active limb venoconstriction in adolescents. Orthostasis is characterized by translocation of blood from the upper body and thorax into dependent venous structures. Although active splanchnic venoconstriction is known to occur, active limb venoconstriction remains controversial. Based on prior work, we initially hypothesized that active venoconstriction does occur in the extremities during orthostasis in response to baroreflex activation. We investigated this hypothesis in the arms and legs of 11 healthy volunteers, aged 13-19 yr, using venous occlusion strain gauge plethysmography to obtain the forearm and calf blood flows and to compute the capacitance vessel volume-pressure compliance relation. Subjects were studied supine and at -10, +20, and +35 degrees to load the baroreflexes. With +20 degrees of tilt, blood flow decreased and limb arterial resistance increased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with supine. With +35 degrees of tilt, blood flow decreased, limb arterial resistance increased, and heart rate increased, indicating parasympathetic withdrawal and sympathetic activation with arterial vasoconstriction. The volume-pressure relation was unchanged by orthostatic maneuvers. The results suggest that active venoconstriction in the limbs is not important to mild orthostatic response.
