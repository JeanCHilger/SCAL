Techniques for predicting a favourable response to renal angioplasty in patients with renovascular disease. Renovascular disease is present in some 10-40% of patients with end-stage renal disease, and constitutes the fastest-growing group of end-stage renal disease patients. The unselective correction of renal artery stenosis has led to disappointing results. Most studies that compared conservative treatment with angioplasty found only modest or no beneficial effects of angioplasty on renal function and blood pressure. It is therefore mandatory to evaluate the functional significance of a stenosis before intervention. Patients with a high likelihood of a favourable response should be identified. Factors that affect outcome include the severity of renal artery stenosis, the procedure used to treat renal artery stenosis (antihypertensive drugs, angioplasty with or without stenting, or surgery), radiocontrast nephrotoxicity, atheroembolism and, most importantly, underlying renal disease, forestalling a favourable response of renal function or blood pressure even after the successful correction of renal artery stenosis. Evaluation of the renal resistance index using Doppler ultrasound or captopril scintigraphy are the best methods by which to classify patients as responders or non-responders to intervention. Each factor has to be considered before the correction of renal artery stenosis to achieve satisfactory results with regard to an improvement in renal function and blood pressure.
