Arteriogenesis and angiogenesis in rat ischemic hindlimb: role of nitric oxide. Nitric oxide (NO) has been implicated in both collateral expansion (arteriogenesis) and capillary growth (angiogenesis). Exercise training increases collateral-dependent blood flow to tissues at risk of ischemia and enhances capillarity in active skeletal muscle. Exercise also acutely elevates NO. Thus we assessed the role of NO in training-induced arteriogenesis and angiogenesis. These studies utilized a rat model of peripheral vascular disease (bilateral femoral artery ligation). Untreated rats (control) and rats treated with the NO synthase inhibitor N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME 65-70 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1), via drinking water) were divided into sedentary or exercise-trained subgroups. After approximately 3 wk, L-NAME treatment had elevated preexercise mean arterial pressure approximately 39-58%, confirming NO synthesis inhibition. The training program (treadmill exercise twice per day, 20-25 m/min, 15% grade, approximately 18 days) increased collateral-dependent blood flow to the distal hindlimb, with the greatest increase (approximately 59%) in the calf (P < 0.001). This increase was inhibited by L-NAME. In contrast, the training-induced increase in muscle capillarity was not blocked by L-NAME. Thus arteriogenesis and angiogenesis appear to differ in their requirement for NO.
