Increased arterial wall stiffness limits flow volume in the lower extremities in type 2 diabetic patients. To document an association between arterial wall stiffness and reduced flow volume in the lower-extremity arteries of diabetic patients.We recruited 60 consecutive type 2 diabetic patients who had no history or symptoms of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in the lower extremities and normal ankle/brachial systolic blood pressure index at the time of the study (non-PAD group) and 20 age-matched nondiabetic subjects (control group). We used an automatic device to measure pulse wave velocity (PWV) in the lower extremities as an index of arterial wall stiffness. At the popliteal artery, we evaluated flow volume and the resistive index as an index of arterial resistance to blood flow using gated two-dimensional cine-mode phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging.Consistent with previous reports, we confirmed that the non-PAD group had an abnormally higher PWV compared with that of the control group (P < 0.001). To further demonstrate decreased flow volume and abnormal flow pattern at the popliteal artery in patients with a higher degree of arterial wall stiffness, we assigned the 60 non-PAD patients to tertiles based on their levels of PWV. In the highest group, magnetic resonance angiograms of the calf and foot arteries showed decreased intravascular signal intensity, indicating the decreased arterial inflow in those arteries. The highest group was also characterized by the lowest late diastolic and total flow volumes as well as the highest resistive index among the groups. From stepwise multiple regression analysis, PWV and autonomic function were identified as independent determinants for late diastolic flow volume (r(2) = 0.300 P < 0.001).Arterial wall stiffness was associated with reduced arterial flow volume in the lower extremities of diabetic patients.
