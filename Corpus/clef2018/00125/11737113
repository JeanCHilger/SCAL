Analysis of portal venous waveform after living-related liver transplantation with pulsed Doppler ultrasound. We evaluate the portal venous waveform (PVW) with pulsed Doppler ultrasound (US) after living-related liver transplantation (LRLT) and correlate it with subsequent abnormalities. In the first 2 wk after LRLT, pulsed Doppler US demonstrated three types of PV waveform (PVW) in 33 recipients: non-phasic PVW in 19 patients, pulsatile in 10, and turbulent in 4. In the pulsatile PVW group, arterio-portal (A-P) shunt was confirmed in three grafts by either arteriograhy or computed tomography during hepatic arteriography. A severe stenosis in the grafted vein was confirmed in one case by both US and venography. The pulsatile PVW in the remaining six cases spontaneously disappeared and turned to the non-phasic PVW without treatment. The graft volume/liver standard volume (GV/SV) ratio was significantly smaller in the pulsatile PV waveform group than in the non-phasic PVW group (p<0.01). In the turbulent PVW group, aneurysmal-like dilatation of the portal vein at the umbilical portion was formed in 3 of the 4 patients. The pulsatile waveform in the PV is frequently observed with pulsed Doppler after LRLT, especially in patients that received small grafts. We should keep in mind that they often disappear without any treatment, although some examples of pulsatile waveforms represent vascular complications.
