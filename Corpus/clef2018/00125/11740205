Increased susceptibility to ischemic brain injury in cyclooxygenase-1-deficient mice. Cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), a rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of prostanoids, is involved in selected vasodilatatory responses of the cerebral circulation. Cyclooxygenase-1-null mice were used to determine whether COX-1 influences cerebral ischemic damage. The middle cerebral artery was occluded in COX-1 -/- and +/+ mice (n = 9/group), and lesion volume was determined in thionin-stained sections 24 or 96 hours later. Middle cerebral artery occlusion produced larger infarcts in COX-1 -/- mice, both at 24 (35 +/- 17% P < 0.05) and 96 hours (41 +/- 16%
