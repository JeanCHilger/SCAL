Incidence of carotid stenosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients after radiotherapy. Radiation-induced carotid stenosis in patients with head and neck tumors can cause significant mortality and morbidity. This study examined the incidence of stenosis in the extracranial carotid arteries of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients after radiotherapy.The extracranial carotid arteries of 71 (53 male and 18 female mean age of 53.6 years) postradiation patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma were examined with color Doppler ultrasound. The distribution of the arterial stenosis and the degree of stenosis were documented. The results were compared with the control group, which comprised 51 newly diagnosed nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients (35 male and 16 female, mean age of 48.8 years) before radiotherapy. Incidences of risk factors for arterial stenosis such as hypertension, smoking, and hypercholesterolemia also were studied in these two groups.There was no significant difference in the incidence of risk factors between the two groups. Arterial stenosis was, however, more common in the postradiation group than the preradiation group (56 of 71 vs. 11 of 51). The common/internal carotid arteries (CCA/ICA) were most commonly involved (55 of 71 vs. 11 of 51 P < 0.01), followed by the external carotid artery (ECA) (32 of 71 vs. 1 of 51This study showed that radiation could cause significant carotid stenosis. Ultrasound examinations for these patients therefore are necessary for early detection and possible intervention of this late radiation-induced complication.
