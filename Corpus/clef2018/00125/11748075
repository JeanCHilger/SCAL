Prior exercise training produces NO-dependent increases in collateral blood flow after acute arterial occlusion. We previously reported that prior training improves collateral blood flow (BF) to the calf muscles after acute-onset occlusion of the femoral artery (Yang HT et al. Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol 279: H1890-H1897, 2000). The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that increased release of nitric oxide (NO) by NO synthase (likely endothelial NOS) contributes to the increased BF to calf muscles of trained rats after acute femoral artery occlusion. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (~325 g) were limited to cage activity and were sedentary (SED n = 28) or exercise trained (TR
