Treatment of intermittent claudication with pentoxifylline: a 12-month, randomized trial--walking distance and microcirculation. The efficacy, safety and cost of pentoxifylline (PXF) in severe intermittent claudication was studied comparing PXF and placebo in a 12-month study. A treadmill test and microcirculatory evaluation with laser Doppler flowmetry were performed at inclusion and at the end of 6 and 12 months. A physical training plan (based on walking) and reduction in risk factor levels plan was used in both groups. Of the 120 included patients, 101 completed the study: 56 in the PXF group and 45 in the placebo group. There were 19 dropouts (due to low compliance). The two groups were comparable for age, sex distribution, walking distance, and the presence of risk factors and smoking. Intention-to-treat analysis indicated a 268% increase in walking distance in the PXF group (vs 198% in the placebo group p<0.05) at 6 months and an increase of 404% (vs 280% in the placebo group
