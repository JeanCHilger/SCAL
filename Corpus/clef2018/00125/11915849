Prevalence of lower extremity arterial disease defined by the ankle-brachial index among American Indians: the Inter-Tribal Heart Project. This study examines the prevalence of lower extremity arterial disease (LEAD) and its association with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors.Linear and logistic regression were used to analyze cross-sectional data from 1333 Chippewa and Menominee Indians.Approximately 6.4% of participants (6.9% of men, 6.1% of women) had LEAD. Among women, LEAD was associated with lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol higher levels of diastolic blood pressure, creatinine, and triglyceridesUse of the ankle-brachial index to assess LEAD is a noninvasive and inexpensive measurement that can be used by clinicians to identify persons at increased risk of developing CVD, and may provide opportunities to prevent CVD.
