Fibrinogen predicts restenosis after endovascular treatment of the iliac arteries. Fibrinogen is an acute phase protein as well as a component of the coagulation cascade. Vascular inflammation and disturbed coagulation are suggested to cause restenosis after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). We investigated the prognostic impact of fibrinogen on restenosis after endovascular treatment of iliac artery occlusive disease.In a prospective cohort study 137 consecutive patients after iliac artery PTA (n = 74) and PTA plus selective stent implantation (n = 63) were included, 109 patients after lower limb angiography served as a control group. Patients were followed for 6 months with oscillography, ankle brachial index and duplex sonography for occurrence of restenosis. Fibrinogen and serum amyloid A (SAA), as a control parameter of inflammation, were obtained at baseline, 8, 24 and 48 h postintervention.PTA (adjusted OR 3.1, p = 0.05) and stenting (adjusted OR 13.3, p = 0.001) were independently associated with a higher postintervention increase of fibrinogen compared to angiography. Restenosis was found in 29 patients (21%). Patients with pre-intervention fibrinogen values in the third quartile (411-463 mg/dl) had a 6.2-fold increased adjusted risk for restenosis (p = 0.03), patients in the fourth quartile (> 463 mg/dl) had a 8.9-fold increased adjusted risk (p = 0.007). Pre-intervention SAA values were also significantly associated with restenosis (p < 0.0001). Postintervention fibrinogen and SAA levels showed no association with outcome.Balloon angioplasty and stenting of the iliac arteries cause an elevation of postintervention fibrinogen levels independently of angiographic factors. A higher pre-procedure fibrinogen level, presumably a marker of inflammatory activity, indicates a higher risk for restenosis.
