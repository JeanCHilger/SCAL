Validation of a French translation of the Edinburgh claudication questionnaire among general practitioners' patients. Intermittent claudication is one of the clinical symptoms of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The presence of PAD is a high risk marker of cardiac events and stroke. The PAD screening can be enhanced by the use of questionnaires. The Edinburgh Questionnaire presents in its English version better diagnostic performances compared to the Rose (WHO) Questionnaire. The aim of this study is to precise the performances of the French version of the Edinburgh Questionnaire among a population consulting general practitioners.Four centers instructed 10 general practitioners each to the measurement of ankle pressure with a Doppler stethoscope. The physicians administrated the Questionnaire to 10 consecutive consultants in a same day, and measured the pressure on posterior tibial, dorsalis pedis and humeral arteries. With a second questionnaire they collected data concerning age, weight, height, and the presence of major risk factors. The same protocol was repeated a second day on new patients. The diagnosis of PAD was based on an ankle-arm index lower than 0.85 for at least on limb.The population studied consisted of 727 subjects (351 females and 376 males). The mean age was at 58.3 +/- 16.1 years (ranging from 18 to 83.3 years). The sensitivity of the Questionnaire is at 47% (95% CI: 32.3-61.7%), the specificity at 98.8% (95% CI: 97.5-99.4%), the positive and negative predictive values are respectively at 73.3% (95% CI: 54.1-87.7%) and 94.8% (95% CI: 94.7-97.6%). Among this population of general practitioners consultants, the prevalence of a low ankle-arm index under 0.85 is at 6.7%.The French version of the Edinburgh Questionnaire maintains the very good specificity of the English version. The lower sensitivity could be explained by the choice of the gold standard, namely the ankle-arm index which includes asymptomatic patients with authentic PAD. The use of this Questionnaire can be recommended for the screening of this disease as well as in epidemiological studies.
