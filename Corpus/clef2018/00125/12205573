Within- and between-day variability of respiratory impedance, using impulse oscillometry in adolescent asthmatics. The objectives of the present study were to: 1) assess spirometric indices and respiratory impedance with forced oscillation (FO), using impulse oscillometry (IOS) in clinically stable asthmatic children over 3 consecutive days 2) assess FO reactance (X), using an integrated index and resistance (R) separately during inspiration and expiration
