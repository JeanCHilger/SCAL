Midterm follow-up of balloon-expandable ePTFE endografts in the femoropopliteal segment. To evaluate the midterm clinical outcome of patients treated with a balloon-expandable polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) endograft for long-segment occlusive disease of the femoropopliteal segment.Eighty-nine patients (68 men median age 69 years, range 43-81) with disabling claudication (n=73) or critical ischemia (n=16) were treated with an ePTFE endograft (mean length 29 cm) for 7 stenosis (mean length 9 cm) and 82 occlusions (mean length 19 cm) in the femoropopliteal segment. The follow-up protocol included Doppler ankle-brachial pressure measurement and duplex scanning or angiography of the endograft at 6-month intervals. Primary and secondary patency rates were analyzed.At the last examination, the endograft was patent in 52 patients (median 17 months, range 7-50) and occluded in 35 (median 7 months, range 0-40) 2 patients died of nonvascular causes with a patent endograft at 6.5 and 7 months. At follow-up, the primary and secondary endograft patency rates were 71% and 83% at 6 months, 57% and 69% at 1 year, 45% and 49% at 2 years, and 30% and 44% at 3 years, respectively.The midterm success of this new ePTFE endograft is limited therefore, the device needs to be refined if this minimally invasive technique is to compete with conventional bypass surgery.
