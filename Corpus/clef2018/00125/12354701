Brachial gradient in cardiac surgical patients. Review of the clinical and therapeutic implications of difference in arm blood pressure detected preoperatively in patients having heart surgery.Prospective study of 53 patients (Group 1) with gradient and comparison with a group of 175 patients without gradient (Group 2). All patients had preoperative carotid duplex interrogation and operative epiaortic scanning. There was no statistical difference regarding age, sex, status, redo, diabetes, ejection fraction, prior myocardial infarct, hyperlipidemia, or creatinine level. Risks factors for Group 1 included peripheral vascular disease (P<0.0001) and cerebrovascular symptoms (P=0.0196). Severe carotid disease (>80% stenosis) was seen in 41.5% of Group 1 and 13.7% of Group 2 (P<0.0001) patients. Severe atherosclerotic proximal aortic disease was found in 39.6% of Group 1 and 10.8% of Group 2 (P<0.0001) patients. There were 7 patients with strokes in Group 1 (13.20%) and 9 in Group 2 (5.14% P=0.06). Four patients died in Group 1 (7.54%) and 10 died in Group 2 (5.71%Brachial gradient is a marker for increased carotid and proximal atherosclerotic aortic disease. Preoperative arch study at the time of catheterization is strongly recommended, as well as preoperative carotid Doppler and operative epiaortic ultrasound.
