Accuracy of the automated oscillometric device Lohmeier B-606, for blood pressure measurement in hospitals. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the accuracy of an automated oscillometric device, Lohmeier B-606, for clinical use in hospitals, according to there commendations of the European Society of Hypertension.Thirty-three subjects were studied. We performed three pair of sequential comparisons of blood pressure in each patient, first with mercury sphygmomanometer, second with the oscillometric device, obtaining a whole number of 99 comparisons.From the total 99 comparisons, 55 for SBP and 66 for DBP showed differences 3/4 5 mmHg, 86 and 88 differences 3/4 10 mmHg and 99 for SBP and DBP differences 3/4 15 mmHg. Mean differences between procedures (mercury-automatic) were 0.08 (confidence interval [IC] 95%: 14.1, 14.3) for SBP and 0.99 (95% CI: 11.0, 13.0) for DBP. Intraclass correlation coefficients were 0.975 for SBP and 0.944 for DBP.The blood pressure measurement oscillometric device Lohmeier B-606 satisfies the European Society of Hypertension criteria for clinical use in hospitals.
