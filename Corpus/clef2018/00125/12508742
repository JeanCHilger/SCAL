Percutaneous treatment of varicocele: considerations and our experience. Due to its high incidence and its affecting male infertility, varicocele is an important disease. Consequently, it is essential to choose the best treatment.Since 1999 to 2000, 75 patients affected by varicocele (mean age 25 years) underwent percutaneous retrograde sclerotherapy through a right transfemoral approach. Pre-operative tests included physical examination, sperm analysis and colour Doppler sonography. According to Dubin and Amelar classification, 59% of patients were affected by Grade 3 varicocele. According to Hirsh classification, grade III-IV varicocele was diagnosed with colour Doppler sonography in 77.3% of patients. Mean operative time was 30 minutes with only 5 minutes of exposure to radiation. All patients were followed-up with colour Doppler ultrasound and sperm analysis 1, 4 and 12 months after the treatment.In 6 of 75 patients (8%) sclerotherapy was unsuccessful because it was not possible to catheterize the spermatic vein. No significant complications were observed pre and post-operatively. 3 patients complained of mild testicular pain and 1 case had a transient hydrocele. The patients were dismissed during the next 24 hours after the procedure. During follow-up, physical examination was unremarkable in all patients, while occlusion of spermatic veins showed by Doppler ultrasound at 4 and 12 months was achieved in 94% of patients.Retrograde sclerotherapy through trans-femoral approach is a safe and effective treatment. In our opinion it should be considered as the treatment of choice, especially if we consider the costs, hospitalization and complications of conventional surgery and laparoscopy.
