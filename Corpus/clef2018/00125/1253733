Diagnosis of internal carotid artery obstructions (author's transl). The diagnostic value of directional ultrasound Doppler-sonography (UDS) of the supratrochlear (medial frontal) artery was evaluated by examination of 191 angiographically controlled cases in whom a carotid obstruction was suspected. A systematic compression of the facial and temporal arteries of both sides was performed. In 108 cases the UDS findings were normal, 6% of these were false negative and actually had a stenosis (n = 6) or occlusion (n = 2) of the internal carotid artery. In 88% of the pathological findings a stenosis (n = 39) or occlusion (n = 34) of the internal carotid artery was revealed by angiography. 79% of the stenoses were of severe degree (more than 50%). These results show that UDS is a useful diagnostic tool for the detection of severe stenoses or occlusions of the internal carotid artery. A distinction between stenosis and occlusion by UDS of the supratrochlear artery is, however, not possible, unless additional examination of the carotid arteries is performed. The method is not suitable for the detection of low grade stenoses.
