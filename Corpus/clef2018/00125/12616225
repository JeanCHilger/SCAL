Duplex sonography and ankle-brachial index in lower limb arterial disease: practical approach. The Société Française de Médecine Vasculaire and Société Française d'Imagerie Cardio-Vasculaire requested that ANAES perform an Health Technology Assessment (HTA) report entitled "Duplex Sonography in Lower Limb Arterial Disease". This report showed a wide variability of practices as well as for diagnostic criteria. The HTA Working Group wished to express that there was a consensual opinion to promote clinical practice harmonization.A working document was sent to the HTA Working Group and to a specifically selected Reading Group. A direct draft report was transcribed during the last Working Group meeting. This document was then sent to both Working Group and Reading Group for review and recommendations. The final version takes into account these comments.The consensual practical approach concerns the minimal equipment required to carry out a lower limb arterial Duplex Sonography, examination proceeding and its place according to the clinical situations (asymptomatic patient, claudication, critical ischemia, therapeutic situations support, clinical situations where Duplex Sonography is not justified).The document represents a special initiative of the Working Group implemented in the context of an ANAES HTA report. This document should not be considered as ANAES professional guidelines since its working method was not compliant with the ANAES method used to elaborate guidelines. Importantly, it represents the first consensual finalised document regarding this topic in France. It should be considered as a practical guide for professional use, and serve as a basis for the development of recommendations.
