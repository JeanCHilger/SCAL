Quantitative ultrasonographic studies of lower extremity flow velocities in health  and disease. Quantitative Doppler ultrasonographic flow velocity determinations are reported from 39 normal control subjects and 80 patients with angiographically documented peripheral arterial disease, in whom femoral, posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries were studied. The mean control values of the most useful parameters were: femoral artery: peak forward velocity (PFV) cm/sec: 40.7 +/- 10.9, deceleration (Dec.) cm/sec2:250.9 +/- 60.0, peak/mean velocity (P/MV): 4.8 +/- 1.6 posterior tibial artery: PFV: 16.0 +/- 10.0, Dec.: 129.8 +/- 75.7, P/MV: 4.8 +/- 2.5
