3D rotational angiography of transplanted kidneys. To develop a protocol for 3D rotational angiography (3D-RA) of the transplant renal artery.3D-RA was consecutively performed in 39 renal transplanted patients with suspicion of renal artery stenosis. A series of images were acquired while the C-arm of the equipment rotated around the region of interest. Contrast media in different concentrations were given through a 1.4 mm catheter with different sites of injection in the ipsilateral iliac artery. The 3D reconstructions were done at a workstation. Suspected stenoses were in most cases verified with pressure measurement, and a systolic pressure gradient of 10 mm Hg or more was regarded as significant.28 stenoses were found in 24/39 patients (62%) 21/28 (75%) were verified by pressure measurement. The 3D reconstructions gave a better description of the stenoses in 10 patients.3D-RA is a helpful supplement in cases with complicated vascular anatomy, especially when intervention may be indicated. The best results were achieved with the catheter tip in the proximal iliac artery and 70-75 ml of a high concentration contrast medium at a flow rate of 8-10 ml/s.
