Survey of tourniquet use in podiatric surgery. Tourniquet use in foot and ankle surgery is common practice however, the technique varies among foot and ankle surgeons and there are no standard guidelines. To analyze trends in foot and ankle tourniquet use, the authors conducted an e-mail survey. One thousand six hundred sixty-five foot and ankle surgeons were sent a tourniquet-use survey via e-mail, across Canada and the United States. Nineteen percent of the recipients completed and returned the surveys. Eleven (3.4%) rarely or never use a tourniquet and 8 (2.5%) use an Esmarch bandage tourniquet at the ankle. Most use pneumatic ankle cuffs (92% use, 27% use exclusively)
