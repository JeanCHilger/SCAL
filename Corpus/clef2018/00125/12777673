Bivalirudin as a foundation anticoagulant in peripheral vascular disease: a safe and feasible alternative for renal and iliac interventions. Many heparin (UFH) limitations are overcome by bivalirudin (Angiomax ). The pharmacokinetic profile of bivalirudin appears well suited for percutaneous peripheral intervention (PPI), yet few data exist regarding its safety and feasibility in this setting.One hundred and eighty renal and 75 iliac PPIs performed between May 2001 and June 2002 with bivalirudin as anticoagulation were compared to a historical UFH control. Variables evaluated included thrombotic events, intracranial bleeding, major surgical complications, sheath removal time, vascular access complication, time to ambulate and length of stay (LOS). Follow-up included 6-month renal and iliac duplex ultrasound and ankle-brachial index.Procedural success was achieved in 100% of patients treated with bivalirudin, with no thrombotic events, intracranial bleeding or major surgical complications observed. Procedural success was achieved in 179/180 (99%) renal and 74/75 (98.6%) iliac patients treated with UFH. Significant differences were observed for sheath removal time < 60 minutes (84% versus 59% p < 0.0001), time to ambulation < 6 hours (75.5% versus 58%Bivalirudin is a safe and feasible alternative anticoagulant in renal and iliac PPI and may offer decreased sheath removal time, time to ambulation and LOS. A larger prospective randomized multicenter trial is warranted.
