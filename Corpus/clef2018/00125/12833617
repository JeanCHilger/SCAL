The significance of laser Doppler flowmetry for the prognosis and outcome evaluation of lumbar sympathectomy in patients with obliterating vascular arteriosclerosis of lower extremities. The microcirculation state in lower extremities was studied using laser Doppler flowmetry in 37 patients with obliterating atherosclerosis before and after lumbar sympathectomy performance. It was established that laser Doppler flowmetry may be applied for estimation of the microcirculation bed functional state and prognosis of the lumbar sympathectomy results.
