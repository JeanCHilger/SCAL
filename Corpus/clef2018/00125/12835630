Preoperative assessment of stenosis of the epiaortic vessels: can colour-Doppler ultrasound really supplant angiography? To evaluate the diagnostic role of digital angiography compared with colour-Doppler US in the study of epiaortic vessel stenoses and the degree of morbidity associated with angiography.Out of 2,000 angiographic examinations of the epiaortic vessels performed for the concurrent presence of clinical findings of cerebrovascular insufficiency and colour-Doppler US findings of carotid-vertebral stenosis, a randomized sample of 200 patients was evaluated. The retrospective review of medical records provided the surgical data of the stenosis which were subsequently compared with the angiography and colour-Doppler US findings, and with the clinical and laboratory data to identify the possible complications of angiography.Diagnostic agreement was 75%. Colour-Doppler US underestimated stenosis in 16.5% and overestimated stenosis in 8% of cases. In 18% of cases there was a diagnostic gain of angiography (vascular lesions associated with main lesion), which also provided clinically important incidental findings (intracranial aneurysms, meningiomas) in 6.5% of patients. No relevant complications resulting from the angiographic procedure were recorded.Angiography allowed a more accurate evaluation of the degree of stenosis compared with colour-Doppler ultrasound. Moreover, it allowed diagnosis of important associated conditions that may affect therapeutic planning. In our series, we recorded no important complications related to angiography. Therefore, angiography remains the standard of reference in the preoperative evaluation of patients with clinically diagnosed cerebral ischaemia. Though fairly reliable as a first-line investigation, Colour-Doppler US is not sufficiently exhaustive as a pre-operative evaluation tool.
