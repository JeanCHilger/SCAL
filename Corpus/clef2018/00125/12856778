Cardiovascular effects of propofol alone and in combination with ketamine for total intravenous anesthesia in cats. To compare cardiovascular effects of equipotent infusion doses of propofol alone and in combination with ketamine administered with and without noxious stimulation in cats.6 cats.Cats were anesthetized with propofol (loading dose, 6.6 mg/kg constant rate infusion [CRI], 0.22 mg/kg/min) and instrumented for blood collection and measurement of blood pressures and cardiac output. Cats were maintained at this CRI for a further 60 minutes, and blood samples and measurements were taken. A noxious stimulus was applied for 5 minutes, and blood samples and measurements were obtained. Propofol concentration was decreased to 0.14 mg/kg/min, and ketamine (loading dose, 2 mg/kgMean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, pulmonary arterial occlusion pressure, stroke index, cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance index, pulmonary vascular resistance index, oxygen delivery index, oxygen consumption index, oxygen utilization ratio, partial pressure of oxygen in mixed venous blood, pH of arterial blood, PaCO2, arterial bicarbonate concentration, and base deficit values collected during propofol were not changed by the addition of ketamine and reduction of propofol. Compared with propofol, ketamine and reduction of propofol significantly increased mean pulmonary arterial pressure and venous admixture and significantly decreased PaO2.Administration of propofol by CRI for maintenance of anesthesia induced stable hemodynamics and could prove to be clinically useful in cats.
