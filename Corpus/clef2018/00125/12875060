The effects of Chinese medicines on micro-circulation of nail folds and blood flow velocity of limbs in the patients with arteriosclerotic obliteration. The effects of Chinese medicines on micro-circulation and blood flow velocity in arteries of the lower limbs were observed in 33 patients with arteriosclerotic obliteration (ASO). The results showed that the integral values of micro-circulation after treatment were obviously higher than those before treatment (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). Blood flow velocity in arteries of the lower limbs determined with the color Doppler ultrasound detecting method after treatment were also obviously higher than those before treatment (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). In this series of 33 ASO patients, the markedly effective rate was 36.36%, and the total effective rate was 63.64%. The observation indicates that the recipe prescribed according to the principle of supplementing qi and activating blood circulation can effectively improve micro-circulation in ASO patients, and accelerate blood flow in arteries of the lower limbs.
