Doppler ultrasound imaging of the radial artery after catheterization. Coronarography and coronary angioplasty via radial artery is associated with a minimal vascular risk. Nevertheless, the incidence of radial occlusion and its consequences are little known. In a prospective study, 300 patients with a positive Allen test were evaluated on patency of the radial artery after a coronarography or an angioplasty, by physical and ultrasound examination before, at discharge and after. At discharge, occlusion rate was 1.3%, and at 3 months follow-up, this rate was less than 1%. In this study, we didn't find any ischemic complication and any diameter or flow variations before and after transradial approach. In conclusion, radial artery occlusion risk is minor and without clinical consequence.
