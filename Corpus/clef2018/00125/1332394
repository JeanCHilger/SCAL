Color Doppler imaging of the eye and orbit. A synopsis of a 400 case experience. Color Doppler imaging (CDI) is a recent advance in ultrasonography that allows simultaneous two-dimensional imaging of structure and blood flow. Doppler information is superimposed in color over a conventional gray-scale ultrasound image. Using this technique we have examined 400 eyes. The central retinal artery, posterior ciliary arteries, ophthalmic artery, the central retinal vein and the vortex veins could be located in all normal eyes. Using the color image as a guide, Doppler spectral analysis is used for quantitative assessment of blood flow velocity in these vessels. We also studied patients with intraocular tumors, arterial and venous retinal occlusions, orbital vascular anomalies and tumors. Color Doppler imaging is a new and promising modality for the study of ocular and orbital hemodynamics.
