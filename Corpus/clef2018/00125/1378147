Hemodynamic effects of carvedilol after acute oral administration in hypertensive and normal subjects. Forearm hemodynamics using pulsed Doppler flowmetry were studied in nine healthy volunteers and 12 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension before and after acute oral administration of the beta-blocking and vasodilating agent carvedilol. Both the 25- and the 50-mg dose produced a significant blood pressure reduction by comparison with placebo in normotensive and hypertensive subjects. Only the 50-mg dose caused a decrease in forearm vascular resistance in hypertensive subjects. The decrease disappeared after wrist occlusion. Although brachial artery diameter did not change, a significant decrease in tangential tension was observed. This study provides evidence that carvedilol produced arteriolar dilation within the forearm of hypertensive subjects in association with a decrease in brachial artery tangential tension.
