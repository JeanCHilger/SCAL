Effects of the Berlin Heart biventricular assist device on microvascular responses in pre-transplant patients. Microcirculatory forearm cutaneous blood flow was monitored continuously and noninvasively by laser doppler flow-metry (LDF) in 15 patients treated with the Berlin Heart biventricular assist device system (BVAD) for end-stage heart failure under stable hemodynamic states (BVAD pts, n = 10) and norepinephrine therapy (BVAD nor pts, n = 5). Ten healthy human subjects served as controls (C). Cutaneous blood flow was measured before, during, and after external brachial artery occlusion to evaluate the post-occlusive reactive hyperemia (PORH) as a standardized response. To examine microvascular responses to macrohemodynamic changes, the cardiac output (CO) was decreased by a 20% reduction in BVAD pump rate. No significant differences in baseline LDF measurements (in millivolts) were observed among the three groups (C, 470.7 mV +/- 177.3 BVAD pts, 328.0 mV +/- 122.7
