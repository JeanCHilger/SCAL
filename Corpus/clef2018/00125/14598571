Correlation of lower extremity Doppler index with flow-mediated vasodilation and the extent of coronary disease. The aim of this study was to examine relationship between resting ankle-brachial pressure index and flow mediated vasodilation, and that of the extent of coronary artery disease.Authors examined 77 subjects. All had peripheral arterial disease (with ankle-brachial pressure index less than 0.8), and angina pectoris (coronary artery disease verified by coronary angiography). Mean age was 64.6 years (range 41-82 years). Flow mediated (endothelial dependent) vasodilatation was measured for all participiant.Authors stated, that ankle-brachial pressure index significantly correlates with flow mediated vasodilatation and the same connection can be supposed between Doppler index and coronary artery disease's extension.
