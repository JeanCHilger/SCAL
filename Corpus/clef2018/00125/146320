Experimental findings in liver perfusion measurements using an ultransonic Doppler flowmeter. 1. The ultrasonic doubling method of bloodflow measurement is an experimental easily practicable and very exactly recording measurement arrangement. By this method data of other methods were extended and ensured. 2. Early inquested finding is attested that after inhibition of portal vein bloodflow and after portocaval anastomosis an increased arterial perfusion of liver through a. hepatica is following. Increasing bloodflow of a. hepatica is independent of cardiac output. 3. After diminution of arterial perfusion by occlusion of a. hepatica no increased portal bloodflow is following. 4. It is to suppose an "intrahepatic regulation of liver bloodflow". It seems economical that the perfusion part of the a. hepatica with her higher oxygen content is increasing when the general perfusion is decreasing by diminished portal bloodflow or diminished blood pressure. So far it is impossible to interpret whether this accomodation is based on a difficult "auto-regulation" or is originated pressure passive from the flow together of two systems are staying under different pressure.
