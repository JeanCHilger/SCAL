Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity measured automatically by oscillometric method is elevated in diabetic patients with incipient nephropathy. To examine whether brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), a possible early marker of atherosclerotic vascular damage, is associated with albuminuria in patients with Type 2 diabetes.BaPWV was measured by automatic oscillometric method in 346 Type 2 diabetic patients with normoalbuminuria (a mean level of three times measurements of albumin-to-creatinine (ACR)<30 microg/mg creatinine n=200), incipient nephropathy (a mean level of ACR> or =30 and <300 microg/mg creatinineBaPWV (cm/s) was significantly higher in patients with incipient nephropathy (1722 +/- 382) and clinical nephropathy (1763 +/- 322) than in patients with normoalbuminuria (1559 +/- 343, P<0.0001, respectively). By univariate analysis it correlated significantly with age (r=0.44, P<0.0001), systolic blood pressure (r=0.55, P<0.0001), diastolic blood pressure (r=0.42, P<0.0001), albuminuria (r=0.24, P<0.0001) and HbA1C (r=0.11, P<0.05). Albuminuria revealed an independent significant association with baPWV (P<0.01) after adjustment for age, sex, smoking, BMI, HbA1C, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. Multiple regression analysis showed age, diastolic blood pressure and albuminuria were independently associated with baPWV (adjusted R2=0.42, P<0.0001).The results might indicate a possible link between the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and diabetic nephropathy. Future studies are needed to clarify the usefulness and its predictable value.
