Vasotonometry in the episcleral arteries in the diagnosis of stenotic lesions of the extracranial sections of the carotid arteries. The object of the work was evaluation of the method of vasotonometry (VTM) in the episcleral arteries in recognizing stenoses of the extracranial part of the internal carotid artery (ICA). The examination was conducted by means of a specially designed vasotonometer in patients suffering from ischemic type cerebral circulatory disorders. The authors examined 98 patients and 20 healthy volunteers. The parameters of the diagnostic sensitivity of the method in various degrees and forms of the stenotic lesions of the ICA were determined. The correct diagnosis of a hemodynamically significant ICA stenosis was established in 85% of patients. The results of the examination were confirmed by angiography and operation.
