Femoropopliteal stent placement: long-term results. Twenty-one patients who underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) followed by attempted insertion of a self-expandable vascular endoprosthesis for femoropopliteal lesions were prospectively followed up for an average of 17.6 months with angiographic, Doppler ultrasound, and clinical examinations. Stents were placed bilaterally in one patient. Of the 22 lesions, 18 were total occlusions and four, stenoses. Stent placement was successful in 21 of 22 lesions. Nine occlusions occurred: four in the first 30 days and five 1-5 months after PTA. Three patients developed intrastent intimal hyperplasia that necessitated an additional percutaneous procedure. At 12 months, the patency rate without other interventions (the primary patency rate) was 49%. In patients who underwent secondary intervention (fibrinolysis, atherectomy, or PTA), the secondary patency rate was 67%, which fell to 56% after 18 months. At the end of the study, the overall rate of reocclusion was 43%. It is concluded that use of the self-expandable vascular endoprosthesis in the femoropopliteal region likely does not decrease the reocclusion rate after PTA alone. Its use is indicated for treatment of acute closures after femoropopliteal PTA.
