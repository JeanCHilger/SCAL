Ethnic differences in peripheral arterial disease in the NHLBI Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy (GENOA) study. Few studies have investigated whether ethnic groups differ in the prevalence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). We compared the distribution of the ankle-brachial index (ABI), a measure of PAD, between African Americans and non-Hispanic white individuals. Subjects (n = 931) belonged to the Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy (GENOA) study, a community-based study of hypertensive sibships, and included 453 African Americans from Jackson, Mississipi (mean age 72 +/- 6 years, 69% women) and 478 non-Hispanic white individuals from Rochester, Minnesota (mean age 58 +/- 7 years, 64% women). ABI was determined at two sites in each lower extremity and the lowest of four indices was used in the analyses. PAD was defined as an ABI of < or = 0.95. Information about conventional risk factors was derived from interviews and from blood samples drawn at the study visit. The prevalence of diabetes and hypertension was significantly higher in African Americans than in non-Hispanic white individuals. After adjusting for age, African American subjects had a lower mean ABI (women 0.97 vs 1.04, p < 0.001 men 0.96 vs 1.12, p < 0.001) and a greater prevalence of PAD (women 34% vs 22%, p = 0.010
