Vulvar venous malformations in an 11-year-old girl: a case report. Unlike varicosities, which result from venous insufficiency, vascular malformations are developmental errors that do not regress. While these lesions are challenging to treat in most anatomic locations, genital venous malformations are particularly difficult problems for the gynecologist, urologist, or primary care physician who may identify them. The risk of surgical treatment has led to investigation of new therapeutic options for these vascular lesions.We describe an 11-year-old premenarchal female with bilateral, symptomatic vulvar venous malformations. These lesions were successfully treated with Doppler ultrasound-guided direct injection venography and ethanol sclerotherapy.Direct injection venography with ethanol sclerotherapy is an attractive diagnostic and therapeutic option for management of vulvar venous malformations.
