Uses in vascular symptomatology of the ultrasonic flowmeter with Doppler effect in patients revascularized for peripheral obliterating arteritis. The Authors present 38 cases of surgical revascularization for arteriosclerosis obliterans of the lower extremities, operated in Clinica Chirurgica of Ancona during the space of three Years, from 1974-1977. The morphological profile of the sphygmic wave and pressures of occlusion or Travis Winsor's index were studied pre and postoperatively with Doppler ultrasonic flowmeter. The patency of vascular grafts and after thromboendarterectomy was shown by T.W.'s index. With this method, besides establishing a program for postoperative arteriography, a lesser use of the latter was shown.
