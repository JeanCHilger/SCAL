Imaging diagnosis and interventional therapy of transplant renal artery stenosis. To discuss the diagnostic methods of transplant renal artery stenosis (TRAS) and clinical outcome following percutaneous transluminal angioplasty.Of 24 patients with TRAS screened by color Doppler ultrasound and confirmed with digital subtraction angiography, balloon angioplasty was performed in 19 patients, and 5 patients received stent implantation, including 2 cases of recurrent stenosis.Technical success was achieved in all procedures with no serious complications. The blood pressure and serum creatinine levels of all patients were remarkably decreased (P < 0.01). Renal functions of the two patients with restenosis were significantly improved after intra-arterial stenting.Doppler ultrasonography is useful in the screening and follow-up of TRAS and arteriography is still the definite diagnostic method. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting are safe and effective procedures to treat TRAS.
