Abnormal mechanical properties of larger arteries in postmenopausal women with systemic lupus erythematosus. There is limited knowledge of potential defects in arterial wall properties in female systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients without manifest cardiovascular disease (CVD) and significant atherosclerotic lesions. The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanical properties of larger vessels in these patients and to compare them with healthy controls. B-mode ultrasound was used to assess vessel wall structure and to exclude presence of plaque. The ankle/brachial pressure index was measured to exclude occlusive arterial disease. An ultrasound echo-tracking system was used to determine stiffness of the abdominal aorta, common carotid artery (CCA) and popliteal artery (PA) in 39 female patients with SLE and 55 female, healthy controls. SLE had an independent effect on stiffening of the CCA (P = 0.01) and PA (P = 0.005). In addition, larger vessel diameters were observed in the CCA (P = 0.002) after adjustments for the effects of mean arterial pressure and age. Thus, this investigation demonstrated an increased arterial stiffness and signs of premature vascular ageing in the SLE patients without manifest cardiovascular disease and without significant atherosclerotic lesions. The results of this study indicate that other mechanisms besides atherosclerosis might be involved in the pathogenesis of arterial stiffening in SLE patients.
