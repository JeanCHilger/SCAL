Systemic vasculitis as an interdisciplinary problem. Systemic vasculitis (SV) is characterized by generalized vascular bed lesion involving vessels of different sizes into a pathological process. The paper presents the results of a follow-up of 500 patients with different forms of SV, by making studies of immunity and the hemostatic system, angioscanning, Doppler ultrasound study of vessels, electrophysiological studies (rheoencephalography, encephalography), computed and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, and visceral ultrasonography. A variety of clinical symptoms and involvement of different organs determine the interest of physicians of different specialties in the diagnosis and treatment of SV. The involvement of the nervous system in the process occurs in all forms of vasculitis, by afflicting the central, peripheral, and autonomic nervous systems with the development of regulatory and functional disorders. Lesions of the visual organ are typical of nonspecific aortoarteritis (Takayasu's disease), Wegener's granulomatosis, giant-cell arteritis. Recurrent uveitis is characterized in Behcet's syndrome. Cutaneous manifestations are included into the classification criteria of nodal polyartheritis, hemorrhagic vasculitis, and Kawasaki's disease. ENT and oral involvement are observed in Wegener's granulomatosis.
