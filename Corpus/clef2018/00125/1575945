Relationship between initial cardiovascular structural changes and daytime and nighttime blood pressure monitoring. It has been shown that in hypertensive patients the degree of target organ damage correlates more closely with average blood pressure as recorded by ambulatory monitoring (ABPM) throughout 24 h than with clinic blood pressure. We examined a group of 91 clinically healthy subjects, 23 normotensives and 68 hypertensives according to clinic blood pressure. Cardiac anatomy was investigated by echocardiography. As an index of arterial structural changes forearm minimal vascular resistance was calculated from mean arterial pressure and maximal postischemic blood flow, as assessed by venous occlusion plethysmography. The results were correlated to clinic blood pressure or ABPM values (measured by noninvasive ABPM ICR 5200, Spacelabs, Bellevue, CA). Left ventricular mass was correlated more closely with the average blood pressure recorded during 24 h, or during daytime or nighttime periods, than with clinic blood pressure. Minimal vascular resistance was also significantly correlated to ABPM values, but the correlation was similar to that observed with clinic blood pressure. Minimal vascular resistance was significantly correlated to blood pressure variability, as evaluated by the standard deviation of the mean. Minimal vascular resistance and left ventricular mass were higher in a subgroup of patients in whom blood pressure was not significantly reduced during the night. The results of this study confirm that elevated average ABPM values are associated to higher left ventricular mass in addition, they suggest that increased blood pressure variability may be associated with vascular structural changes, as evaluated by minimal vascular resistance. It remains to be clarified whether cardiac hypertrophy and/or vascular structural changes are a cause or consequence of increased blood pressure values and variability.
