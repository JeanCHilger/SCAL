Prognostic impact of aortic calcification index and ankle-arm blood pressure index in patients under hemodialysis. The mortality rate is high in patients receiving hemodialysis (HD), atherosclerotic diseases being the major cause of death. As marker of clinical outcome, a prospective examination of atherosclerotic tests and atherosclerotic risk factors in patients receiving HD was performed. On April 2000, 84 patients receiving HD were followed up until April 2002. At entry to the study, several atherosclerotic tests, including ankle-arm blood pressure index (API), aortic calcification index (ACI), and atherosclerotic risk factors, were performed. In 36 patients with old thrombotic events, 26 had new thrombotic events. Of 48 patients without previous thrombotic events, 15 had new thrombotic events. During 2 years, 41 patients had new thrombotic events and 15 patients died due to thrombotic disorders. The HD durations were significantly longer in non-survivors than survivors and the body mass index was lower in non-survivors than survivors. There was a significant difference in the values of ACI and API between survivors and non-survivors, and between patients with and without thrombotic events. These findings suggest that the ACI and API have a prognostic value because they might predict the occurrence of thrombosis.
