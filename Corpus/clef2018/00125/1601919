The impact of angiodynography on infrainguinal bypass graft surveillance. We have followed 64 lower extremity in situ grafts and 56 selected vein or prosthetic grafts with serial angiodynography since 1988 (Quantum Color-flow Duplex) and ankle/brachial indices (ABI). Each graft can be scanned in 20 minutes. Scan results affected clinical decision making in 26 cases. There were ten graft stenoses, 10 distal stenoses, 5 large arteriovenous fistulas (AFV), and one limb with a stenosis and AFV. Four other limbs had incompressible vessels and normal angiodynograms. There were no false positives. Twenty-eight graft revisions were performed in 24 patients. Seven stenoses detected by angiodynogram were not accompanied by changes in ABI. Cumulative patency of revised grafts were 61% at 3 years. The detection of graft or distal arterial stenoses by color flow changes is accurate and rapid. Scanning is recommended for all lower extremity bypass grafts. ABI alone is not sufficient. Scanning helps in planning the surgical incision and may obviate arteriography in selected cases.
