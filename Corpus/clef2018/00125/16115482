Correlation of plasma homocysteine level with arterial stiffness and pulse pressure in hemodialysis patients. Elevated plasma homocysteine, arterial stiffness, and increased pulse pressure (PP) are independently associated with higher cardiovascular risk in patients with end-stage renal disease. The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of plasma homocysteine on arterial stiffness and PP in hemodialysis (HD) patients. One hundred and nine HD patients were stratified into three groups by plasma homocysteine levels: low (11.2-20.8 micromol/L), middle (21.2-25.1 micromol/L), and high tertiles of plasma homocysteine (Hcy) group (25.2-43.9 micromol/L). Using a computerized oscillometry, we measured the arterial stiffness index (ASI) and blood pressure (BP) hemodynamic parameters in the brachial artery. The high Hcy group exhibited a higher ASI (110.4+/-129.5 versus 46.2+/-17.5, mean+/-S.E., P<0.01), PP (59.7+/-23.1 versus 43.3+/-16.3 mmHg, P<0.01), and age (57.8+/-14.1 versus 49.9+/-12.7 years, P<0.05) compared with the low Hcy group. Plasma homocysteine was significantly correlated with ASI (r=0.25, P<0.001), PP (r=0.33, P<0.001), systolic BP (r=0.31, P<0.001), and age (r=0.24, P<0.05). Serum ferritin was significantly correlated with ASI (r=0.24, P<0.05) and PP (r=0.23, P<0.05). ASI was also correlated with PP (r=0.64, P<0.001). Multiple regression analyses showed that both plasma homocysteine and serum ferritin had significant associations with ASI (beta=4.246, P=0.007 and beta=0.024, P=0.006, respectively), and with PP (beta=1.089, P=0.002 and beta=0.005, P=0.005, respectively) independent of other classic risk factors for atherosclerosis. In conclusion, plasma homocysteine, along with serum ferritin, may act as an important predictor for arterial stiffness and PP in HD patients.
