Diabetes mellitus, smoking, and the risk for asymptomatic peripheral arterial disease: whom should we screen? To describe coexisting medical conditions and lifestyle factors associated with asymptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in a population of white, African American, and Hispanic patients.White, African American, and Hispanic patients 50 years or older were recruited for this cross-sectional study from 4 primary care clinics in Houston, TX. Patients with an ankle-brachial index (ABI) < 0.9 and without leg symptoms typical of PAD were diagnosed with asymptomatic PAD.403 patients were screened for PAD. Of these, 25 (6.2%) had asymptomatic PAD. Compared with patients without PAD, diabetes mellitus ([OR] 3.8 95% CI 1.6, 9.0) and a history of smoking at least 1 pack of cigarettes per day ([OR] 2.5The ankle-brachial index could become routine screening among patients with diabetes mellitus and/or who smoke.
