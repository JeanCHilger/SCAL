Flow motion pattern differences in the forehead and forearm skin: Age-dependent alterations are not specific for Alzheimer's disease. Oscillations in laser Doppler signals derived from the forehead and forearm skin were analyzed in 77 healthy probands from 4 various age groups (ranging between 15 and 77 years) and 22 late-onset sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. A characteristic pattern of oscillations in the microcirculatory blood flux ( approximately 8 cycles/min, 0.13 Hz) was observed in the forehead skin, the occurrence of which correlated inversely with age (r = 0.80). The occurrence of forehead vasomotion pattern was 100% in the teenagers, whereas it was significantly less in the elderly control subjects (32%) and in the AD patients (18%). Forearm reactive hyperemia was provoked by 1-min occlusion of the brachial artery, and the vascular reactivity was calculated. This phenomenon also proved to be age-dependent, but the process was not related to AD. Our results indicate that the lack of forehead vasomotion reflects aging better than does the forearm vasomotion. Both of these functions are preserved in AD.
