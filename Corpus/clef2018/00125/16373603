Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 and measures of extracoronary atherosclerosis: the Rotterdam Study. Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) may be a new and independent predictor of cardiovascular events. The effect of Lp-PLA2 may be exerted through effects of the enzyme on the development of atherosclerosis. Therefore, we investigated the association between Lp-PLA2 activity and measures of extracoronary atherosclerosis.Lp-PLA2 activity was determined in a random sample of 1820 participants from the Rotterdam Study, a population-based cohort study in men and women > or =55 years. Common carotid intima-media thickness, carotid plaques, ankle-arm index, and aortic calcification were examined. Atherosclerosis status could be assigned in 1609 participants. The age-adjusted odds ratio of having atherosclerosis at any site for the highest versus the lowest tertile of Lp-PLA2 activity was 1.86 (95% CI, 1.01 to 3.43) in men and 1.60 (95% CI, 1.08 to 2.37) in women. After additional adjustment for cholesterol, these associations attenuated or even disappeared. The odds ratios of having atherosclerosis at specific sites (carotid arteries and aortic-iliac-femoral tract) followed a similar pattern.Although Lp-PLA2 has been found to be independently associated with cardiovascular events, the association with measures of subclinical extracoronary atherosclerosis found in this study strongly attenuated or even disappeared after adjustment for cholesterol.
