Chlorthalidone improves endothelial-mediated vascular responses in hypertension complicated by nondiabetic metabolic syndrome. The study was conducted to evaluate the vascular effects of chlorthalidone, a distal tubule-acting natriuretic agent, in hypertensive patients with nondiabetic metabolic syndrome, an insulin-resistant condition characterized by endothelial dysfunction and high risk for diabetes mellitus development.Thirteen untreated hypertensive patients with Adult Treatment Panel-III-defined nondiabetic metabolic syndrome were assigned to 3-month treatment with chlorthalidone. The end-points were baseline and post-treatment evaluation of (1) forearm blood flow (strain-gauge plethysmography) responses to graded intra-arterial acetylcholine infusion to test endothelial-mediated vasomotor function, with sodium nitroprusside as a control for endothelium-independent vasodilatation (2) minimum forearm vascular resistance, the ratio of mean blood pressure and maximal blood flow in response to 13-minute arterial occlusion, as a hemodynamic correlate of arteriolar structureChlorthalidone reduced blood pressure, augmented acetylcholine-mediated vasodilatation, decreased minimum forearm resistance, and slowed the transcapillary albumin escape rate. Metabolic parameters did not change significantly except for an increase in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.Chlorthalidone improved endothelial function, reversed abnormal arteriolar structure, and slowed albumin permeation in hypertensive patients with nondiabetic metabolic syndrome.
