Splenic artery stump back pressure. Splenic arterial collateral hemodynamics were measured during splenic artery occlusion in 15 patients who had splenic to left renal artery bypass. The mean splenic artery stump back pressure during proximal splenic artery clamping was 48.0 +/- 9.8 mmHg (mean +/- ISD) and the mean collateral splenic perfusion pressure was 34.3 +/- 9.4 mmHg. The lowest measured back pressure was 39 mmHg and the lowest perfusion pressure was 30 mmHg. There were no spleen complications after operation. These measurements establish a normal range for collateral splenic perfusion pressure. These results may be helpful in clinical decisions about the adequacy of splenic circulation in operations that require division of the splenic artery or the short gastric arteries when there is celiac axis or splenic artery occlusive disease.
