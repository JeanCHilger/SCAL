Coronary artery stenosis provokes non-uniformity of two-dimensional deformation in the anterior wall of the feline left ventricle. The effect of coronary stenosis on the uniformity of local left ventricular contraction was studied in 11 open-chest cats. Coronary artery stenosis was established by controlled constriction of a shunt line from the right subclavian artery to the left main coronary artery. Two pairs of ultrasonic crystals were placed in the midwall of the anterior left ventricular wall one pair, circumferential (Circ), aligned with midwall and subepicardial fibres
