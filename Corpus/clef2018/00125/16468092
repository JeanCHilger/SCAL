Influence of multiple stenoses on echo-Doppler functional diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease: a numerical and experimental study. The objective of this paper was to evaluate the ability of the peak systolic velocity ratio (PSVR) and pressure drop (DeltaP) to detect and grade multiple stenoses in lower limb mimicking arteries. Numerical simulations and experiments in vascular phantoms allowing ultrasound duplex scanning and pressure measurements were used to investigate simple and double stenotic arterial segments. Inter-stenotic distance, severity of the distal stenosis, flow rate and flow profile (steady or pulsatile) were the tested parameters. The three-dimensional simulations considered the turbulent two-equation Wilcox model. Agreements were observed between the experimental and numerical results for DeltaP and PSVR. The maximum PSVR along the artery was shown to be mainly influenced by the severity of the most important stenosis. However, mutual interactions of both stenoses on hemodynamics were noted. By using the clinical PSVR threshold used to diagnose critical lesions (PSVR > or = 2), its longitudinal evolution along the artery poorly reflected the length of the lesion or the impact of surrounding stenoses. This investigation confirms the interaction between adjacent stenoses on hemodynamics and its impact on the Doppler ultrasound index PSVR.
