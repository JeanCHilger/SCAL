Angiographic long-term follow-up of primary apical ballooning of the left ventricle. Acute and reversible left ventricular apical wall motion abnormalities presenting with chest pain, electrocardiographic (EKG) changes and cardiac markers release, in the absence of coronary artery stenosis, have already been identified as a possible distinct clinical entity: the so-called Tako-Tsubo syndrome. A 65-year-old man with history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and smoking, was admitted at the emergency room of a secondary referral institution with a severe and prolonged (45 min) chest pain, irradiated to the left arm, associated with neurovegetative syndrome. The clinical presentation suggested an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Interestingly no coronary artery stenoses or vasospasm reaction to administration of acetylcholine could be detected. A slow flow phenomenon was present. The left ventricle angiography confirmed a mild depression of left ventricle systolic function (EF 45%), with akinesia of antero-lateral wall and the typical apical ballooning-like profile. At 3-month follow-up, the patient continued to be asymptomatic and the echocardiogram showed a progressive normalization of left ventricle segmental motion and ejection fraction with a complete restoration only after 6 months. At 1 year the coronary angiography confirmed the absence of coronary stenosis, with complete regression of the ventricular apical ballooning at left ventricle catheterization. At two-year follow-up the patient is still asymptomatic. A slow resolution of the syndrome should be included in the diagnostic criteria for apical ballooning.
