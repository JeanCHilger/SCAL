AMPD1 gene polymorphism and the vasodilatory response to ischemia. Peripheral vasculature resistance can play an important role in affecting blood pressure and the development of cardiovascular disease. A better understanding of the genes that encode vasodilators, such as adenosine, will provide insight into the mechanisms underlying cardiovascular disease. We tested whether the adenosine monophosphate deaminase-1 (AMPD1) C34T gene polymorphism was associated with the vasodilatory response to ischemia in Caucasian females aged 18-35 years. Blood samples (n = 58) were analyzed for the C34T variant and resulted in the following genotype groups: CC (n = 45) and CT (n = 13). Mean blood pressure (MBP), heart rate, and forearm blood flow (FBF) measured by venous occlusion plethysmography were measured at baseline and at 1 (peak FBF), 2 and 3 min of vasodilation during reactive hyperemia following 5 min of arm ischemia. To control for interindividual variability in baseline FBF and forearm vascular resistance (FVR) the percent change in FBF and FVR were calculated for each min. The percent decrease in FVR was significantly greater in the CT compared to the CC genotype group (-40+/-4% vs. -24+/-3%, P = 0.01) during the 2nd min of reactive hyperemia. The percent increase in FBF tended to be greater in the CT compared to the CC genotype group (+69+/-9% vs. +42+/-9%, P = 0.07) during the 2nd min of reactive hyperemia after adjustment for percent body fat. Consistent with previous findings of increased production of adenosine during exercise in individuals carrying a T allele, our findings suggest that the AMPD1 C34T polymorphism is associated with vasodilatory response to ischemia in the peripheral vasculature because individuals with the T allele had a greater vasodilatory response to ischemia.
