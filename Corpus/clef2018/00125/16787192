The effects of prostaglandin E-1 in patients with intermittent claudication. Aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of Prostaglandin E-1 (PGE-1) in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) at the 2nd b stage Fontaine's classification. The study, controlled, single blinded, enrolled 123 patients with intermittent claudication that were randomised in two groups the first group received a treatment with PGE-1 while the second one received a pentoxifylline-buflomedil association by venous infusion. We evaluated: Pain Free Walking Distance (PFWD), Maximum Walking Distance (MWD), Rest Flow (RF), Peak Flow (PF), Basal (BVR) and Minimal Vascular Resistance (MVR) with a strain gauge plethysmograph, Resting Flow (RF), Peak Flow (PF), time to reach the Peak Flow (tPF) and time to recovery of the base values (tRF) with laser Doppler flowmeter. After a four weeks treatment, we observed an increase of 370% about PFWD and of 260% in the MWD in patients treated with PGE-1
