Prevalence of peripheral vascular disease in diabetics and impaired glucose regulation subjects: a community-based study. To investigate the prevalence of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and impaired glucose regulation (IGR).Follow-up 5 years after the previous epidemiologic study of metabolic syndrome in Chaoyang community, Shanghai, 2000 - 2001 was conducted among 717 patients with DM or IGR. Questionnaire survey about general status and DM-related history and behaviors, including smoking, was carried out. Physical examination was made. Ankle/brachial index (A/BI) was measured. Intermittent claudication was surveyed by Edinburgh claudication questionnaire (ECQ). Blood sugar and blood lipid were detected. 427 patients, 210 males and 217 females, aged 67.3 +/- 14.0 (21 - 104), with intact data were enrolled into the analysis.The overall prevalence of PVD was 12.2% in the hyperglycemic population. The prevalence of PVD in the diabetics was 15.1%, significantly higher than that of the IGP subjects (7.7%, P = 0.022). The rate of intermittent claudication in those with the A/BI <or= 0.9 was 13.5%. Logistic regression revealed that age, sex, diabetic duration, and total cholesterol were independent risk factors of diabetic PVD.The PVD prevalence is rather high in both diabetics and IGR subjects. Most PVD patients are asymptomatic. AB/I measurement helps early diagnosis of PVD.
