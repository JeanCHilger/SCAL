Chunghyul-dan (Qingxie-dan) improves arterial stiffness in patients with increased baPWV. Arterial stiffness is an important, independent determinant of cardiovascular risk. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) has been used as a valuable index of arterial stiffness and as a surrogate marker for atherosclerosis. Chunghyul-dan (CHD) has anti-hyperlipidemic activity, anti-inflammatory activity and anti-atherogenic effects. To determine its clinical effect on increased arterial stiffness, we examined whether CHD improves arterial stiffness in patients with increased brachial-ankle PWV (baPWV). Thirty-five subjects with increased baPWV (> 1400 cm/sec) were recruited and randomized to a treatment group (20 subjects) or a control group (15 subjects). The treatment group was administered CHD at a dose of 600 mg three times a day for 8 weeks, and the control group received no medication (observation only). baPWV was assessed using a pulse pressure analyzer at baseline and after 8 weeks. Blood pressure and serum lipid profile were monitored in the treatment group. Our results indicate that baPWV was lowered significantly in the treatment group after 8 weeks of medication (p < 0.05), but not in the control group. Moreover, there were no significant changes in blood pressure and serum lipids profile except triglyceride level suggesting that the effect is largely independent of CHD's lipid-lowering effect or a blood pressure change. In conclusion, CHD appears to improve arterial stiffness in patients with increased PWV.
