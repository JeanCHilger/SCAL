Falsely high ankle-brachial index predicts major amputation in critical limb ischemia. Falsely high ankle-brachial index (ABI) values are associated with an adverse clinical outcome in diabetes mellitus. The aim of the present study was to verify whether such an association also exists in patients with chronic critical limb ischemia (CLI) with and without diabetes. A total of 229 patients (74 +/- 11 years, 136 males, 244 limbs with CLI) were followed for 262 +/- 136 days. Incompressibility of lower limb arteries (ABI > 1.3) was found in 45 patients, and was associated with diabetes mellitus (p = 0.01) and renal insufficiency (p = 0.035). Limbs with incompressible ankle arteries had a higher rate of major amputation (p = 0.002 by log-rank). This association was confirmed by multivariate Cox regression analysis (relative risk [RR] 2.67 95% CI 1.27-5.64, p = 0.01). The relationship between ABI > 1.3 and amputation rate persisted after subjects with diabetes and renal insufficiency had been removed from the analysis (RR 3.85
