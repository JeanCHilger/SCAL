A review of microvascular measurements in wound healing. The microcirculatory evaluation in patients affected by arteriopathic or venous ulcers is usually carried out using laser Doppler flowmetry, transcutaneous oxygen (transcutaneous pressure of oxygen, TcPO(2)), and carbon dioxide (transcutaneous pressure of carbon dioxide, TcPCO(2)) measurements and capillaroscopy. These techniques provide significant pathophysiologic and prognostic information. TcPO(2) and TcPCO(2) diagnose and classify the extent of arterial disease in the leg ulcers caused by arterial disease the prognostic value is recognized, though doubts about its prognostic potential exist in the case of leg ulcer. Laser Doppler flowmetry is able to identify the first functional impairment in the early stages of the arterial disease and in the complicated venous insufficiency. Capillaroscopy gives us morphological and quantitative parameters of the capillary bed that is damaged in arteriopathic and venous ulcers
