Value of color doppler imaging in the diagnosis of occlusive retinal venous lesions. A hundred and twenty-five patients aged 47 to 72 years who had retinal venous occlusions were examined. Occlusion of the central retinal vein (CRV) was observed in 82 (65.6%) patients and that of CRV branches was seen in 43 (34.4%) patients. In all the patients, color Doppler imaging (CDI) was performed to study blood flow in the ophthalmic artery, central retinal artery (CRA), CRV, and short posterior ciliary arteries. The study indicated a marked reduction in diastolic velocity, no diastolic component of the Doppler blood flow spectrum, and a significant increase in the CRA resistance index (from 0.9 to 1.0), and a pronounced decrease in the maximum systolic velocity in the CRV, as well as a considerable reduction in blood flow velocity parameters, and a rise in the resistance index in the ophthalmic artery and short posterior ciliary arteries. CDI is a highly informative, non-invasive technique that makes it possible to study the blood flow in the CRA and CRV for the evaluation the severity of disease and the efficiency of therapy for occlusive retinal venous lesions.
