Age-related differences in invasive treatment of peripheral arterial disease: disease severity versus social support as determinants. Social support may influence the seeking of appropriate treatment. We examined social support and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) severity as determinants of treatment for PAD in younger and older patients.Consecutive PAD patients (N=203) completed the Perceived Social Support Scale. Treadmill-walking distance and ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) were measured. The main outcome was invasive treatment for PAD in the year following diagnosis.During follow-up, 48% of the patients underwent invasive treatment for PAD. Younger patients (<or=64 years) tended to be more often invasively treated as compared to older patients. In younger patients, a high level of social support predicted invasive treatment above and beyond PAD severity. In older patients, low ABPI predicted invasive treatment.Younger patients with inadequate social support may fail to seek appropriate treatment, suggesting the need to consider psychosocial factors in optimizing treatment of atherosclerotic vascular disease in this high-risk group.
