Color Doppler flow image of Budd-Chiari syndrome. To evaluate the diagnostic value of color Doppler flow image (CDFI) for the diagnosis of Budd-Chiari syndrome (B-CS).CDFI findings of 35 patients with B-CS were retrospectively analyzed and compared with the findings of venography of inferior vena cava (IVC).Thirty-four patients were diagnosed as B-CS by CDFI, while one patient with local tunica stenosis was misdiagnosed. The correct diagnostic rate was 97.1%. In the 34 patients, CDFI displayed stenosis or occlusion in the hepatic vein and IVC in 24 patients, IVC only in 8,and hepatic vein only in 2.CDFI may be a principal non-invasive technique to diagnose B-CS.
