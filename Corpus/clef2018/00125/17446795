Rationale, design, methods and baseline characteristics of the Asklepios Study. The Asklepios Study is a longitudinal population study focusing on the interplay between ageing, cardiovascular haemodynamics and inflammation in (preclinical) cardiovascular disease. The 2524 participants (1301 women) are a representative cohort of 35-55-year-old individuals, free from overt cardiovascular disease at study initiation, randomly sampled from the twinned Belgian communities of Erpe-Mere and Nieuwerkerken. Baseline examinations (all single-observer, single-device, single-site, single 2-year consecutive timeframe) include: questionnaires, conventional risk factors and biochemistry. Additional phenotypes under study include: (a) vascular structure and function: carotid and femoral atherosclerosis (intima-media thickness, plaque), arterial distension and pressure curves (brachial, carotid, femoral wall-tracking and applanation tonometry)
