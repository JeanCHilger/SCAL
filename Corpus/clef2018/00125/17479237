Peripheral arteries. Peripheral arterial disease is a main cause of morbidity in industrialised countries. It chiefly affects older people. The most common causes are atherosclerosis and vasodilatatory abnormalities. In the presence of unexplained leg symptoms, peripheral arterial disease can be diagnosed or ruled out by non-invasive diagnostic methods such as history, clinical examination and the measurement of ankle and brachial artery pressure by Doppler ultrasound, as well as by calculating the ankle brachial index. Colour coded duplex sonography, computer tomography angiography, magnetic resonance angiography and arteriography are the imaging modalities used. Current diagnostic strategies are analysed for the different peripheral artery diseases.
