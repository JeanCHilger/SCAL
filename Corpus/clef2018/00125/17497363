Associations between systemic and cerebral endothelial impairment determined by cerebrovascular reactivity to L-arginine. The relationships between cerebral and systemic endothelial (dys)function and between cerebral (dys)function and intima-media thickness (IMT) of carotid arteries in patients and healthy volunteers have not yet been clarified. In order to explore these issues, the authors performed a post hoc correlation analysis of cerebrovascular reactivity to L-arginine, a marker of cerebral endothelial function flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), a marker of systemic endothelial function
