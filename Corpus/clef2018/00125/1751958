The diagnosis by a Doppler color echocardiographic method of an aortocaval fistula following the rupture of an aortic aneurysm into the inferior vena cava. We describe a clinical case presenting 2 rare features. The first was a spontaneous aortocaval fistula which had developed from rupture of an atherosclerotic aortic aneurysm into the inferior vena cava. The second infrequent feature depended on the unusual method by which the diagnosis was performed. In fact, using an echo-color Doppler flow imaging (HP 77020A ultrasound system) with a 2.5 MHz echocardiographic probe abdominal examination showed an aneurysm of the descending aorta that communicated to a dilated inferior vena cava. Furthermore, flow study with color Doppler showed a continuous turbulent, mixed (arterial and venous) blood flow into the inferior vena cava.
