Cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the Brazilian Portuguese version of the Edinburgh Claudication Questionnaire. Translation, cultural adaptation and validation of the Brazilian Portuguese version of the Edinburgh Claudication Questionnaire (ECQ) a specific tool to assess intermittent claudication.The Brazilian Portuguese version of the ECQ was developed after authorization by the University of Edinburgh. It was applied to 217 individuals: SÃ£o Paulo Capital District residents with complaints of leg pain. Individuals under research were invited through mass communication media to participate in the I Campaign to Fight Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD). In stage 1, participants filled out the ECQ and another questionnaire on risk factors and cardiovascular history. In stage 2, participants had anthropometric measures and ankle-brachial index (ABI) at rest measured by vascular Doppler. In case of doubt, vascular treadmill test was applied (VTT). PAD condition was defined by ABI < or = 0.90 and/or positive VTT and/or documented PAD. Statistical analysis--which included performance assessment and the comparison between proportions and means--was performed using SAS software, version 8.2.Mean age of participants was 60+/-11.5 years, female sex predominated in the sample studied (53.4%). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy were 85%, 93%, 80%, 95% and 91%, respectively. No differences in performance were found between elderly (> or = 65 years) and non-elderly subjects.The Brazilian Portuguese version of the Edinburgh claudication questionnaire maintained good sensitivity and specificity and can be recommended for screening of PAD in clinical practice and epidemiological research in Brazil.
