Neural control of the forearm cutaneous vasoconstrictor response to dynamic exercise. This study was designed to evaluate the relative importance of intended effort ("central command") and of the absolute intensity of dynamic exercise to the cutaneous vasoconstrictor response to the onset of exercise in humans. Skin blood flow (laser-Doppler flowmetry) was measured from the forearm in six healthy individuals during 3-min periods of high- and low-intensity exercise with and without partial neuromuscular blockade. Cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC) was calculated from the ratio of skin blood flow to mean arterial pressure and expressed as a percent change from rest. A rating of perceived exertion (RPE) was expressed as a subjective measure of intended effort. Under control conditions, CVC decreased by 22% (median range 7-42%, P less than 0.05) during high-intensity exercise [218 (186-268) W
