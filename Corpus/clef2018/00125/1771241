Intravenous prostacyclin (PGI2) infusion to 108 patients with ischaemic peripheral vascular disease: phase II-open study. We recently reported the results of a double-blind trial of PGI2 in 108 patients with ischaemic peripheral vascular disease Stage II according to Fontaine. They were randomly allocated to receive an intravenous infusion of either PGI2 (6 ng/kg/min over 8 hours daily for 5 consecutive days) or placebo and classified as treatment responders or non-responders on the basis of changes in absolute and relative walking times. Patients treated with placebo and those who did not improve in this double blind trial entered an open trial in which they all received infusion of PGI2 (6 ng/kg/min over 8 hours daily for 5 consecutive days). The results of this open trial are reported here. Patients who had been allocated to PGI2 in the blind trial had significantly (p less than 0.01) longer walking times as compared to placebo-treated patients prior to receiving the second (PGI2) infusion. PGI2-infusion caused significant (p less than 0.01) prolongation of walking times in both groups up to the 2nd follow-up month. One month after infusion 52% (23 patients) of the initially placebo-treated patients and 31% (14 patients) of the initially PGI2-treated patients were scored as positive treatment responders (p less than 0.01).
