The value of 31 P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in follow up of Fontaine stage IIb peripheral arterial occlusive disease. The method of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy compared to the parameters absolute-, pain-free walking distance and ankle/arm coefficient in Doppler pressure was used for observation of patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease stage IIb according to Fontaine. While the classic parameters (walking distances, ankle/arm coefficient) described a homogenous group, NMR-spectroscopy parameters showed marked inter- and intraindividual variations during exercise. Further studies on high magnetic power fields, exercise patterns and muscle recreation analysis have to be carried out to develop a reliable system of non invasive muscle energy monitoring in vascular diseases.
