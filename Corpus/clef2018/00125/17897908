Interventional treatment of acute hepatic artery occlusion after liver transplantation. With the development of the associated technology, interventional treatment has become an important method for the treatment of hepatic artery occlusion in some countries. This study was undertaken to evaluate the role of interventional methods in the diagnosis and treatment of acute hepatic artery occlusion after liver transplantation.The diagnosis and treatment of 9 cases of acute hepatic artery occlusion after liver transplantation were retrospectively analyzed.In 109 cases of liver transplantation, 9 were diagnosed by angiography. Among them, 7 were diagnosed by Doppler ultrasound. After transcatheter thrombolysis, the hepatic arteries were partially or totally patent again in 6 cases of hepatic artery occlusion after liver transplantation, and stent placements in the hepatic artery were performed in 5 cases. All stents proved patent and no patient required another liver transplantation.Angiography plays an important role in diagnosing hepatic artery complications after liver transplantation. Interventional therapy is a valuable method in the treatment of acute hepatic artery occlusion after liver transplantation.
