Renal dysfunction predicts long-term mortality in patients with lower extremity arterial disease. Patients with renal insufficiency tend to suffer from advanced atherosclerosis and exhibit a reduced life expectancy.This prospective study investigated the relation between renal dysfunction and long-term all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in a population of nonsurgical patients with lower extremity arterial disease (LEAD).A total of 357 patients with symptomatic LEAD underwent baseline glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimation by the 4-variable Modification Diet in Renal Diseases equation, and were then followed for 4.2 years (range: 1-17).During follow-up, 131 patients died (8.6 deaths per 100 patient-years), 79 of whom (60%) from cardiovascular causes. All-cause death rates were 3.8, 6.6, and 15.5 per 100 patient-years, respectively, in the groups with normal GFR, mild reduction in GFR (60-89 mL min(-1) per 1.73 m2) and chronic kidney disease (CKD <60 mL min(-1) per 1.73 m2Chronic kidney disease strongly predicts long-term mortality in patients with symptomatic LEAD irrespective of disease severity, cardiovascular risk factors and concomitant treatments.
