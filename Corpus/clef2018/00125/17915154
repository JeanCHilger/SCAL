Peripheral artery disease: pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment. Peripheral artery disease is one of the most prevalent conditions, and it frequently coexists with vascular disease in other parts of the body. Early diagnosis is important for improving the patient's quality of life and for reducing the risk of serious secondary vascular events such as acute myocardial infraction (AMI) or stroke. The best noninvasive measure for identifying the presence of occlusive arterial disease is the ankle-brachial index, which can also be used to indicate the prognosis of the affected extremity and to predict the likelihood of AMI during follow-up. Intermittent claudication in the lower limbs is the most common clinical presentation. The presence of critical ischemia (i.e., with rest pain or trophic changes) indicates the need for prompt revascularization because of the high risk of limb amputation. The more proximal the affected arterial segment, the better the outcome of the procedure. Endovascular treatment is usually reserved for lesions affecting multiple segments. It gives poorer results in occluded arteries. In extensive disease, conventional surgery is usually the best option.
