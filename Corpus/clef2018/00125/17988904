Effect of proximal arterial occlusion on the progression of the distal arterial disease. To test the hypothesis that a proximal arterial occlusion has a protective effect on the progression of distal arterial disease, assessed by distal runoff resistance score (DRRS).One hundred and nineteen patients (median age 64 y, male 96%) with a unilateral iliac and/or femoral arterial occlusion caused by atherosclerosis were analyzed retrospectively. DRRS was assessed on arteriograms of the test limb (with proximal arterial occlusion) and control limb (contralateral limb). Multivariate analysis was performed to determine if a proximal arterial occlusion was an independent risk factor for the development of a difference in the DRRS between the test and control limbs.The clinical features of the subjects were claudication in 85%, ankle brachial index 0.52 (median), diabetes in 30% and smoker in 76%. The upper leg DRRS of the test limb was significantly lower in the iliac occlusion group than in the control limb (1.87+/-1.69 vs 2.85+/-2.75, p=0.032). However, multivariate analysis failed to identify any risk factors associated with the difference in DRRS in both limbs.There was no evidence that a proximal arterial occlusion was associated with a slower progression of distal arterial disease.
