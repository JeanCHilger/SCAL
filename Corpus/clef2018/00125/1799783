Angiographic assessment of arterial outflow: predictive value of a new classification system. A prospective study with 4 years of follow-up involving 127 consecutive symptomatic patients (60.6% with claudication, 39.4% with critical ischemia) who underwent aortobifemoral bypass surgery is described. A new grading system for the classification of arterial outflow was applied to determine its usefulness in predicting the outcome of surgery. Preoperative angiograms were numerically scored according to the arterial outflow status at the level of main segmental involvement. Higher scores corresponded to worse outflows. Outflow scores ranged between 1 and 10 with a mean of 3.6 +/- 0.24. The main comparison was between patients with scores of less than 5 (group A, n = 80) and patients with scores of 5 or more (group B, n = 47). Better outflow was associated with higher postoperative mean increases in the ankle-brachial index (ABI) (group A, 0.35 +/- 0.03 group B, 0.17 +/- 0.04
