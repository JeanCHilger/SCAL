Evaluation of blood flow in allograft renal arteries anastomosed with two different techniques. Renal artery stenosis in renal transplantation (TRAS) is an avoidable short or long-term surgical complication. The etiology is multifactorial, but faulty anastomosis is a major factor. In our transplant center, we evaluated the incidence of TRAS with the use of two different suturing techniques of the anastomosis site between the allograft renal and iliac arteries in two groups of renal transplant recipients, group A: 14 patients (6 males and 8 females with age 16 to 59 and mean age of 38 years) in whom the allograft arteries were anastomosed with a continuous suture technique, and group B: 14 patients (7 males and 7 females, with age 32 to 61 and mean age of 46.6 years) in whom the allograft arteries were anastomosed with a combined suture technique (continuous and interrupted). Post transplantation, the velocity of blood flow in the renal and iliac arteries at the site of anastomosis was measured by color Doppler ultrasound. The ultrasonographer was blinded to the surgical technique in both study groups. The ratio of the maximum velocity of blood at the site of anastomosis to that in the iliac artery of less than 2.5 was considered as non-significant stenosis, while a ratio of more than 2.5 was considered significant stenosis. In group A there were 9 cases of non-significant stenosis in comparison to 3 cases in group B, while there were no cases of significant stenosis in group A in comparison to 3 cases in group B the difference was not statistically significant. We conclude that there was no difference in the incidence of stenosis in the compared surgical techniques of anastomosis in our study groups. This suggests that other factors such as gentle handling of tissue, enough spatula, margin reversion, and comparable diameter of the anastomosed vessels may be more important in the prevention of renal allograft stenosis than the type of suture technique.
