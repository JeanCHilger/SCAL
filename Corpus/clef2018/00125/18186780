A simple Doppler echocardiography method to evaluate pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in patients with atrial fibrillation. The accuracy of E/E' ratio has not been validated in atrial fibrillation (AF). The objective of this study is to compare the accuracy of the E/E' ratio averaged over a sample of 10 cardiac cycles and E/E' ratio obtained in the cycle with the longest RR interval for the estimation of wedge pressure in patients with AF using a simultaneous pulmonary artery occlusive pressure measured with a Swan-Ganz catheter.Twenty-four consecutive patients with AF with a Swan-Ganz catheter were recruited in this study. The majority of patients (92%) were in the early postoperative phase of cardiac surgery.The best sensitivity and specificity was reached with E/E' ratio in the medial position using the one-beat method E/E' ratio > or = 16 with one beat predicts a wedge pressure >15 mmHg with a sensitivity and specificity of 91% and 85%, respectively.Measuring E/E' ratio using the one-beat method is a simple and clinically accurate way to estimate wedge pressure in patients with AF.
