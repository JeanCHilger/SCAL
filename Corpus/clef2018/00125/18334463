Serum lipoprotein(a) levels in patients with atherosclerotic peripheral vascular disease in Hospital Kuala Lumpur. The objective of this study was to determine the proportion of patients with atherosclerotic peripheral vascular disease (PVD) who had elevated lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] levels, as well as to determine the latter's significance as a risk factor for PVD in the local population.This case-controlled study was conducted between June and October 2004 in the Department of Surgery, Kuala Lumpur Hospital. A total of 100 patients were recruited and divided into control and PVD groups. Patients were defined as having PVD if they were symptomatic, with ankle-brachial systolic index < 0.90, or by radiological evidence. Lp(a) concentrations were determined using immunoturbidometry. Absorbance of reaction precipitate was measured by spectrophotometry to give Lp(a) concentration in grams per litre (g/L). The reference value for normal Lp(a) levels was < or = 0.36 g/L.Mean Lp(a) levels for control and PVD groups were 0.29 g/L and 0.56 g/L, and median values were 0.17 g/L and 0.48 g/L, respectively. Elevated Lp(a) levels in the control group was 26% compared to 58% in the PVD group. Analysis with Pearson's chi-squared test achieved a significant p value of 0.001. Multivariate analysis showed that elevated Lp(a) levels contributed significantly to the probability of having PVD with an odds ratio of 7.69.Elevated serum Lp(a) has a significant role as a risk factor for atherosclerotic PVD in the local population.
