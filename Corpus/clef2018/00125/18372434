The impact of peripheral arterial disease on health-related quality of life in the Peripheral Arterial Disease Awareness, Risk, and Treatment: New Resources for Survival (PARTNERS) Program. This study tested the hypothesis that patients with PAD have impaired health-related quality of life (HRQoL) to a degree similar to that of patients with other types of cardiovascular disease (other-CVD), and also evaluated the clinical features of PAD associated with impaired HRQoL. This was a cross-sectional study in 350 primary care practice sites nationwide with 6,499 participants. The reference group had no clinical or hemodynamic evidence of PAD or other-CVD the PAD group had an ankle-brachial index < 0.90 or a prior history of PAD
