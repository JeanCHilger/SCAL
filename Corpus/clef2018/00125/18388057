Elevated osteopontin levels in patients with peripheral arterial disease. This study was carried out to compare concentrations of osteopontin (OPN) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) in peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The study population consisted of 200 consecutive subjects in whom both OPN/OPG and ankle-brachial index were measured. It was found that OPN levels, but not OPG levels, were significantly more increased in patients with PAD than those without PAD. Serum OPN levels were significantly lower in subjects with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers than those without these agents. In this study, it has been demonstrated for the first time that serum OPN levels are related to PAD. Inhibition of renin- angiotensin system could decrease OPN levels and prevent the progression of PAD.
