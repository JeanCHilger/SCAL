Evaluation of the efficacy of propionyl-L-carnitine versus pulsed muscular compressions in diabetic and non-diabetic patients affected by obliterating arteriopathy Leriche stage II. The effectiveness of propionyl-L-carnitine (PLC) monotherapy regimen alone or in association with pulsed muscular compression was compared to the physical therapy by itself against obliterant arteriopathy Leriche Fontaine stage II. PLC is involved in cellular metabolism and is transformed into two active substances, free L-carnitine and propionyl-coenzyme A in the mitochondria, which take part in fatty acid transfer and in the citric acid cycle, respectively.Forty-two patients with arterial disease were selected (22 males and 20 females mean age: 62+/-8 yearsThe efficacy of both PLC and Vascupump in the treatment of the peripheral vasculopathies was confirmed. From a subjective point of view, patients referred benefits both in clinical terms, i.e. increased walking distance (average increaseaegroup I: DB 102%, NDB 118% group II: DB 94%, NDB 193%Combined pharmaco- and physical therapy was most efficient treatment regime and best results were seen in NDB compared to the DB patients.
