Hypertension in the aged: how to assess it?. In the elderly hypertensive patient several of the basic procedures during evaluation should be repeated or performed with particular care. Most importantly multiple pressure measurements should be taken repeatedly, orthostatic reactions have to be sought by taking the blood pressure in the standing and lying patient and the carotid vessels have to be auscultated. If a carotid occlusion or stenosis is suspected, a Doppler ultrasound study is indicated prior to therapy. Generalized arteriosclerosis is probably rarely the cause of so called pseudohypertension. It should be considered when strikingly high blood pressure values contrast with clinical signs of low blood pressure. Finally if hypertension develops rapidly in an elderly patient renal arterial stenosis should be suspected.
