Subintimal angioplasty: Our experience in the treatment of 506 infrainguinal arterial occlusions. The treatment of patients with chronic arterial occlusions involving the superficial femoral artery has changed significantly with the incorporation of subintimal angioplasty (SIA) into vascular surgery practice. To more clearly define technical feasibility, patency, and clinical outcomes of SIA, we reviewed our cumulative experience.A retrospective review of all patients who underwent SIA of arterial occlusions originating in the superficial femoral artery was performed. Patient history, demographics, procedural details, and follow-up information were collected and analyzed. Patency, limb salvage, sustained improvement in claudication, freedom from surgical bypass, and survival were determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis.From December, 2002, through July, 2006, 506 infrainguinal SIA procedures were performed in 472 patients with chronic arterial occlusion involving the superficial femoral artery. The mean age of patients treated was 69.4 +/- 11.9 years and the indication for intervention was critical limb ischemia in 63% of limbs (n = 317) and disabling claudication in 37% (n = 189). Forty-seven percent of limbs (n = 237) had isolated SFA occlusions, 40% (n = 205) had femoropopliteal occlusions, and 13% of limbs had occlusions beginning in the SFA and extending into the tibial arteries (n = 64). Technical success was achieved in 87% of procedures. Following successful SIA, the mean ankle-brachial index increased by 54%, from 0.50 +/- 0.16 to 0.77 +/- 0.23 (P < .0001). Median follow-up was 12.4 months (0-48 months) and 30-day mortality was 0.8%. Primary patency at 12 and 36 months was 45% (SE 3.0%) and 25% (SE 3.6%) respectively. Secondary patency was 76% (SE 2.6%) and 50% (SE 4.8%) at 12 and 36 months. Factors associated with reduced primary patency included femorotibial occlusions (HR 1.57, CI 1.05-2.36) and the presence of critical limb ischemia (HR 1.39, CI 1.02-1.89). Limb salvage in patients with critical limb ischemia was 75% (SE 5.9%) at 36 months. Freedom from surgical bypass in patients with either critical limb ischemia or disabling claudication was 77% (SE 4.1%) at 36 months.SIA is an effective percutaneous technique for the revascularization of patients with lower extremity chronic arterial occlusions involving the superficial femoral artery. The procedure is successfully performed in all segments of the lower extremity with minimal morbidity or mortality. Rates of limb salvage and improvement in claudication are similar to those achieved by open surgical bypass, while modest reductions in limb salvage and primary patency are experienced in limbs with femorotibial occlusions.
