Peripheral arterial disease and its clinical significance in nonagenarians. The purpose of this study was to characterize the prevalence and clinical features of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) among 90-year-old individuals and to assess its relationship to lower extremity functional status and survival over one year.A prospective, population- based study of all 90-year-old residents of Jyväskylä, Finland. Fifty-eight out of the 79 registered residents were examined for ankle-brachial index (ABI). Lower extremity functional status was assessed as self-reported difficulty in performing specific physical activities of daily living (PADL). In a subgroup of 36 individuals, lower extremity functioning was further assessed by measuring walking endurance and walking velocity. Death dates were collected for one year after the examination from the hospital register.Thirteen persons (22%) had an ABI<0.9. PAD was asymptomatic in 11 of them and the diagnosis of PAD new to 12 of them. Thirty (52%) subjects had a normal ABI (0.9-1.4) and in 15 (26%) cases the ABI was pathologically high (>1.4). A significant accumulation of cardiovascular risk factors was observed among those with an ABI<0.9 compared with those with normal or high ABI (2.0+/-0.8 vs 1.3+/-0.8 vs 1.5+/-0.5, p=0.03). Those with low or high ABI reported more difficulties in the PADL tasks than those with normal ABI, but the results did not reach statistical significance. No difference in maximal walking velocity was observed according to ABI in the subgroup with data available. After one year, nine people had died, of whom only two (7%) with normal ABI and seven with low or high ABI (25%) (p=0.05).PAD was found to be mainly asymptomatic among 90-year-old people. An abnormal ABI was also associated with increased mortality risk over a one-year follow-up. Although our study was small-scale, it does provide novel information about the prevalence of PAD and clinical significance of ABI in very old people.
