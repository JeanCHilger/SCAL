Anatomy and clinical application of bypass circuit outflow tract of arterial sclerosis obstruction. To evaluate the possibility of collateral outflow tract of arterial sclerosis obstruction (ASO) and the prospect of clinical application.The red emulsion was infused into the arteries of the above knee amputation of 10 fresh specimens. Then the pathological changes of the anterior tibial artery, posterior tibial artery and the popliteal artery, and the contribution of these bole artery branch were observed. From September 2005 to April 2007, 5 patients with ASO were treated, unilateral lower limb was involved in all cases. There were 3 males and 2 females, aged 68-81 years. The arteriography and Color Doppler ultrasound of lower limbs showed that the femoral artery and the popliteal artery and the branches had no development. The exploratory operation on the popliteal artery and the branches was carried out.The walls of the anterior tibial artery, posterior tibial artery, and the popliteal artery were stiff and the lumens were filled with atheromatous plaque. The sural arteries opening to the bole artery was frequent. The collateral circulation at the knee perimeter was raritan rather affluent at the muscle group. All of the operations were successful, the skin temperature increased gradually after operation, and the degrees of blood oxygen saturation increased to 90%-100% at 6 hours from 0 before operation. After a follow-up of 3 to 12 months, the symptom improved obviously, rest pain disappeared, lower limb ulcer healed. The Color Doppler ultrasound showed that most of the blood flow at the anastomotic stoma ejected into bypass circuit, and the blood flow at the distally posterior tibial artery and anterior tibial artery was little.The collateral outflow tract construction is feasible, it is an effective path after clinical verification to solve the advanced stage ASO.
