Relationship of cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) to carotid and coronary arteriosclerosis. The cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) has been recently reported as a new index of aortic stiffness, which is less influenced by blood pressure than pulse wave velocity (PWV). The present study investigated the relationship between the levels of CAVI and carotid and coronary arteriosclerosis.The 443 consecutive patients who underwent CAVI, carotid sonography, and coronary angiography in hospital were examined. Intima-media thickness (IMT) and carotid plaque were evaluated by ultrasonography. The severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) was evaluated by coronary angiography and the subjects were divided into 4 groups (0, no significant organic stenosis: 1, 1-vessel disease: 2, 2-vessel disease: 3, 3-vessel disease). Univariate analyses showed that both CAVI and brachial-ankle PWV (baPWV) were associated with IMT and the presence of carotid plaque. Multiple stepwise regression analyses revealed that CAVI (p=0.0427), but not baPWV, was associated with the IMT. Both CAVI (p<0.0001) and baPWV (p=0.0140) were significantly associated with the severity of CAD. Multiple logistic analyses revealed that CAVI (p=0.0342), but not baPWV (p=0.8027), was associated with the presence of multivessel disease.High CAVI implies progression of carotid and coronary arteriosclerosis. CAVI may be more closely linked with arteriosclerosis than baPWV.
