Infrainguinal atherectomy: a retrospective review of a single-center experience. By decreasing plaque burden, atherectomy provides an alternative to angioplasty and stenting as a means of revascularizing patients with peripheral arterial disease. A new atherectomy device (SilverHawk) has recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, but the results with its use are unclear. We analyzed a series of consecutive patients undergoing atherectomy. We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 35 patients undergoing infrainguinal (IF) atherectomy in 38 limbs. The Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) classification and Society of Vascular Surgery runoff scores were calculated. Time to event analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Risk factors affecting patency were analyzed with a multivariate Cox model. Mean patient age was 70 +/- 9.6 years. Indications for intervention were claudication (26%), rest pain (21%), and tissue loss (53%). Femoropopliteal (FP) atherectomy was performed in 68% and tibial atherectomy in 32%. For FP lesions, the TASC distribution was A, 42% B, 23%
