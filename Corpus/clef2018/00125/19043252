Angiotensin II type-I receptor blocker, candesartan, improves brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity independent of its blood pressure lowering effects in type 2 diabetes patients. Hypertension in diabetic patients has been shown to accelerate the progression of atherosclerosis and angiotensin II type-I (AT1) receptor blocker (ARB) has been shown to have anti-atherosclerosis action independent of its action on blood pressure.Type 2 diabetic patients with hypertension received either ARB (candesartan), or a calcium channel blocker (CCB amlodipine or nifedipine) for 12 weeks. Though clinical parameters such as blood glucose, HbA1c, and systolic and diastolic pressure were not significantly changed between the two groups, brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) was significantly reduced in the candesartan group when compared to CCB groups. Moreover, candesartan treatment exhibited a tendency of reduction in inflammation markers such as high sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6).We conclude that candesartan may improve vascular inflammation independent of its effect on hypertension in diabetes, thus suggesting its efficacy in diabetic patients.
