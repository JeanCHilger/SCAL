Skin blood flow and nitric oxide during body heating in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) often exhibit microvascular dysfunction that may contribute to impaired thermoregulation, but potential mechanisms remain unclear. Our goals were to quantify skin blood flow responses and nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation during body heating in individuals with T2DM compared with nondiabetic control subjects of similar age. We measured skin blood flow (laser-Doppler flowmetry) in conjunction with intradermal microdialysis of N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME nitric oxide synthase inhibitor) or vehicle during 45-60 min of whole body heating (WBH) in 10 individuals with T2DM and 14 control subjects. In six individuals from each group, we also measured forearm blood flow (FBF) by venous occlusion plethysmography on the contralateral forearm. FBF responses showed diminished absolute cutaneous vasodilation during WBH in the T2DM group (P(ANOVA) < 0.01
