Treatment of fibroids via uterine artery occlusion (uterine artery embolization and Doppler-guided uterine artery occlusion): potential role in today's armamentarium. Uterine fibroids, the most common benign tumors of the female reproductive system, are the most common indication for hysterectomy. However, this procedure is not the ideal treatment for many women including those who desire to preserve their fertility or simply do not want to undergo surgery. New technologies and surgical innovation provide treatments that are less associated with morbidity such as uterine artery embolization, magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound, and laparoscopic uterine artery occlusion. This manuscript will discuss the putative mechanism of action and clinical application of uterine artery occlusion using Doppler-guided Uterine Artery Occlusion, a new investigational treatment modality for uterine fibroids.
