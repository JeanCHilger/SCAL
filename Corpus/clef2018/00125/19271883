Effect of visual field locus and oscillation frequencies on posture control in an ecological environment. To examine the respective roles of central and peripheral vision in the control of posture, body sway amplitude (BSA) and postural perturbations (given by velocity root mean square or vRMS) were calculated in a group of 19 healthy young adults. The stimulus was a 3D tunnel, either static or moving sinusoidally in the anterior-posterior direction. There were nine visual field conditions: four central conditions (4, 7, 15, and 30 degrees) four peripheral conditions (central occlusions of 4, 7, 15, and 30 degrees)
