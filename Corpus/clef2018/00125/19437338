Differences in responses of platelets to fluid shear stress in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) and coronary artery disease (CAD). Information on differences in platelet function between patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) is limited. We sought to examine the differences in the platelets response to shear stress in patients with PAD compared to those with CAD. Men with symptomatic PAD (ankle brachial index [ABI] < 0.9 n = 29) were compared with similarly aged men with CAD (post coronary artery bypass grafting
