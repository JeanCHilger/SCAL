Bailout revascularization of chronic femoral artery occlusions with the new outback catheter following failed conventional endovascular intervention. To report the application of a true lumen re-entry device in the bailout treatment of chronic total occlusions (CTO) of the superficial femoral artery (SFA) after failed angioplasty.Nineteen patients (12 men mean age 81 years, range 61-97) with 20 SFA CTOs and Rutherford category 2 to 5 ischemia were prospectively evaluated. All CTOs had unsuccessful recanalization using conventional techniques and were subsequently treated with the Outback LTD catheter. Follow-up at 3, 6, and 12 months included ankle/toe pressure measurement and pulse volume recordings. Endpoints were revascularization rate, target lesion revascularization, and limb salvage.Revascularization was achieved in 95% of the cases. There were 2 (10%) periprocedural complications unrelated to the re-entry device, which were resolved by endovascular or surgical treatment. The target lesion revascularization rate was 10%, with the 2 events occurring at 3 and 6 months, respectively, in patients with Rutherford category 4-5 ischemia. There was one below-the-knee amputation in the patient with failed revascularization.The acute failure of endovascular treatment of SFA CTOs is most often due to an inability to re-enter the true lumen after the occlusion is crossed in a subintimal plane. Bailout revascularization with the Outback LTD catheter is highly successful and shows a low device-related complication rate. This needle- and fluoroscopic-based re-entry device increases the endovascular success rate and is therefore expanding the minimally invasive treatment options for surgically unfit patients.
