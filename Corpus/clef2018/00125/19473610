The relationship between n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and pulse wave velocity in diabetic and non-diabetic patients under long-term hemodialysis. A horizontal study. Diabetes mellitus (DM) and deficiency in n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFAs) are known to increase the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, it has not yet been reported whether n-3 LCPUFAs are related to arteriosclerosis in patients under long-term hemodialysis (HD).Pulse wave velocity from the brachium to the ankle (baPWV) was measured as a marker of arteriosclerosis with a volume-plethysmographic apparatus in 147 long-term HD patients (non-diabetic (non-DM): 51 males/42 females, 62 +/- 14 y and DM: 33 males/21 females, 67 +/- 9 y). The fatty acid composition of the total phospholipid fraction from washed RBCs was analyzed by gas chromatography. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, diastolic blood pressure, pulse, body mass index, duration of HD treatment, smoking status, LDL/HDL-cholesterol ratios and diabetes mellitus (DM).The mean baPWV was 18.9 +/- 5.2 and 23.7 +/- 6.3 m/s in non-DM and DM patients, respectively. The mean baPWV in DM patients was significantly higher than that of non-DM patients after adjustment (p = 0.0002). Multiple regression analysis showed that there was a significant inverse association between baPWV and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) levels (p = 0.017) and DHA/arachidonic acid (AA) ratios (p = 0.012) in RBC in non-DM patients after adjustment but not in DM patients.We suggest that n-3 LCPUFAs may be a negative risk factor of CVD also in non-DM HD patients. In DM patients the effects of n-3 PUFAs on the vascular system became undetectable probably because DM overwhelmingly affected PWV. Further studies in a prospective manner are necessary.
