Clinical features and coronary backgrounds of coexistent peripheral vascular disease in Japanese coronary artery disease patients. By use of noninvasive tests (Doppler segmental pressure study, supraorbital Doppler flow analysis, and segmental plethysmography), coexistent carotid (CTD) or lower extremity peripheral vascular disease (PVD) were diagnosed and correlated with subjective symptoms, coronary risk factors (CRFs), coronary arteriograms (CAGs), cardiac hemodynamics, and infarct size in 121 consecutive patients with documented coronary artery disease (CAD). PVD was found in 16.5%, CTD in 33.1%, and both PVD and CTD in 9.9% of the patients studied 20% of PVD patients and 47.5% of CTD patients were asymptomatic with respect to coexistent PVD or CTD. There were no significant differences between the presence or absence of PVD or CTD as regards number of CRFs, Killip classification, cardiac hemodynamics, or number of stenotic coronary arteries. However, serum creatine kinase (CK) and CKMB release curves in the PVD group showed significantly higher peak CK and peak CKMB values than those in the PVD(-) group (4096 +/- 5408/282 +/- 263 vs 1706 +/- 1715/179 +/- 186, p less than 0.05) because of the higher prevalence (100%) of multivessel disease on CAG. Investigation of the relationship of CRFs to coexistent PVD revealed that the smoking ratio in men (86.7%) and the hypertension ratio in women (80%) were extremely high in PVD patients, and statistically significant differences between PVD(+) patients and PVD(-) groups were found with respect to the obesity ratio (p less than 0.05) in men and the hypercholesterolemia ratio (p less than 0.05) and obesity ratio (60%, p less than 0.05) in women.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
