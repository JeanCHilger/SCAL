C-C chemokine receptor 2 expression by circulating monocytes influences atherosclerosis in patients on chronic hemodialysis. Mortality from cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease due to atherosclerosis is increased in patients on chronic hemodialysis. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and its receptor, C-C chemokine receptor 2, play an important role in recruiting monocytes to atherosclerotic lesions. The relationship between atherosclerosis in hemodialysis patients and C-C chemokine receptor 2 expression is unknown. Fifty-six patients on chronic hemodialysis and 27 age- and sex-matched controls were enrolled. Serum levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and expression of C-C chemokine receptor 2 by circulating monocytes were determined. Atherosclerosis was evaluated from the carotid intima-media thickness and cardio-ankle vascular index. Serum levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and expression of C-C chemokine receptor 2 by monocytes were significantly higher in the hemodialysis patients than the controls. Multiple regression analysis showed a positive correlation between receptor expression and both indexes of atherosclerosis.
