Chronic kidney disease has a more powerful impact on peripheral arterial disease than metabolic syndrome in Japanese type 2 diabetic patients. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and metabolic syndrome have been recognized as risk factors for cardiovascular disease. However, there is no information comparing their impact on macroangiopathy in diabetic patients. Thus, we studied the prevalence of CKD and metabolic syndrome in Japanese type 2 diabetic patients and then compared their impact on peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in type 2 diabetic patients.This study focused on Japanese type 2 diabetic patients without hemodialysis (n = 1014). Patients with albuminuria, including microalbuminuria and/or an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min/1.73(2), were diagnosed as having CKD. PAD was defined as ankle-brachial blood pressure index less than 0.9.The prevalence of CKD and metabolic syndrome was 47.1% and 39.6%, respectively. In four age- and duration-matched groups classified by the presence or absence of CKD and metabolic syndrome, the prevalence of PAD was significantly higher in groups with CKD alone than those with metabolic syndrome alone, and the high prevalence in the groups with CKD was not influenced by the coexistence with metabolic syndrome.This study indicates that CKD has more powerful impact on PAD than metabolic syndrome in type 2 diabetic patients.
