Anti-aging dock. Our anti-aging center (AAC) began providing health check-up services to local citizens in western Japan in February 2006, with the mission of promoting 'successful' aging through the employment of anti-aging check-ups, termed 'anti-aging dock' in Japan, using evidence-based 'anti-aging dock' strategies designed to diagnose atherosclerosis based on personal data. Clinical test items routinely received by most patients are as follows: 1) general physical measurement, 2) blood tests and urine analysis, 3) brain MRI/MRA, 4) carotid ultrasound imaging, 5) visceral fat area (VFA) estimation by abdominal CT, 6) brachial ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), 7) bone mineral density measurement, 8) stabilometer testing, 9) cognitive function testing, and 10) optional tests, including ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). Data from patients providing written informed consent has been used for research. As of December, 2008, the total number of patients has exceeded 1,000. About 50 participants (5%) were found to have cerebral aneurysm, as diagnosed using 3.0 tesla MRI. Of these, 10 patients required surgery, 7 in our hospital and 3 in an affiliated hospital. About 5% of participants were evaluated as probably having dementia in particular, three patients required treatment for Alzheimer disease. With regard to research, we have focused on the association between cerebral microbleeds and atherosclerotic disease, and the clinical implications of a high ankle-brachial index (ABI).
