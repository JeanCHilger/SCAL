Closure of the ductus arteriosus: determinant factor in the appearance of transient peripheral pulmonary stenosis of the neonate. We speculated that a relationship may exist between transient peripheral pulmonary stenosis and the closure of the ductus arteriosus. Fifty preterm infants had pulmonary artery and ductal color Doppler flow velocity assessments performed before and after closure of the ductus arteriosus. No flow turbulence or increase in velocity was observed immediately after birth, although a significant discrepancy in size was observed between the main pulmonary artery and its two branches. After closure of the ductus, 15 infants had signs of transient peripheral pulmonary stenosis of the left pulmonary artery in association with a significant decrease of diameter at the origin of the same artery. In all 50 infants, no significant gradient was observed in the right pulmonary artery. We conclude that, at least in the preterm infant, transient peripheral pulmonary stenosis is not present at birth but is an acquired phenomenon closely related to closure of the ductus arteriosus.
