Effects of physical exercise and indobufen in patients with intermittent claudication. Results after a 2-year follow-up. The study included 18 patients suffering from intermittent claudication before (stage 1) and after (stage 2) 3 months of rehabilitative training and after 2 years of follow-up (stage 3) during which patients undertook regular exercise (walking for 1 hour 3-4 days a week) and antiplatelet aggregating therapy with indobufen (200 mg x 2/day). A comparison of the data revealed that:a) there was a significant and gradual increase in the claudication pain distance (CPD) and maximal walking distance (MWD), and a reduced recovery time between stages 1 and 3 (parameters were assessed during and after walking on a treadmill (rolling mat) at a speed of 3.2 Km/h on a 12% slope) b) the resting ankle/arm pressure ratio was unchanged, but a significant increase was observed when the ratio was measured after exercise between stages 1 and 3
