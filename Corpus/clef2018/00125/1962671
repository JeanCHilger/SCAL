Noninvasive detection and monitoring of renal arteriovenous fistula by color Doppler. The diagnosis of a renal arteriovenous fistula is usually confirmed by angiography. Described is the utilization of color Doppler ultrasound to monitor a renal arteriovenous fistula before and after treatment by transcatheter steel coil embolization in a 63-year-old woman. Using color Doppler, the arteriovenous fistula with an aneurysmal lesion was clearly visualized. A pulsed-wave Doppler analysis showed increased flow velocity and decreased pulsatility in the supplying artery. After successful transcatheter occlusion of the fistula, these findings disappeared. The Doppler ultrasound technique is likely to be useful to detect and monitor a renal arteriovenous fistula noninvasively, simply, and quickly.
