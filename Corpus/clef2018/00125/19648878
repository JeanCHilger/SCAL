Interface pressure measurements at the thigh under eccentric compression (Mediven Post Op Kit). The use of a special foam pad for thighs under compression allows an increase in the interface pressure. The interface pressures obtained under one and two compression stockings (23 mmHg at the ankle) in the supine position are 10.7+/-2 mmHg and 19.1 mm+/-2.9 mmHg respectively without interposing a pad and 37.5+/-5 mmHg and 58.5+/-9 mmHg on the medial side of the thigh when interposing a special pad.
