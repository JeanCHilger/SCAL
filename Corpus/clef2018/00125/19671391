Renal artery stenosis--diagnosis and treatment. Screening for renal artery stenosis (RAS) should be restricted to patients with a high RAS risk. Captopril renography, computed tomography (CT)-angiography, magnetic resonance (MR)-angiography and ultrasound (US) Doppler can be used. Most patients should receive medical treatment. If predictive tests suggest a good outcome, revascularisation with percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) should be considered in patients with refractory hypertension, fibromuscular dysplasia, recurrent pulmonary oedema, bilateral renal artery stenosis or progressive azotaemia, and in patients with a narrow stenosis to a single kidney.
