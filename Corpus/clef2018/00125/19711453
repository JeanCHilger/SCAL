Intramuscular transplantation of G-CSF-mobilized CD34(+) cells in patients with critical limb ischemia: a phase I/IIa, multicenter, single-blinded, dose-escalation clinical trial. A number of preclinical studies have indicated the therapeutic potential of endothelial progenitor cells for vascular regeneration in ischemic diseases. A phase I/IIa clinical trial of transplantation of autologous CD34(+) cells, the endothelial and hematopoietic progenitor-enriched fraction, was performed in no-option patients with atherosclerotic peripheral artery disease or Buerger's disease with critical limb ischemia (CLI). CD34(+) cells were isolated from the G-CSF-mobilized apheresis product using a magnetic cell sorting system. CD34(+) cells (10(5)/kg, n = 6 5 x 10(5)/kg, n = 8
