Clinical and microcirculatory effects of transcutaneous CO2 therapy in intermittent claudication. Randomized double-blind clinical trial with a parallel design. This randomized, double blind trial determined the short and long-term clinical and hemodynamic vasodilator effects induced by percutaneous applications of natural CO2 gas in patients with moderate Fontaine stage II.62 patients with intermittent claudication (100-500 meters) were randomized to 18 consecutive days of CO2 treatment or placebo (air). The gas fluids were applied at a constant temperature of 30 degrees C on pre-humidified skin. The effects of the treatment were evaluated by total distance walked (primary criterion) and hemodynamic and microcirculatory findings. Patients also answered a quality of life questionnaire.The Strandness test showed a significant increase in total distance walked (+ 131 meters, 66% p = 0.001) and pain-free distance (+ 81 meters, 73%This study demonstrates that 18 consecutive days of percutaneous CO2 treatment significantly increases walking distance in patients with moderate intermittent claudication. This effect, which was associated with an increase in peripheral systolic pressure and pO2, is evidence of a better ability to withstand effort.
