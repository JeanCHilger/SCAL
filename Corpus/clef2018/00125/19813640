Advances in noninvasive measurement of ankle-brachial index. The key of Ankle-brachial index (ABI) measurement is the synchronous measurement of four limbs' systolic blood pressures. In this paper is analyzed the inadequacy of the modern blood pressure measurement technologies used in the ABI measurement process. Special emphasis is laid on the principles and characteristics of the double-layer cuffs technology. The research orientation, the existing problems, and the way toward improvement are discussed.
