DcR1 expression in endometrial carcinomas. The tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a member of the TNF family, which mediates apoptosis by the extrinsic pathway. Up-regulation of decoy receptors, DcR1 and DcR2, may result in diminished binding of TRAIL to their functional receptors. DcR1 expression was assessed in normal endometrial tissue (NE) and endometrial carcinoma (EC) samples by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). IHC was performed in two tissue microarrays one composed of 80 samples of NE and a second one constructed from paraffin-embedded blocks of 62 EC. For quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis, RNA was obtained from 19 NE and 28 EC samples using Trizol. mRNA expression of DcR1 was assessed with Taqman-based assays in an Abi-Prism 700 SDS. Results were correlated with stage, histological type, and grade. By IHC, cytoplasmic expression of DcR1 was frequently seen in NE (79.6%) and varied according to the menstrual cycle. Positive DcR1 immunostaining was also detected in EC (98.1% of the cases) without any specific statistical association with histological type, grade, and stage. By quantitative real-time PCR, all NE had similar levels of DcR1expression (0.8-1.7 RQ), which were considered the basal levels of DcR1 expression in NE. Increased DcR1 expression (> or =5-fold higher than the basal levels) was detected in 13 of 28 EC (46.4%). High DcR1 expression levels were found in ECs of different stages: IA, four of 12 (33%)
