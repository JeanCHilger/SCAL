Kinematical profiling of the front crawl start. This study analysed the start phases of 15 elite front crawl swimmers, all specialists of sprint events. The first aim was to determine which phases were correlated with the 15-m start time. The features common to the sample of swimmers were then established and individual profiles were clustered. The subjects performed two 25-m trials at the 50-m race-pace using their preferential start technique (grab start). The kinematical analysis assessed the durations of the block, flight, entry, glide, leg kicking and full swimming phases to the 15-m mark. Stroking parameters and the index of arm coordination (IdC) were analysed for the swimming part (10-20 m) of the 25-m. Through the swimming part IdC increased while stroke length and velocity decreased (p<0.05). The relative durations of the aerial (block, flight), entry and underwater phases were correlated with start time. Inter-subject variability was observed, which suggests that various motor solutions were used for the start. Notably, four clusters led to a short 15-m start time: the leg kicking style, mixed "leg kicking/swimming" style, long glide style and short glide style.
