Frequency, characteristics and risk factors of carotid artery stenosis in ischaemic stroke patients at Civil Hospital Karachi. To determine the frequency and characteristics of carotid artery stenosis in acute ischaemic stroke patients and to assess the significance of common risk factors for carotid stenosis in these patients.One hundred consecutive patients admitted with acute ischaemic stroke were included in the study. The relevant history, physical examination and laboratory investigations were done as per the Performa. Doppler ultrasound was performed during the hospitalization to find out carotid artery stenosis. Statistics analysis was done with SPSS v 14.Out of one hundred (100) patients, sixty one (61%) were males and thirty nine (39%) were females. Thirty nine patients (39%) were found to have carotid artery stenosis, all of them on the ipsilateral side corresponding to the ischaemic lesion. Eleven (11) of these patients had stenosis on the contra lateral side as well. The presence of stenosis was significantly correlated with older age and the presence of multiple risk factors. Majority (52%) of the lesions were severe to critical as determined by Doppler peak systolic velocity. Fifty nine (59%) were non calcified.Carotid artery stenosis is strongly associated with ischaemic stroke. Doppler studies are recommended for the high risk patients for the primary as well as secondary prevention of ischaemic stroke.
