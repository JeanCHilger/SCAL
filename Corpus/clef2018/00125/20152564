Evaluation of cuff-induced ischemia in the lower extremity by magnetic resonance oximetry. The aim of this study was to evaluate vascular function in the lower extremities by making direct time-course measurement of oxygen saturation in the femoral/popliteal arteries and veins during cuff-induced reactive hyperemia with magnetic resonance imaging-based oximetry.Magnetic resonance imaging-based oximetry is a new calibration-free technique taking advantage of the paramagnetic nature of blood that depends on the volume fraction of deoxyhemoglobin in red blood cells.We compared post-occlusive blood oxygenation time-course of femoral/popliteal vessels in: 1) young healthy subjects (YH) (n = 10 mean ankle-brachial index [ABI] 1.0 +/- 0.1, mean age 30 +/- 7 years)Significantly longer washout time (42 +/- 16 s vs. 14 +/- 4 s p < 0.0001) and lower upslope (0.60 +/- 0.20 %HbO(2)/s vs. 1.32 +/- 0.41 %HbO(2)/sPost-occlusive transient changes in venous blood oxygenation might provide a new measure of vascular competence, which was found to be reduced in subjects with abnormal ABI, manifesting in prolonged recovery during the early phase of hyperemia.
