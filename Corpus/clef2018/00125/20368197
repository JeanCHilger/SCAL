Prevalence and risk factors for peripheral artery disease in an Asian population with diabetes mellitus. We describe the prevalence and risk factors for PAD in Asian Malays with diabetes. A population-based study of 3,280 (78.7% response) Malay persons aged 40-80 years in Singapore was conducted. ABI was measured in all participants with a history of diabetes (N=634). PAD was defined to be present if ABI <or= 0.9. All participants had standardised interviews, clinical examinations and laboratory investigation for risk factor assessment. The crude prevalence of PAD was 10.4% (95% CI: 8.3%-13.0%). After age standardisation to the 2000 Singapore Census population, the prevalence was 5% (95% CI: 3.8-8.6). In multivariate analyses, the presence of PAD was associated with older age (OR 1.05 95% CI: 1.01-1.09, per year increase), female gender (OR 4.18
