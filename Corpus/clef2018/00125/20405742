Revascularization of the limbs in patients of elderly and senile age with chronic arterial ischemia. The results of examination and treatment of about 3000 patients having chronic arterial ischemia of extremities allowed to define three main types of arterial diseases appearing in arterial ischemia of extremities of different degrees of manifestation: spastic arterial diseases, obliterating diseases and mixed types, combining spasms and arterial obliteration. In case of spastic arterial diseases ischemia is to be treated conservatively. Biosurgical revascularization of extremities having practically no contraindications is recommended in case of obliterating arterial diseases with critical arterial ischemia of extremities, when surgical generally accepted methods have a short-term treatment effect or their application is impossible, in case of peripheral form of arterial affection and also for acute associated diseases of middle-aged and old patients. Mixed arterial ischemia is revealed as a rule for middle-aged and old patients. Biosurgical revascularization and conservative treatment methods were applied for their treatment. The paper is devoted to the treatment of middle-aged and old patients having obliterating arterial diseases of extremities with a clinical presentation of chronic arterial ischemia.
