Non-invasive diagnosis of coronary-subclavian steal: role of the Doppler ultrasound. Coronary subclavian steal syndrome (CSSS) is a well documented cause of graft function failure in patients after left internal mammary artery (LIMA)--left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery grafting. We present a case of the CSSS in a patient with cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation. To our knowledge such a case has not yet been described. Patient with a history of LIMA-LAD grafting, complaining only of a mild chronic exertional dyspnoea developed ventricular fibrillation while walking outdoor. After successful resuscitation, blood pressure difference between both arms and abnormal LIMA flow with systolic reversal flow on the Doppler ultrasonography were suggestive of CSSS. Angiography proved the left subclavian artery (LSA) occlusion and coronary angiography confirmed reversal flow in the LIMA graft. Successful percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the LSA re-established normal LIMA flow and improved the left ventricular hypokinesis and systolic function.
