Manifestation of lower extremity atherosclerosis in diabetic patients with high ankle-brachial index. The ankle brachial index (ABI) is a simple, inexpensive, noninvasive tool that correlates well with angiographic disease severity and functional symptoms. The aim of this study was to identify the manifestation of lower extremity atherosclerotic lesions in patients with high ABI by retrospective clinical study.A cohort of 184 diabetic patients, (63 +/- 14) years old, 144 males, who underwent simultaneously ABI testing and low extremity arterial duplex ultrasound within one week, were enrolled randomly into this study. According to the ABI value, they were divided into three groups: the high, normal and low ABI groups. The severity and location of atherosclerotic lesions in the lower extremity were determined based on the results of low extremity artery duplex ultrasound. The chi-square test was used to compare the atherosclerosis severity grade and lesion location across the three groups.The prevalence of low extremity artery occlusion was significantly lower in the high ABI group than in the low ABI group (3.3% vs. 63.5%, P < 0.01), and the main atherosclerotic lesions were diffuse dot-like hyperechogenicity spots or small plaques (86.7%). In addition, the atherosclerotic lesions were mostly found in the distal segment of the lower extremity in patients with high ABI (46.3%).A high ABI may be an integrative marker for intimal and medial calcification, which has a high positive predictive value for artery calcification.
