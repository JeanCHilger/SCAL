Mid-term clinical outcome and predictors of vessel patency after femoropopliteal stenting with self-expandable nitinol stent. Long-term clinical outcomes after femoropopliteal (FP) stenting with nitinol stents have not yet been clear. We investigated the mid-term efficacy of FP stenting with nitinol stents.This study was a multicenter retrospective study. From April 2004 to December 2008, 511 consecutive patients (639 limbs mean age 71 +/- 7 yearsSixty-one percent of the patients had diabetes, 76% were claudicant, and 20% were on hemodialysis. Mean lesion length was 151 +/- 75 mm. Mean follow-up period was 22 +/- 11 months. Primary patency was 79.8%, 66.7%, and 63.1%, and secondary patency was 90.4%, 87.3%, and 86.2% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. During the follow-up period, 53 patients (10%) died. Of them, cardiovascular death was 38% and stent fracture had occurred in 14%. On multivariate analysis by Cox proportional hazard ratio, cilostazol administration (hazard ratio [HR], 0.52P < .0001), stent fracture (HR, 1.6Clinical efficacy of nitinol stent implantation for FP disease was favorable for up to 5 years.
