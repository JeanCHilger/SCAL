Management of patients with peripheral arterial disease in primary care: a cross-sectional study in Germany. Studies in the primary care setting are of high interest for assessing the management situation of patients with manifestations of atherothrombosis.Therefore, we documented diagnostic procedures, characteristics, and management of patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD).Prospective cross-sectional study in primary care practices throughout Germany.A total of 671 patients with newly diagnosed PAD were included (mean age 69.1 years 62.1% men). Cardiovascular risk factors were highly prevalent in the total PAD group: arterial hypertension in 84.2%, hyperlipidaemia in 75.5%, present smoking in 45.0% and diabetes mellitus in 47.3%. Atherothrombotic comorbidities were also frequent: coronary artery disease in 44.9% and cerebrovascular disease in 28.1%. For confirmation of diagnosis, patients were referred to specialists in 66.9% of cases. Overall, ankle brachial index was measured in 89.0%, and a clinical PAD score assessed in 66.6% (agreement of both measures with Cohen's kappa only, kappa = 0.039Our findings confirm that patients with PAD pose a substantial challenge to physicians because of their high number of comorbidities. Compared with previous studies, management of such patients appears to have improved.
