Research and clinical application of new type instrument for measuring artery elastic function. According to the pulse-wave theory, the authors developed a new non-invasive instrument for measuring arterial elastic function. It collects the pulse waveforms from the arteries of four limbs as well as from the radial arteries of carpus. After signal pre-processing, it calculates the arterial elastic parameters by the pre-prepared algorithm and program. Individual parameters such as pulse wave velocity (PWV), ankle-brachial index (ABI), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR)can be obtained. At the same time, a series of clinical trials were conducted with reference to PWV and ABI, which confirmed the validity, accuracy and reliability of the instrument. The instrument can be used to determine the differences between cardiovascular patients and normal persons, as well as the extent of atherosclerosis. At the same time it can reflect the situation of vascular obstruction and screen the peripheral arterial disease. Therefore, it is of some value to the epidemiological study, prevention and early detection of cardiovascular disease.
