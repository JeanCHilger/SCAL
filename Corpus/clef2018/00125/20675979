Peripheral artery disease and genetics: is there a cause-and-effect relationship? Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a major health problem worldwide, affecting millions of patients. Although cardiovascular risk factors, such as diabetes, tobacco use, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia have been associated with the development of PAD, the possible existence of an inherited genetic predisposition to PAD has been investigated in numerous familial aggregation studies. A link between genetics and PAD may open new avenues for the prevention of this morbid and mortal disorder. This is an overview of the potential association between genetics and PAD.
