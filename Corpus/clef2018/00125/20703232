Head-to-head comparison of the cardio-ankle vascular index between patients with acute coronary syndrome and stable angina pectoris. We aimed to evaluate whether there was a difference in the arterial stiffness assessed by the cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) between patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and those with stable angina pectoris (SAP). A total of 199 consecutive patients, 79 with ACS and 120 with SAP, who underwent emergency or elective coronary revascularization were enrolled. The CAVI was measured within 2 days after the procedures, and was compared between the ACS and SAP patients. As parameters related to arteriosclerosis, carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and number of stenotic coronary vessels were also evaluated. Although IMT was significantly greater in SAP patients (2.1±1.1 vs. 2.4±0.9 P=0.022), CAVI was significantly higher in ACS patients (10.0±1.7 vs. 9.3±1.3
