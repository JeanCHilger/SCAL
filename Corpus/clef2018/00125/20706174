Central retinal vessel blood flow after surgical treatment for central retinal vein occlusion. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of radial optic neurotomy and retinal endovascular surgery on retinal blood flow velocity in patients with central retinal vein occlusion.A prospective interventional case series.Six patients with a central retinal vein occlusion of <12 months' duration were included. Three patients were treated with radial optic neurotomy and three with retinal endovascular surgery. Five patients had decreased central venous blood flow velocity compared with the fellow eye, and one patient had similar central venous blood flow in both eyes at baseline. All study eyes had decreased central venous blood flow velocity compared with the fellow eye at 24 weeks after treatment. Two patients had a further decrease in central venous blood flow during the study. Three patients had no minimal change in central venous blood flow, and 1 patient showed a minimal increase from 3 cm/s at baseline to 4 cm/s 24 weeks after surgery.Radial optic neurotomy and retinal endovascular surgery do not alter central retinal blood flow velocity. The place of these therapies in the treatment for central retinal vein occlusion should be questioned.
