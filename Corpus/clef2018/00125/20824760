Percutaneous transluminal renal stenting for transplant renal artery stenosis. Renal transplantation is a well-accepted therapeutic option for patients with end stage renal disease. Renal artery stenosis occurring in a transplanted kidney is a potentially serious condition and adversely affects graft survival and prognosis. The objective of this study is to document the immediate and intermediate term clinical results of renal stenting in this rare subset of renal artery stenosis.There is limited data about the effectiveness of renal stenting in transplant renal artery stenosis.Eight patients, aged between 22 and 51 (42.5 ± 9.25) years, were referred to our tertiary care interventional cardiology services for renal intervention. The diagnosis of transplant renal artery stenosis was based on clinical presentation (uncontrolled hypertension (n = 4, 50%), worsening renal function (n = 3, 37.5%) or flash pulmonary oedema (n = 1, 12.5%)] and Doppler ultrasound.All patients had live donor renal transplant using end to end anastomosis 2 to 11 (6.25 ± 3.24) months prior to intervention. Angiography revealed discrete stenosis at the anastomotic site. Intrarenal stenting performed from femoral access using 6 F accessories produced excellent angiographic results. There were no access site or procedure related complications. The intervention produced excellent immediate and intermediate term clinical results. In three patients, there was stabilization of renal function during 62 ± 9.16 months of follow-up with decrease in serum creatinine by 38.86 ± 6.62 % P = 0.0476. In four patients with refractory hypertension, excellent blood pressure control was achieved with a reduction in mean blood pressure by 25.95 ± 5.48 mm Hg (from 122.4 ± 5.7 to 96.45 ± 2.45 mm HgPercutaneous renal stenting provides excellent angiographic and clinical results sustained at intermediate term follow-up in patients with symptomatic transplant renal artery stenosis.
