Relation between retinol, retinol-binding protein 4, transthyretin and carotid intima media thickness. Retinol is transported in a complex with retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) and transthyretin (TTR) in the circulation. While retinol is associated with various cardiovascular risk factors, the relation between retinol, RBP4, TTR and carotid intima media thickness (IMT) has not been analysed yet.Retinol, RBP4 and TTR were measured in 96 individuals and their relation to mean and maximal IMT was determined.Mean IMT correlated with RBP4 (r=0.335, p<0.001), retinol (r=-0.241, p=0.043), RBP/TTR ratio (r=0.254, p=0.025) and retinol/RBP4 ratio (r=-0.549, p<0.001). Adjustment for age, sex, BMI, blood pressure, HDL/total cholesterol ratio, triglyceride, diabetes and smoking revealed that the retinol/RBP4 ratio was strongly and independently associated with mean IMT. Similar results were found for maximal IMT, which included the measurement of plaques.The data support that the transport complex of vitamin A is associated with the IMT, an established parameter of atherosclerosis. Changes in RBP4 saturation with retinol may link renal dysfunction and insulin resistance to atherosclerosis.
