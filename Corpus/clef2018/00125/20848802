Digital subtract arteriographic (DSA) characteristics of lower extremities and ankle-brachial index in patients with diabetic feet. To evaluate the Digital Subtract Arteriography (DSA) characteristics of lower limb arterial diseases in patients with diabetic feet and to explore the correlation between DSA and Ankle-brachial index (ABI).Fifty-two patients with diabetic feet were recruited in this study. ABI and DSA of bilateral lower extremities were examined to assess the severity of vasculopathy. The relationship between ABI and DSA was analyzed.ABI values for 91 lower extremities were obtained, with a mean of 0.73 +/- 10.43 (0.15-1.97), among which 19.8% ranged from 0.9 to 1.3, 69.2% were less than 0.9, and 11% were more than 1.3. Based on the integrated angiographic images, the arteries with < or = 50% degree of stenosis, 50%-99% degree of stenosis and occlusion comprised 49.5%, 22%, and 28.5% for femoral artery 79.1%, 14.3%, and 6.6% for popliteal arteryArterial diseases of lower extremities in patients with diabetic feet are wide-spread, ranging from femoral artery to the dorsal pedis artery. Multiple segments of arteries are involved. Severe stenosis and occlusion are more common in anterior and posterial tibial arteries, and peroneal artery.
