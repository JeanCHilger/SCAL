Prehypertension is associated with atherosclerosis in Type 2 diabetes. Prehypertension is a risk factor for hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. However, the association between prehypertension and atherosclerosis in Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has not been evaluated. In the present study, we investigated the impact of prehypertension on atherosclerosis in T2DM.Patients (n=930) with T2DM were recruited for the present study from the outpatient clinic of Shanghai Ruijin Hospital. The intima-media thickness (IMT) of the common carotid artery (CCA) was determined using ultrasound and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) was determined by volume plethysmography to assess atherosclerosis.Of the 930 patients with T2DM (mean age of 59 years), 167 were categorized as normotensive, 213 were prehypertensive, and 550 were hypertensive. Diabetic subjects with prehypertension had significantly higher CCA-IMT and baPWV than those with normal blood pressure after adjustment for age and gender. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that, compared with normotension, prehypertension was a significant independent determinant of atherosclerosis (for maximum IMT ≥1.1 mm, odds ratio (OR) 2.10 and 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28-3.44 for baPWV ≥1400 cm/s, OR 3.09 and 95% CI 1.78-5.36).Prehypertension is associated with atherosclerosis independent of conventional cardiovascular risk factors in T2DM patients. We speculate that maintenance of systolic blood pressure <120 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure <80 mmHg may reduce the risk of atherosclerosis in T2DM.
