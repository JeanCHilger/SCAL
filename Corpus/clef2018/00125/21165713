Target organ damage in a population at intermediate cardiovascular risk, with adjunctive major risk factors: CArdiovascular PREvention Sacco Study (CAPRESS). The objective of the study is to assess the prevalence of target organ damage (TOD) at carotid, cardiac, renal and peripheral vascular levels in a population at intermediate cardiovascular risk, with adjunctive major risk factors (AMRF). From March 2007 to July 2009 we examined 979 subjects at intermediate cardiovascular risk, as indicated by the Italian algorithm "Progetto Cuore" the patients were aged 40-69 years, sensitized by one or more AMRF such as family history for cardiovascular disease (CVD), being overweight or obese, and smoking habit (more than 10 cigarettes/day). We measured common carotid intima-media thickness (cc-IMT) and plaque at any level, left ventricular mass index (LVMI), urine albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR), and ankle-brachial index (ABI). The prevalence of at least one TOD was 63% (617 subjects), cc-IMT was high in 48.2% (472), UACR abnormal in 14.1% (138), LVMI high in 12.6% (117) and ABI pathological in 9.1% (89). In those with carotid damage 423 had a plaque, amounting to 43.2% of the total population. Of note, carotid damage was present in all subjects with 3 TODs, and in 92% of subjects with 2 TODs. A multivariate logistic regression model including conventional factors and AMRF indicated that age 50-69 years, systolic blood pressure, relevant smoking and CV risk score ≥15 were independently and significantly associated with at least one TOD, and at least, with carotid damage. Among the AMRF, peripheral arterial disease was associated with relevant smoking, with an odds ratio (OR) of 3 [confidence interval (CI) 1.80-4.97, p < 0.0001]
