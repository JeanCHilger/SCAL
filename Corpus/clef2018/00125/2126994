Bilateral aortoiliac pressure measurements from a single puncture site. Bilateral aortoiliac pressure measurements were obtained at the time of aortography by performing contralateral iliac artery catheterization in 102 patients with peripheral vascular disease. Patients studied had mild-to-moderate aortoiliac disease and in their cases the additional information was believed to be important in therapeutic decision making. Patients with severe ulcerative disease, peripheral thromboembolism, and significant aortic aneurysms were excluded. Pressure gradients out of proportion to the degree of stenosis as measured on the arteriograms were frequently found, particularly during high flow states with intraarterial injections of a vasodilator. There were two failures of catheterization and three minor complications, none embolic. We conclude that contralateral iliac artery catheterization in selected patients is both safe and generally easily performed by experienced angiographers.
