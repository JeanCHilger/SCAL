Prevention of reocclusion by MCI-9038, a thrombin inhibitor, following t-PA-induced thrombolysis in a canine model of femoral arterial thrombosis. We compared a selective thrombin inhibitor (MCI-9038 Argatroban), a thromboxane A2 (TXA2) receptor antagonist (L-670,596) and a serotonin-2 receptor antagonist (ketanserin) for their ability to hasten clot lysis and delay reocclusion in a canine model of femoral arterial thrombosis. Occlusive thrombosis was induced by insertion of a thrombogenic copper coil. Femoral arterial blood flow velocity (FABFV) was monitored directly and continuously by Doppler flowmetry. Thrombolysis was induced with tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA
