The circulatory influence on development of age-related macular degeneration and hearing and equilibrium impairments. This study attempts to answer the question if any level of head and neck circulation takes a part in development of Age-Related Macular Degeneration (ARMD) and hearing and equilibrium impairments. Condition of large blood vessels was examined by Color-Doppler ultrasound, and carotid and ophthalmic arteries were included. The microcirculatory changes were examined directly by fundus photography and fluorescein angiography and indirectly testing hearing and equilibrium. The study group included 40 patients (21 females, 19 males) aging from 53 to 84 years with different stages of ARMD. The control group included 40 patients (18 females, 22 males) aging from 51 to 82 years without ARMD. Patients were inhabitants of Primorsko-Goranska County. There was no relationship between ARMD and condition of large blood vessels because significant stenosis of carotid arteries was found in 2 patients (5%) in study group and 3 patients (7.5%) in the control group (p > 0.05). On the contrary, we found correlation between ARMD and hearing (p = 0.0127) and equilibrium impairments (p = 0.0242). Fluorescein angiograms shows raised number of ischemic retinal capillaries in patients with ARMD (p = 0.0053). Results lead to conclusion that circulatory disorders on microcirculatory level take a great part in development of ARMD and hearing and equilibrium impairments in the elderly. The key is damage of sensory cells of the retina and inner ear caused by microcirculatory disorders. Interesting data was noticed that 9 patients with more serious ARMD on one side of head had greater hearing loss on the same side. If we find a new treatment for microcirculatory disorders, maybe we can treat both sensory impairments in earlier stage.
