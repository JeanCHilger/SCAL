Is percutaneous transluminal angioplasty better than exercise for claudication? Preliminary results from a prospective randomised trial. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is a commonly performed procedure for the treatment of intermittent claudication despite the lack of controlled studies. The aim of this study was to compare PTA with supervised exercise therapy for patients with arterial occlusive disease judged suitable for PTA at angiography. Patients were assessed before treatment commenced and at three monthly intervals afterwards. Assessment included measurement of resting ankle brachial pressure indices (ABPI), and claudicating and maximum walking distances on a treadmill up a 10 degrees incline. Twenty patients were randomised to receive PTA and 16 exercise. The groups were similar in age, sex, smoking habits and arteriographic pattern of disease. In the PTA group two patients had angioplasties that were technically unsuccessful and two other patients subsequently required surgery. One patient in the exercise group subsequently had a PTA. After PTA, mean ABPI were significantly improved at 3, 6 and 9 months (P less than 0.01) without a corresponding significant increase in mean maximum walking distances. However in the exercise group despite no increase in mean ABPI, mean maximum walking distances increased progressively, with significant increases at 6, 9 and 12 months (P less than 0.01).
