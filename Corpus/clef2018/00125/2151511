Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for ischaemic arterial disease of the lower extremities. We attempted percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in 43 patients with limb-threatening ischaemia (rest pain, nonhealing ulcer or gangrene) or lifestyle-limiting claudication. Of the 51 lesions dilated, 31 were in iliac, 12 in femoral, 6 in popliteal and 2 in tibial arteries. Overall primary success rate was 90.2 percent (46/51) 96.8 percent (30/31) in iliac, 83.3 percent (10/12) femoral, 66.7 percent (4/6) popliteal and 100 percent (2/2) in tibial arteries. Marked relief of ischaemic symptoms and increase in ankle-arm pressure index from 0.45 +/- 0.14 to 0.94 +/- 0.23 (P less than 0.005) were seen in the 39 patients with initial technical success. Three (6.9%) patients had minor complications. On 1-33 (mean 13.4 +/- 7.5) months follow up, 89.5 percent patients showed continued clinical improvement as well as improvement in noninvasive parameters of lower limb perfusion. We conclude that angioplasty of iliac, femoral, popliteal and tibial arteries is a highly effective and safe procedure to revascularize the ischaemic lower extremity.
