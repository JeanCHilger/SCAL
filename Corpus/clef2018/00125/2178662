Recent trends in the diagnosis and management of chronic intestinal ischemia. This paper reviews the operative management over the past 27 years of 102 patients with chronic mesenteric ischemia, and summarizes recent clinical trends and ongoing research in this area. The most important trends in the diagnosis and management of chronic intestinal ischemia include: (1) increasing use of duplex ultrasound scanning in the initial evaluation of patients with possible intestinal angina (2) rapidly evolving noninvasive clinical tests to assess mucosal perfusion (reflectance spectrophotometry, laser Doppler flow analysis, and tonometry)
