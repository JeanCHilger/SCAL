Ankle-brachial index and ventricular hypertrophy in arterial hypertension. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) is a marker of peripheral arterial disease. Very few reports have correlated this index with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), functional capacity (FC) and Framingham risk score (FRS). The objective of this study was to verify the correlation between ABI, LVH, FC and FRS in men with arterial hypertension (AH). Prospective and cross-sectional study of male patients (n = 40) with a mean age of 57.92 ± 7.61 years and no cardiovascular complications. This population was submitted to ABI measurements, echocardiography (ECHO), exercise test (ET) and laboratory tests. The ABI (right and left) was considered abnormal when the ratio between the highest mean systolic pressures of the ankles and arms was 0.9 or higher than 1.3 mmHg. LVH was identified by transthoracic ECHO and the FC by the ET. Peripheral blood samples were collected to calculate the FRS. Normal ABI values were observed in 33 patients (82.5%), who were included in Group I seven patients (17.5%) with abnormal ABI constituted Group II. Left ventricular mass index (LVMI) at the ECO were 111.18 ± 34.34 g/m(2) (Group I) and 150.29 ± 34.06 g/m(2) (Group II) (p = 0.009). The prevalence of LVH was 4% (Group I) and 35.3% (Group II) (p = 0.01), demonstrating a significant difference between the groups. As for the FC in ET, there was no difference between the groups. Regarding the FRS, the mean in Group I was below that in Group II: 13.18 ± 2.11 versus 15.28 ± 1.79 (p = 0.019). In hypertensive patients, the presence of LVH defined by the LVMI was more frequent in cases with abnormal ABI, identifying a higher cardiovascular risk.
