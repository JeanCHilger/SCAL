Pulse-wave analysis of optic nerve head circulation is significantly correlated with brachial-ankle pulse-wave velocity, carotid intima-media thickness, and age. To determine whether there is a significant correlation between the pulse-wave analysis in the optic nerve head circulation determined by laser speckle flowgraphy (LSFG), and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPVW), carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), and age.Thirty-three patients who visited the Vascular Function Section in our hospital were included. Age was 57.3 ± 12.6 years, with a range from 29 to 80 years. baPVW, carotid IMT, and pulse wave analysis in optic nerve head circulation using LSFG were conducted on subjects, and this parameter is named blowout time (BOT). The following items were analyzed as other systemic parameters: age, blood pressure, pulse pressure, heart rate, body mass index, and mean arterial blood pressure other ocular parameters were intraocular pressure and ocular perfusion pressure. Pearson's correlation coefficients were used to determine the relationship between the BOT, baPWV, IMT, age, and other parameters. In addition, multiple regression analysis was used to determine independent factors for age.BOT was significantly correlated with age (r = -0.85, P <0.0001), pulse pressure (r = -0.36, P = 0.04), baPWV (r = -0.72, P <0.0001), and IMT (r = -0.64, P < 0.0001). The result of multiple regression analysis showed that baPWV (odds ratio = 0.93, 95% confidence interval = 0.03-1.82 P = 0.04) and BOT (-2.26, -3.27 to -1.26, <0.0001) were independent contribution factors to age.Our results confirmed measurements of BOT in the optic nerve head can be a useful method for determinin g whether early atherosclerotic changes are present in the optic nerve head circulation.
