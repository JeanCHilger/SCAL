Variance of mean platelet volume in subjects with normal glucose tolerance, impaired glucose regulation and type 2 diabetic mellitus and its relationship with diabetic peripheral artery disease. To explore the variance of mean platelet volume (MPV) in subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), impaired glucose regulation (IGR) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and risk factors of MPV changes and analyze the relationship between MPV and diabetic peripheral artery disease (PAD).A total of 173 subjects were enrolled into this observational cross-sectional study. They were divided into 3 groups: NGT (n = 41), IGR (n = 41) and T2DM (n = 91). Blood pressure (BP), platelet count (PLT), mean platelet volume (MPV) and such fasting serum lipids as triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein (LDL-C), fast plasma glucose (FPG) and serum uric acid (UA) were determined. HbA1c and ankle/brachial index (ABI) were also measured.(1) The MPV level was highest in the T2DM group (12.3 ± 1.5) fl. And it was significantly higher in the IGR group than in the NGT group (9.7 ± 0.9 vs 8.0 ± 0.9) fl (P < 0.01). It was significantly higher in diabetics with HbA1c ≥ 7% (13.2 ± 1.9) fl than in patients those with HbA1c 7% (11.8 ± 1.7) fl (P < 0.01) (2) Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that age, serum creatinine, LDL-C and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) were important influencing factors of MPV (adjusted R(2) = 0.891)The MPV level in T2DM is significantly higher than that in NGT and IGR subjects. FPG, LDL-C, age and serum creatinine are important contributors to MPV. And MPV is an important risk factor of PAD.
