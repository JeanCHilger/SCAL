Long-term results after repair of tetralogy of Fallot. One hundred sixty-six patients with tetralogy of Fallot including 15 pulmonary atresia repaired since 1971 were analyzed with respect to their physical activities, school or social life, hemodynamics, ECG, reoperation and late mortality. Follow-up period ranged from 1 to 19 years with an average of 9.1. There were 9 late deaths including 4 sudden deaths. Actuarial survival rates at 5 and 13 years were 96.4% and 90.5%, respectively. Eighty-five patients (72.0%) of 118 replied were in NYHA functional class I, 31 (26.3%) in class II and 2 (1.7%) in class III. Thirteen patients (7.8%) demonstrated right ventricular/left ventricular systolic pressure ratio over 0.80 because of inadequate relief of the pulmonary stenosis or obstruction, hypoplasia of the pulmonary artery or external conduit stenosis. Although the left ventricular ejection fraction was maintained at the normal range (0.65 +/- 0.09), that of the right ventricle was below the normal level (0.52 +/- 0.09). Two patients developed complete heart block postoperatively and underwent pacemaker implantations. Complete right bundle branch block was observed in 85 patients including 6 with left axis deviation. Most of the patients after correction of tetralogy of Fallot are in satisfactory conditions. However, some patients have limitations in school or social life because of residual lesions or postoperative complications. It is important to consider the proper operative procedures to avoid these problems.
