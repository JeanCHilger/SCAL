The diagnosis of renal artery stenosis by the data from ultrasonic study methods. The purpose of the present investigation was to elaborate diagnostic criteria for stenosing of renal arteries according to ultrasonic dopplerography. The investigation included 35 patients suffering from vasorenal hypertension with stenoses of the renal arteries documented by angiography and 63 patients with stage II essential hypertension, who made up the control group. Ultrasonic scanning of the kidneys and dopplerography of the renal arteries were performed with the use of the Acuson-128 ultrasonic system fitted out with a sector transducer operating at a frequency of 3.5 MHz. The authors have devised a method of an ultrasonic study of the renal arteries by means of the posterolateral access. Established criteria for diagnosing stenosis of the renal artery. Among these are a decline of the pulsation index, the resistive index, and the systolic-diastolic velocity ratio as compared to the contralateral artery and nonstenosed renal arteries in the control group patients.
