Increased popliteal circumferential wall tension induced by orthostatic body posture is associated with local atherosclerotic plaques. Lower limb arteries are exposed to higher hemodynamic burden in erectile posture. This study evaluated the effects of body posture on popliteal, carotid and brachial circumferential wall tension (CWT) and investigated the relationship between local CWT and atherosclerotic plaques in subjects with cardiovascular risk factors.Two hundred and three subjects (118 women and 85 men) with cardiovascular risk factors (smoking, hypertension or diabetes mellitus) underwent clinical and laboratory analysis and had their blood pressure measured in the arm and calf in supine and orthostatic positions. Arteries were evaluated by ultrasound analysis, while CWT was calculated according to Laplace's law.Among the enrolled participants, 47%, 29% and none presented popliteal, carotid and brachial plaques, respectively. Carotid CWT measurements were not associated with local plaques after adjustment for potential confounders. Conversely, general linear model and logistic regression analyses adjusted for potential confounders demonstrated that peak orthostatic CWT was the only local hemodynamic parameter showing significant relationship with popliteal plaques in the whole sample. In gender-specific analyses, although positively correlated with popliteal plaques in both genders, local peak orthostatic CWT exhibited an independent association with popliteal plaques after adjustment for potential confounders only in women.Popliteal CWT measured in orthostatic posture, rather than in supine position, is associated with popliteal atherosclerotic plaques, particularly in women. These findings suggest that erectile posture might play a role in the atherogenesis of leg arteries by modifying local hemodynamic forces and that there may be gender differences in this regard.
