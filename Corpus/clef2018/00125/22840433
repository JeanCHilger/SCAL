Determination of ankle-brachial index using a portable doppler and a blood pressure measuring device in diabetic patients. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is one of the systemic manifestations of atherothrombosis. The subjects with atherosclerosis in a particular vascular bed are at increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications. The diagnostic methods currently available in Primary Care (PC) for the diagnosis of PAD are pedal pulse palpation, oscillometry and Doppler. We designed a descriptive study to determine the prevalence of PAD in diabetic patients by calculating their ankle-brachial index (ABI) using portable Doppler HADECO SMARTDOP 30EX and OMRON automatic blood pressure by two previously trained investigators-examiners, a doctor and a nurse. It was also intended to compare the results obtained with both diagnostic methods and learn the predictive value of a vascular event with an abnormal ABI. The prevalences of PAD measured with portable Doppler and automatic sphygmomanometer were 29.3 (95% CI 23.3 to 35.8) and 15.3 (95% CI
