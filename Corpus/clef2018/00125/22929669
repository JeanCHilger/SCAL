Microcirculation blood flow of the upper extremities in patients with coronary artery disease combined with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. The work was aimed at assessing the possibilities of the microcirculatory blood flow (MBF) of the upper extremities in patients suffering from coronary artery disease (CAD), as well as in patients with CAD accompanied by type 2 diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) by means of laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) using functional tests. The obtained findings of the study demonstrated that that the lowest reserve capabilities of the MBF were observed in the group of patients with CAD and NIDDM, and this group considerably more often versus patients with CAD without NIDDM showed decreased collateral reserve and low compensatory capabilities of the microcirculatory bed of the upper limbs.
