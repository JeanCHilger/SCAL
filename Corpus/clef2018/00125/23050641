Transcranial Doppler ultrasound in neurovascular diseases: diagnostic and therapeutic aspects. Albeit no direct anatomical information can be obtained, neurosonological methods provide real-time determination of velocity, and spectral waveform of blood flow in basal intracranial arteries adds significant benefit to the care of the patients with neurovascular diseases. Several features, such as relative simplicity in terms of interpretation and performance, significantly low cost, totally non-invasiveness, portability, and excellent temporal resolution, make neurosonology increasingly popular tool for evaluation, planning, and monitoring of treatment, and for determining prognosis in various neurovascular diseases. Usefulness of transcranial Doppler in diagnosing/monitoring subarachnoid hemorrhage related vasospasm and sickle cell vasculopathy is already well known. Utility in diagnosis of intracranial arterial stenosis, acute occlusion and recanalization, intracranial hemodynamic effect of the cervical arterial pathologies, intracranial pressure increase, and cerebral circulatory arrest are also well established. Neurosonological determination of vasomotor reactivity, cerebral autoregulation, neurovascular coupling, and micro-embolic signals detection are useful in the assessment of stroke risk, diagnosis of right-to-left shunting, and monitoring during surgery and interventional procedures. Transcranial Doppler is also an evolving ultrasound method with a therapeutic potential such as augmentation of clot lysis and cerebral delivery of thrombolytic or neuroprotective agent loaded nanobubbles in neurovascular diseases. The aim of this study is to give an overview of current usage of the different ultrasound modalities in different neurovascular diseases.
