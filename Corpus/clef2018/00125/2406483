Hemodynamic changes with arterial stenosis experimentally created using the sliding calipers method. The relationship of blood pressure, blood flow and Doppler waveform to arterial stenosis was investigated in a canine model. The method of making a stenosis involved using slide calipers and the critical stenosis of the femoral artery was 75 per cent. Among the parameters from Doppler waveform peak forward velocity, pulsatility index, acceleration and deceleration correlated well with arterial stenosis, having correlation coefficients of -0.729, -0.856, -0.824 and -0.739, respectively. The results of this method conform closely to clinical conditions with regard to progress of the occlusive process.
