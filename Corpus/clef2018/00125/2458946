VIP modulates substance P-induced plasma extravasation in vivo. Substance P (SP), a putative mediator of neurogenic inflammation, has previously been shown to induce plasma extravasation when exogenously perfused over a blister base induced on the rat hind foot pad. Using the same animal model, we have studied the role of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), one of the neuromodulators in primary afferent neurons, on SP-induced plasma extravasation. At all concentrations tested (2.5, 5 and 10 microM), VIP did not cause plasma extravasation by itself, however, it increased that due to 1 microM SP, in a dose-related manner. We have also studied the effect of VIP on the local blood flow in the blister base using a laser doppler-flowmeter. VIP was also found to increase the local blood flow in a dose-dependent manner. The present results provide evidence for the first time in vivo of a role for VIP in modulating a neurogenic inflammatory response induced by SP. The mechanism underlying this action is probably related to the vasodilator activity of VIP.
