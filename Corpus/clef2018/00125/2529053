Influence of inflation pressure and balloon size on the development of intimal hyperplasia after balloon angioplasty. A study in the atherosclerotic rabbit. To evaluate the effect of balloon size and inflation pressure on acute and subsequent outcome following balloon angioplasty (BA), 70 New Zealand White rabbits with bilateral femoral atherosclerosis were assigned to four groups: group 1, oversized balloon, low inflation pressure (n = 35 vessels balloon size, 3.0 mm/inflation pressure, 5 atm)
