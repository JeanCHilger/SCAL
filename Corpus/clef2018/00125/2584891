Arterial pathology of the limbs. Tests for hyperemia. We consider the walk test on the treadmill (ET), and the postocclusive reactive hyperemia (HR). The determinations are limited to the peripheral pressures measured by the sphygmomanometric-Doppler technique. It is the method of choice for diagnostic purposes, but is necessary only for selected cases. For epidemiology, HR is interesting because it is simple to apply and the sensitivity and specificity to recognise moderate obstructions is good. The determination of the ankle pressure at rest is generally enough in the routine practice. It is reproducible and safe. ET may be applied in certain conditions taking into account some problems of interpretation due the complexity of the phenomenon.
