Therapeutic efficacy of intravenously applied prostaglandin E1. The pharmacological effects of intravenous PGE1 on the macro- and microcirculation were investigated in two independent studies. In the first study 10 healthy subjects were given one i.v. infusion of 2 and 3 ampoules of Prostavasin (40/60 mcg PGE1) respectively, each over 1 hour with at least 1 day wash-out phase. Before as well as 20', 30', 40', 60' and 90 min after the infusion had started measurements of the blood flow in the A. femoralis communis were performed by the means of a Doppler ultrasound technique combined with a computer program (Mavis). Furthermore, tcPO2, heart rate and blood pressure as well as possible adverse reactions were registered. In the second study 10 patients with PAOD stage IIb (mean age: 49.5 years) received one i.v. infusion of 1, 2 and 3 ampoules of Prostavasin (20, 40, 60 mcg PGE1) respectively, in 250 ml saline over 1 hour with at least 1 day wash-out phase. Before as well as 20', 40', 60', 120' and 180 min after the infusion had started, the arterial blood flow was recorded with the method described above. TcPO2, plasma viscosity, erythrocyte aggregation, blood pressures and heart rate just as possible side effects were also registered. All PGE1 regimens induced a significant dose-dependent increase in the femoral blood flow with a maximum of 68% after 40 mcg of PGE1 and 79% after 60 mcg of PGE1 in healthy subjects and a maximum of 60% after 20 mcg of PGE1, 128% after 40 mcg of PGE1 and 161% after 60 mcg of PGE1 in the patients with pAOD (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
