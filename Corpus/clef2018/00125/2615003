A noninvasive study on characteristics of the left ventricular function in elderly hypertensive patients. To characterize the left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function in elderly hypertensives, mechano-and echocardiography was performed in 27 elderly patients more than 65 years of age (20 hypertensives and 7 normotensives) and 46 middle-aged patients (34 hypertensives and 12 normotensives). In normotensives, a positive correlation was found to exist between age and blood pressure, LV wall thickness, II-RF interval and the A/E ratio, whereas the correlation of age to systolic parameters such as ET/PEP and EF was absent. This suggests that the LV diastolic function was impaired progressively by aging with preservation of the LV systolic function. In elderly hypertensives, LV systolic function was deteriorated and the A/E ratio increased as diastolic blood pressure became elevated. The A/E ratio also increased in this group as compared with that in middle-aged hypertensives, although the differences was not statistically significant. Unlike those in middle-aged hypertensives, the indices of LV function except the elevated blood pressure and the increased cardio-thoracic ratio were not significantly different between hypertensive and normotensive elderly patients. This might be because of the wide range of normal values in elderly persons due to the various degrees of atherosclerotic changes and other pathophysiologic factors, which might have masked obvious characteristics of hypertension in elderly hypertensives.
