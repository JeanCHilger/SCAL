LaPlace transform analysis of femoral artery Doppler signals: the state of the art. A followup study was conducted to validate our previous experience with the LaPlace Transform Analysis (LTA) method for processing Doppler ultrasound signals from the common femoral artery to detect significant stenosis of the aorto-iliac segment. The first phase used the same instantaneous mean velocity signal processor as used in the prior study. A comparison of the Doppler examinations with angiograms in 98 legs yielded a sensitivity = 92% and sensitivity = 94% in the identification of 50% or greater stenosis of the aorta-iliac segment, results almost identical to the last study. Because of theoretical disadvantages of using the instantaneous mean velocity signal we carried out a second phase using a peak velocity detector. In 148 limbs sensitivity = 87% and specificity = 98%. The presence or absence of superficial femoral artery occlusion did not affect the accuracy of the waveform analysis in the detection of proximal disease. The LTA parameter related to distal resistance, G, was not found to have clinical value in the assessment of the femoral-popliteal segment.
