Combined non-invasive diagnostics of deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremities. Application of a combined non-invasive diagnostic approach to screening examination of a high-risk group of patients made it possible to detect phlebothrombosis on 34 lower extremities in 31 patients with absent clinical manifestations of the disease. Combined use of Doppler ultrasound flowmetry and occlusive venous plethysmography increases the accuracy of the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremities up to 96%.
