Diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis with an ultrasonic Doppler technique: a study of 64 cases. Doppler ultrasound examination and radionuclide venography were performed on 82 limbs of 64 patients with a clinical diagnosis of femoral and/or popliteal vein thrombosis. Doppler ultrasound diagnosis gave positive results in 19 of 21 limbs with femoral and/or popliteal vein thrombosis. In 61 limbs without femoral or popliteal thrombosis, the diagnosis was excluded by Doppler ultrasound in 80 per cent of cases. In both groups, Doppler ultrasound was superior to physical signs in making the correct diagnosis.
