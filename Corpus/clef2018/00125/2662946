Reproducibility of non-invasive vascular diagnosis in patients with diabetes mellitus. Reproducibility of noninvasive ultrasound methods for vascular diagnosis was studied in 36 patients with Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus. The vascular examination included a) the measurement of ankle systolic arterial pressure and ankle/arm pressure index (c.w. Doppler), b) Echo-Doppler examination of iliac arteries with measurement of maximum systolic frequency, systolic spectrum width and diastolic reverse flow component. A grading of iliac artery stenosis was also performed. The examination was repeated after one month according to a blind protocol. The coefficients of variation were as follows: 8% for ankle pressure 8% for ankle/arm pressure index
