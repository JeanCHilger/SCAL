Vascular complications of the patient undergoing intra-aortic balloon pumping. Despite advances in intra-aortic balloon catheters and consoles, the vascular complication rate of IABP has not decreased. Predisposing complication factors identified through research include gender, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, catheter size, prolonged pumping, ankle-arm index less than 1.0, and insertion method. Signs and symptoms of leg ischemia due to thromboembolus or compartment syndrome may occur in as high as 40 per cent of patients. Assessment, documentation, and teaching remain important aspects of the nurse's role in the prevention and detection of vascular complications.
