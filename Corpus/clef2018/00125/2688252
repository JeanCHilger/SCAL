Duplex Doppler ultrasound in determination of renal artery stenosis. Twenty-six cases of renal artery stenosis were evaluated with Doppler ultrasound using the pulsatile flow index (PFI). To establish normal values, the PFI in 60 renal arteries in 30 healthy volunteers was obtained. Normal values by PFI ranged between 0.48 and 0.71 (mean +/- SD: 0.6 +/- 0.06). In renal artery stenosis the PFI range was 0.72-0.79. The normal upper limit was 0.71. The PFI failed in three patients however, an ultrasound examination showed secondary renal disease (two patients with stenosis on both sides with a shrunken kidney on one side, and one patient with hypernephroma on the opposite side). The PFI was normal (14 of 14 patients) in patients without angiographic evidence of stenosis or after successful dilatation.
