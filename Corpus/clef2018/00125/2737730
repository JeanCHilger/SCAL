Central vasopressin raises arterial pressure by sympathetic activation and vasopressin release. Although central administration of arginine vasopressin (AVP) has been reported to increase arterial pressure mediated by activation of the sympathetic system, we found that peripheral blockade of sympathetic transmission did not attenuate this pressor response. To elucidate the mechanism, rats were pretreated with either phentolamine (3 mg/kg), chlorisondamine (2.5 mg/kg), a vasopressin V1 receptor antagonist d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP (AVP-X) (10 micrograms/kg), or the combinations of phentolamine and AVP-X or chlorisondamine and AVP-X. The pressor response to intracerebroventricular injection of AVP in unrestrained conscious rats was reduced but not significantly altered by intravenous injection of phentolamine or AVP-X however, combined treatment with these agents abolished the response. To determine that the amount of central AVP leaked to the periphery did not contribute to the pressor effect, tritiated AVP and AVP (100 ng total) were injected intracerebroventricularly. Blood samples collected at 0, 3, and 30 minutes after injection showed that radioactivity in plasma was primarily metabolites and that the amount of intact AVP estimated to leak from the brain was too low to produce a pressor effect. Comparative regional hemodynamic studies between intracerebroventricular and intravenous injection of AVP performed in conscious rats instrumented with Doppler flow probes demonstrated a qualitatively similar pattern of increased resistance in the renal, mesenteric, and hindquarters beds. These data suggest that central pressor action of AVP is mediated by both activation of the sympathetic system and release of AVP.
