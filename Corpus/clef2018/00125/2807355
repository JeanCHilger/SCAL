Experimental evaluation of a new transducer tipped catheter. The accuracy and fidelity of a new transducer-tipped catheter (Camino Laboratories) was compared in 10 closed chest anesthetized dogs with standard Millar catheters. Simultaneous Camino and Millar measurements of left ventricular pressures and its first derivative (dp/dt) were recorded in control, after Isoprenaline infusion and during left anterior descending coronary artery balloon occlusion, to vary the pressures for comparison. Linear regression analysis comparing the Camino and Millar systems yielded a good correlation, and one way analysis of variance showed no difference between the two catheter readings, thus revealing that the recently developed Camino disposable transducer-tipped catheter provides accurate measurements of left ventricular pressure and its first derivative.
