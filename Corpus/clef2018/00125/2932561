Long-term hemodynamic evaluation of lower extremity percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) has provided an alternative method of treatment for occlusive disease of the lower extremities. However, the long-term durability of PTA compared with that of surgical reconstruction has not been adequately evaluated. This study was undertaken to assess the long-term hemodynamic results of PTA. Thirty-four dilatations performed on 28 patients over a 30-month period and followed for 1 to 53 months were reviewed. Twenty-two dilatations were done in the iliac arteries, seven in the superficial femoral, three in the popliteal, one in the peroneal artery, and one at a bypass graft anastomosis. All patients underwent noninvasive measurements of lower extremity segmental pressure prior to dilatation and at scheduled follow-up intervals. Success was defined as an increase in the Doppler-derived segmental lower extremity/brachial index of greater than or equal to 0.15 or normalization of the index (greater than or equal to 0.90), measured at the closest level distal to the site of dilatation. Sixteen of 22 iliac dilatations (72.7%) were initially successful. However, long-term success was maintained in only six (27.6%). Cumulative hemodynamic success for the initially successful iliac dilatations was 28% at 3 years. Seven of 11 (63.6%) dilatations performed on infrainguinal arteries were initially successful however, only two (18.2%) experienced continued success. Cumulative hemodynamic success for the initially successful infrainguinal dilatations in this group was 35% at 3 years. Although immediate patency and improvement in hemodynamic parameters are similar to comparable surgical procedures, these results demonstrate that PTA is not as durable as conventional surgical procedures.
