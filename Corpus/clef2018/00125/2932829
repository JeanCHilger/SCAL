Doppler ultrasonic investigation of Raynaud's phenomenon: effect of temperature on blood velocity. We have used spectral analysis of signals from a pulsed, range-gated Doppler ultrasonic instrument to make quantitative measurements of arterial blood flow velocity in the hands of normal subjects and persons with Raynaud's phenomenon. We measured the peak velocity during the cardiac cycle and the time integral of the velocity signal over the cardiac cycle. This latter parameter gives a sensitive indication of the degree of vasoconstriction in response to cold. Our preliminary results, based on findings in 13 subjects, suggest that Doppler ultrasound can differentiate persons with Raynaud's phenomenon from normal subjects.
