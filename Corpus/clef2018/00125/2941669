Waveform analysis applied to laser Doppler flowmetry. Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) has been found useful in monitoring free flaps. In the present study, waveform analysis has been applied to the LDF waveform. Waveform changes were investigated in the microcirculation during varying degrees of arterial or venous occlusion in the saphenous island and flap of the dog and the human digit. The quantitative analysis of laser Doppler flowmetry waveform allows for the diagnosis of arterial occlusion or venous occlusion and their differentiation.
