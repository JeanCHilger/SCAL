Assessment of blood flow in the small intestine with laser Doppler flowmetry. Blood flow in the small intestine was assessed in 48 patients by laser Doppler flowmetry. Mucosal and serosal flowmeter signals were compared during 'resting' conditions, vascular occlusion, and reactive hyperemia. Serosal flowmeter recordings were compared with the total blood flow of a bowel segment as measured by venous collection. The magnitudes of the mucosal (n = 49) and serosal (n = 49) flowmeter signals were comparable throughout the whole range of flowmeter signals (r = 0.97 p less than 0.001). A correlation coefficient of 0.95 (n = 51
