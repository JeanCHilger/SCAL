Measurement of colonic blood flow with laser Doppler flowmetry. Colonic blood flow was measured with laser Doppler flowmetry during operation in 62 patients and during coloscopy in 15 patients. In 18 subjects mucosal and serosal laser Doppler signals were compared during 'resting' conditions, vascular occlusion, and reactive hyperemia. The mucosal (n = 36) and serosal (n = 36) flowmeter signals were of the same order of magnitude throughout the whole range of flowmeter signals (r = 0.96 p less than 0.001). In eight subjects total venous outflow from a colonic segment was measured simultaneously with flowmeter recordings from the serosal side. A correlation coefficient of 0.95 (n = 46
