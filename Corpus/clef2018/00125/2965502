Determinants and protective potential of coronary arterial collaterals as assessed by an angioplasty model. Two indexes of collateral blood flow, the ratio of distal coronary occlusion pressure/aortic pressure (DCOP/Pao) and angiographic collateral class were determined during elective angioplasty in 36 patients with normal left ventricular function. The association between collateral indexes and 8 anatomic and clinical variables was assessed. A reduction in luminal diameter by greater than or equal to 70% predicted angiographically demonstrable collaterals with 100% specificity and 85% sensitivity. Lesion severity (stenosis) correlated with both collateral class and DCOP/Pao: DCOP/Pao = 2.8809 - 0.0729 X stenosis + 0.00049 X stenosis. The data suggest a quantitative relation between lesion severity and collateral development beyond a threshold value of 70% stenosis. Left ventricular ejection fraction during ischemia caused by balloon occlusion (EFo) was found to be primarily determined by lesion location however, collateral flow modified EFo significantly. For mid-left anterior descending and right coronary artery: EFo = 59 + 26 X (DCOP/Pao)
