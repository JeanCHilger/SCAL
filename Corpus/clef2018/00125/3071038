Doppler ultrasound procedures in the diagnosis of occlusive processes of the supra-aortic arteries. Reported in this paper is experience obtained from application of Doppler sonography to more than 2,000 examinations of patients with suspicion of cerebrovascular insufficiency. Indications for Doppler-type investigation are described together with criteria of Doppler sonography for positive detection of occlusive processes in greater brain-feeding arteries and for adequate assessment of results obtained from vascular surgery. The sensitivity of Doppler sonography amounted to 88.8 per cent and its specificity to 92.9 per cent, as recorded from 117 patients who had been angiographically followed up. Doppler ultrasonography for its high productivity in terms of wide-ranging diagnostic information was found to be the optional method for non-invasive diagnosis of occlusion in supra-aortic arteries, provided absence of contraindications.
