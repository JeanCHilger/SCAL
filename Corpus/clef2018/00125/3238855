Value of segmental systolic pressure determination in the diagnosis and selection of reconstructive operations of the aorto-ileo-femoral segments. The segmentary systolic pressure along the lower extremities was studied by means of ultrasonic dopplerosphygmomanometry in patients with isolated and associated lesions of the aorto-ileo-femoral segment. The possibility to investigate the hemodynamic significance of stenotic lesions of the arteries is shown which is of value for choice of the method of reconstructive operations in associated lesions of the aorto-ileo-femoral segment.
