Epidural spinal cord electrical stimulation improves microvascular blood flow in severe limb ischemia. Epidural spinal cord electrical stimulation (ESES) was performed on 10 patients with severe limb ischemia due to atherosclerotic disease. Microcirculatory parameters were assessed before and after ESES. Bright field microscopy was used to assess capillary diameters and red blood cell (RBC) velocity in the dorsum of the foot. Fluorescein microscopy was used with intravenously injected sodium fluorescein to study capillary density and sodium fluorescein appearance time in the dorsum of the toe. The systolic ankle/arm pressure ratio and toe pressure measurements were used as macrocirculatory parameters. After ESES, clinical improvement was confirmed by intravital microscopy. Capillary density increased (p less than 0.001), RBC velocity in capillaries already perfused before ESES increased from 0.054 mm/sec to 0.762 mm/sec (p less than 0.001), and sodium fluorescein appearance time decreased from 72 to 45 seconds (p less than 0.001). Capillary diameter did not change significantly so that the increase in RBC velocity may be interpreted as enhanced volume flow. Systolic ankle/arm pressure ratios and digital arterial pressure did not change significantly. The current results show that in patients with severe occlusive arterial disease of the lower limbs, ESES recruits capillaries not perfused in the control situation and enhances skin blood flow, improvements that may explain the beneficial clinical effects of ESES.
