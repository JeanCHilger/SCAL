Intraoperative color-flow Doppler imaging of AVM's and aneurysms. The use of intraoperative color-flow Doppler sonography to image cerebral and spinal arteriovenous malformations (AVM's) and a giant aneurysm is reported in 10 patients. The technique is a useful adjunct in localizing vascular lesions, identifying feeding or draining vessels, and confirming intraoperative surgical excision of AVM's or ligation of giant aneurysms. Imaging of lesions deeper than 4 to 5 cm is, however, limited with the equipment design now commercially available.
