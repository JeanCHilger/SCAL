Decreased venous outflow without venous obstruction--an analysis of three cases. Three patients without prior thrombosis or varicosities presented with decreased venous outflow. They suffered from venous complaints, such as oedema and pain in the leg after prolonged standing. Phlebograms showed no obstruction or hypoplasia. Normal function of calf muscle pump and valves was present at venous pressure determination. The theoretical basis of venous emptying is discussed and a hypothesis is postulated that decreased emptying is due to a change in elastic properties of the venous vessel wall.
