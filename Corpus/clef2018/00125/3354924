Age- and sex-related changes in the ratio between ankle and brachial systolic pressure in normal subjects. The ratio between ankle (ASP) and brachial (BSP) systolic pressure was studied by using Doppler ultrasound in 198 normal subjects aged between twenty and ninety years: 97 males and 101 females. The ASP/BSP ratio decreased significantly with age both in males (r = -0.64 p less than 0.001) and in females (r = -0.72
