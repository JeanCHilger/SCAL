Complications during and following radial artery cannulation: a prospective study. One hundred and eighteen 20-g radial artery catheters were prospectively evaluated in 109 cardiovascular surgical patients. 0.024% papaverine in saline was used as a continuous flushing solution. Using the Doppler method, obstruction of the radial artery with the catheter in situ was found in 11 (9.8%) patients. Decannulation was performed at the end of the monitoring in 93 (78.9%) cases while 25 (21.1%) catheters had to be removed earlier. According to Allen's radial flush and Doppler evaluation after decannulation, three (2.5%) radial artery occlusions and one stenosis persisted. However, no vascular insufficiency occurred during the study period. Female patients developed more complications with the catheter in situ but not after catheter removal. Wrist size did not predict the complications. Age, concomitant diseases, traumatic cannulation, type of the surgery, longer cannulation time and perioperative complications did not influence the incidence of abnormal radial blood flow after decannulation. Our results confirm the low incidence of significant complications following radial artery cannulation.
