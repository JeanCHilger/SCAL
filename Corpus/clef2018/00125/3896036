Clinical-instrumental relationships in post-phlebitic syndrome. 981 lower limbs belonging to 829 subjects, 67.6% of which were females, have been examined. The average venous pressure at the tibial posterior vein was 101 +/- 12 mmHg and 102 +/- 13 mmHg on the internal saphenous vein. In 311 lower limbs with femoro-iliac thrombosis, venous pressures are slightly higher than in 670 lower limbs with calf veins occlusion. In the 44.4% of cases the phlebothrombosis was clearly dependent on traumas, deliveries, surgical operations or other conditions. The relationships between the supposed aetiopathogenesis of the affection and the pressure values have been examined. The 6.7% refers to phlebitis, which caused pulmonary embolism during their acute phase. The different objective and subjective symptoms have, furthermore, been taken into consideration. It has been noticed by the analysis of the diagrams of the pressure values in the time that the same values which are considerably high at the initial phase of the iliac postphlebitic syndrome, are always high in the following years. On the other hand, in postphlebitic syndrome of the leg those pressures whose value are not remarkably high in the initial phase, increase from the second to the fourth year after the arising of phlebitis and, finally become stable at fairly high values, but still lower than those of iliac syndrome. The venous orthostatic pressure of internal saphenous vein in the iliac postphlebitic syndrome was also found to exceed the deep pressures, likely because of the altered saphenous discharge at the cross level.
