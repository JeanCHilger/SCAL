Role of sonography. What more does it contribute than the Doppler test in the search for supra-aortic trunk lesions in the assessment of a patient presenting with a lower-limb arteriopathy?. Supra-aortic trunk lesions were present in 40% of patients with constricted stage II, and stages III and IV of lower limb arteriopathy, while 17.5% presented hemodynamically significant stenotic lesions. It appears essential, therefore, to perform Doppler tests during routine investigations, particularly since most of these patients will improve after surgery. The Doppler ultrasound and echotomographic examinations are complementary and indissociable. The former studies hemodynamics and the latter the arterial condition of the tissue and its pathologic variations (regular hyperechogenic plaque, intraluminal irregular, only slightly echogenic plaque, aneurysm). The Doppler ultrasound test is an important and sufficient investigation, particularly for hemodynamic lesions: thrombosis, prethrombotic states and stenosis greater than 70%, whereas the ultrasonographic examination is confirmatory in non-hemodynamically significant cases. Combining these two exploratory procedures can optimize management, indications for arteriography and the choice of therapy in these patients with multiple arterial lesions.
