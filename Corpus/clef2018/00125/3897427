Combined study of carotid bifurcations using intravenous computed angiography and Doppler ultrasound in lower-limb arteritis. Carotid artery bifurcations were studied in 18 patients with arteritis, by Doppler ultrasound imaging and intravenous computed angiography. Both techniques are reliable examinations for detection of stenosed carotid artery lesions. Combining the two is increasingly used as a reliable means of exploration of stenosis of the carotid artery bifurcations. They therefore reduce the need for the more invasive conventional arteriography.
