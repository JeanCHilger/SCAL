Peripheral vascular disease: flow studies and clinical results after isovolemic hemodilution--case reports. The authors, after a brief introduction concerning hemorheology pathophysiology, report the results of a study on 18 patients suffering from vascular disease at the second, third and fourth stage (Fontaine) who underwent isovolemic hemodilution therapy. The Travis Winsor index (evaluated by Doppler ultrasound) and the perfusion volume (evaluated by impedance rheography) were both significantly increased after treatment. In some patients such increase were also associated with a reduction of subjective symptoms.
