Diagnosis of incompetent communicating veins in contrast medium-sensitive patients. A new functional method of phlebotonometry was used by the authors in 36 contrast--sensitive patient with postthrombophlebitic syndrome and varicosis for the purpose of diagnosing incompetent calf communicants. The determination of venous pressure in the superficial veins in these patients should be carried out between tourniquets three times at rest and against the backgrounds of the Valdman's test with the patient in a horizontal position by means of Valdman apparatus with elongated capillary tubes.
