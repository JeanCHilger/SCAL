Resting blood pressure index in arterial occlusive disease of the lower limbs. The resting blood pressure index of the ankle by the Doppler Ultrasound technique was correlated to the clinical picture and angiographic appearances in 152 legs. A very good correlation existed between the clinical picture and resting pressure index. The latter followed the angiographic status expressed by a score. We could not show any differences between the gropus pains at rest, gangrene or ulceration, either by resting pressure index or by angiographic score. Statistically highly significant differences were found between the resting pressure index and the groups asymptomatic legs, to the intermittent claudication and claudication to pains at rest or gangrene. Irrespective of where the stenosis is localized, the resting blood pressure index of the ankle is the same when the functional status of the patient is the same. This method cannot define the anatomical distribution of occlusive disease therefore it cannot replace the angiographic examination when there is an indication for reconstructive arterial surgery. However, in the routine assessment, it offers an objective, reproducible and simple method for evaluating the functional effect of occlusive arterial disease in the lower limbs.
