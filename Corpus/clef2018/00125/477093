The mechanisms of severe arterial injury in surgery of the hip joint. Vascular accidents occurring in the course of hip surgery may reach potentially catastrophic dimensions by posing an immediate and sudden threat to life and limb. This is a report of 15 cases with severe arterial injury representing 0.2--0.3% of all reconstructive hip operations performed during an 8 year period. In 6 cases perforation of either the external iliac artery, the common femoral artery of main branches of the lateral and medial circumflex femoral artery were caused by the tip of a narrow-pointed Hohmann retractor used to expose the hip joint. Other mechanisms were: intimal tear with appositional thrombosis, probably caused by mechanical strain imposed on atherosclerotic arteries, giving rise to complete limb ischemia (2 cases) the dangers associated with the entry of bone cement through a defective acetabulum into the pelvis causing thrombotic occlusion due to polymerization heat (one case) or intimate adhesion of artificial bone to the external iliac artery subsequently being ripped open during replacement of the cup (one case)
