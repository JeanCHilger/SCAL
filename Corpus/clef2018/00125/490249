Noninvasive diagnosis of neonatal asphyxia and intraventricular hemorrhage by Doppler ultrasound. The cerebrovascular hemodynamic alterations in asphyxia and intracerebral-intraventricular hemorrhage were determined by monitoring the pulsatile flow changes in the anterior cerebral arteries using Doppler ultrasound. The pulsatility index measurements, which were calculated from the recorded changes in Doppler frequency shifts, were obtained in four groups of newborn infants with the following diagnoses: Group I--normal term (n=21) Group II--asphyxia (n=12)
