An automatic, multi-function pressure cuff control unit. A fully automatic blood pressure cuff control system is described. The system is designed for use in the assessment of peripheral vascular disease and helps reduce the amount of operator attention required to carry out such measurements properly. It also provides repeatable control of specific functions, thereby eliminating a potential source of variability. The system incorporates a pneumatic control system, an integrated silicon pressure transducer, and a digital readout. The design, modes of operation, safety features, and use of the system are described.
