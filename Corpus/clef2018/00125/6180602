Diagnostic value of fibrinopeptide A and beta-thromboglobulin in acute deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The purpose of this study was to assess the predictive values of the assays of fibrinopeptide A (FPA), beta-thromboglobulin (BTG) and their combination in patients suspected of having acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). In 80 controls the mean (+/- SD) plasma concentrations of FPA and BTG were 0.72 +/- 0.47 and 28.2 +/- 10.1 ng/ml, respectively. In 26 patients in whom DVT was confirmed by phlebography and Doppler ultrasound, clearly raised mean FPA (5.62 ng/ml) and BTG (70.6 ng/ml) concentrations were measured compared to those in 13 patients in whom this disorder was excluded (1.00 and 33.6 ng/ml, respectively). Also in 25 patients, in whom PE was established by perfusion lung scanning, clearly increased mean FPA (6.28 ng/ml) and BTG (82.4 ng/ml) concentrations were measured compared to those in 12 patients without this disease (1.03 and 32.5 ng/ml, respectively). Raised FPA and BTG concentrations were also found in 20 patients with inflammatory disorders and in 10 with various types of malignancy. The mean FPA and BTG concentrations did not differ between patients with renal failure or diabetes mellitus and patients without these diseases. From the predictive values of these assays and their combination it can be concluded that raised FPA and BTG concentrations are not specific for thrombosis. However, when normal FPA and BTG concentrations are present, acute DVT or PE can safely be excluded in symptomatic patients. In the group with confirmed DVT/PE, anticoagulant treatment (heparin and phenprocoumon) brought down the mean FPA concentration to levels within the normal range in less than 1 hour while the mean BTG concentration remained elevated throughout the 10-day study period.
