Therapeutic use of flunarizine in the treatment arteriopathies of the lower extremities. 94 patients with Stage II obliterating arteriopathy of the lower extremities, treated with Flunarizine (10-20 mg per diem), were checked every two months for a 6 month period. Of the 76 patients reaching the final check up, 58 had received no previous treatment and 18 had ischemias secondary to reconstructive vascular surgery. Clinical improvement in terms of increased independent mobility and improved Doppler flowmeter pressure readings were noted in both groups. In view of its beneficial effects on blood vessel function in other areas, Flunarizine is felt to be a valuable drug for the treatment of peripheral arteriopathies, both initially and in cases of ischaemia following vascular surgery.
