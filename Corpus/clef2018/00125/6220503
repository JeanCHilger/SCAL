Renal angioplasty: experiences with 94 patients. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) was performed on 94 patients with hypertension due to renovascular stenosis. In 76 cases PTA was successful. Even in the presence of severe arteriosclerosis the balloon catheter technique was successful and resulted in few complications. Recording intraluminal blood pressure is the best parameter to predict a successful outcome. Nuclear studies are helpful in the follow-up of patients. The principal aim of PTA is to lower the blood pressure and to salvage the diseased kidney.
