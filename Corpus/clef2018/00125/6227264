The correction of cerebrovascular insufficiency by transluminal dilatation: a preliminary report. Transluminal angioplasty is being extensively utilized to dilate arteriosclerotic lesions. However, this technique has not been widely used for the treatment of cerebrovascular insufficiency. This report describes the application of transluminal angioplasty to relieve cerebral ischemia secondary to extracranial arterial stenosis. A total of 10 patients presented with symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency. Bilateral upper extremity pressures were measured prior to the performance of arteriography on all patients. Significant stenoses were found in the subclavian artery (9) and in the innominate artery (1). Dilating catheters were passed retrograde through surgically exposed brachial and common carotid arteries. Transluminal angioplasty under fluoroscopic control was attempted. Anatomic correction of all lesions was achieved without hemorrhagic or embolic complications. The mean increase in brachial systolic pressure was 38.2 mm Hg postdilatation. Initial symptomatic relief was total in seven patients, partial in two, and absent in one. It is believed that associated small vessel brain stem disease accounted for the less than total relief of symptoms of these three patients. Average follow-up for all patients was 13 months with one recurrent subclavian artery stenosis occurring at three months postangioplasty. Preliminary results suggest that some patients with cerebral ischemia secondary to extracranial arterial stenosis can be treated safely by transluminal angioplasty.
