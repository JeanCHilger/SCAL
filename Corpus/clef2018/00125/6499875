Effect of therapy on 24-h subcutaneous blood flow in the leg in patients with severe ischemia. The effect of vascular surgical reconstruction or Buerger's exercises upon average subcutaneous blood flow for a 24-h period was studied in 14 patients with severe leg ischemia due to occlusive arterial disease. Blood flow was estimated proximally in the calf and in the foot by a 133Xe washout technique. Seven patients underwent vascular surgery. Postoperatively subcutaneous blood flow increased in the calf and the foot in all patients except one in whom a decrease in blood flow in the foot was seen. In this case a decrease in systolic blood pressure occurred following the operation. Buerger's exercises did not alter subcutaneous blood flow either in the calf or in the foot in the seven patients studied. Buerger's exercises seem to be of no value for these patients. The measurement of blood flow in subcutaneous tissue over a period of 24 h seems to be a useful test of the effect of different treatments.
