Clinical evaluation of a femoral compression method for ischemic legs by transcutaneous oxygen tension measurement. Transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPo2) of the lower extremities was investigated in 20 patients of peripheral arterial occlusive disease. TcPo2 was monitored from bilateral calf and dorsum of the foot. Femoral compression method meant that the tourniquet was set at femoral region and the tourniquet was inflated to a suprasystolic pressure for 4 minutes, after cuff was deflated, TcPo2 returned to the initial level. T(min) was the time it took until initial TcPo2 level. T1/2(min) was the time it took until 50 percent of the initial level. The following results were obtained. T1/2 showed significant relation to Ankle Pressure Index. T1/2 of dorsum of foot showed blood flow of distal side of calf region and T1/2 of calf showed blood flow of femoral region. T1/2 was significant difference between ASO and TAO, among different sites of peripheral vascular occlusion. T1/2 measurement was a much more useful indicator of limb flow after operation than TcPo2 measurement.
