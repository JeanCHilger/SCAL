Comparison between segmental and selective blood flow volume of the lower limbs: a plethysmographic and ultrasonic study of normal subjects at rest. In order to find the correlations existing between segmental and selective arterial blood flow volume, 20 healthy subjects have been submitted to calf venous occlusion plethysmography and Multichannel Digital Pulsed Doppler examination of the common femoral and popliteal arteries at rest. We found a linear correlation only between mean popliteal artery blood flow volume and plethysmographic calf blood flow volume (r = 0,41 p less than 0,01). We therefore suggest that venous occlusion plethysmography should not be used for the assessment of aorto-iliac and common femoral hemodynamics after direct arterial reconstructive surgery. Its use should be complementary to pulsed Doppler blood flow volume determination at the femoro-popliteal level, along with the usual pressure measurement.
