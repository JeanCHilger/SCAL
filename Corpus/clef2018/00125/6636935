Results of a computer-based analysis of peripheral pulse waves in arterial occlusive diseases of the lower extremity. A system of data acquisition and computer analysis for pulse wave measurements, realized by means of electronic oscillography (Boucke-Brecht system) or impedance rheography, is described. The system includes: 1. Computer-compatible data acquisition and registration 2. Conversion of data into digital form 3. Data processing and evaluation of parameters 4. Classification. Records are taken from equivalent points of left and right lower extremities. Computer analysis is performed off-line using a small computer (TPA-i). The computer program evaluates the following parameters: 1. Time intervals and amplitudes of pulse propagation time, inclinations, crest time, peak width, maximum and minimum of dicrotic wave 2. Areas between pulse curve and baseline 3. Extremes of 1st and 2nd derivates for the dynamic characterization of signal 4. Fourier coefficients All parameters are computed for 12 single pulse cycles and finally averaged, printed out, and stored in a data bank. The diagnostic significance of all these parameters was examined and evaluated for separation of normal and pathological curves. With linear discriminance analysis a correct classification of about 90% was obtained. Advantages of computer analysis are: 1. Time-consuming visual evaluation is avoided. 2. Accuracy and reliability of diagnosis are improved. 3. Additional parameters offer more diagnostic information. Further investigations are directed toward reducing the number of parameters and developing an efficient screening method for early diagnosis of peripheral arterial obstructions.
