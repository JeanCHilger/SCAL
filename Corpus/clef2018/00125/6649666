What does the Doppler ultrasonic technic accomplish in angiology?. Doppler ultrasound was the most important diagnostic improvement in angiology during the last twenty years. This technique has been used answering the following clinical questions: severity of peripheral vascular disease diagnostic of cerebro-vascular disease and diagnostic of deep vein thrombosis. Doppler ultrasound provides a clinical useful and objective evaluation of peripheral artery disease. MÃ¶nckeberg's sclerosis and leg oedema give false results only. The sensitivity of carotid Doppler investigations is over 90%. Deep vein thrombosis of the leg and pelvis can be diagnosed correctly in about 90% of cases. Ultrasonic methods are not only reliable but have also the advantages of being non-invasive, repeatable and inexpensive.
