Arterial pressure measurements correlated to symptoms and signs of peripheral arterial disease. The systolic pressure observed in 150 patients with peripheral arterial disease has been compared to their symptoms and signs. In patients with claudication the ankle mean pressure was 58 mmHg. In patients with rest pain it was 33 mmHg and in patients with chronic ulcerations it was 20 mmHg. In these 3 groups the mean ankle-foot pressure gradient was low (2-10 mmHg) were detected at the level of the iliaco-femoral and femora-popliteal segments. In the group of diabetic patients an high gradient was observed. Patients with peripheral arterial disease can be divided in four symptomatic groups but the angiographic and physiological patterns of patients with rest pain and ischemic ulcerations are similar and they are the best candidates to reconstructive arterial surgery.
