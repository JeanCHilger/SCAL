Delayed distal blood pressure rise after partial arterial reconstruction for combined aorto-iliac and superficial femoral artery occlusive disease. The blood pressure in the ankle and great toe was measured with cuff and strain-gauge technique in 39 patients after insertion of aorto-femoral bifurcation graft. In 40 limbs with patent superficial femoral artery (complete reconstruction) the distal blood pressure remained unchanged from the tenth postoperative day to follow-up after 12 to 26 months. In 30 limbs with occluded superficial femoral artery (partial reconstruction) the ankle/arm pressure index rose from 0.54 to 0.61 between the tenth day and late follow-up. The blood pressure in the great toe had increased by 8 mmHg on the tenth postoperative day and by additionally 17 mmHg during the next 12 to 26 months. The delayed pressure rise after partial arterial reconstruction presumably reflected development of collateral vessels from the deep femoral artery system. The clinical significance of the findings is discussed.
