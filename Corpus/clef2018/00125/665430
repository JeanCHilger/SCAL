Capillary fragility in elderly in-patients. Capillary fragility has been examined in 110 elderly patients, excluding those patients who might have been expected to have abnormal fragility. Nonetheless, fragility appeared to be greater in elderly patients than in younger subjects. It was much increased in the non-paralysed arm of hemiplegic patients but not in the paralysed arm--perhaps because petechiae were obscured by trophic changes. Capillary fragility was significantly correlated with systolic blood pressure but not with age. This suggests that higher values in elderly patients may be related to the high prevalence of arteriosclerosis rather than to age itself.
