Significance of Doppler ultrasound technique for screening postoperative deep venous thrombosis. In a prospective trial the Doppler ultrasound technique was evaluated for screening deep venous thrombosis on 84 "high risk" general surgical and urological patients, after major surgery. Patients were investigated by Fibrinogen Uptake Test (FUT) and clinical examination as well. Taking the screening accuracy of FUT as 100%, the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound technique was found to be 90.5%, twice that of the clinical examination (45.2%). Most of the dangerous, but clinically silent deep venous thromboses could be screened by regularly repeated ultrasound technique. However, neither bilateral thromboses, nor small thrombi of the calf could be demonstrated reliably, by this method.
