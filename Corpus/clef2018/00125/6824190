The acute effects of nifedipine on calf and forefoot blood flow in patients with peripheral arterial insufficiency. The calcium-blocking agent nifedipine, which possesses vasodilating potency, was tested in 8 patients with peripheral arterial insufficiency. 10 mg sublingually significantly decreased systolic arm and ankle blood pressure. Neither blood flow nor local peripheral resistance in the calf and the forefoot at rest and the calf during postischemic reactive hyperemia changed significantly. During postischemic hyperemia in the forefoot, the drug significantly reduced peak blood flow and increased local peripheral resistance. The drug-induced reduction in forefoot peak blood flow was correlated to the fall in systolic arm and ankle blood pressure. It is suggested that nifedipine may shorten the claudication distance in patients with peripheral arterial insufficiency.
