Acute ischemia of the lower limbs. Paraclinical non-invasive examination (arteries, veins, capillaries). The author defines the conditions under which vascular function studies may have a place in the presence of acute ischaemia of the lower limbs (essentially due to obstruction of a main artery). Ultrasound methods (Doppler, echography) seem to be the most valuable. Digital plethysmographic pulse and measurement of pO2 are used for the early surveillance of the results of treatment. Function studies should be a useful addition to clinical and angiographic findings within a vascular team, by improving estimation of the perfusion of the distal system taken as a whole.
