A comparative study of the use of fluorescein and the Doppler device in the determination of intestinal viability. Fluorescein is a reliable indicator of mucosal viability in dogs. This fact is probably applicable to humans. The Doppler device was not a reliable predictor of intestinal nonviability, and in the instance of mesenteric venous occlusion, with ischemic intestine, it was totally inaccurate in assessing intestinal viability. Short segments of intestine failing to take up fluorescein stain will retain viability, owing to the lesser nutrient requirements of resting smooth muscle. However, segments should not be used for anastomoses, since the mucosa will, to some degree be ischemic.
