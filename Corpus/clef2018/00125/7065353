Oxygen tension of the skin of ischemic legs. Using a Kontron Roche Transcutaneous Oxygen Monitor, we measured oxygen tension on the skin of the legs at three sites in patients with peripheral vascular disease and group of controls. Significant decreases in oxygen tension occurred in the patient groups, which correlated well with ankle systolic pressure, with differences between those with claudication and those with rest pain. These results suggest that in limbs with claudication, significant skin hypoxia may exist during rest in spite of reportedly normal skin and muscle blood flow. The progressive decrease in skin oxygen tension down a limb with occlusive vascular disease may play a significant role in skin healing.
