Haemodynamic and haemorheological effects of buflomedil in patients with peripheral occlusive arterial disease. The haemodynamic and haemorheological effects of buflomedil after acute intravenous infusion and after chronic treatment were studied in 25 patients with occlusive arterial diseases of the lower limbs. Acute treatment (100 mg) induced an increase in ankle blood pressure and in peripheral blood velocity, mainly of the continuous flow, as well as a significant decrease in blood viscosity and a significant increase (p less than 0.01) in red cell deformability, expressed as erythrocyte filtration flow. Chronic treatment (200 mg/day for 20 days) showed haemodynamic and haemorheological effects similar to those of the acute infusion, with a highly significant increase (p less than 0.001) in the erythrocyte flow at the end of the treatment period.
