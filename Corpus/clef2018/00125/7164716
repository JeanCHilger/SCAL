Musculotendinous pressure on the arteries of the knee observed in a patient with obstructive entrapment syndrome of the popliteal artery and vein. The knee artery entrapment is a consequence of congenital anatomical anomaly. As only a relatively small number of cases of this type of disease is quoted in medical literature it would appear to occur in only 0.4 percent of patients having calf claudication and more especially in youthful persons. It is possible that some patients being treated in our hospitals for other diagnosis do in fact belong to this group. It is difficult to distinguish the neglected cases of artery occlusion from some of other etiology. Angiographic examinations should be made immediately on the young patients having calf claudication and surgery to be effected in such cases. Extraordinary results are obtainable. A patient suffering from both artery and vein entrapment syndrome is presented. Subjective disturbances proved to be similar although patho-morphological changes were more visible on the right side. Histological section of dissected artery shows typical abnormal muscular arrangement.
