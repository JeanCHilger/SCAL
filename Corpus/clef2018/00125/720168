Extra-anatomical bypass in aorto-iliac obstruction. Our report describes the results of 35 extra-anatomic bypass operations for the treatment of aortoiliac occlusion in high-risk patients. This operation is an alternative to amputation for the therapy of claudication intermittens or gangrene. Long-term results are difficult to obtain, as many patients in this group die early from other causes. The problem of iatrogenic steal phenomenon is discussed. We consider Doppler ultrasound assessment a very valuable method for excluding aortoiliac insufficiency of the donor limb, not detected by other means.
