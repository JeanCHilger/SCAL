Effect of different stress tests on ankle blood pressure in patients with arterial circulatory disorders. Under normal conditions systolic ankle blood pressure exceeds that at the arm at rest and one minute after exercise, thus rendering the arm-ankle difference negative. In the presence of arterial obstructions this difference is positive at rest or becomes positive after exercise. To determine its value and applicability in a given case, several ways of stress testing have been compared. On average the increase in pressure difference produced by 100 m exercise on a treadmill ergometer over pressure difference at rest followed the equation: delta P100m = 1.53 delta PR + 24.8 mm Hg, r = 0.92. The increase after maximum or 200 m exercise and that after standardized tip-toeing was comparable. Postocclusive reactive hyperemia produced a smaller but still significant increase. When patients were compared after 100 m treadmill exercise, those with stenoses exhibited a greater increase than those with complete occlusions, even though the resting pressure difference was equal.
