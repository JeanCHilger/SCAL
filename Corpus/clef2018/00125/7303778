Evaluation of disordered peripheral hemodynamics after ergometric load. In 23 patients with arterial obstructive disease of type of femoropopliteal localization (stage I and II after Fontaine) comparative oscillographic and doppler-sonographic examinations were performed in rest and after standardized dynamic muscle work. Depending upon the haemodynamic importance of the present obstructions of the arterial system after load a significant increase of the systolic pressure gradient could be proved with decrease of the oscillometric indices. The determination of haemodynamic parameters after ergometric load serves to the objective judgment of the function in vascularly conditioned claudication and it is, moreover, important for the recognition of early changes (asymptomatic stage I). Load tests are indicated always in such cases when the findings under conditions of rest do not allow an unequivocal judgment or discrepancies between subjective functional capacity and ischaemically conditioned restriction of the function are to be supposed.
