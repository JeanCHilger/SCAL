Digital blood pressure and arteriographic findings under selective compression of the radial and ulnar arteries. In 50 normal subjects and in 45 limbs of 30 patients with obliterative arterial diseases of the extremities, digital blood pressure and arteriographic findings were observed during selective compression of the radial and ulnar arteries at the wrist. Determination of blood pressure in all fingers during arterial compression is useful for functional and quantitative evaluation of blood supply of the radial and ulnar arteries to the hand. Moreover, by this technique it may be possible to predict the risk of development of digital ischemia after radial artery cannulation and construction of an arteriovenous shunt. Arteriography during arterial compression is especially useful in patients with occlusion of the ulnar artery, in order to visualize accurately the site, size, and pattern of the obliteration and the degree of development of collateral circulation in the ulnar site.
