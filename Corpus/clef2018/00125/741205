Prevalence of primary Raynaud phenomena in young females. A questionnaire concerning Raynaud's phenomenon was sent to eighty-five females (aged 21--50 years) working as physical therapists at municipal hospitals in Copenhagen. Fifteen of sixty-seven healthy young females (22%, 95% confidence limits 13--34%) were classified as having Raynaud phenomena in its primary form. Twenty-four persons underwent a detailed clinical investigation with measurement of blood pressure at the arm and fingers with cuff techniques. Cold provocation test on one finger was carried out after moderate body cooling. Of eight subjects being classified from the questionnaire as having Raynaud phenomena, six showed closure of the digital arteries at the local cold provocation, and all had an exaggerated response. A group complaining of cold fingers showed a greater reduction in finger blood pressure during local cooling than the normal group, but none showed closure. A questionnaire can separate the groups if Raynaud phenomena is defined by appearance of white and dead fingers on cold exposure with frequent cold or bluish fingers.
