Detection of postoperative deep venous thromboses. In 227 patients undergoing abdominal surgery, a Doppler ultrasonic examination to measure venous stop flow pressure and a 125I-fibrinogen test were systematically performed in order to detect postoperative deep venous thrombosis of the lower limbs (DVT). The 125I-fibrinogen test was abnormal in 19 patients in whom venography showed DVT in 18 cases (16 calf DVT and 2 femoral DVT). Five pulmonary embolisms were detected by lung scanning: lower limb venography was normal in one patient, calf DVT was found in 2 and femoral DVT in the last 2 patients. Among the 18 DVT, measurement of venous stop flow pressure by Doppler technique was abnormal in 4 cases including the 2 femoral DVT. This study confirms the value of the 125I-fibrinogen test in detecting asymptomatic postoperative DVT. The Doppler method serves to detect clinically symptomatic DVT with extension above the knee.
