Does vascular steal occur following femorofemoral bypass grafting? Vascular steal has been reported following aortoiliac and crossover femoral vascular reconstruction. Although the steal phenomenon has been described in clinical situations some have denied its existence. The authors attempted to determine whether or not vascular steal occurs after femorofemoral bypass operation. Fifteen adult mongrel dogs underwent femorofemoral bypass grafting. Stenosis of the iliac artery was simulated with a specially designed device. Blood flow was measured with the femoral graft open and closed in combination with superficial femoral and deep femoral artery obstruction in the donor and recipient circulations. There was no statistically significant decrease in flow to the donor leg in any situation. Thus the authors conclude that vascular steal does not occur following femorofemoral bypass operation.
