Intramuscular administration of vascular endothelial growth factor induces dose-dependent collateral artery augmentation in a rabbit model of chronic limb ischemia. Despite major advances in both surgical and percutaneous revascularization techniques, limb salvage and relief of ischemic pain cannot be achieved in many patients with diffuse peripheral vascular disease. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a heparin-binding, endothelial cell-specific mitogen. Previous studies have suggested that VEGF is a regulator of naturally occurring physiological and pathological angiogenesis. In this study, the therapeutic potential of intramuscularly administered VEGF was investigated in a rabbit model of chronic hindlimb ischemia.Ischemia was induced in the hindlimb of 24 New Zealand White rabbits by ligation of the distal external iliac artery and complete excision of the femoral artery. Ten days after the induction of limb ischemia (day 0), saline (group A, n = 7) or the 165-amino acid isoform of recombinant human VEGF (group B: 200 micrograms, n = 6 group C: 500 micrograms, n = 7These findings demonstrate a significant dose-dependent augmentation in limb perfusion accompanied by evidence of increased collateral formation after intramuscular administration of VEGF in ischemic rabbit hindlimbs. This study thus supports the hypothesis that administration of VEGF to stimulate angiogenesis may represent a new therapeutic modality in the management of arterial insufficiency.
