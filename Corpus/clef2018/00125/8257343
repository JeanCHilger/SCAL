Duplex sonography in detection of renal artery stenosis: a simplified approach using new parameters. A case report illustrating a new investigation for detecting renal artery stenosis (RAS) is reported. Colour Doppler ultrasound evaluation of the readily accessible intrarenal arteries is a fast and accurate technique. Acceleration time and acceleration are the Doppler parameters used for measuring systolic upstroke on the waveforms obtained. Prolonged acceleration time (> or = 0.07s) and diminished acceleration (< or = 3 m/s2) indicate haemodynamically significant stenosis. Intrarenal Doppler ultrasound should provide a safe noninvasive screening examination for the detection of RAS.
