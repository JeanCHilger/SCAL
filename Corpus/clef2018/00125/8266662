The use of magnetics and laser therapy in treating obliterating vascular diseases of the extremities. The paper presents the results of treatment received by 60 patients suffering from lower limb vascular obliteration stage IIA-III. The treatment involved combined use of magnetic field and laser irradiation. Peripheral circulation and central hemodynamics were evaluated rheographically and using ultrasound Doppler sphygmomanometry. Combined application of the above two modalities produced a greater effect on central hemodynamics compared to them introduced alone.
