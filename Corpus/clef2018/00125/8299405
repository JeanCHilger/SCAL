Disodium-ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) has no effect on blood lipids in atherosclerotic patients. A randomized, placebo-controlled study. To study whether intravenous disodium-ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) affects blood lipids in patients with intermittent claudication.Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.Twenty-nine patients with intermittent claudication (systolic ankle-brachial blood pressure index < 0.8 pain free walking distance 50-200 m).3 g EDTA or placebo (isotonic saline) per infusion over a period of 5-9 weeks to a total of 57 g EDTA. Patients received vitamins, minerals and trace-elements daily.14 patients received EDTA and 15 placebo. There was no statistically significant difference in the plasma concentration of cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol or triglyceride between the 2 groups.Treatment with EDTA does not alter blood lipids in patients with intermittent claudication.
