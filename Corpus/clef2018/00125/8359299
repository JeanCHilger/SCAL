Chronic critical leg ischaemia must be redefined. The Second European Consensus Document on Chronic Critical Leg Ischaemia defines critical limb ischaemia in non-diabetic patients as rest pain or tissue necrosis (ulceration or gangrene) with an ankle systolic pressure (ASP) of less than or equal to 50 mmHg, or a toe pressure of less than or equal to 30 mmHg. The aim of this study was to investigate whether this definition is able to predict the outcome of patients with severe lower limb ischaemia and thus to determine the relevance of the definition in clinical practice. We have analysed 148 severely ischaemic limbs in 133 non-diabetic patients who presented with rest pain, tissue necrosis or a combination of these symptoms. Fifty-one percent of these limbs fulfilled the current definition with an ASP < or = 50 mmHg 49% had an ASP > 50 mmHg and were thus not defined as critically ischaemic according to the current definition. We have compared actuarial limb salvage and mortality rates in patients with an ASP < or = 50 mmHg to those patients with an ASP > 50 mmHg. The 1 year limb salvage and mortality rates for ischaemic limbs fulfilling the European Consensus Document criteria were 78.7 and 36.7% respectively, compared to rates of 73.9 and 17.3% in patients who were not defined as critically ischaemic under the current definition. There were no significant differences between 1 year limb salvage or mortality rates between the two patients groups (p = 0.843, 0.078, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
