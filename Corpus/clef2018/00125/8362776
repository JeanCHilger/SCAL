Transcatheter occlusion of patent ductus arteriosus in adults. This study examines whether transcatheter closure of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) using a Rashkind PDA occluder device is safe and effective in adults, or if adults have complications not sited in children owing to prolonged aorticopulmonary communication, high surgical risks or calcified PDAs. Fifteen patients aged 22 to 76 years (mean 42 +/- 14) were referred for transcatheter PDA occlusion. Exercise intolerance was the most frequent clinical manifestation. Eleven of 15 patients had surgical risk factors that included left ventricular failure (n = 10), biventricular failure (n = 1), elevated pulmonary pressures (n = 1), and a calcified PDA (n = 5). Twelve millimeter devices were placed in 4 PDAs < or = 3 mm in diameter 17 mm devices were placed in 11 PDAs 3 to 6 mm in diameter. Seven (47%) were occluded angiographically shortly after device placement
