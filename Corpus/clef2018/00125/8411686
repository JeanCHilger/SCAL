Arteriosclerosis obliterans. Arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO) has become one of major health problems in the elderly people in Japan. This paper reviews the recent progress in the diagnosis and treatment of ASO. Both medical and surgical treatments, such as atherectomy catheters, endovascular metallic stenting, laser angioplasty and LDL-apheresis have recently been greatly developed. As atherosclerosis is a generalised disease, patients with ASO tend to have other atherosclerotic diseases, i.e., cerebrovascular disease, coronary heart disease and renal vascular disease. For the selection of treatments, we have to consider the whole background of the patients, including a quality of life.
