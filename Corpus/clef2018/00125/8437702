Transcranial Doppler assessment of cerebral perfusion reserve in patients with carotid occlusive disease and no evidence of cerebral infarction. Using transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD), we measured bilateral middle cerebral artery mean blood flow velocities (MCAVs) before and 10 minutes after intravenous infusion of 1 gram of acetazolamide in 20 patients without cerebral infarction. Seven patients had normal carotid arteries (group 1), seven had unilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis > or = 75% (group 2), and six had unilateral ICA occlusion (group 3). Before acetazolamide infusion, side-to-side differences in MCAV were 0.06 cm/sec in group 1 (p = 0.98), 4.3 cm/sec in group 2 (p = 0.36), and 15.0 cm/sec in group 3 (p = 0.02). Bilateral MCAV increased in all three groups after acetazolamide infusion, and the side-to-side differences in MCAV were 3.2 cm/sec in group 1 (p = 0.40), 11.4 cm/sec in group 2 (p = 0.04), and 27.6 cm/sec in group 3 (p = 0.03). Patients with carotid stenosis or occlusion and ipsilateral transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) had higher side-to-side differences in MCAV before (p = 0.03) and after (p = 0.01) acetazolamide than did asymptomatic patients with carotid disease. The association of impaired cerebral perfusion reserve and TIAs suggests that the TCD-acetazolamide test may enable identification of a subgroup of patients with carotid occlusive disease who are at higher risk for stroke.
