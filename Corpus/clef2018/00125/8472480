Duplex Doppler detection of hepatic artery thrombosis following liver transplantation. Hepatic artery thrombosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality following liver transplantation. We assessed the value of prospective duplex Doppler ultrasound in detecting hepatic artery thrombosis. One hundred consecutive transplants in 90 patients were studied. Duplex Doppler detected all 10 proven cases of hepatic artery thrombosis. No case of hepatic artery thrombosis was found with a normal duplex study. All arteriograms performed following an abnormal ultrasound demonstrated hepatic arterial occlusion or anastomotic stenosis or a segment of irregular arterial narrowing. We conclude that duplex Doppler is a practical and sensitive method of selecting patients with a presumptive diagnosis of hepatic artery thrombosis for further investigation by angiography.
