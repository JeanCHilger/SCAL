Low target birth weight or growth retardation? Umbilical Doppler flow velocity waveforms and histometric analysis of fetoplacental vascular tree. The placental vascular architecture of small-for-gestational-age fetuses seems to have an impact on the flow patterns in the umbilical arteries.Blood flow velocity waveforms of the umbilical arteries were measured by Doppler ultrasonography in nine small-for-gestational-age fetuses with elevated systolic/diastolic ratios of the umbilical arteries, seven small-for-gestational-age fetuses with normal flow patterns, and 14 appropriate-for-gestational-age fetuses with normal flow patterns. After delivery histomorphometric placental investigations were performed.Reduced end-diastolic flow velocities were significantly associated with both a reduction of vascularization within the terminal villi and adverse diffusion conditions, indicating insufficient functional maturity. The perfusion and diffusion capacity of small-for-gestational-age placentas with normal umbilical artery flow velocity waveforms was similar or even slightly better compared with the appropriate-for-gestational-age control values.These data suggest that Doppler flow velocimetry in the umbilical arteries is predictive of a vascular lesion within the placentas of small-for-gestational-age fetuses.
