Evaluation of indirect blood pressure measurement as a method of assessment of peripheral vascular disease. In over 200 patients with peripheral vascular disease, pressure index (formula: see text) was compared with radiological grade although calf P.I. had a better correlation, there was wide overlap between the groups. In 28 patients, resting calf P.I. was compared with functional impairment measured on a treadmill. At two rates of exercise, calf P.I. correlated poorly with functional impairment. In 35 patients, reproducibility of indirect pressure measurement was assessed
