Xanthine oxidase mediates cyclic flow variations in a canine model of coronary arterial thrombosis. We investigated the hypothesis that xanthine oxidase (XO) mediates platelet aggregation and cyclic flow variations (CFVs) in stenosed canine coronary arteries. CFVs were produced by an external constrictor placed at the site of the coronary artery with the injured endothelium. The severity of CFVs was evaluated by a pulsed Doppler flow probe. If CFVs developed, dogs intravenously received allopurinol, a specific XO inhibitor. The transcardiac gradient (difference between coronary vein and left atrium) of purine metabolites was determined during CFVs and after allopurinol administration. Allopurinol significantly reduced CFVs (from 8 +/- 1 to 1 +/- 1 cycles/h, P < 0.01, n = 14), whereas saline did not (from 8 +/- 1 to 7 +/- 1 cycles/h, n = 7). In seven dogs with CFVs, the transcardiac gradient of xanthine and uric acid concentrations significantly increased after the establishment of CFVs and significantly decreased after the administration of allopurinol. In vitro platelet studies showed that XO enhanced (from 30.9 +/- 2.0 to 47.6 +/- 1.5%, P < 0.0001, n = 10) and allopurinol inhibited ADP-induced platelet aggregation (from 48.3 +/- 1.3 to 24.8 +/- 1.5%, P < 0.0001, n = 10). Our results indicate that allopurinol inhibits platelet aggregation in vitro and provides a protection against CFVs in vivo. Thus XO may be an important mediator in this model.
