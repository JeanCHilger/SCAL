Carotid calcifications on panoramic radiography identify an asymptomatic male patient at risk for stroke. A case report. Although stroke may be preventable, a major challenge is to find effective methods of detection of stroke-prone patients. Most noncardiogenic strokes occur as a result of atherosclerosis involving the proximal internal carotid artery, calcifications of which can be detected on dental panoramic radiography. This report describes the case of an asymptomatic patient whose dental radiographic findings led to carotid endarterectomy. Calcifications were viewed bilaterally in the soft tissues of the neck in the area of the carotid bifurcation on a screening panoramic radiograph of an asymptomatic 75-year-old man. Subsequent duplex Doppler ultrasound revealed extensive atherosclerotic changes bilaterally with critical stenosis (90%+) in the right internal carotid artery. Carotid digital subtraction angiography revealed a 95%+ stenosis at the origin of the right internal carotid artery. The patient underwent right carotid endarterectomy involving the internal, external, and common carotid arteries. Twelve months later the patient was alive and well. Dental panoramic radiography represents a useful imaging modality for detection of some asymptomatic stroke-prone patients. Identification of calcifications in the area of a patient's carotid vasculature should prompt expeditious referral to a physician for a cerebrovascular and cardiovascular work-up as part of an active stroke prevention strategy.
