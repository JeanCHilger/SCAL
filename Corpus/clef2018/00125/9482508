Percutaneous excimer laser angioplasty of lower limb vessels: results of a prospective 24-month follow-up. The aim of this prospective study was to assess the effectiveness and the long-term patency effect of excimer laser angioplasty in peripheral arterial obstructive disease. Seventy-eight patients referred for excimer laser angioplasty of lower limbs have been followed up for up to 24 months. Ankle/brachial systolic pressure index, color Doppler mapping, and arterial digital subtraction angiography were performed. Immediate procedural success was achieved in a high percentage of patients (97%). Balloon angioplasty was also used in 85% of patients. Early reocclusions occurred in 8% of patients. The cumulative patency rate was 47% at the 12-month interval and 40% at the 24-month interval. Poor runoff and the length of the lesions negatively influenced the outcome. Excimer laser angioplasty is an effective procedure, indicated in selected patients showing < 10 cm occlusions and good runoff.
