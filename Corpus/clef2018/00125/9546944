Effect of felodipine on regional blood supply and collateral vascular resistance in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease. This double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study was designed to investigate the acute effect of felodipine on regional blood supply and collateral vascular resistance in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD). Thirty men with PAOD were treated with a single dose of 5 mg felodipine or placebo. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), Doppler ankle pressure (DAP), calf blood flow (CBF) by venous occlusion plethysmography and calf transcutaneous oxygen tension (tcpO2) were measured during a cycle ergometry. Felodipine reduced SBP significantly (from 149 to 136 mmHg, p < 0.05), while placebo did not. DAP increased slightly but not significantly in both groups. The pressure gradient between SBP and DAP fell significantly in the felodipine group (60 vs 39 mmHg, p < 0.01) but not in the placebo group (59 vs 56 mmHg). There was a trend for lower velocity in tcpO2 decrease during the stress test and higher velocity of tcpO2 increase during recovery from exercise in the felodipine group although the differences between both groups were not significant. In the felodipine group, CBF increased by 35.6% (p < 0.05) whereas it did not change in the placebo group. In conclusion, while lowering SBP, felodipine increased slightly, or at least maintained, the blood supply to the calves in PAOD patients, which probably results from reducing collateral vascular resistance.
