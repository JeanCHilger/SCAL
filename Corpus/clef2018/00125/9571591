Pulsed wave and color Doppler echocardiography and cardiac catheterization findings in bilateral pulmonary vein stenosis. Pulmonary vein stenosis is a rare condition that usually is congenital in origin it is almost invariably fatal in its bilateral and severe forms. It is often overlooked, however, during clinical examination, routine echocardiography, and even at cardiac catheterization. This report describes the pulsed Doppler, color flow echocardiography, and hemodynamic findings of bilateral pulmonary vein stenosis that accompany ventricular septal defect and atrial septal defect corrected by surgery.
