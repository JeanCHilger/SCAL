Evaluation of functional importance of coronary artery stenosis by intracoronary Doppler blood flow velocity measurement. Intracoronary doppler blood flow velocity measurements supply important information for clinical decision making during angioplasty, especially with regard to stenoses of ambiguous severity. In the presence of an intermediate stenosis of unknown physiological impact (40-60%), determination of normal flow parameters (coronary flow reserve: CFR, diastolic to systolic velocity ratio: DSVR and proximal to distal velocity ratio: P/D) will make deferment of treatment acceptable. Post-angioplasty success can be based on restoral of normal flowparameters. The inability to achieve normal CFR immediately after angioplasty does not indicate an unsuccessful procedure, it remains to be shown whether a lack of normalization of DSVR and/or P/D does so. Continuous post-lesional flow monitoring can show and quantify the existence of collateral flow.
