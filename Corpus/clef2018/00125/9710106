Capillary refilling time and hemodynamics in neonates: a Doppler echocardiographic evaluation. To evaluate the correlation of the capillary refilling time measured in neonates with the hemodynamic parameters obtained by Doppler echocardiography.Prospective study.Neonatal intensive care unit (ICU) in a university hospital.Neonates without congenital cardiac disease admitted to the neonatal ICU (n = 100).None.The clinical parameters obtained were: heart rate blood pressureThe capillary refilling time was significantly linked to cardiac index in neonates.
