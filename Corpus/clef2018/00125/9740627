Relation between number of cardiovascular risk factors/events and noninvasive Doppler ultrasound assessments of aortic compliance. The aim of this study was to establish the relation between noninvasive Doppler ultrasound assessments of aortic compliance, based on "foot-to-foot" aortic pulse wave velocity measurements, and presumed atherosclerotic load in patients with vascular disease and/or diabetes mellitus. One hundred ten patients with vascular disease and/or diabetes mellitus (arteriopaths) underwent measurement of in vivo aortic compliance using Doppler ultrasound. Demographic data on these subjects were recorded along with details of cardiovascular risk factors and events. Aortic compliance values were compared with data from 51 age-matched healthy, asymptomatic subjects putatively free of vascular disease (controls). Data are expressed as mean+/-SD. Arteriopaths were aged 64.1+/-8.4 years and had total cholesterol levels of 5.9+/-1.1 mmol/L and aortic compliance of 0.78+/-0.42%/10 mm Hg [1.33 kPa]. Most arteriopaths had 2 or more cardiovascular risk factors and events: diabetes (n=41), hypertension (n=45), smoking (n=86), cerebrovascular/transient ischemic event (n=13), myocardial infarction (n=44), angina (n=51), and/or peripheral vascular disease (n=33). Controls were aged 64.3+/-12.1 years with total cholesterol of 6.1+/-1.1 mmol/L and aortic compliance of 1.14+/-0.46%/10 mm Hg [1.33 kPa] (P<0.002 versus arteriopaths). Subset analysis revealed that patients with the greatest number of cardiovascular risk factors and events (n=5) had the stiffest aortas (aortic compliance, 0.58+/-0.15%/10 mm Hg [1.33 kPa]) compared with those patients with the median and mean (n=2) number of risk factors and events (aortic compliance, 0.80+/-0.50%/10 mm Hg [1.33 kPa] P<0.02). The data suggest that a significant inverse relation exists between presumed atherosclerotic load (as assessed by the number of cardiovascular risk factors and events) and aortic compliance determined noninvasively based on aortic pulse wave velocity measurements. If these findings are confirmed by prospective, longitudinal follow-up studies, such measurements may prove useful as a noninvasive marker of vascular risk.
