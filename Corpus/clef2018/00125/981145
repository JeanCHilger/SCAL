Simplified monitoring by ultrasound for anaesthesiology. This is the description of a simplified method to assist the anaesthesiologist in monitoring and/or detecting venous and arterial diseases (i.e. stenosis) by ultrasound. The main problem for the anaesthesiologist is to monitor and measure the low blood pressure of new-borns during intra- and post-operative phases. In most cases it is difficult to localize the systolic pressure. We have developed a new device which, in connection with an analogic ratemeter, displays the heart rate based on the ultrasound doppler effect. Technique, application and first results are described.
