Quality of life and peripheral obliterative arteriopathy. Perspective for the future. Atherosclerosis is the primary cause of peripheral arterial disease. Because atherosclerosis is a generalised disease, it is possible that patients with peripheral arterial disease may have other arterial disorders. Such patients have a reasonable chance of continuing to walk, although their general prognosis is less favourable because of high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Nevertheless, the following approaches can be used to improve the management of patients with peripheral arterial disease: diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease in its early stages by systematic measurement of the ankle/brachial index improvement in screening for lesions in other arteries by analysing the clinical symptomatology and performing simple complementary examinations
