Cross-sectional and 4-year longitudinal associations between brachial pulse pressure and common carotid intima-media thickness in a general population. The EVA study. The cross-sectional and 4-year longitudinal associations between brachial pulse pressure (PP) and ultrasound measurements of common carotid intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT) were assessed.A population of 957 volunteers aged 59 to 71 years was recruited from the electoral rolls of the city of Nantes (western France) and reexamined 4 years later. Longitudinal changes in PP and CCA-IMT were computed as the difference between 4-year follow-up and baseline values.Baseline CCA-IMT and PP were positively associated in both age- and sex-adjusted analysis (partial correlation coefficient=0.20, P<0.001) and in multivariate analysis adjusted for traditional cardiovascular risk factors and mean blood pressure (partial correlation coefficient=0.18, P<0.001). In longitudinal analysis, baseline PP was associated with the change in 4-year CCA-IMT (partial correlation coefficient=0.11, P<0.001), and baseline CCA-IMT was a predictor of the 4-year change in PP (partial correlation coefficient=0.10, 0.001<P<0.01). No association between mean blood pressure and CCA-IMT was observed once PP was taken into account, in either cross-sectional or longitudinal analyses (partial correlation coefficients ranged from 0.00 to 0.03). Similar patterns of results were observed in hypertensive, nonhypertensive, and antihypertensive-treated and -nontreated subjects.This longitudinal study of a large population of relatively aged subjects suggests that elevated levels of PP are associated with the progression of CCA-IMT, and increased CCA-IMT is associated with PP widening. The nature of these relationships and whether atherosclerosis progression over time is involved or not in these associations merit further investigations.
