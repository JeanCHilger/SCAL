Transvaginal sonohysterography and hysteroscopy in the evaluation of female infertility, habitual abortion or metrorrhagia. A comparative study. To assess the diagnostic value of sonohysterography in the evaluation of metrorrhagia and infertility with hysteroscopy as the standard.Sixty-six women, 41 with metrorrhagia, 20 with infertility and five with habitual abortion, were examined by sonohysterography and hysteroscopy. Sterile saline instilled through a baby-feeding tube was used to distend the uterine cavity during sonohysterography. Hysteroscopy was performed with a 4 mm hysteroscope under general anesthesia. The endometrial polyps and submucous myomas were recorded and the findings subsequently compared.Of the 66 women, 60 were successfully examined by both sonohysterography and hysteroscopy. The overall sensitivity and specificity for sonohysterography was 90.9% and 100%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values were 100% and 90%, respectively. When examining the metrorrhagia and infertility groups separately the sensitivity and specificity and predictive values were found to be 88.5%, 100%, 100% and 76.9% (metrorrhagia) and 100% for all parameters in cases of infertility. No complications were recorded during the procedures.Sonohysterography is a simple, fast, well tolerated and accurate method to evaluate the uterine cavity in patients with metrorrhagia or infertility.
