Aortic valve replacement after retrosternal gastric tube reconstruction for esophageal cancer. A 59-year-old man with a history of the thoraco-abdominal esophagus resection with retrosternal gastric tube reconstruction for esophageal cancer complicated by anastomosis leakage and purulent pericarditis was admitted for aortic regurgitation due to infective endocarditis. Floppy vegetation and worsening cardiac failure indicated aortic valve replacement. In a median sternotomy approach, the thickest adhesion between the cervical esophagus and posterior surface of the manubrium sternae was freed using an ultrasonic osteotome. Severe adhesions in the pericardium due to purulent pericarditis were found. Median sternotomy enabled minimal exposure of the aortic root, upper right atrium, and right superior pulmonary vein for instituting extracorporeal circulation and replacing the aortic valve. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful. For cardiac surgery in patients with a retrosternal gastric tube, left anterior or right thoracotomy may be considered to avoid gastric tube injury. Median sternotomy, however, is an alternative enabling safe heart exposure, and the ultrasonic osteotome was very useful in incising the sternum without injuring the cervical esophagus, which had no serosa.
