Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of peripheral bypass stenoses. To assess the success of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in treating peripheral bypass stenoses.Patients who received a femoropopliteal or femorocrural bypass graft for limb ischemia were included in a duplex surveillance program. If duplex ultrasound revealed a short (<2 cm) severe (peak systolic velocity ratio >/= 4.5) stenosis, patients were scheduled for arteriography and PTA. Fifty-eight peripheral bypass stenoses in 39 grafts in 37 patients were treated with PTA. The cumulative primary patency of treated stenoses was calculated.During the first year after PTA 31 (53%) treated lesions remained patent, 15 (26%) lesions restenosed at a median interval of 5.0 (range 1-12) months and 4 (7%) bypasses occluded. The cumulative primary patency of 58 treated graft stenoses at 1 year was 60% [95% confidence interval (CI) 46%-74%] and 55% (95% CI 41%-70%) at 2 years. Graft body stenoses showed a better 2-year cumulative primary patency (86% 95% CI 68%-100%) compared with juxta-anastomotic lesions (45%PTA is justifiable as the initial treatment of peripheral bypass stenoses. Nevertheless, the restenosis rate is rather high, especially in juxta-anastomotic lesions. Continuation of duplex surveillance after PTA and timely reintervention is recommended.
