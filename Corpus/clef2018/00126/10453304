Recent advances in the placement of tubes for enteral nutrition. Enteral nutrition is the preferred route for nutritional support compared with parenteral nutrition if the gastrointestinal tract is functionally preserved. Long-standing nasogastric or nasoenteric feeding tubes are not well tolerated. Alternative routes are gastrostomy and jejunostomy. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy/jejunostomy or those guided by fluoroscopy, sonography or tomography should be the first choices. Laparoscopy or laparotomy gastrostomy/jejunostomy routes should be reserved for specific situations. Insufflation of the stomach with air or saline solution facilitates the placement of nasoenteric feeding tubes or percutaneous sonographic-guided gastrostomy. The gastrostomy button is a safe and aesthetic alternative, at least in children. Comparison between percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy and surgical gastrostomy performed either via laparotomy or laparoscopy favours the first in terms of costs and risks. Whenever associated intra-abdominal procedures or anatomic difficulties arise, a laparoscopic or an open access becomes necessary. Complications with feeding tubes are not uncommon and should be promptly recognized and treated.
