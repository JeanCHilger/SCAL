Complete recovery after spontaneous drainage of pancreatic abscess into the stomach. Pancreatic abscess is a dreaded complication of acute pancreatitis, with a high death rate even with aggressive surgical treatment. We report two cases in which recovery followed spontaneous drainage into the stomach. A 75-year-old woman with biliary pancreatitis and a 63-year-old man with ethanol-induced pancreatitis both developed pancreatic abscess, diagnosed by computed tomography scans and ultrasound. The spontaneous gastric fistula was heralded by a large emesis of purulent and necrotic material in one case and copious nasogastric tube secretions of a similar material in the other. Defervescence was immediate, and both patients went on to complete recovery without any further interventions. Contrast studies showed the fistulae. It is concluded that in the event that a pancreatic pseudocyst spontaneously drains into the stomach a 'wait and see' policy should be adopted, and a favorable outcome can be expected.
