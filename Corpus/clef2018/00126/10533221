Evaluation of functional potentials of microcirculation in patients with obliterating diseases of lower limb vessels. An analysis of the data of laser doppler fluorometry in 136 patients has shown that different obliterating diseases have different typical fluorometric features of changes in microcirculation. Results of the postischemic test are of greater informative value in the noninvasive assessment of the functional state of microcirculation. The significance of the functional tests was particularly increasing in critical ischemia of the lower extremities. The intraoperative determination of the muscle blood flow allowed performing the control of the lower extremity revascularization and determining the optimum level of amputation.
