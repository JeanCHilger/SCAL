Surgical treatment of patients with critical ischemia of the lower limbs of atherosclerotic etiology. The authors analyze the results of conservative and operative treatment of 546 patients. The results of operative treatment (reconstructive operations on the arteries, osteo-trepanation) were shown to be considerably better in cases of critical ischemia than those of conservative treatment (infusion therapy, hemodilution, plasmapheresis).
