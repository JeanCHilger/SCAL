Neuroprotective effects of the novel brain-penetrating antioxidant U-101033E and the spin-trapping agent alpha-phenyl-N-tert-butyl nitrone (PBN). Literature on the therapeutic efficacy of free radical scavengers suggests that drugs that are able to cross the blood-brain barrier are more effective in protecting the brain from ischemic damage. However, the exact mechanisms by which brain-penetrating antioxidants act have yet not been delineated. We compared the neuroprotective potential of the newly discovered pyrrolopyrimidine U-101033E with that of alpha-phenyl-N-tert-butyl nitrone (PBN) and investigated their influence on cerebral blood flow. Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 90 min of middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion by an intraluminal filament. Local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) was bilaterally recorded by laser Doppler flowmetry. Neurological deficits were quantified daily. Infarct volume was assessed after 7 days. MCA occlusion reduced ipsilateral LCBF to 20-30% of baseline. After reperfusion, postischemic hyperemia was followed by a decrease in LCBF to about 70% of baseline. There was no difference in LCBF among groups. U-101033E improved neurological function and reduced infarct volume by 52% (P < 0.05). Improvement of neurological function and reduction of infarct volume (-25%) in animals treated with PBN was not significant. We conclude that U-101033E has superior neuroprotective properties compared with PBN. Neither drug improves blood flow during ischemia and 1 h of reperfusion. The mechanisms by which these brain-penetrating antioxidants act remain to be clarified.
