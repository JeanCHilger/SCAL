Optimum intermittent pneumatic compression stimulus for lower-limb venous emptying. intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) of the foot (IPC(foot)), calf (IPC(calf)) or both (IPC(foot+calf)) augments calf inflow, and improves the walking ability and peripheral haemodynamics of claudicants (IPC(foot), IPC(foot+calf)), largely due to venous outflow enhancement. This cohort study, using direct pressure measurements in healthy limbs, determines the optimal combination of frequency (2-4 impulses/minute), applied pressure (60-140 mmHg), mode (IPC(foot)-IPC(calf)-IPC(foot+calf)) and delay time of calf-to-foot impulse (0 s-0.5 s-1 s) that enables IPC to generate an almost complete and sustained decrease in venous pressure.(a) IPC(foot)at 120 and 80 mmHg generated lower venous pressure than that with 100 and 60 mmHg (p=0.036) respectively, for 2-4 impulses/minute venous pressure differences between applied pressures of 140 and 120 mmHg or between 80 and 100 mmHg were insignificant. (b) Venous pressure with IPC(calf)at 80 mmHg was lower than that with 60 mmHg (p=0.036) (2-4 cycles/minute)IPC(foot+calf)at applied 120-140 mmHg, a frequency of 3-4 impulses/minute and one-second delay, provided the optimum intermittent pneumatic stimulus.
