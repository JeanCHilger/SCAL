Early postoperative diagnostic management by arterial-reobstruction after vascular operations using the ultrasonic flowmeter (author's transl). The Doppler ultrasonic method can confirm the success of the operation in the early post-operative phase after reconstructive vascular operations as an essential non-invasive technique or clear a doubtful improvement of the blood flow. Thus an arteriography can be indicated in good time. On the basis of reconstructive cases the usefulness and the advantageous application of the Doppler ultrasonic flowmeter in the operating theater is demonstrated.
