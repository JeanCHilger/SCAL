Mallory-Weiss tear following cardiac surgery: transoesophageal echoprobe or nasogastric tube? A case of fatal upper gastrointestinal bleeding from a Mallory-Weiss tear after transoesophageal echocardiography during cardiac surgery is reported. After the echo-cardiographic examination, which is considered a safe procedure, a nasogastric tube was inserted which immediately revealed bright red blood. Eventually the patient lost 9 litres of blood. The role of the echo-probe and the nasogastric tube in causing the Mallory-Weiss tear is discussed. Although this case is not conclusive about the mechanism of oesophageal damage, it is suggested that the safety recommendations for transoesophageal echocardiography also apply for instrumentation of the oesophagus with a nasogastric tube after the transoesophageal echocardiographic examination.
