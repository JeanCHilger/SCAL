Contrast-enhanced Doppler ultrasound for renal artery stenosis. The use of renal artery Doppler ultrasound for the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis is a well-established technique in selected populations, but the technical failure rate of the examination leading to incomplete studies is a major drawback. The results of ultrasound contrast-enhanced renal artery Doppler for renal artery stenosis, using the echo-enhancing agent, Levovist, are reported here. Sixteen patients (22 arteries) were examined with Levovist. The technical success rate of these examinations was 91%, and all four renal artery stenoses were correctly identified. It is concluded that the use of ultrasound contrast (Levovist) increases the technical success rate of renal artery Doppler ultrasound in this setting, with similar accuracy to unenhanced Doppler examinations.
