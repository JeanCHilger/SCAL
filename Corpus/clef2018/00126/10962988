Evaluation of renal artery stenosis: comparison of angiography and invasive blood pressure measurement and Doppler ultrasound. In the procedure of renal artery angioplasty, the angiographically measured degree of stenosis should be compared with the intraarterial transstenotic blood pressure gradient and pre-interventional Doppler findings.In a total of 46 renal arteries in 35 patients with renovascular hypertension, the angiographic-morphological parameters: "linear", "geometric" and "densitometric" degree of stenosis are compared with the invasive transstenotic blood pressure gradient and the pre-interventional Doppler ultrasound.All angiographically determined degrees of stenosis ("linear", "geometric" and "densitometric") correlate--moderately--with the transstenotic blood pressure gradient (correlation coefficients: 0.67 ("linear"), 0.65 ("geometric") and 0.49 ("densitometric"), each versus systolic pressure gradient, respectively). Stenoses that are angiographically classified as "low grade" (< 50%) nevertheless have a high number of high transstenotic pressure gradients: 21 of 22 show systolic values > or = 10 mmHg, 13 of 22 even > or = 30 mmHg. All stenoses Doppler sonographically classified as "high or very high grade" (Vmax,syst > or = 3 m/s) are confirmed by angiography and/or pressure measurement.Angiography has the tendency to underestimate the degree of renal artery stenosis, especially in "low grade" stenoses (< 50%). However, in those > or = 50% a high transstenotic blood pressure gradient can be taken for granted. If the angiographic degree of stenosis seems uncertain, we recommend measurement of blood pressure gradient.
