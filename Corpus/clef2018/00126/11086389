Hemodynamics of the lower extremities in patients with decubitus ulcers using the ultrasonic Doppler method. Our clinical experience indicates that decubitus ulcers with tissue loss/necrosis extending beyond the subcutaneous fat in aged patients are liable to become refractory and that most of these patients experience a cold feeling/cyanosis in the lower extremities. In order to determine the relationship between the severity of the decubitus ulcers and the hemodynamics in the lower extremities, we conducted a blood flow test using the ultrasonic Doppler method on the lower extremities in patients. Sixty-eight inpatients (38 men, 30 women, with an average age of 80.5 +/- 7.6 years old) were selected. B-mode tomographs were obtained with an ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus. The power Doppler method was used to measure blood flow rate, vascular lumen diameter, and intravascular blood flow at the dorsalis pedis artery, posterior tibial artery, peroneal artery furcation, and femoral artery. The subjects were divided into three groups: patients without decubitus ulcers patients with mild to moderate decubitus ulcers of IAET Classification grade I-III
