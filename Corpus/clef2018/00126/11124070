Comparison of Doppler ultrasound, magnetic resonance angiographic techniques and catheter angiography in evaluation of carotid stenosis. To compare the accuracy of ultrasound and two magnetic resonance (MR) angiographic techniques with catheter angiography in assessing atherosclerosis at the carotid bifurcation.Forty patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis were studied by Doppler ultrasound, time-of-flight MR angiography, contrast-enhanced MR angiography and conventional catheter angiography. The degree of stenosis found on ultrasound and MR angiography was compared with the results of catheter angiography. Four different assessment methods were conducted for the MR angiographic data. Kappa, sensitivity and specificity (with confidence intervals) values were calculated for the US and MR angiography results compared to catheter angiography.Catheter angiography showed 12 internal carotid artery occlusions (15%), 34 severe (44%), 12 moderate (15%) and 20 mild stenoses (26%), using NASCET criteria. Ultrasound showed 65% sensitivity and 95% specificity in detecting surgically amenable lesions, whilst the MR angiographic techniques had sensitivities varying from 82-100%, and specificities from 95-100%.A moderate kappa value was calculated for the US data, whilst all MR techniques were found to show very good agreement with catheter angiography.This data suggests that MR angiography is more accurate than Doppler ultrasound in defining surgical lesions and has comparable accuracy to catheter angiography. The use of contrast-enhanced MR angiography is useful in certain situations but is not essential in all cases.
