Smoking, but not lipids, lipoprotein(a) and antibodies against oxidised LDL, is correlated to the expansion of abdominal aortic aneurysms. to study the role of smoking, lipids, lipoprotein (a), and autoantibodies against oxidised low density lipoprotein (Ab-oxLDL) in the expansion of small abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). To study the role of Ab-oxLDL and lp(a) in the progression of lower limb atherosclerosis.one hundred and thirty-eight male patients with AAA were interviewed, examined, and their serum lipids and S-Ab-oxLDL determined. Of these, 117 were followed annually with ultrasound and underwent control scans and blood pressure measurements for a mean of 2.5 (range 1-5) years.initial AAA size, smoking and level of triglycerides were positively correlated to increased aneurysmal expansion, while beta-blocker medication was associated with decreased expansion. Besides initial AAA size, only smoking had persisting significance after adjustment of the other significant variables. Initial ankle brachial pressure index (ABI) and Lp(A) but not ab-oxLDL were significantly correlated to ABI change.smoking cessation may inhibit aneurysmal expansion. Lipids seem to play a minor role in the progression of AAA.
