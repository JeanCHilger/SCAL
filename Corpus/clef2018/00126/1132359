Doppler measurement of arterial pressure for assessing therapeutic measures after arterial occlusion (author's transl). Arterial pressure differences between arm and foot arteries can be easily measured by the Doppler method and in this way the gradient across an arterial occlusion of the lower limbs approximately quantified. An increase in gradient after induced ischemia is inversely proportional to its compensation. Pre- and postoperative measurements on 51 limbs demonstrated that functional results of arterial reconstruction can be thus assessed and their further course objectified.
