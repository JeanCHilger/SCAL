Role of gender upon basal and postprandial systemic and splanchnic haemodynamics in humans. Food intake, accompanied by systemic and splanchnic haemodynamic changes, has only been studied in males. The extent to which splanchnic postprandial hyperaemia shows gender differences is unknown.We tested 1) the splanchnic hyperaemic response to food in females and 2) whether postprandial haemodynamic changes show gender differences. Twenty-four healthy women (aged 20-35 years) and 20 healthy men (aged 21-34 years) participated in the study. A liquid test meal (Ensure plus, 1.5 kcal/ml) was perfused intraduodenally for 75 min through an enteral feeding tube at a rate of 3 ml/min after a 45-min basal period. Blood flow parameters were measured using Echo-Doppler technology.Basal diastolic arterial blood pressure was significantly (P < 0.05) lower in females (66+/-2 versus 72+/-2 mmHg), whereas heart rate was the same (58+/-2 b/min, ns). Postprandially, diastolic blood pressure fell, but reached significance only in males (-10+/-3 mmHg P < 0.05). Mean velocity in the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in females compared to males at baseline (47+/-3 versus 39+/-2 cm/s), whereas maximal postprandial changes were similar (64+/-6 versus 56+/-6 cm/s, ns). Volume flow in the portal vein (PV) at baseline was 656+/-29 and 716+/-35 ml/min females and males, respectively (ns between gender). Maximal postprandial changes amounted to 808+/-86 and 884+/-107 ml/min, respectively (ns).1) Perfusion of a liquid test meal induces significant increases in flow parameters in the SMA and PV in both genders. 2) These changes are partly paralleled by alterations in systemic haemodynamics. 3) Postprandial splanchnic flow parameters are qualitatively and quantitatively not different between genders.
