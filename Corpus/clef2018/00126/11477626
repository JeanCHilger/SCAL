Quantitative (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy of myoglobin de- and reoxygenation in skeletal muscle: reproducibility and effects of location and disease. 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) of deoxymyoglobin (DMb) provides a means to noninvasively monitor the oxygenation state of human skeletal muscle in work and disease. As shown in this work, it also offers the opportunity to measure the absolute tissue content of DMb, the basic oxygen consumption of resting muscle, and the reperfusion characteristics after release of a pressure cuff. The methodology to determine these tissue properties simultaneously at two positions along the calf is presented. The obtained values are in agreement with invasive determinations. The reproducibility of the (1)H-MRS measurements is established for healthy controls and patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). A location dependence in axial direction, as well as differences between controls and patients are demonstrated for all parameters. The reoxygenation time in particular is expected to provide a means to quantitatively monitor therapies aimed at improving muscular perfusion in these patients.
