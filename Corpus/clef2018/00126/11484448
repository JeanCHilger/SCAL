Intercostal percutaneous ultrasound guided decompressive gastrostomy (PUG)--a case report. Percutaneous gastrostomies (PG) are nowadays usually placed endoscopically (PEG). Due to stenoses in the pharynx or the esophagus or in case of a lack of diaphany, other methods for the placement of PG such as computed tomography (CT-) guided or ultrasound-guided PG (PUG) are performed. We present a case of a 63-year old male patient with a retroperitoneal liposarcoma and multivisceral resection who presented with the symptoms and signs of an ileus due to metastatic occlusion of the small bowel. The placement of a decompression-PEG was impossible due to interposition of colon between the stomach and the abdominal wall. After filling the stomach with water via a naso-gastral decompression tube, the stomach could be visualized at the left thoracic wall, since the spleen and the left kidney had been removed at prior surgery. A transcostal decompression-PUG was inserted. The intervention described is the first published ultrasound guided transcostal decompression gastrostomy and is an example for the growing significance of interventional ultrasound.
