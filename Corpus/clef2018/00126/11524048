Differential effects of cilostazol and pentoxifylline on vascular endothelial growth factor in patients with intermittent claudication. Cilostazol is a new phosphodiesterase inhibitor with anti-platelet and vasodilatory properties. Cilostazol and pentoxifylline are the only two drugs that have been approved for the treatment of patients with intermittent claudication. However, the mechanisms by which exercise tolerance is improved remain unclear. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent endothelial mitogen that results in angiogenesis when overexpressed in human subjects. To assess the potential role of VEGF in the improvement in exercise tolerance, we investigated plasma levels of VEGF in 50 patients with intermittent claudication who were allocated randomly to groups receiving cilostazol (n=17), pentoxifylline (n=17) or placebo (n=16). Patients given either cilostazol or pentoxifylline showed a significant improvements in maximal walking distance compared with the placebo group (34 m and 33 m respectively, compared with 5 m both P<0.05). Neither cilostazol nor pentoxifylline increased the ankle-brachial index after treatment. Circulating VEGF levels were increased (from 116+/-29 to 169+/-45 pg/ml
