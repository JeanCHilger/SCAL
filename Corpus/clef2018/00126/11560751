Integral role of interventional radiology in the development of a pediatric liver transplantation program. The aim of this study was to examine the role of interventional radiology (IR) in the pretransplant evaluation of potential living-related liver transplantation (LRLT) donors and in the post-transplant management of pediatric liver transplant recipients. Medical records and procedural reports were reviewed of 12 potential donors and five recipients for left lateral segment liver transplants. Procedures performed by the IR Division, clinical indications, and complications were tabulated. Retrospective calculation of radiation exposure to the skin and gonads of the donors and recipients were made. Three-dimensional ultrasound (3D US) was used in all 12 potential donors to screen for the donor with the most appropriately sized left lateral segment. The four optimal donor candidates underwent contrast angiography in order to measure the diameter and screen for variant arterial supply to the left lateral segment. Pretransplantation, one recipient underwent mesenteric angiography with indirect portography to confirm thrombosis of the portal vein and to prove patency of the splenomesenteric venous confluence. Three children underwent LRLT and two children received split livers from cadaveric donors. Thirty-two IR procedures were performed after transplantation (Tx) in the four transplant survivors (one child died following Tx). These IR procedures included: ultrasound-guided percutaneous liver biopsy to evaluate the pathologic cause of liver dysfunction (seven) placement of nasal jejunal feeding tubes (three) or a peripherally inserted central catheter (four) for nutritional and pharmacologic support
