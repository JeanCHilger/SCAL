Intracranial ossifications and microangiopathy at 8 Tesla MRI. Clinical evaluation and MR imaging of microangiopathy associated with hypertension is limited. We describe a case that illustrates sensitivity of MRI at 8 Tesla for imaging of microvasculature, iron, calcium deposits and silent white matter lesions (WML). A 60-year-old black hypertensive woman was evaluated for numbness in the face and extremities. MRI at 1.5 Tesla was unrevealing.MRI at 8 Tesla: Axial and sagittal Gradient Echo images were obtained with an 8T/80 cm human scanner and showed: 1) Large areas of signal voids due to ossifications and fat deposits within the falx. 2) Obstructed small vessels in the periventricular regions and distended cortical veins. 3) Numerous small WML, suggestive of mini-infarcts (<1 cm) and microhemorrhages. 4) Intracranial calcifications in the falx, tentorium, basal ganglia and chorioid plexus that were confirmed by CT scan. Atherosclerotic plaque in right carotid artery and reduced vasomotor reserve in middle cerebral arteries, documented by ultrasound, indicated large and small vessel disease.MRI at 8 Tesla improves visualization of microangiopathy, ossifications and iron deposits due to enhanced magnetic susceptibility at ultra high magnetic field.
