Cup-to-disc ratio, intraocular pressure, and primary open-angle glaucoma in retinal venous occlusion. To investigate the association of cup-to-disc ratio (CDR), intraocular pressure (IOP), and primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) with the site of retinal venous occlusion (RVO) and optic nerve head swelling (ONHS).Prospective observational case series.Four hundred fifty consecutive cases from a single tertiary referral center.Fundus photography of the retinopathy, 30 degrees stereo photography of the optic disc, and Goldmann applanation tonometry were the main parameters studied. The diagnosis of POAG was obtained from the referring ophthalmologist.The main outcome measures were the CDR, measured vertically through the center of the optic disc, and the site of RVO, identified as an arteriovenous (AV) crossing, optic cup, or optic nerve. Retinal venous occlusions occurring within the optic nerve were subdivided on the basis of the presence or absence of ONHS.There were poor correlations between CDR and IOP (r = 0.18 P = 0.000209) and CDR and age (r = 0.21Optic cup and optic nerve-sited RVO without ONHS are associated with raised IOP and may share a common management strategy aimed at controlling ocular pressure. Glaucomatous optic disc cupping, in contrast, seems to be important in the OC-sited RVO group only. Intraocular pressure, POAG, and glaucomatous optic disc cupping do not significantly seem to contribute to the development of RVO at an AV crossing or when the occlusion occurs within the optic nerve in association with ONHS.
