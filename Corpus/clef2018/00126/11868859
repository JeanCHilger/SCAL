Ankle brachial index as a predictor of generalized atherosclerosis. To assess ankle brachial index (ABI) as a screening method to target subclinical atherosclerosis in middle aged individuals.Total 160 patients over the age of 40 years were included in the study for a period of 16 months. Their ABI was determined either by colour Doppler method (30 patients) and/or sphygmomanometry (all 160 patients). A value of < 0.9 was taken as cutoff point for significant stenosis.Total 69 patients out of total of 160 had significantly low ABI value (43.12%) which shows that there is a very high incidence of low ABI in the community. Overall > 50% of the patients were largely asymptomatic and had presence of two or more risk factors. ABI < 0.9 was a good screening test to detect such individuals at an earlier stage (sub-clinical).A significantly low (< 0.9) ABI value can detect subclinical atherosclerotic vascular involvement and predict future occurrence of preventable major vascular event.
