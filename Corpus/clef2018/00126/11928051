The technique of laparoscopically assisted total gastrectomy with jejunal interposition for early gastric cancer. In recent years, laparoscopic gastrectomy has been applied to the treatment of gastric cancer in Japan. However, there are few reports of laparoscopic or laparoscopically assisted total gastrectomy in the treatment of gastric cancer because of the difficulty of the surgical technique. Laparoscopically assisted total gastrectomies with jejunal interpositions were performed on four patients with early gastric cancer located in the upper portion of the stomach.Four surgical ports were inserted into the abdomen. The stomach was lifted to the abdominal wall using newly developed retraction tubes. Gastric arteries were divided using ultrasonically activated coagulating shears and ligated with ligation forceps. Following these steps, a total gastrectomy reconstruction was performed by jejunal interposition through a small transverse laparotomy. An esophagojejunostomy and a jejunoduodenostomy were made with circular staplers.The mean operating time and blood loss were 246 min and 236 ml, respectively. The operations were performed without serious complications. All patients were pain free and ambulatory after the laparoscopically assisted total gastrectomy, and the mean postoperative hospital stay was 16 days.We successfully performed laparoscopically assisted total gastrectomies in a relatively short period of time. When patients are carefully selected, the laparoscopic procedure can be curative and minimally invasive as a treatment for early gastric cancer.
