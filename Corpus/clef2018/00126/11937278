High-flow priapism: a combined interventional approach with angiography and colour Doppler. Traumatic high-flow priapism caused by a pathologic influx from lacerated arteries to the cavernous bodies is usually treated by transcatheter arterial embolisation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a combined interventional approach with intraoperative perineal colour Doppler ultrasound (US) while performing the embolisation procedure. Our aim was to reduce radiation exposure and application of iodinised contrast media. To achieve an optimal position of the angiography catheter directly before or in the fistula, instead of several x-ray examinations with contrast media, a perineal colour Doppler US examination was performed while saline or US contrast media were injected through the catheter. The flow pattern allows the assessment of the occlusion of the fistula and the intact flow in the arteries that were not damaged. In four patients (unilateral fistula: 1, bilateral fistulas: 3) with traumatic high-flow priapism, this technique was performed combined with a conventional angiographic control of the embolisation. Seven embolisation sessions were performed. Only in one case, a dislocation of a microcoil required a second session. In all cases, the priapism disappeared immediately after the final session, leading to a restored erectile function. This combined approach may reduce the exposure to radiation and contrast media, especially in children, who often suffer from multiple fistulas and need more than one session. The procedure also prevents an occlusion of intact arteries that affects the penile perfusion and increases the risk of erectile dysfunction.
