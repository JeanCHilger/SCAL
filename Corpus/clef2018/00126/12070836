Doppler study of gluteal arteries. A useful tool for excluding gluteal arterial pathology snd an important adjunct to lower limb Doppler studies. 1) To determine the negative predictive value (VPN) of duplex scan in patients complaining of buttock or hip pain and thereby to distinguish vascular claudication from other musculoskeletal or neurological diseases. 2) To show its complementarity in doppler investigation of lower limb arteries.Prospective study by duplex scan and arteriography of 60 gluteal arteries in 30 consecutive patients referred to check up for lower limb arteriopathy or sexual impotence. Duplex scan was performed by posterior approach. Correlation between doppler ultrasound and arteriography was studied.The study of normal arteries was possible in all cases and only one normal gluteal artery could not be detected in a diabetic overweight patient. On 60 arteries, sensitivity of duplex was 100 percent, specificity 96 percent and VPN 100 percent. Significant obstructive lesions were always associated with pathological velocimetric waveform or were not detected.Buttock claudication can appear like a typical vascular claudication or mimic neurological or musculoskeletal diseases. It is very useful to rule out a vascular causality responsible for buttock or hip pain by simple, non-invasive and cheap exploration. A normal doppler ultrasound of gluteal arteries can rule out vascular disease responsible for buttock or hip pain thereby avoiding arteriography. The strategy of diagnostic or therapy can be modified by such additional information as shown in two case reports.
