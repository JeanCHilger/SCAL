Circulating adhesion molecules in patients with internal carotid artery stenosis. To study the association of plasma concentrations of soluble adhesion molecules (sICAM-1, sVCAM-1 and sE-selectin) with atheroslerotic lesions at the origin of the internal carotid artery (ICA). 179 subjects were investigated by color Doppler ultrasound of whom 133 had and 46 had no plaques at the ICA origin. Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that hypertension (p < 0.001), sICAM-1 concentrations (p < 0.01) and smoking (p < 0.05) were independently associated with the presence of ICA plaques. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that sICAM-1 concentrations in subjects with plaque were negatively associated with the degree of ICA stenosis (p < 0.01) and positively associated with previous cerebral ischemia (p < 0.01), coronary heart disease (p < 0.05) and peripheral artery disease (p < 0.05). In conclusion, elevated sICAM-1 concentrations are independently associated with atherosclerosis of the ICA origin and are predominantly increased in patients with low-grade lesions and with clinical manifestations of vascular disorders.
