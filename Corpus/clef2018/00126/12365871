Middle aortic syndrome diagnosed at 54 years of age--a case report. A 54-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of heart failure, upper-limb hypertension, and lower-limb claudication. A loud systolic bruit was audible along the middle lower back. An arteriogram confirmed long-segment stenosis from the lower thoracic to the upper abdominal aorta with normal aortic arch. The patient was diagnosed as having middle aortic syndrome. This case was atypical because most cases of this disease are seen in children and young adults. After administration of diuretics and ACE-I, the heart failure and hypertension were both improved. However, the lower limb claudication was aggravated because of decreased blood pressure of the lower limb. In this patient, percutaneous angioplasty or surgical treatment will be required to prevent the recurrence of heart failure and to improve long-term quality of life by relief from intermittent claudication.
