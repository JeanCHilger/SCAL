The capillary blood flow in ischaemic type central retinal vein occlusion: the effect of laser photocoagulation. To determine the effect of photocoagulation on retinal blood flow (RBF) in eyes with ischaemic type central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO).Retinal blood flow was measured in 12 eyes with CRVO, 12 fellow eyes and 12 eyes of 12 age-matched healthy subjects using the Heidelberg retinal flowmeter (HRF). Microvascular blood flow values (volume, flow, velocity) were recorded from the upper temporal retina and macula. Eyes were re-examined 1 month after photocoagulation. We investigated whether there was a difference in RBF measurements before and after photocoagulation treatment.In eyes with CRVO, mean RBF values (volume, flow and velocity) obtained from the upper temporal retina increased significantly after treatment (paired t-test, p < 0.05). In contrast, mean RBF values from the macula were unaffected by photocoagulation (paired t-test, p > 0.05). Retinal blood flow values from the upper temporal retina obtained from control subjects were significantly higher than the values in eyes with CRVO before and after photocoagulation (unpaired t-test, p < 0.05), but there was no significant difference between control subjects and CRVO patients in RBF values from the macula (unpaired t-test, p > 0.05). Mean RBF values were significantly higher in CRVO patients' fellow-eyes before photocoagulation in the eyes with CRVO (paired t-test, p < 0.05) but were lower than in age-matched healthy control eyes (unpaired t-test, p < 0.05). Macular blood flow did not differ between the eyes with CRVO and fellow eyes (paired t-test, p > 0.05).Laser photocoagulation increased retinal blood flow in eyes with CRVO, but RBF did not reach normal values. Photocoagulation was found to have no effect on RBF in the macular area.
