Impact of multiple coronary risk factors on the intima-media thickness of different segments of carotid artery in healthy young adults (The Bogalusa Heart Study). Although risk factors for coronary artery disease are also associated with increased carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) as measured by B-mode ultrasonography in middle-aged and older persons, information on the impact of multiple risk factors on the IMT of different segments of the carotid artery in young adults is limited. This relation was examined in a sample of 518 black and white subjects (mean age 32 years 71% white, 39% male) enrolled in the Bogalusa Heart Study. IMT was thicker and more skewed in the bulb compared with other carotid segments. Race differences (blacks more than whites) were noted for the common carotid (p <0.001) and carotid bulb (bifurcation) IMT (women only, p <0.001). Men had a greater IMT in the common carotid (p <0.05), internal carotid (p <0.05), and carotid bulb (whites only, p <0.001). In a multivariate analysis, systolic blood pressure, race, age, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol weree entered into a model in that order and accounted for the 16.7% variance in the common carotid IMT
