Sonographic detection of a malpositioned feeding tube causing esophageal perforation in a neonate. We report a case of esophageal perforation caused by a malpositioned feeding tube in a neonate of extremely low birth weight, 632 g. The infant had respiratory distress, which increased rapidly when he was 6 days old. Radiography revealed right-sided hydrothorax that had not been evident a day earlier but no sign of a perforated esophagus. We performed sonography, which revealed fluid in the right pleural cavity and extra-esophageal placement of the feeding tube. Analysis of a fluid specimen obtained on thoracocentesis indicated that the fluid was feeding formula. The feeding tube's misplacement was confirmed sonographically by injecting a small amount of sterile distilled water into the tube and visualizing its entry into the pleural cavity. The feeding tube was removed, and antimicrobial agents were administered. When the infant was 15 days old, feeding resumed through another tube, the placement of which was verified radiographically. The infant was discharged when he was 118 days old with no severe complications, although he had mild chronic lung disease. Because radiography did not reveal the tube's misplacement in this case, we believe that the use of sonography can contribute to an early diagnosis of esophageal perforation in such cases.
