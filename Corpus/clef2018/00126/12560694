Ankle-arm index versus angiography for the preassessment of the fibula free flap. Peripheral arterial occlusive disease or congenital anomalies of the major crural arteries may limit the use of the fibula free flap and should be detected preoperatively. Conventional selective angiography is the definitive standard imaging method for making this diagnosis, but it has drawbacks. A safer, cheaper, more accurate, and noninvasive alternative is desirable. The authors sought to test the hypothesis that the ankle-arm index of each of the three crural arteries, combined with pencil Doppler examination of the peroneal skin perforators, would provide adequate information to restrict the use of angiography to cases in which the outcomes of either or both of these options are insufficient. The ankle-arm index data of each of the three crural arteries, as well as pencil Doppler examination of the peroneal skin perforators of both legs of nine prospectively included patients and the nonoperated legs of 13 retrospectively included patients, were compared statistically in four different ways with the preoperative angiographic findings. A combined ankle-arm index and pencil Doppler examination is not accurate enough to detect legs or arteries with subclinical peripheral arterial occlusive disease or vascular variation and, hence, is not a sufficient basis on which to develop the surgical plan for a fibula free flap.
