Statin use and leg functioning in patients with and without lower-extremity peripheral arterial disease. We determined whether statin use (versus nonuse) is associated with superior lower-extremity functioning independently of cholesterol levels and other confounders in patients with and without peripheral arterial disease.Participants included 392 men and women with an ankle brachial index (ABI) <0.90 and 249 with ABI 0.90 to 1.50. Functional outcomes included 6-minute walk distance and 4-meter walking velocity. A summary performance score combined performance in walking speed, standing balance, and time for 5 repeated chair rises into an ordinal score ranging from 0 to 12 (12=best). Adjusting for age, sex, ABI, comorbidities, education level, medical insurance status, cholesterol, and other confounders, participants taking statins had better 6-minute walk performance (1276 versus 1218 feet, P=0.045), faster walking velocity (0.93 versus 0.89 m/s, P=0.006), and a higher summary performance score (10.2 versus 9.4, P<0.001) than participants not taking statins. Positive associations were attenuated slightly after additional adjustment for C-reactive protein level but remained statistically significant for walking velocity and the summary performance score. We did not find significant associations between lower-extremity functioning and aspirin, ACE inhibitors, vasodilators, or beta-blockers.Statin use is associated with superior leg functioning compared with no statin use, independent of cholesterol levels and other potential confounders. These data suggest that non-cholesterol-lowering properties of statins may favorably influence functioning in persons with and without peripheral arterial disease.
