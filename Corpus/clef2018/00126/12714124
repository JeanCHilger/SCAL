Effects of simvastatin on walking performance and symptoms of intermittent claudication in hypercholesterolemic patients with peripheral vascular disease. To analyze the effects of short-term therapy with simvastatin on walking performance in hypercholesterolemic patients with peripheral vascular disease.Eighty-six patients with peripheral arterial disease (Fontaine stage II), intermittent claudication, and total cholesterol levels >220 mg/dL were enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Forty-three patients were assigned to simvastatin (40 mg/d) the remaining 43 patients were assigned to placebo treatment. All patients underwent an exercise test and clinical examination, and completed a self-assessment questionnaire at 0, 3, and 6 months. Pain-free and total walking distance, resting and postexercise ankle-brachial indexes, and questionnaire scores were determined at each follow-up.At 6 months, the mean pain-free walking distance had increased 90 meters (95% confidence interval [CI]: 64 to 116 meters P <0.005) more in the simvastatin group than in the placebo group. Similar results were seen for the total walking distance (mean between-group difference in the change, 126 metersHigh-dose short-term therapy with simvastatin may improve walking performance, ankle-brachial pressure indexes, and symptoms of claudication in hypercholesterolemic patients with peripheral vascular disease.
