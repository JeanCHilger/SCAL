Reninoma: a rare but curable cause of high blood pressure, a case report. We report a case of a renin secreting tumor, which is a very rare cause of secondary high blood pressure. A 22-year-old woman was hospitalised for exploration of high blood pressure (160/110 mmHg) with severe hypokaliemia (2,7 mmol/l) and secondary hyperaldosteronism. Physical examination was normal except the high blood pressure. Bioassays show increased kaliuresis (66 mmol/24h), plasma renin (89 pg/ml in clinostastism--108 pg/ml in orthostatism), pro-renin (1207 pg/ml in clinostastism--1412 pg/ml in orthostatism) and aldosterone (210 pg/ml in clinostastism--566 pg/ml in orthostatism). The rest of the endocrine tests were normal (cortisol and ACTH at 8:00 am, urinary free cortisol, overnight 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test). Doppler ultrasound method, performed by an experienced radiologist, did not show renal artery stenosis. Abdominal computerized tomography showed a nodular formation at the upper pole of the right kidney, isodense to renal medullary. The size tumor was 15 mm. The renal vein sampling shows high values of renin on both sides whereas, for the pro-renin, the values were higher on the tumor side. In spite of treatment with CEI (Converting Enzyme Inhibitors) and calcium antagonists, the blood pressure was not controlled. Hypokaliemia persisted (3 mmol/l) in spite of high daily potassium intake (64 mmol/l of potassium chloride). After tumor resection, reninoma was diagnosed by the pathology examination and blood pressure, plasma rennin, plasma aldosterone level returned to normal.
