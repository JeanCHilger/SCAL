Fatal hypertensive encephalopathy in a child with association of multicystic kidney and renal artery stenosis. At the age of 5 years, a boy with known multicystic dysplastic kidney disease showed signs of arterial hypertension with progress to fatal hypertensive encephalopathy. Arterial hypertension was refractory to antihypertensive therapy and the child lost consciousness. Computed tomography of the brain revealed multiple cerebral infarctions. Doppler ultrasound showed an elevation of blood flow in the main artery of the functioning kidney consistent with stenosis as a cause of hypertension.Arterial hypertension is a known complication of kidney disease. Multicystic dysplastic kidney and renal artery stenosis is a potentially fatal association. Careful evaluation and monitoring, with special emphasis on blood pressure, should be performed in children with multicystic dysplastic kidney disease.
