Color flow Doppler ultrasonography: comparison with peripheral arteriography for the investigation of peripheral vascular disease. Using arteriography as the gold standard, Color flow Doppler ultrasonography was evaluated with regard to its ability to detect peripheral vascular occlusive disease and hemodynamically significant stenosis in patients having peripheral arteriography. One hundred legs in 51 patients were compared at seven arterial segments for disease. Color flow Doppler ultrasonography correctly detected 84 occluded segments, and demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity for patency vs occlusive disease of 95% and 99%, respectively. One hundred and thirty hemodynamically significant lesions (occlusions plus significant stenosis) were correctly identified with color flow Doppler ultrasonography, with a sensitivity and specificity of 92% and 97%, respectively. Color flow Doppler ultrasonography is a safe, inexpensive, and noninvasive method of accurately documenting significant peripheral arterial disease and offers a new first-line investigation for patients presenting with symptoms of peripheral arterial insufficiency.
