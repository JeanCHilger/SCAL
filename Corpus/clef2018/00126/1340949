Acute renal insufficiency secondary to the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in 2 patients without renal artery stenosis. Two female patients who developed acute renal failure secondary to the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for hypertension are presented. None had renal artery stenosis on angiography or duplex doppler ultrasound examination. A 66 year old patient with a single functioning kidney recovered basal renal function the other patient, aged 77 years, remained with a permanent severe renal damage. Risk factors were advanced age, mild chronic renal failure due to nephrosclerosis and diuretic use. We conclude that acute renal failure related to ACE inhibitors may be severe and can occur even in patients without renal artery stenosis. Diuretics, associated to ACE inhibitors, should be prescribed with caution, specially in older hypertensive patients with pre-existing chronic renal failure. Diabetic patients are at special risk due to the high incidence of small vessel disease in them.
