Endogenous nitric oxide protects against platelet aggregation and cyclic flow variations in stenosed and endothelium-injured arteries. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that endogenously produced nitric oxide protects against platelet aggregation and cyclic flow variations in stenosed and endothelium-injured arteries of mongrel dogs.NG-Monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), an inhibitor of nitric oxide formation, was administered at 5 mg/kg to 15 dogs after the left anterior descending coronary artery was mechanically injured and narrowed by external constrictors and to nine dogs before endothelial injury of the femoral artery and after injury and moderate arterial constriction. Treatment with L-NMMA resulted in cyclic flow variations (as detected by external Doppler flow probes) in the left anterior descending artery of seven of 15 dogs and in the femoral artery of four of nine dogs after endothelial injury. L-Arginine, the precursor for nitric oxide synthesis, was administered at 60 mg/kg and abolished cyclic flow variations in each of the 11 dogs. D-Arginine did not change the L-NMMA-induced cyclic flow variations. Saline infusion did not induce or change cyclic flow variations in any of the animals. Acetylcholine (1, 10, and 100 micrograms/min n = 9) was administered in the femoral artery of nine additional dogs before and after endothelial injury in moderately stenosed femoral arteries. Acetylcholine did not induce cyclic flow variations in any animalPromotion of nitric oxide production decreases platelet aggregation and may eliminate cyclic flow variations, whereas a reduction in nitric oxide formation enhances platelet aggregation and may induce cyclic flow variations. Acetylcholine causes vasoconstriction at the femoral arterial site of endothelial injury and may increase the severity of cyclic flow variations.
