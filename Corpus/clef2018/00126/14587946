Meningitis due to Enterobacter aerogenes subsequent to resection of acoustic neuroma and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement: a rare nosocomial event. We present a case of meningitis after percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement subsequent to acoustic neuroma resection and cranioplasty. Four days following PEG tube placement, the patient developed Enterobacter aerogenes meningitis, requiring explantation of infected cranioplasty material. His condition subsequently improved. Etiology and future intervention strategies are discussed.
