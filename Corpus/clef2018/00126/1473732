Prevalence of peripheral arterial disease and related risk factors in elderly institutionalized subjects. Blood pressure was measured at the posterior tibial artery by Doppler ultrasonography in 124 elderly subjects (37 men and 87 women) living in two retirement homes in Naples (Italy). Ankle-to-arm systolic pressure ratios below 0.97 and 0.90 was considered as a probable and definite pathological sign of peripheral arterial disease, respectively. Half of the subjects (48% of men and 51% of women) gave a value below 0.97, while a third (35% of men and 33% of women) had a value below 0.90. By multiple regression analysis, mean blood pressure, plasma cholesterol levels and cigarette smoking were all negatively correlated with ankle systolic pressure values with a progressively lower significance. Most of the patients with pathological Doppler examination were asymptomatic at a questionnaire for intermittent claudication.
