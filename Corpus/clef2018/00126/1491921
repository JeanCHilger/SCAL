Iatrogenic perforation of the lamina cribrosa by nasogastric tube in an infant. A case of iatrogenic perforation of the lamina cribrosa, followed by intracranial placement of a nasogastric tube in a preterm neonate is described. By routine ultrasound examination of the brain an echogenic structure was seen, which was radiographically diagnosed as a nasogastric tube. The tube was manually removed under antibiotic prophylaxis. No complications were observed. The false route disappeared and long-term follow-up showed no neurological side effects.
