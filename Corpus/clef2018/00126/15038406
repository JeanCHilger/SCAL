Hyperbaric oxygenation combined with streptokinase for treatment of arterial thromboembolism of the lower leg. Thromboembolic occlusion of peripheral arteries is a common problem in patients referred to vascular surgery departments. Standard treatments include catheter aspiration techniques, use of fibrinolytic agents and surgical thrombendarterectomy. Recent reports have described the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in patients with limb ischemia, yet their main focus has been on patients with chronic disorders. We present the case of a 74-year-old woman with atrial fibrillation and acute thromboembolic occlusion of the posterior tibial artery. The patient presented with severe pain in the right calf, unresponsive to non-opioid parenteral analgesia and accompanied by coldness, numbness and partial motor palsy of the right foot. After 60 minutes of oxygenation in a hyperbaric chamber with a pressure of 2.2 bar, the pain receded, although without signs of restored blood flow in the occluded artery. After fibrinolytic therapy with streptokinase, patency of the posterior tibial artery was verified by return of palpable pulsations and color Doppler ultrasonography. By combining hyperbaric oxygenation and streptokinase in the treatment of lower-leg arterial thromboembolism we achieved regression of ischemic pain, prolongation of the survival time of tissues compromised by ischemia and resolved the cause of the ischemia. We believe the use of this therapeutic strategy in selected cases of peripheral arterial thromboembolism is justified.
