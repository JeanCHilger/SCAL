Is the Stresst'er a reliable stress test to detect mild to moderate peripheral arterial disease? A stress test is required in patients with a resting ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) of >0.9 in whom peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is suspected.To see if the Stresst'er Ergometer could mimic a standard 1 min treadmill exercise test and successfully diagnose the presence of significant PAD.Legs with a resting ABPI >0.9, a positive exercise test and PAD confirmed on Duplex ultrasound, underwent various protocols on the Stresst'er Ergometer. The results were compared to control legs with no PAD (normal stress test).By making various adjustments to the rate and duration of the exercise, the resistance provided by the Stresst'er to the exercise and the timing of the post exercise ABPI measurement it was possible to accurately diagnose significant PAD.Using an appropriate protocol it is possible to use the Stresst'er Ergometer to assist in the diagnosis of significant PAD. Being a portable, space saving device, the Stresst'er offers the opportunity of diagnosis outside the vascular laboratory. This would facilitate medical therapy to at risk patients.
