Acoustic study of swallowing behaviour in premature infants during tube-bottle feeding and bottle feeding period. The premature infant has limited ability to integrate the swallowing-breathing cycle during feeding. The aim of this study was to assess the pattern of swallowing between the period of tube-bottle (TBF) and bottle (BF) feeding by means of cervical auscultation in premature infants. Twenty-three premature infants were enrolled (mean gestational age 34.7 +/- 1.7 weeks). Audiosignal recordings were made during TBF and BF with a small microphone set in front of the cricoid cartilage. The following parameters were calculated for 2 min and reported at 1 min: the percentage of time involved in swallowing (ST), the numbers of swallows (SN) and swallowing bursts (SB) and swallowing groups (SG). Individual histograms were established to show the individual pattern of swallowing behaviour and the distribution of groups, bursts and swallows over 2 min. Mean (STm), (SNm), (SBm), (SGm) values were calculated (+/- S.D.). Statistical analysis was used to compare the means and to establish correlations between parameters and curves. (STm), (SNm) and (SBm) increased significantly during BF compared with TBF for all premature infants and during follow-up. The histograms showed that in BF the groups were high in bursts. These findings and the histograms for each infant will allow determination of transition to bottle feeding without risk corresponding to the stage of maturation of swallowing function.
