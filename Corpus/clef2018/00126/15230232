Prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysm and peripheral arterial diseases in ambulatory patients with coronary disease. Presence of peripheral arterial disease in patients with coronary artery disease is associated with worse outcome. The aim of this epidemiological study was to evaluate the prevalence of different manifestation of atherothrombosis and its risk factors in the group of 2969 ambulatory patients with coronary artery disease. Mean age of investigated group was 61.2 +/- 10.5 years and 64% patients were male. Abdominal aortic aneurysm was diagnosed in 1.2% of patients, intermittent claudication in 13%, carotid stenosis in 5%. History of stroke was given in 4.4% cases and history of TIA in 7%. Only in 8% of patients with intermittent claudication ankle-brachial index was assessed. We conclude that among patients with coronary artery disease other arteries atherothrombotic involvement is diagnosed in our country infrequently and efforts to recognize other symptoms of atherothrombosis should be encouraged.
