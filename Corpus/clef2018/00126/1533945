Peripheral directional atherectomy: 4-year experience. Directional atherectomy alone or with supplemental percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was used to treat peripheral vascular lesions in 77 patients (85 procedures). Lesions involved 17 iliac arteries, 45 infrainguinal arteries, and 23 laser extremity vein bypass grafts. Technical success, defined as reduction of stenosis diameter to 30% or less of the normal vessel diameter, was achieved in 78 of 85 (92%) cases. The complication rate was 21% (18 of 85 procedures). Most complications were minor and were related to puncture sites. Patients underwent noninvasive follow-up studies, including measurement of ankle-brachial index and segmental pressures, plethysmography, and clinical examination. The mean follow-up period was 13.5 months. The probability of 1-, 2-, and 3-year patency for lesions treated with atherectomy alone was 92%, 84%, and 84%, respectively. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed no difference in 2- to 3-year patency rate on the basis of lesion location or presence of calcification, eccentricity, or ulceration. Diabetic patients, however, had a higher restenosis rate than did patients who were not diabetic (P less than .03).
