Vascular color Doppler ultrasound for assessing renovascular hypertension: accuracy of the direct technique for assessing the renal arteries. To assess the accuracy of vascular color Doppler ultrasound as compared with digital subtraction arteriography for identifying hemodynamically significant renal artery stenoses.One hundred and thirty-seven renal arteries from 69 adult patients suspected of having renovascular arterial hypertension were prospectively studied with ultrasound. The results obtained were compared in a double-blind manner with those obtained on digital subtraction arteriography, and the following parameters were calculated according to previously defined criteria: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and overall accuracy.The inconclusive results (7 arteries) were excluded. The comparison of the 2 methods in regard to the 130 remaining arteries showed concordant results for 116 (89.2%) arteries and discordant results for 14 (10.8%) arteries. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and overall accuracy of vascular color Doppler ultrasound were, respectively, 95.33%, 88.14%, 89.86%, 94.55%, and 91.94%.A good correlation between the 2 examinations was observed in the evaluation of the hemodynamically significant renal artery stenoses, making vascular color Doppler ultrasound a noninvasive method useful for selecting patients with suspected renovascular hypertension.
