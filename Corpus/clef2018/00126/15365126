CagA-positive Helicobacter pylori strains may influence the natural history of atherosclerotic stroke. To test the hypothesis that infection with virulent cytotoxin-associated gene-A (CagA)-bearing Helicobacter pylori strains influences the atherosclerotic process and the clinical course in atherosclerotic stroke patients.ELISA was used to assess the seroprevalence of infection by H. pylori and CagA-positive strains in 185 patients. Intima-media thickness (IMT) was determined by Doppler ultrasound. Baseline, 1-week, and 1-month NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores were used to evaluate the short-term clinical course.H. pylori infection was found in 79% of patients 58% of these tested positive for CagA. IMT was higher among CagA-positive patients than among CagA-negative ones (1.13 +/- 0.26 mm vs 0.97 +/- 0.15 mmInfection with cytotoxin-associated gene-A-positive Helicobacter pylori strains in atherosclerotic stroke patients is associated with greater intima-media thickness and poorer short-term outcome compared with cytotoxin-associated gene-A-negative patients.
