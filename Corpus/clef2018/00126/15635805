Chronic mesenteric ischemia. Chronic mesenteric ischemia often called intestinal angina too, is the clinical syndrome that originates as a result of chronic obstruction of the splanchnic arteries. Intestinal angina is defined by the clinical triad of postprandial abdominal pain, sitophobia (fear of eating) and chronic weight loss. Postprandial abdominal pain is analogous to angina pectoris and calf claudication, two more common manifestations of episodic tissue hypoxia. The authors present the case-history of a 50-year-old woman with intestinal angina due to obliteration of the all three main splanchnic arteries. The authors describe the course of the disease and point out new diagnostic approaches in the diagnosis of chronic mesenteric ischemia (Doppler ultrasound of the splanchnic arteries, helical CT angiography of the splanchnic vasculature). In the discussion they point out the possible atypical clinical manifestation of chronic mesenteric ischemia and existence of gastric ulceration and chronic ischemic gastritis caused by chronic mesenteric ischemia.
