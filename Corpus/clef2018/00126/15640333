Respiratory muscle dysfunction in idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) is a pulmonary vasculopathy of unknown aetiology. Dyspnoea, peripheral airway obstruction and inefficient ventilation are common in IPAH. Data on respiratory muscle function are lacking. This prospective single-centre study included 26 female and 11 male patients with IPAH in World Health Organization functional classes II-IV. Mean+/-SD pulmonary artery pressure was 48.6+/-16.9 in females and 53.1+/-22.9 mmHg in males cardiac output was 3.7+/-1.3 and 4.2+/-1.7 L x min(-1). Maximal inspiratory pressure (PI,max) was lower in the female patients than in 20 controls (5.3+/-2.0 versus 8.2+/-2.0 kPa). In the male patients, PI,max was lower than in 25 controls (6.8+/-2.2 versus 10.5+/-3.7 kPa). Maximal expiratory pressure (PE,max) was lower in the female patients than in controls (6.2+/-2.6 versus 9.5+/-2.1 kPa), and in male patients as compared to controls (7.1+/-1.6 versus 10.3+/-3.9 kPa). There was no correlation between PI,max or PE,max and parameters of pulmonary haemodynamics or exercise testing. The ratio of mouth occlusion pressure within the first 0.1 s of inspiration and PI,max was higher in IPAH than in controls (females 0.067+/-0.066 versus 0.021+/-0.008
