Budd-Chiari syndrome: in evolution. Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) is a rare but potentially life-threatening disorder caused by hepatic venous obstruction, distinct from cardiac causes of hepatic congestion or sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (formerly known as veno-occlusive disease). BCS may be classified as primary or secondary, depending on the underlying process. Most cases of primary BCS are due to an underlying hypercoagulable disorder. A high index of suspicion is required to make the diagnosis. In most case series, chronic, indolent cases of BCS are more common than acute presentations. Doppler ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and direct venography are useful in confirming the diagnosis. Systemic anticoagulation should be started expeditiously, as long as there are no contraindications. The use of systemic thrombolysis remains controversial. However, thrombolysis may prove effective when it is administered locally following hepatic venoplasty with or without stenting. Guidelines for the management of more complex cases and of patients who fail medical management are currently in evolution. Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) is potentially life-threatening, depending on the extent and rapidity of hepatic venous obstruction. A high index of suspicion is required to clinch the diagnosis, since BCS may be quite indolent or even asymptomatic. Doppler ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is usually definitive. Systemic anticoagulation should be offered to all patients, unless contraindicated. The role of thrombolysis in BCS remains controversial, and thus it should be reserved for cases undergoing hepatic decompression via percutaneous angioplasty. Guidelines for the management of cases who fail standard medical management are currently in evolution.
