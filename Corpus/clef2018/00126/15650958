Duodenal ileus due to an intramural duodenal haematoma. Conservative therapy using a multiple lumen intestinal probe. A 68-year-old woman was admitted with upper abdominal symptoms, epigastric fullness and nausea, eight days after initiation of heparin anticoagulation for deep-vein thrombosis. There were no other clinical abnormalities.Abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography showed an intramural duodenal haematoma. Endoscopy revealed a stenosing lesion in the duodenum.Instead of conventional parenteral nutrition, a triple-lumen feeding tube was placed, one lumen in the jejunum for feeding, the other for gastric decompression. Six months later the symptoms had completely disappeared and ultrasound, endoscopy and computed tomography no longer detected any lesion.Intrajejunal feeding and gastric decompression via a multi-lumen tube provided effective conservative treatment of duodenal ileus together with gastric decompression.
