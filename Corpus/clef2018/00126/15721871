The effects of PPAR-gamma ligand pioglitazone on platelet aggregation and arterial thrombus formation. It has been suggested that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma ligands reduce the development of atherosclerosis and myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury both of these phenomena are associated with platelet activation. We postulated that PPAR-gamma activation would inhibit platelet activation and intra-arterial thrombus formation.Sprague-Dawley rats were fed chow mixed with pioglitazone (1 or 10 mg/kg/day) for 7 to 10 days. A filter soaked in 30% FeCl(3) was applied around the abdominal aorta to study the patterns of arterial thrombogenesis. The aortic blood flow was continuously monitored using an ultrasonic Doppler flow probe. ADP and arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation and the expression of constitutive nitric oxide synthase (cNOS) and thrombomodulin in aorta were measured. Pioglitazone feeding delayed the time to occlusive thrombus formation by 40% (P<0.01 vs. control, n=9) without affecting the weight of the thrombus. ADP- as well as arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation was also inhibited by pioglitazone feeding (P<0.01 vs. control, n=9). Pioglitazone feeding also upregulated the aortic expression of cNOS and thrombomodulin both are considered important factors in platelet aggregation and thrombus formation in vivo. The effect of a high dose (10 mg/kg/day) of pioglitazone was not more potent than that of a low dose (1 mg/kg/day).These results indicate that pioglitazone administration decreases platelet aggregation and delays intra-arterial thrombus formation in rats, at least partially, by an increase in the expression of cNOS and thrombomodulin.
