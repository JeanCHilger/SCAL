A randomized trial assessing the value of ultrasound-guided puncture of the femoral artery for interventional investigations. Using a prospectively collected database of patients undergoing diagnostic or therapeutic angiography via transfemoral access, we sought to determine those patients who may benefit from ultrasound-guided puncture of the femoral artery. One-hundred-twelve patients with normal anticoagulation parameters were randomized in two groups. Fifty-six patients received ultrasound-guided puncture of the femoral artery, 56 patients underwent traditional palpation-guided vessel cannulation. Parameters assessed included procedure-time, number of attempts for successful puncture, intensity of the arterial pulse, previous ipsilateral punctures, history and risk factors of arteriosclerosis and leg circumference at the site of puncture. The data was analyzed by using outcome measures according to evidence-based medicine criteria. Only in patients with weak arterial pulse and thoses with a leg circumference of 60 cm or greater ultrasound guidance significantly decreased the number of attempts needed as well as the time for successful arterial puncture. In both patient subgroups, the number needed to treat (NNT) was 2, the absolute benefit increase (ABI) was 50 and 57%, respectively. In contrast, time for vessel cannulation was increased in patients with strong arterial pulse using ultrasound guidance. No significant differences were found with respect to diminished complications neither comparing both patient groups nor comparing risk subgroups. In conclusion ultrasound guidance for femoral artery access is recommended only in patients with a weak or absent arterial pulse and obese patients.
