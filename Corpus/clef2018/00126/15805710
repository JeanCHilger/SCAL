Chest pain and ST segment depression caused by expansion of gastric tube used for esophageal reconstruction. We describe a 76-year-old man in whom a gastric tube was used for esophageal reconstruction via the anterior mediastinum after esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. Stenosis of the tube resulted in fluid accumulation, which directly compressed the heart and caused angina-like chest pain associated with ST-segment depression in lead V(2-3) on the electrocardiogram (ECG). Coronary angiography revealed no stenosis. Drainage of the fluid in the gastric tube resulted in immediate relief of symptoms and normalization of ECG. Angina-like chest pain associated with ST segment changes were caused by expansion of the gastric tube and compression of the heart.
