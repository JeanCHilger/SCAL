Intermittent claudication: functional capacity and quality of life after exercise training or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty--systematic review. To systematically review published data about the short- and long-term effects of exercise training and angioplasty on functional capacity and quality of life of patients with intermittent claudication.Articles published between January 1980 and February 2003 were included if patients had intermittent claudication treated with exercise training or angioplasty and if both functional capacity and quality-of-life scores from Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form health survey were reported for at least 3 months of follow-up. Data were pooled by using a random effects model and weighted means. Pooled results were compared between the treatment groups by using the chi2 test and the Student t test (alpha = .05, two sided).In the analyses, five studies (202 patients) were included in the exercise group, and three studies (470 patients), in the angioplasty group. At 3 months of follow-up, the ankle-brachial index was significantly improved in the angioplasty group (mean change, 0.18 P < .01) but not in the exercise group (mean change, 0.01Improvement in quality of life was demonstrated after both exercise training and angioplasty, whereas functional capacity showed significant improvement after angioplasty. The ankle-brachial index significantly differed between the two treatment groups at 3 and 6 months, whereas the quality-of-life scores did not.
