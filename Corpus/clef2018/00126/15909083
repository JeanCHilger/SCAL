Accelerated atherosclerosis in rheumatic systemic diseases as an example of systemic lupus erythematosus--what is the consequence?. Large increases in mortality related to premature atherosclerosis with coronary artery disease and stroke have been reported during the last few years in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Studies found relative risks of 5 to 7 for myocardial infarction in SLE patients. The traditional risk factors fail to fully account for accelerated atherosclerosis in SLE and APS, in addition prolonged glucocorticoid therapy and long duration of SLE seem to be of importance. The disease SLE per se is an independent risk factor. The current pathogenic hypothesis for atherosclerosis involves an inflammatory response, autoantibodies, immune complexes (containing antibodies to phospholipids, to oxidized LDLs, and to endothelial cells), CD40/CD40 ligand interactions, and bacterial or viral infections responsible for an immune response. The determination of classic and new risk factors, together with specific autoantibody titers and the use of Doppler carotid ultrasound, are useful methods to detect early atherosclerosis. Therapeutic strategies, including early risk factor intervention and effective control of inflammation, are essential to reduce morbidity and mortality and should be incorporated into the management of connective tissue disease with the goal of protecting patients against atherosclerosis.
