Transesophageal echocardiography in comparison with magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of pulmonary vein stenosis after radiofrequency ablation therapy. Doppler-derived flow velocity measured by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) may overestimate pulmonary vein stenosis. We hypothesized that combining peak velocity with a stenotic flow pattern improves diagnosis compared with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).TEE and MRI were performed in 44 patients 19 +/- 11 months after radiofrequency catheter ablation. Pulmonary vein stenosis was defined by a peak velocity of 110 cm/s or more plus a stenotic flow pattern (turbulence and reduced flow variation) on TEE and a lumen reduction of more than 50% on MRI.In all, 175 pulmonary veins were studied. MRI showed 7 cases of pulmonary vein stenosis that were correctly identified by TEE. In addition, TEE criteria for pulmonary vein stenosis were met in 4 pulmonary veins that did not show obstruction on MRI. In all, 5 pulmonary veins with normal appearance on MRI had peak velocity of 110 cm/s or more with normal flow pattern.TEE Doppler measurements can be reliably used to detect or exclude significant pulmonary vein stenosis if the diagnosis is restricted to a combination of elevated peak velocity (> or = 110 cm/s) with turbulence and little flow variation.
