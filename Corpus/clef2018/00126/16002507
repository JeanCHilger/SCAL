Endovascular model of rabbit hindlimb ischemia: a platform to evaluate therapeutic angiogenesis. Current animal hindlimb ischemia models involve surgical ligation of the femoral artery and delivery of therapeutic angiogenic agents into the adductor compartment. The authors hypothesize that an endovascular model of hindlimb ischemia would be a more appropriate platform, closely resembling atherosclerosis by occluding the vessel from within, causing less inflammation, wound healing and subsequent collateralization.The left superficial femoral artery in 17 rabbits was occluded by endovascular coil embolization (n=9) or surgical ligation (n=8). Animals (n=3 in each group) were sacrificed on day 3 to determine the arteriolar luminal area, number of arterioles, microsphere determined perfusion, and degree of inflammation. On day 28, the remaining animals underwent calf blood pressure measurements and angiography to determine the number of collaterals and diameter of vessels supplying the hindlimb.Immediate postprocedure (day 0) and presacrifice (day 3 or 28) occlusion rates were 89% (eight of nine rabbits) and 100% for the endovascular model 100% and 100% for the surgical model, respectively. Hindlimb paralysis and muscle atrophy was found in one surgical animal. On day 3, there was an increase in hindlimb perfusion (surgery, 0.04+/-0.01The endovascular model was efficacious in providing occlusion of the superficial femoral artery, and induced less of an arteriogenic response compared with the surgical model. The authors believe that this endovascular model is a superior platform for studying therapeutic angiogenic agents.
