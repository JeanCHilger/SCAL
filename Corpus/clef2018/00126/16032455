A case of cardiac tamponade following esophageal resection. We report a rare case of cardiac tamponade after esophageal resection for esophageal cancer. A 69-year-old man underwent subtotal esophagectomy and reconstruction of the gastric tube with cervical anastomosis via the poststernal route and three-field lymphadectomy via a median sternotomy. On postoperative day 4, the patient developed dyspnea, chest oppression, and hemodynamic instability due to cardiac tamponade. Emergency percutaneous catheter drainage was performed to manage the cardiac tamponade. Acute pericarditis due to the original surgical procedure was suspected to be the cause of the tamponade. Although rare, cardiac tamponade should be considered as a cause of hemodynamic instability after esophageal resection.
