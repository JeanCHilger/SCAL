Laryngeal reconstruction by platysma myofascial flap after vertical partial laryngectomy. Many methods of glottic reconstruction have been described for patients undergoing vertical partial laryngectomy to reestablish the glottic integrity.Fifteen patients with T2 squamous cell carcinoma of the glottis were included in this prospective clinical trial. All patients were treated by vertical partial laryngectomy with laryngeal reconstruction by platysma myofascial flap. The surgical procedure and flap design were described. Vocal function was assessed by videolaryngostroboscopy and subjective and objective voice analysis before and after surgery.Complete neoglottic closure and acceptable voice quality were obtained by platysma myofascial flap in all cases. No statistically significant difference was found between the preoperative and postoperative acoustic parameters.Platysma myofascial flap provides the basic requirements for laryngeal reconstruction with its own favorable characteristics and also allows complete glottic closure without interfering with respiration and deglutition. This technique may be an effective alternative achieving an acceptable quality of voice.
