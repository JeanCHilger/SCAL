Methods for increasing the reliability and noise protection of arterial pressure measurement channel. Noninvasive measurement of arterial blood pressure is an important function of modem monitoring systems. Presently, most arterial pressure measurement channels implement oscillometric method. This method is based on detection of small-amplitude pulsation of limb volume below occlusion cuff during compression/decompression. The main goal of the upgrade to the oscillometric method is to increase the accuracy, reliability, and noise protection of detection of arterial pressure parameters. This work describes a possible approach to improvement of reliability of the oscillographic method based on synchronous detection of several signals (e.g., volume signal, tachosignal and its derivatives with simultaneous correction of signal processing data on the bases of a priori information about signal, and processing adaptation of data processing algorithm to given signal realization).
