Observation of the cognition and the velocities of blood in the brain in cerebral arteriosclerosis and infarct patients. To observe the change of the cognition and the supply of blood in brain in healthy people and patients with arteriosclerosis (AS) and cerebral infarct.1) control group: healthy people, 30 cases. 2) AS group: 22 cases with cerebral arteriosclerosis. Cerebrovascular infarct patients were divided into two groups. 3) 2W group: 21 cases, the patients' course of disease was shorter than two weeks. 4) 6M group: 20 cases, the patients' course of disease was from six months to four years. All cases were checked with cognitive P300 and transcranial doppler ultrasound (TCD) and mini-mental status examination (MMSE).The result revealed that the P300 incubation period in 2W group, 6M group and the AS group was remarkable extend than the control group (P<0.01), meanwhile the period of the 6M group was longer than the AS group (P<0.05) the amplitude of the wave of the 2W group and 6M group were shorter than the control group (P<0.05There are some changes in the P300 and abnormality of brain blood supply in the cerebral infarct patients and AS patients. The longer the course, the more serious of the cognition with the patients.
