Prevalence of asymptomatic atherothrombotic lesions and risk of vascular events in patients with documented coronary artery disease. Coronary arteries are the most frequent location of atherosclerosis. Coronary artery disease is the first cause of death related to atherothrombosis. In addition, patients with a prior history of acute coronary syndromes exhibit a 10% annual risk of recurrence. Although there seems to be a close correlation between the extension of CAD and the severity of atherosclerotic lesions in extra coronary arterial beds, the prevalence of these extracoronary asymptomatic lesions depends on their location. Hence, the prevalence of renal artery disease defined as stenosis > or = 50% or of peripheral artery disease defined as an ABI < 0.9 is estimated to be 20% up to 30%, whereas the prevalence of both carotid artery disease defined as stenosis > or = 70% or aortic aneurysm is estimated to be 5%. Conversely, the annual absolute risk of stroke among CAD patients is estimated at 1% while it remains unknown for vascular events related to PAD or aortic lesions. These data suggest that a systematic screening for asymptomatic extracoronary atherosclerotic lesions among CAD patients cannot be justified without a better knowledge of the prevalence of these lesions. In addition, the identification of the predicting factors for the presence and the development of these asymptomatic lesions is warranted. Finally, the potential benefit in terms of therapeutic intervention of such screening needs to be evaluated. These important issues warrant further clinical studies with appropriate design.
