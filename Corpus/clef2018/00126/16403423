Renovascular disease imaging: today more than ever the invasive cardiologist may make the difference. Doppler ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are gaining wide acceptance as gold standard for diagnosing peripheral artery disease at thoracic and abdominal aorta level and infrainguinal arteries. A different case is that of renal artery stenosis (RAS): noninvasive techniques, CT and MRI in particular, failed to become the new gold standard. Image interpretation and artifacts seems to invalidate MRI and CT sensitivity and specificity that remain quite low. The debacle of noninvasive imaging of renal arteries may have important reflexes on the invasive cardiology practice. In the light of the results of noninvasive tests for renal artery stenosis, the angiography of renal vessels performed at the time of coronary artery angiography may became a new tool for invasive professional to optimize the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis at least in patients scheduled for coronary angiography. The invasive cardiologist, today more than ever, has the chance to really impact the diagnosis and therapy of patients with renovascular disease and the prognosis of patients with both coronary artery and renal artery disease.
