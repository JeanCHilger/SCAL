Evaluation of pediatric oncology patients with previous multiple central catheters for vascular access: is Doppler ultrasound needed? Pediatric oncology patients who have undergone placement of multiple central venous catheters may have thrombosis or stenosis in the upper venous system. The purpose of this study was to identify factors that predict venous thrombosis or stenosis and to evaluate the role of Doppler ultrasonography in assessing the upper venous system of pediatric patients requiring multiple central vascular catheters.The medical records of eligible patients were reviewed with regard to demographics, primary disease, type of catheter, duration of previous central venous access, association with infection, operative notes, and Doppler ultrasonographic findings.Our evaluation criteria were met in 50 cases (47 patients). In 10 cases, Doppler ultrasonography revealed abnormality in the upper venous system. Patient demographics, primary disease, type of catheter, duration of previous central venous access, or association with infection were not found to significantly predict the abnormality in the upper venous system. Placement of central venous access device was performed without difficulty when the site of placement was chosen on the basis of ultrasonographic findings.Doppler ultrasonography is useful in diagnosing thrombosis or stenosis in asymptomatic pediatric patients requiring placement of multiple central venous catheters.
