Association of serum albumin and homocysteine levels and cardio-ankle vascular index in patients with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. The cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) is a newly developed arteriosclerotic measurement that has been proposed as an alternative to aortic pulse-wave velocity (PWV). The present study used the CAVI to identify the main factors associated with arteriosclerosis in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients.Fifteen CAPD patients were enrolled in the study. The CAVI is independent of the pressure and vascular reflection between the heart valve and the ankle. Serum albumin, uric acid, total calcium, phosphorus, lipid levels, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and homocysteine concentrations in CAPD patients were measured using standard methods. Total body fat mass, truncal and non-truncal fat mass and lean body mass were measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry with a Lunar DPX-L scanner.CAPD patients had a mean CAVI of 9.37 +/- 3.16 m/sec, which was higher than the general population. The CAVI was negatively correlated with the serum albumin concentration (r=-0.548 p=0.034). Stepwise regression analysis showed that both the serum albumin concentration (beta=-0.643, p=0.013) and the serum homocysteine level (beta=0.486, p=0.004) were independently associated with the CAVI.An increase in CAVI was independently associated with both serum albumin and homocysteine level.
