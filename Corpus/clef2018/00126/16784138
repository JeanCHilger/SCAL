Clinical features of the hand-arm vibration syndrome in miners. It is well known that the vibrating tools used by the miners can cause hand-arm vibration syndrome. However no detailed reports on this field could be found in the Hungarian literature.The aim of this study was to clarify the clinical features of the hand-arm vibration syndrome of the miners.The circulation, the peripheral nerves and the osteoarticular system of the upper extremities of 152 miners were examined by means of cold provocation test, Allen-test, measurement of systolic blood pressure performed by Doppler flowmeter, clinical neurological and neurographic examination and X-ray investigation of the bones and joints.Hand-arm vibration syndrome was diagnosed in 87 patients (57.2%). The most common symptom was the lesion of the circulation which occurred in 78 patients (89.6%). The peripheral nerves were affected in 44 cases (50.5%). Radiological alteration of the bones and joints of the upper extremities was observed in 32 patients (36.8%). Out of 78 damaged cases the frequency of the vascular diseases was as follows: angiopathy (diminished systolic blood pressure in the fingers): 66 patient (84.6%), occlusion of the hand arteries (positive Allen-test) and arterial form of the thoracic outlet syndrome (positive elevation-test) respectively: 28 and 28 cases (35.9%), Raynaud phenomenon (positive cold-provocation test): 26 cases (33.3%). The peripheral nerves were examined in detail in 141 cases. Pathological alterations were observed in 78 patients (55.3%) in the following forms: carpal tunnel syndrome: 66 cases (84.6%), peripheral neuropathy of the upper limbs: 20 patients (25.6%), lesion of the ulnar nerve: 3 cases (3.8%), brachial plexus lesion: one patient (1.3%). Radiological alteration was most common in the carpal region (87 cases, 57.2%). The frequency of the lesion of cubital (40.4%) and shoulder region (40.7%) was practically the same. In the carpal region the most common alterations were the degenerative processes (23 cases, 15.1%) followed by the aseptic osteonecroses (22 patients, 14.5%). In the cubital region the periarticular changes (31 patients, 23.9%) were most common followed by degenerative changes (21 cases, 16.2%) and the osteochondrosis dissecans (13 cases, 10.1%). In the shoulder region the degenerative processes were the most common changes (41 patients, 34.7%), first of all in the acromioclavicular joint (21 cases, 17.8%). Aseptic necrosis was observed in two patients.The miners are professionally exposed not only to hand-arm vibration, but also to increased physical stress. The symptoms on the upper limbs can develop as the result of both exposures.
