Functional assessment of the collateral-dependent circulation in chronic total coronary occlusion using transthoracic Doppler ultrasound and venous adenosine infusion. The measurement of collateral flow reserve (CFR the hyperemic/baseline collateral flow velocity ratio) in patients with chronic total coronary occlusion requires invasive and expensive techniques. Noninvasive transthoracic coronary Doppler echocardiography may be an alternative option. Fifty-one patients with chronic total coronary occlusion were evaluated by transthoracic coronary Doppler echocardiography and venous adenosine infusion to measure CFR in occluded coronary arteries (the left anterior descending artery in 44 patients and the artery supplying the posterior descending artery in 7 patients). CFR data were plotted against 3 angiographic parameters: (1) grade of the epicardial filling of the occluded artery (1=absent, 2=partial, 3=complete), (2) stenosis of the donor artery, and (3) the extent of coronary artery disease (vessels with >or=70% stenosis). Collateral flow was maintained at stress in 34 patients (CFR>or=1, range 1.0 to 2.2) but was withdrawn in 17 patients (CFR<1, range 0.25 to 0.90). CFR increased with the degree of angiographic collateral flow (grade 1: 0.73+/-0.29
