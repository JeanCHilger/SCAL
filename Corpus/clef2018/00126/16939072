Successful management of critical limb ischemia with intravenous sodium thiosulfate in a chronic hemodialysis patient. Vascular calcification is common among hemodialysis (HD) patients and contributes to the development of peripheral arterial disease. A 57-year-old Japanese man who had been on HD for 30 years was referred to us for severe pain with multiple ulcers on his toes and fingers. He was an ex-smoker and had no diabetes mellitus. On admission, he had ulcers on his big toes bilaterally and right 2nd - 4th fingers. Peripheral pulses were strong and his ankle-brachial pressure index was above 1.3. Laboratory data were as follows: calcium 9.9 mg/dl, albumin 3.3 g/dl, phosphate 3.0 mg/dl, Ca x P product 30, and parathyroid hormone 98 pg/ml. He had a parathyroidectomy in 1998 and 1999. X-rays of his hands and legs showed diffuse subcutaneous arteriolar calcification. Angiography revealed no local stenotic lesions. Despite intensive therapies including hyperbaric oxygen therapy, painful gangrene developed on his right big toe and the pain was so intense that he could not go to sleep in a supine position. We infused intravenous sodium thiosulfate (20 g) 3 times weekly, based on previous reports. Within 4 - 5 days, he experienced rapid and dramatic symptom relief. The score of the visual analogue pain scale improved from 10/10 - 2/10. The signs of ischemia, measured by transcutaneous partial oxygen pressure and thermography, improved significantly. During the infusion of sodium thiosulfate, the patient complained of nausea, vomiting and hyperosmia. These adverse symptoms were resolved after discontinuation of the infusion. Pain relief was sustained and he could walk after 2 weeks of infusion. Our case supports the use of sodium thiosulfate as a novel therapeutic choice for critical limb ischemia with severe vascular calcification in chronic HD patients.
