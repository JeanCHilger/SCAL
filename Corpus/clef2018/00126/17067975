The relationship between ankle-brachial index and leisure-time physical activity in patients with intermittent claudication. The purpose of the study was to examine the relationship between ankle-brachial index (ABI) and leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) in patients with peripheral arterial disease limited by intermittent claudication. Patients included 342 sedentary men and women between the ages of 45 and 85 with intermittent claudication confirmed by a resting ABI of less than 0.90. Patients were categorized into either a low ABI group (ABI <0.50 n=84), a middle ABI group (ABI = 0.50 to 0.69
