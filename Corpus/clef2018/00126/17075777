Blood-soluble Fas levels are increased in type 2 diabetic patients with peripheral vascular disease. To investigate the possible utility of plasma sFas (soluble Fas) levels as a marker of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) in type 2 diabetic patients, and the relationship between classical cardiovascular risk factors and sFas levels in these patients.sFas levels were measured in 57 type 2 diabetic patients with and 60 without PVD matched for age and sex. Diagnosis of PVD was established in presence of at least one of the following criteria: leg or foot amputation of vascular cause, lower-extremity arterial angioplasty or surgical by-pass, or ankle-braquial index (ABI) less than 1 in at least one side of the body. ELISA was used to measure sFas levels.None of the risk factors assessed total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, CRP, ACE, fibrinogen, Lp(a) and homocysteine was significantly different between both groups of patients. However, patients with PVD had higher plasma sFas levels than the group without PVD (10.25+/-3.7 ng/ml VS. 8.86+/-2.6 ng/ml p=0.02). Levels of sFas were 1.45 ng/ml (95% CI: 0.32-2.58Plasma sFas may be an independent marker of PVD in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.
