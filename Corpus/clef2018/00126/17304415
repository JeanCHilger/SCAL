Duodenal obstruction secondary to date stone impaction. The use of non-invasive imaging techniques to rapidly establish diagnosis has always been an attempt in emergency situations. Recent significant advances in imaging technology have changed approach and algorithm of many emergencies. We present a case of swallowed date stone resulting in duodenal obstruction in a 10-year old child. Following the suspicion of a foreign body impaction which caused symptoms of acute intestinal obstruction, the case was diagnosed precisely by conventional sonography. This spared the patient the laparotomy scheduled initially. Instead, endoscopic removal of the date stone was accomplished successfully with smooth recovery.
