Bilateral renal artery entrapment by diaphragmatic crura: a rare cause of renovascular hypertension with a specific management. We present the case of a young man with compression of both renal arteries by the crura of the diaphragm. Correct diagnosis of renal artery entrapment is difficult but crucial. The investigations rely on an high index of suspicion and include Doppler ultrasound and spiral computed tomography angiography, which permits visualization of the diaphragm and its relationships with the aorta. This pathology, unlike common renal artery stenoses, requires surgical decompression and sometimes aortorenal bypass graft.
