Microvascular dysfunction in rheumatoid arthritis assessed by laser Doppler anemometry: relationship to soluble adhesion molecules and extraarticular manifestations. In search of a noninvasive diagnostic test for rheumatoid vasculitis (RV), this study addressed the questions whether changes in capillary blood cell velocity (CBV) detected by laser Doppler anemometry in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were correlated with the levels of soluble adhesion molecules and whether cutaneous flow abnormalities may reflect extraarticular manifestations in RA. In 31 RA patients and 20 patients with osteoarthritis (OA), CBV was measured in the skin above the left ring finger at rest and after 3-min arterial occlusion. Serum levels of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), soluble E-selectin (sE-selectin), and soluble P-selectin (sP-selectin) were assessed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Peak CBV was reduced in RA patients compared to OA patients (0.42 +/- 0.07 mm/s vs. 0.70 +/- 0.13 mm/s P = 0.013). Both CBV during rest and reactive hyperemia were not correlated with the levels of soluble adhesion molecules. There were no significant differences in resting or peak CBV between RA patients with or without extraarticular manifestations. The lack of an inverse correlation between the levels of soluble adhesion molecules and CBV during rest and reactive hyperemia contradicts the assumption that inflammatory vascular damage indicated by increased levels of soluble adhesion molecules was the main reason for the impairment of microcirculation. The present results do not suggest that cutaneous flow abnormalities may reflect extraarticular manifestations in RA.
