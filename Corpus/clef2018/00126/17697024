Alterations in the peripheral circulation in COPD patients. Although various factors influence peripheral circulation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients, little is known about the vasomotor changes in these subjects.The present study was designed to assess alterations in the brachial circulation of COPD patients.Twenty-five COPD patients and 25 healthy subjects were studied. Brachial artery (BA) blood flow and indices of BA stiffness were investigated by two-dimensional ultrasonography and pulsed Doppler. Cardiac dimensions, left ventricular (LV) function and cardiac output were assessed by pulsed Doppler echocardiography.A significant increase in LV mass was observed in the COPD group despite normal arterial pressure. Total arterial compliance and BA compliance were significantly decreased in COPD patients in comparison with healthy subjects. Heart rate was increased in COPD patients and was inversely correlated with PaO(2) and forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV(1)). A decrease in LV preload was expressed by a reduction in LV diastolic diameters and LV stroke volume. Patients with severe COPD have a lower BA surface area than patients with moderate COPD. FEV(1) and PaO(2) were significantly related to BA compliance.In COPD patients, significant alterations in the peripheral circulation were observed. Moreover, the magnitude of changes in the peripheral circulation was related to the severity of COPD.
