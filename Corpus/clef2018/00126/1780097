Syndrome of the aortic arch and rheumatic polymyalgia. Description of a case. The paper reports a recently observed case of a 76-year-old man suffering from claudication of the upper limbs, undetectable brachial pressure and bilateral absence of radial, brachial and axillary pulses. During the previous two years the patient had complained of symptoms reminiscent of polymyalgia rheumatica. On admission to hospital, he also presented elevated ESR without temporal arteritic symptoms or involvement of other arterial districts, excluding the main supra-aortic branches, and without ocular signs. Arteriography showed the typical radiological findings of arteritis with bilateral occlusion of the subclavian arteries. Steroid therapy, which was commenced without previous histological biopsy, resulted in a clear subjective and objective improvement in the patient's condition. Following a review of the literature, the A. focus on the incidence of extra-temporal localisations of arteritis associated with polymyalgia rheumatica and on other related problems. They emphasise the importance of beginning steroid therapy as early as possible.
