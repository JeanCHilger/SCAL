A case of afferent loop syndrome treated by endoscopic drainage procedure using nasogastric tube. Afferent loop syndrome is an uncommon complication which occurs in patients with Billroth II partial gastrectomy. Clinically, the diagnosis of afferent loop syndrome may be difficult to establish and thus, depends on the finding of computed tomography, abdominal ultrasound, barium studies and hepatobiliary scan. When the diagnosis is made, most of the cases are treated by surgical operation. We present a case of 67-year-old male patient with afferent loop syndrome associated with acute pancreatitis which was treated by endoscopic drainage procedure using a nasogastric tube.
