Effect of platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist on survival of epigastric island flaps in rats with total venous occlusions. We evaluated the effect of tirofiban hydrochloride on the survival of epigastric island flaps in rats that had had all the veins occluded. Male Wistar Albino rats were randomly assigned to control (treated with sterile saline) and experimental (treated with tirofiban hydrochloride 1 mg/kg intravenously) groups. An epigastric island skin flap 3x6 cm was raised in each rat. All veins that drained the flap were ligated to give total venous occlusion. Blood flow was recorded by laser Doppler preoperatively (baseline), immediately after the flap had been sutured back to its original position (acute) and on postoperative days 1 and 3. The degree of necrosis was evaluated on day 3. Mean percentage necrosis and minimum laser Doppler values were compared in the two groups. Total necrosis was evident on day 1 in the control group and on day 3 in the experimental group. Macroscopic evidence was confirmed by histopathological examination. There were appreciable differences in blood flow and in the necrotic area of the flap in the experimental group compared with the control group on both days 1 and 3. Tirofiban hydrochloride might be effective in this flap model.
