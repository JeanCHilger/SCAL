Self-expandable stent placement in infrapopliteal arteries after unsuccessful angioplasty failure: one-year follow-up. The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate whether stent placement in infrapopliteal arteries is helpful in failed percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). Infrapopliteal PTA was performed in 70 arteries of 66 patients with chronic critical lower limb ischemia. The group comprised 55 males and 11 females, with an average age of 63.4 (range, 42-82) years. Diabetes mellitus was present in 92.4% of patients. Only the palpable anterior tibial and posterior tibial arteries were evaluated. Stents (Xpert stent Abbot Vascular, Redwood City, CA, USA) were placed in 16 arteries where PTA was not successful (the failure was defined as residual stenosis >30% after PTA). In 54 arteries simple PTA was performed and was technically successful. Twenty-four nondilated arteries with no significant stenosis served as a comparison group. The 12-month patency rate was evaluated according to a combination of palpation and Doppler ultrasound. In all cases stent placement restored the flow in the artery immediately after unsuccessful PTA. Twelve-month follow-up showed a patency rate of 82% in the PTA group, 78% in the stent group, and 69% in the comparison group. We conclude that stent placement in the case of unsuccessful infrapopliteal PTA changed technical failure to success and restored flow in the dilated artery. At 12-month follow-up the patency rate of infrapopliteal arteries stented for PTA failure did not differ significantly either from nonstented arteries with an optimal PTA result or from a comparison group of nonintervened arteries.
