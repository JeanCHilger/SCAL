Combined percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and extraanatomic bypass for symptomatic unilateral iliac artery occlusion with contralateral iliac artery stenosis. We have reviewed our experience with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of contralateral iliac stenosis and extraanatomic bypass of the occluded iliac artery. Twenty-two men and nine women with a mean age of 65 years (range 46 to 84) presented with symptomatic iliac occlusive disease. Twenty-four (77%) had disabling claudication, four (13%) rest pain, and three (10%) ischemic tissue loss. Six (19%) had undergone previous vascular reconstructive procedures. All had an occluded iliac artery on the symptomatic side and greater than 50% stenosis of the contralateral iliac artery. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the iliac stenosis was done prior to extraanatomic bypass, using polytetrafluoroethylene. There were six late deaths after discharge. The only significant complication was a femoral artery thrombosis which was corrected when the bypass graft was performed. Cumulative primary graft patency was 89% at one year and 81% at three years. The crossover graft occluded in six patients, five within 48 months of surgery, and one after nine years. One of these occluded grafts was salvaged by thrombectomy, for a secondary patency rate of 85% at three years. Two patients required aortobifemoral bypass, one an iliobifemoral bypass and one an ilioprofunda bypass. One patient operated upon for rest pain came to below-knee amputation. Mean resting ankle/brachial systolic pressure index increased significantly on the side of the iliac occlusion from 0.35 +/- 0.21 to 0.70 +/- 0.20 (p less than 0.05, paired t test) after the combined procedure. There was no significant difference in the mean resting ankle/brachial systolic pressure index on the contralateral side (0.60 +/- 0.22 to 0.65 +/- 0.27, ns).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
