Gastric distension attenuates the hypotensive effect of intraduodenal glucose in healthy older subjects. Postprandial hypotension occurs frequently, and current management is suboptimal. Recent studies suggest that the magnitude of the fall in postprandial blood pressure (BP) may be attenuated by gastric distension. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of gastric distension on the hypotensive response to intraduodenal (ID) glucose. Eight healthy subjects (5 males, 3 females, aged 65-76 years) received an ID infusion of either 1) 50 g glucose in 300 ml saline (ID glucose) over 60 min (t=0-60 min), 2) 50 g glucose in 300 ml saline over 60 min and intragastric (4) infusion of 500 ml water between t=7-10 min (IG water and ID glucose), or 3) ID saline (0.9%) infusion over 60 min and IG infusion of 500 ml water (IG water and ID saline) all followed by ID saline infusion for another 60 min (t=60-120 min) on three separate days. BP and heart rate (HR) were measured. Gastric emptying (GE) of the IG water was quantified by two-dimensional ultrasonography. Between t=0-60 min, systolic and diastolic BP was greater (P<0.05 for both) with IG water and ID saline compared with IG water and ID glucose, and less (P<0.05 for both) with ID glucose compared with IG water and ID glucose. These effects were evident at relatively low IG volumes (approximately 300 ml). GE was faster with IG water and ID saline when compared with IG water and ID glucose. We conclude that, in healthy older subjects, IG administration of water markedly attenuates the hypotensive response to ID glucose, presumably as a result of gastric distension.
