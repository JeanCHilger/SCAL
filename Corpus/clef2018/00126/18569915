Determination of the impact of hepatitis C virus on insulin resistance and arterial stiffness in hemodialysis patients. It has been shown that Hepatitis C virus (HCV) seropositivity and carotis artery plaque formation are independently correlated in the general population. Insulin resistance is also a risk factor for atherosclerosis. The association between HCV and type 2 diabetes mellitus is known. Determination of the impact of HCV on insulin resistance and arterial stiffness in hemodialysis patients would help to prevent related cardiovascular complications.Thirty-seven HCV(+) and 30 HCV(-) HD patients were enrolled in this study. All patients were non-diabetic. Insulin resistance was assessed by "HOMA-IR." Arterial stiffness was measured by "stiffness index b" and "elastic modulus."In the HCV(+) group, there were 20 males and 17 females, while the HCV(-) group had 19 males and 11 females. The mean age was 43.4 +/- 16.7 years and 44.5 +/- 16.8 years, respectively. The HOMA-IR was 1.50 in HCV(+) group and 1.31 in HCV(-) group (p > 0.05). Stiffness index b and elastic modulus measurements revealed no difference between groups. In the HCV(+) group, arterial stiffness parameters were correlated with age, white blood cell, thrombocyte, total and LDL cholesterol, uric acid, mean arterial pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and HOMA-IR. There was no association between arterial stiffness and the above-mentioned parameters in the HCV(-) group.We found that there was no association of arterial stiffness in HCV(+) patients with insulin resistance. Further studies with larger patient groups and more sensitive methods of detecting HCV are needed. This study is the first in literature on this issue.
