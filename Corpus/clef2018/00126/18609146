Characteristics of intestinal tuberculosis in ultrasonographic techniques. There is a paucity of data on the sonographic criteria for the diagnosis of intestinal tuberculosis. The purpose of this study was to further characterize the potential sonographic signs of intestinal tuberculosis and to increase the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound.Seven patients with a final diagnosis of gastrointestinal tuberculosis and a control group of 18 patients suffering from tuberculosis limited to the lungs were prospectively evaluated for sonographic criteria of intestinal tuberculosis and the findings were compared with those in 50 healthy controls.The following signs of intestinal tuberculosis were detectable: asymmetric thickened bowel wall (100%), intramural abscesses (86%), fistula (43%), extramural abscesses (29%), mesenteric thickening (29%), "white bowel" sign (29%), hypoechoic edema of Kerckring's folds with mesenterial thrombosis (14%), enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes with inhomogeneous echotexture and circumscribed hypoechoic spots <3 mm (86%), ascites (29%) and enlarged spleen (14%). These signs were exclusively present in patients with intestinal tuberculosis as compared with patients with tuberculosis limited to the lungs or with healthy controls. We could confirm the endoscopically reported right-sided prevalence of these wall thickenings. In contrast to the reported literature, a much higher prevalence of these sonographic signs was found as they were present in all patients. Six of 7 patients (86%) showed enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes. This was particularly interesting as mesenteric lymph nodes have not been described as being enlarged in the majority of other differential diagnoses of the ileocecal region.The combination of bowel-wall thickening of the ileocecal region with intramural abscesses with or without fistula, abscesses and mesenteric thickening accompanied by enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes was highly predictive of intestinal tuberculosis.
