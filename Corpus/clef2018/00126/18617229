Percutaneous transesophageal gastrotubing: alternative tube nutrition for a patient with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. We report a patient who underwent percutaneous transesophageal gastrotubing (PTEG), that is, nonsurgical esophagostomy under ultrasonographic control, as an alternative to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).The PTEG was placed for shunt protection from inadvertent infection in a 29-year-old male patient in whom a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt had previously been inserted. During the 3-year follow-up period, no complications associated with PTEG were experienced.Percutaneous transesophageal gastrotubing is a good alternative to PEG in a patient with a VP shunt. Further investigation concerning the risk of infection related to PTEG and PEG in VP shunt patients is needed.
