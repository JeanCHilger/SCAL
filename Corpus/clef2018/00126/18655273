Optimization of the components of regulation of vascular tone and microcirculatory hemostasis during prolonged regional block in local cold injury. The impact of prolonged conduction block of the brachial plexus on the regulatory components of vascular tone, the state of vascular platelet hemostasis, and the activity of an inflammatory process was studied in patients with second-to-fourth degree local arm frostbites. The block alleviated arterial spasm, indirectly lowered myogenic tone, and decreased shunt blood flow. Nutritive circulation increased in the presence of a total increase in blood flow to the arm. There were increases in the intensity, rate, and potential of platelet aggregation. The concentration of proinflammatory cytokines reduced. This resulted in more efficient treatment.
