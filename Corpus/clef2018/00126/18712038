Comparison of renal and vascular protective effects between telmisartan and amlodipine in hypertensive patients with chronic kidney disease with mild renal insufficiency. The present study was conducted to compare the renal and vascular protective effects of telmisartan and amlodipine in untreated hypertensive chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with moderate renal insufficiency. Thirty hypertensive CKD patients were randomly assigned to receive telmisartan 40 mg (n = 15) or amlodipine 5 mg (n = 15) once daily for 12 months. Changes in blood pressure, serum creatinine, 24-h creatinine clearance (Ccr), proteinuria, brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), intima-media thickness (IMT), plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6), plasma matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and lipid profiles were monitored in all patients. Before treatment, there were no significant differences in these parameters between the telmisartan and amlodipine groups. Over the 12 month observation period, blood pressure decreased equally in both groups. However, serum creatinine, proteinuria, baPWV, IMT, plasma levels of IL-6 and MMP-9 and total cholesterol decreased and 24-h Ccr increased more strikingly in the telmisartan group than the amlodipine group. These data suggest that telmisartan is more effective than amlodipine for protecting renovascular functions, and potentially for ameliorating atherosclerosis, in hypertensive CKD patients with moderate renal insufficiency.
