Successful percutaneous drainage of duodenal hematoma after blunt trauma. Duodenal hematoma after blunt trauma is usually treated nonoperatively with bowel rest, nasogastric tube suction, and intravenous hydration. We report a case in which obstructive symptoms persisted despite more than 2 weeks of conservative management. An ultrasound-guided percutaneous drain was placed, with successful resolution of symptoms.
