Multiple jejunoileal atresia and colonic atresia managed by multiple primary anastomosis with a single gastroperineal transanastomotic tube without stomas. Multiple jejunoileal atresia is a challenge to the pediatric surgeon. The aim of the study is to preserve bowel length and prevent the long-term complications of short bowel syndrome. The authors present a rare case of combined multiple jejunoileal atresia and colonic atresia managed by 9 primary anastomoses over a gastroperineal transanastomotic tube. This technique avoided the use of stomas and their attendant complications.
