Beneficial effects of combination therapy with angiotensin II receptor blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor on vascular endothelial function. The combination of angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers has been shown to be more effective than the individual drugs alone in the treatment of chronic kidney disease and chronic heart failure. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of treatment with the calcium channel blocker amlodipine or the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril on vascular endothelial function and arteriosclerosis in patients with essential hypertension who had already been receiving angiotensin receptor blocker monotherapy. Thirty-two patients with essential hypertension treated with angiotensin receptor blocker monotherapy were randomized to receive 5 mg of amlodipine (n=16) or 4 mg of perindopril (n=16) once daily in the morning for 24 weeks. The patients were evaluated before and after therapy to assess changes in blood pressure, flow-mediated vasodilation (a parameter of vascular endothelial function), and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (a parameter of arteriosclerosis). Before treatment, there were no significant differences in the above parameters between groups. After treatment, there was a similar significant decrease in blood pressure in both groups. Flow-mediated vasodilation increased significantly in the perindopril group compared with the amlodipine group however, the decrease in brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity was not significantly different between groups. In conclusion, these results suggest that the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril is superior to the calcium channel blocker amlodipine for reducing vascular endothelial dysfunction when co-administered with angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with essential hypertension.
