Stent migration as a late complication following carotid angioplasty and stenting. A 69-year-old male patient with severe asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis was treated percutaneously with implant of two self-expandable stents in the right carotid overlapped to each other by 5 mm. The 15-month follow-up colour-Doppler ultrasound (CDU) revealed a severe stenosis in the target vessel and an image suggesting migration of the distal stent.Physical examination, laboratory test, CDU, carotid angiography, quantitative carotid angiography (QCA), brain computed tomography (CT).Migration of the distal stent associated with severe stenosis on the unsupported arterial segment.Carotid artery angiography, QCA, antithrombotic therapy, carotid artery angioplasty and stenting (CAS).
