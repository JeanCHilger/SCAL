Comparative study of the cardio-ankle vascular index and ankle-brachial index between young Japanese and Mongolian subjects. Mongolian people have higher mortality and morbidity rates due to cardiovascular disease (CVD) than Japanese people. The cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) and ankle-brachial index (ABI) are both atherosclerosis-related indexes. Presently, there is no comparative information on CAVI and ABI among young subjects between Mongolian and Japanese people. A total of one hundred Mongolian (men: 39%, mean age: 20.9+/-2.2 years) and 115 Japanese volunteers (men: 39%, mean age: 22.0+/-1.8 years) were recruited from among university students. The body mass index (BMI), heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), CAVI, ABI, carotid intima-media thickness, blood total cholesterol (TC), glucose and C reactive protein levels were measured. The levels of BMI, HR and diastolic BP were significantly higher, and TC and glucose were significantly lower in the Mongolian subjects than in the Japanese subjects. The CAVI values (median (interquartile range): 6.5 (5.8-7.0) vs. 5.6 (5.2-6.0)) and ABI (1.11 (1.05-1.17) vs. 1.09 (1.05-1.15)) were significantly higher in the Mongolian subjects than in the Japanese subjects. The patterns of correlation between CAVI, ABI and other atherosclerotic parameters were different: in age-, gender- and BMI-adjustment correlation tests for CAVI and ABI, HR (r=-0.25 for CAVI and ABI) showed a correlation in the Mongolian subjects, and for ABI systolic BP (r=-0.28) showed a correlation in the Japanese subjects. These results suggest that Mongolian subjects may be at higher risk of CVD, even among younger individuals, than Japanese subjects.
