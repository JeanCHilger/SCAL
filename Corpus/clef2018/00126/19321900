Methods for the assessment of gastric emptying in critically ill, enterally fed adults. Critically ill patients may experience delayed gastric emptying. Patients receiving enteral feeding are monitored closely to detect a delay of gastric emptying, assess feeding tolerance, and prevent aspiration pneumonia. The most common practice for assessing gastric emptying is to measure the aspirated gastric residual volume however, this is an unreliable method that lacks standardization, fails to differentiate normal digestive secretions from enteral formula, and results in unnecessary interruptions of enteral nutrition. The aim of this review is to identify an alternative method to assess gastric emptying, which should be reliable, sensitive, harmless, feasible, and inexpensive. Several techniques are discussed: scintigraphy, paracetamol absorption test, breath tests, refractometry, ultrasound, and gastric impedance monitoring. Refractometry seems to be the most appropriate tool for the regular assessment of enteral nutrition
