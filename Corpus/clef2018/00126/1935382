Anatomic variations in the course of the left hepatic artery. A problem for systematic lymphadenectomy in gastrectomy or proximal stomach resection before stomach tube formation. In 21 patients resected for gastric or esophageal malignancy an aberrant left hepatic artery from the left gastric artery was found. The study shows that in systematic lymphadenectomy ligation of the left gastric artery distally from the origin can safely preserve an aberrant hepatic artery without impairment of oncological quality. Related to a control group no difference in the number of resected lymph-nodes and the operation time was observed. Postoperatively there was no problem concerning liver function and surgical morbidity. In real-time sonography the aberrant artery could be postoperatively seen precisely in 19%, but duplex signal was found in 63%. Limited visualization in sonography may be caused by technical problems due to anatomy and overlying air from small-bowel reconstruction after gastrectomy.
