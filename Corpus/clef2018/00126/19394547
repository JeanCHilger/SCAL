Functional popliteal artery entrapment syndrome: A poorly understood and often missed diagnosis that is frequently mistreated. Functional popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (FPAES) is an uncommon overuse injury in young physically active adults manifest by neuromuscular symptoms (gastroc/soleus cramping, plantar paresthesias). It is commonly confused with chronic recurrent exertional compartment syndrome (CRECS). This study evaluated the diagnostic testing, mechanism of injury, and treatment differences between FPAES and CRECS.Between 1987 and 2007, 854 patients (557 women, 297 men mean age, 28.5 years) were surgically treated for the diagnosis of CRECS or FPAES, or both. Compartment pressures were measured in all patients who had anterior lateral or posterior superficial calf symptoms (normal pressure <or=15 mm Hg). Noninvasive stress positional plethysmography was routine. Stress positional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or angiography (MRA) was performed on patients with positive plethysmography result and symptoms consistent with FPAES.Of the 854 patients, 757 (95%) had elevated compartment pressures (>or=25 mm Hg), and fasciectomy was performed for CRECS under local anesthesia (anterior lateral, 508 posterior superficial, 191FPAES and CRECS occur in the same population with similar symptoms but require different treatment.
