Surgical treatment of vertebrobasilar insufficiency. The results of surgical correction of blood flow in the vertebrobasilar basin in 58 patients ranging in age from 32 to 65 years were analysed. In 75.9% of cases, the disease was secondary to atherosclerosis. The tortuosity of the vertebral artery was noted in 12% of the patients. Transitory symptoms of ischemia were observed in 20.6% of the patients, chronic vascular cerebral insufficiency--in 53.6%, sequelae to the ischemic insult--in 25.8%. For diagnosis, the Doppler ultrasound, rheoencephalography, computerized tomography were used. The preference was given to extracranial operative interventions: +carotid-subclavian shunting was performed in 19, +intimo-thrombectomy from the subclavian and ostium of the vertebral artery--in 22, ++aorto-subclavian shunting--in 3 patients. Plasty of the vertebral artery was accomplished in 12 patients. The positive dynamics of neurologic status was noted in 91.3% of the patients.
