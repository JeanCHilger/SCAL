Quantification of liver perfusion by dynamic magnetic resonance imaging: experimental evaluation and clinical pilot study. Changes in liver microcirculation are considered essential in assessing ischemia-reperfusion injury, which in turn has an impact on liver graft function and outcome following liver transplantation (LTx). The aim of this study was to introduce dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) as a new technique for overall quantification of hepatic microcirculation and compare it to perfusion measured by laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF hepatic artery/portal vein) and thermal diffusion (TD). The study included 3 groups, measuring hepatic blood flow and microcirculation with the help of TD, LDF, and dMRI. In group I (9 landrace pigs
