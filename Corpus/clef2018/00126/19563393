Lipid lowering versus pleiotropic effects of statins on skin microvascular function in patients with dysglycaemia and coronary artery disease. To investigate the impact of lipid lowering therapy by different means on skin microvascular function in patients with dysglycaemia and coronary artery disease (CAD).Thirty-six patients were randomized to simvastatin 80 mg daily (S80, n = 19) or ezetimibe 10 mg and simvastatin 10 mg daily (E10/S10, n = 17) for 6 weeks. Skin microvascular function was assessed by laser Doppler fluxmetry (LDF) at rest, following arterial occlusion (peak postocclusive LDF) and following local heating on the forearm (heat arm LDF) and foot (heat foot LDF). LDF parameters and serum lipids were evaluated at baseline and follow-up.At follow-up, LDL cholesterol had decreased from 3.1 (2.7-3.5) to 1.6 (1.5-1.8) (mmol L(-1)) and 3.0 (2.4-3.9) to 1.3 (1.1-1.8) (mmol L(-1)) in the E10/S10 and S80 groups respectively. In the entire study group (n = 32), LDF parameters increased significantly postocclusive LDF from 22 (17-27) to 26 (21-32) perfusion units (PU) (P < 0.001), heat foot LDF from 61 (44-82) to 66 (45-83) PU (P < 0.001) and heat arm LDF from 60 (48-121) to 75 (54-125) PU (P < 0.01). The changes in LDF parameters did not differ between the E10/S10 and S80 groups.Lipid lowering improves microvascular function in patients with dysglycaemia and CAD. The data suggest that lipid lowering per se is more important than pleiotropic effects of statins for this effect.
