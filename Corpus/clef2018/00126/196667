Cyclic GMP-dependent and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases, protein kinase modulators and phosphodiesterases in arteries and veins of dogs. Distribution and effects of arteriovenous fistula and arterial occlusion. Possible involvement of cyclic GMP-dependent and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases, protein kinase modulators and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases in functions of vascular tissues were investigated in the dog. All of the above activities, localized in the smooth muscle-rich inner layer of the blood vessels, were found to be higher in the arteries than in the veins. The peripheral arteries were disproportionately richer in cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (as indicated by high ratios of cyclic GMP-dependent to cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase) than were the veins, with the exception of the pulmonary artery, an atypical arterial tissue exposed to low blood pressure. Interestingly, the protein kinase ratio for the aorta, an artery with no significant role in blood pressure regulation, was not higher than that for the vena cava. Creation of femoral arteriovenous fistulae in the dogs led to preferential reductions in the cyclic GMP-dependent enzyme activity both in the proximal and distal arteries, whereas it was elevated in the stressed vein distal to the anastomotic site. The cyclic GMP-dependent enzyme was preferentially reduced in the saphenous artery distal to occlusion. Changes in the cyclic GMP-dependent enzyme activity appeared to precede gross atrophy or hypertrophy of the vessels. It is suggested that the vascular cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase may be closely related to peripheral resistance and its regulation.
