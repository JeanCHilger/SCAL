Relationship between serum resistin level and large arterial elasticity in patients with essential hypertension. To investigate the association between serum resistin concentration and large arterial elasticity in patients with essential hypertension (EH).271 recruited subjects were divided into the control group (n = 134) and EH group (n = 137). Blood pressure, waist circumference, hip, body mass index (BMI) were measured. Serum resistin concentration was assessed by enzyme immunoassay, fasting serum insulin and TNF-alpha were measured using radioimmunity kits. Insulin resistance was evaluated by insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR). Brachial ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) was tested by the full-automatic arteriosclerosis diagnostic instrument.(1) The serum resistin concentration, baPWV and TNF-alpha were significantly increased in EH group compared to the control group [(0.65 +/- 0.12) ng/ml vs (0.59 +/- 0.13) ng/ml (1513.24 +/- 182.30) cm/s vs (1301.69 +/- 151.15) cm/sLarge arterial elasticity was decreased in proportion to increasing serum resistin level in hypertensive patients.
