Hybrid surgical and endovascular therapy in multifocal peripheral TASC D lesions: up to three-year follow-up. The authors described their three-year experience with hybrid surgical and endovascular therapy for multifocal peripheral TASC D lesions, involving both the aortoiliac and/or superficial femoral and common femoral arteries.From February 2005 to March 2008, 21 lower limbs in 20 patients with multifocal peripheral artery disease, involving the aortoiliac and/or superficial femoral as well as common femoral arteries, were treated by hybrid surgical and endovascular therapy, such as aortoiliac and/or superficial femoral artery stenting as an adjunct to common femoral artery endarterectomy. Technical and hemodynamic success as well as primary and primary assisted patency and limb salvage rates were determined in concordance with the Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines.All lower limbs successfully underwent successful hybrid surgical and endovascular therapy. The average ABPI before and after hybrid therapy significantly increased from 0.50 +/- 0.32 to 0.79 +/- 0.24 (P = 0.0022). The mean duration of follow-up was 357 days (range, 4 to 1400 days). Over all, the primary patency rates were 94%, 70% and 70% at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively, and the primary assisted patency rates were 94% at 24 months. The limb salvage rate was 100% at 24 months. The survival rates were 95%, 88%, and 88% at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. The primary patency rate for intermittent claudication was significantly higher that that for critical limb ischemia, while no significant difference was found in the assisted primary patency and survival rates between intermittent claudication and critical limb ischemia.Hybrid surgical and endovascular therapy, such as aortoiliac and/or superficial femoral artery stenting as an adjunct to common femoral artery endarterectomy, can provide a less invasive yet effective and durable option to patients with multifocal peripheral artery disease.
