Gastrointestinal radiology from the time of Walter B. Cannon to the 21st century. From its very inception, gastrointestinal radiology was at the forefront of radiology, combining physiologic and anatomic information. From evaluation of esophageal motility to the first depiction of gastric ulcers and carcinomas of the alimentary tube, gastrointestinal radiology became indispensable to physicians and surgeons. Improvements in fluoroscopic and radiographic equipment, the tilting table, the image intensifier with the television train, the introduction of selective visceral angiography with safer contrast media and, more recently, digital subtraction angiography, digital ultrasound (US), color Doppler US, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging--all of these advances have made imaging diagnosis more precise and specific. A new modality--localized tissue MR spectroscopy--should offer an insight into metabolism and suggest optimal modes of treatment and follow-up. The gastrointestinal radiologist of the future will have to be multimodality trained. A new generation of alimentary tract interventional radiologists will further the trend toward less invasive surgical therapy. No end of advances is in sight.
