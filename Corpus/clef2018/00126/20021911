The analysis of the follow-up results for the crural artery bypass. To review the follow-up results of the crural artery bypass.Sixty-five limbs in 64 patients with long stenosis or occlusion in femoral artery and popliteal artery were performed 65 times femoral-crural artery bypass surgery or femoral-popliteal-crural bypass surgery during April 2001 to July 2007. The ankle-brachial index before bypass surgery was 0.35 +/- 0.20 in anterior tibial artery and 0.38 +/- 0.21 in posterior tibial artery. Critical limb ischemia was 93.8%.The ankle-brachial index after bypass surgery was 0.84 +/- 0.26 in anterior tibial artery and 0.83 +/- 0.22 in posterior tibial artery. The perioperative mortality rate was 1.6%, the perioperative amputation rate was 1.5%. Fifty-four patients 54 limbs were followed up. The average follow-up time was (24.1 +/- 16.6) months. The follow-up limb salvage rate was 85.2%. The follow-up mortality rate was 25.9%. Critical limb ischemia decreased as 13.0%. The follow-up ankle-brachial index was difference with before and after bypass surgery as 0.66 +/- 0.26 in anterior tibial artery and 0.64 +/- 0.25 in posterior tibial artery. It was no difference in cumulative limb salvage rate, cumulative primary and secondary patency rate by comparing autogenous vein with composite vascular as graft and comparing femoral-crural artery bypass surgery with femoral-popliteal-crural bypass surgery as surgical method.When the patients are failed in endovascular intervention or have long stenosis or occlusion in femoral artery and popliteal artery to face to amputation, the crural artery bypass is a feasible method. It's helpful to improve the secondary patency rate and limb salvage rate by enhancing the follow-up after operation and early intervention.
