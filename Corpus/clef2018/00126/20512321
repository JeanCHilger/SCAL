Gastrointestinal intervention in children. Interventional radiology is a rapidly growing discipline in paediatrics. Many non-vascular interventional techniques may be used in the gastrointestinal tract in children. The technically simpler and more common of these may be adopted by any paediatric radiologist with an interest in interventional radiology. Other rarer and more complex techniques are currently restricted to specialist centres with a higher overall caseload. This review emphasizes the common procedures such as oesophageal dilatation, gastrostomy, insertion of transgastric jejunal feeding tubes and biopsy. Less common salivary, hepatobiliary, pancreatic and intestinal interventions are also described.
