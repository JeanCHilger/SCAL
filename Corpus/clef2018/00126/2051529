Duplex Doppler sonography in renal parenchymal disease. Histopathologic correlation. To evaluate the histopathologic changes influencing Doppler measurements of the resistive index (RI) in renal arteries in renal parenchymal diseases, 68 kidneys in 34 consecutive patients with various forms of renal parenchymal diseases were studied by duplex Doppler ultrasound (duplex US) immediately before percutaneous renal biopsy. The RI, renal length, and renal cortical echogenicity were correlated with the amount of glomerular, interstitial, and vascular changes graded on a scale from 0 to 100. The renal vascular resistance and therefore the RI are significantly correlated with the prevalence of arteriolosclerosis, glomerular sclerosis, arteriosclerosis, edema, and focal interstitial fibrosis. There was no significant difference of the RI in five groups of different renal parenchymal diseases. Of 34 patients, 24 presented with an RI less than 0.7, which was thought to be within the normal range so far. Additionally, the RI increases as the patient's age increases, due to higher incidence of arteriosclerosis. Of our patients, 44% presented with normal cortical echogenicity. Quantitative duplex US using the RI does not reliably distinguish different types of renal medical disorders.
