Diagnostics and treatment approach for abdominal ischemic syndrome. During 2005-2009 years 150 patients aged between 45-90 years were investigated at the department of general surgery (Rostov medical university) for abdominal ischemic syndrome (AIS). 70 patients were found to have AIS. 4 stages of this syndrome were determined. According to Doppler evaluation of abdominal vessels, an algorithm for the differential treatment approach at various stages of AIS was worked out. The critical level of pathological changes in abdominal vessels and optimal terms for surgical operation were estimated.
