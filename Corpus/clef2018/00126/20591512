Prevalence of high ankle-brachial index (ABI) in general population of Southern Italy, risk factor profiles and systemic cardiovascular co-morbidity: an epidemiological study. Many studies have been carried out to assess the prevalence, risk factors and co-morbidities of peripheral artery disease (PAD). By contrast, to date there is a lack of data on patients with high-ABI. This study aimed at estimating the prevalence of increased ABI (ABI>1.4) and to evaluate the involvement of traditional cardiovascular (CV) risk factors and the atherosclerotic burden (peripheral and carotid arteries) of these patients in a population of Southern Italy. We invited 9647 subjects, age ranging from 30 to 80, by letters to undergo an ABI measurement. Consequently, in patients with ABI>1.4, an ultrasound evaluation of the peripheral and carotid arteries was performed. An ABI>1.4 was found in 260 of 3412 subjects (7.6%). Statistically significant differences were reported in age, diabetes and hypertension, body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC). No differences in sex distribution, dyslipidemia and smoke prevalence were observed. Moreover, 67.9% of ABI>1.4 patients showed a peripheral intima-media thickness (IMT)>0.9 mm at linear regression it was correlated with ABI values
