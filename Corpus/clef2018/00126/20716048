Acute gastric variceal bleeding during orthotopic liver transplant. We present a case of intraoperative gastric variceal bleeding during liver transplant. After an uneventful induction and surgical dissection, our patient developed hemodynamic instability during the anhepatic phase. We believe that an increase in portal pressures, owing to clamping of the portal system, led to spontaneous variceal rupture however, placement of an oral gastric tube or transesophageal echocardiography probe may have contributed to this also. After intraoperative banding, the patient was stabilized and surgery proceeded uneventfully. The patient had no long-term sequelae. Anesthesiologists involved in the care of patients with end-stage liver disease should be aware of this infrequent intraoperative complication and be prepared to treat it appropriately.
