Correlation of color Doppler with multidetector CT angiography findings in carotid artery stenosis. The aim of this paper was to examine the correlation between the Color Doppler ultrasound (CD-US) and multidetector CT angiography (MDCTA) diagnostic methods, and to define the degree and extent of stenosis in patients with internal carotid artery stenosis. This was a cross-sectional study with a consecutive series of patients. All US examinations were always carried out by the same physician-angiologist, while all CT examinations were always carried out by the same physician-radiologist. Both worked independently from each other. The stenosis area was measured at the narrowest point by NASCET criteria for US/CT. Peak systolic velocity (PSV) over 210 cm/sec and end diastolic velocity (EDV) over 110 cm/sec criteria were applied for stenoses with lumen narrowed over 70%, while PSV under 130 cm/sec and EDV under 100 cm/sec criteria were applied for those with lumen narrowed under 70%. A total of 124 carotid arteries were observed namely, 89 narrowed and 68 surgically treated. All patients were reviewed by US and then by MDCTA
