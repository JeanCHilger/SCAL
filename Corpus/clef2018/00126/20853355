Percutaneous revascularization of long femoral artery lesions for claudication: patency over 2.5 years and impact of systematic surveillance. Angioplasty and stenting are preferred treatments for revascularizing femoral artery lesions up to 100 mm, but surgical bypass is recommended for longer lesions. We assessed long-term patency after percutaneous revascularization of long femoral artery lesions for claudication with intensive out-patient surveillance.We followed a cohort of 111 consecutive patients receiving angioplasty or stenting in 142 limbs in two institutions. Patients were followed for 2.5 years, and event curves and multivariable survival analysis used to compare outcomes in three groups according to lesion length (< 100 mm, 100-200 mm, and greater than 200 mm). Failed patency was defined as recurrence of symptoms with a decline in ankle brachial index, or stenosis identified by duplex ultrasound, or reintervention.Compared to lesions less than 100 mm, longer lesions had higher failed primary patency (100-200 mm: HR = 2.0, P = 0.16, >200 mm: HR = 2.6, P = 0.03). Failed secondary patency was similar for short and intermediate lesions (< 5% incidence), but trended higher for lesions >200 mm (HR = 4.2, P = 0.06). An initial procedure residual stenosis greater than 20% was the only significant multivariable factor related to poorer long-term patency (HR = 15.8, P = 0.003). Compared to short lesions, the gain in long-term patency with out-patient surveillance and reintervention was higher for longer lesions and significantly so for intermediate lesions (100-200 mm = 23% versus <100 mm = 8%, P = 0.041).Percutaneous treatment of long femoral artery lesions can provide acceptable long-term patency for patients with claudication when out-patient surveillance is used to identify patients who require repeat interventions. Future long-term studies should consider overall patency encompassing more than one percutaneous reintervention.
