Reduced renal function is associated with combined increases in ventricular-systolic stiffness and arterial load in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization for coronary artery disease. Although mildly reduced renal function is associated with increased risk for heart failure in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), mechanisms underlying the association remain unclear. We tested the hypothesis that abnormal ventricular-arterial interaction may occur in mildly reduced renal function. We examined the relationships of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) with various indices reflecting ventricular-arterial coupling [effective arterial elastance (the ratio of left ventricular (LV) end-systolic pressure to stroke volume, E (a)], LV end-systolic elastance (the ratio of LV end-systolic pressure to end-systolic volume, E (es)), and the total arterial compliance (the ratio of stroke volume to aortic pulse pressure)] and those of LV systolic and diastolic function [peak systolic and diastolic mitral annular velocities (S' and E') and the ratio of peak early diastolic mitral inflow to annular velocity (E/E')] in 320 consecutive patients who underwent cardiac catheterization for CAD and had normal (â‰¥ 0.50) ejection fractions (EF). As eGFR decreased, E (a) and E (es) increased and total arterial compliance and E' decreased. eGFR did not correlate with E (a)/E (es), S', or E/E'. After adjusting for potential confounders, the findings were generally similar, but the correlation of eGFR with E' did not remain significant. In conclusion, reduced renal function may be associated with combined increases in ventricular-systolic stiffness and arterial load in known or suspected CAD patients with normal EF.
