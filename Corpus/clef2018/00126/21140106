Sonographic findings of superior mesenteric artery syndrome causing massive gastric dilatation in a young healthy girl. Acute gastric dilatation due to superior mesenteric artery syndrome in healthy individuals is extremely rare. A 17-year-old girl who complained of epigastric pain for two days following excessive eating was admitted to our hospital. She was nauseated but was unable to vomit. Succussion splash was positive. Bedside ultrasonography revealed a hyperactive duodenum, a distended stomach compressing on the inferior vena cava and a narrowed angle between the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and the aorta. Abdominal computed tomography imaging confirmed the above findings. The angle between the aorta and SMA was only eight degrees. Gastrograffin follow-through showed complete obstruction of the third part of the duodenum. 3,500 ml of fluid was immediately drained through the nasogastric tube. Another gastrograffin study conducted five days later showed normal results. Bedside ultrasonography thus proved to be useful for both the diagnosis and management of superior mesenteric artery syndrome.
