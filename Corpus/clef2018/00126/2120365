Combined use of Doppler and conventional ultrasound for the diagnosis of vascular and other lesions in the head and neck. Twenty-three patients with swellings of the head and neck were prospectively investigated by Doppler ultrasound and ultrasound imaging to determine the type and vascularity of the lesions and thereby aid pre-operative diagnosis. Four vascular lesions were correctly identified while vascularity was not found in patients with lipoma, cysts, abscess, or muscular hypertrophy. Increased vascularity was found in or near some tumours and lymphangiomas, but by careful comparison of findings these lesions were not confused with true vascular lesions. The value of the investigations was demonstrated by a change in the treatment in 6 of the cases in this series.
