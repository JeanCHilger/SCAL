Effect of physical training on leukocyte rheology throughout induced ischaemia. Before and after a physical training programme a treadmill exercise was used to stress leg circulation and induce ischaemia in 20 patients affected by peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD). Transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2) was monitored constantly and blood samples drawn at baseline, the onset of calf pain, the maximum walking time, the minimum TcPO2 value, and when the TcPO2 recovered half its basal value. The mononuclear and polymorphonuclear leucocyte subfractions were separated by density and their filterability rates (through 5 microns pore diameter Nuclepore filters) measured using a positive pressure filtration system. The mononuclear filterability rate was significantly impaired throughout the ischaemic event and inversely correlated with the TcPO2 values. Physical training while delaying the onset and progress of ischaemia did not modify this pattern, implying that regular exercise does not affect the rheological properties of leukocytes--impairments in which are markers of ischaemia.
