Vascular complications after renal transplantation. Vascular complications in renal transplant recipients are uncommon but important causes of graft dysfunction and graft loss after kidney transplantation.To document vascular complications that occurred following kidney transplantations in order to assess the incidence of these complications at our center as well as to identify possible treatment approach.103 kidney transplantations were performed in the period from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2009. All patients after kidney transplantation underwent ultrasound examination (included colour Doppler flow and duplex Doppler ultrasound) immediately after surgery--especially in condition of anuria, then regularly according to an internal schedule and always in patients with worsened graft function.We detected renal vein thrombosis in 3 cases (2.9%), artery thrombosis in 4 cases (3.9%), one time intrarenal pseudoaneurysm (1%) and renal artery stenosis in 10 patients (9.7%). There was no extrarenal pseudoaneurysm or arteriovenous fistula in our group of patients.The incidence of vascular complications in our department correlates with the incidence of these complications referred in literature. We confirmed the importance of established immediate diagnosis and fast intervention once the diagnosis of vascular complication is established (Fig. 8, Ref. 12). Full Text in free PDF www.bmj.sk.
