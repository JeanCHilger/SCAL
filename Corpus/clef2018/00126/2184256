Comparison of selective internal iliac pharmaco-angiography, penile brachial index and duplex sonography with pulsed Doppler analysis for the evaluation of vasculogenic (arteriogenic) impotence. Between July 1987 and February 1988 selective internal iliac angiography was performed before and after intracavernous injection of papaverine plus phentolamine in 43 patients with erectile dysfunction. In 63% of the patients stenosis or occlusion of the pudendal artery was found. The penile brachial index was calculated and duplex sonography with pulsed Doppler analysis was performed in 23 patients. Angiography and penile brachial index correlated in only 39% of the patients, whereas selective internal iliac angiography and duplex sonography correlated in 91% (21 of 23). In 2 patients duplex sonography with pulsed Doppler analysis rendered better information about penile arterial perfusion than did angiography.
