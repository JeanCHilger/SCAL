A novel approach to confirming nasogastric tube placement in the ED. We present a case of 2-dimensional ultrasound-assisted confirmation of nasogastric tube (NGT) placement using both soft tissue neck and epigastric sonographic imaging. Given our findings and review of the literature, we suggest that bedside ultrasound evaluation of NGT placement is a straightforward, rapid, and novel alternative method to the “gold standard” of a portable chest radiograph in the emergency department (ED).
