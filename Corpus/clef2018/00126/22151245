Recurrent cholecystitis in an elderly mentally retarded patient with pica. The case of a 64-year-old patient with pica and severe mental retardation who was admitted to our hospital for treatment of recurrent cholecystitis is reported. Abdominal ultrasound showed sludge in the gallbladder, but no stones. Abdominal CT revealed a foreign body in the duodenum resembling a suction cup of the type commonly used in kitchens and bathrooms. The object could not be removed because it was deeply embedded in the hypertrophic intestinal mucosa. A nasogastric tube was inserted for feeding, since the object impeded the passage of solid foods. The patient's fever and abdominal pain subsequently resolved, and laboratory data improved. The indwelling feeding tube prevented recurrence of cholecystitis. Since pica is common not only in patients with mental retardation but also in dementia patients, the present case may also relate to the treatment of acute abdominal conditions in dementia patients.
