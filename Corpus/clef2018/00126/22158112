A comparison between central blood pressure values obtained by the Gaon system and the SphygmoCor system. Central pulse pressure is correlated with carotid atherosclerosis and the incidence of cardiovascular events more significantly than brachial pulse pressure. Augmentation index (Aix) has been shown to be an independent predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Pulse wave analysis using the Gaon system allows for the estimation of central blood pressure (CBP), corrected augmentation index (Aix@HR75), ejection duration (ED) and subendocardial viability ratio (SEVR), and is widely used in clinical research in Korea. However, the accuracy of this system is controversial. From February 2008 to March 2011, 99 patients were recruited for this study. Measurements were taken both by the Gaon system and the SphygmoCor system on the same day for all study participants. The estimated values of CBP, Aix@HR75, ED and SEVR for the two systems were compared using paired t-tests, simple correlation analyses and Bland-Altman plots. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) estimated by the two systems was significantly (P<0.001) correlated the coefficient was 0.982. The two s.d. of the difference in SBP between these systems was quite small--<7 mm Hg. Aix@HR75, ED and SEVR as estimated by the two systems were also significantly correlated, although they, especially SEVR, showed much weaker correlations than were observed in SBP: coefficients for Aix@HR75, ED and SEVR were 0.727, 0.648 and 0.230, respectively. We assessed the CBP of Korean patients estimated by the two systems and observed that the correlations of Aix, ED and SEVR were weaker than that of CBP. Such variations may be due to the difference in measuring methods between the devices. As even a slight change in pulse waveforms may result in a large difference in estimations, parameters, including Aix@HR75, ED and SEVR, should be carefully interpreted by experienced clinicians.
