Classification and clinical impact of restenosis after femoropopliteal stenting. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between angiographic patterns of in-stent restenosis (ISR) after femoropopliteal (FP) stenting and the frequency of refractory ISR.In-stent restenosis after FP stenting is an unsolved problem. The incidence and predictors of refractory restenosis remain unclear.This study was a multicenter, retrospective observational study. From September 2000 to December 2009, 133 restenotic lesions after FP artery stenting were classified by angiographic pattern: class I included focal lesions (≤50 mm in length), class II included diffuse lesions (>50 mm in length), and class III included totally occluded ISR. All patients were treated by balloon angioplasty for at least 60 s. Recurrent ISR or occlusion was defined as ISR or occlusion after target lesion revascularization. Restenosis was defined as >2.4 of the peak systolic velocity ratio by duplex scan or >50% stenosis by angiography.Sixty-four percent of patients were male, 67% had diabetes mellitus, and 24% underwent hemodialysis. Class I pattern was found in 29% of the limbs, class II in 38%, and class III in 33%. Mean follow-up period was 24 ± 17 months. All-cause death occurred in 14 patients bypass surgery was performed in 11 limbs, and major amputation was performed in 1 limb during the follow-up. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that the rate of recurrent ISR at 2 years was 84.8% in class III patients compared with 49.9% in class I patients (p < 0.0001) and 53.3% in class II patients (p = 0.0003), and the rate of recurrent occlusion at 2 years was 64.6% in class III patients compared with 15.9% in class I patients (p < 0.0001) and 18.9% in class II patients (p < 0.0001).Restenotic patterns after FP stenting are important predictors of recurrent ISR and occlusion.
