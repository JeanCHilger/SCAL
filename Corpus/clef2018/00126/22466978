Ankle-brachial index in a type 2 diabetic population with proliferative retinopathy: associated risk factors and complications. The aim of this study was to analyse risk factors and complications associated with low ankle-brachial index (ABI) in a type 2 diabetic population with proliferative retinopathy.This study included 181 subjects. ABI was measured with a Doppler device. Subjects with ABI <0.9 were diagnosed with peripheral vascular disease (PVD). The exclusion criterion was medial arterial calcification.The mean (± SD) age and diabetes (DM) duration were 65±9.7 years and 18.6±9.1 years, respectively. ABI <0.9 was associated with increasing age (P<0.001), DM duration (P=0.02), higher total (P=0.02) and LDL cholesterol (P=0.035), higher ESR (P=0.04), uric acid (P=0.004) vibration perception thresholds (VPT), and lower eGFR (P<0.001). BMI (P<0.001), waist index (P=0.01), FPG (P=0.013), HbA1c (P=0.005) and ALT (P<0.001) were significantly lower in patients with PVD. Multivariate analysis revealed age (P=0.04), high total cholesterol (P=0.038), low BMI (P=0.017), low VPT (P=0 031) and declining eGFR (p=0.006) to be independent predictors of PVD.Increasing age, total cholesterol levels, and VPT, together with declining renal function and lower BMI are independent predictors of PVD in a type 2 diabetic population with advanced microvascular disease. Knowledge of risk factors will help target preventive measures and treatment to subjects most susceptible to PVD.
