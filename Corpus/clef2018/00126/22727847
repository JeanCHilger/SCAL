Micro-lightguide spectrophotometry for tissue perfusion in ischemic limbs. To validate micro-lightguide spectrophotometry (O2C) in patients with lower limb ischemia and to compare results with those obtained from toe blood pressure.We prospectively examined 59 patients, 24 of whom complained of claudication, 31 had critical ischemia, and four were asymptomatic. Diabetes was present in 19 (32%) patients. Saturation (SO(2)) and flow measured with O2C were determined with the limb in the horizontal position followed by a 55-cm elevation. Toe pressures were determined in the horizontal position only. In addition, 13 patients were examined before and, on average, 3 days after revascularization.Median SO(2) was 62% (25%-75% percentile: 37%-75%) with the limb in the horizontal position and 16% (3%-41%) with the limb elevated. Comparing the individual toe pressures with SO(2) values measured in the horizontal position and elevated position revealed a significant correlation (r(s) = 0.40 P < .01 and r(s) = 0.56O2C was easy to use, fast, and painless. The most useful finding was the high predictive value of a low saturation and the rise in O2C values after successful revascularization.
