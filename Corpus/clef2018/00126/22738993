Costs of secondary prevention of stroke by carotid endarterectomy. We estimated the costs to the Danish National Health Service of preventing stroke due to carotid artery stenosis by carotid endarterectomy (CEA), including costs of identifying patients, Doppler ultrasound (DUS) examination and CEA.Estimations are based on patients with stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIA) or amaurosis fugax referred for carotid DUS in the municipality of Frederiksberg, Denmark (127,184 residents), within an 18-month period in 2008-2009.In total, 372 patients with stroke (n = 194), TIA (n = 157) or amaurosis fugax (n = 21) were referred for DUS. We identified 12 patients with 50-70% stenosis and 20 patients with >70% stenosis. Six had CEA, all of whom had stenosis >70%. Waiting time from symptom to CEA was a median of 38 days. Costs of preventing 1 recurrent stroke in the study period [number needed to treat (NNT) = 13] was in the range of EUR 207,675-333,918. If CEA had been performed within 2 weeks after onset of symptoms (NNT = 4), costs would be in the range of EUR 63,900-102,744.Costs of preventing stroke by CEA were high. Substantial reductions of costs (by about 2/3) can be achieved if CEA is performed <2 weeks after the ischemic event.
