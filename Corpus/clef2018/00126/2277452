Utility of peak systolic pressure/left ventricular end-systolic volume (PSP/LVESV) ratio in diagnosis of coronary artery disease--assessment by radionuclide ventriculography. To evaluate the accuracy of PSP/LVESV as a detector of coronary artery disease, exercise radionuclide ventriculography was performed. In 26 patients with angina pectoris, the changes of LVEF, LVESV and PSP/LVESV were more sensitive for the detection of exercise-induced ischemia than the appearance of chest pain and the changes of ECG. In 112 patients with coronary artery disease and 55 subjects without coronary artery disease, the sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of the change of PSP/LVESV were 96%, 98% and 96%, respectively. In present study, the sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy of EF and LVESV were 96%, 91% and 95%, and 95%, 93% and 94%, respectively. Although the change of PSP/LVESV was considered to be the most usefull parameter, we can not detect the exercise-induced ischemia by these three global parameters in patients with coronary artery branch stenosis. In conclusion, diagnosis of coronary artery disease using radionuclide ventriculography should be performed using not only global LV parameters but also the regional indexes, such as regional wall motion, regional EF and other parameters.
