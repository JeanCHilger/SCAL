The postoperative radiological features of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Obesity is rapidly becoming one of the major challenges for health care systems. Surgery has proved to be one of the most effective methods of helping patients to achieve sustainable weight loss. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is a relatively new bariatric surgical technique. A staple line is placed in a line parallel to the lesser curve of the stomach, excluding up to 85% of the volume of the stomach. The excluded stomach is then resected leaving a 'tube' of residual stomach. Radiologists may be asked to perform and interpret imaging studies in the postoperative period and should be familiar with the normal appearances and common complications. Postoperative radiological investigations will typically be for suspected leak or obstruction. A water soluble contrast upper gastrointestinal (UGI) series should be performed in both suspected leak and obstruction if the patient is conscious and able to swallow. A normal postoperative UGI series will show free flow of contrast into the gastric remnant, which will be tubular with no spillage of contrast beyond the staple line, which is located on the caudal aspect of the gastric remnant. Stenosis or obstruction of the stomach may occur if the stomach remnant is too tight or torsion of the stomach. Stenosis is usually treated endoscopically with dilation and torsion is treated surgically. Leaks are often treated with covered stents which may be placed with endoscopic or radiological guidance. Collections may be drained under fluoroscopic, ultrasound or computed tomography guidance.
