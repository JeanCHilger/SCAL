Hybrid operations in multilevel lesions of lower-limb arteries. Reflected in the article is experience in treating a total of 24 patients suffering from lower limb chronic ischaemia and diagnosed as having concomitant lesions of the aortofemoral and femoropopliteal segments, with a total of 24 hybrid operations performed. Of these, nineteen interventions consisted of implanting a stent graft into iliac arteries and revascularization of the femoropopliteal segment, whereas the remaining five cases included balloon angioplasty of the iliac artery with revascularization of the femoropopliteal segment. Good immediate outcomes were obtained in 23 patients. The ankle-brachial index increased averagely from 0.38 to 0.88. The remote outcomes (from 12 months to 5 years) were followed up in fifteen patients. Cumulative patency of the bypass grafts after 1, 3 and 5 years amounted to 78%, 41.5% and 41.5%, respectively. The cumulative survival rates after 1, 3 and 5 years equalled 90.8%, 76.2% and 76.2%, respectively. All extremities were eventually spared, with the long-term limb salvage rate thus amounting to 100%.
