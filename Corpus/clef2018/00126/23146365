Prevalence of unrecognized lower extremity peripheral arterial disease and the associated factors in chinese hypertensive adults. We aimed to examine the prevalence of lower-extremity peripheral artery disease (LE-PAD) and its associated factors in 3,128 Chinese hypertensive adults 45 to 75 years old without known cardiovascular disease, PAD, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. A cross-sectional investigation was carried out in a rural area of Lianyungang, China. An ankle-brachial index ≤0.90 in either leg was used to define LE-PAD. Prevalence of LE-PAD was 9.0% (10.0% in women and 7.4% in men). In the multivariable logistic regression model, odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of having LE-PAD, were 1.82 (1.27 to 2.61) for participants 65 to 75 versus 45 to 55 years old, 1.48 (1.00 to 1.20) for participants with a waist circumference ≥90 versus <90 cm, 1.47 (1.05 to 2.04) and 1.62 (1.15 to 2.27) for participants with grade 2 and 3 hypertension versus controlled blood pressure or grade 1 hypertension, 1.35 (1.00 to 1.83) and 1.61 (1.16 to 2.23) for participants with heart rate at rest 70 to 80 and ≥80 versus <70 beats/min, and 1.41 (1.00 to 1.97) for participants with poor versus good sleeping quality. For other risk factors, gender-related differences were observed. Adjusted odds ratios of having LE-PAD for men and women were 1.07 (0.66 to 1.74) and 0.65 (0.47 to 0.90) for inland versus coastal residents and 1.03 (0.57 to 1.86) and 1.62 (1.09 to 2.41) for participants with body mass index ≥25 versus <25 kg/m(2). In conclusion, there was a high prevalence of LE-PAD in Chinese hypertensive adults without known cardiovascular disease, PAD, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, particularly in women in coastal areas and in participants with higher heart rate and poor sleeping quality. Therefore, ankle-brachial index determinations should be encouraged in clinical practice in Chinese hypertensive adults.
