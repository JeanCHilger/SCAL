Neurologic syndromes affecting the shoulder (author's transl). A number of locally defined as well as generalised diseases of the peripheral nervous system is manifested in the shoulderarm region besides lesions of individual nerves through traumas or as a result of pressure. Radicular syndromes are particularly frequent. These are based on prolapsed disks or degenerative changes of the cervical vertebral column. We must differentiate between these syndromes and the often rather unknown neuralgic amytrophy of the shoulder. Our experience has shown that in too many cases, paralysis of the plexus cervico-brachialis is assumed, although this occurs almost exclusively on the basis of traumatic violence, much rarer due to pressure. In such cases, the physician should look for the scalenus syndrome, the costoclavicular syndrome, and the hyperabduction syndrome. As a rule, pain is the most prominent symptom in plexus pareses through new growths, eg Pancoast's tumour. In such cases, a clear distinction must be made against bursitis of the shoulder (periarthritis humeroscapularis), in which there are no neurogenic changes, but only myogenic changes manifested in the electromyogram. If the sudden pain is accompanied by swelling and weakness of the arm, there is every likelihood of the existence of Paget-von Schr√∂tter's syndrome. A remarkably painless deformation of the shoulder joint should also suggest neurogenic arthropathy in syringomyelia. The physician should also consider disturbances of distant origin, for example in the region of the carpal tunnel, with pain radiating to the shoulder in the manner of brachialgia paraesthetica. Finally, any noticeable weakness or muscular atrophy in the shoulder region should suggest a disease of the neuromuscular system, mainly progressive muscular dystrophy or the rare shoulder girdle type of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
