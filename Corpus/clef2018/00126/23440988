A microscopically calcified Meckel's diverticulum: a histopathological perspective of a case of both gastric and pancreatic mucosae. A 2-year-old child presented with a 1-week history of abdominal pain and non-bilious vomiting. Upon examination, the abdomen was distended and faecal aspirate was noted from a nasogastric tube. Ultrasound scan and a failed air enema demonstrated intestinal intussusception warranting a surgical intervention. The intraoperative findings were of an ileocolic intussusception that was reduced and a Meckel's diverticulum (MD) was noted as a lead point necessitating resection with an end-to-end anastomosis. Histopathological analysis revealed a heterotopic MD containing both gastric and pancreatic mucosae with dystrophic calcification. MD is a pathologically diverse condition. The commonest histopathological picture in MD is that of an ectopic gastric mucosa at the terminal ileum. The histopathological analysis of this case demonstrated the interesting heterotopic results with calcification, which the histopathologist needs to be aware of when interpreting a surgical specimen with a clinical picture consistent with intussusception.
