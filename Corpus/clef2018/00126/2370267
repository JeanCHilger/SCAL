Predictors of surgical outcome in patients undergoing aortobifemoral bypass reconstruction. We report a prospective study with 2 years of follow-up including 105 consecutive symptomatic patients (58.1% claudication and 41.9% severe ischemia) undergoing aortobifemoral bypass surgery (ABF/BP). Proportional-hazards, stepwise regression, and life-table analyses were used to determine predictors of the following outcome criteria: graft patency, amputation, mortality, symptomatic recurrence, and palliation. The operative mortality was 5.7% and the 2-year cumulative mortality was 15.5%. Most deaths (61.5%) were cardiac-related. There were 3 predictors of mortality: the presence of more than 1 surgical risk factor (relative risk [RR] 6.2 p less than 0.001), advanced age (RR 2.9
