Jejuno-jejunal intussusception: an unusual complication of feeding jejunostomy. The jejuno-jejunal intussusception is a rare complication of jejunostomy tube placement. We are reporting a case of 33-year-old man who was suffering from absolute dysphagia due to carcinoma of cricopharynx with advanced metastatic disease, who underwent Stamms feeding jejunostomy as a part of palliative care. After 1 month he presented with colicky type of pain in the abdomen and vomiting. Sonogram of abdomen revealed a target sign and a feeding tube in a dilated jejunum. Abdominal CT proved the sonographic impression of jejuno-jejunal intussusception. He, therefore, underwent exploratory laparotomy and resection and anastomosis of the intussuscepted bowel. New feeding jejunostomy (FJ) was done distally from the anastomotic site. As per the literature this complication has been reported in Witzels jejunostomy. In our case the patient had undergone Stamms jejunostomy with placement of a Ryle's tube. Intussusception should be considered if a patient comes with abdominal pain and vomiting following FJ.
