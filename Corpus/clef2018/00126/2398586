Significance and management of inflow gradients unexpectedly generated after femorofemoral, femoropopliteal, and femoroinfrapopliteal bypass grafting. With multilevel arteriosclerosis, some patients undergoing infrainguinal bypass grafting will develop femoral/brachial pressure gradients only after the bypass is performed. We therefore evaluated arteriographically alternate inflow sites and measured the femoral/brachial pressure gradients before and after placement of 87 femorofemoral and 510 femoropopliteal/infrapopliteal bypasses. No prebypass femoral/brachial pressure gradients were present with and without intraarterial papaverine. However, femoral/branchial pressure gradients greater than or equal to 15 mm Hg were observed after the bypass placement in 16 femorofemoral patients and 43 femoropopliteal/infrapopliteal patients. Gradients averaged 28 +/- 8 (SD) (range, 15 to 50) mm Hg. The post femorofemoral bypass gradients were treated by immediate supplementary inflow extension to the aorta (three patients) or an axillary artery (three patients) by postoperative iliac percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (four patients) or by no treatment (six patients with femoral/brachial pressure gradients of 15 to 35 [23 +/- 5] mm Hg). The 43 postfemoropopliteal/infrapopliteal bypass gradients were treated by immediate supplementary inflow extension to the contralateral femoral artery (15 patients), the aorta (8 patients), or an axillary artery (3 patients)
