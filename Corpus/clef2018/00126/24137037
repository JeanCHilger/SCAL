Intussusception in children presenting to the emergency department. A retrospective chart review of children diagnosed with intussusceptions from March 2005 to March 2007 was conducted at a tertiary care pediatric hospital. There were 152 children with 170 episodes of intussusceptions during the study period. Around one third (30%) of children diagnosed with intussusceptions had a concurrent infection. There were 114 large bowel intussusceptions, with a mean age of 27 months (SD = 25) and a success rate of 91% for air enema reductions. Bowel resection was performed in 8.8% of children with large bowel intussusceptions. Small bowel intussusceptions (n = 38) were associated with gastrostomy tubes in 42% (n = 16) of patients, and 81% needed tube shortening. The varying age range of many children diagnosed with intussusceptions and the high incidence of intercurrent illnesses and fever in our study alert health professionals to suspect intussusceptions in children presenting with abdominal pain or crying.
