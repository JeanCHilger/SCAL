Gastric tuberculosis presenting with a huge abdominal mass. Tuberculosis of the stomach is extremely rare. We report the case of a 38-year-old woman who presented with epigastric discomfort and a palpable mass that persisted for a period of one month. We also report our findings from the abdominal computed tomographic, upper endoscopic and endoscopic ultrasonographic examinations of the patient. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed the presence of a large mass with an irregularly contoured low attenuation lesion. Upper endoscopy and endoscopic ultrasonography revealed a protruding ulcerative mass with an ill-defined heteroechoic subepithelial lesion originating from the gastric submucosal layer. This was previously misdiagnosed as a gastrointestinal stromal tumour. Endoscopic biopsy specimen was positive on acid-fast bacillus staining, and polymerase chain reaction for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was also positive. Abdominal CT and endoscopy at the patient's three-month follow-up showed near complete resolution of the lesion.
