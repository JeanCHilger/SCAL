Hiatal hernia causing extrapericardial tamponade after coronary bypass surgery. Cardiac tamponade is defined as compression of the heart due to accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac, leading to raised pericardial pressures with haemodynamic compromise. We describe the case of a 76-year old female patient who underwent a routine off-pump coronary artery bypass graft operation and within 48 h developed classic signs of cardiac tamponade. The perioperative echocardiogram and operative findings at re-exploration revealed no clots or fluid collection. A giant hiatus hernia was found to be responsible for the tamponade through extrinsic compression. After insertion of a nasogastric tube and decompression of the stomach, there was a rapid improvement of the clinical picture. The remaining postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged 5 days later, with referral to the general surgeon for further management. We conclude that, in cases of tamponade post-cardiac surgery, extrapericardial pathologies should be considered.
