The development of pyloric stenosis during transpyloric feedings. Three infants, ages 3 to 4 months, had nasojejunal feeding tubes placed for recurrent aspiration and/or feeding intolerance after upper gastrointestinal cineradiographs (ugi) had documented gastroesophageal reflux (GER) with normal pyloric channels and prompt gastric emptying. The tubes had been in place for 3 and 4 weeks, respectively, in the first two infants when classic hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS) was found during fundoplication and gastrostomy tube placement. The last child had a failed attempt at nasogastric tube feedings following 3 months of nasojejunal tube feedings. A repeat ugi suggested HPS, which was confirmed by pyloric ultrasound. This infant underwent pyloromyotomy alone. The late presentation of HPS in these infants suggests that transpyloric tubes might cause the development of HPS and exacerbate the symptoms of preexisting GER. In infants who are expected to eat by mouth, pyloromyotomy alone might allow the reinstitution of orogastric feedings without the perioperative morbidity of fundoplication and gastrostomy tube placement.
