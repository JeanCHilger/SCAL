Peripheral percutaneous transluminal laser angioplasty in humans: in vitro investigations and clinical results with a novel laser catheter system. Percutaneous transluminal laser angioplasty has become an accepted method of treatment of peripheral arterial occlusive disease. To minimize the risk of arterial wall perforation during laser angioplasty, a novel laser catheter system was developed. In 113 obliterated postmortem human arteries the perforation rate was 0.9%. The mean degree of stenosis was reduced from 89 +/- 9% before, to 53 +/- 11% after laser irradiation. Clinical Nd:YAG laser angioplasty was performed in 19 patients suffering from peripheral arterial occlusive disease. The Fontaine stage improved in 16 patients in no case did it deteriorate. The mean degree of stenosis was reduced by laser angioplasty from 91 +/- 12% to 31 +/- 19%. A further reduction down to 13 +/- 18% was achieved by subsequent percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty. The systolic Doppler ankle-arm pressure gradient was improved from 0.58 +/- 0.26 to 0.89 +/- 0.25. In 7 patients microembolisms were detectable on the final angiogram. There was no acute reocclusion and no perforation. Within a follow-up period of 12 months, four restenoses were diagnosed by digital subtraction angiography. On average, the Doppler index was 0.75 +/- 0.32.
