Muscle enzyme adaptation in patients with peripheral arterial insufficiency: spontaneous adaptation, effect of different treatments and consequences on walking performance. 1. The activities of phosphofructokinase (PFK), citrate synthetase (CS), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACDH) and cytochrome-c oxidase(Cyt-ox) in the calf muscle tissue were compared in subjects with intermittent claudication (n = 38) and controls (n = 20). The activities of CS, ACDH and Cyt-ox were increased and the activity of Cytox was positively correlated to the maximal walking distance (MWD) in the patients. 2. Thirty-three patients with intermittent claudication were randomized to three treatment groups: (1) operative surgery, (2) operative surgery supplemented with physical training and (3) physical training alone. Before and after 6-12 months of treatment, symptom-free walking distance (SFWD), MWD, ankle-brachial blood pressure quotient (ankle index), maximal plethysmographic calf blood flow (MPBF) and the activities of PFK, CS, LDH, ACDH and Cyt-ox were measured. 3. SFWD and MWD increased in all three groups. Ankle index and MPBF increased in groups 1 and 2, but were unchanged in group 3. The activities of Cyt-ox and CS decreased with operation, but the activity of Cyt-ox was further augmented with training in group 3. Overall, the change in ankle index explained 80-90% of the variability in walking performance. In a separate analysis, the increased activity of Cyt-ox in group 3 was positively correlated to, and explained 31% of the variability in, the improvement in SFWD. 4. These findings indicate that both physical activity and a reduced calf blood flow are necessary conditions for the enzymatic adaptation to take place. A causal relationship between metabolic adaptation in the muscle tissue and walking performance is suggested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
