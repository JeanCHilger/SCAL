The arterial pulse analyzer as a potential replacement for manual pulse palpation in Oriental medicine. Application of the arterial pulse analyzer now makes it possible to automatically diagnose such geriatric disorders as arteriosclerosis by using simple electrocardiograms and radial, carotid and posterior tibial artery pressure pulse wave charts. If the arterial pulse analyzer is adopted for use in Oriental medical clinics, there will no longer be a need for manual pulse palpation. In brief, applying the arterial pulse analyzer to the 8 key pulses of Oriental medicine yields the following results: 1) 'Slow' or 'rapid' pulses can be defined by the S-S interval (almost identical to the R-R interval of the ECG). 2) 'Slippery' or 'hesitant' pulses can be defined by the S-P time and the Dh/Ch% (P time & Incisura) ratio. 3) 'Floating' or 'submerged' pulses can be defined by the Ph/Ch% (pressure pulse wave to height) ratio. 4) 'Scattered' or 'moderate' pulses can be defined by the S-C- time (E time). Thus, by employing the arterial pulse analyzer, subjectivity problems inherent in the manual pulse palpation used by Oriental medicine for over 1500 years can be analyzed objectively.
