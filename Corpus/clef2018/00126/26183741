Clear cell sarcoma of the esophagus: report of a case. We report a rare case of clear cell sarcoma of the esophagus and review the literature regarding clear cell sarcomas of the gastrointestinal tract. A 57-year-old male was admitted with dysphagia during swallowing. Preoperative imaging studies, including upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and endoscopic ultrasonography, showed that the tumor was located between the mucosa and the muscularis propria of the lower esophagus. We performed subtotal esophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction. Pathological findings of the tumor showed mixed spindle cells and oval cells. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the tumor cells were positive for S-100, vimentin and neuron-specific enolase and negative for Î±-smooth muscle actin, myoglobin and c-kit. Fluorescence in situ hybridization using a Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 probe showed split signals in a small percentage of cells. We finally diagnosed the patient with clear cell sarcoma of the esophagus.
