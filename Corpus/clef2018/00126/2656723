Estimation of amputation level with a laser Doppler flowmeter. Leg amputation levels were decided in 24 patients suffering from atherosclerosis, using the conventional techniques of segmental blood pressure and radioisotope skin clearance. The skin microcirculation was measured and recorded before operation with a laser doppler flowmeter. A high correlation was found between the successful amputation levels and the maximal blood perfusion of the skin measured in this way.
