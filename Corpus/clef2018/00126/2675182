Iatrogenic changes at the venotomy site after percutaneous placement of the Greenfield filter. To determine the prevalence of iatrogenic abnormalities associated with percutaneous delivery of Greenfield filters, the authors prospectively evaluated 69 peripheral veins used for filter placement in 68 patients. Of the 69 venotomy sites, 63 were not associated with preexisting thrombosis and were evaluated with compression and Doppler ultrasound within 1 week of placement and over 13-541 days. New thrombosis developed at the puncture site in nine of 63 sites (14.3%), although clinical suspicion of clot was raised in only one patient. Fifty-four sites (85.7%) showed no evidence of acute deep venous thrombosis, even though three patients had signs and symptoms suggestive of thrombosis. During the follow-up, most new thromboses resolved, yielding a 96.3% long-term patency rate. The authors conclude that postplacement increase in symptoms of venous stasis and occlusion may not correlate with placement site thrombosis. New filters should be evaluated for their ability to capture potential pulmonary emboli while maintaining caval patency and for mechanical and biologic stability because placement site complications occur at low rates and resolve in most cases.
