Diagnostic use of laser Doppler flowmetry in patients with circulatory insufficiency. Laser Doppler Flowmetry (LDF) is a method for continuous quantification of microvascular perfusion. The article briefly presents the principle of the method, and reviews the literature dealing with diagnostic use of LDF in patients with insufficient extremity circulation. The location and degree of vascular lesions can be evaluated, and non-invasive evaluation of peripheral vascular resistance performed in the vascular laboratory. Prospective human studies are needed before the clinical value of the method can be assessed.
