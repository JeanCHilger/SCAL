Diagnostic strategy in diseases of the small intestine. For the most frequent and important indications for radiologic examination of the small bowel (passage disorder, blood of unknown origin, inflammatory processes, malabsorption) a diagnostic strategy was established. From the contrast investigations the imaging of the small bowel with a tube, enteroclysma, is preferred. The significance of plain films and sonography is also pointed out. Computed tomography and angiography are rarely indicated. The recommendation of enteroclysma is substantiated by the evaluation of our own series of investigations.
