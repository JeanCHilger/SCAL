Color-coded Doppler sonography of the carotid arteries. Doppler colour flow imaging provides colour-coded visualisation of blood flow additional to the B-mode image. In this study, the carotid arteries of 92 patients were examined comparing duplex sonography with Doppler colour flow imaging. Efficiency of these methods was evaluated by angiography in 16 patients. Examination time was shorter by using Doppler colour flow imaging evaluation of haemodynamics and anatomical changes was simplified.
