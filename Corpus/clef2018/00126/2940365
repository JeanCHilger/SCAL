Comparative study of external methods (Doppler, rheography, flow using Xe) and arteriography of the legs, in the evaluation of stenoses. Statistical evaluation by the Kappa test. On a thirty five homogeneous group of arteriosclerotic patients, the authors study by means of the Kappa test the validity of arteriographic and non invasive techniques data interpretation by two trained observers. Then they compared between the conclusion of these methods again with Kappa test. The viability of arteriographic and Doppler interpretation is good. The comparison between arteriographic and external techniques results needs strong reduction of the arteriographic data in large classifications. Doppler (with distal pressure) is the best of non invasive techniques, the others staying less selective. The good correlation between arteriography and doppler data observed in main arteries is maximum for femoral arteries and decreases in distal arteries mainly because of a poor filling due to proximal lesions.
