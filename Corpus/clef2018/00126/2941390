Doppler velocimetry: first choice diagnostic procedure in angiology. The experience with 1916 Doppler ultrasound examinations carried out on peripheral vascular districts and supra-aortic trunks is reported. It is underlined that Doppler velocimetry is a reliable, specific and non-invasive technique and therefore it should be considered a first choice examination particularly useful in the study of the development of vascular diseases in the different districts and in the postoperative follow-up.
