Assessment of small-bowel ischemia by laser Doppler flowmetry. Some case reports. Laser Doppler flowmetry was used for intraoperative assessment of intestinal blood flow in five patients with small-bowel ischemia. In two patients with mechanically caused ischemia, bowel resection could be limited or avoided after flowmeter recordings. In two patients with mesenteric vascular occlusion, the flowmeter recording confirmed the macroscopic impression of irreversible gangrene. In a third subject with mesenteric vascular occlusion the extent of severe ischemia was clinically underestimated compared with the results obtained with the laser Doppler flowmeter. We conclude that, with further experience and development, laser Doppler flowmetry has great potential as a useful method for objective intraoperative assessment of blood flow in patients with small-bowel ischemia of various origins.
