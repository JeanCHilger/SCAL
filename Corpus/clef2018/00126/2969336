Partitional measurement of capillary and arteriovenous anastomotic blood flow in the human finger by laser-Doppler-flowmeter. This study was made to see whether changes in blood flow through the capillaries and arteriovenous anastomoses (AVA's) of the human finger can be measured by noninvasive flowmetry. Total finger blood flow (FBF) was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography blood flow was measured by a laser-Doppler flowmeter (ADVANCE, ALF-2100, Tokyo, Japan) using probes with optic fiber separations of 0.3 mm (LDF-0.3) and 0.7 mm (LDF-0.7). The maximum sensitivities for LDF-0.3 and LDF-0.7 were at depths of 0.8 and 1.2 mm from the tissue surface respectively. Two series of experiments were performed on separate days. In the first series the test hand was immersed in a water bath whose temperature (Tw) was 25 degrees C at an ambient temperature (Ta) of 25 degrees C. Tw was raised to 35 degrees C (local hand warming), which was then followed by an increase in Ta to 35 degrees C (whole body warming). FBF, LDF-0.3, and LDF-0.7 increased during these thermal stimulations. However, the relationship of FBF to LDF-0.3 showed two different regression lines. In contrast, the relationship of FBF to LDF-0.7 showed a single regression line. In the second series, with Ta at 35 degrees C, the test hand was immersed in a water bath at Tw 35 degrees C. Tw was then raised every 10 min by 2 degrees C steps from 35 to 41 degrees C. At Tw 39-41 degrees C, FBF and LDF-0.7 in the test hand were significantly decreased compared with those at Tw 35 degrees C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
