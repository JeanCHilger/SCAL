Acute renal infarction: diagnosis by Doppler ultrasound. A young infant undergoing balloon angioplasty for pulmonic stenosis developed global right renal infarction as a complication of cardiac catheterization via the femoral vein. A second patient developed segmental infarction of a recently transplanted kidney due to occlusion of a polar artery. Although routine renal sonography of these patients was normal, duplex Doppler sonography documented the absence of renal arterial and venous flow.
