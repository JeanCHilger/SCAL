Percutaneous nonendoscopic gastrostomy in children. Surgical gastrostomy has long been a standard method of providing nutrition to infants and children. Recently, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy has been advocated as a safer, quicker, less expensive method in children. We report our experience with 16 percutaneous gastrostomies in 14 infants and children in all cases, both sonographic and fluoroscopic guidance were used. Four patients had had previous surgical gastrostomy in which the tubes could not be replaced once they were removed. The remaining patients were referred for percutaneous placement of gastrostomy tubes as the first procedure. In 13 procedures, parenteral sedation and local anesthesia were used
