Anatomic and functional diagnosis in arterial occlusive disease. Arteriosclerosis is the most common cause of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) it begins in the second and third decades of life but first becomes manifest, however, many years later. The hemodynamic effects of arterial narrowing in the peripheral arteries are dependent on functional and morphological adaption, temporal and topographical factors and the prevailing metabolism. In the large arteries of the legs, luminal narrowing of more than 70% is required to render impairment of normal exercise capacity such that it can be assumed that even substantial vascular changes may not be associated with clinical symptoms. An acute peripheral vascular occlusion is regarded as a medical emergency. The most frequent cause is in-situ thrombosis or embolism
