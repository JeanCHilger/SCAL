Noninvasive diagnostic techniques in vascular disease. In order to evaluate the degree of arterial insufficiency, measurement of blood pressure, blood flow, flow velocity and waveform has been the focus of noninvasive diagnostic techniques. Noninvasive estimation of the degree of venous reflux has been an important problem, in place of invasive measurement of venous pressure. Although vascular imaging provides excellent informations about occlusive and aneurysmal lesions, a problem awaiting solution is a hemodynamic visualization of blood flow and physiological phenomenon.
