Intersubclavian bypass. Technic. Indications. Remote results. Between 1974 and 1984, 34 patients were treated by inter-subclavian bypass operation for occlusive lesions of proximal subclavian artery or brachiocephalic trunk. Patients treated in this way were those in whom other methods were inapplicable. Results showed it to be a valid procedure: absence of morbidity or mortality related to the operation itself (one postoperative death from myocardial infarction) excellent early and late permeability if the need for absence of parietal or stenosing lesions in the arteries of origin and supply is respected. Doppler ultrasound imaging showed satisfactory hemodynamic results.
