Percutaneous gastro-enterostomy. Percutaneous gastrostomies or gastroenterostomies serve for temporary or permanent enteric feeding in patients with obstruction or functional derangement of the esophagus or hypopharynx. In addition, this radiological procedure may be indicated for small bowel decompression. The authors present their experience in 71 patients. Insufflation of air through a nasogastric tube or catheter is the preferred method for gastric distension. The inferior margin of the left lobe of the liver and the transverse colon are localized sonographically and fluoroscopically prior to puncture. Either Seldinger or Trocar-techniques have proven effective in establishing access to the stomach. The feeding tube is advanced into the proximal jejunum to reduce the likelihood of gastroesophageal reflux and possible aspiration. Complications were encountered in four patients and included catheter dislocation in three and respiratory distress in one patient.
