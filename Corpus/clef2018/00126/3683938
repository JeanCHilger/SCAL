Femoral artery pressure criteria in the assessment of the aorto-iliac segment obtained by means of a receiver operator characteristic curve analysis. The hemodynamic importance of aorto-iliac arteriosclerotic obstructive disease is hard to assess when multiple level lesions are present. Therefore, direct blood pressure measurement in the femoral artery during increased blood flow is a promising technique. Criteria for aorto-iliac disease could be defined by means of a retrospective study in which preoperative blood pressure parameters were compared with the results of arterial reconstruction. These criteria were then prospectively assessed as to their value in the diagnosis of hemodynamically significant aorto-iliac disease. As in the retrospective study, results of arterial reconstructions, and not angiography, were used as the gold standard for the blood pressure criteria. The criteria appeared to be 95 percent accurate, 95 percent specific and 95 percent sensitive in the detection of significant aorto-iliac lesions when multiple level disease is present. The positive predictive value and the negative predictive value were both 95 percent. The method is described in detail and reference is made to other studies with similar good results.
