Blood plasma lipids and apolipoproteins as indicators of coronary atherosclerosis. An assessment of one-feature and combined diagnostic value of plasma lipid and apolipoprotein parameters, using stepwise discriminant analysis, was designed to make possible correct differentiation between coronary heart disease (CHD) due to angiographically-verified coronary atherosclerosis and neurocirculatory dystonia (NCD) without signs of coronary arterial affection. The apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein AI (apo B/apo AI) ratio was shown to be the best single apolipoprotein marker capable of correct differentiation between CHD and NCD in 74% of cases. It was similar to the best lipid diagnostic marker, the cholesterol atherogenic index, in terms of discriminating power. The combination of the apo B/apo AI ratio + age + systolic arterial blood pressure proved to be the best combined indicator, bringing the diagnostic error down to 18%.
