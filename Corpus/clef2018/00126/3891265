The course of peripheral vascular disease in non-insulin-dependent diabetes. The present report is an analysis of the course of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) in 619 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM) recruited within 1 yr of diagnosis and followed quarterly for up to 14 yr (X = 10.5 yr). At 13 yr duration, the actuarially determined cumulative risks for intermittent claudication (IC), nonpalpable dorsalis pedis pulse (NPUL), and arterial calcification (CALC) were, respectively, 37.9%, 34.5%, and 60.9% for men and 24.3%, 37.6%, and 32.2% for women. Major amputations (AMP) occurred in only 1.3% of the patients, equivalent to approximately one case per 1000 patients per year. The corresponding incidences of IC, NPUL, and CALC were, respectively, 29, 27, and 47 per 1000 men and 19, 27, and 25 per 1000 women per year. CALC and NPUL were strongly related to mortality. Baseline risk factors with probability levels that suggest a relationship to PVD were, in women, age versus CALC (P less than 0.01), age versus NPUL (P less than 0.05), weight versus NPUL (P less than 0.05), systolic BP versus CALC (P less than 0.01), summed glucose tolerance test versus CALC (P less than 0.01), and triglyceride level versus CALC (P less than 0.05). In men, the only significant risk factors were diminished vibration perception, which was related to NPUL (P less than 0.05), and the serum triglyceride level, which was related to IC (P less than 0.05). In patients who are carefully followed prospectively, IC is far more common, but AMP is far less common than has been generally appreciated. Further studies are needed to clarify the roles of the diverse risk factors that are possibly related.
