Smoking and coronary artery disease assessed by routine coronary arteriography. The association between extent and duration of smoking habit and severity of coronary atheroma was examined in 387 patients undergoing routine coronary ateriography before valve replacement surgery. Total number of cigarettes smoked in life correlated significantly with severity of coronary artery disease (p less than 0.001) and number of coronary arteries with stenoses of 50% or more (p less than 0.001). Severity of coronary artery disease in current smokers was similar to that in former smokers. Multiple regression analysis showed diastolic blood pressure, cigarette consumption, age, ratio of total cholesterol to high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and history of angina to be the important predictors of severity of coronary artery disease. An estimate of the number of cigarettes smoked in life can be useful in identifying patients with coronary artery disease if used in conjunction with data on other important risk factors.
