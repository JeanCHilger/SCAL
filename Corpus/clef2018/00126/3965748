What determines the symptoms associated with subclavian artery occlusive disease? Symptoms associated with subclavian artery stenosis are related to reduced cerebral or arm blood flow. A large difference in blood pressure between the two arms is associated with symptoms of arm ischemia alone and is usually caused by an anatomic variant. The presence or absence of a radiologic steal alone did not seem to determine the type or presence of symptoms. The type of cerebral symptoms seems to be determined by the location of other extracranial vascular stenosis. In patients with hemispheric symptoms there was a higher incidence of anterior circulation insufficiency and a greater reduction in the overall cerebral blood flow. In patients with nonhemispheric symptoms a higher incidence of posterior circulation insufficiency occurred. There may be a small group with nonhemispheric symptoms and a subclavian artery stenosis in whom reversed vertebral artery blood flow is the sole determinant. Perhaps more accurate delineation of other extracranial vascular stenosis would help determine what stenosis in addition to the subclavian artery occlusive disease determines the presenting symptoms. Surgical repair of these lesions may lead to an improved cure rate in this group of patients.
