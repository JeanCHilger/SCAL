Serum HDL/total cholesterol ratio and blood pressure in asymptomatic atherosclerotic lesions of the cervical carotid arteries in men. One hundred neurologically asymptomatic male subjects (aged 50-69 years), randomly selected through population registers, were screened for atherosclerotic lesions of the cervical carotid arteries, using a high resolution multi-gate pulsed Doppler system. In 93 subjects serum was assayed for total and HDL cholesterol. Besides, cuff arterial blood pressure measurements were made. Twenty-three of these subjects (Group III) were classified as abnormal according to the Doppler investigation (degree of narrowing less than 50% in 78% of the cases). Seven of these 23 subjects also had a history of ischemic heart disease or intermittent claudication. Of the 70 subjects with a normal Doppler examination 16 had a history of ischemic heart disease and/or intermittent claudication (Group II). The remaining 54 subjects served as controls (Group I). The frequency of asymptomatic atherosclerotic lesions of the cervical carotid arteries in the population under investigation was 23%. The HDL/total cholesterol ratio was lower and the frequency of high blood pressure higher in the Groups II and III than in Group I. The findings in this study support the idea that a low serum HDL/total cholesterol ratio and high blood pressure have a high degree of association with atherosclerotic lesions of the cervical carotid arteries. This association is already apparent at an early stage of the disease, i.e. in asymptomatic subjects with a slight to moderate degree of carotid artery narrowing.
