Laboratory evaluation of patients with vascular occlusive disease. In addition to the determination of the presenting symptom of patients with peripheral vascular occlusive disease, evaluation of these patients may include the noninvasive measurements of ankle/arm pressure ratio, limb blood flow, and treadmill testing to evaluate the severity of the reduction in blood flow. We have included metabolic studies to assess the effect of this reduced blood flow in patients with stable intermittent claudication (n = 20), and with end-stage ischemia (night and rest pain) (n = 11), and in a control group without vascular disease (n = 8). No correlations were found between the resting limb blood flow, ankle/arm pressure ratios, maximum walking distance, and stated walking distance for the patients with stable claudication. Although the oxygen consumption was reduced only in the patients with end-stage ischemia, the percent oxygen extraction was increased to the same level in the patients with stable claudication and those with end-stage ischemia. Intramuscular stores of high-energy phosphates and glycogen were maintained in all groups with the lactate/pyruvate ratio increased only in the patients with end-stage ischemia. The complex interrelationships between the rate and distribution of blood flow with exercise and enzyme adaptation in patients with vascular disease make current resting hemodynamic and metabolic evaluations a poor reflection of the severity of the clinical condition within each patient group. Therefore laboratory testing may offer no advantage over clinical presentation in the overall evaluation of these patients.
