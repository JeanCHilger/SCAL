Critical assessment of light reflection rheography. Comparative studies of phlebodynamometry using invasive measurement of venous pressure, photoplethysmography and light reflection rheography. In chronic venous insufficiency, phlebodynamometry by invasive venous-pressure measurement demonstrates a reduced pressure drop and an accelerated pressure rise, resulting from the action of the ankle-joint-calf muscle "pump". On the other hand, light-reflexion rheography and photoplethysmography can measure only the duration of the refilling period. Simultaneous measurements were made on 47 legs after phlebography (normal: 8 side-arm varicosities: 17
