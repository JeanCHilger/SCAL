Results of reconstruction of the carotid artery (author's transl). In 90 patients a total of 100 reconstructions of the carotid artery had been performed between 1972 and 1977. No patient died from the operation, 3 suffered central nervous complications, and 33 had transitory defects of cranial nerves. These defects were reversible in all but two patients. After an average observation period of 20 months 11 patients had died (6 from cardiac infarction, 2 from stroke, and 3 from unknown reasons). Of the 31 patients with clinical stage II, 24 were without symptoms, 5 had only rare transient ischaemic attacks, and two patients had the same frequency of attacks as preoperatively. Among the 39 stage III patients 35 showed complete or partial regression of symptoms whereas 4 had had repeat strokes. 55 of the 59 corrected stenoses were patent as shown by Doppler ultrasound. In contrast attempts to correct complete internal carotid artery occlusions showed unsatisfactory results.
