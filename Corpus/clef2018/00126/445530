Noninvasively and invasively measured pulsatile haemodynamics with graded arterial stenosis. Pulsatile haemodynamics associated with graded degrees of experimentally produced stenosis were studied in the canine femoral artery. Invasively determined pulsatile blood flow and noninvasively determined blood velocity with Doppler ultrasound were measured an average of 1.3 and 2.3 cm proximal to the stenosis, respectively. Pulsatile blood pressure was measured 0.6 cm proximal and 3.7 cm distal to the stenosis. With increasing severity of stenosis there were progressive increases in the femoral artery hydraulic input impedance moduli and in the ratio of the impedance moduli to the zero harmonic impedance (or total resistance). This resulted in: a) a progressive reduction in the Fourier harmonic moduli and pulsewave amplitudes of flow, velocity, and distal pressure b) a progressive increase in the fifth-seventh proximal pressure harmonic moduli
