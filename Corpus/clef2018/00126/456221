Nasogastric suction in alcoholic pancreatitis. In order to assess the usefulness of nasogastric suction in acute alcoholic pancreatitis, 37 patients with alcoholic pancreatitis were prospectively investigated. The study failed to demonstrate efficacy of nasogastric suction in those patients with mild disease. Application of a system of prognostic signs proved useful in discriminating between mild and severe disease. Routine use of ultrasound examinations detected three pancreatic pseudocysts before they became clinically apparent. In instituting appropriate therapy in mild pancreatitis, factors such as patient comfort should be considered in the absence of proven significant value of nasogastric suction.
