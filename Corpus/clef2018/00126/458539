Treatment and sequelae of angiographic complications in children. Fourteen cases of thromboembolic complications appeared in 267 consecutive angiographies during a 7-yr period. The arterial circulation has been evaluated both clinically and with oscillometry. The complication rate was substantially higher after cut down then after percutaneous approach (56% vs. 2.7%). Seven patients with signs of total vascular obstruction were subjected to acute thromboectomy whereas three patients with milder clinical symptoms were treated nonoperatively with anticoagulants. Four patients have died during the examination period, the remaining ten patients have been subjected to long term follow-up (mean follow-up period 3 yr). Seven demonstrated normal findings clinically, as well as oscillographically, whereas three patients subjected ot thromboectomy after cut down were clinically normal but decreased oscillographic pulsations could be demonstrated.
