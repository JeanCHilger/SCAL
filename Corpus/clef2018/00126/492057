Functional diagnosis by directional doppler-ultrasound in patients with Raynaud's disease (author's transl). 7 patients with primary and 3 patients with secondary Raynaud's disease were studied by directional Doppler-ultrasound. Flow curves were registered of radial and ulnar artery in rest and during reactive hyperemia following ischemia and muscle work before and under medical treatment. Flow at rest and after provocation was much less than in normal persons. Effect of treatment could be demonstrated, so that this method seems to be very helpful in followup studies of patients with Raynaud's disease.
