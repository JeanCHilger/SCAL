Evaluation of transplant renal artery blood flow by Doppler sound-spectrum analysis. Doppler ultrasonography sound-spectrum analysis (SSA) was used to evaluate blood flow in the transplanted kidney and its renal artery. Seven patients with posttransplant hypertension and a bruit over the transplanted kidney were screened for renal artery stenosis (RAS). In five patients, RAS was diagnosed by SSA, and in two it was not. These findings were confirmed by subsequent angiography in all patients. Three patients studied after surgical correction of their RAS had improvement in their SSA patterns. Fourteen hypertensive patients with a cause other than RAS were evaluated by SSA. None of them had SSA findings suggestive of RAS. Doppler ultrasonography with SSA is an effective, noninvasive technique of monitoring transplant renal blood flow, especially in the screening of hypertensive transplant recipients for transplant RAS.
