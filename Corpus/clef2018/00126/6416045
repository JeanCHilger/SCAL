Comparison of coronary hemodynamic effects of nitroprusside and sublingual nitroglycerin with anterior descending coronary arterial occlusion. This study compares the coronary hemodynamic effects of an infusion of nitroprusside and of sublingual nitroglycerin in the same patients. The coronary hemodynamic responses of the anterior left ventricular (LV) region to both drugs were studied in 9 patients whose anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery was filled by collaterals. Before and during administration of each drug (given in doses designed to produce similar changes in LV diastolic pressure), heart rate, LV and aortic pressure, and anterior regional flow, oxygen delivery and lactate metabolism were measured. Given in this manner, as expected, both drugs decreased the double product of heart rate and systolic pressure. Concomitant with these changes, anterior regional blood flow increased or decreased modest amounts or did not change with either drug. Similar directional flow changes or no change occurred in 6 patients and directionally different changes in the other 3 patients. The ratio of mean aortic pressure or of the double product to anterior regional flow consistently decreased during the administration of both drugs. Additionally, anterior regional myocardial oxygen uptake remained similar during both drug periods compared with control values. Anterior region lactate extraction was abnormal (less than 10%) in 4 of the 9 patients during the initial control period. Lactate extraction was usually normal during both the nitroprusside and the nitroglycerin periods. In general, coronary hemodynamic values were remarkably similar during both of these periods. Thus, although relative differences in systemic arterial and venous dilation were obtained with nitroprusside and nitroglycerin, similar and beneficial coronary hemodynamic changes generally occurred.
