Percutaneous brachial catheterization using a modified sheath and new catheter system. An alternative method for left heart catheterization via the brachial artery, without cutdown, is described. Percutaneous brachial catheterization was done with a modified 7F side-arm sheath with check valve. A modified 7F high flow catheter was developed employing characteristics of both multipurpose and Sones catheters. The technique was used in 100 patients for left heart catheterization, in patients with and without aortic valve disease, for left ventricular angiography and selective coronary angiography. There were no failures or serious complications. All puncture sites were managed with 15-20 minutes of compression using only a blood pressure cuff or finger pressure. Bleeding was controlled with restoration of the radial pulse in all but one patient, who had severe peripheral brachial atherosclerosis. Cutdown and thrombectomy performed before he left the laboratory using standard catheterization techniques promptly restored blood flow. It is our impression that this technique facilitated outpatient catheterizations, repeat catheterizations at sites of previous cutdowns, and reduced patient discomfort.
