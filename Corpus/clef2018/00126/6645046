Cardiac function and peripheral circulatory adjustments in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Observations during the early stage of AMI. Since little is known concerning the effect of different types of cardiac dysfunction on the peripheral circulation in acute myocardial infarction, cardiac and peripheral circulatory hemodynamics were measured simultaneously and sequentially in the Coronary Care Unit in 40 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) using a Swan-Ganz catheter and venous occlusion plethysmography. Patients were classified by clinical assessment (Killip) and into four hemodynamic subsets (HS) according to pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and cardiac index (CI) measures obtained by invasive central hemodynamic monitoring (Forrester): uncomplicated AMI, HS-I (PCWP less than or equal to 18 mmHg, CI greater than 2.2 L/min/m2) 15 pulmonary congestion, HS-II (PCWP greater than 18 mmHg, CI greater than 2.2 L/min/m2) 15
