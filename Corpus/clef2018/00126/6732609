Vocal rehabilitation by tracheogastric shunt method after pharyngolaryngoesophagectomy for malignancy. After pharyngolaryngoesophagectomy had been performed to remove a malignant tumor, a shunt was created between the elevated gastric tube and the trachea for vocal rehabilitation in two patients. By covering the tracheostoma, the patients were able to produce a substituted voice without any reflux. However, strange vibrations of the gastric tube slightly disturbed the intelligibility of the shunt voice.
