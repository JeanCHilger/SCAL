Current diagnosis of venous diseases of the lower limbs. The haemodynamic of venous circulation of lower limbs seems to be not yet fully understood and different methods are available to study clinical patterns of venous insufficiency, deep venous incompetence or venous occlusion. Simple and common methods as venography, venous doppler and plethysmography are frequently used but other method as impedance plethysmography, ambulatory venous pressure, photoplethysmography, isotopes and thermography can be used for research or clinical investigation. The techniques and the indications of these tests are reviewed and critically analyzed to evaluate the best approach to the patients with venous pathology.
