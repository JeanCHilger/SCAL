Utility of wide and narrow blood pressure cuffs in the hemodynamic assessment of aortoiliac occlusive disease. One hundred lower extremities were evaluated by measurement of common femoral intra-arterial pressure and high-thigh Doppler-derived segmental pressures using wide and narrow blood pressure cuffs to assess the accuracy of high-thigh pressures in the evaluation of aortoiliac disease. Sixty-four extremities were also studied by arteriography. The results were analyzed using the common femoral intra-arterial pressure as the standard. The accuracy was poor for both the wide (52%) and narrow (73%) cuff techniques. No significant differences between the two techniques were evident in regard to the incidence of false positive (wide cuff, 75% narrow cuff, 65%) and false negative (wide cuff, 3%
