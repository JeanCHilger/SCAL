Sequelae of unilateral deep venous thrombosis in plethysmography of the calf. Twenty four patients suffering from unilateral venous disturbances revealed by Doppler and secondary to a deep venous thrombosis were examined. The calf venous haemodynamics was analyzed by use of a strain-jauge plethysmograph. We determined the increase in venous volume due to the inflation of a thigh pneumatic cuff (pressure at 20, 40 and 60 mm Hg delta V20, delta V40, delta V60). The maximal venous output (Vout) was measured after a quick release of the 60 mm Hg pressure. The maximal venous drainage (VMM) was assessed during a rhythmic exercise (tiptoeing) while standing
