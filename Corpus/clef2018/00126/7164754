Value of the detection of arteriosclerotic lesions with labeled autologous thrombocytes. In 44 patients with clinical signs of carotid artery stenosis a positive Doppler-ultrasound was obtained. In all patients the lesions were confirmed by angiography. In the patients labelling of autologous platelets with 111Indium-oxine-sulphate was done in order to calculate the platelet half-life. In addition we tried to visualize the verified atherosclerotic lesions under a gamma-camera. In all patients the platelet half-life was significantly shortened in comparison to the controls. In none of the patients studied a visualization of the angiographically verified atherosclerotic lesions could be obtained. These findings point out, that only in recently developed and very severe atherosclerotic lesions the number of platelets deposed on the vascular surface is enough to allow gamma-camera imaging.
