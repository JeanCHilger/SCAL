Hypoperfusion and hyperperfusion in the immature lung. Pulmonary arterial development following ligation of the left pulmonary artery in the newborn pig. The left pulmonary artery and ductus arteriosus were ligated in 14 newborn pigs. Animals were put to death at intervals between 2 and 24 weeks of age. In each animal a cardiac catheterization was performed before sacrifice. Pulmonary arterial development in both lungs was studied by applying quantitative morphometric techniques to the infected and inflated specimens. In the right lung, pulmonary arterial pressure and resistance fell to normal after birth however, structurally, muscularity remained high in arteries less than 75 mu in diameter. Size and number of intra-acinar arteries increased normally, not excessively, with age despite the abnormally high flow. After 16 weeks in all animals, muscularity increased significantly in arteries of all sizes
