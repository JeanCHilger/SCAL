Comparison of reactive hyperemia and treadmill tests in the evaluation of peripheral vascular disease. The systolic ankle pressure response to thigh cuff occlusion (reactive hyperemia test) was compared with a similar measurement after treadmill exercise in 48 limbs of 24 normal volunteers. The reactive hyperemia test was then performed on 26 legs in 16 patients with clinical evidence of arterial disease of the leg and abnormal treadmill tests (mean decrease 39 +/- 24 percent). No decrease in pressure occurred in normal subjects after exercise. All control subjects demonstrated a decrease in pressure after thigh cuff occlusion (34 +/- 7.9 percent). The percent pressure decrease during reactive hyperemia in the abnormal group was significantly lower (49.7 +/- 19 percent p less than 0.001). There was a high correlation between the percent decrease in pressure during reactive hyperemia and the decrease after exercise in the claudicants (r = 0.69
