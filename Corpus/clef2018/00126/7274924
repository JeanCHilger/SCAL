Doppler sonography in phlebological diagnosis. Doppler-sonography is a helpful new technique in clinical phlebological diagnosis. The method can be used for measuring systolic blood pressure of ankle arteries, for examination of venous function as well as for the evaluation of venous occlusion. By calculating the systolic pressure gradient between arm and ankle arteries peripheral arterial diseases can be detected and evaluated regarding clinical severity. In diagnosis of venous diseases the normal blood flow signal in the femoral vein--i.e. expiratory flow and inspiratory stop--are compared to pathological findings. If there is venous occlusion, a continuous flow signal will be registered. The method is most reliable in detecting thrombosis of the deep pelvic and femoral veins. Venous thrombosis of the calf cannot be diagnosed at the moment. Venous valvular insufficiency leads to a continuous flow signal during Valsalva's pressing manoeuvre. The method is limited by the fact that functional, but not morphological parameters are registered.
