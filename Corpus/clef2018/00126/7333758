Angiological diagnosis in rehabilitation (author's transl). Based on 2450 hemodynamic-vascular examinations by means of atraumatic techniques (particularly ultrasound vascular echography, Doppler-flowmetry, dynamographical circulation analysis, impedance cardiography) on 1242 stationary and ambulatory patients the capacity of a riskless angiological program aiming at practice and therapy is resumed. Due to their high validity and accuracy the methods proved to be not only screening and selection base for the use of special invasive measurements, but also self-supporting requirement for the respectively adequate rehabilitative management and therapeutic consequences in circulation and cardiovascular diseases. The registrated findings, especially in stenosis of the carotid and vertebral arteries, cerebral arteriosclerotic processes, hypertensive and hypotonic syndromes, orthostatic, vegetative and stress-induced dysregulations, differential diagnosis of cephalic troubles (e.g. headache, dizziness and so on), in peripheral arterial and venous disorders as well as in cardiocerebral problems, were evaluated effectively and integrated into the clinic and basic research.
