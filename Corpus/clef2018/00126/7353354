Ultrasound measurements of pulse-wave velocity in the peripheral arteries of diabetic subjects. 1. Pulse-wave velocity in both upper and lower limbs has been measured in a series of diabetic and control subjects. Subjects were studied with a Doppler ultrasound system and a real-time frequency analyser. 2. The subjects comprised three groups: (a) diabetic subjects with peripheral neuropathy (43) (b) non-complicated diabetic subjects (8)
