Reliability of oscillography and Doppler sonography in the diagnosis of arterial obstructive disease in comparison with arteriography. In 81 patients arteriographically by means of the Doppler-method and oscillographically altogether 130 lower extremities were examined. Comparing the two non-invasive methods with the arteriography we have established their good diagnostic possibilities, which on an average were not lower than 84%. Isolated obstructions and stenoses of several arterial segments are to be recognized practically in 100%. With increasing number of lesions the diagnostic possibilities decrease. The two methods supplement themselves very well and are an important functional enrichment of the arteriography. These two together achieve the 90%-level of reliability (covered by the reliability interval of 95%) and are fully sufficient for diagnosing in conservative therapeutic methods. But for a reconstructive intervention is always necessary a complete aorto- and arteriography of the whole extremity.
