Classification of peripheral occlusive arterial diseases based on symptoms, signs and distal blood pressure measurements. Systolic blood pressures at toe and ankle were measured in 459 consecutive patients with occlusive arterial disease. Fifty-eight per cent had intermittent claudication with arterial disease of all degrees of severity. Seventeen per cent complained of rest pain having toe systolic pressures below 30 mmHg, half had arterial lesions proximal to the groin. None had diabetes. Fourteen per cent non-diabetic patients had chronic ulcerations on the foot with arterial lesions similar to those in patients with rest pain. Eleven per cent diabetic patients with chronic ulcerations had less pronounced occlusive arterial disease which was located distally on the legs. A classification in three groups is suggested: (1) ischemia only during exercise (2) ischemia at rest with or without ulcerations: and (3) diabetics with chronic ulcerations.
