Minimal distal pressure rise after reconstructive arterial surgery in patients with multiple obstructive arteriosclerosis. Forty-one reconstructive procedures were carried out in thirty-five consecutive patients. Average age was 63 years (range 46-75). Thrombendarterectomy or by-pass procedures were carried out in twenty-nine proximal and twelve femoropopliteal reconstructions. Twenty-three patients had rest pain fifteen had ischemic ulcers. The preoperative median pressure index (per cent of arm systolic pressure) was 10% on the 1st toe. At the 10th postoperative day the median toe pressure rose to 25%. A further rise took place at the one month control to 30% which was unchanged throughout the study. All patients with a persistent postoperative toe pressure above 20% of arm systolic pressure were ultimately relieved from rest pain and chronic ulcers.
