Stent placement without thrombolysis in chronic iliac arterial occlusion: preliminary clinical evaluation. Intra-arterial stent placement without thrombolytic therapy was performed in four patients with chronic iliac arterial occlusion. The length of angiographically observed occluded lesions ranged from 2.0 cm to 14.0 cm (mean: 5.1 cm). The implanted stents included four Wall stents, two Strecker stents and one Palmaz stent. The mean ankle-arm index before and after stenting improved from 0.48 to 0.77, while the mean pressure gradient improved from 82.5 mmHg to 3.0 mmHg. Symptoms were eliminated in all patients after the procedure. No major complications were encountered during the procedure. Primary stent implantation in chronic iliac occlusions is useful to avoid bypass surgery.
