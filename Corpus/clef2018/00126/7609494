Calcium antagonist antihypertensive treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetics: efficacy and safety of lacidipine versus nifedipine SR. Arterial hypertension is a chronic condition regarded as one of the main risk factors for development of coronary atherosclerosis. As dyslipidemia and reduced glucose tolerance are also risk factors for coronary disease, it is considered important to use antihypertensive drugs having no negative effects on lipid and glucose metabolism when diabetic patients are treated for hypertension. Lacidipine, a new dihydropyridine-like calcium antagonist, has been shown in in vivo and in vitro preclinical studies to possess potent, long-lasting antihypertensive activity. The present study compared the efficacy and safety of once-daily treatment with lacidipine versus nifedipine SR given twice-daily in non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients. Results have shown a similar efficacy of the two treatments: 6 months later, both drugs had reduced blood pressure values [lacidipine from 184.8/105.2 mm Hg to 144.4/87.1 mm Hg nifedipine slow-release (SR) from 182.3/106.8 mm Hg to 143.6/89.4 mmHg]. However, lacidipine exhibited a lower incidence of adverse events (particularly ankle edema and tachycardia) than nifedipine SR. Finally, both treatments showed no negative effect on metabolic parameters (total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood glucose).
