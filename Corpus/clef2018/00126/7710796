Percutaneous gastrostomy guided by ultrasound and fluoroscopy. Percutaneous gastrostomy, utilizing a dedicated catheterization kit, with a combination of ultrasonographic (US) and fluoroscopic guidance, was carried out in 27 patients. The main indication for gastrostomy was the need for nutritional support in malignant esophageal stricture. After distending the stomach with water via a nasogastric tube, the gastric antrum was punctured under US guidance and a guide wire was inserted, followed by fluoroscopically guided tract dilatation and insertion of a 2.5-mm Cope-loop catheter. In all patients but one (96%) the procedure was successfully completed in one or 2 attempts. Two complications occurred: one case of a small subcutaneous abscess near the puncture site, and one late incident of dislodgement of a catheter without string-loop fixation, which had been inserted at a catheter exchange after 6 weeks. Percutaneous gastrostomy guided by US and fluoroscopy is a safe and efficacious alternative to endoscopic and surgical gastrostomy.
