Two laparoscopic techniques for resection of leiomyoma in the stomach. We report two surgical treatments by laparoscopic techniques of a leiomyoma in the stomach, each for one patient. The patients, one a 59-year-old man and the other a 28-year-old woman, were found to have an asymptomatic submucosal tumor in the stomach in an annual medical screening. One tumor, 1.5 cm in maximum diameter, was located on the anterior wall of the gastric body and was excised extracorporeally by laparoscopy-guided surgery. The other was 1.9 cm in maximum diameter, on the anterior wall of the antrum, and was excised intracorporeally using only laparoscopic surgery. Their postoperative courses were uneventful. They drank clear liquid after the removal of a nasogastric tube on the first postoperative day and had a solid meal on the second postoperative day. They were discharged from the hospital on the seventh and eighth postoperative days.
