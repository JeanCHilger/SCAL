A technique for performing transesophageal echocardiography safely in patients with Zenker's diverticulum. Transesophageal echocardiography was indicated for evaluation of mitral valve pathology in a patient with a Zenker's diverticulum. However, transesophageal echocardiography is potentially dangerous and therefore relatively contraindicated in such patients. Our gastroenterologist directly intubated the esophagus with a fiberoptic endoscope and introduced an overtube through which transesophageal echocardiography was performed without incident.
