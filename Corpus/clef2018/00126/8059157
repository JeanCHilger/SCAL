Role of biliary intubation in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis without known etiology. Biliary tubage, is interesting in the aetiological research of acute pancreatitis, when the origin is unknown after anamnesis, clinical examination, abdominal ultrasonographic studies and retrograde cholangiography.

Biliary microscopic crystals drive the patients to the cholecystectomy to prevent acute pancreatitis relapses.
