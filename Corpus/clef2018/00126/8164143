Pediatric matrix biplane transesophageal echo probe: evaluation of probe selection in patients. We have developed four different probes for the wide use of transesophageal echocardiography in children. The adult matrix biplane probe (M-BP) can generate transverse and longitudinal plane images simultaneously from a single transducer, and facilitates easier and faster understanding of the three-dimensional anatomy of the heart. This probe can be used in patients weighing more than 15 kg. The pediatric matrix biplane probe (PM-BP) has the same function as the M-BP in a smaller probe head and shaft, and can be used in patients weighing more than 5 kg. The conventional pediatric biplane probe (P-BP) with two transducers has a smaller probe head profile than the PM-BP, and can be used in a baby as small as 2.7 kg. The newborn single plane probe (N-SP) has the smallest profile with a 4 mm diameter shaft, and can be used like a nasogastric tube. We choose probes according to the size of the patient and purpose of the study. As a rule, smaller probes are less invasive and reduce the risk of the study. However, larger probes have better image quality and penetration. Proper selection of the probe is the key to the safe and effective use of this new methodology.
