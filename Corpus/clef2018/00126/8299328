Sonographic findings in gastrointestinal and peritoneal tuberculosis. The various ultrasound (US) findings in 90 patients with abdominal (gastrointestinal, peritoneal, mesenteric and lymph node) tuberculosis (TB) studied in an area of high incidence of TB over a 1 year period were analysed. The lesions encountered were intestinal (n = 31), extraintestinal (n = 39), or a combination (n = 20). The extraintestinal lesions included free and loculated ascites (n = 36), localized ascites ('Club Sandwich sign') (n = 4), adhesions (n = 14), peritoneal thickening (n = 14), peritoneal nodules (n = 3), lymphadenopathy (n = 23) and cold abscesses (n = 10)-of these, the presence of fine fibrinous strands in the ascetic fluid, localized ascites and caseous or calcified lymph nodes were highly suspicious of a diagnosis of TB in appropriate clinical settings. The bowel lesions were characterized by concentric bowel wall thickening (n = 31) with ulceration in six. Bowel thickening, when present in the ileocaecal junction and especially when situated in the subhepatic position, was suggestive of a tuberculous etiology. Complex masses in the abdomen pointed to an advanced stage of the disease. US is a useful imaging modality in patients clinically suspected of having abdominal TB for diagnosis and follow-up, although in a few cases differentiation of it from metastatic disease is difficult. When bowel involvement is suspected, barium studies should be performed.
