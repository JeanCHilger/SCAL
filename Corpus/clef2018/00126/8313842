Duodenal tuberculosis. A rare cause of a covered perforation in the duodenal bulb. Vague upper abdominal pain, weight loss (10 kg) and recurrent bouts of fever had been present for several months in a 77-year-old woman. Abdominal ultrasonography in the region of the head of the pancreas and duodenum had demonstrated several lymphomas, some of them with "air streaking". This finding suggested penetration from the duodenum to neighbouring lymph nodes. Plain film of the abdomen did not show free air, but at gastroscopy a covered perforation into the surrounding lymph nodes was found. At first lymphoma or Crohn's disease were considered in the differential diagnosis. But the finding of acid-fast bacteria in a biopsy from the pelvic crest suggested intestinal tuberculosis with dissemination. This diagnosis was confirmed by the direct demonstration of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in gastric juice. Under tuberculostatic treatment with daily 0.3 g isoniazid, 0.45 g rifampicin, 0.8 ethambutol and 1.5 g pyrazinamide, as well as 50 mg prednisolone to prevent stricture, the size of the tuberculous ulcer had markedly decreased within 2 weeks. Follow-up gastroscopy after 6 months showed almost complete healing without stricture. However rare, gastrointestinal tuberculosis should not be forgotten in the differential diagnosis because it can imitate a large variety of gastrointestinal diseases.
