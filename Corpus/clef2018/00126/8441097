Confirmation of transpyloric feeding tube placement by ultrasonography. We compared ultrasonography with radiography for placement of transpyloric feeding tubes. Ultrasound study successfully determined tube tip position and gave functional information unavailable with radiography, allowing for greater accuracy of placement and the observation of transpyloric reflux of feedings.
