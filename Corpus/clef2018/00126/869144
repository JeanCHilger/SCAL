Femoral artery pressure monitoring. Use of the Seldinger technique. A case of bilateral femoral arterial occlusion following the Seldinger technique of arterial puncture for monitoring blood pressure is described. Sixty patients were closely studied for possible complications of this technique, using pedal blood pressure, and skin temperature to supplement clinical observation. Despite the occasional complications which are described we consider this to be a safe and valuable technique in selected circumstances.
