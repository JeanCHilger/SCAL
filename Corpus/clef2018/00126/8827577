The movements of fetuses with congenital myotonic dystrophy in utero. The movements in two fetuses with congenital myotonic dystrophy were recorded on fetal actocardiograms. The two fetuses showed gross movements associated with FHR accelerations as normal fetus. One of them showed swallowing on amniofetogram, and hiccuping on fetal actocardiogram. Both, however, were extremely hypotonic and neither displayed any gross movement, respiratory movement or swallowing postnatally. Intubation and nasal feeding were required for a long period of time after birth in both cases. The buoyancy of amniotic fluid may help the affected fetus to make gross movement in utero.
