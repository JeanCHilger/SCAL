The role of different investigations in diagnosis of functional disorders of the biliary system. The paper presents the results obtained upon examination of inpatients with various types of biliary dyskinesia. The examination included: fraction chromatic duodenal intubation, stepwise manometry, cholecystography, ultrasound investigation of the liver, gall bladder, biochemical tests of the bile. Fraction duodenal intubation discovered gall bladder dysfunction. The manometry was necessary for diagnosis of duodenal hypertension. X-ray revealed primary defects in gall bladder motility. It is concluded that the diagnosis of functional disorders implies combined clinical and instrumental modalities.
