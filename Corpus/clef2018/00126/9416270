Effects of hyperglycemia on cerebral blood flow and edema formation after carotid artery occlusion in Fischer 344 rats. This study examines whether during bilateral carotid artery occlusion in Fischer 344 rats, hyperglycemia induces cerebrovascular changes that enhance brain edema formation. Preischemic hyperglycemia was induced by intraperitoneal administration of D-glucose solution. Laser-Doppler flowmetry, indicated that after the initial decline in blood flow with carotid occlusion (36 +/- 4% of preischemic), hyperglycemic but not control rats showed a further progressive decrease to 19 +/- 2% of preischemic at 120 minutes (p < 0.001). Brain water content was significantly higher in hypercompared to normoglycemic rats after both 2 hours of permanent occlusion (3.86 +/- 0.05 vs. 3.73 +/- 0.03 g/g dry wt. p < 0.05) and 2 hours of temporary occlusion followed by 1 hour of reperfusion (4.01 +/- 0.08 vs. 3.71 +/- 0.03 g/g dry wt.
