Recognition of intussusception around gastrojejunostomy tubes in children. We describe antegrade intussusceptions of duodenum and jejunum around gastrojejunostomy tubes seen on sonography and fluoroscopic contrast tube studies. Reduction of the intussusception was achieved by bolus injection of air or contrast medium through the tube or exchange over a wire.Sonography and fluoroscopic contrast tube studies permit diagnosis of intussusception around gastrojejunostomy tubes.
