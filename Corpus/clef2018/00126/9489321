Indirect diagnosis of aortic coarctation by Doppler color echography. Velocimetric and spectral aspects in one of our cases. Description of a case report.The case of a 55-years-old man with a previous history of hypertension, treated for several years with many antihypertensive drugs without improvement is described.The patient was affected with a unknown coarctation of the aorta. This disease, in fact, is an important cause of secondary hypertension. Adult patients, if asymptomatic, are most often diagnosed because of hypertension or murmur on a routine examination. This congenital disease can be demonstrated on suprasternal notch two-dimensional echocardiographic views along with increased Doppler flow velocity across the coarctation site. TC scan and aortography confirm the degree and nature of the aortic narrowing.In the case reported color Doppler ultrasonography demonstrated two peculiar aspects of the coarctation of the aorta: 1) detection of a stenotic flow in the abdominal aorta, abdominal and lower extremities arteries 2) marked renal vasodilatation secondary to compensatory mechanisms that intervene in the renal flow reduction
