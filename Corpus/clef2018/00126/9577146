Venous ulcers of the lower limbs in the aged. Indications for bandages. There are many causes of ulcer of the lower limb. In the elderly, venous ulcers and arteriosclerosis often coexist for this reason pressure bandages might be contraindicated for the risk of precipitating a potentially critical arterial flow. In this work, the conditions which allow a safely treatment with pressure bandage in the elderly are evaluated.Eleven self-sufficient elderly, with venous ulcerations to one leg only, and ankle pressure/omeral pressure between 0.92 and 0.86 were treated with elastic bandaging of the leg.All patients completed the treatment, with healing of the ulcer obtained in 3-8 months time. So far none of them relapsed.In the elderly, in selected cases, when Pc/Po > 0.86, pressure bandages can be safely applied to heal the ulcer, without running the risk of endangering arterial circulation.
