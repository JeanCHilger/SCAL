The clinical significance of phasic duodenal intubation and ultrasonic monitoring of the gallbladder in healthy subjects. Overall twelve essentially healthy subjects were evaluated for the tone and contractile function of the gallbladder according to phases of interdigestive motility of duodenum as were for effects on these functions of phase-by-phase administration of 30 ml of 33% solution of magnesium sulphate. The gallbladder in healthy individuals was found out to function according to phases of duodenal interdigestive motility and be ready to evacuate bile during phase II. Prior diagnostic techniques did not take advantage of interdigestive phase of duodenal and gallbladder motility during which phase a standard stimulating agent was routinely employed. This can lead to wrong diagnosis of the functional state of the biliary tract, gallbladder and their sphincters in the interdigestive period: incomplete gallbladder emptying from bile in case the stimulating agent is being introduced during phase I or III hyperdiagnosis of cholecystitis
