Non-invasive diagnosis of arteriosclerosis. The author gives an overview about possibilities of noninvasive diagnostic ways in peripheral arterial occlusive disease. An exact diagnosis of macrocirculation pathology can be achieved by these methods and their combinations. The importance of non-invasive diagnostic methods concerning alteration of microcirculation--as indicators of chronic critical leg ischemia--is emphasized. According to the conclusion of the overview by noninvasive diagnostic evaluation of peripheral arterial occlusive disease an early diagnosis and an objective assessment become possible. The use of these diagnostic methods has advantage in eliminating of the risk factors, planning adequate therapy and as a final result improving the prognosis.
