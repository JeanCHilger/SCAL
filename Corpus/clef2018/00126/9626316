Risk factors for restenosis after balloon angioplasty in focal iliac stenosis. The risk factors for restenosis after angioplasty have not yet been established because of the inconsistencies among treated lesions, differences in the techniques used, and variable end points. We evaluated the predictive variables relating to postangioplasty restenosis.One hundred sixty-one transluminal balloon angioplasties were studied in 138 consecutive patients with focal iliac arterial stenosis (< or = 4 cm) caused by arteriosclerosis between January 1981 and December 1995. Restenosis was diagnosed on the basis of recurrent symptoms associated with an apparent drop in the ankle-brachial pressure index and angiographic visualization of restenosis.Being younger than 60 years (risk ratio 2.585) and poor runoff (risk ratio 2.328) were found to be important variables predicting restenosis by the Cox regression model. The restenosis-free patency rates were significantly better in patients older than 60 years of age (p = 0.0242), with good distal runoff (p = 0.0487), and without diabetes (p = 0.0111).Being younger than 60 years of age and poor distal runoff are important predictors of restenosis after iliac balloon angioplasty.
