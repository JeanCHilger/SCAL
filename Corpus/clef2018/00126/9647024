Percutaneous sonographic gastrostomy: method, indications, and problems. This study evaluated the application of ultrasound (US) guidance in the percutaneous placement of gastric feeding tubes in patients in whom endoscopic placement of a nutrition tube is not possible.Thirty-eight patients with upper gastrointestinal obstruction were entered in a prospective study with US-guided nutrition tube application. Feasibility of placement, side effects, and nutritional states were monitored for a mean follow-up of 4 months.Ultrasound allowed rapid puncture after filling of the stomach with water through a nasal tube in 34/38 cases. In four cases a total upper gastrointestinal obstruction required an initial stomach insufflation through a direct puncture. Puncture-related major complications were not observed. Minor complications during the observation time were one late dislocation, five cases with broken material after about 6 months (four could be changed by using the Seldinger technique), and two minor local infections. The nutrition through feeding tubes stabilized body weight and body composition parameters.The percutaneous sonographic gastrostomy (PSG) is a safe and minimally invasive procedure for enteral nutrition in all cases with upper gastrointestinal obstruction when endoscopic placement of a feeding tube is not possible. Percutaneous sonographic gastrostomy may help to stabilize the nutritional parameters and general condition in patients with malignant diseases.
