Regional sympathetic function in high spinal cord injury during mental stress and autonomic dysreflexia. Centrally mediated sympathetic stimulation of subjects who have suffered a spinal cord injury (SCI) does not activate the decentralized part of the body below the level of the lesion, whereas experimental data indicate an exaggerated response above the level of the lesion. SCI subjects may exhibit an autonomic dysreflexia reaction following afferent stimulation below the level of the lesion. In order to investigate the function of the sympathetic nervous system above and below the level of the lesion, regional noradrenaline spillover was measured by means of steady-state isotope dilution technique above (forearm) and below (leg) the level of the lesion at baseline, during mental stress and following bladder stimulation in nine SCI subjects (mean age 41 years level of injury C7-T4
