Effect of intragastric or intraduodenal administration of a polymeric diet on gallbladder motility, small-bowel transit time, and hormone release. During postpyloric tube feeding, GI intolerance is observed more frequently than during prepyloric feeding, possibly by evoking a stronger GI response.We investigated the effect of intragastric and intraduodenal administration of a polymeric diet (125 kcal/h) on gallbladder motility (by ultrasonography), duodeno-cecal transit time (by lactulose H2 breath test), and GI hormone release (including cholecystokinin, pancreatic polypeptide, and gastrin). Six healthy subjects (two male, four female mean age 22 yr, range 18-27 yr) were studied on two separate occasions in random order during 6 h of continuous administration of the diet through either the gastric or duodenal port of a two-lumen tube.Intraduodenal feeding resulted in a more rapid contraction of the gallbladder, from 32 +/- 4 to 23 +/- 4 cm3 at 10 min (p < 0.05), reaching a minimum of 6 +/- 1 cm3, in contrast to intragastric feeding (31 +/- 4 to 19 +/- 3 cm3 at 60 min, p < 0.05 minimum 14 +/- 1 cm3). The gallbladder remained contracted during the 6-h study period during both intraduodenal and intragastric feeding. Small-bowel transit time was significantly accelerated during intraduodenal compared with intragastric feeding (51 +/- 12 vs 81 +/- 9 minIntraduodenal feeding elicited a stronger GI response than intragastric feeding, as demonstrated by accelerated small-bowel transit time, more rapid and stronger gallbladder contractions, and increased cholecystokinin and pancreatic polypeptide release. Gastrin release, on the other hand, was stronger during intragastric feeding.
