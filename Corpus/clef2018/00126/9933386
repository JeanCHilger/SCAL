Non-operative management of arterial liver hemorrhages. A retrospective evaluation of embolotherapy in patients with arterial liver hemorrhages was carried out. Twenty-six patients, ranging in age from 10 days to 77 years with active arterial liver hemorrhages, underwent non-surgical embolotherapy. Bleeding was attributed to trauma (n = 21), tumor (n = 3), pancreatitis (n = 1), or unknown cause (n = 1). Twenty-nine embolizations were performed via a transfemoral (n = 26) or biliary (n = 2) approach. One bare Wallstent was placed into the common hepatic artery via to an axillary route to cover a false aneurysm due to pancreatitis. Treatment was controlled in 4 patients by cholangioscopy (n = 2) or by intravascular ultrasound (n = 2). Prior surgery had failed in 3 patients. Intervention controlled the hemorrhage in 24 of 26 (92%) patients within 24 h. Embolotherapy failed in 1 patient with pancreatic carcinoma and occlusion of the portal vein. In 1 patient with an aneurysm of the hepatic artery treated by Wallstent insertion, total occlusion was not achieved in the following days, as demonstrated by CT and angiography. However, colour Doppler flow examination showed no flow in the aneurysm 6 months later. Complications were one liver abscess, treated successfully by percutaneous drainage for 10 days, and one gallbladder necrosis after superselective embolization of the cystic artery. Embolization is a effective tool with a low complication rate in the treatment of liver artery hemorrhage, even in patients in whom surgery has failed.
