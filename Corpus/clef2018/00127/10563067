A national survey of thoracic surgical practice in the UK. We conducted a survey of thoracic surgery in the UK today. Questionnaires were sent to 75 cardiothoracic surgeons, known to perform thoracic surgery regularly we had a 100% response. The commonest preoperative investigations for carcinoma of the oesophagus were serum alkaline phosphatase (90%), GGT (69%), contrast swallow (80%), ultrasound of abdomen (71%) and CT scan of chest and abdomen (60%). After oesophagectomy, 84% of the surgeons inserted nasogastric tubes and 31% sent their patients to the intensive care unit. Oral fluids were started on days 3-5 in 81% of cases, and 58% of the surgeons requested a postoperative contrast swallow, usually between the seventh and tenth postoperative days, after oral fluids had been started. Most of the surgeons nearly always used staplers for a given procedure or else completely avoided them for that part of the operation. The commonest use of staplers was for bronchial closure in pneumonectomy (67%) and lobectomy (48%) and in constructing an oesophageal anastomosis (25%). Twenty per cent of the surgeons did not insert a chest drain after pneumonectomy, while 65% observed the protocol of chest drain insertion with short intermittent unclamping, usually every hour, followed by removal of the drain, usually the next morning. Thoracic surgeons vary widely in their surgical practices. In a well structured training programme, trainees should rotate between several units so they are exposed to different techniques and ideas and acquire a broad based training.
