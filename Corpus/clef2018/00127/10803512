BIOMED-1 concerted action report: flow cytometric characterization of CD7+ cell subsets in normal bone marrow as a basis for the diagnosis and follow-up of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). The European BIOMED-1 Concerted Action was initiated in 1994 to improve and standardize the flow cytometric detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) in acute leukemia (AL). Three different protocols were defined to identify the normal subsets of B, T and myeloid cells in bone marrow (BM), and were applied to the different types of AL in order to study aberrant immunophenotypes. Using sensitive acquisition methods ('live gate') T cell subsets in normal BM could be identified with five triple-stains: CD7/CD5/CD3, CD7/CD4/CD8, CD7/CD2/CD3, CD7/CD38/CD34 and TdT/CD7/surface or cytoplasmic (cy)CD3 (antibodies conjugated with FITC/PE/PECy5 or PerCP, respectively). The identification of T cell subsets in BM allowed definition of 'empty spaces' (ie areas of flow cytometric plots where normally no cells are found). All studied T-ALL cases (n = 65) were located in 'empty spaces' and could be discriminated from normal T cells. The most informative triple staining was TdT/CD7/cyCD3, which was aberrant in 91% of T-ALL cases. In most cases, two or more aberrant patterns were found. Apparently the immunophenotypes of T-ALL differ significantly from normal BM T cells. This is mostly caused by their thymocytic origin, but also the neoplastic transformation might have affected antigen expression patterns. Application of the five proposed marker combinations in T-ALL contributes to standardized detection of MRD, since cells persistent or reappearing in the 'empty spaces' can be easily identified in follow-up BM samples during and after treatment.
