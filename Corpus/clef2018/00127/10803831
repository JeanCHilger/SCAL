The role of laparoscopy in the treatment of intra-abdominal malignancies. The role of laparoscopy in the care of patients with cancer is currently evolving. Numerous experimental and clinical studies have attempted to elucidate the nature and cause of port-site metastases--particularly to discern whether they simply are a marker of advanced disease, or if they are a result of the laparoscopic intervention. Laparoscopy has a role in establishing the diagnosis of cancer in some situations by allowing biopsy of intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal masses, lymph nodes, and visceral lesions, as well as examination of abdominal contents under direct vision or with ultrasound probes. Laparoscopy is useful in the staging of established malignancies such as pancreatic cancer, hepatic lesions, lymphoma, and esophageal cancer. Laparoscopy also has a role in the surgical treatment of a variety of malignancies, including gastric carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, splenic malignancies, adrenal cancers, and colon cancer. The safety of laparoscopy for the definitive resection of colon cancer has not yet been proven, and until the results of a randomized prospective trial currently underway are known, should be performed only in the context of a clinical trial. Lastly, laparoscopy can play an important role in the palliative care of the cancer patient in performing procedures such as feeding-tube placement or intestinal stoma creation. It is imperative that using laparoscopy in the care of patients with malignancies be carefully and thoroughly evaluated since this technique can either benefit or adversely affect survival or quality of life.
