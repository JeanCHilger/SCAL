Analytical and clinical evaluation of troponin I determination on dimension RXL-HM. The evaluation of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) on the Dimension RxL-HM analyzer is presented. The one-step enzyme immunoassay is based on two cTnI specific monoclonal antibodies. Performed on a separate module of the analyzer, assay-time is 17 minutes. Using as criterion a between-run impression CV <20% the functional limit of detection was set at 0.1 microg/l. Cutoff level for minor myocardial damage of 0.1 microg/l was found. In Duchenne's dystrophy, patients showed increased cardiac Troponin T (cTnT) but no increased cTnI. In patients with a history of coronary heart disease undergoing chronic hemodialysis, cTnT and cTnI were increased. In different patients with submassive pulmonary embolism, increased cTnI was determined. In coronary artery bypass surgery without perioperative myocardial infarction, patients with extracorporeal circulation showed significantly higher cTnI at 24 h after surgery than those with minimal cardiac surgery. In patients with unstable angina, increased cTnI was found more often than on Stratus analyzer. In conclusion, the new assay is a very sensitive cTnI assay, fast and easy to perform in parallel to enzyme and substrate assays.
