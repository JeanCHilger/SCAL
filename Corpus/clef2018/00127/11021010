Congenital diaphragmatic hernia misdiagnosed as pneumothorax in a newborn. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is usually left sided and has a large defect allowing abdominal viscera herniated into thoracic cavity. The chest films usually show air-filled stomach and/or loops of bowel in the ipsilateral hemithorax with mediastinal shift. We report a newborn with CDH, presenting as hyperlucent hemithorax, right-shifted mediastinum, apparently normal pattern of abdominal bowel gas, with the tip of nasogastric tube below the left hemidiaphragm on the radiograph. It was initially misdiagnosed as pneumothorax, and the acute respiratory distress was temporarily relieved by needle aspiration. Hyperlucent hemithorax due to intrathoracic gastric dilatation alone is an unusual presentation of CDH in neonatal period. Absence of stomach bubble in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, in both radiography and abdominal sonography, is an important clue to make diagnosis of CDH in this misleading condition.
