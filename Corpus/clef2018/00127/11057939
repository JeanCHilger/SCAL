The use of D-dimers in the diagnosis of occult pulmonary emboli in HIV pulmonary disease--two case reports. Pulmonary thromboembolism is not considered a common cause of morbidity in HIV disease. Although anti-phospholipid antibodies are often seen in HIV disease, they are not associated with an increased thrombotic risk. Computed tomographic (CT) pulmonary angiography has been described as the imaging modality of first choice, as abnormal baseline chest X-rays may reduce the diagnostic utility of ventilation perfusion (VIQ) scanning. In HIV-negative individuals D-dimer testing has been shown to be a good screening tool in suspected pulmonary embolism. We present 2 cases where the diagnosis of pulmonary embolus was established using tests for the clotting degradation products D-dimers.
