Preliminary evaluation of two new rapid immunoturbidimetric D-dimer assays in patients with clinically suspected venous thromboembolism (VTE). The practical utility and diagnostic accuracy of two new rapid, automated and quantitative immunoturbidimetric D-dimer methods have been evaluated in a population of 123 randomly selected patients with suspected VTE. The STA Liatest D-dimer and MDA D-dimer methods are based on the photo-optical measurement of the rate of agglutination of antibody-coated latex particles. The VIDAS D-dimer automated Elisa was used as the reference method. Diagnosis was confirmed in 51 patients (29 PE, 19 DVT, 3 DVT+PE). The immunoturbidimetric methods compared favorably with the VIDAS Elisa as judged from the correlation coefficients of linear regression lines (r = 0.82, MDA vs VIDAS r = 0.75, STA vs VIDAS) and areas under the curve of ROC plots (VIDAS 0.83
