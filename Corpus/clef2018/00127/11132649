A new method for measuring D-dimer using immunoturbidometry: a study of 255 patients with suspected pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis. D-Dimer testing has been suggested as a non-invasive method for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). In this study, we compared a new method, the Miniquant D-dimer (Biopool International, Ventura, California, USA) to other previously validated D-dimer methods used for the purpose. Patients who were undergoing a definitive diagnostic study for thromboembolism had a blood sample drawn at that time. A whole-blood D-dimer (SimpliRed Agen Biomedical Ltd, Brisbane, Australia) test was performed, and residual plasma was frozen and later analyzed using two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods (D-dimer Gold
