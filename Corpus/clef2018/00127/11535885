Practical utility of the D-dimer assay for excluding thromboembolism in severely injured trauma patients. We have advocated the use of a D-dimer assay to exclude the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in surgical and trauma patients suspected of having these diagnoses. Injury is known to increase D-dimer levels independent of thromboembolism. The purpose of this study was to assess the period after injury over which the D-dimer assay remains positive because of injury exclusive of thromboembolism.We prospectively sampled the plasma of severely injured patients for D-dimer using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method at admission at hours 8, 16, 24, and 48One hundred fifty-four patients (mean Injury Severity Score of 23) underwent a total of 1,230 D-dimer assays. Twenty-six (17%) had thromboembolism. Nine (6%) patients developed DVT, 2 (1%) developed PE, 13 (8%) developed disseminated intravascular coagulation, and 11 (7%) developed severe adult respiratory distress syndrome. None of the trauma patients with thromboembolism had a (false) negative D-dimer at or after the time of their thromboembolic complication. True-negative D-dimer results as a function of time from injury are: 0 hours, 18% 8 hours, 16%These data serve to validate D-dimer as a means of excluding thromboembolism, specifically in patients with severe injury (100% negative predictive value). Before 48 hours after injury, however, the vast majority of these patients without thromboembolism had positive D-dimer assays. Because of the high false-positive rate early after severe injury, the D-dimer assay may be of little value before postinjury hour 48.
