Antiphospholipid thrombosis syndromes. Antiphospholipid antibodies are strongly associated with thrombosis and are the most common of the acquired blood protein defects causing thrombosis. Although the precise mechanism(s) whereby antiphospholipid antibodies alter hemostasis to induce a hypercoagutable state remain unclear, numerous theories, as previously discussed, have been advanced. The most common thrombotic events associated with anticardiolipin antibodies are deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolus (type I syndrome), coronary or peripheral artery thrombosis (type II syndrome), or cerebrovascular/retinal vessel thrombosis (type II syndrome) occasionally, patients present with mixtures of these types (type IV syndrome). Type V patients are those with antiphospholipid antibodies and RMS. It is as yet unclear how many seemingly normal individuals who may never develop manifestations of antiphospholipid syndrome (type VI) harbor asymptomatic antiphospholipid antibodies. The relative frequency of anticardiolipin antibodies in association with arterial and venous thrombosis strongly suggests that these should be looked for in any individual with unexplained thrombosis
