Percutaneous trans-esophageal gastro-tubing (PTEG): experience of home care with a long-term PTEG. Percutaneous trans-esophageal gastro-tubing (PTEG) was developed as a new method of esophagostomy for drainage and feeding. It is especially easy to create a PTEG for patients in whom it is difficult to perform a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). Here we report a satisfactory experience with a patient with dysphagia for whom we improved the patient's QOL with PTEG. The patient suffered from terrible dysphagia due to Parkinson's disease and was in the postoperative recovery status after undergoing a gastrectomy for gastric cancer. PTEG allowed the patient to receive further long-term medical care at home.The patient was a 74-year-old man with severe dysphagia due to Parkinson's disease and had a residual stomach as a consequence of a gastrectomy. He had to continue receiving long-term enteral nutrition at home, however it was difficult to create a PEG. We therefore decided to use a PTEG.For the PTEG, a rupture-free balloon (RFB) catheter for enteral nutrition was used. First, an RFB was inserted through the nose into the esophagus and inflated. The RFB was punctured percutaneously aided by ultrasonography and conventional fluoroscopy. Then, a guide wire followed by a dilator with a sheath were inserted. Finally, an indwelling catheter was inserted into the digestive tract through the sheath.PTEG using an RFB catheter was a safe, simple and less invasive method it enabled the patient to continue receiving further medical treatment at home without major complications for a long term.
