Semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase in pre-eclampsia: no relation with markers of endothelial cell activation. Semicarbazide sensitive amine-oxidase (SSAO) is an adhesion molecule and thought to play a role in endothelial cell dysfunction (ECD). SSAO has never been associated with markers of ECD. Pre-eclampsia (PE) is, like the early stages of atherosclerosis, characterised by ECD. SSAO could contribute to ECD in PE.Plasma samples were obtained in 14 pre-eclamptic patients and 14 matched controls. In these SSAO-activity, von Willebrand factor (vWF) levels and ED1 fibronectin levels were determined. Placental tissue was collected of 12 pre-eclamptic pregnancies, 8 preterm deliveries and 12 term controls. In these samples, SSAO activity was assessed. In a subset of these placentas, immunohistochemical staining was performed for SSAO, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1.Plasma SSAO activity was not significantly different between pre-eclamptic subjects and controls. VWF and ED1 fibronectin were both significantly increased in the pre-eclamptic subjects. There was no correlation between SSAO activity and vWF or ED1 fibronectin levels. Placental SSAO activity was not different between pre-eclamptic pregnancies, preterm deliveries and term controls. There was strong staining of SSAO in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSM) and moderate staining of trophoblast in all three groups. Endothelial cell expression of SSAO was only seen in term controls and the placentas of pre-eclamptic patients. There was no association between the expression of SSAO, ICAM-1 or VCAM-1 in the placentas of pre-eclamptic patients.SSAO expression and activity are not related to markers of ECD.
