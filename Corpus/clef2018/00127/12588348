Factor VII/VIIa: a new antigen in the anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome. We investigated antibodies to factor VII/VIIa (FVII/VIIa) and five other common target antigens in 33 patients with a history of anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) and 50 healthy controls using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique. We found that antibody to FVII/VIIa, a previously unrecognized and common antigen in APS, was present in 67% of patients. Frequencies of antibodies to other target antigens were: anti-beta-2 glycoprotein 1 (anti-beta 2GP1), 88% anti-cardiolipin (anti-CL), 76%
