Serum levels of heat shock protein 70 in patients with preeclampsia: a pilot-study. To evaluate the serum levels of heat shock protein (Hsp) 70 in patients with severe preeclampsia (PE) in comparison to controls. The pathophysiology of PE can be explained, in part, by alterations of endothelial function caused by endothelial cell activation and injury. HSP 70 is essential for cellular recovery, survival and maintenance of homeostasis.In a matched pair study, serum levels of Hsp 70 were measured in 55 patients with late (group A, n = 24) and early (group B, n = 31) onset of severe PE, and in 55 normotensive controls (group C, n = 24 and group D, n = 31) matched for gestational age. Early onset of severe PE was defined as onset of disease at less than 34 weeks of gestation (34 + 0). Serum levels were determined using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.The overall median serum levels of Hsp 70 were 2.82 ng/mL (SD +/- 8.33) in preeclamptic women, and 1.01 (SD +/- 1.38) ng/mL in controls (P = 0.08). The median serum levels of Hsp 70 were 0.52 ng/mL (SD +/- 1.14) in group A and 0.86 (SD +/- 1.29) ng/mL in group C (P = 0.15). The median serum levels of Hsp 70 were 4.94 ng/mL (SD +/- 10.46) in group B and 1.33 (SD +/- 2.28) ng/mL (P = 0.04) in group D. The difference between group A and B was also statistically significant (P = 0.01).Our study revealed higher serum levels of Hsp 70 in patients with early onset of severe PE. Further studies are recommended in order to elucidate the possible role of Hsp 70 in the pathophysiology of PE.
