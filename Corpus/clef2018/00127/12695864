Transient small-bowel intussusception in children on CT. To determine the frequency and significance of small-bowel intussusception identified in children on CT.All abdomen CT reports between July 1995 and April 2002 were reviewed to identify patients with small-bowel intussusception. Intussusceptions were identified as an intraluminal mass with a characteristic layered appearance and/or continuity with adjacent mesenteric fat. Ileocolic intussusceptions and intussusceptions related to feeding tubes were excluded. Imaging studies and medical records were reviewed.Twenty-five pediatric patients (16 boys, 9 girls mean age 11.2 years) were identified with small-bowel intussusception on CT. No patient had a persistent intussusception requiring surgery. Fourteen had limited immediate repeat CT images as part of the same examination, ten of which demonstrated resolution of the CT abnormality. Follow-up CT [ n=13 (6 within 24 h)], ultrasound ( n=3), small-bowel follow-through ( n=4) and surgery ( n=3) showed no intussusception. In four patients with persistent symptoms, underlying pathology was identified requiring treatment (giardiasis, 2Most small-bowel intussusceptions identified in children by CT are transient and of no clinical significance.
