Small bowel obstruction in an adolescent with pelvic inflammatory disease due to Chlamydia trachomatis. A 19-yr-old adolescent, who was hospitalized because of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) due to Chlamydia trachomatis, developed bile-stained emesis. A mild amount of free fluid in the pelvis was found on abdominal ultrasound but there was no sonographic evidence of a pelvic mass or of a tubo-ovarian abscess. Plain radiography and computer tomography (with contrast) of the abdomen revealed a high-grade partial small bowel obstruction. Conservative treatment, which included intravenous fluids and antibiotics together with continuous bowel decompression via nasogastric tube, led to resolution of the small bowel obstruction within 2 days and to resumption of oral feeding within 4 days of treatment. Follow-up for 6 months after this episode was uneventful. The present case calls for inclusion of plain radiography of the abdomen in the evaluation of PID associated with emesis. It also suggests that, in a clinically stable patient diagnosed with small bowel obstruction associated with PID, conservative treatment could be attempted before any operative intervention is considered.
