Decreased plasma neurohormones and improved cardiac performance after surgical treatment of chronic pulmonary embolism. The findings of this case report suggest that quantitative assessment of plasma neurohormones and magnetic resonance imaging functional parameters in patients with right ventricular pressure overload due to chronic pulmonary embolism might be used as indicators for right ventricular function before and after intervention. Monitoring of changes in these parameters may provide quantitative follow-up of right ventricular function in these patients.
