Pulmonary embolism in very old patients. Diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) in the elderly remains difficult and is often late, although its incidence increases steadily with age. Since few studies have reported the clinical picture of this disease in very old patients, the aim of our study was to focus on clinical, instrumental and laboratory aspects in patients 75 years of age and over with suspected PE.Symptoms, signs, risk factors for venous thromboembolic diseases, 12-lead electrocardiograms, B-mode echocardiograms, chest X-rays, leg compression venous ultrasonography, latex-assay quantitative D-dimer, and arterial blood gas analyses were collected for 96 elderly patients of 75 years and over (mean age 81.22 +/- 4.81) with suspected PE, admitted to our acute geriatric ward from 1997 to 2000. Patients were divided into two groups: 59 patients with PE (PE+) confirmed by pulmonary angiography, scintigraphic lung scan or necropsy, and 37 patients with normal lung scan or without PE at necropsy (PE-).Dyspnea and chest pain were the most common symptoms in both groups, but significantly more frequent in the PE+ group. Tachycardia, fever, cyanosis, and tachypnea were the most common objective signs in both groups tachycardia and tachypnea were not significantly different between the two groups. Bed rest, venous insufficiency and leg deep vein thrombosis were the most common venous risk factors in PE+ and significantly different with respect to PE-. Sinus tachycardia, ST-T abnormalities and right bundle branch block were the most common electrocardiographic aspects in PE+Although many analyzed clinical, instrumental and laboratory aspects were significantly more frequent in the PE+ group, they were all non-specific and not conclusive for diagnosis of PE. Our retrospective study focus may add information about the picture and diagnostic difficulties of PE in very old patients.
