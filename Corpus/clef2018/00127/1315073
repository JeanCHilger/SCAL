The changes in molecular markers for hemostatic activation after t-PA therapy in case of pulmonary embolism. We observed the changes of molecular markers for hemostatic activation in a patient with acute pulmonary embolism treated with 2 x 10(7) unit tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). Blood samples were obtained before, just after, at 30 min, 1, 2, 6, and 24 hours after the infusion. Molecular markers included thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT), plasminogen-alpha 2 plasmin inhibitor complex (PIC), and thrombomodulin (TM). Marked elevation of TAT was observed from immediately after the t-PA infusion to 6 hours after, although it had been observed for only 1 hour in our previous report on the cases of acute myocardial infarction. PIC level was significantly increased during t-PA infusion but returned to almost baseline value 6 hours after the end of t-PA infusion. This finding was almost the same as the one previously reported concerning acute myocardial infarction cases. TM level increased throughout the evaluation, and remained so, even on the 7th day after t-PA infusion. Our present data revealed a clear difference between the reactive TAT increases after t-PA therapy in acute myocardial infarction cases and in acute pulmonary embolism cases. Our present data also revealed a prolonged elevation of TM during the acute period of pulmonary embolism. It is therefore necessary to keep an eye on the changes of molecular markers for hemostatic activation after t-PA therapy in acute pulmonary embolism.
