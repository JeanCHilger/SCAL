In vivo and in vitro effects of thrombin and plasmin on human factor VIII (AHF). The relationship between factor VIII (AHF) procoagulant activity and factor VIII-related antigen were examined in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), pulmonary embolism (PE), and coronary artery disease with or without myocardial infarction (MI). It was found that 13 of 13 patients with DIC, 17 of 17 patients with PE, and 10 of 12 patients with MI possessed a significantly elevated factor VIII-related antigen to factor VIII activity ratio (VIII-ratio). The VIII-ratio returned to normal in each of 2 patients with DIC and 1 paitent with PE after treatment with heparin, heparin and alpha-amino-caproic acid, and heparin and coumadin respectively. In contrast, the VIII-ratio was slightly elevated only in 1 of 15 patients with coronary artery insufficiency without MI. In in vitro studies, after treatment of plasma with thrombin or plasmin, factor VIII activity was lost, whereas the amount of factor VIII-related antigen remained the same or was even increased when measured by agarose quantitative immunoelectrophoresis. These observations have led us to conclude that an elevated VIII-ratio is a very sensitive indicator of intravascular coagulation.
