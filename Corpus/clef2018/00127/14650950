Misdiagnosis of pulmonary embolism in patients with allergic reaction--the importance of prior probability of disease. Because pulmonary embolism (PE) and its treatment carry substantial risk of morbidity and mortality, accurate diagnosis is essential. We report two cases with allergic reactions, in which PE was suggested by routine ECG and D-dimer elevation and strengthened by spiral CT. Therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin was initiated and long-term anticoagulation was considered. As their histories did not reveal any predisposing factor to PE, the cases were re-evaluated. Elevation of D-dimer was now attributed to allergic reaction, ECG abnormalities were considered as constitutional, and findings from spiral CT attributed to breathing artifacts and partial-volume effects. The diagnosis of PE was therefore rejected and anticoagulant treatment discontinued without sequelae. These cases show the importance of determining clinical probability before ordering further diagnostic tests and critical interpretation of test results suggestive of PE, based on prior probability of the disease.
