Plasma D-dimer for the diagnosis of thromboembolic disorders in dogs. D-dimer is formed during thrombus formation when factor XIIIa crosslinks the terminal D-domains of fibrin. The D-dimer epitope is exposed when the thrombus is lysed by plasmin. Thus, D-dimer represents both thrombin and plasmin activation and is specific for fibrinolysis. D-dimer concentrations are increased in dogs with DIC or other thromboembolic disorders, but because D-dimer is an indicator of physiologic or pathologic fibrinolysis, values are elevated in other conditions associated with fibrinolysis, including orthopedic surgery, neoplasia, and internal hemorrhage. It can be used as an ancillary test for the diagnosis of DIC but is not recommended as a sole test for this purpose. D-dimer has the potential to be a useful laboratory test for the detection of pulmonary thromboembolism in dogs. Further studies are needed to determine the appropriate applications for this test in veterinary patients to aid in clinical decision making, treatment, and patient care.
