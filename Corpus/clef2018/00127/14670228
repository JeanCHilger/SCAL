Interaction of the water-soluble protein aprotinin with liposomes: gel-filtration, turbidity studies, and 31P NMR studies. The interactions of a water-soluble nonmembrane protein aprotinin with multilamellar vesicles (MLV) and small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) from soybean phospholipids were studied using Sephadex G-75 gel chromatography combined with different methods of the analysis of the eluate fractions (fluorescence, light-scattering, turbidity 31P NMR spectroscopy). The composition of the liposomes mainly containing soybean phosphatidylcholine (PC) was varied by the addition of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI) and lyso-phosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC). To evaluate the lipid-protein interactions, the amount of aprotinin in the MLV-aprotinin complexes was determined. Lipid-protein interactions were found to strongly depend on the liposome composition, medium pH and ionic strength. These dependencies point to the electrostatic nature of the aprotinin-lipid interactions. 31P NMR spectroscopy of the MLV-aprotinin complexes indicated that aprotinin influences the phospholipid structure in MLV at pH 3.0. In the case of PC:PE:PI and PC:PE:PI:lyso-PC vesicles, aprotinin induced liposome aggregation and a lamellar-to-isotropic phase transition of the phospholipids.
