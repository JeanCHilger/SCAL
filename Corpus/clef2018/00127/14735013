Malignant fibrous histiocytoma of the stomach. MFH is a kind of sarcoma, normally located in the soft tissues of the extremity and retroperitoneal space. The involvment of the gastroenteric tube and particularly of the stomach are rather rare. Our case shows some differences from the others described in literature: the sight of mass, the age of the patient, the extension at the moment of the diagnosis.
