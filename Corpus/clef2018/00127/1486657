Dextran sulfate-dependent fusion of liposomes containing cationic stearylamine. The incorporation of the positively charged stearylamine into phosphatidylcholine liposomes was studied by measuring electrophoretic mobilities. Up to a molar ratio SA/PC = 0.5 an increase of the positive zeta potential can be observed. Addition of the negatively charged macromolecule dextran sulfate leads to a change of the sign of the surface potential of the PC/SA liposomes indicating binding of the macromolecule to the surface. This process is accompanied by an increase in turbidity, which is dependent on the molecular weight of the dextran sulfate and the SA concentration (measured by turbidimetry). Using the NBD/Rh and Pyr-PC fluorescence assays the fusion of SA containing liposomes was investigated. A strong influence of the SA content and molecular weight of dextran sulfate on the fusion extent was observed. The fusion extent is proportional to the SA content in the PC membrane and the molecular weight of dextran sulfate. PC/SA/PE liposomes exhibit a higher fusion extent after addition of dextran sulfate compared to PC/SA liposomes indicating that PE additionally destabilizes the bilayer. Freeze-fracture electron microscopy reveals that the reaction products are large complexes composed of multilamellar stacks of tightly packed, straight membranes and aggregated vesicles. The tight packing of the membranes in the stacks (and the narrow contact of the aggregated vesicles) indicates a strong adherence of opposite membrane surfaces induced by dextran sulfate.
