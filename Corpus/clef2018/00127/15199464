Oral anticoagulant therapy in venous thromboembolism. The main objective of treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the prevention of the extension, embolization, and recurrence of thrombosis. The long-term aim is to prevent late recurrences and the post-thrombotic syndrome. Heparin and oral anticoagulants (OACs) have been the cornerstones of VTE treatment in the last 30 years. Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) have been introduced more recently in the treatment of the acute phase of VTE, and they have allowed the home treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in selected cases. The optimal duration of OAC therapy after VTE is still controversial. Several studies have been conducted, and several are ongoing with the aim to stratify patients into risk categories for recurrence. Patients at high risk are candidates for long-term oral anticoagulation as the benefits of extended oral anticoagulation would outweigh the risk of bleeding. Patients are currently stratified into risk categories on the basis of clinical characteristics of the VTE event: (1) first or recurrent event (2) idiopathic or due to a transient risk factor such as surgery, trauma, hormonal therapy, or immobilization
