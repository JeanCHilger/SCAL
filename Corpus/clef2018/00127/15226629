Hepatocyte growth factor and cardiovascular thrombosis in patients admitted to the intensive care unit. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) has been reported as a marker of atherosclerosis and of thrombi synthesis, but the relationship between HGF and proven coronary thrombi has not been described. The aim of this study was to investigate this relationship in patients with chest pain.The study group comprised 107 patients with chest pain (61 acute myocardial infarction (AMI), 18 unstable angina, 15 stable angina, and 13 others 65 males, 42 femalesIncreased serum HGF concentrations correlate with the presence of thrombi in patients with acute coronary syndrome, acute aortic dissection, and pulmonary thromboembolism.
