Low molecular weight heparin (dalteparin) is equally effective as unfractionated heparin in reducing coagulation activity and perfusion abnormalities during the early treatment of pulmonary embolism. Little is known about the differences between unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) with regard to their effects on coagulation activity during treatment for pulmonary embolism. The objective of this study was to compare UFH and LMWH (dalteparin) in the early treatment of pulmonary embolism in terms of control of coagulation markers and perfusion abnormalities. Thirty-seven patients with acute pulmonary embolism were randomized to receive intravenous UFH or subcutaneous dalteparin, each accompanied by acenocoumarol. Daily blood samples were obtained for the measurement of thrombin generation (fragments 1 and 2 [F1+2], thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complexes and fibrin monomers [FMs]) and fibrinolysis (d-dimer concentrations and clot-lysis times). Ventilation-perfusion scintigraphies were performed, and with the data they yielded, percentage of vascular obstruction scores (PVOs) were calculated on days 0 and 5. The international normalized ratio was within the therapeutic range in both groups on day 3. F1+2 and TAT complexes rapidly normalized, without differences between the groups (P =.5 and.4, respectively). FM levels did not decrease and, in fact, showed an increase in the UFH group from day 3 on (P <.05 between groups). d-Dimer levels decreased over time, with no differences between groups (P =.6). Clot-lysis times were shorter in the UFH group (P <.05). PVOs on days 0 and 5 were not different (P =.5 and.8, respectively), but the decrease in PVOs over time was greater in the dalteparin group (P =.04). These results show that dalteparin is at least as effective as UFH in reducing coagulation activity and perfusion abnormalities in the early treatment of pulmonary embolism.
