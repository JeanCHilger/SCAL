Outcomes after pylorus-preserving gastrectomy for early gastric cancer: a prospective multicenter trial. The aim of the present study was to compare in a prospective, multicenter trial the results early and late after pylorus-preserving gastrectomy (PPG) versus conventional distal gastrectomy (CDG) with Billroth I anastomosis for early gastric cancer. Eighty-one patients with early gastric cancer were randomized and then underwent either PPG or CDG. Duration of operation, intraoperative blood loss, days until removal of the nasogastric tube, days until start of oral intake, and decrease in body weight were studied as parameters for outcomes early after the surgery. Late results were studied in patients followed for longer than 3 years. Change in body weight, status of oral intake, symptoms suggesting early dumping syndrome, and overall satisfaction were addressed in the questionnaire. The presence of gallstones was examined with ultrasonography. There were no differences in early results between PPG and CDG. The incidence of early dumping syndrome was lower in PPG (8%) than in CDG (33%). Other late results including the incidence of gallstones were not different between the 2 groups. These results indicate that PPG is as safe as CDG and has an advantage in terms of early dumping syndrome.
