The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism: the best strategies according to the results of a large Dutch multicentre study. The Dutch national guidelines for the diagnosis of patients with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism (from 1992 en 1998) are poorly followed in clinical practice, due especially to practical objections. A large multicentre trial to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of the available modalities and of recently developed techniques such as D-dimer determination, (99m)Tc-gas-scintigraphy and spiral CT scanning was started in I997. In the first phase, the diagnostic value was assessed of: spiral CT (sensitivity 69%, specificity 84% sensitivity for segmental and larger pulmonary embolisms (PE) 86% and for subsegmental PE 21%), (99m)Tc-gas-ventilation scintigraphy (no improvement compared to conventional ventilation scintigraphy), D-dimer determination (sensitivity for segmental PE 93% and for subsegmental PE 53%, specificity 63%), clinical decision rules (in combination with D-dimer determination
