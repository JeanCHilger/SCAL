Metoclopramide improves gastric but not gallbladder emptying in cardiac surgery patients with early intragastric enteral feeding: randomized controlled trial. To evaluate the effect of metoclopramide on gastric emptying in coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery patients with early enteral nutrition and to evaluate the effect of metoclopramide on motility of the gallbladder in these patients.A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of 40 patients treated at cardiosurgical intensive care unit after CABG surgery. The patients were divided into two groups: metoclopramide group (20 patients age 60-/+9 yearsThe plasma paracetamol concentrations 15, 30, 60, and 120 minutes after the administration of paracetamol were significantly higher in metoclopramide group than in control group: (t(+15)) 5.4-/+2.7 vs 3.3-/+2.5 (Mann-Whitney U test P=0.017)In CABG surgery patients with early enteral feeding, a single dose of intravenous metoclopramide effectively improves gastric emptying, but does not have any prokinetic effect on gallbladder motility.
