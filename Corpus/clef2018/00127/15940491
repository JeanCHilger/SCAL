Management of pulmonary embolism. Venous thromboembolism is often triggered by transient episodes of increased risk but may occur spontaneously in patients with permanently increased risk. Pulmonary embolism may cause impairment of respiratory and circulatory function which can vary in severity from silent to catastrophic. The diagnosis can be feasibly established by detecting vein thrombosis. If this approach fails, demonstration of pulmonary emboli by lung scans becomes necessary to establish the diagnosis. A D-dimer-test can select patients in whom imaging of pulmonary perfusion is required. Immediate therapeutic anticoagulation with heparins is mandatory in confirmed thromboembolism, and is followed by a vitamin K antagonist. In the initial work-up, patients also have to be evaluated for systemic thrombolytic therapy by hemodynamic parameters and echocardiography. In a triggered episode of venous thromboembolism, duration of anticoagulation is confined to several months while spontaneous or recurrent events require prolonged or indefinite treatment.
