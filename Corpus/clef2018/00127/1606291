Fibrinolysis and fibrinogenolysis in patients with thrombotic disease. In order to assess the fibrinolytic state in thrombotic disease, plasma levels of fibrin degradation products (FbDP) and fibrinogen degradation products (FgDP) were measured in 126 patients with a variety of thrombotic diseases. Mean plasma concentrations of both FbDP and FgDP were significantly elevated in patients with thrombotic disease as compared with healthy subjects. Plasma concentrations of FgDP were positively correlated with FbDP (r = 0.667, P less than 0.001). When analysed according to the disease categories, the magnitude of elevations of FbDP and FgDP was most prominent in venous thrombotic disease such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. These findings indicate that fibrinolysis is accelerated in patients with thrombotic disease and that fibrinolysis is frequently accompanied by some fibrinogenolysis in these patients.
