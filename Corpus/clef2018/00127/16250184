Variation in the plasma concentration of B-type natriuretic peptide in emergent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, in acute pulmonary embolism, in acute coronary syndrome and in dilated cardiomyopathy. Our research is based on the critical evaluation of plasma concentration variation of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)--in emergency--in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, acute pulmonary edema, acute coronary syndrome and dilated cardiomyopathy. The aim of our research was to assess if the BNP concentration variation may be useful in the diagnosis and therapy. Peptide synthesis takes place mainly in the ventricular myocardium. We selected 102 patients: 27 control subjects, and 75 admitted to the emergency and reception department for dyspnea and/or precordialgia and/or palpitations. At the beginning they were considered as one group only, and then they were divided into groups according to the diagnosis: 20 with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with reversion to sinus rhythm in the first week 20 with acute pulmonary edema
