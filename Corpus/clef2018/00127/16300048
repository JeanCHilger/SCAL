Cytokine profile of a human bone marrow cell culture under the influence of UHMW-PE wear particles. There is considerable evidence that orthopaedic wear debris plays a crucial role in the pathology of aseptic loosening of joint prostheses. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the influence of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMW-PE) on the cytokine response in a modified in vitro model. UHMW-PE particles (psi < 7.5 microm) were suspended in soluble collagen type I and subsequently solidified in different concentrations (105,106 and 107 particles per well) on the bottom of the wells. Human bone marrow cells in a concentration of 3 x 106 cells per well were seeded on the collagen-particle substrata and maintained for up to 12 days. The cytokine response (IL-1_, IL-6 and TNF-_) of the cells to the particles were examined by ELISA compared to cells on control collagen surfaces without any particles. Assays for viability using LDH activity were done immediately. Light and scanning microscopic evaluation revealed that the UHMWPE particles, which have built large conglomerates (psi7.5_m), were mainly surrounded by the cells and less phagocytosed. The results of the cytokine release revealed significant differences in interleukin (IL)6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- _ and IL-1beta. The cell viability was not affected by the UHMW-PE particles. The results demonstrate that the particle induced cytokine response by UHMW-PE is mainly by the release of Interleukin 6 and TNF- _. Moreover the results confirm that the present method is useful to evaluate the in vitro effects of UHMW-PE wear particles with direct particle cell contact.
