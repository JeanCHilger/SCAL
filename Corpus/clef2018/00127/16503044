The prognosis of pulmonary embolism: are there practical implications for patient management?. There is growing evidence that outpatient treatment is safe and effective for many patients with non-massive pulmonary embolism. Despite this evidence, the vast majority of patients with non-massive pulmonary embolism continue to be treated in an inpatient setting. A major barrier to outpatient treatment has been the lack of explicit criteria to identify patients with pulmonary embolism at low-risk of adverse medical outcome. This article discusses new risk stratification tools for pulmonary embolism such as echocardiography, biomarkers, and clinical prognostic scores, and their potential application for patient management.
