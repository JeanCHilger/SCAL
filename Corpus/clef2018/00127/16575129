Dynamics of paranasal sinus and tympanic membrane changes in prolongely intubated patients. 67 prolongely intubated patients from intensive care unit were under our observation. Were performed ultrasound examination and CT scan of paranasal sinuses in prolongely intubated patients. In the same patients it was performed the examination of tympanic cavity by acoustic impendansometry. Also was performed bacteriologic examination of nasal discharge in prolongely intubated patients. Our investigations showed, that in prolongely intubated patients there is a high risk of development of polysinusitis and evstachitis, which can lead to so called fever of unknown origin and even to chronic sepsis. According to the authors, sanitation of nasal cavity must be performed every day at least 1 time, and if there is the shade--at least 2 times every day. To create the negative pressure, it is rational to use iamic--catheter and, through which activation of mucocilliary transport is performed. Changing of nasogastral probe is rational after one day by turns in each nasal pass. It is rational to cleanse places of pressing of these probes with the antiseptic solutions.
