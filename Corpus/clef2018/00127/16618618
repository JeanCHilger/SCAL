Jejunojejunal intussusception following jejunostomy. Jejunojejunal intussusception is a rare complication of jejunostomy, and its preoperative diagnosis and surgical treatment have not been reported. A 78-year-old man suffered from vomiting off and on after emergency exploratory laparotomy with omentoplasty for perforated duodenal ulcer. He also received Witzel jejunostomy for early feeding. Ileus developed postoperatively and plain X-ray of the abdomen showed distended small bowel loop with scanty colon gas. Small bowel series performed with water-soluble contrast medium revealed substantial fluid retention in the stomach, duodenum and proximal jejunum. Infusion of contrast medium into the feeding tube revealed normal caliber of the distal small bowel. Abdominal sonogram revealed target sign as well as the feeding tube in a dilated jejunum. Abdominal computed tomography confirmed the sonographic impression of jejunojejunal intussusception. Reduction of intussusception was done during exploratory laparotomy. The jejunostomy feeding was continued and the postoperative course was uneventful.
