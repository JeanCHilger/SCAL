Current approaches and controversial issues in the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis via duplex Doppler ultrasound. Duplex and color Doppler sonography (DUS) is currently the technique of choice for the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in symptomatic patients, because it has proven safe and cost-effective, with a very high sensitivity and specificity (96% and 98%, respectively) for the diagnosis of proximal DVT. Several issues regarding its method and clinical indications remain controversial, however. Although isolated calf vein thrombosis does not seem to have a significant adverse outcome in the short term, scanning the calf only in patients with localized symptoms or signs is cost-effective. Bilateral examination is indicated in high-risk patients or when screening asymptomatic patients. When negative, a complete DUS examination of the proximal and distal veins, at least down to the level of the popliteal trifurcation, allows withholding anticoagulant therapy without the risk of major complications. This examination may be repeated if signs or symptoms worsen. Some populations of asymptomatic patients at high risk of DVT may benefit from DUS screening. Bilateral DUS examination of lower limb veins should be performed as the initial examination in the workflow of pulmonary embolism only in patients with risk factors for DVT. Recurrent thrombosis is a challenging diagnosis for all imaging modalities. A diagnostic strategy combining clinical probability score and D-dimer test may refine the selection of patients. The pitfalls and limitations of venous DUS are related to vein anatomy, flow changes, technical issues, and operator expertise.
