Abnormally short activated partial thromboplastin time values are associated with increased risk of recurrence of venous thromboembolism after oral anticoagulation withdrawal. This study prospectively evaluated the relationship between activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) recurrence after oral anticoagulant (OA) withdrawal in patients with a previous unprovoked VTE event. Six hundred twenty-eight patients (331 males median age: 67 years) were followed after OA interruption (mean follow-up = 22 months). Three to four weeks from OA discontinuation patients were given a complete thrombophilic work-out, including aPTT (automated aPTT). Recurrent symptomatic VTE events (objectively documented) occurred in 71/628 (11.3%, 6.8/100 person-years) patients. The VTE recurrence rate was 17.5% and 7.5% in patients with aPTT in the lower (ratio < or =0.90) and in the upper (ratio >1.05) quartiles. The recurrence risk was more than twofold higher in patients with ratio < or =0.90 versus those of the reference category [Relative risk (RR): 2.38 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.18-4.78)]. As expected, the increase in recurrence risk disappeared after adjustment for factor VIII, IX and XI levels [RR: 1.74 (95%CI: 0.43-2.76)]. In contrast, the risk was persistently increased in patients with a ratio < or =0.90 [RR: 2.07 (95%CI: 1.02-4.18)] after adjustment for age, gender and d-dimer level. The aPTT predictive value was independent of the presence of inherited thrombophilic alterations. In conclusion, abnormally short aPTT values are associated with a significantly increased risk of VTE recurrence.
