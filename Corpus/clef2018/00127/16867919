Serum adiponectin concentration prior to clinical onset of preeclampsia. This study assesses whether the adipokine adiponectin is a useful marker in pregnant women who subsequently develop preeclampsia (PE).A retrospective case-control study was conducted to measure the total serum levels of adiponectin, measured by radioimmunoassay kit, in serum samples stored in serological biobanks.Total serum adiponectin concentrations between the groups were not significantly different (p = 0.22). There were no obvious clinical signs of the preeclamptic inflammatory process at the time when samples were drawn.Using this design, total adiponectin appeared not be a useful pre-clinical marker of PE.
