Preoperative serum fibrinogen as a predictor of myocardial infarction in the surgical myocardial revascularization. Determine the predictive level of preoperative serum fibrinogen level for the occurrence of MI in perioperative surgical myocardial revascularization (SMR), as well as for other impacting outcomes, such as stroke, pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE), and death, separately or in combination.A retrospective cohort study based on the heart surgery database analysis from SÃ£o Lucas Hospital, at Rio Grande do Sul Catholic University with 1,471 consecutive patients submitted to extracorporeal SMR between January, 1998 and December, 2002.Perioperative MI occurred in 14% of sample patients. No association was shown between preoperative fibrinogen and perioperative MI (410.60 +/- 148.83 mg/dl for the study group x 401.57 +/- 135.23 mg/dl for control group--p = 0.381--RC = 1.000--CI95%: 0.998-1.002--p = 0.652), combined outcome for MI, stroke, PTE, and death (411.40 +/- 153.52 mg/dL for the group reporting outcome x 400.31 +/- 131.98 mg/dL for the group with no outcome--p = 0.232) and neither separately.In that sample, preoperative serum fibrinogen level did not show any association with the occurrence of perioperative MI in SMR, neither with other impacting outcomes, stroke, PTE, and mortality, whether separately or as composite endpoints.
