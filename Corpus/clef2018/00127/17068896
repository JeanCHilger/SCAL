Esophageal atresia and situs inversus--an unusual association of abnormalities--a case report. We present a case report of a neonate with esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula. In the 31st week of gestation, maternal polyhydramnions was observed by prenatal ultrasonography. Postnatal insertion of an orogastric tube into the stomach was unsuccessful. On auscultation, the apex of the heart was heard at the right side of the thorax, while the liver was palpable 1 cm below the left rib cage. Esophageal atresia with tracheoesphageal fistula and situs inversus of the thoracic and abdominal organs was diagnosed During the first day of life, left transpleural thoracotomy was performed. The fistula was closed and esophageal anastomosis performed. One year after the operation the child had no difficulties when eating solid and liquid foods. More than 50% of infants with esophageal atresia have associated anomalies and the esophagogram showed good passage of contrast with anastomotic stricture. This was the first report of esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula repair in a patient with situs inversus treated in our Clinic.
