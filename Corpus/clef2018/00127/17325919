Percutaneous radiologic gastrostomy with a simplified gastropexy technique under ultrasonographic and fluoroscopic guidance: experience in 154 patients. To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of percutaneous radiologic gastrostomy (PRG) under ultrasonographic (US) and fluoroscopic guidance using a simplified gastropexy technique.One hundred and fifty-four (154) patients (mean age 73, range 22-93 years) were referred for PRG. Indication for PRG was neurologic disease, head/neck cancer, and other disease in 73%, 15%, and 12%, respectively. Initially, the stomach was filled with 300-500 cm3 of tap water via a nasogastric tube. The fluid-filled stomach was punctured under US guidance. A guidewire and a single T-fastener were introduced. Under fluoroscopic guidance, the tract was dilated over the guidewire until a 16F dilator with a peel-away sheath could be introduced. During dilatation, the external suture string to the T-fastener was held tight to fixate the gastric wall. A 14F balloon-retained gastrostomy tube was introduced and inflated. The T-fastener was then released, and the gastrostomy tube was retracted gently to affix the gastric wall to the abdominal wall (tube gastropexy). Technical success was assured by aspiration of gastric fluid and fluoroscopically by injection of a water-soluble contrast medium.The primary technical success rate was 98%. At 30-day follow-up, 3.2% had major complications and 14% minor complications. Three patients (1.9%) died of complications related to the procedure. Thirteen cases (8%) of simple tube displacement without other complications occurred.PRG guided by US and fluoroscopy is a relatively safe technique with a high success rate, provided the stomach can be properly distended with fluid. However, tube gastropexy alone does not seem to protect against early dislodgement.
