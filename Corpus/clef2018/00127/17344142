B-type natriuretic hormone--diagnostic and prognostic cardiovascular biomarker. Brain natriuretic hormone and N-terminal-probrain natriuretic hormone are equally important cardiovascular biomarkers. Moderately increased brain natriuretic hormone level is a reliable predictor of preclinical, asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. Low brain natriuretic hormone levels are extensively used to rule out acute heart failure. Increased brain natriuretic hormone is associated to age, left ventricular hypertrophy, left atrial volume, atrial fibrillation, myocardial ischemia, renal failure, pulmonary hypertension, acute pulmonary embolism and progressive aortic stenosis. In chronic heart failure only high brain natriuretic hormone values support the diagnosis. High brain natriuretic hormone level, however, is an important overall cardiovascular prognostic biomarker. In the near future brain natriuretic hormone appears to be an interesting new therapeutic modality.
