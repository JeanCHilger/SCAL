Reduced plasma adiponectin and elevated leptin in pre-eclampsia. To clarify the role of adipocytokine, adiponectin, and leptin in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia (PE) and determine the relationships between plasma adiponectin and leptin levels.A total of 73 women in the third trimester of pregnancy were recruited, 53 women with PE (study patients) and 20 age- and BMI-matched normotensive women (healthy controls). They were divided into 3 groups: the 20 normotensive pregnant women (group 1) 32 women with mild pre-eclampsia (group 2)Compared with controls, levels of adiponectin were significantly lower in women with mild or severe PE (P<0.01 for both groups) whereas levels of leptin were significantly higher in women with mild or severe PE (P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively). There was a negative correlation between plasma levels of adiponectin and leptin in pre-eclamptic women (r=-0.76, P<0.01). Moreover, the adiponectin level to leptin level ratio was significantly lower in pre-eclamptic women than that in healthy controls (P<0.01). In the pre-eclamptic women serum levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly increased (P<0.01 for all), while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was significantly decreased compared to levels in normotensive pregnant women (P<0.01).These findings suggest that there is an imbalance between adiponectin and leptin in the plasma of pre-eclamptic women. Reduced adiponectin and elevated leptin levels may be involved in the pathogenesis of PE and associated with the development of severe disease.
