Pulmonary thromboembolism in neurosurgical patients. Part 2. Estimation of the informative value of determination of fibrinogen D-dimer levels in the preoperative period. The paper presents the results of clinical evaluation of the informative value of determination of blood fibrinogen D-dimer in 177 neurosurgical patients undergoing intracranial interventions for brain tumors. Screening detection of patients at high risk for thromboembolic complications is based on the determination of the blood levels of D-dimer on the first day after admission. To verify the diagnostic informative value of D-dimer determination, the patients with higher values (0.5+/-0.03 ng/l) underwent ultrasound scanning of lower extremity veins within the following 1-2 days. Despite its preliminary nature, the study showed the predictive value of determination of blood D-dimer levels in neurosurgical patients in the preoperative period and in the screening of prethrombotic events.
