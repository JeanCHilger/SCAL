Value of ischemia-modified albumin in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common condition, but the diagnostic strategy for the evaluation of suspected PE is somewhat controversial. Despite the use of various biochemical markers (such as D-dimer and C-reactive protein) and various probability calculation algorithms based on clinical findings for that purpose, there is still a need for more specific and practical markers in PE diagnosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic value of ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) levels in the diagnosis of PE.This case-control study was performed in the emergency department between March and September 2006. The serum IMA levels of a total of 60 individuals, consisting of 30 PE patients who had been definitively diagnosed via spiral computed tomographic angiography and 30 healthy volunteers, were examined.The measurement of IMA levels in patient plasma yielded mean values of 0.724 +/- 0.122 absorbance unit (ABSU) in the PE group and 0.360 +/- 0.090 ABSU in the control group. When plasma IMA levels in the PE group were compared with those in the control group, statistically significant increases in IMA were observed in the former (t = 13.19, df = 56, P < .0005). The value of 0.540 ABSU was calculated as the upper limit of reference interval. In the PE group, 97.7% (n = 29) had values exceeding 0.540 ABSU none of the control subjects had values exceeding this cutoff value.In conclusion, our data suggest that IMA levels may be useful as a discriminative marker to exclude pulmonary embolism.
