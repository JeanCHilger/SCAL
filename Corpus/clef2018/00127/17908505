Construction and primary application of two HBV-HLA-A*2402-peptide tetramers. To construct two soluble HLA-A*2402-peptide tetramers and detect the HBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) with the constructed HLA-A*2402-peptide tetramers.After proteins HLA-A*2402-BSP and beta2m were made an effective prokanyotical expression, the purified proteins were refolded into HLA-A*2402-beta2m-peptide complexes in the presence of two antigenic peptides (Hepatitis B virus Pol756-764 or Core117-125) with dilution method. Then the complexes were biotinylated by BirA enzyme and purified by gel-filtration chromatography. The tetramers were generated by mixing the complex with PE-Streptavidin in the molar ratio of 5:1. FCM can and cell quest software were used to analyze the stained PBMCs.Two biotinylated HBV-HLA-A*2402-peptide complexes were identified by Western blot and they were shown to have natural conformation by Dot-ELISA and ELISA.The constructed HLA-A*2402-peptide tetramers can detect the HBV-specific CTLs in the patients with self-limited acute HBV infection.
