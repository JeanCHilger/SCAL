A longitudinal study of angiogenic (placental growth factor) and anti-angiogenic (soluble endoglin and soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1) factors in normal pregnancy and patients destined to develop preeclampsia and deliver a small for gestational age neonate. Accumulating evidence suggests that an imbalance between pro-angiogenic (i.e., vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and placental growth factor (PlGF)) and anti-angiogenic factors (i.e., soluble VEGF receptor-1 (sVEGFR-1, also referred to as sFlt1)) is involved in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia (PE). Endoglin is a protein that regulates the pro-angiogenic effects of transforming growth factor beta, and its soluble form has recently been implicated in the pathophysiology of PE. The objective of this study was to determine if changes in maternal plasma concentration of these angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors differ prior to development of disease among patients with normal pregnancies and those destined to develop PE (preterm and term) or to deliver a small for gestational age (SGA) neonate.This longitudinal nested case-control study included 144 singleton pregnancies in the following groups: (1) patients with uncomplicated pregnancies who delivered appropriate for gestational age (AGA) neonates (n = 46) (2) patients who delivered an SGA neonate but did not develop PE (n = 56)(1) Patients destined to deliver an SGA neonate had higher plasma concentrations of s-Eng throughout gestation than those with normal pregnancies (2) patients destined to develop preterm PE and term PE had significantly higher concentrations of s-Eng than those with normal pregnancies at 23 and 30 weeks, respectively (for preterm PE: p < 0.036 and for term PE: p = 0.002)(1) Changes in the maternal plasma concentration of s-Eng, sVEGFR-1, and PlGF precede the clinical presentation of PE, but only changes in s-Eng and PlGF precede the delivery of an SGA neonate and (2) differences in the profile of angiogenic and anti-angiogenic response to intrauterine insults may determine whether a patient will deliver an SGA neonate, develop PE, or both.
