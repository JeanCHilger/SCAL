Quantitative d-dimer levels and the extent of venous thromboembolism in CT angiography and lower limb ultrasonography. We evaluated the diagnostic yield of multidetector-row CT angiography and determined the clot burden within pulmonary vasculature as a measure of pulmonary embolism (PE) severity at different d-dimer levels and pretest clinical probabilities.254 consecutive patients referred to CT pulmonary angiography for suspected PE after d-dimer testing were grouped into clinical probability classes using Wells' score, and the frequency of PE was determined. A score representing clot burden within pulmonary vasculature was calculated from the number of obstructed segmental arteries in CT scans in a partly differing group of 96 PE positive patients.The prevalence of PE increases with the d-dimer level (7% at d-dimer levels of 0.5-1 microg/ml, reaching 90% at d-dimer levels > 9 microg/ml p < 0.001). D-dimer levels above 4 microg/ml are associated with a significantly higher clot burden in pulmonary arteries (median score 11 versus 5, and 53% versus 16% of patients in the subgroup with a score > 10 pointsHigh d-dimer levels are associated with an increased prevalence of CT radiographic findings indicating extended clinically severe PE or lower limb venous thrombosis.
