Treatment of inferior vena cava thrombosis. How to avoid errors?. Unsatisfactory results of acute thrombosis treatment in inferior vena cava system are attributed to inadequate diagnosis, poor compliance with approved clinical practice guidelines and secondary preventive measures, as well as to excessive adherence to surgical methods of pulmonary embolism prophylaxis. Diagnostic strategy, which combines compressive duplex scanning and D-dimer test, can improve diagnosis and reduce its cost. Various molecular weight heparins and vitamin K antagonists are still the main means of venous thrombosis therapy. Appropriate medical treatment in many cases helps to avoid surgical interventions for pulmonary embolism prophylaxis and to reduce the rate of recurrent thromboses.
