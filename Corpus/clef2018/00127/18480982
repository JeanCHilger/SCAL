Thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor in preeclampsia and gestational hypertension throughout the gestation. To clarify the role of TAFI in hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, 22 subjects, including 10 with pre-eclampsia (PE) and 12 with gestational hypertension were examined for the levels of TAFI and thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complex. Thirty normal pregnant women served as controls. ELISA was employed for the detection. The results showed that the TAFI antigen levels in normal pregnancy group, gestational hypertension group and PE group were (85.35+/-24.69)%, (99.65+/-18.27)%, (110.12+/-23.36)% (97.06+/-21.40)%, (114.08+/-27.76)%, (125.49+/-24.70)%
