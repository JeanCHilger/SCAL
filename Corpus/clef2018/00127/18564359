Clinical features and outcome of pulmonary embolism in children. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is rare in childhood but evidence suggests it is under-recognised. Children diagnosed with PE at a large tertiary centre over an 8-year period were retrospectively reviewed. Fifty-six children with radiologically proven PE were identified, 31 males and 25 females, median age 12 years. Eighty-four per cent had symptoms of PE. Risk factors for thromboembolism were present in 54 patients (96.4%) most commonly immobility (58.9%), central venous line (35.7%) and recent surgery (28.6%). Investigation revealed a thrombophilic abnormality in 14/40 patients (35%). Concurrent deep vein thrombosis was confirmed in 31 patients (55.4%), predominantly lower limb. D dimer was elevated at presentation in 26/30 patients (86.7%). Eight patients underwent systemic thrombolysis. An inferior vena cava filter was placed in five patients. Therapy was complicated by major haemorrhage in 12 patients (21.4%). The majority (82.1%) had complete or partial resolution of PE following a median of 3 months anticoagulation. Seven patients had a recurrent thromboembolic event and 12 patients died (mortality 21.4%)
