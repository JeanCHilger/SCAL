CT angiography in the evaluation of acute pulmonary embolus. The purpose of this study was to assess the appropriate use of CT angiography (CTA) in the diagnostic evaluation of acute pulmonary embolism (PE).We reviewed a total of 575 CT angiograms obtained to evaluate for PE at a large level 1 trauma teaching hospital from January 2004 through March 2005. Various clinical settings were used for 267 inpatient (46%), 258 emergency department (45%), and 50 outpatient (9%) studies. We excluded CTA performed for other reasons, repeated CTA, and patient records with incomplete clinical data. On the basis of chart review in which the investigators were blinded to final diagnoses, pretest probability of PE according to the Wells criteria was retrospectively assigned to each patient. D-dimer values, when obtained, also were reviewed. The diagnosis of PE was based on final CTA reports.PE was diagnosed in 9.57% of 575 patients. Positivity rates by location were 32 (12%) of the 267 inpatients, 22 (8.5%) of the 258 emergency department patients, and one (2.0%) of the 50 outpatients. Three (< 1%) of the 575 patients had high probability of PE, even though 351 patients had gone directly to CTA. Of the other 572 patients, 158 (28%) had intermediate and 414 (72%) low probability of PE. In the high, intermediate, and low probability groups, two (67%), 24 (15%), and 29 (7%), respectively, of the patients had PE. A D-dimer assay was performed for 224 (39%) of the 575 patients. Thirty-nine (17%) of the 224 patients had normal results (< 0.5 microg/mL) 107 (48%), intermediate results (0.6-2.0 microg/mL)Our data showed suboptimal use of the Wells criteria and subjective overestimation of the probability of PE before ordering of CTA. Although a definitive acceptable PE positivity rate for CTA has not been established, the 10% yield represents overuse of CTA as a screening rather than a diagnostic examination.
