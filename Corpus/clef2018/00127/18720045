Adhesion molecules (VCAM-1 and ICAM-1) and C-reactive protein in women with history of preeclampsia. Several studies suggest that women with previous preeclampsia (PE) are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). We examined circulating concentrations of adhesion molecules and C-reactive protein (CRP), markers for endothelial and inflammatory reactions, in addition to blood pressure and anthropometric measurements in 58 women with a history of PE and 49 control women with no pathology associated to pregnancy. Soluble adhesion molecules were measured by standard commercial ELISA methods and plasma CRP levels by automated enzymatic assays. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures and waist-to-hip ratios were significantly higher in women with history of PE than in control group. There were no significant differences in circulating levels of sICAM-1, sVCAM-1 and CRP in the study population. Women with a history of PE do not have a persistent inflammatory state that could induce overexpression of these molecules, which was supported by normal levels of CRP. The study supports the existence of common risk factors for PE and CVD, namely obesity and hypertension.
