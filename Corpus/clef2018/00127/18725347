Discrepancy between two methods of D-dimers measurement: one case of human anti-mouse antibody interference. Quantification of D-dimers is the major biometry step in the diagnostic of an episode of the venous thromboembolic disease. The measurement of D-dimers can be performed with ELISA or immunoturbidimetric methods suited to emergency, using a mouse monoclonal antibody as capture and/or revelation antibody. Therefore, the presence in patient's plasma of human antibody mouse (HAMA) that binds the mouse antiglobulin used in immunoassays can lead to false negative or false positive results. In a young woman presenting repetitive thoracic pain suggestive of a pulmonary embolism, a major discrepancy was found between one result of D-dimers above the cut-off with an immunoturbidimetric method (STA Liatest D-DI Diagnostica Stago) and one result below the cut-off with a sandwich method (Vidas D-Dimer Exclusion
