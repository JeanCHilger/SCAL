Hyperhomocysteinemia is not sufficient to cause preeclampsia in an animal model: the importance of folate intake. The objective of our study was to determine whether methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (Mthfr)-deficient mice develop preeclampsia (PE).Mice were placed on a normal or low-folate/high-methionine (LF/HM) diet to assess the impact of mild and severe homocysteinemia. Blood pressure and proteinuria were measured throughout gestation in Mthfr-deficient and control mice on both diets, by radiotelemetry and by determining the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively.Although Mthfr-deficient mice have endothelial dysfunction, they do not develop hypertension or proteinuria during gestation. The LF/HM diet induced proteinuria, growth restriction, and a decrease in the number of pups per litter in all mice without any effect on the placenta.Our study clearly demonstrates that hyperhomocysteinemia is not sufficient to cause PE in this animal model. Furthermore, it confirms the importance of folate intake on pregnancy outcomes.
