Has high-definition spiral computed tomography changed the management of patients with acute pulmonary embolism?. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common condition carrying a significant degree of mortality if not diagnosed early. The diagnosis of PE is challenging, because of the non-specific nature of its clinical features. For many years the diagnostic strategies for PE have mainly involved ventilation/perfusion lung scan as the chief diagnostic procedure, often associated with a few clinical models of pre-test probability and the D-dimer test. These modalities of diagnosing PE, though quite satisfactory in various clinical settings, show several limitations, the most important one being the high rate of non-diagnostic procedures. The introduction of computed tomography (CT) has changed the diagnostic strategies and has become the main diagnostic procedure for diagnosing PE. CT is undergoing a rapid technological upgrade, which will open in the near future new frontiers in the diagnosis of PE. Nonetheless, CT carries a number of limitations, which should be carefully identified. This article reviews the evidences on both the traditional and newer diagnostic strategies for PE, outlines their strengths and weaknesses and describes future applications of CT for diagnosing PE.
