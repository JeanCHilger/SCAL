Changes of blood count, lymphocyte subpopulations and immunoglobulin levels in nephroblastoma long term survivors. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of blood count, lymphocyte subpopulations, and immunoglobulin levels alterations in a group of healthy nephroblastoma long-term survivors. The group included 122 nephroblastoma longterm survivors who were at least five years post anticancer therapy and free of any sign of recurrence The proportion of lymphocyte subpopulations was analyzed by flow cytometry using antibodies anti CD45 FITC/CD14 PE, anti CD3 FITC/ CD16+CD56 PE, anti CD4 FITC/ CD8 PE and anti CD20 FITC. Immunoglobulin G, A, and M levels were evaluated by immunoturbidimetry. Total blood count was also examined. The occurrence of decreased immunoglobulin levels, leukocytes, lymphocytes, and granulocytes count, proportion of T lymphocytes and their CD4+ subpopulation are not frequent. The most frequently decreased lymphocyte subpopulation was CD8 (15.5%). The most frequent abnormal findings were increased proportion of NK cells (38.5 %), B lymphocytes (38,52 %), decreased number of erythrocytes (25.2 %), hemoglobin levels (41.7 %) and hematocrit (13.9 %). The only significant differences between results of immunological examination and course of the disease were more frequently decreased proportion of CD4+ lymphocytes in recurrent disease survivors and lower IgA levels in survivors after radiotherapy. We found decreased at least one immunological parameter in one fifth of the survivors. The most frequently altered parameter was hemoglobin, which was decreased in 41.7 % of survivors. Decraesed hemoglobin may worsen quality of survivors life. Key words: nephroblastoma long-term survivors, blood count, lymphocyte subpopulations, immunoglobulin G, A, M serum levels.
