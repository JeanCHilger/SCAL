Interactions between inflammatory and oxidative stress in preeclampsia. Oxidative stress and a generalized inflammatory state are features of preeclampsia (PE). The objective of this study was to compare the levels of products of inflammatory reaction and oxidative stress markers in patients with PE, and to determine the relationship between oxidative stress and inflammation in PE.Plasma concentrations of high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), malondialdehyde (MDA), and 8-isoprostane were measured in 53 women with PE and 20 age- and BMI-matched normotensive women.The plasma concentrations of hs-CRP, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and 8-isoprostane were significantly higher in women with PE than in those with normotensive pregnancies, and these parameters, except for 8-isoprostane, were markedly elevated in those with severe PE (SPE), rather than mild PE (MPE). Moreover, plasma levels of 8-isoprostane, not MDA, were significantly correlated with the plasma levels of hs-CRP, IL-6, and TNF-alpha in patients with PE.These findings suggest that oxidative stress and inflammatory reaction are closely associated with PE, and the interactions between them may participate in the pathogenesis of PE.
