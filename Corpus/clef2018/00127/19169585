HIV/HCV coinfection at an university hospital in Recife, Brazil. To estimate the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and risks factors associated with coinfection in HIV-positive individuals.A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted with 343 HIV patients attended at a university hospital in Recife, Northeastern Brazil, from March to December 2003. A standardized questionnaire about risk factors was administered. Serum samples were analyzed for anti-HCV antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), HCV-RNA using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and genotyping using the ABI 377 (PE Biosystems). Univariate and multivariate analyses and multiple logistic regression were performed.HCV prevalence was 4.1% (14/343) using ELISA and 3.2% (11/343) using RT-PCR. The most common genotypes were 1b (45%), 3 (33%) and 1a (22%). Co-infection was higher among those aged 30 to 39 years, and predominantly in males (64.3 %). In the multiple logistic regression, the variable blood transfusion was the single remaining risk factor for HCV (OR=4.28 95% CI 1.44The prevalence of HIV/HCV coinfection was low. Blood transfusion was a risk factor and HCV genotype 1b was the most frequently found.
