In vitro plasma-induced endothelial oxidative stress and circulating markers of endothelial dysfunction in preeclampsia: an observational study. To investigate plasma-induced endothelial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in vitro and its relation to endothelial dysfunction in preeclampsia (PE).Plasma was drawn from 17 PE patients, 17 matched healthy pregnant (HP) women, 17 matched non-pregnant healthy volunteers (NP), and 10 septic shock (SC) patients. In vitro plasma-induced ROS production was assessed in cultured human endothelial cells. In vivo endothelial activation and injury were assessed through measurements of plasma von Willebrand factor (vWF) and soluble thrombomodulin (sTM) concentrations, respectively.Endothelial ROS production was not induced by PE, HP, and NP plasmas. However, it was significantly increased in SC compared to other groups (p < .005). Pregnancy (PE and HP) was associated with higher vWF compared to NP. Among pregnancies, vWF was higher in PE compared to HP women (p < .05). sTM was unchanged between PE, HP and NP. In SC, vWF and sTM were significantly increased compared to other groups (p < .01). Simultaneously, endothelial ROS production and sTM concentration were correlated (p = .673 p < .05). CONCLUSION. Plasma does not induce in vitro endothelial ROS production in PE women for which endothelial dysfunction is limited to activation but not injury. By contrast, SC patients demonstrate both endothelial activation and injury, closely related to plasma-induced endothelial oxidative stress.
