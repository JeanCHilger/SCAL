Kinetics of D-dimer after general surgery. D-dimers may be elevated after surgery. However, the kinetics of postoperative D-dimers remains unknown hampering the use of D-dimer testing in surgical patients with suspected venous thromboembolism. D-dimer levels were prospectively measured in 154 patients after general surgery at predefined time points (kinetics were determined in an initial cohort of 108 patients for validation, these findings were applied to a second cohort of 46 patients). Clinical factors influencing the peak of D-dimers were analyzed using multivariate regression. Surgical operations were stratified based on severity (type I: not entering abdominal cavity
