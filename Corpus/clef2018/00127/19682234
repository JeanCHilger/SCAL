Clinical probability score and D-dimer estimation lack utility in the diagnosis of childhood pulmonary embolism. Childhood pulmonary embolism (PE) causes significant mortality and evidence suggests that it is under-diagnosed. Clinical probability scores and D-dimer estimation to assess pre-test probability have not been studied in children with suspected PE.This retrospective cohort study evaluated Wells simplified probability score for PE in 50 children with PE and 25 PE negative control patients, and D-dimer values in 27 PE positive and 12 PE negative children.PE positive and PE negative groups had similar rates of risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Wells simplified probability score showed a small difference between PE positive and PE negative children (median score: PE positive, 4.5 PE negative, 4The Wells clinical probability score and D-dimer estimation may lack utility in the determination of pre-test probability of PE in children. Validation of a pediatric clinical probability score, incorporating D-dimer estimation, by prospective study, would be difficult as a result of the rarity of childhood PE.
