Altered fibrin clot structure/function in patients with idiopathic venous thromboembolism and in their relatives. We tested the hypothesis that fibrin structure/function is unfavorably altered in patients after idiopathic venous thromboembolism (VTE) and their relatives. Ex vivo plasma fibrin clot permeability, turbidimetry, and efficiency of fibrinolysis were investigated in 100 patients with first-ever VTE, including 34 with pulmonary embolism (PE), 100 first-degree relatives, and 100 asymptomatic controls with no history of thrombotic events. Known thrombophilia, cancer, trauma, and surgery were exclusion criteria. VTE patients and their relatives were characterized by lower clot permeability (P < .001), lower compaction (P < .001), higher maximum clot absorbancy (P < .001), and prolonged clot lysis time (P < .001) than controls, with more pronounced abnormalities, except maximum clot absorbance, in the patients versus relatives (all P < .01). Fibrin clots obtained for PE patients were more permeable, less compact, and were lysed more efficiently compared with deep-vein thrombosis patients (all P < .05) with no differences in their relatives. Being VTE relative, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein were independent predictors of clot permeability and fibrinolysis time in combined analysis of controls and relatives. We conclude that altered fibrin clot features are associated with idiopathic VTE with a different profile of fibrin variables in PE. Similar features can be detected in VTE relatives. Fibrin properties might represent novel risk factors for thrombosis.
