Circulating levels of soluble KIT serve as a biomarker for clinical outcome in gastrointestinal stromal tumor patients receiving sunitinib following imatinib failure. To evaluate changes in circulating levels of soluble KIT (sKIT) extracellular domain as a potential biomarker for clinical outcome in gastrointestinal stromal tumor patients treated with the multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib following imatinib failure in a previously reported phase III study.Patients received sunitinib 50 mg/d (n = 243) or placebo (n = 118) daily in 6-week cycles (4 weeks on, 2 weeks off treatment). Plasma sKIT levels were sampled every 2 weeks in cycle 1 and on days 1 and 28 of subsequent cycles analyzed by ELISAFrom 4 weeks on treatment and onward, significant differences were shown between treatment groups (P < 0.0001) in sKIT level changes from baseline (median levels decreased with sunitinib and increased with placebo). Decreases in sKIT levels were a significant predictor of longer time to tumor progression (TTP). Patients with reduced levels at the end of cycle 2 had a median TTP of 34.3 weeks versus 16.0 weeks for patients with increased levels [hazard ratio, 0.71 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.61-0.83The results suggest that circulating plasma sKIT levels seem to function as a surrogate marker for TTP in gastrointestinal stromal tumor patients. Additional studies are warranted to confirm and expand these findings.
