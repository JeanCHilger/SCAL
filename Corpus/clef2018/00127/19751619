Ischemia-modified albumin in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism: an experimental study. We designed this experimental study to determine the value of ischemia-modified albumin in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.Twenty-four mature female New Zealand rabbits were divided into 4 groups, each consisting of 6 animals. These were classified into group 1 ,the control group group 2, the deep venous thrombosis groupPulmonary embolism was established in all the rabbits in groups 3 and 4, and this was confirmed by tomographic and histologic findings. Measurement of mean ischemia-modified albumin levels for all rabbits at hours 0, 1, 3, and 6 revealed that mean ischemia-modified albumin levels in groups 3 and 4 were statistically significantly higher than those in groups 1 and 2. There was no difference between the mean ischemia-modified albumin levels in groups 1 and 2 nor between groups 3 and 4. The alteration in ischemia-modified albumin levels over time was statistically significant.The results of our experimental study demonstrate that ischemia-modified albumin levels may be useful in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.
