Fatal pulmonary tumour embolism as initial manifestation of an occult coecum tumour. A 57-year-old woman without significant medical history presented. She had suffered from dyspnoea for the past 2 days and persistent spasmodic abdominal complaints for the past 2 weeks. Physical examination revealed tachypnoea, tachycardia and slight abdominal tenderness. Laboratory investigations revealed hypoxaemia and a strongly elevated D-dimer level. Thorax radiography revealed no abnormalities and no indications for pulmonary embolism were revealed by the CT. Abdominal ultrasound revealed multiple enlarged lymph nodes. Shortly after admission and despite resuscitation the patient died. Autopsy revealed massive pulmonary tumour embolism that originated from a primary lymphogenic metastasized coecum carcinoma. Pulmonary tumour embolism is characterised by tumour cells in the pulmonary vascular system, which exhibit no continuity with parenchymal metastases. Due to the less than specific findings revealed by history taking, physical examination and additional tests, the condition is rarely diagnosed ante mortem.
