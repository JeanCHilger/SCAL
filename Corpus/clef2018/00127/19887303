Markers of haemostasis and angiogenesis in placentae from gestational vascular complications: impairment of mechanisms involved in maintaining intervillous blood flow. Preeclampsia (PE) and fetal growth restriction (FGR) are multifactorial diseases, whose pathogenesis is largely unknown. A significant relationship between haemostasis and angiogenesis in placentae from uneventful pregnancies was previously shown.RNA expression of haemostasis (TF, TFPI, TFPI-2, PAI-2, Anx V, TM) and angiogenesis (Ang-1, Ang-2, PlGF, VEGF) markers in placentae from PE (n=12), PE+FGR (n=17) and FGR (n=20) in respect of placentae from uncomplicated pregnancies (n=21) were investigated.Placentae from complicated pregnancies showed a significant lower expression (p<or=0.05 Mann-Whitney U test) of TF, TFPI, TFPI-2, Anx V, PAI-2 than those from in uncomplicated ones. VEGF and PlGF were not different in the considered groups Ang-1 and Ang-2 were significantly higher (p<or=0.05 Mann-Whitney U test) in the PE group. Correlations between factors involved in haemostasis and those involved in angiogenesis, observed in placentae from uneventful pregnancies are lacking in those from complicated ones.Haemostasis factors are reduced in placentae from complicated pregnancies. The relationship between haemostasis and angiogenesis observed in uncomplicated pregnancies is impaired in PE and FGR.
