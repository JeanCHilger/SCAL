Cardiac biomarkers and pulmonary embolism: prognostic stratification. In hemodynamically stable patients with signs of right ventricular dysfunction, the mortality related to acute pulmonary embolism (PE) may be as high as 10%. In the absence of any haemodynamic and cardiac repercussion, the clinical evolution is benign and outpatient treatment may be contemplated. It is therefore mandatory to develop tools for early prognostic stratification in order to improve efficient patient care. This article discusses more specifically the role of cardiac biomarkers (natriuretic peptides and troponin) in assessing PE prognosis and severity at the time of the diagnosis.
