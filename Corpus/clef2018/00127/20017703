Neurokinin B and urotensin II levels in pre-eclampsia. To verify neurokinin B (NKB) and urotensin II (UII) plasma levels in pre-eclampsia (PE) and to determine the relationship between plasma NKB and UII levels.A total of 60 women in the third trimester of pregnancy were recruited, 40 women with PE (study patients) and 20 age- and BMI-matched normotensive women (healthy controls). They were divided into three groups: the 20 normotensive pregnant women (Group 1) 20 women with mild PE (Group 2)Compared with controls, levels of NKB were significantly higher in women with mild or severe PE (p < 0.01 for both groups), levels of UII were significantly higher in women with mild or severe PE (p < 0.01 for both groups). Moreover, there was a positive correlation between plasma levels of NKB and UII in pre-eclamptic women (r = 0.783, p < 0.01).These findings suggest that there was an elevation of NKB and UII in the plasma of pre-eclamptic women. NKB and UII may be involved in the pathophysiology of PE and associated with the development of severe disease.
