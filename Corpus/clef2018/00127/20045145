Preliminary report: circulating levels of the adipokine vaspin in gestational diabetes mellitus and preeclampsia. The objective of the study was to investigate serum levels of the insulin-sensitizing adipokine vaspin in patients with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and preeclampsia (PE) as compared with healthy controls of similar gestational age. Vaspin serum levels were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in control (n = 102), GDM (n = 40), and PE (n = 22) subjects. Median maternal vaspin concentrations were not significantly different in GDM, PE, and control subjects. Furthermore, vaspin did not significantly correlate to clinical and biochemical measures of renal function, glucose, and lipid metabolism, as well as inflammation. Circulating vaspin levels are not significantly different between GDM, PE, and control subjects and do not correlate with insulin sensitivity in pregnant subjects.
