Maternal serum ADAM-12 as a potential marker for different adverse pregnancy outcomes. To investigate first-trimester ADAM-12 levels in pregnancies which later develop hypertensive and growth complications.First-trimester serum samples (11(+0) to 13(+6) weeks) were retrieved from frozen storage. 47 samples with at least one of the following adverse outcomes: pre-eclampsia (PE), small for gestational age, HELLP syndrome and gestational hypertension were analysed and 452 controls matched to the cases by gestational age and length of storage were analysed. ADAM-12 levels were measured by the automated AutoDELFIA immunoassay platform.ADAM-12 was found to increase with gestational age (11(+0) to 13(+6) weeks) and decrease with increasing maternal weight and in women who smoked. After correction, ADAM-12 median multiples of the median were increased in cases with HELLP syndrome, all PE and PE only.The increased first-trimester levels of ADAM-12 in PE and HELLP are in contrast with previous findings. The usefulness of ADAM-12 as a marker for adverse outcomes is still unclear.
