Single cardiac troponin T measurement predicts risk for adverse outcome in decompensated heart failure. The slight increase in cardiac troponin in the blood of patients with heart failure (HF) suggests that myofibrils are degraded in the myocardium and released in the circulation, reflecting a continuous and progressive injury process in the contractile system.To correlate the serum levels of cardiac troponin T (TnT) at the hospital admission of patients with decompensated HF and prognosis.A total of 79 consecutive patients, hospitalized due to decompensated HF, with LVEF < 45%, were included in the study. Patients were followed for 8 months. We excluded patients using intravenous inotropic agents, as well as those with acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary thromboembolism, creatinine levels > 2.5 mg%, liver failure, or neuromuscular diseases.High levels of TnTc (>0.02 ng/ml) were detected in 37 patients (46.84%). The global mortality was 35.4%. In the groups with high TnT and low TnT levels (<0.02 ng/ml) there were, respectively, 19 versus 9 deaths (RR=2.4 95%CI 1.24-4.63The single troponin measurement at hospital admission in patients with decompensated HF predicts adverse outcomes and should be considered at the early stratification of long-term morbimortality.
