Changes of plasma uPA and TGF-beta1 in patients with preeclampsia. To study the roles of uPA and TGF-beta1 in the etiology of preeclampsia (PE).The plasma uPA and TGF-beta 1 were determined with enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 70 patients with PE, and compared with those with normal pregnancy (n = 40).1) The patients with PE had lower levels of plasma uPA (436.39 +/- 29.57) pg/mL than those with normal pregnancy [(646.54 +/- 35.39) pg/mL, P < 0.01]. No significant difference was found in the levels of plasma uPA between the patients with severe PE (417.11 +/- 48.47) pg/mL and the patients with mild PE [(468.81 +/- 14.91) pg/mL, P > 0.05]. 2) The patients with PE had higher levels of plasma TGF-beta1 (14.32 +/- 4.37) ng/mL than those with normal pregnancy [(9.85 +/- 3.19) ng/mL, P < 0. 05]. No significant difference was found in the levels of plasma TGF-beta1 between the patients with severe PE (15.37 +/- 4.93) ng/mL and the patients with mild PE [(11.21 +/- 2.32) ng/mL, P > 0.05)]. 3) There was a negative correlation between plasma uPA and plasma TGF-beta1 in the patients with PE (r = -0.497, P < 0.01).The changes of uPA and TGF-beta1 are associated with the occurrence and development of PE.
