Distinct patterns of circulating endothelial cells in pulmonary hypertension. The respective abundance of circulating endothelial cells and endothelial progenitor cells may reflect the balance between vascular injury and repair. As pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) can share features of pulmonary remodelling, we postulated that the two disorders might be associated with different types of pulmonary endothelial dysfunction. We studied 25 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac catheterisation for suspected pulmonary hypertension. Nine patients had PAH, nine had CTEPH, and seven had normal pulmonary arterial pressure and served as controls. Circulating endothelial cells were isolated with CD146-coated beads. CD34(+)CD133(+) cell and endothelial progenitor cell numbers were respectively determined by flow cytometry and cell culture, in peripheral vein and pulmonary artery blood. Plasma levels of soluble vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), soluble E-selectin and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule (sVCAM) were measured by ELISA. No difference in progenitor counts or VEGF levels was found across the three groups. Compared to controls, circulating endothelial cell numbers were significantly increased in PAH but not in CTEPH, in keeping with the elevated soluble E-selectin and sVCAM levels found in PAH alone. In conclusion, PAH, in contrast to CTEPH, is associated with markers of vascular injury (circulating endothelial cells, soluble E-selectin and sVCAM) but not with markers of remodelling (endothelial progenitor cells, CD34(+)CD133(+) cells and VEGF).
