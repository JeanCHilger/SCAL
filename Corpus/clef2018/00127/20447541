Elevated heart-type fatty acid-binding protein levels on admission predict an adverse outcome in normotensive patients with acute pulmonary embolism. We assessed the predictive value of heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP) in normotensive patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE).Risk stratification of initially normotensive patients with PE on the basis of right ventricular dysfunction or injury remains controversial. Previous studies investigating biomarkers or imaging modalities included unselected patients, some of whom presented with cardiogenic shock.We included 126 consecutive normotensive patients with confirmed PE. Complicated 30-day outcome was defined as death, resuscitation, intubation, or use of catecholamines. Long-term survival was assessed by follow-up clinical examination.During the first 30 days, 9 (7%) patients suffered complications. These patients had higher baseline H-FABP values (median, 11.2 ng/ml [interquartile range: 8.0 to 36.8 ng/ml]) compared with patients with an uncomplicated course (3.4 ng/ml [2.1 to 4.9 ng/ml] p < 0.001). H-FABP values were above the calculated (by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis) cutoff value of 6 ng/ml in 29 patients. Eight (28%) of them suffered complications versus 1 of 97 patients with low H-FABP (negative predictive value, 99%The H-FABP might be a useful biomarker for risk stratification of normotensive patients with acute PE.
