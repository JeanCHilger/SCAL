Placental protein-13 and pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A as first trimester screening markers for hypertensive disorders and small for gestational age outcomes. To investigate the role of placenta protein 13 (PP13) and pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) in hypertensive disorders and small for gestational age (SGA) during first trimester of pregnancy.In this case-control study, first trimester serum samples (11(+0) to 13(+6) weeks) were retrieved from frozen storage of which 452 were from normal pregnancies and 47 samples were identified to have pregnancies with at least one of the following adverse outcomes: SGA, preeclampsia (PE), hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets (HELLP), or gestational hypertension (GH). PP13 concentrations were measured by a new AutoDELFIA method. Levels of PAPP-A were measured for a first trimester screening program using Kryptor analyzer.First trimester levels of PAPP-A are significantly lower in cases of SGA, PE, and most subgroups including HELLP. Levels of PP13 were not found to differ between control and affected pregnancies.PP13 needs to be studied further as our results contrast the majority of previous studies.
