Effects of cimetropium bromide on gallbladder contraction in response to oral and intraduodenal olive oil. To evaluate the influence of the stomach and the cholinergic system on gallbladder contraction induced by physiological stimuli, the reduction in gallbladder volume in 7 healthy volunteers has been studied by real-time ultrasonography after the oral and intraduodenal administration of olive oil, preceded by pretreatment with cimetropium bromide or placebo. After an overnight fast, each subject swallowed 50 ml olive oil or it was administered through a naso-duodenal tube in the proximal duodenum. Cimetropium bromide 5 mg or placebo was given intravenously under double-blind control. After the placebo pretreatment, gallbladder contraction was greater and faster after intraduodenal oil than after oral oil. Cimetropium bromide decreased the extent, velocity and duration of gallbladder contraction induced by intraduodenal olive oil but it only reduced the velocity of the contraction induced by oil given orally. It is concluded that in normal human subjects the stomach modulates the extent and velocity of postprandial gallbladder contraction and that anticholinergic agents antagonize the gastric and duodenal phases of the response of the gallbladder to a meal.
