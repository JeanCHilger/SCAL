Effect atorvastatin on serum tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1β following acute pulmonary embolism. This study was designed to investigate the effect of atorvastatin on the serum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) following acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Forty New Zealand white rabbits were divided into control and atorvastatin groups. Acute PE was created by injection of autologous blood clots into the femoral vein. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure TNF-α and IL-1β. At baseline, there was no significant difference in serum TNF-α (10.6 ± 1.3 versus 11.2 ± 1.9 pg/mL P > .05) or IL-1β (8.2 ± 1.0 versus 8.6 ± 0.9 pg/mL
