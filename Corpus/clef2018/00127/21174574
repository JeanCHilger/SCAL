Adiponectin levels in circulation and breast milk and mRNA expression in adipose tissue of preeclampsia women. Physiological insulin resistance occurs in normal pregnancy and is exaggerated in women with preeclampsia (PE). Adiponectin is a hormone with insulin-sensitizing, anti-atherogenic, and anti-inflammatory properties. Reports published on association between adiponectin levels and PE risk have been conflicting. This study sought to better determine the circulating adiponectin levels and its mRNA expression in adipose tissue in women with PE.This report includes a cross-sectional study at a Chinese clinical research center and meta-analysis. The cross-sectional study included normal pregnancy women (n = 28) and PE women (n = 20) who underwent cesarean operation. Adiponectin concentrations in maternal serum, cord blood, and colostrums were determined by ELISA. Adiponectin mRNA expression levels in adipose tissue were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Meta-analysis was done on 13 studies, including 302 PE women and 385 normal pregnancy women.In comparison with controls, PE women had higher serum adiponectin concentrations in maternal blood and breast milk, but lower adiponectin concentration in cord blood. Adiponectin mRNA expression in the subcutaneous (Sc) and omental adipose tissues (OM) did not differ between the two groups of women. Meta-analysis confirms that the circulating adiponectin levels were elevated in PE women (p < 0.01).PE women had a higher adiponectin concentration in the maternal blood as well as breast milk but lower adiponectin concentration in umbilical cord blood when compared to women with normal pregnancy. The elevated circulating adiponectin levels in PE women are probably because of a reduced degradation/elimination rather than an increased synthesis of this hormone.
