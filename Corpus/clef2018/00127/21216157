Percutaneous mechanical and pharmacomechanical thrombolysis for occlusive deep vein thrombosis of the proximal limb in adolescent subjects: findings from an institution-based prospective inception cohort study of pediatric venous thromboembolism. Young individuals with occlusive, proximal-limb deep vein thrombosis (DVT) who have acutely increased plasma levels of factor VIII and D-dimer are at high risk for postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) when treated with conventional anticoagulation alone. The present report is an evaluation of experience with adjunctive percutaneous mechanical thrombolysis (PMT) and/or percutaneous pharmacomechanical thrombolysis (PPMT) in such patients.Among 95 children 11-21 years of age enrolled in a prospective cohort of venous thromboembolism between March 1, 2006, and November 1, 2009, 16 met eligibility criteria and underwent PMT/PPMT, typically with adjunctive catheter-directed thrombolytic infusion (CDTI) of tissue-type plasminogen activator given after the procedure.Median age was 16 years (range, 11-19 y). Thirteen cases (81%) involved lower limbs. Underlying stenotic lesions were disclosed in 53%, with endovascular stents deployed in all cases of May-Thurner anomaly. There were no periprocedural major bleeding events and one symptomatic pulmonary embolism. Technical success rate was 94%. Early (< 30 days) locally recurrent DVT developed in 40% of cases, of which 83% were successfully treated with repeat lysis. Late recurrent DVT rate (median follow-up duration, 14 months range, 1-42 mo) was 27%. Cumulative incidence of physically and functionally significant PTS at 1-2 years was 13%.This experience provides preliminary evidence that PMT/PPMT with adjunctive CDTI can be used safely and effectively in adolescent subjects with DVT at high risk for PTS.
