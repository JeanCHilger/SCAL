New F-18 prosthetic group via oxime coupling. A novel fluorine-18 prosthetic ligand, 5-(1,3-dioxolan-2-yl)-2-(2-(2-(2-fluoroethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)pyridine [(18)F]2, has been synthesized. The prosthetic ligand is formed in high radiochemical yield (rcy = 71 ± 2%, n = 3) with excellent radiochemical purity (rcp = 99 ± 1%, n = 3) in a short reaction time (10 min). [(18)F]2 is a small, neutral, organic complex, easily synthesized in four steps from a readily available starting material. It can be anchored onto a target molecule containing an aminooxy functional group under acidic conditions by way of an oxime bond. We report herein two examples [(18)F]23 and [(18)F]24, potential imaging agents for β-amyloid plaques, which were labeled with this prosthetic group. This approach could be used for labeling proteins and peptides containing an aminooxy group. Biodistribution in male ICR mice for both oxime labeled complexes [(18)F]23 and [(18)F]24 were compared to that of the known β-amyloid plaque indicator, [(18)F]-AV-45, florbetapir 1. Oximes [(18)F]23 and [(18)F]24 are larger in size and therefore should reduce the blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration. The brain uptake for oxime [(18)F]23 appeared to be reduced, but still retained some capability to cross the BBB. Oxime [(18)F]24 showed promising results after 2 min post injection (0.48% dose/gram) however, the uptake increased after 30 min post injection (0.92% dose/gram) suggesting an in vivo decomposition/metabolism of compound [(18)F]24. We have demonstrated a general protocol for the fluoride-18 labeling with a new prosthetic ligand [(18)F]2 that is tolerant toward several functional groups and is formed via chemoselective oxime coupling.
