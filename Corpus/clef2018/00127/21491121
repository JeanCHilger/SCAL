Soluble CD40 ligand levels in acute pulmonary embolism: a prospective, randomized, controlled study. CD40 ligand is a thromboinflammatory molecule that predicts cardiovascular events. Platelets constitute the major source of soluble CD40 ligands (sCD40L), which has been shown to influence platelet activation. The main aim of this study was to evaluate sCD40L levels in patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Sixty-five PE patients (32 males, mean age 58 ± 12 years) and 29 healthy controls (15 males, mean age 56 ± 14 years) were enrolled in the study. sCD40L levels were evaluated at the enrollment by ELISA method. Multislice detected pulmonary computed tomography was performed on all patients with a suspected diagnosis of PE. In addition, echocardiography was performed to evaluate right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups regarding demographic features. sCD40L levels were significantly higher in acute PE group compared to healthy controls (5.3 ng/ml and 1.4 ng/ml, respectively p < 0.001). sCD40L levels of patients with and without RV dysfunction were similar. Correlation analysis between echocardiographic findings and sCD40L levels did not show significant difference. The present study demonstrated a role of sCD40L in pathogenesis of PE for the first time. Further studies are needed to clarify a predictive and prognostic value of sCD40L levels in acute PE patients.
