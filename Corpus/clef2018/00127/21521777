Pentostatin plus cyclophosphamide safely and effectively prevents immunotoxin immunogenicity in murine hosts. The success of immunotoxin therapy of cancer is limited by host production of neutralizing antibodies, which are directed toward the Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE) component. In this proof-of-principle study using a well-established murine model, we hypothesized that a newly developed immune depletion regimen consisting of pentostatin plus cyclophosphamide would abrogate anti-immunotoxin reactivity.BALB/c hosts were injected weekly with recombinant immunotoxin (RIT) SS1P, which is an antimesothelin Fv antibody fragment genetically fused to a 38 kDa portion of PE, and has been evaluated in clinical trials. Experimental cohorts received induction chemotherapy consisting of pentostatin (P) plus cyclophosphamide (C) prior to initial RIT exposure some cohorts received further maintenance PC therapy of varying intensity just prior to each weekly RIT challenge. Cohorts were monitored for T, B, myeloid cell depletion, and for total anti-SS1P antibody (Ab) formation.Controls uniformly developed anti-SS1P Ab after the third RIT exposure. Induction PC therapy reduced the frequency of hosts with anti-SS1P Ab. Abrogation of antibody generation was improved by maintenance PC therapy: nearly 100% of recipients of intensive PC maintenance were free of anti-SS1P Ab after 9 weekly RIT doses. The most effective PC regimen yielded the greatest degree of host B-cell depletion, moderate T-cell depletion, and minimal myeloid cell depletion.Induction and maintenance PC chemotherapy safely prevented anti-immunotoxin antibody formation with uniform efficacy. These data suggest that immunotoxin therapy might be used in combination with pentostatin plus cyclophosphamide chemotherapy to improve the targeted therapy of cancer.
