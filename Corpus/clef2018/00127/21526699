How do I manage a patient with suspected acute pulmonary embolism? Acute PE is a cardiovascular emergency and early risk stratification is important in the management of these patients. Pre-test clinical prediction models together with D-dimer assays help select those who require imaging. Each hospital should develop a strategy for investigating patients with suspected PE depending on local expertise, resources and the patient population.
