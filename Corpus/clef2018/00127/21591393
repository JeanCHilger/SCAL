Independent predictors of deep vein thrombosis (results of prospective 18 months study). We followed for 18 months 90 patients who had had deep vein thrombosis (DVE) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) and received therapy with anticoagulants either for 3-12 months or for indefinitely long time. During follow-up rate of recurrent DVE was 16.7%, no recurrences of PE were registered. Predictors of recurrent PE were selected among 165 demographic, anthropometric, anamnestic, clinical, genetic, instrumental, and laboratory parameters, as well as risk factors of development of thromboembolic complications. According to results of multifactorial regression analysis we established the following independent predictors recurrent DVE during 18 months of follow-up: elevated level of DAdimer after 1 month of anticoagulant therapy (p=0.005 relative risk--relative risk [RR] 8.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9 to 34.8), homozygosity for C249T polymorphism in beta-fibrinogen gene (p=0.044
