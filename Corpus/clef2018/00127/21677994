Complement component C4A and apolipoprotein A-I in plasmas as biomarkers of the severe, early-onset preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is a common pregnancy complication that is associated with maternal perinatal morbidity and mortality. Because of its early onset (before 34 weeks) and the potential for serious outcomes, severe, early-onset preeclampsia (sePE) should be regarded as a different form of preeclampsia. It is an important cause of preterm birth and fetal growth restriction and adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. As there is no diagnostic test yet available for this disease, we used a proteomic approach to identify novel plasma biomarkers for developing severe, early-onset preeclampsia. We conducted case-control studies comparing nulliparous women with severe preeclampsia requiring delivery prior to 34 weeks of gestation with healthy nulliparous women matched by gestational age at sampling. Plasma was depleted of albumin and IgG and analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE). Seven specific plasma proteins for early-onset preeclampsia were detected by mass spectrometry had statistically significant expression differences when compared to controls. The expression of complement component C4A and apolipoprotein A-I were validated by immunoblotting. The complement component C4A in the plasmas of sePE women is lower than the severe, late-onset PE (slPE) women [mean ± SD 3.05 ± 0.14 times reference level (normal/sePE) in sePE women vs. 2.73 ± 0.10 times reference level (normal/slPE) in slPE women, P < 0.05]. Apolipoprotein A-I is higher in sePE women than slPE women [mean ± SD
