Platelet expression of stromal-cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1): an indicator for ACS? Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) along with myocardial ischemic injury are the leading causes for chest pain. Platelet surface expression of stromal-cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) is enhanced during ischemic events and may play an important role in trafficking hematopoietic progenitor cells for tissue regeneration and neovascularization. This study examined the platelet surface expression of SDF-1 in patients with chest pain.We consecutively evaluated 1000 patients, who were admitted to the emergency department with chest pain. Platelet surface expression of GPIb and SDF-1 was determined by two-color whole blood flow cytometry.Patients with ACS showed significantly enhanced SDF-1 expression on admission compared to patients with other causes such as stable angina pectoris (SAP) and other origin of chest pain (CPO) (ACS vs. SAP/CPO (mean fluorescence intensity (MFI)± SD): 39.7 ± 26.3 vs. SAP: 37.6 ± 31.5P=0.045Platelet SDF-1 surface expression was significantly enhanced in patients with ACS compared to SAP or CPO. Determination of platelet SDF-1 may be useful as an early additional biomarker for cardiovascular risk stratification.
