Massive pulmonary thromboembolism after abdominoplasty and liposuction. Pulmonary embolism is a rare complication of abdominoplasty and liposuction that may result in a fatal consequence. A 65-year-old obese woman presented with complaints of shortness of breath, palpitation, and hypotension (90/60 mmHg) seven weeks after abdominoplasty and liposuction. The electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia, right axis deviation, and right bundle branch block. The chest X-ray showed atelectatic and focally infiltrated areas, and minimal bilateral pleural effusion. Laboratory findings were normal except for D-dimer level (3500 ng/ml). Echocardiography revealed dilated right heart chambers and a thrombus in the left ventricle. Ejection fraction was normal and pulmonary artery pressure was 50 mmHg. Doppler ultrasound showed no signs of thrombosis. Following the diagnosis of pulmonary thromboembolism, the patient received oxygen therapy and heparin infusion. However, the clinical course did not improve, hemodynamic deterioration continued, and the echocardiographic appearance of the thrombus persisted, so thrombolytic therapy with tissue plasminogen activator was administered, which also resulted in no response. In the end, pulmonary embolectomy was performed and the thrombus was successfully extracted. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged on the seventh postoperative day.
