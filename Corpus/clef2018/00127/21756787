Comparison of three HIV antibody confirmatory assay kits in confirming early HIV infection. This study was to compare the performance of three HIV antibody confirmatory assay kits in confirming early HIV infection.Five HIV antibody-positive plasma specimens were ten-fold serially diluted and then detected by ELISA. The above diluted specimens were detected with the following three HIV antibody confirmatory assay kits to analyze their sensitivity, including Wantai-RIBA (Recombinant immunoblot assay, Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy, China), MP-WB (HIV Blot 2.2 WB, MP Biomedicals Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd., Singapore) and INNO-LIA (INNO-LIA(TM) HIV I/II Score, Innogenetics N.V., Belgium), respectively. These kits were further used to detect 48 ELISA-reactive specimens from 11 sets of HIV seroconversion specimens (a total of 48 samples) which were previously detected as HIV antibody-positive by ELISA.When 5 samples were diluted to 100 fold, Wantai-RIBA still can detect them positive. Among the 48 HIV antibody-positive specimens detected with ELISA, the confirmation positive rate for Wantai-RIBA, MP-WB and INNO-LIA were 97.92% (47/48), 81.25% (39/48) and 91.67% (44/48), respectively. There was statistically significant difference between the confirmatory results of Wantai-RIBA and MP-WB (χ(2) = 6.13, P < 0.05), as well as between those of INNO-LIA and MP-WB (χ(2) = 5.48, P < 0.05) however, there was no statistically significant difference between those of Wantai-RIBA and INNO-LIA (χ(2) = 1.33, P > 0.05). For other six HIV seroconversion panels containing indeterminate specimens, the average seroconversion period of time for Wantai-RIBA, MP-WB and INNO-LIA were 0.7, 13.3 and 3.7 days, respectively.Compared with MP-WB, Wantai-RIBA and INNO-LIA could reduce the window period to confirm early HIV infection.
