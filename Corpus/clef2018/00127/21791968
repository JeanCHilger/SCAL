Serum levels of the adipokine zinc-α2-glycoprotein are increased in preeclampsia. Preeclampsia (PE) is associated with facets of the metabolic syndrome and an increased future metabolic and cardiovascular risk for mother and newborn. Recently, zinc-α2-glycoprotein (ZAG) has been proposed as a new adipokine involved in the pathogenesis of obesity.In the current study, we investigated ZAG serum levels in PE patients as compared to healthy gestational age-matched controls.We quantified serum concentrations of ZAG in patients with PE (no.=37) as compared to healthy gestational age-matched controls (no.=37) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Furthermore, association of this adipokine with renal function, glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as inflammation was studied.Median serum ZAG levels were 1.4-fold higher in PE patients (58.8 mg/l) as compared to controls (41.9 mg/l) (p<0.01). Furthermore, circulating ZAG was positively correlated to systolic and diastolic blood pressure, creatinine, triglycerides, and leptin in univariate analyses. In multiple regression analysis, creatinine remained independently associated with ZAG.We demonstrate that maternal ZAG serum concentrations are significantly increased in PE. Furthermore, renal function is an independent predictor of circulating ZAG.
