Safe esophageal reconstruction by ileocolic interposition. Many techniques have been proposed for esophageal reconstruction after esophagectomy when a gastric tube cannot be employed. There are two essential criteria for such a substitute: substitute length and sufficient blood supply. We propose ileocolic interposition as an easy and safe option. Two technical aspects contributing to the high success rate of this method are the preservation of an intact arterial network allowing normal blood flow to the ileocolic area, and the ability to quantify blood flow using a Doppler pulse flow meter in six cases. These are enabled by a long (up to 20cm) ileocolic segment. The preservation of the right colic artery is important, because its interruption would reduce blood supply to the long ileum segment. Between July 2003 and October 2008, we used this method in six patients in whom a gastric tube was not an option. We assessed perioperative morbidity and swallowing difficulties in each patient, quantifying dysphagia on scale of 0 to 4. There was no mortality and no anastomotic leak. There was one wound infection, and in one patient, recurrent nerve paralysis was observed. The postoperative hospital stay was 29.5 ± 10.8 days. The average dysphagia score for the six patients was 0.17 ± 0.41 after the operation. All patients can eat normally, without any dietary limitations. Ileocolonic interposition after esophagectomy requires careful assessment of the vascular supply. In this small series, morbidity was low and there was no perioperative mortality. We believe that this is an easy and safe method of reconstruction after esophagectomy in cases in whom a gastric tube cannot be used as a substitute.
