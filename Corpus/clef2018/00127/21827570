Levels of soluble endothelial selectin in umbilical cord serum are influenced by gestational age and histological chorioamnionitis, but not by pre-eclampsia. The aim of this study was to examine the factors that influence soluble endothelial selectin (sE-selectin) levels in umbilical cord serum.sE-selectin levels in umbilical cord serum were measured in 144 patients using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We examined the association of sE-selectin levels with gestational age, pre-eclampsia (PE), histological chorioamnionitis (HCAM), preterm premature rupture of membranes, magnesium sulfate use, birthweight, and placental weight.A significant positive correlation was observed between sE-selectin levels and gestational age in the patients who had neither PE nor HCAM (r = 0.559, P < 0.0001). This statistically positive correlation persisted in patients with PE without HCAM (n = 25, r = 0.644, P < 0.001), but not in patients with HCAM without PE (n = 58, r = 0.102, P = 0.448). In matched gestational age analysis, sE-selectin levels were increased in the presence of HCAM (P = 0.0006), but were not influenced by the presence of PE (P = 0.127), preterm premature rupture of membranes (P = 0.352) or magnesium sulfate use (P = 0.337).sE-selectin levels in umbilical cord serum were positively correlated with gestational weeks. sE-selectin levels in umbilical cord serum were higher in mothers with HCAM but not with PE, when compared with gestational-age-matched controls.
