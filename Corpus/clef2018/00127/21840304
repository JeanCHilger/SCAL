ADAMTS13, FVIII, von Willebrand factor, ABO blood group assessment in preeclampsia. Preeclampsia (PE) is a multifactorial disease characterized by high blood pressure and proteinuria after the 20th week of pregnancy. PE is associated with fibrin deposition in placental microcirculation and intrauterine fetal growth retardation. We evaluated FVIII activity, VWF and ADAMTS13 plasma levels, according to O and "non O" blood groups, in women with severe PE (sPE).This case-control study included 140 women 55 pregnant with sPE, 35 normotensive pregnant and 50 non-pregnant women. VWF and ADAMTS13 antigen levels were assessed by ELISA (American Diagnostica). FVIII activity was measured by automated coagulometric method (Dade Behring) and ABO blood groups phenotyping was performed by indirect technique.FVIII activity and VWF levels were significantly higher comparing either sPE to normotensive pregnant (P=0.01 P=0.05) and to non-pregnant women (P=0.00 in both cases) or normotensive pregnant and non-pregnant women (P=0.00 in both cases). A significant decrease in ADAMTS13 levels was observed comparing either sPE to normotensive pregnant (P=0.02) and non-pregnant women (P=0.00) or normotensive pregnant and non-pregnant women (P=0.00). FVIII activity and VWF levels were associated to O and "non O" blood groups only in non-pregnant women.The increase of FVIII activity and VWF levels and the decrease of ADAMTS13 in sPE are not associated to O and "non O" blood groups. These alterations in hemostatic markers in sPE largely surpass those physiologically determined by ABO blood groups influence and may have masked the effect of O and "non O" groups in this disease. A concomitant analysis of VWF levels and ADAMTS13 activity and antigenic levels will be important to clarify the imbalance between these parameters found in sPE in the present study.
