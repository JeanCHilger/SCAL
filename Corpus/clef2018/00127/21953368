Sonographic detection of transient gas in the portal vein in an infant following abdominal surgery: a possible sign of adhesive small bowel obstruction. We present a case of sonographically detected transient gas in the portal vein in a 4.5-month-old infant who had a history of two consecutive jejunectomies due to jejunal stenoses and was admitted to our hospital with clinical and laboratory findings consistent with a subacute small bowel obstruction and dehydration. Sonography excluded other pathologies and the patient was treated conservatively with success. The presence of gas in the portal vein could be a sign of an underlying mechanical obstacle, as another episode of small bowel obstruction 1 month later required surgical treatment of adhesive intestinal obstruction.
