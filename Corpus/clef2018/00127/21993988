Pulmonary thromboembolism. Pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) has been associated with many diseases. Clot formation is a consequence of hypercoagulability, blood stasis, and damage to the endothelium of blood vessels, a set of changes known as the Virchow triad. Diagnosing PTE may be difficult because common clinical signs, including tachypnea, dyspnea, and hypoxemia, are not pathognomonic for the disease. The initial workup for PTE should include arterial blood gas analysis and thoracic radiography. If there is a strong clinical suspicion for PTE, further tests are indicated, such as D-dimer measurement, thromboelastography, and advanced imaging.
