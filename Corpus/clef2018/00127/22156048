Amyloid imaging with AV45 ((18)F-florbetapir) in a cognitively normal AβPP duplication carrier. We report the case of a 62-year-old asymptomatic carrier of AβPP gene duplication. He was investigated by MRI and the amyloid ligand (18)F-AV45, and compared to Alzheimer's disease patients (n = 11) and healthy controls (n = 11). The neuropsychological examination was normal. Cortical thickness and AV45 retention were comparable to Alzheimer's disease patients. AβPP duplication was diagnosed because cerebral amyloid angiopathy and Alzheimer's disease pathology were found on the neuropathological examination of his youngest brother, who died at 42 from intracerebral hemorrhage. This is the first description of a pre-symptomatic AβPP duplication carrier over 60, despite widespread cerebral amyloid angiopathy, "Alzheimer's like" atrophy, and amyloid deposition.
