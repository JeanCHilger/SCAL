Chitotriosidase, interleukin-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha levels in mild preeclampsia. Chitotriosidase (ChT) is an activated macrophage marker. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) are mainly produced macrophages. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between serum ChT activity, levels of TNF-α and IL-1β in patients with mild preeclampsia and normal pregnancy.An overall 64 cases, 32 healthy pregnant control women (control group) and 32 women with mild preeclamptic patients (study group), were enrolled in this study. At the beginning of the study, all study participants were matched for age and gestational age. Serum ChT activity was measured by fluorometer TNF-α and IL-1β levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.The mean age, gestational week, parity and gravida were similar in the two groups (p > 0.05). Serum ChT activity was significantly higher in the preeclampsia group compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Levels of TNF-α and IL-1β in patients with mild preeclampsia were similar compared to the control group (p > 0.05). In the PE group, serum ChT activity was not correlated with TNF-α and IL-1β.Mild preeclampsia is found associated with higher ChT activity. This result suggests that activated macrophages play a role in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. This suggestion needs to be confirmed in future studies with larger populations.
