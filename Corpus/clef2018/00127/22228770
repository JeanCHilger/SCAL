Transcription factor GATA4 is activated but not required for insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1)-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) promotes a physiological type of cardiac hypertrophy and has therapeutic effects in heart disease. Here, we report the relationship of IGF1 to GATA4, an essential transcription factor in cardiac hypertrophy and cell survival. In cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, we compared the responses to IGF1 (10 nmol/liter) and phenylephrine (PE, 20 Î¼mol/liter), a known GATA4 activator, in concentrations promoting a similar extent of hypertrophy. IGF1 and PE both increased nuclear accumulation of GATA4 and phosphorylation at Ser(105) (PE, 2.4-fold IGF1, 1.8-fold
