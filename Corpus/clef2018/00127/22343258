Obstructive giant cardiac tumour in a patient with chest pain and acute respiratory insufficiency. A 77-year-old woman presented with dyspnoea and respiratory-related thoracic pain, which was accompanied by dizziness and fatigue but no syncopal attacks. Auscultation of the heart disclosed an opening snap with mid-diastolic murmur. Laboratory assessment revealed no abnormalities but an elevated D-dimer level (1.49â€Šmg/l). Electrocardiography was normal. The chest radiograph showed an enlarged heart without other abnormalities. Computed tomography (CT) scan for a suspected diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was performed. The CT scan did not reveal pulmonary embolism, but a large cardiac tumour in the left atrium.
