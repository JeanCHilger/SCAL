Venous thromboembolism prevention with fondaparinux 1.5 mg in renally impaired patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery. A real-world, prospective, multicentre, cohort study. Despite the need for effective and safe thromboprophylactic drugs for patients with renal impairment, clinical trial data on anticoagulant agents are limited in this population. The study aim was to assess in the real-world setting the use of the once-daily 1.5 mg reduced dosage regimen of fondaparinux available for this context. In this prospective cohort study, patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 20-50 ml/minute, undergoing total hip (THR) or knee (TKR) replacement or hip fracture surgery (HFS) received fondaparinux thromboprophylaxis. Main clinical outcomes were bleeding (major/clinically relevant non-major), symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) and death. Overall, 442 patients (353 women median age: 82 years
