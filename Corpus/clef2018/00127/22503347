Promoter region polymorphisms in the transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFβ1) gene and serum TGFβ1 concentration in preeclamptic and control Iranian women. Preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy associated disorder characterized by hypertension and proteinuria, which causes neonatal and maternal morbidity and mortality. The Th1/Th2 cytokine paradigm of the immune adaptation in pregnancy is now expanded to include Th1/Th2/Th17 and regulatory T (Treg) cells. Among cytokines, TGFβ1 has properties that justify evaluation of its role in PE etiopathology. In this investigation the polymorphisms of the TGFβ1 gene at promoter region, positions -800G→A and -509C→T, were studied in 142 PE and 140 normal pregnant female subjects using PCR-RFLP. Additionally, serum TGFβ1 was determined by ELISA. At position -800G→A genotypes and allele frequencies showed no significant differences between PE patients (GG 73.9% GA 21.1%
