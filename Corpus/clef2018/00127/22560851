Depressive symptoms, perceived social support, and prothrombotic measures in patients with venous thromboembolism. Psychosocial factors have been associated with both a prothrombotic state and an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). We examined the relation of depressive symptoms and social support with D-dimer, an integrative measure of enhanced coagulation activity, and several additional prothrombotic measures in patients with VTE.We studied 173 patients with a previous deep venous thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism (mean age ± SD 45 ± 14 years, 55% men). Clinical and lab assessments took place ≥ 3 months after VTE and ≥ 1 month after discontinuation of oral anticoagulants. The patients rated depressive symptoms and social support by validated questionnaires.After adjusting for sociodemographic and medical covariates, interactions emerged between depressive symptoms and social support for D-dimer (p=0.012) and aPTT (p=0.002). As opposed to patients with high levels of social support, those with low levels of social support showed a direct association of depressive symptoms with D-dimer (r=0.19, p=0.014) and an inverse relationship with aPTT (r=-0.14, p<0.09). Depressive symptoms were associated with levels of thrombin-antithrombin complex (r=0.19, p=0.016). Greater social support was associated with prolonged aPTT (r=0.16, p=0.046). There were no significant associations of depressive symptoms and social support with D-dimer, fibrinogen, FII:C, FV:C, FVII:C, FVIII:C, FX:C, INR, and thrombin time.Depressive symptoms are associated with enhanced coagulation activity in patients with VTE, particularly so in those who perceive low levels of social support. Conversely, high levels of social support may contribute directly and through buffering the effect of depressive symptoms to attenuated clotting activity in VTE patients.
