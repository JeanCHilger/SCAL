A therapeutic conundrum: recurrent cystic-fibrosis-related haemoptysis complicated by acute pulmonary embolism. The authors present the case of an older patient with cystic fibrosis (CF) and recurrent haemoptysis complicated by acute pulmonary embolism. The patient was treated successfully with a combination of anticoagulation and bronchial artery embolisation. The management of CF-related haemoptysis, the impact of an ageing CF population and the incidence of thromboembolic disease in CF are discussed.
