Maternal and fetal plasma platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase activity and distribution in pre-eclampsia. Distribution of platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) in lipoproteins plays important roles in the onset of inflammation and atherosclerosis. We hypothesized that women with pre-eclampsia (PE), showing signs of inflammation and oxidative stress, and their fetuses have aberrations of PAF-AH activity and distribution.Maternal and fetal plasma PAF-AH activity, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-associated PAF-AH (H-PAF-AH) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-associated PAF-AH (L-PAF-AH) were examined in women with PE (n = 127) and in women with uncomplicated pregnancies (n = 88).The neonates of women with severe PE (n = 42) had significantly higher plasma PAF-AH, L-PAF-AH activities, and ratio of L-PAF-AH to H-PAF-AH activities than the neonates of women with normal pregnancies (n = 83). The mothers with severe PE (n = 106) and their neonates presented a significantly higher atherogenic index (AI) and triglyceride (TG)/HDL cholesterol (C) ratio than the control mothers and their neonates. The ratio of L-PAF-AH to H-PAF-AH activities correlated positively with TG levels, TG/HDL(C) ratio, and AI and negatively with HDL(C) levels in the neonates of women with PE.The neonates of women with severe PE presented with a chronic inflammation status, increased oxidative stress, and unfavorable lipid changes, which may potentially link to related complications responsible for oxidative stress and inflammation in later life.
