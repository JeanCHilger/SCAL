Protein Z deficiency in unexplained affinity to thromboses, bleedings or abortions. A protein Z deficiency is presumably related with a threefold risk of venous and arterial thrombosis. Mucosal bleedings and post-operative haematomas can occur more frequently. This is seen in an increased in vivo bleeding time without other plasmatic coagulation disorders or thrombopathies. Pregnancy complications, especially abortions before the 15th week of gestation, are described as well.Since May 2011 the plasmatic concentration of protein Z has been tested in 684 patients of the Hämostaseologicum.In 74 patients a protein Z deficiency has been found. In other 45 patients protein Z was reduced because of the intake of phenprocoumon or coumadin. Of the 74 patients with diminished protein Z concentration 39 were marginally decreased (protein Z 1000-1500 µg/l). Of the 35 patients with a protein Z concentration <1000 µg/l 12 had had a thrombosis before (6 strokes, 3 DVT or PE, 1 arterial thrombosis, 1 retinal branch vein occlusion, 1 acute hearing loss). 7 had arterial hypertension, 2 suffered from diabetes mellitus. Of the patients who had a thrombosis 6 had a heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation. 10 had a microcirculation disorder (Raynaud's phenomenon), 4 had had bleeding complications before, 3 had a von Willebrand disease type I, 6 patients had had abortions and 4 were healthy. Of the 39 patients with protein Z concentrations between 1000 and 1500 µg/l 18 had experienced a thrombosis before (9 DVT or PE, 3 myocardial infarctions, 1 CHD, 3 strokes, 1 retinal branch vein occlusion, 1 PAOD I, 1 tinnitus). 5 additionally had arterial hypertension. 13 suffered from Raynaud's phenomenon, of which 7 had a hypotension. Of the patients with thromboses 3 had a heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation and one a protein C deficiency. 7 patients had had an abortion before. Bleeding complications were seen in 4 patients, of which 3 suffered from von Willebrand disease type 1.
