N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide: a useful tool for the detection of acute pulmonary artery embolism in post-surgical patients. Acute pulmonary embolism (APE) is an important clinical problem in patients after major surgery and often remains a difficult diagnosis because of unspecific clinical symptoms. Therefore, we investigated the role of N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) for the detection of APE.In 44 patients with suspected APE referred to the intensive care unit after major surgery, serum NT-proBNP, troponin-I, and D-dimers were measured according to the standard hospital protocol. To definitively confirm or exclude APE, all patients underwent an angiographic CT scan of the thorax.APE was confirmed in 28 and excluded in 16 patients by CT scan. NT-proBNP was significantly (P<0.01) higher in patients with APE [4425 (sd 8826 range 63-35 000) pg ml(-1)] compared with those without [283 (sd 327D-dimer levels are frequently elevated in post-surgical patients and not applicable for confirmation or exclusion of APE. In contrast, NT-proBNP appears to be a useful biomarker for APE diagnosis in the postoperative setting. In the case of NT-proBNP levels below the upper reference limit, haemodynamically relevant APE is unlikely. Troponin-I in contrast is not considered to be helpful.
