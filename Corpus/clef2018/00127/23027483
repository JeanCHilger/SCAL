Incidence of venous thromboembolism in fractures around and below the knee with physical prophylaxis. Fractures occurring at the distal part of the lower extremities are recognized to have a relatively lower risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) however, few detailed reports exist on the subject. The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of VTE in fractures around and below the knee. Overall, 109 consecutive patients with fractures around and below the knee who were surgically treated at the authors' hospital were analyzed retrospectively. Physical prophylaxis was performed in all patients. Until April 2009, VTE screening was performed by contrast-enhanced computed tomography or ultrasonography when the D-dimer value did not decline predictably, exceeded 20 μg/mL 5 days after trauma and surgery, or increased above 20 μg/mL after a period of decline. After April 2009, ultrasonography was routinely performed pre- and postoperatively irrespective of the D-dimer value. The patients were divided into 2 groups based on the absence or presence of accompanying injuries, including head, chest, abdominal, or spinal injury and other fractures of the pelvis and lower extremities. Overall, VTE and pulmonary thromboembolism were detected in 28 (25.7%) patients and 5 (4.6%) patients, respectively. All cases were asymptomatic. The VTE incidence rates were 8.6% (former screening) and 40% (newer screening) in patients with isolated fractures and 25% (former screening) and 41.7% (newer screening) in patients with accompanying injuries. The pulmonary thromboembolism incidence rates were 2.9% (former screening) and 0% (newer screening) in patients with isolated fractures and 3.2% (former screening) and 25.0% (newer screening) in patients with accompanying injuries. Surgeons should be vigilant for symptoms of VTE in patients with fractures occurring at the distal part of the lower extremities.
