Mid-gestational gene expression profile in placenta and link to pregnancy complications. Despite the importance of placenta in mediating rapid physiological changes in pregnancy, data on temporal dynamics of placental gene expression are limited. We completed the first transcriptome profiling of human placental gene expression dynamics (GeneChips, AffymetrixÂ® ~47,000 transcripts) from early to mid-gestation (n = 10
