Analysis on anti-vascular inflammatory mechanism in vitro of total flavones from Artemisia anomala. To study the impact of total flavones from Artemisia anomala (TFAS) on activation of macrophages, cell oxidative stress, auto-nitration of CuZn-SOD, platelet aggregation and isolated vascular tension.LPS and IFN-gamma induced activation of macrophages and oxidative stress in rats H2O2 and nitrite induced auto-nitration of CuZn-SODTFAS demonstrated dose dependence (25, 50, 100, 200 mg x L(-1)) on inhibiting induced macrophages NO production from generating, while increasing cell viability and total anti-oxidant capacity. Auto-nitration of CuZn-SOD was suppressed by TFAS in dose dependence (0.5, 5, 50 mg x L(-1)). TFAS showed an inhibitory effect on collagen-induced platelet aggregation at 50 mg x L(-1) and an endothelium-dependent relaxation effect on PE-induced vasoconstriction at 1 g x L(-1).TFAS shows effect on anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation, anti-nitration, anti-platelet aggregation and vasodilatation in experiment in vitro, which may inhibit vascular inflammatory by regulating multiple target points. It is among material bases for promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis.
