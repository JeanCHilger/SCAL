Serum levels of growth arrest specific protein 6 are increased in preeclampsia. Preeclampsia (PE) contributes to maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Moreover, it is associated with an increased future metabolic and cardiovascular risk for mother and newborn. Recently, growth arrest specific protein (Gas) 6 has been introduced as a novel metabolic risk factor with anti-angiogenic, pro-atherogenic, and pro-adipogenic properties. In the current study, we investigated serum concentrations of Gas6 in patients with PE (n=51) as compared to healthy, age-matched controls (n=51) during and 6 months after pregnancy. Furthermore, association of Gas6 with markers of renal function, glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as inflammation, was assessed in all individuals. Median maternal Gas6 serum levels adjusted for body mass index and gestational age at blood sampling were significantly increased in PE patients (5.7 μg/l) as compared to healthy, age-matched pregnant women (4.6 μg/l) (p<0.05). Furthermore, Gas6 concentrations positively correlated with blood pressure, creatinine, free fatty acids, C-reactive protein, leptin, and adiponectin during pregnancy. Moreover, leptin and adiponectin remained independently associated with Gas6 levels in multivariate analysis. Gas6 serum levels 6 months after pregnancy were not significantly different between former PE and control patients. Taken together, maternal Gas6 serum concentrations are significantly increased in PE during pregnancy. Furthermore, the adipokines leptin and adiponectin are independent predictors of circulating Gas6 in pregnant women.
