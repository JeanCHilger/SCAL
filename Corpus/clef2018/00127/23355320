Sonographic confirmation of the correct placement of a nasoenteral tube in a woman with hyperemesis gravidarum: case report. Hyperemesis gravidarum is a serious systemic disorder of pregnant women characterized by intractable vomiting resulting in metabolic, biochemical, and hematologic changes. Enteral nutrition has been used successfully and has a lower complication rate than parenteral nutrition. Tube feeding requires location of the feeding tube tip before the infusion of nutritional substance is started. We report a case of assisted feeding tube tip location using real time sonography in a pregnant women treated for hyperemesis gravidarum. Sonographic examination may be used as an alternative to x-ray for the confirmation of feeding tube location in pregnant women and thus eliminate exposure of the fetus to ionizing radiation.
