The usefulness of natriuretic peptides measurements in the diagnostics of chosen cardiovascular diseases. Natriuretic peptides compose the group of neurohormones produced by the myocardium in response to its walls stretching caused by the volume or pressure overload. They restrain the sodium kidney reabsorbtion, thus increasing the diuresis and natriuresis. They also participate in blood pressure, initial load as well as the water-mineral balance regulation. The main representatives of this group are ANP (atrial natriuretic peptide) and BNP (brain netriuretic peptide). With regard to slow dynamics of the serum levels changes, the measurements of BNP play an important role in cardiological diagnotics. Its serum concentration raises in these cardiovascular diseases that are connected with the left ventricle overload. So it can be treated as a specific left ventricle dysfunction marker, whereas its high concentrations correlate with the functional class according to NYHA. It also can be used in risk stratification in patients with the acute coronary syndrome and pulmonary embolism, as well as helping to differentiate the pulmonary and cardiac causes of acute dyspnoea. The serum level of NT-proBNP (N-terminal propeptide of brain natriuretic peptide) is also the independent predictive factor of the recurrence of atrial fibrillation after the restoring the sinus rhythm.
