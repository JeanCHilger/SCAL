Amyloid PET/MRI in the differential diagnosis of dementia. The potential of brain imaging has grown rapidly with new modalities, hybrid combinations of existing modalities, and novel metabolic tracers. F-florbetapir is an amyloid plaque-binding molecule labeled to F that allows positron imaging of the amyloid deposition in the brain. This protein deposition is known to be one of the features in Alzheimer disease and therefore can be of interest in the differential diagnosis of dementia. We present 2 cases combining the new hybrid imaging modality PET/MRI, which offers molecular and morphological information, with F-florbetapir in the differential diagnosis of dementia.
