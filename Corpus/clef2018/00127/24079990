Transient left ventricular and stomach apical ballooning syndromes: when the trigger is also a clinical emergency. A 59-year-old woman was referred to our emergency department because of epigastric pain and incoercible vomit. Electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevation in anterior-lateral leads, but coronary angiogram revealed normal coronary tree and left ventricular angiography showed apical and midventricular akinesis with preserved basal systolic function: a diagnosis of apical ballooning syndrome was made. During the following days, the patient complained about persistent abdominal pain, and a nasogastric tube drained more than 1000 cc of dark fecaloid material. Urgent abdominal computed tomography scan showed a mural thrombus in the apex of the left ventricle and a huge diaphragmatic hernia through which more than one-half of the stomach was herniated and presented a sort of “apical stomach ballooning.” Gastropexy was done surgical diagnosis was a type IV giant diaphragmatic hernia complicated by recent gastric volvulus caused by rotation along the longitudinal cardiopyloric axis. Type IV giant diaphragmatic hernia is relatively rare, representing only about 5% to 7% of all hernias. Gastric volvulus is a severe complication, with acute mortality reported to be as high as 30% to 50%. In our case, a severe life-threatening condition as gastric volvulus triggered an apical ballooning syndrome, a transient cardiomyopathy, usually induced by emotional stressors with a long-term good prognosis. Apical ballooning syndrome must be considered an epiphenomenon of other organic diseases that may have an important role in the prognosis of the patient not only in acute but also in chronic setting. Only early determination of the true cause of apical ballooning syndrome ensures a proper treatment.
