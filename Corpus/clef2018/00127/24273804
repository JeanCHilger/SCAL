Esophageal stricture secondary to drug-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis presenting in an adult: an unusual complication of a rare disease. Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is an idiosyncratic, potentially life-threatening skin disease characterized by widespread inflammation and necrosis of the epidermis and mucous membranes. It may result in narrowing of the esophageal lumen through fibrosis and esophageal stricture in rare situations, mostly encountered in children. To the best of our knowledge, we report the first case of esophageal stricture secondary to allopurinol-induced TEN in an adult patient. A 70-year-old male presented to our clinic with severe dysphagia secondary to allopurinol-induced TEN involving his mouth and esophagus. At the time of presentation the patient had a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy feeding tube and was unable to handle his oral secretions. Endoscopy revealed near complete proximal esophageal stricture. A bidirectional esophageal dilatation procedure via the mouth and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy site was successfully performed over a guidewire for treatment of this patient. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with dilation was performed in a regular anterograde fashion five times over the next three months. Triamcinolone acetonide was injected using Carr-Locke injection needle from ultrasound endoscopy during the last three sessions. He currently tolerates a regular diet without difficulty.
