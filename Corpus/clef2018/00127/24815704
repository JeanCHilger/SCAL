Right-sided congenital diaphragmatic hernia: A tertiary centre's experience over 25 years. To provide analysis on infants treated for right-sided congenital diaphragmatic hernia (RCDH) including mortality, neonatal morbidities, and associated congenital anomalies.We reviewed records of infants admitted with RCDH from 1985 to 2010.A total of 160 infants with CDH were identified of them 22 infants had RCDH, 14 (64%) were male and eight (36%) were female. Eleven of the 22 infants died (50%), of which seven (64%) were male, and four (36%) were female. Three infants (13.6%) were diagnosed prenatally, and 19 (86.4%) were diagnosed postnatally. A statistically significant association with mortality was observed for low five minute Apgar score (OR = 8Low five minute Apgar score, and high alveolar-arterial gradient were significant predictors of mortality. RCDH is associated with high mortality (50%), prolonged length of stay and other anomalies. In recent years, we observed an improving trend for survival.
