Quantification of 18F-florbetapir PET: comparison of two analysis methods. (18)F-Florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) can be used to image amyloid burden in the human brain. A previously developed research method has been shown to have a high test-retest reliability and good correlation between standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) and amyloid burden at autopsy. The goal of this study was to determine how well SUVRs computed using the research method could be reproduced using an automatic quantification method, developed for clinical use.Two methods for the quantitative analysis of (18)F-florbetapir PET were compared in a diverse clinical population of 604 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and in a group of 74 younger healthy controls (YHC). Cortex to cerebellum SUVRs were calculated using the research method, which is based on SPM, yielding 'research SUVRs', and using syngo.PET Amyloid Plaque, yielding 'sPAP SUVRs'.Mean cortical SUVRs calculated using the two methods for the 678 subjects were correlated (r = 0.99). Linear regression of sPAP SUVRs on research SUVRs was used to convert the research method SUVR threshold for florbetapir positivity of 1.10 to a corresponding threshold of 1.12 for sPAP. Using the corresponding thresholds, categorization of SUVR values were in agreement between research and sPAP SUVRs for 96.3 % of the ADNI images. SUVRs for all YHC were below the corresponding thresholds.Automatic florbetapir PET quantification using sPAP yielded cortex to cerebellum SUVRs which were correlated and in good agreement with the well-established research method. The research SUVR threshold for florbetapir positivity was reliably converted to a corresponding threshold for sPAP SUVRs.
