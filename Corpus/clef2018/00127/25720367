Vascular Anomalies Associated with Esophageal Atresia andÂ Tracheoesophageal Fistula. To report the incidence of congenital vascular anomalies in a cohort of patients with esophageal atresia (EA) and tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) while describing the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and consequences, and to evaluate the diagnostic value of esophagram in diagnosing an aberrant right subclavian artery (ARSA).All patients born with EA/TEF between 2005 and 2013 were studied. Preoperative echocardiography reports, surgical descriptions of primary esophageal repair, and esophagrams were reviewed retrospectively.Of the 76 children born with EA/TEF included in this study, 14 (18%) had a vascular malformation. The incidence of a right aortic arch (RAA) was 6% (5 of 76), and that of an aberrant right subclavian artery (ARSA) was 12% (9 of 76). RAA was diagnosed in the neonatal period by echocardiography (4 of 5) or surgery (1 of 5), and ARSA was diagnosed by echocardiography (7 of 9) or later on the esophagram (2 of 9). Respiratory and/or digestive symptoms occurred in 9 of the 14 patients with vascular malformation. Both long-gap EA and severe cardiac malformations necessitating surgery were significantly associated with vascular anomalies (P<.05). The sensitivity of the esophagram for diagnosing ARSA was 66%, the specificity was 98%, the negative predictive value was 95%, and the positive predictive value was 85%.ARSA and RAA have an incidence of 12% and 6% respectively, in patients with EA/TEF. A computed tomography angioscan is recommended to rule out such malformations when stenting of the esophagus is indicated, before esophageal replacement surgery, and when prolonged (>2 weeks) use of a nasogastric tube is considered.
