Improved power for characterizing longitudinal amyloid-β PET changes and evaluating amyloid-modifying treatments with a cerebral white matter reference region. In this article, we describe an image analysis strategy with improved power for tracking longitudinal amyloid-β (Aβ) PET changes and evaluating Aβ-modifying treatments.Our aims were to compare the power of template-based cerebellar, pontine, and cerebral white matter reference regions to track 24-mo florbetapir standardized uptake value (SUV) ratio (SUVR) changes to relate those changes to 24-mo clinical declinesAs predicted, cerebral-to-white matter SUVR changes were significantly less variable and had significantly greater power to detect 24-mo fibrillar Aβ increases and evaluate Aβ-modifying treatment effects in Aβ+ pAD, MCI, and NC subjects and cognitively normal APOE4 carriers. They were also distinguished by the ability to detect significant associations between 24-mo Aβ increases and clinical declines.A cerebral white matter reference region may improve the power to track longitudinal fibrillar Aβ increases, to characterize their relationship to longitudinal clinical declines, and to evaluate Aβ-modifying treatments in randomized clinical trials.
