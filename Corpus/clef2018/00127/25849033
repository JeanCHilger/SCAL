Florbetapir PET, FDG PET, and MRI in Down syndrome individuals with and without Alzheimer's dementia. Down syndrome (DS) is associated with amyloid b (Ab) deposition.We characterized imaging measurements of regional fibrillar Ab burden, cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (rCMRgl), gray matter volumes (rGMVs), and age associations in 5 DS with dementia (DS/AD1), 12 DS without dementia (DS/AD2), and 9 normal controls (NCs).There were significant group differences in mean standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) for florbetapir with DS/AD1 having the highest, followed by DS/AD2, followed by NC. For [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, posterior cingulate rCMRgl in DS/AD1 was significantly reduced compared with DS/AD2 and NC. For volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (vMRI), hippocampal volumes were significantly reduced for the DS/AD1 compared with DS/AD2 and NC. Age-related SUVR increases and rCMRgl reductions were greater in DS participants than in NCs.DS is associated with fibrillar Ab, rCMRgl, and rGMV alterations in the dementia stage and before the presence of clinical decline. This study provides a foundation for the studies needed to inform treatment and prevention in DS.
