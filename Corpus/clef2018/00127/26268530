GWAS of longitudinal amyloid accumulation on 18F-florbetapir PET in Alzheimer's disease implicates microglial activation gene IL1RAP. Brain amyloid deposition is thought to be a seminal event in Alzheimer's disease. To identify genes influencing Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, we performed a genome-wide association study of longitudinal change in brain amyloid burden measured by (18)F-florbetapir PET. A novel association with higher rates of amyloid accumulation independent from APOE (apolipoprotein E) Îµ4 status was identified in IL1RAP (interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein rs12053868-G
