Technical Considerations in Brain Amyloid PET Imaging with 18F-Florbetapir. Technical factors play a critical role in the production of best-quality amyloid PET images for interpretation. This article provides specific instructions and general technical information about PET brain scanning of Î²-amyloid neuritic plaques. The focus of tracer-specific information will be on (18)F-florbetapir (indications, contraindications, dosing, administration, uptake time, scanning time, acquisition, processing, biodistribution, radiation dose, adverse events, and display). General scanning information relevant to all amyloid-imaging agents will be also be presented (e.g., mechanism of uptake, safe handling, positioning, prevention of patient motion, processing, and artifacts).
