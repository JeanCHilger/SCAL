Non-Linear Association between Cerebral Amyloid Deposition and White Matter Microstructure in Cognitively Healthy Older Adults. Cerebral amyloid-Î² accumulation and changes in white matter (WM) microstructure are imaging characteristics in clinical Alzheimer's disease and have also been reported in cognitively healthy older adults. However, the relationship between amyloid deposition and WM microstructure is not well understood. Here, we investigated the impact of quantitative cerebral amyloid load on WM microstructure in a group of cognitively healthy older adults. AV45-positron emission tomography and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scans of forty-four participants (age-range: 60 to 89 years) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were analyzed. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (DR), and axial diffusivity (DA) were calculated to characterize WM microstructure. Regression analyses demonstrated non-linear (quadratic) relationships between amyloid deposition and FA, MD, as well as RD in widespread WM regions. At low amyloid burden, higher deposition was associated with increased FA as well as decreased MD and DR. At higher amyloid burden, higher deposition was associated with decreased FA as well as increased MD and DR. Additional regression analyses demonstrated an interaction effect between amyloid load and global WM FA, MD, DR, and DA on cognition, suggesting that cognition is only affected when amyloid is increasing and WM integrity is decreasing. Thus, increases in FA and decreases in MD and RD with increasing amyloid load at low levels of amyloid burden may indicate compensatory processes that preserve cognitive functioning. Potential mechanisms underlying the observed non-linear association between amyloid deposition and DTI metrics of WM microstructure are discussed.
