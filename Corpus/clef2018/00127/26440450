Imaging β-amyloid using [(18)F]flutemetamol positron emission tomography: from dosimetry to clinical diagnosis. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ) is hypothesized to result in a series of secondary neurodegenerative processes, leading ultimately to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss. Since the advent of the first Aβ-specific positron emission tomography (PET) ligand, (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B ([(11)C]PIB), several (18)F ligands have been developed that circumvent the limitations of [(11)C]PIB tied to its short half-life. To date, three such compounds have been approved for clinical use by the US and European regulatory bodies, including [(18)F]AV-45 ([(18)F]florbetapir Amyvid™), [(18)F]-BAY94-9172 ([(18)F]florbetaben
