Radiologic Retrograde Gastrostomy Tube Insertions Without the Use of Barium: Implications for Radiation Dose in Children. Historically, percutaneous radiologic retrograde gastrostomy tube insertions in children were performed using barium to opacify the colon. The purpose of this study was to examine whether performing radiologic gastrostomy tube insertions without barium affects patient radiation dose.The method of radiologic gastrostomy tube insertion without barium significantly reduced patient dose, fluoroscopy time, dose-area product (DAP), and weight-and time-adjusted DAP.
