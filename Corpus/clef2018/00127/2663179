Acute respiratory emergencies in emergency treatment of the injured athlete. Exercise and physical fitness are becoming increasingly popular in our society. As a result there are more individuals who are at risk for the development of acute respiratory emergencies associated with sports and athletics. EIB is a common feature of asthma and is characterized by a postexercise fall in FEV1 of more than 10 per cent. Although a variety of medications have been used for the prevention of EIB, cromolyn sodium and inhaled adrenergic agonists have been shown to be the most effective. EIA and cholinergic urticaria are two physical allergies in which hypotension can be brought on by exercise. In some individuals, EIA develops only in association with the ingestion of a particular food. Associated with sports and recreational activities in alpine areas is the risk of developing acute high-altitude medical problems. One of the most dramatic and potentially life threatening is high-altitude pulmonary edema. The management of this condition can be problematic, particularly if rapid descent to lower elevations is not possible. Although rare, spontaneous pneumothorax and pulmonary emboli do develop in the otherwise well-conditioned athlete. These entities must be considered when the physician evaluates any athlete in whom acute cough and dyspnea develop.
