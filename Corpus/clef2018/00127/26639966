Cerebrospinal Fluid Anti-Amyloid-β Autoantibodies and Amyloid PET in Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy-Related Inflammation. We report a biomarker and genetic evaluation of four patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy-related inflammation (CAA-ri) treated with corticosteroids. Patients presented with focal symptomatology and cognitive impairment. MRI revealed cortical microbleeds and asymmetrical hyperintense white matter lesions (WML). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker analyses showed increased anti-Aβ autoantibodies, t-Tau, and p-Tau and decreased Aβ40 and Aβ42. After treatment, focal symptomatology disappeared, and WML and anti-Aβ autoantibodies decreased. The APOEɛ4 allele was overrepresented. Florbetapir-PET showed cortical deposition with lower retention in swollen areas. In the case of suspected CAA-ri, both CSF anti-Aβ autoantibodies levels and Florbetapir-PET could provide highly useful data to guide the correct diagnosis.
