Gallbladder response to enteral lipids in injured patients. Severely injured patients are at risk for complications of gallbladder stasis in a spectrum from sludge formation and cystic duct occlusion by inspissation and, subsequently, acalculous cholecystitis. In a double-blind randomized trial, the effect of enteral lipids on the ability of the gallbladder to clear itself was tested. The gallbladder was assessed by ultrasonography for acute contractions, sludge and dilatation on days 1, 3, and 7 after injury. There were no significant differences between patients who received enteral lipids and controls. Both groups showed modest enlargement of the gallbladder and failure of contraction. In a population at risk for biliary stasis following severe trauma, standard enteral lipids did not elicit, acutely or chronically, an appropriate reflexive evacuation of the gallbladder.
