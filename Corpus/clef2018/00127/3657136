Pulmonary microembolism: a cause of lung injury. Microthrombi found in the pulmonary capillaries in patients dying with post-traumatic pulmonary insufficiency suggests that pulmonary microembolism (PME) may be etiologically important, but a temporal relationship has not been demonstrated. We used a modified Lim-Blaisdell model of PME to cause a severe ischemic soft tissue injury in dogs. The appearance of microaggregates (MA) in the venous circulation was measured using a laser optical scanning technique. The effect of MA on pulmonary physiologic and histologic parameters was measured and compared to control animals. In the ischemic soft tissue injury group, following restoration of local circulation, the platelet count dropped by 72% (P less than 0.00002), the number of MA increased by 800% (P less than 0.00002), the mean pulmonary artery pressure (PA) increased from 15.6 to 32 mm Hg (P less than 0.00002), and electron micrographs of lung obtained at 4 hr after ischemic insult revealed PM with severe lung injury that was consistent with a capillary membrane leak. The control group never demonstrated a significant change in platelets, MA, PA, or histologic lung injury. These findings imply that MA found in the pulmonary microcirculation are temporally related to the development of physiologic and anatomic lung abnormalities.
