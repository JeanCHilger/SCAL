Management of an infant with prenatal ultrasound diagnosis of upper airway obstruction. We report a case in which a cervical teratoma was diagnosed antenatally in the mid third trimester. In anticipation of potential upper airway obstruction, resources were mobilized to the operating room at the time of the planned cesarean section. The neonate was unable to breathe, but his airway was secured without delay. There was no evidence of cerebral anoxia initially or at one year follow-up. As prenatal diagnosis by ultrasound becomes more refined, the otolaryngologist will play an increasing role in perinatal decision making and anticipated emergencies at the time of delivery. Airway obstruction of various causes will be the most urgent problem.
