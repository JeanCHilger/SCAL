Changes in coagulation and fibrinolysis after total hip replacement and their relations with deep vein thrombosis. Postoperative changes related to coagulation and fibrinolysis and their correlation with the incidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) were studied in 30 patients undergoing total hip replacement. Pre- and postoperative measurements of fibrinogen, factor Xa, VIII:C, VIIIR:Ag and its electrophoretic mobility, antifactor Xa activity, antithrombin III (AT III) and its electrophoretic mobility in plasma and serum, fibrin monomers, euglobulin lysis time, fibrinogen degradation products (FDP), alpha 2-antiplasmin and plasmin-antiplasmin complexes were determined. DVT was detected by 125I-fibrinogen leg scanning in 11 patients. There was a significant and progressive increase in fibrinogen, VIII:C, VIIIR:Ag, fibrin monomers, FDP and alpha 2-anti-plasmin levels after operation and likewise a prolongation of euglobulin lysis time. There were changes in electrophoretic mobility of AT III in plasma and serum in 12 patients. The presence of plasmin-antiplasmin complexes was demonstrated in 9 patients. No correlation between the changes in coagulation and fibrinolysis and the incidence of postoperative DVT was found. We conclude that important changes occur in several parameters of coagulation and fibrinolysis after total hip replacement. Such changes are not related to the development of postoperative DVT.
