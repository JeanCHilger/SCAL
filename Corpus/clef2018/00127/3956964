A test for the detection of fibrin in the plasma. The article reports on measurements of D dimer, a terminal plasmic lysis product of crosslinked fibrin, with an enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) employing recently developed specific monoclonal antibodies. Due to its sensitivity the test can be used on plasma samples. The D dimer concentrations in patients with deep vein thrombosis diagnosed by laboratory apparatus were significantly increased compared to a control group in one patient with additional pulmonary embolism, the level was even higher. Moderately elevated concentrations of D dimer were observed in the hypercoagulable state of pregnancy, puerperium and during the postoperative course. This reduces the specificity of the test with regard to the recognition of thromboembolic episodes under these conditions. Obstetric patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) showed excessively increased levels of D dimer. Hence, a marker function with regard to the recognition of thromboembolic disease can be attributed to the D dimer
