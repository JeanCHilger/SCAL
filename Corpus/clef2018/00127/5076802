The detection of fibrinogen-fibrin degradation products by means of a new antibody-coated latex particle. A rapid slide test for the detection of degradation products of fibrinogen/fibrin (FDP) using a new antibody-coated latex particle is described. The latex particle has been specifically coated with antibody to fragments D and E. The latex agglutination test (Thrombo-Wellcotest) has been compared with the tanned red cell haemagglutination inhibition immunoassay (TRCHII) in 143 patients with a variety of clinical conditions. There is a high degree of agreement between the methods with a coefficient of correlation of 0.83. The method provides a rapid, simple screening test for fibrin degradation products.
