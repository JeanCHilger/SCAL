Role of dextran sulfate in urokinase therapy and evaluation of the effects by estimation of plasmin inhibitor, fibrinogenolytic degradation products, and fibrinolytic degradation products. The present study was concerned with changes in APTT and coagulation-fibrinolytic inhibitors in 2 groups of patients receiving either UK with heparin or UK with heparin and dextran sulfate (DS). APTT just after UK treatment showed a significant prolongation in patients receiving combination treatment with DS, but contrarily a shortening in patients receiving those with DS. This result indicated the usefulness of DS combination in UK treatment. There was a marked difference between the responses of alpha 2-PI and antiplasmin to the treatment, presumably as a result of immune complex formation of the alpha 2-PI with plasmin. However, no marked difference in alpha 2-PI and AT-III existed both just after and at 24 hours after UK treatment in patients receiving UK (240,000 units) with both heparin and DS and those receiving UK (480,000 units) with heparin. Those results suggest that the dosage of UK can be reduced by combination of DS. Successful UK treatment in clinical cases resulted in a decrease of alpha 2-PI and an increase of fibrinogenolytic or fibrinolytic degradation products. For these reasons, effective UK treatment appears to require combination with DS and several treatment days under the condition with a decrease of alpha 2-PI (50%) and fibrinogenolysis with fibrinolysis, which are followed by administrations of UK.
