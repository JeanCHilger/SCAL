Familial thrombophilia due to resistance to activated protein C. Resistance to activated protein C (RAPC) has been described recently as a cause of trombophilia this may justify up to 50% of thromboembolic disease without predisposing cause in patients under 45 years. A 29 years-old male with a previous deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the lower left limb three years earlier, developed a DVT in the right lower limb after a trauma of the knee that required immobilization, was associated to pulmonary thromboembolism diagnosed by gammagraphic methods. The phlebographic study showed femoro-iliaco-caval venous thrombosis. The proband's father and a younger brother had a previous history of thrombotic episodes. The following tests, were performed in the proband and relatives: prothrombin time, aPTT, thrombin time, fibrinogen, (Von Clauss), antithrombin III (chromogenic), protein C and protein S (coagulometry and ELISA), plasminogen (chromogenic) and lupus anticoagulant (ITT, dRVVT, aCL). RAPC was evaluated in two different samples. The proband study was performed under oral anticoagulation treatment (OAT). Control groups were: 21 blood donors and 12 OAT patients. The results showed a decreased response to APC in the proband (ratio 1.5) and relatives: father (1.4), brothers (1.5 and 1.5), while the mother was within the normal range (> or = 2). In normal controls and OAT patients the ratio was over 2. No other abnormalities were detected in the assays performed. It is concluded that RAPC is the cause of this familial trombophilia. RAPC should be included in the evaluation study of trombophilia.
