Phosphorus metabolites of liver from mice infected with Hymenolepis microstoma. 31P NMR in vivo spectra of mouse livers infected with Hymenolepis microstoma for 130 or 265 days showed modifications in phosphorus-containing metabolite ratios when compared to those of normal liver. After 130 days of infection the metabolite ratio of inorganic phosphate (Pi)/beta ATP significantly increased whereas that of phosphocreatine (PCr)/beta ATP significantly decreased. In older, 265 day infections, the increase in Pi/beta ATP and decrease in PCr/beta ATP persisted. Changes in the group infected for 130 days were accompanied by lowered pH. Analysis of liver extracts from mice with 130-day-old. H. microstoma revealed significantly lower concentrations of Pi, ATP and ADP compounds. In those from mice infected for 265 days the concentration of Pi remained low whereas concentrations of ATP and ADP increased to levels in between those of controls and the 130-day-old infection. In addition, levels of phosphorylethanolamine (PE) and of an unknown metabolite significantly increased in this latter group. Worm extracts contained high levels of glycerophosphorylcholine (GPC), Pi, fructose 1,6-diphosphate (FDP), PE, diphosphodiesters (DPDE), phosphorylcholine (PC) and glycerolphosphorylethanolamine (GPE) in order of declining concentrations, respectively.
