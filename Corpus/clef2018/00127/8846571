Detection of malignant tumors using Tc-99m labeled Fab' fragments from a monoclonal antibody with specificity for D-dimer of cross-linked fibrin. The authors present the case studies of two patients whose malignant tumors were detected with a Tc-99m labeled antifibrin monoclonal antibody (DD-3B6/22), which is specific for cross-linked fibrin. The first case was a malignant fibrous histiocytoma involving the proximal aspect of the left thigh, whereas in the second case, the patient was receiving treatment for a squamous cell carcinoma of the right mainstem bronchus. The results highlight the potential of this anti-D-dimer radiopharmaceutical for noninvasive detection of malignant tumors.
