What the neurosurgeon needs to know about the coagulation system. Intracranial surgery is often complicated by thromboembolic events including the life-threatening pulmonary embolism. After head trauma and in patients with brain tumors disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) can occur, characterized by the triggering of the coagulation cascade and the depletion of coagulation factors which ultimately leads to bleeding. The identification of patients at high risk as well as the early diagnosis of hemostatic problems uses routine laboratory parameters such as partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time reflecting the intrinsic and the extrinsic pathway of the coagulation respectively. Thrombin antithrombin III complexes (TAT) and prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F1 + 2) are further indicators of an activation of the coagulation whereas fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) refer to the fibrinolytic system. The basic principles of coagulation and fibrinolysis are summarized as well as the changes of laboratory parameters accompanying DIC, hypercoagulability and hyperfibrinolysis.
