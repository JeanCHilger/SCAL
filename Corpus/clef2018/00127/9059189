Effects of bolus tube feeding on cerebral blood flow velocity in neonates. To study continuously cerebral blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery before, during, and after tube feeding in neonates.Cerebral blood flow velocity was measured in 14 neonates using a Doppler ultrasound device. Blood pressure, respiration, and oxygen saturation were monitored.Mean blood flow velocity decreased from 37 cm/s before feeding to 33 cm/s (P < 0.001) 5 to 11 minutes after feeding. Prefeeding values were reached after 17 minutes. Arterial blood pressure, respiration patterns, and oxygen saturation did not change significantly during the study period.Tube feeding in preterm infants may decrease cerebral perfusion, despite unchanged blood pressure and unchanged oxygen saturation.
