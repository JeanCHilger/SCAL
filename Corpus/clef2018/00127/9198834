Value of plasma D-dimer assays in the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism. The diagnostic usefulness of measuring plasma D-dimers using the ELISA method and the latex agglutination test has been prospectively evaluated in 117 patients hospitalized for suspicion of acute venous thrombo-embolism (AVTE): pulmonary embolism was suspected in 80 patients and the remaining 37 had a suspicion of deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs. The diagnosis of AVTE was confirmed in 50% of the patients, all of whom underwent gold standard invasive investigation i.e. pulmonary angiography and/or contrast venography. The sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and positive predictive value of a D-dimers plasma concentration exceeding 500 ng/ml for the diagnosis of AVTE were respectively 98, 58, 97 and 70% when using the ELISA method, and 86, 71, 84 and 75% when using the latex assay. In 47 patients whose lung scans yielded abnormalities of indeterminate probability of pulmonary embolism, the sensitivity of the ELISA method was very high (94%), but that of latex assay was low (67%). Our results demonstrate that measuring the plasma D-dimers by the latex assay should not be used in the diagnosis of AVTE. On the other hand, the ELISA method might be of great interest in the diagnostic strategy of AVTE, as a normal concentration of D-dimers rules out almost definitely the diagnosis of AVTE, and hence, spares from performing invasive investigations.
