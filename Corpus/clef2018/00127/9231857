Catalytic activity of phospholipase A2 in serum in experimental fat embolism in pigs. To investigate the catalytic activity of phospholipase A2 in serum during the early phase of experimental fat embolism.Randomised controlled experimental study.Animal laboratory, Finland.18 domestic pigs weighing 25-31 kg.Allogeneic bone marrow suspension at a dose of 100 mg/kg was infused intracavally in 9 anaesthetised, mechanically ventilated, and haemodynamically monitored pigs 9 control pigs received saline.Central haemodynamics, blood gases, catalytic activity of phospholipase A2.In the fat embolism group, there were significant increases in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (p < 0.001), pulmonary vascular resistance (p < 0.001) and pulmonary shunting (p < 0.05) and simultaneously, systemic oxygenation was significantly impaired. The animals with fat embolism developed gradual fever and leucocytosis, whereas the catalytic activity of phospholipase A2 remained relatively unchanged.In this experimental model the measurement of serum phospholipase A2 activity does not provide a useful tool for the early detection of experimental fat embolism.
