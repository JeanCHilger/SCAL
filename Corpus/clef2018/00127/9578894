Antibodies against phospholipids and beta 2-glycoprotein I increase the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism in patients without systemic lupus erythematosus. We studied the prognostic significance of antiphospholipid antibodies for recurrence of venous thromboembolism (VTE), in 71 patients admitted for acute VTE (deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) in a single internal medicine unit. Lupus anticoagulant (LA), antibodies directed against beta 2-glycoprotein I (beta 2GPI) and antibodies against both beta 2GPI and a mixture of phospholipids (cardiolipin, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidic acid) (APAs) were measured. The patients were followed-up (mean 4.9 years) to determine the time to the next VTE. We found LA in nine patients, anti-beta 2GPI antibodies in seven patients and APAs in six patients. The cumulative risk of recurring VTE was higher in patients with beta 2GPI-binding antibodies (hazard ratio 12.6, 95% CI 1.5-104.9 p = 0.0029). The risk associated with APAs was 11.5 (95% CI 1.3-98.9
