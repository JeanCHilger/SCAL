Recurrent abortion and moderate or strong antiphospholipid antibody production. To investigate the treatment outcome for women suffering recurrent miscarriages associated with strong or moderate antiphospholipid antibody (aPL) production.Sixty-seven pregnancies in 61 women demonstrating at least one kind of aPL with a history of recurrent miscarriages were treated with: (1) aspirin (ASA) alone (2) prednisolone (PSL) and ASAOut of a total of 16 (50%) patients strongly-positive for aPL and 47 out of 51 (92.2%) moderately-positive demonstrated a successful outcome. The live birth rate moderate group was significantly higher than in the strongly-positive cases (P < 0.0005). In the cases exhibiting moderate aPL production, 28 out of 30 (93.3%) receiving PSL and ASA and 14 out of 15 (93.3%) treated with ASA alone successfully gave birth. None of the 14 given ASA alone suffered preterm delivery or IUGR. In contrast 12 (36.4%) and 6 (18.2%) of the 33 patients treated with the PSL combination therapy suffered from preterm delivery and IUGR, respectively.The live birth rate in patients strongly positive for aPL is lower than that in patients with moderate aPL production even if treatment is performed during pregnancy. However, ASA is useful to treat cases with moderate aPL so that distinction of the two groups is warranted.
