Prenatal echographic diagnosis of esophageal atresia. Apropos ofa case. We reported an antenatal diagnosis case of oesophageal atresia in 21 years aged woman in second pregnancy. The echographic diagnosis of antenatal oesophageal atresia was suspected from the non visualisation of stomach liquid after separate following examinations at 8 days interval, the presence of a great abundant hydramnios and a very important delay of in utero foetal growth. This study permitted us to emphasize the antenatal diagnosis interest in supporting a child with oesophageal atresia during neonatal period. The vital prognosis was essentially conditioned in this context of neonatal emergency by putting a feeding tube (cul-de-sac) and the absolute prohibition of any oral alimentation, waiting for the transfer of the child to a specialized institution.
