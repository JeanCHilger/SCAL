Paragonimiasis: a rare little known disease. Paragonimiasis, caused by a lung fluke, is an parasitic disease rarely encountered in France.A 52-year-old man developed dyspnea, cough, mild fever and chest pain. Pleural effusion suggested possible pulmonary embolism or tuberculosis. Cell counts in blood and pleural effusion fluid revealed major eosinophila in this patient who had recently returned from a trip to Japan. Paragonimiasis was confirmed by ELISA. Treatment with praziquantel led to complete clinical and radiographic recovery.The clinical and radiographic features of paragonimiasis are often similar to tuberculosis with pleuropneumopathy, mild fever and dyspnea. ELISA has now replaced parasitologic diagnosis. Cure is achieved with praziquantel.
