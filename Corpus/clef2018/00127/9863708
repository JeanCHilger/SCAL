Diagnostic value of two rapid and individual D-dimer assays in patients with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism: comparison with microplate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A semiquantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test (Instant IA D-dimer) and a new quantitative rapid and individual test (STA-Liatest DDi) were compared with the reference microplate ELISA (Asserachrom D-Di) for D-dimer testing in 142 patients clinically suspected of pulmonary embolism, on the basis of clinical symptoms and signs, electrocardiogram, blood gases and chest X-Ray abnormalities. The cut-off value for the quantitative tests was 500 ng/ml and Instant IA was interpreted by three readers. Pulmonary embolism was confirmed by lung scan or angiography in 60 patients (42%). The sensitivities of ELISA and STA-Liatest DDi were 92% [95% confidence interval (CI) 82-97%] and 93% (95% CI 84-98%), respectively. The three readings of Instant IA D-dimer disagreed in 27 (19%) of the patients and sensitivity varied from 83 to 93% according to the readers. In the 115 patients with concordant readings, sensitivity was 92% (95% CI 82-98%). These results suggest that STA Liatest DDi may be used instead of microplate ELISA for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism, whereas the use of Instant IA D-dimer for this purpose is limited by the number of discordant results.
