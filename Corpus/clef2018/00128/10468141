Diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. The patient with suspected pulmonary embolism presents a challenging diagnostic problem. The symptoms and signs are nonspecific, and objective testing is required to establish or exclude the presence of pulmonary embolism. Lung scanning continues to be a first-line test, but in 40% to 70% of all patients, the results do not definitively provide indication for either giving or withholding anticoagulant treatment even when combined with the clinical assessment. Pulmonary angiography is the reference standard, but it is invasive and may not be available in all clinical settings. Pulmonary embolism is strongly associated with proximal deep-vein thrombosis of the legs (popliteal, femoral, or iliac vein thrombosis). Objective testing for proximal deep-vein thrombosis is useful in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. A positive result from such testing provides an indication for anticoagulant treatment. Serial testing for proximal deep-vein thrombosis is a safe and effective alternative to pulmonary angiography in patients with adequate cardiorespiratory reserve. The assay for plasma D-dimer using either a rapid enzyme-linked immunospecific assay technique or a bedside whole-blood agglutination technique is promising as a test for excluding venous thromboembolism. A positive result by spiral CT imaging is useful for ruling in a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, but the safety of withholding treatment in patients with negative spiral CT results remains uncertain. Pulmonary angiography continues to have an important role in selected patients in whom it is critical to definitively confirm or exclude the presence of pulmonary embolism.
