Developmental changes in phosphatidylinositol transfer protein concentration and phospholipid transfer activities in rat type II cells. The phospholipid transfer proteins (PLTPs) are cytosolic proteins that have been characterized by their ability to facilitate the transfer of phospholipids between membranes in vitro. The goals of this study were to determine whether PITP alpha concentration and phospholipid transfer activities are enriched in type II cells compared with whole lung and to determine the developmental changes in PITP alpha concentration and phospholipid transfer activities during late gestation and newborn period. The concentration of PITP alpha in type II cell cytosol measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) increased during late fetal gestation to 2.2-fold adult levels and declined 41% during the first postnatal day. However, compared to whole adult lung cytosol, type II cell cytosol was not significantly enriched with PITP alpha. Phospholipid transfer activities were determined by a vesicle-rat lung membrane transfer assay. In adult lung, transfer activities for all the phospholipids were enriched in adult type II cell cytosol compared to whole lung cytosol (phosphatidylglycerol [PG], 12.5-fold phosphatidylinositol [PI], 9.2-fold
