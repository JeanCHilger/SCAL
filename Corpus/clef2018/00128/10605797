Improvements in the diagnostic approach for patients with suspected deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Recent advances in the management of patients with suspected VTE have resulted in improvements in the diagnostic testing accuracy and the development of management algorithms that are safer and more accessible. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating whether these diagnostic management strategies can be made even simpler and less expensive. Diagnostic procedures for VTE continue to be refined, and modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging and spiral CT, have the potential to further increase the accuracy of the investigation approach. There is still need to improve management strategies for the diagnosis of recurrent venous thrombosis and to determine whether diagnostic testing results may be correlated with long-term patient treatment needs.
