D-dimer after delivery in uncomplicated pregnancies. D-dimer is now widely used as a coagulation marker. During pregnancy the D-dimer level increases until term even in uncomplicated pregnancies. The aim of the study was to establish the D-dimer immediately after delivery in uncomplicated pregnancies. A rapid immunoturbidimetric assay for D-dimer determination was employed in 100 consecutive deliveries. D-dimer level increased significantly in all women after delivery (increase from 1 to more than 10 times over the normal range).An increase in fibrinolysis is associated with pregnancy and delivery, and D-dimer level must be interpreted only in association with other clinical, laboratory and instrumental methods when pathological conditions (e.g. pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis or disseminated coagulation) are suspected.
