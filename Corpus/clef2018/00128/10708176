Predictive value of a rapid semiquantitative D-dimer assay in critically ill patients with suspected venous thromboembolic disease. To evaluate the performance of a new, rapid semi-quantitative assay for the detection of circulating D-dimer in whole blood from critically ill patients with suspected venous thromboembolic disease.Prospective, blinded, single-center study.Medical intensive care unit (ICU) of Barnes-Jewish Hospital, St. Louis, MO, a university-affiliated urban teaching hospital.Two hundred thirty-nine adult patients with clinical suspicion of venous thromboembolic disease admitted to a medical ICU.Collection of blood samples within 24 hrs of clinical suspicion of venous thromboembolic disease.The main outcome measures evaluated included the occurrence of venous thromboembolic disease (i.e., lower extremity venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, catheter-associated venous thrombosis) and hospital mortality. Fifty-seven patients (23.8%) were classified as having venous thromboembolic disease during their ICU stays (pulmonary embolism, 21 patients lower extremity thrombosis, 44 patientsThese preliminary findings suggest that a rapid whole-blood assay for the semiquantitative detection of circulating D-dimer may be a useful diagnostic tool for the exclusion of venous thromboembolic disease among critically ill patients.
