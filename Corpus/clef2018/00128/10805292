Increased hemostatic molecular markers in patients undergoing anticoagulant therapy. We evaluated several molecular markers of hemostasis in 92 patients with hypercoagulable states treated with anticoagulant therapy. In all patients, the average values of the international normalized ratio (INR) were 1.70 +/- 0.50 this increase in INR was not, however, significant in patients under thrombotest (TT) monitoring. There were no thrombotic or severe bleeding complications in these patients during a period of 27 months. Plasma levels of thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), plasmin-plasmin inhibitor complex (PPIC), D-dimer, and soluble fibrin monomer (sFM) were slightly increased, suggesting that anticoagulant therapy was not completely effective in our Japanese patients based on the values of the TT. The INR was negatively correlated with TT, protein C, and protein S and particularly with TT between 10 and 80%. The range of TT was not correlated with the plasma level of TAT, PPIC, D-dimer, or sFM, but the range of INR was correlated with the plasma level of TAT, D-dimer, and sFM. The percentage of TAT, D-dimer, and sFM within normal range was significantly lower in patients with high INR. These findings show that INR is better than TT for the monitoring of warfarin therapy and that the therapeutic values of INR during the anticoagulant therapy should be > 1.7 in Japanese patients.
