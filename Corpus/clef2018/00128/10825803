Pathogenesis of pulmonary thrombosis in Duchenne muscular dystrophy a consideration from changes in serum CK and LDH levels. We assessed the hypercoagulative state in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) by measuring peripheral blood creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. In 76 patients with DMD who had no complications during examination, the CK and LDH levels were examined in a total of 173 times. Both enzyme levels were elevated and highly correlated (R = 0.93). We examined the temporal alteration of serum CK and LDH levels during episodes of pulmonary thrombosis experienced in 7 DMD patients who fulfilled the following diagnostic criteria: 1. sudden onset of dyspnea, chest pain, and hypoxia 2. abnormal coagulation profile or abnormal chest CT findings, such as peripheral wedged shaped shadow and
