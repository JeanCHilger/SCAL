The use of thrombus precursor protein, D-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1.2, and thrombin antithrombin in the exclusion of proximal deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. We examined various nonSTAT commercially available coagulation activation markers in an attempt to help diagnose or exclude the often subtle clinical presentations of proximal deep vein thrombosis (PDVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Fifty-five patients presenting to the Emergency Department were completely assessed. Eleven patients were diagnosed with PDVT, six patients were diagnosed with PE, and three patients were diagnosed with both PDVT and PE. Thrombus precursor protein (TpP) excluded the diagnosis in 19 of the 35 patients negative for PDVT and/or PE, D-Dimer in 15 patients, prothrombin fragment 1.2 in 17 patients, and thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) in 14 patients. Both the TpP and TAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests had 100% sensitivity and negative predictive value for evaluating PDVT and/or PE. The TpP ELISA had the highest specificity (54%) of all four markers studied.
