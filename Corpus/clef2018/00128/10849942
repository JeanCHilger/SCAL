Serum levels of progesterone in patients with preeclampsia. In a matched pair-study study we investigated the hitherto controversially discussed serum levels of progesterone in 40 women with severe preeclampsia (PE) and 40 normotensive controls. Serum levels were determined by applying a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Median serum levels of progesterone in preeclamptic women and in controls were not statistically significant (P = 0.73). Our study indicates that the absence of altered serum levels of progesterone may not reflect the potential role of this hormone in preeclampsia.
