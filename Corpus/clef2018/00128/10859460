Pulmonary embolism in the elderly: clinical, instrumental and laboratory aspects. To focus on diagnostic and therapeutic problems of pulmonary embolism in the elderly.Retrospective analysis of 5 years of clinical, instrumental, and laboratory data (collected at the time of hospital admission) for patients 65 years and older with pulmonary embolism proven by a high-probability scintigraphic lung scan or necropsy. Sixty-eight patients, 46 females and 22 males, 78.61 +/- (SD) 7.71 years old, were enrolled in the study.Dyspnea, chest pain, tachycardia, and tachypnea were the most common symptoms and signs they were present alone or in combination in all patients. Bed rest over 4 days was found in 65% of the patients and deep vein thrombosis in the leg in 35%. Only 7 patients were on anticoagulant therapy which was likely to reduce the incidence of pulmonary embolism. The mortality was 29.5%. Major bleeding due to anticoagulant therapy was observed in 4.4% of the patientsPulmonary embolism is often underdiagnosed in the elderly. Clinical, instrumental, and laboratory findings are nonspecific. Only acute suspicion can increase the number of diagnoses, reduce the time to diagnosis, and improve the prognosis.
