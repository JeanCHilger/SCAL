Clinical evaluation of a monoclonal antibody-based enzyme immunoassay for fibrin degradation products in patients with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism. ANTELOPE-Study Group. We prospectively evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the Fibrinostika FbDP assay in 304 consecutive patients with suspected pulmonary embolism and examined potentially useful cut-off points at which the disease can be excluded. The prevalence of pulmonary embolism was 31%. The assay generated an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve of 0.79 (95% CI 0.73-0.84). A cut-off point of 0.05 microg/ml yielded a sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and an exclusion efficiency of 100% (95% CI 96-100), 5% (95% CI 2-9), 100% (95% CI 69-100) and 3% (95% CI 2-6), respectively. A clinically useful cut-off point seems to be 0.11 microg/ml which corresponded with a sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and an exclusion efficiency of 96% (95% CI 90-99), 27% (95% CI 24-28), 93% (95% CI 84-98) and 20% (95% CI 16-25), respectively. We conclude that the assay has potential clinical utility for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism, but it cannot be used as a sole test.
