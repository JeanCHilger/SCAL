Fibrinolytic system after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are the most important causes of morbility and mortality in patients submitted to surgical intervention: some peculiar factors of laparoscopic surgery can modify their risk. The aim of this study is to evaluate possible variations of the fibrinolytic system after cholecystectomy.Eighteen patients affected by symptomatic and non-complicated gallstones have been included in this study. They were divided into two groups of nine patients each: the first group was submitted to laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) and the second to open cholecystectomy (OC). Antitrombin III (ATIII), fibrinogen degradation products (FDP), tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) have been evaluated preoperatively and 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours after the operation.The levels of ATIII did not present significantly variations. The FDP in both groups were significantly increased 48 hours after open cholecystectomy. Levels of PAI instead were increased in comparison to the basal values at 6, 12, 24, 48 hours with p < 0.05 p < 0.01 and p < 0.05 respectively in patients submitted to OC, in the LC group no variations were observedThe early mobilization of patients in the postoperative course and the lower invasion of LC can oppose the prothrombotic effect in the lower limbs.
