A recombinant chimera composed of repeat region RR1 of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae adhesin with Pseudomonas exotoxin: in vivo evaluation of specific IgG response in mice and pigs. Using the binding and translocation domain of Pseudomonas exotoxin A [domain III deleted PE termed PE(DeltaIII)] as a vehicle, this study characterized and evaluated a novel application of PE toxin in Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae adhesin used as an immunogen. PCR and sequence analysis revealed that 16 copies of AAKPV(E) in tandem repeat region 1 (RR1) of M. hyopneumoniae 97kDa adhesion were successfully fused to the downstream of PE(DeltaIII) to create a subunit vaccine, i.e. PE(DeltaIII)-RR1. This chimeric protein, over-expressed in inclusion bodies of E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS, was characterized by a monoclonal antibody (MAb) F2G5 prepared against RR1 of the 97kDa adhesin and was readily purified. The data indicated that the epitope recognized by MAb F2G5 was located in the structure of PE(DeltaIII)-RR1. Using ELISA and Western blot analyses, the specific IgG immune response against RR1 and whole adhesin in mice immunized with PE(DeltaIII)-RR1 was found more marked than that in mice immunized with the M. hyopneumoniae whole cells. Similarly, PE(DeltaIII)-RR1 also stimulated a remarkable IgG response against RR1 in pigs compared to that in pigs immunized with the conventional M. hyopneumoniae vaccine. The PE(DeltaIII)-RR1 would be potentially useful for the future development of a M. hyopneumoniae adhesin vaccine.
