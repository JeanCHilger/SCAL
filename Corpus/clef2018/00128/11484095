Fibrin monomer could be a useful predictor of pulmonary embolism after total hip arthroplasty: preliminary report. We examined 17 total hip arthroplasty patients in order to develop a method for the predictive diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) after joint arthroplasty. Scintigraphy revealed the presence of PE in 4 patients. Prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), antithrombin III (ATIII), and thrombin-AT III complex (TAT) did not show significant differences between patients with and without PE. D-dimer 7 days after surgery showed significant differences between patients with and without PE. Fibrin monomer (FM) increased sharply after surgery, and it was significantly different between the patients with and without PE immediately after surgery and 2 days after surgery. Our findings suggest the importance of FM in the predictive diagnosis of pulmonary embolism after total hip arthroplasty, and 40 microg/ml or higher levels with our measurement method could represent a high-risk condition.
