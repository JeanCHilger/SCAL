Measurement of the serum concentrations of tumor necrosis factor alpha and its soluble receptors in normal and pre-eclamptic pregnant patients. A multicenter prospective clinical study was designed with the purpose of measure tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and tumor necrosis factor alpha-receptors p55 and p75 (sTNF alpha-p55 and sTNF alpha-p75) in normal pregnancy and preeclampsia (PE). Blood samples were collected without anticoagulant from 30 pregnant women, matched for chronological and gestational age, 15 healthy pregnant (group A) and 15 women with PE (group B). TNF alpha was measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and sTNF alpha-p55 and sTNF alpha-p75 were measured by amplified immunoenzymometric assay. The statistical analysis was carried out using the paired t Student test. The values of TNF alpha were 7.07 +/- 1.63 pg/mL (mean +/- SE) in group A and 16.43 +/- 2.92 in group B pg/mL (p < 0.05).) concentrations of sTNF alpha-p55 were 2.69 +/- 0.17 ng/mL and 5.18 +/- 0.54 ng/mL in groups A and B respectively (p < 0.001)
