Correlation of synovial fluid cytokine levels with histological and clinical parameters of primary and revision total hip and total knee replacements. We retrieved synovial tissue and fluid samples from patients undergoing primary total hip replacement (THR) (n 15), revision of aseptically loose THR (n 12), primary total knee replacement (TKR) (n 13) and revision of aseptically loose TKR (n 6). Several histological parameters were assessed on a relative scale of 14. Primary TJRs were clinically evaluated for degree of osteoarthrosis. Revision TJRs were assessed for migration of the implant, gross loosening and the degree of radiolucency. Cytokine levels in synovial fluid were determined with ELISA. All cytokines were significantly higher in revision TJRs than in primary replacements, as were the degree of macrophage and giant cell infiltration. We found no relationship between any clinical variable and the levels of any cytokine, but migration of the implant was related to the presence of PE debris. A significant correlation was seen between the presence of macrophages and the levels of IL-1beta, IL-8 and IL-10, but not IL-6. No differences were noted between hips and knees for any of the variables, except in the levels of IL-6, where higher levels were found in THRs. These results suggest a unique role for IL-6 that requires further investigation.
