Haemostatic molecular markers in patients undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy for prostate cancer and submitted to prophylaxis with unfractioned or low molecular weight heparin. Deep vein thrombosis and subsequently pulmonary embolism are the most common causes of increased post-operative morbidity and mortality in patients with pelvic or abdominal cancer. Aim of the study was to evaluate variations in coagulative parameters induced by two accepted primary prophylaxis patterns: standardized low doses of unfractioned heparin (UFH) or single doses of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in cancer patients submitted to radical retropubic prostatectomy.Fifty patients (45-75 yr) were randomly assigned two groups. Group 1 received UFH (5000 units s.c. x 3 daily) group 2 received calcium nadroparin (single daily dose of 0.3 ml s.c.). In both groups prophylaxis began preoperatively and was maintained throughout the entire hospital-stay. Blood cell, platelet count, coagulative system exploring tests, thrombotic molecular markers, and physiological inhibitors of coagulation were determined at baseline conditions and on the first and seventh day after surgery.Preoperative values of fibrinogen, F1+2 fragment, TAT and D-dimer resulted over normal range in both groups. A significant increase of these markers was observed also during the post-operative period. PT, aPTT, ATIII, PC, total and free PS showed the most substantial changes on the 1st post operative day, though their values ranged within normal levels on the three sampling times. The levels of haemostatic markers demonstrated a baseline hypercoagulability, probably related to cancer and thrombin activation caused by prostatectomy. Despite this thrombophylic state, neither of the two groups presented symptomatic bleeding or thromboembolic complications.These results prove that a single daily dose of nadroparin has been safe and efficient as a thrice-daily dose of UFH, with a better risk/benefit relationship.
