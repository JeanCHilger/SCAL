PNU-145156E, a novel angiogenesis inhibitor, in patients with solid tumors: a phase I and pharmacokinetic study. Our aim was to establish, in patients with solid tumors, the dose-limiting toxicity, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and pharmacology of PNU-145156E, a new sulfonated distamycin A derivative that blocked circulating angiogenesis-promoting growth factors in animal studies and exhibited an antitumor effect in murine solid tumors. In a Phase I study, PNU-145156E was administered i.v. every 6 weeks. Included were patients with solid tumors an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score </=1
