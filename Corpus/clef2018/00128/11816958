Significance of serum antibody to GD1b ganglioside in patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome. The precise etiological factors in Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) are still unknown. However, humoral and cellular immune factors may have a role in the pathogenesis of GBS. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the clinical significance of circulating serum IgG antibody to GD1b ganglioside in patients with GBS.Serial samples of serum were collected from 18 patients with GBS undergoing plasma exchange (PE) during their hospital stay. Serum IgG antibody titers to GD1b, before, during as well as following PE were measured by an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).In 10 of 18 patients with GBS the antibody to GD1b was present in high titers (1:640-1:5120) prior to PE and the antibody titers in these 10 patients decreased following PE. At the time of completion of the study, the anti GD1b antibody titers declined in relation to clinical recovery in 7 of 10 patients with GBS.The findings of the present study show that antibody to GD1b gangliosides may be one of the immunological factors in the pathogenesis of GBS and PE decreases the anti GD1b antibody titers in these patients.
