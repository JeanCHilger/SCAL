Plasma exchange and continuous hemodiafiltration as an initial treatment for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma-associated hemophagocytic syndrome. A 68-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of fever, jaundice and hepatosplenomegaly. A diagnosis of diffuse large cell, B-cell type malignant lymphoma, associated with hemophagocytic syndrome (LAHS), was made. CT scan revealed lymphadenopathy in the abdominal cavity and multiple tumors in the spleen. Performance status and hepatic coma grade were 4 and II, respectively. Laboratory findings showed bicytopenia (Hb 9.9 g/dl, platelet 35 x 10(3)/microliter), severe liver dysfunction (ALP 1,115 U/l, gamma-GTP 437 U/l, T.Bil 15.4 mg/dl, D.Bil 12.8 mg/dl) and elevated levels of beta 2 microglobulin (12.9 mg/dl), ferritin (2,300 ng/ml) and sIL-2 receptor (36,900 U/ml). Plasma exchange (PE) and continuous hemodiafiltration (CHDF) enabled the patient to undergo diagnostic procedures, irradiation (total 34 Gy) and chemotherapy. Biopsy specimens revealed infiltration of lymphoma cells into the liver and bone marrow. We measured the blood concentrations of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-8 before and after PE and CHDF by the ELISA method, and found normalization of hypercytokinemia after the procedure. It was suggested that initial treatment with PE and CHDF was effective for control of HPS, enabling us to perform chemotherapy for the lymphoma.
