Plasma brain natriuretic peptide as a noninvasive marker for efficacy of pulmonary thromboendarterectomy. Plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), a cardiac hormone secreted mainly by the cardiac ventricles, has been shown to increase in proportion to the degree of cardiac overload. However, whether plasma BNP may serve as a marker for the efficacy of pulmonary thromboendarterectomy in patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension remains unknown.Plasma BNP level was measured in 34 patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension before and 1 month after pulmonary thromboendarterectomy. Right heart catheterization was also performed before and 1 month after the operation.Preoperative plasma BNP level was significantly elevated in patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension compared with control patients (246 +/- 40 vs 13 +/- 2 pg/mL p < 0.001Plasma BNP level was strongly associated with the severity of pulmonary hypertension in patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and thereby may serve as a noninvasive marker for the efficacy of pulmonary thromboendarterectomy.
