Pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common problem for which prompt diagnosis and treatment is essential to minimize mortality. The clinical presentation is more variable than sudden dyspnea and chest pain, especially in the critical care patient. Recognition of venous thromboembolic (VTE) risk factors can help develop a good clinical suspicion for PE. A wide range of diagnostic tests are available to the clinician. The ventilation/perfusion scan, pulmonary arteriogram, and lower extremity investigations are still important for diagnosis. Other noninvasive tests such as spiral CT with venography, echocardiography, and D-dimers are becoming more accepted. Heparin is the mainstay of PE therapy, but thrombolytic treatment may be lifesaving in the unstable patient. VTE prophylaxis should be considered in all post-operative or critical care patients.
