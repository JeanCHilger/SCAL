The pathology of and the cardio-pulmonary functional changes in acute multiple pulmonary microthromboembolism in a canine model. To evaluate the effect of acute multiple pulmonary microthromboembolism on circulation, ventilation, lung histology, and the coagulatory and fibrinolytic functions.Thirteen dogs were studied, 7 in the embolism group and 6 in the control group. 10 ml of blood was withdrawn from each animal. Thrombi were formed and cut into pieces of 1 mm to 2 mm in size. The thrombi were counted, and 300 thrombi were infused at one time back to the same animal. PAP, PAWP, VO(2), DO(2), D-dimer, protein C, protein S were measured before and immediately, 30 min, 1 hour, 2 hour after embolism.PAP was increased immediately after embolisation, and then decreased at 1 hour. The level of D-dimer was elevated at an early stage. Pulmonary hemorrhage, consolidation and microembolism were observed.Multiple microthromboembolism caused lung injury and thrombosis. PAP was increased at the early stage, but ventilation was not affected. The level of D-dimer changed at the early stage of thromboembolism.
