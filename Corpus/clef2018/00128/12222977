Advances in diagnosing and excluding pulmonary embolism: spiral CT and D-dimer measurement. No single imaging study or blood test is 100% sensitive and specific for pulmonary embolism. A combination of pretest clinical probability assessment, noninvasive pulmonary imaging (V/Q scanning or spiral CT), and D-dimer testing seems prudent before pursuing pulmonary angiography.
