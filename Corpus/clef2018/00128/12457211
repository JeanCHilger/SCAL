Modifications of coagulation and fibrinolytic parameters in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The incidence of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism following laparoscopic surgery is unknown and studies on alterations of hemostasis after laparoscopy are inconclusive.In this study we prospectively evaluated changes in prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen (Fg), antithrombin III (ATIII), prothrombin fragment F 1 + 2, beta-thromboglobulin (betaTG) and D-dimer (D-D), preoperatively and 24 h after laparoscopic surgery in 16 patients.Comparing pre- and postoperative values, no statistical differences were observed in aPTT, F1 + 2, and ATIII measurements. Postoperative PT values increased slightly (p approximately 0.05) after surgery. Conversely, Fg, betaTG, and D-D values were statistically higher in the 24-h evaluation (p = 0.008, 0.01, and 0.045, respectively).These data suggest that laparoscopic surgery induces activation of coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways and, additionaly, betaTG elevation, which has never been reported and might account for postoperative platelet activation and a greater risk of thrombogenicity. Therefore, routine thromboembolic prophylaxis in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery is recommended.
