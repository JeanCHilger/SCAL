Similar binding to glutamate receptors by Rasmussen and partial epilepsy patients' sera. Immunoreactivity of sera from patients with Rasmussen encephalitis (RE) and patients with partial epilepsy (PE) was analyzed by immunohistoblot on rat brain sections and the staining pattern compared with that obtained with antibodies to a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid and NMDA receptors. Staining for anti-glutamate receptor 3 (GluR3) was found in 82% of patients with RE and 64% of patients with PE. Histoblot analysis showed a positive staining in GluR3- and NMDA-specific regions of rat brain, providing a comprehensive CNS immunolocalization.
