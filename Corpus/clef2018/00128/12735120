Diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary embolism in the elderly. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a difficult diagnosis in patients of all ages, but more so in the elderly. Nonspecific symptoms and laboratory results are often misattributed to common diseases or to age itself, and can delay or even deter the diagnosis and treatment of PE. Advanced age is sometimes mistakenly seen as a contraindication to anticoagulation and thrombolysis. Together, these factors contribute to the higher morbidity and mortality associated with PE in the elderly than in younger patients. This article reviews the risk factors, diagnosis, and treatment of PE as it applies to the elderly.
