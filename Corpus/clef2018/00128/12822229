Acute pulmonary embolism emergency. Confirming diagnosis, administering heparin, begin thrombolysis. In suspected acute pulmonary embolism, the measurement of the d-dimer is now an established screening method. Further diagnostic measures include the electrocardiogram, echocardiography and conventional chest radiography, as well as the analysis of blood gases. The specific demonstration of a pulmonary embolism is achieved with a helical CT of the thorax, pulmonary angiography and ventilation/perfusion scanning. Apart from continuous (infusion) of unfractionated heparin, the low molecular weight heparins also are of potential value in the treatment of pulmonary embolism. A larger percentage of patients benefit from the use of fibrinolytic agents than was previously thought, so that the indication for fibrinolytic therapy should not be made dependent on the presence of hemodynamic instability.
