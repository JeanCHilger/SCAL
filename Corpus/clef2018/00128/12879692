Therapy and prevention of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in gynecology and obstetrics. The aim of this paper is to present the latest developments in therapy and prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis in gynecology and obstetrics.The data presented in the paper have been extracted from the Current Contents database. In the introduction, the coagulation cascade is described, and certain coagulation abnormalities caused by deficiency or decreased activity of coagulation factors are highlighted. The most prominent signs of deep vein thrombosis in pregnant women are swelling and tenderness of the affected leg, sometimes accompanied with fever and leucocytosis. In pelvic thrombosis, swelling of the leg is often absent and such a condition may be mistaken for other abdominal emergencies. The diagnostic algorithm for deep vein thrombosis starts with the clinical Wells criteria. To confirm the diagnosis it is necessary to visualize the thrombus by one of the imaging methods. The value of D-dimer is limited by its low positive predictive value, particularly in pregnant women. Low weight molecular heparin's have lately almost replaced standard heparin in the treatment of the deep vein thrombosis in pregnant women for providing advantages of subcutaneous application, no need of laboratory control of coagulation parameters, lower risk of bleeding, and lower incidence of osteoporosis and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. We list the recommendations of the American College of Chest Physicians published in 1991, which stratify pregnant women with deep vein thrombosis according to their medical history and laboratory parameters. We have specified the proposed approach according to: history of deep vein thrombosis due to transient risk factors previous idiopathic deep vein thrombosis without anticoagulant therapy
