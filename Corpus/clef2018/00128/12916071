Influence of ethyl acetate extract and quercetin-3-methyl ether from Polygonum amphibium on activation lymphocytes from peripheral blood of healthy donor in vitro. The influence of an ethyl acetate extract from Polygonum amphibium L. and quercetin-3-methyl ether isolated from them were examined on the human immune system. The investigations were made on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors. The cells were stimulated by plant extract and quercetin-3-methyl ether in 24 h culture and analysed inflow cytometry. The following mice monoclonal antibody anti human activate markers were used: anti HLA-DR PE, anti CD25 FITC, anti CD69 FITC and anti CD71 FITC. The level of Interleukine-2 in blood serum and in culture supernatants was measured by ELISA method. Ethyl acetate extract from Polygonum amphibium caused the rise in the number of CD25 and HLA-DR positive lymphocytes and increased the expression of CD25 and CD71 antigens. The level of IL-2 was increasing for the duration of the culture, independently from the presence of stimulators. Besides quercetin-3-methyl ether, from herb of Polygonum amphibium L., trans-taxifolin, quercetin and kaempferol were isolated The structure of the isolated compounds was determined by spectroscopic (UV, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and CI-MS) methods.
