Micelles from polyethylene glycol/phosphatidylethanolamine conjugates for tumor drug delivery. Micelles prepared from polyethylene glycols of various lengths conjugated with phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-PE) were loaded with various poorly soluble anticancer agents. PEG-PE micelles selectively accumulated in Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) tumors implanted in mice. Modification of the micelles with tumor specific antibodies further enhanced the efficiency of tumor accumulation.
