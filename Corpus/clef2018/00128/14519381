Plasma levels of endothelin-1, big endothelin-1 and thromboxane following acute pulmonary air embolism. Acute pulmonary air embolism (APAE) was induced in nine piglets by repeated intravenous bolus injection of room air into a large bore central venous catheter at time=0 min so that the mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) was maintained at two times the baseline value for 4 h. Another five animals served as controls. At time=0, 30, 60, 120, 240 min, circulating arterial plasma levels of endothelin-1 (ET-1), its precursor big ET-1, and thromboxane (Tx), were measured by RIA and EIA, respectively, along with hemodynamics and blood gases. The data showed that following APAE, there was a rapid increase in MPAP and a persistent decrease in Pa(O(2)), while the mean arterial blood pressure and cardiac output remained comparable. Plasma levels of ET-1, big ET-1 and Tx were also increased steadily in these first 4 h. These results showed that during APAE, the resulted changes in the pulmonary vascular and airway tones mediated by these potent mediators could explain the observed pulmonary hypertension and the deterioration of gas exchange.
