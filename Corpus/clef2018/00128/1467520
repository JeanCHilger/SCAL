Activation of human platelets by the rabbit anticardiolipin antibodies. Affinity purified anticardiolipin antibodies (ACLA) raised in rabbits showed cross-reactivities with various negatively charged phospholipids as shown by both the solid phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and inhibition studies. In ELISA, ACLA showed strong cross-reactivity to both sphingomyelin (SM) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), but the inhibition studies showed that ACLA failed to bind the aqueous suspensions of SM, PE, and PE/PC (1:1). ACLA bound to resting gel-filtered human platelets (GFP) as shown by both inhibition study and flow cytofluorometric analysis. Western blotting procedure showed that ACLA strongly cross-reacted to an 80-Kd plasma membrane protein. ACLA activated platelet response in a concentration-dependent manner. At less than 10 micrograms/mL, ACLA induced both platelet shape change to spiculate irregular forms as shown by scanning electron microscopy and the phosphorylation of 20-Kd protein. ACLA at more than 10 micrograms/mL caused platelet aggregation and secretion. The aggregation was inhibited by EDTA aspirin
