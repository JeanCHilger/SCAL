Volumetric capnography as a screening test for pulmonary embolism in the emergency department. To compare the diagnostic performance of volumetric capnography (VCap), which is the plot of the expired CO(2) partial pressure against the expired volume during a single breath, with the PaCO(2) to end-tidal CO(2) (EtCO(2)) gradient, in the case of suspected pulmonary embolism (PE).Single-center, prospective study.Emergency department of a teaching hospital.A total of 45 outpatients with positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay d-dimer levels of > 500 ng/mL. The diagnosis of PE was confirmed in 18 outpatients according to a validated procedure based on the ventilation-perfusion lung scan and/or spiral CT scanning.Curves of VCap were obtained from a compact monitor connected to a computer. A sequence of four to six stable breaths allowed the calculation of the following several variables: alveolar dead space fraction the ratio of alveolar dead space (VDalv) to airway dead space (VDaw)The mean (+/- SD) PaCO(2)-EtCO(2) gradient was 5.3 +/- 0.7 mm Hg in the PE-positive group and 2.8 +/- 0.7 mm Hg in the PE-negative group (p = 0.019). Four variables of the VCap exhibited a statistical difference between both groups, as follows: the VDalv/VDaw fraction() the slope of phase 3Fdlate, a variable of VCap, had a statistically better diagnostic performance in suspected PE than the PaCO(2)-EtCO(2) gradient. VCap is a promising computer-assisted bedside application of pulmonary pathophysiology. Future research should define the place of this technique in the diagnostic workup of PE, especially in the presence of positive d-dimers.
