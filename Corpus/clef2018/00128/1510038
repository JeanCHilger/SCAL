Evaluation of serum immunoglobulins by protein electrophoresis and rate nephelometry before and after therapeutic plasma exchange. One hundred fourteen pre- and postplasma exchange (PE) serum protein electrophoretograms and serum IgG, IgA, and IgM levels obtained during a 4-month period from 23 patients were evaluated. The interval between PE sessions varied from once daily to approximately once monthly. Typically, post-PE patterns had decreased alpha-1, decreased alpha-2, decreased beta, and decreased gamma fractions. The average percentage decreases of the immunoglobulins subsequent to PE were as follows: IgG, 52% IgA, 55%
