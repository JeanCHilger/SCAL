The prevalence of vascular occlusive disease associated with antiphospholipid syndromes. The association of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) with unexplained vascular occlusive disease (VOD) is well known. We reviewed the records of 102 consecutive patients seen over a 9 months period who had positive IgG or IgM aCL to determine the frequency and types of VOD in this unselected group of patients. Lupus anticoagulant was detectable in 17 of 67 (25%) patients tested. VOD occurred in 80 of 102 (78%) aCL-positive patients comprised of 17 (16.7%) with systemic venous VOD or pulmonary embolism 27 (26.5%) with cerebral VOD: 11 (10.8%) with systemic arterial VOD
