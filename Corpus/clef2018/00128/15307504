D-dimer in the early detection of deep vein thrombosis in the lower extremity. Deep vein thrombosis is important social and health care problem for its high incidence, pulmonary embolism-related mortality, and long-term sequelae which may be disabling (post-thrombotic syndrome and ulceration). The aim of our work was to determine the diagnostic potential and importance of D dimer in the early detection of deep vein thrombosis of lower extremities. Prospectively we have analyzed a group of 47 patients who were admitted to vascular department of Surgical Clinic in Nis during the period from 1.8.2001. to 31.3.2003. with echosonographically verified deep vein thrombosis of no more than 48 hours of duration. D dimer was measured before anticoagulant treatment started using commercial Nycomed test. The activation of coagulation process was detected with increase in D dimer values in 44 out of 47 examined patients (93.61%). D dimer is highly sensitive diagnostic tool that should be routinely used in the patients with suspected deep vein thrombosis of leg.
