Further development of 32P-postlabeling for the detection of alkylphosphotriesters: evidence for the long-term nonrandom persistence of ethyl-phosphotriester adducts in vivo. DNA phosphate oxygens are sites for alkylation leading to phosphotriester adducts (PTEs). PTEs are reported to be both abundant and persistent and so may serve as long-term markers of genotoxicity. Previously, we reported a 32P-postlabeling assay for the specific detection of PTEs plus identification of nucleosides located 5' to PTEs. Using this, we demonstrated the nonrandom nature of ethyl-PTEs (Et-PTEs) in vivo, these results being suggestive of either the nonrandom formation of Et-PTEs in vivo or sequence specific Et-PTE repair. Presently, we report the further development and validation of the 32P-postlabeling assay, to permit the more straightforward determination of nucleosides 5' to PTEs and, using this, have investigated the long-term persistence of PTEs in vivo. Analysis of liver DNA of mice treated in vivo with N-nitrosodiethylamine reveals an initial decline in the level of Et-PTEs (t1/2<24 h) as well as their nonrandom persistence for the duration of the time course, with approximately 37 and approximately 15% of the initial Et-PTEs remaining 4 and 56 days after treatment, respectively. From this, we conclude that Et-PTEs are suitable as long-term markers of genotoxic exposure and that putative PTE repair is not responsible for their nonrandom manifestation. However, the possibility of active repair contributing to the initial decline of Et-PTEs is considered.
