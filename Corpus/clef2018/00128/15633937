Pulmonary embolism, prolonged diagnosis in young man. Despite progress in early detection and treatment, the rates of mortality and recurrences of pulmonary embolism remain high. Cardiovascular specialists must keep pulmonary embolism in mind when they evaluate patients with unexplained substernal or pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea and syncope because these symptoms constitute the cardinal clinical presentation of pulmonary embolism.
