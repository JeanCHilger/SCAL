Changes of the platelet function and serum anticardiolipin antibody in patients with pulmonary thromboembolism. To explore the changes of the platelet function and serum anticardiolipin antibody (ACA) in patients with pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE).Forty-eight patients with PTE diagnosed by spiral computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) were included as the trial group, while 20 person in which PTE was excluded served as the control group. P-selectin, and GPIIb/IIIa expressed on platelets were measured by flow cytometry, and plasma TXB(2), 6-Keto-PGF1alpha, vWF, D-dimer and serum ACA were measured by ELISA and the changes of these parameters were compared 1 week later.In the trial group, the levels of P-selectin, GPIIb/IIIa, TXB(2), vWF, D-dimer and T/K were significantly higher than those in the control group (P < 0.01). But the plasma level of 6-Keto-PGF1alpha in the patients with PTE was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.01). The levels of ACA-IgG and ACA-IgA were significantly higher than those in the control group (P < 0.01). After therapy the level of 6-Keto-PGF1alpha was significantly higher than that before therapy (P < 0.01), and other parameters were significantly lower than those before therapy (P < 0.01). P-selectin, GPIIb/IIIa and vWF were positively correlated with D-dimer (P < 0.01).Endothelium damage, platelet activation and hypercoagulation combined with fibrinolytic activation occur in patients with PTE.
