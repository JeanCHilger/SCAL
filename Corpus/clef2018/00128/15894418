Increased levels of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in preeclampsia. MIF is a proinflammatory cytokine involved in reproduction. Systemic activation of maternal inflammatory cell responses may play an important role in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia (PE). We hypothesized that MIF could be involved in preeclampsia.Concentration of immunoreactive MIF was assayed by enzyme-linked immunoassorbent assay (ELISA) in maternal serum samples obtained from 41 term control pregnancies and 21 severe preeclamptic pregnancies (14 delivered before and 7 at or after 34 weeks).MIF serum levels were significantly higher in preeclamptic pregnancies (median 12.74 ng/ml) than in control group (median 5.3n g/ml) p = 0.001. MIF concentration was significantly higher when delivery occurred <34 weeks (median 17.80 ng/ml range 2.80-80.20) than in the group delivered > or = 34 weeks (median 6.16 ng/mlHigh maternal serum levels MIF in pregnancies complicated by severe preeclampsia strongly support the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of this disease.
