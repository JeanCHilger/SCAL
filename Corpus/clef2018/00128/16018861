Prognostic significance of troponin elevation and right ventricular enlargement in acute pulmonary embolism. The troponin I values and echocardiographic data of 141 patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) were correlated with 30-day mortality. Patients with elevated troponin and right ventricular enlargement are at significantly greater risk for death after PE than patients with only 1 or with neither adverse prognostic marker.
