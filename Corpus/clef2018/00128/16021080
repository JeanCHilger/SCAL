Low plasma HLA-G protein concentrations in early gestation indicate the development of preeclampsia later in pregnancy. The aim of this study was to determine whether circulating HLA-G levels, early in pregnancy, predict the subsequent development of preeclampsia (PE).Plasma samples, collected longitudinally during the first, second, and third trimesters, from 12 PE patients and 12 matched control patients were tested for HLA-G protein using a validated sandwich ELISA.First and second trimester HLA-G levels in PE were significantly lower than in control patients (first trimester, 1.25 microg/mL vs 1.95 microg/mL, P=.029 second trimester, 1.11 microg/mL vs 1.90 microg/mL, P=.024).Our results indicate that HLA-G levels in plasma from women who subsequently develop PE are lower than control patients, as early as the first trimester. This suggests that determination of circulating HLA-G protein concentration may be useful as an early predictor for the development of PE.
