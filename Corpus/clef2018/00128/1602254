Significance of the determination of D-dimers in venous thrombo-embolic disease. Plasma measurement of D-dimers (DD) with the Elisa technique is very useful in the diagnostic approach of venous thromboembolic diseases: a low level of plasma D-dimers (500 micrograms/l when using the Elisa from Stago) allows to exclude the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism with predictive values of 94% and 98%, respectively. Such a diagnostic potential is particularly useful in the group of patients with inconclusive perfusion-ventilation scintigraphy (low or indeterminate probability of pulmonary embolism) which represent more than 50% of the patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. Presence of pulmonary embolism is suggested by levels above 4.000 micrograms/l in the collective of outpatients who are urgently referred because of clinical suspicion of embolism.
