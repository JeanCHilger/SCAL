Management of suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) by D-dimer and multi-slice computed tomography in outpatients: an outcome study. A prospective outcome study designed to evaluate a simple strategy for the management of outpatients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE), based on clinical probability, D-dimer, and multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT).A cohort of 432 consecutive patients admitted to the emergency department with suspected PE was managed by sequential non-invasive testing. Patients in whom PE was ruled out were not given anticoagulants, but were followed-up for 3 months.Normal D-dimer and low-intermediate clinical probability ruled out PE in 103 patients [24% (95% CI 20-28)]. Seventeen patients had normal D-dimer, but high clinical probability and proceeded to MSCT. All patients proved negative for PE. A total of 329 (76%) patients underwent MSCT examination. Pulmonary embolism was diagnosed in 93 patients [21.5% (95% CI 18-26)] and was ruled out by negative MSCT in 221 patients [51% (95% CI 46-56)]. MSCT scans were determined as inconclusive in 15 (4.5%) patients. No patient developed objectively verified venous thromboembolism (VTE) during the 3-month follow-up period. However, the cause of death was adjudicated as possibly related to PE in two patients, resulting in an overall 3-month VTE risk of 0.6% (95% CI 0-2.2%). The diagnostic algorithm yielded a definite diagnosis in 96.5% of the patients.This simple and non-invasive strategy combining clinical probability, D-dimer, and MSCT for the management of outpatients with suspected PE appears to be safe and effective.
