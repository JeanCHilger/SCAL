Role of biochemical markers in diagnosis of myocardial infarction. An ideal cardiac biochemical marker should have not only high sensitivity but also high specificity to myocardial infarction. The creatine kinase-MB, a relatively specific cardiac marker, could be elevated in situations other than acute myocardial infarction, such as renal failure, muscular injury, and myopathy. Although these are more specific than creatine kinase-MB, cardiac troponins have also been reported to be elevated in conditions other than acute myocardial infarction, such as chronic renal failure, acute myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, pulmonary embolism, rhabdomyolysis, sepsis, and left ventricular hypertrophy. With the ongoing research in this field, future holds hopes of finding an ideally specific marker of myocardial infarction, but until then biochemical markers should be used in conjunction with clinical assessment and electrocardiography in making the diagnosis of myocardial infarction, and the patients should not be treated merely on the basis of elevated serum levels of cardiac biochemical markers.
