Polycythemia vera and D-dimer-negative thromboembolism. A 65-year-old patient with polycythemia vera (PV) was admitted with a painful edema of the right arm lasting for 24 h. The D-dimer assay was negative. By phlebography the patient was diagnosed with a fresh thrombosis of the right subclavian vein. 1 week later she developed a D-dimer-negative symptomatic pulmonary embolism.If clinical signs of a thromboembolic event are present, the negative predictive value of the D-dimer assay is not sufficient to abandon further definitive diagnosis. Since thromboembolic events are frequent in PV patients, a prophylactic treatment with low-dose acetylsalicylic acid is recommended.
