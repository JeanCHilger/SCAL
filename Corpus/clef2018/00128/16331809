Expression of Fas and FasL in serum and placenta of preeclamptic pregnancy and its significance. To observe the serum and placental levels of FAS and FASL in preeclampsia (PE) and to study its relationship with the disease.Forty women with preeclampsia and 39 healthy pregnant women were recruited and samples of serum and placentas were collected. The expression of Fas and FasL in placentas was detected with Western blot and the concentration of soluble Fas and FasL in serum was detected with ELISA method.Serum levels of soluble Fas in PE group were significantly higher than those of healthy pregnant women (2.11+/-0.95 mg/L compared with 1.57+/-0.60 mg/L, P<0.05), and serum levels of soluble FasL in PE group were also significantly higher than those in controls (4.43+/-1.90 g/L compared with 3.48+/-1.53 g/L, P<0.01). There were no significant differences in Fas and FasL levels in placentas between PE group and healthy pregnant women (P>0.05 for both).The elevated serum Fas and FasL levels are closely associated with preeclampsia, which may play an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease.
