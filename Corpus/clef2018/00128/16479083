Trousseau's syndrome in association with cholangiocarcinoma: positive tests for coagulation factors and anticardiolipin antibody. Thromboembolic events are reported to occur with a high frequency in the setting of malignancy. However, reports on an association between cholangiocarcinoma and pulmonary thromboembolism, thus far, are almost lacking. We present here an unusual case of a 56-yr-old patient presenting cholangiocarcinoma and unexplained pulmonary thromboembolism. The patient had been quite healthy before the diagnosis. Coagulation tests showed elevated levels of fibrinogen, fibrinogen degradation product (FDP), D-dimer, and IgM anticardiolipin antibody (aCL Ab). The thromboemboli were resolved 3 weeks after anticoagulant therapy using low molecular-weight-heparin. Then, follow-up coagulation tests showed a marked decrease to normal in aCL Ab titer as well as the normalization of FDP and D-dimer levels. In this case, we describe pulmonary thromboembolism caused by hypercoagulable state associated with cholangiocarcinoma and speculate that such a thrombotic phenomenon could be regressed by anticoagulant therapy.
