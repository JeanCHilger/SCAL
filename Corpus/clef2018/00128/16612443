NT pro-BNP levels in pericardial diseases and how they are used as complementary evaluation method of diastolic restriction. Initial experience: 25 cases. To determine whether NT pro-BNP levels are high in patients reporting pericardial diseases, as well as to investigate how they relate to diastolic dysfunction echocardiographic measures.Twenty-five patients were split into two groups: 1) pericardial effusion (PE): 15 patients 2) constrictive pericarditis (CP): 10 patients. A control group was made up with 30 individuals reporting no heart disease. Pericardial effusion was evaluated by bidimensional echocardiogram, with restriction evaluated by pulsed Doppler of mitral flow. CP diagnosis was confirmed by MRI. NT pro-BNP levels were measured by immunoassay and detected by electrochemiluminescence.From the 15 PD patients, 14 reported relevant PD, and only 1, moderate PD. Log NT pro-BNP was shown to be higher in PD (p < 0.05), with log mean of 2.31 pg/ml and CP (p < 0.05), with log mean of 2.67 pg/ml, when compared to control group, log mean of 1.32 pg/ml. No difference was reported between PD and CP (p = 0.149). The NT pro-BNP log showed to be correlated to peak velocity of the E wave (r = 0.845 p = 0.001) and with E/A (r = 0.717NT pro-BNP is shown to have increased in pericardial diseases, and is associated to diastolic dysfunction. It may serve as an additional method in quantifying restriction.
