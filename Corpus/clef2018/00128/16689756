Management of primary care patients with suspected deep vein thrombosis: use of a therapeutic dose of low-molecular-weight heparin to avoid urgent ultrasonographic evaluation. Out of hospital management of patients with suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT) can be problematic. The accuracy of clinical prediction rules in the primary care setting may be inadequate, D-dimer testing may not be available, and the cost-effectiveness of urgent ultrasonographic evaluation is uncertain.The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of an empiric single therapeutic dose of low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in the time interval preceding ultrasound investigation in patients presenting to primary care physicians (PCPs) for suspicion of DVT.Consecutive patients with suspected DVT who presented to the office of a PCP outside regular thrombosis center working hours were enrolled. All eligible patients received a single therapeutic dose of LMWH (100 anti-Xa IU kg(-1) weight) and were scheduled to undergo clinical and instrumental evaluation at the thrombosis center the morning after. Clinical events were documented after a 3-month follow-up.A total of 534 consecutive patients with suspected DVT were included in this study of these 102 patients had subsequent diagnosis of DVT. We detected no episodes of pulmonary embolism, major bleeding, or death during the 18-h window between the administration of LMWH and objective evaluation. Of the 432 patients in whom diagnosis of DVT was subsequently excluded, only three (0.7%Empiric treatment with a single therapeutic dose of LMWH is effective and safe for outpatients with suspected DVT initially managed in a primary care setting. This strategy has the potential to reduce the need for urgent diagnostic imaging.
