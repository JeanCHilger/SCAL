Plasma heart-type fatty acid binding protein is superior to troponin and myoglobin for rapid risk stratification in acute pulmonary embolism. Irreversible right ventricular (RV) failure with myocardial damage may precipitate fatal outcome in acute pulmonary embolism (APE). Cytoplasmic heart-type fatty acid binding protein (H-FABP) is a sensitive and specific biomarker of myocardial damage. We assessed which biomarker of myocardial damage or RV stretching is the most useful for short-term risk stratification in APE.We analyzed 77 patients (51 F, 26 M) aged 65.3+/-16.0 years with confirmed APE. On admission, systemic blood pressure and transthoracic echocardiography (for RV overload) were recorded and plasma concentrations of myoglobin (Mb), cardiac troponin T (cTnT), N-terminal fragment of proBNP (NT-proBNP) and H-FABP were evaluated.Fifteen (19.5%) patients died and 24 (31.2%) experienced complicated clinical course (CCC)-death/thrombolysis/cardiopulmonary resuscitation/intravenous vasopressors. Hazard ratio analysis demonstrated that plasma H-FABP, Mb, cTnT and NT-proBNP concentrations predicted fatal outcome. When only APE-related deaths were considered, plasma H-FABP concentrations indicated fatal outcome. Multivariate hazard ratio analysis revealed H-FABP as the only 30-day mortality predictor (HR 1.02 CI 95% 1.01-1.05).H-FABP measured on admission is useful for short-term risk stratification in APE. It appears to be superior to cTnT, NT-proBNP and Mb in the prediction of 30-day APE-related mortality.
