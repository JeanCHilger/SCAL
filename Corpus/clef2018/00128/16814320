Cardiac inflammation contributes to right ventricular dysfunction following experimental pulmonary embolism in rats. Acute right ventricular (RV) failure following pulmonary embolism (PE) is a strong predictor of poor clinical outcome. Present studies test for an association between RV failure from experimental PE, inflammation, and upregulated chemokine expression. Additional experiments test if neutrophil influx contributes to RV dysfunction. PE was induced in male rats by infusing 24 microm microspheres (right jugular vein) producing mild hypertension (1.3 million beads/100 g, PE1.3), or moderately severe hypertension (2.0 million beads/100 g, PE2.0). Additional rats served as vehicle sham (0.01% Tween 20, Veh). In vivo RV peak systolic pressures (RVPSP) increased significantly, and then declined following PE2.0 (51 +/- 1 mm Hg 2 h 49 +/- 1, 6 h
