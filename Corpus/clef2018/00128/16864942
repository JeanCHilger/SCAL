Hemodynamic and clinical correlates of endothelin-1 in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. In non-thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, endothelin (ET)-1 levels are increased and correlate with the hemodynamic severity of the disease. Whether such correlations exist in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is unknown, nor whether ET-1 levels correlate with hemodynamic outcome after pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA).ET-1 levels were determined by ELISA. ET-levels were increased in 35 CTEPH patients (1.62+/-0.21 pg/ml) compared with healthy controls (n=11: 0.75+/-0.06 pg/ml, p<0.02). ET-1 levels correlated (all p<0.0001) with mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) (r=0.70), cardiac index (r=-0.76), total pulmonary resistance (r=0.72), mixed venous oxygen saturation (r=-0.87), and the distance walked in the 6-min walk test (r=-0.59 p<0.005ET-1 levels in CTEPH closely correlated with the hemodynamic and clinical severity of disease in a large cohort of patients. Preoperative ET-1 levels may be useful for better identification of patients at risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension after PEA.
