Economy-class syndrome or Immobile Traveler's syndrome?. Economy class syndrome describes the situation of patients who suffer pulmonary embolism following prolonged immobility in a long distance flight. The objective of the present study was to analyze whether there is a risk of pulmonary thromboembolism after a long overland journey. The study consecutively enrolled 100 patients diagnosed with pulmonary thromboembolism. Nine of them had previously undertaken a long journey (>5 h), 6 of which had been over land. Consequently, we think that the preventative measures recommended for airline passengers should be extended to users of other means of transport.
