D-dimer level is associated with the extent of pulmonary embolism. Our aim was to study the association between the level of D-dimer and the severity of pulmonary embolism (PE) as determined by various biochemical and radiological prognostic markers in order to investigate the potential value of D-dimer as a prognostic marker for the severity of PE.PE was diagnosed in 100 consecutive out-patients by multi-detector computerized tomography. One patient was excluded and the final cohort consisted of 99 patients. Pulmonary Artery Obstruction Index (PAOI) and Right Ventricular/Left Ventricular (RV/LV) ratio were assessed.The median value for D-dimer was 5.0 mg/L (inter-quartile range: 1.8, 12.2). There was a significant association between log D-dimer, and between log RV/LV (r=0.45), log PAOI (r=0.5), and PaO(2) (r=0.40). The multivariate analysis showed an increased association between log D-dimer and between log RV/LV ratio (r=0.54) and log PAOI (r=0.52) after adjusting for age, gender and for the duration of symptoms. Significant association was found between the level of D-dimer and the most proximal level of PE (p<0.0005). There was a significant dose-response relationship between the level D-dimer and between Troponin-T and the frequency of thrombolysis (p<0.0005). In the subgroup of patients with D-Dimer over the upper quartile (>12.2), 12 (67%) patients had elevated Troponin-T and 8 (32%) patients received thrombolysis, compared to 1 (5%) patient with elevated Troponin-T and none treated with thrombolysis in the subgroup of patients with D-dimer<lower quartile.We have shown that the level of D-dimer is related to the severity of PE assessed by various radiological, biochemical and clinical markers and might have a potential value as prognostic marker for the severity of PE.
