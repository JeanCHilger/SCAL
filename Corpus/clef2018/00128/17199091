Proteomic analysis of proteins differentially expressed in preeclamptic trophoblasts. To identify differential trophoblastic proteins associated with preeclampsia (PE) by proteomic analysis.We isolated and purified placental trophoblasts from normotensive pregnant women and patients with PE by a continuous Percoll gradient. The expression of proteins was determined by sliver staining after two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE). Proteins of interest were identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS).The overall trophoblastic protein expression patterns in preeclamptic and corresponding normotensive placentas were quite similar except for some areas. Of 34 differentially expressed protein spots (p < 0.05 by paired t-test), seven differential proteins from nine spots were identified by MALDI-TOF-MS. The expression of the following proteins was repressed (p < 0.01): disulfide isomerase ER-60, peroxiredoxin 2, and Delta3,5-Delta2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase. Four proteins (protein disulfide isomerase precursor, endoplasmic reticulum resident protein, dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase and TIM21-like protein) were found to be significantly upregulated in PE (p < 0.01).We identified several proteins with significant altered expression in PE using 2D-PAGE. This method is a powerful technique with which to search for not only quantitative but also qualitative changes in a biological process of interest.
