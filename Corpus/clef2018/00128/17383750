Increased troponin I predicts in-hospital occurrence of hemodynamic instability in patients with sub-massive or non-massive pulmonary embolism independent to clinical, echocardiographic and laboratory information. Whether in patients with acute central sub-massive or non-massive pulmonary embolism, mild troponin I increase (>0.03 mug/L) predicts in-hospital occurrence of hemodynamic instability and death independent to prognostically relevant clinical, laboratory and echocardiographic information is not fully established.We evaluated consecutively patients admitted to the Emergency Room for pulmonary embolism those in stable hemodynamics in whom central pulmonary embolism was confirmed by spiral-computed tomography were recruited. All participants underwent standardized study protocol, including clinical and diagnostic evaluation for assessment of severity of pulmonary embolismIn patients with acute central sub-massive or non-massive pulmonary embolism, even mild increase in troponin I >0.03 microg/L may provide relevant short-term prognostic information independent to clinical, laboratory and echocardiographic data.
