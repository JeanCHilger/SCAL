The quantitative immunoturbidimetric D-dimer method to rule out venous thromboembolism (VTE). D-dimer measurement is a technique that may improve the diagnostic strategy for venous thrombo-embolism (VTE). To evaluate D-dimer accuracy in the diagnosis of VTE, we identified 116 patients at Charleston Area Medical Center in Charleston, W.Va., for whom D-dimer assay had been performed to screen for VTE. Forty-one had VTE diagnosis confirmed (VTE-Positive) and 75 were ruled out (VTE-Negative)
