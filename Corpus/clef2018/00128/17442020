Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and assessment of microvascular density with CD 34 and endoglin in proliferative endometrium, endometrial hyperplasia, and endometrial carcinoma. The aim of this study was to compare vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), CD 34, and endoglin expressions as markers of angiogenesis in proliferative endometrium (PE), endometrial hyperplasia (EH), and endometrial carcinoma (EC) and to find the possible impact of angiogenesis on malign transformation. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from 12 patients with PE, 23 patients with simple EH and complex EH with atypia, and 31 patients with EC were included. A semiquantitative scoring system was used to assess the intensity and degree of staining of VEGF. Microvessel density (MVD) was assessed with endoglin and anti-CD 34 in most vascular areas. VEGF expression was significantly higher in EC and EH than PE, but there was no difference between EC and EH. According to CD 34 staining, there were no differences in MVD between groups. However, mean MVD counts assessed by endoglin were significantly higher in EC than PE and EH. Although VEGF expression in EC was significantly higher, it did not correlate with other measures of angiogenesis. MVD using endoglin seemed to reflect neoplastic angiogenesis better than CD 34.
