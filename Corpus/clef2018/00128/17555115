Diagnosis and management of deep venous thrombosis. Deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) is a common condition that can lead to complications such as postphlebitic syndrome, pulmonary embolism and death. Currently, an algorithm strategy combining pretest probability, D-dimer testing and compression ultrasonography imaging allows for safe and convenient estimation of suspected lower-limb thrombosis. The mainstay of treatment is anticoagulation therapy. The use of low-molecular-weight heparin or pentasaccharide (fondaparinux) allows for outpatient management of most patients with DVT. The duration of anticoagulation depends on whether the primary event was idiopathic or secondary to a transient risk factor. Interventions such as thrombolysis and placement of inferior vena cava filter are reserved for special situations.
