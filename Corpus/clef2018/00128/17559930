In vitro differentiation of villous trophoblasts from pregnancies complicated by intrauterine growth restriction with and without pre-eclampsia. Highly purified (>99.99%) primary villous cytotrophoblasts from uncomplicated pregnancies and pregnancies complicated with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) alone, IUGR with pre-eclampsia (IUGR-PE) and PE alone were cultured for 5days and the extent of differentiation into syncytiotrophoblasts measured in terms of syncytialisation and secretion of chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and placental lactogen (hPL). Three separate phenotypes were observed: (1) normal and IUGR-PE cells showed low syncytialisation and secretion of hCG and hPL, (2) IUGR cells showed the highest levels of syncytialisation and secretion and (3) PE cells showed high syncytialisation but low secretion. These results strongly suggest IUGR, IUGR-PE and PE to be distinct conditions in which villous cytotrophoblasts are either exposed to different environments or are genetically different.
