Purification and structure characterization of the active component in the pneumococcal 22F polysaccharide capsule used for adsorption in pneumococcal enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Protection against pneumococcal disease is thought to be mediated primarily by antibodies that are opsonic [Musher DM, Chapman AJ, Goree A, Jonsson S, Briles D, Baughn RE. Natural and vaccine-related immunity to Streptococcus pneumoniae. J Infect Dis 1986154(2):245-56]. Pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide (CPS) is immunogenic and induces type-specific protective immunity. For convenience, the protective capacity of serum antibodies is often evaluated by the measurement of antibody titers in an ELISA test. The pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide (CPS) used in ELISA contains several impurities
