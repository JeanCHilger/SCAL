Pulmonary embolism: clinical relevance, requirements for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. In the population the annual incidence of pulmonary embolism amounts to 1.3-2.8 per 1000 at the age of 65-89 years. Mortality reaches about 17% within the first 3 months. Acute pulmonary embolism is characterized by an increase in pulmonary arterial pressure and an impairment of the pulmonary gas exchange. Elevation of the right cardiac pressure up to right heart decompensation may follow. In addition, hypoxemia, hyperventilation, dead space ventilation, right to left shunting, bronchoconstriction, and vasoconstriction may occur. Clinical examination, ECG, laboratory findings such as elevated D-dimer, blood gas analysis, ultrasound examination of the veins of the lower extremities, and transthoracic echocardiography are acutely available diagnostic methods of an emergency department. In addition, extensive diagnostic procedures like pulmonary scintigraphy and pulmonary angiography may be required. The aim is to get a definite diagnosis as quickly as possible to direct therapy. In acute pulmonary embolism with cardiac shock, monitoring and stabilization of the circulatory function as well as an appropriate anticoagulant therapy are essential. In some cases surgery or a local fibrinolytic intervention is indicated.
