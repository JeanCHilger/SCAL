Time course of platelet aggregation during thrombolytic treatment of massive pulmonary embolism. We studied changes in platelet aggregation and fibrinogen levels during thrombolysis with massive or submassive pulmonary embolism. Fifteen patients were randomized into ultrahigh-dose streptokinase (UH-SK n = 8) or alteplase (tPA n = 7) groups. Arterial blood samples were taken before and after thrombolysis every 4 h between 4 and 36 h, and once daily between 2 and 30 days. In-vitro platelet aggregation was examined as spontaneous (0.9% NaCl) and induced aggregation with adrenaline 10 micromol/l, collagen 2 microg/ml and ADP 10 micromol/l. D-dimer and fibrinogen were measured every 8 h on first day, and later as above. In the UH-SK group, adrenaline-induced platelet aggregation decreased at 4 and 8 h compared with baseline (P < 0.03). Adrenaline-induced platelet aggregation was significantly lower in the UH-SK group than in the tPA group at 36 h and on day 3 (P < 0.03). Platelet aggregation induced by ADP was lower at 4 h than at baseline in the UH-SK group (P < 0.05). Collagen-induced platelet aggregation was lower at 4 and 8 h than at baseline (P < 0.05) in the UH-SK group. Compared with baseline, fibrinogen levels decreased in both groups after thrombolysis. D-dimer levels were elevated in both groups at 8 h (tPA group, P < 0.0004 UH-SK group, P < 0.05). Spontaneous platelet aggregation, major bleeding or re-embolism was not documented. Platelet aggregation decreased after thrombolysis with UH-SK for 12 h, in comparison tPA caused an insignificant decrease. Fibrinogen level decreased with UH-SK treatment for 5 days but in case of tPA we could not measure significant changes. According to our findings, tPA is a more suitable drug but streptokinase is also effective because of its cost-benefit ratio.
