Cellular features of the extra-embryonic endoderm during elongation in the ovine conceptus. The extraembryonic endoderm of the elongating ovine conceptus was analyzed by scanning and transmission electron microscopy and by whole mount actin staining and immunofluorescence. Morphological and functional differences between the visceral endoderm (VE), the founding cell layer, and the parietal endoderm (PE) are presented. During the elongation process, the PE differentiated to fusiform multinucleated cells aligned parallel to the elongation axis of the conceptus, whereas the VE cells retained the aspect of typical epithelial cells. The multinucleated PE cells however, expressed cellular and nuclear markers typical of endodermal and polarized epithelial cells. The proteins of the extracellular matrix, laminin, and fibronectin, were specifically expressed in the PE. The presence of pairs of nuclei linked by mid-bodies positively stained with tubulin antibodies, indicated that the syncytial differentiation of the PE was due to karyokinesis which was not followed by cytokinesis rather than by cell fusion.
