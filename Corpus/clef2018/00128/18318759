Prospective study of homocysteine and MTHFR 677TT genotype and risk for venous thrombosis in a general population--results from the HUNT 2 study. This case-cohort designed study prospectively investigated whether elevated homocysteine levels measured in blood samples drawn before the event and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene polymorphism (MTHFR C677T) were associated with subsequent first venous thrombosis (VT) in a general population. Between August 1995 and June 1997, blood was collected from 66 140 people in the second Norwegian Health Study of Nord-Tr√∏ndelag (HUNT2). During a seven-year follow-up, 505 VT cases were identified. 1458 age- and sex-matched controls were selected from the original cohort. Serum total homocysteine (tHcy) and MTHFR genotype were measured in stored samples that were drawn a median of 33 months before the events. The overall odds ratio (OR) was 1.50 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97-2.30] for homocysteine levels above versus below the 95th percentile. There was no graded association with VT over quintiles of homocysteine. In men the OR was 2.17 (95% CI 1.20-3.91) for levels above versus below the 95th percentile, but no association was found in women (OR 1.00). Stratification by age, predisposing risk factors or time to event did not change these results. The MTHFR 677TT genotype was not related to risk for VT. In conclusion, elevated homocysteine levels in the general population predicted subsequent first VT in men but not in women.
