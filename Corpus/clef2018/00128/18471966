Performance optimization of coagulation/flocculation in the treatment of wastewater from a polyvinyl chloride plant. This paper presents results of an experimental study of coagulation/flocculation process of wastewater generated from a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plant. The wastewater contains fine chlorine-based solid materials (i.e. latex). Experiments were carried out using a model wastewater which is chemically identical to the actual plant but is more consistent. Inorganic ions (Al2(SO4)3, FeCl3 and CaCl2) and a water soluble commercial polyelectrolyte (PE) were added to the wastewater sample. Coagulation efficiency was determined by measuring both the turbidity of the supernatants and the relative settlement of the flocs in the jar test. It was found that aluminum and ferric ions were more efficient than calcium ions as coagulants. The addition of polyelectrolyte was found to improve substantially the coagulation/flocculation process. It was found that the (Al2(SO4)3) combined with the polyelectrolyte at certain pH and agitation speed gave the best results compared to calcium chloride or ferric chloride when combined with the same concentration of polyelectrolyte. Only 0.0375g of a solution of (0.5% Al2(SO4)3) was required to coagulate the model wastewater. Ferric chloride (2.5% FeCl3) combined with the polyelectrolyte, on the other hand, required 0.1g while the optimum turbidity is almost the same. As for calcium chloride (2.5% CaCl2) it was found to be the least effective. The coagulation/flocculation process was found to be dependent on both pH and the agitation speed.
