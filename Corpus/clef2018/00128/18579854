Identification of proteomic biomarkers of preeclampsia in amniotic fluid using SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry. To identify proteomic biomarkers in amniotic fluid (AF) that can distinguish preeclampsia (PE) from chronic hypertension (CHTN) and normotensive controls (CTR).AF from women with PE, CHTN, and CTR were subjected to proteomic analysis by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.Proteomic profiling of AF identified 2 biomarkers: peak X (17399.11 Da), which distinguished PE from CTR, and peak Y (28023.34 Da), which distinguished PE and CHTN from CTR. High performance liquid chromatography fractions containing the biomarkers were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and in-gel tryptic digestion. The biomarkers were matched to proapolipoprotein A-I (peak Y) and a functionally obscure peptide, SBBI42 (peak X). Western blot analysis confirmed that AF from PE and CHTN had higher proapolipoprotein A-I levels than CTR.Proteomic analysis of AF can distinguish PE from CHTN and CTR. The discriminatory proteins were identified as proapolipoprotein A-I and SBBI42.
