Acute pulmonary embolism advances in treatment. Recent advances in interventional cardiology, pharmacotherapeutics and modern surgical management in tertiary cardiac care centers have tremendously improved the present treatment of Pulmonary Embolism (PE). CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA), nuclear lung scan (V/Q scan), D-dimer test and modern echocardiography have revolutionized the diagnostic methodology and risk assessment criteria. Cardiogenic shock or systolic hypotension (BP < 90 mmHg) and presence of right ventricular dysfunction (or failure) are two principal criteria which govern the severity of pulmonary embolism. While all patients of pulmonary embolism require anticoagulation, systemic thrombolytic therapy is the mainstay of initial treatment in massive and submassive pulmonary embolism. When thrombolysis is contraindicated or has failed, urgent surgical embolectomy or catheter embolectomy may be life saving procedures in severe pulmonary embolism.
