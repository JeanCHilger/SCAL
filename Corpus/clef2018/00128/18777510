Interleukin-18 and gestosis: correlation with Helicobacter pylori seropositivity. The aim of this brief communication was to determine the correlation between pre-eclampsia (PE), Helicobacter pylori pathogenic strains seropositivity, and interleukin-18 (IL-18) levels. To this purpose 25 pre-eclamptic women and 25 healthy parturient women of similar age were evaluated for: IL-18 levels, by ELISAH. pylori seropositivity, by anti-IgG ELISAAnti-Cag-A antibodies using a commercial immunoblot assay.We report similar values of IL-18 in our pre-eclamptic patients and in healthy parturient women (respectively 350 +/- 150 vs. 399 +/- 132 pg ml(-1) p = 0.23). However the seropositivity for H. pylori was 84 and 32% (p < 0.001), and anti-Cag-A antibodies were present respectively in 80 and 28% of the two populations. On the basis of our data we hypothesize that H. pylori infection from Cag-A strains can be involved in some cases of PE and that the microorganism could modulate IL-18 release. In fact, differences on IL-18 production have been described by different authors between pre-eclamptic and healthy pregnant women, independently from infective pathology.
