Vascular supply as a discriminating factor for pig preantral follicle selection. This research analyses how somatic and vascular compartments change during preantral follicle growth. To address this aim, theca-granulosa (somatic) proliferation indexes (PIs), proportion of proliferating endothelial cells (PE), vascular area (VA) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) expression were simultaneously recorded on single healthy preantral follicles, classified into six different stages on the basis of the diameter and the granulosa layers. An autonomous blood vessel network starts to appear only in class 3. Vascular remodelling requires VEGFA expression, and VEGFA mRNA and VA significantly increase between class 3 and classes 4 and 5 and, further, in class 6. In addition, a positive correlation exists between these parameters in classes 3-5. Despite variation in angiogenesis results from classes 3 to 5, the statistical analysis reveals that the vascular parameters are positively and strictly correlated with somatic PIs. Conversely, class 6, also characterized by higher values of somatic PIs, displays a stable proportion of PEs ( congruent with 40%) without showing any correlation among the different parameters analysed. To identify follicular subpopulations within different classes, a multivariate hierarchical cluster analysis was performed. This analysis reveals that the majority of classes 3 and 4 are quiescent follicles or structures that grow very slowly. Class 5 represents a transitory category, where half of the follicles maintain a low activity and the remaining express significantly higher levels of granulosa PI and VA. The follicles with this high activity are probably able to reach class 6 becoming dominant structures where somatic and vascular parameters are constantly on high levels and the VA remains the unique differentiating element.
