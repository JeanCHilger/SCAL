Recurrent thromboembolism due to increased acetylsalicylic acid-resistant platelet aggregation. A 49-year-old man had for 30 years suffered from severe recurrent thromboembolism with leg-vein thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, mesenteric infarction, cerebrovascular accident, cerebral vein thrombosis, portal vein thrombosis and femoral artery occlusion requiring leg amputation. In addition to moderately increased clotting activation with single-fold positive demonstration of fibrin monomers and a D-dimer concentration of 1 mg/l platelet aggregation was increased and could not be influenced by aspirin, 300 mg daily. Despite aspirin there were recurrent transitory attacks of cerebral ischaemia. Fibrin monomers were threefold positive and D-dimer concentration was increased to 4 mg/l (elevated clotting activation). Ticlopidine administration (250 mg daily) reduced adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation by 30% without effect on collagen-induced platelet aggregation. In parallel to these changes the patient's general condition clearly improved: fibrin monomers were no longer demonstrated and the D-dimer level fell to 0.5 mg/l.
