Second trimester neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin as a potential prediagnostic marker of preeclampsia. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) concentrations, a product of neutrophils, were investigated in normal and preeclamptic pregnancies. Prospectively collected data and late second trimester (24-26 weeks) serum samples from 48 women who subsequently developed preeclampsia (PE) and 96 control women with uncomplicated pregnancies were compared. Serum NGAL values, as determined by quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay, were significantly increased in the preeclamptic compared to the control women: 76.9 ng/ml (interquartile range 39.7-96.5) versus 16.0 ng/ml (interquartile range 11.2-24.4) (p<0.001), and were positively correlated to blood pressure and proteinuria, showing a high sensitivity (75%) and specificity (94.5%). The results suggest that serum NGAL might be involved in the pathophysiology of PE and could be a marker for this syndrome.
