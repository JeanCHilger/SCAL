Haemostatic factors in women with history of preeclampsia. Evaluation of haemostatic parameters--Plasma tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) and fibrin fragment D-dimer several years after the end of pregnancy to investigate if they are modified in women with history of preeclampsia (PE).65 healthy women with history of PE and 54 control women with previous normal pregnancy were enrolled in this study. Groups were matched for age, time period since delivery, smoking status and alcohol consumption. t-PA, PAI-1 and fibrin fragment D-dimer antigen levels were quantified using standards commercial ELISA methods. Plasma fibrinogen was measured using automated capillary zone electrophoresis.Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were higher in women with history of PE. Levels of t-PA, PAI-1 and fibrinogen were similar between groups as well as the t-PA/PAI-1 ratio. A significant increase in D-dimer levels was observed in women with history of PE.The increase in D-dimer level suggests an abnormal haemostatic potential namely increased intravascular coagulation. This, together with the increased blood pressure, can reflect a tendency for an increased risk of cardiovascular/thrombotic events later in life.
