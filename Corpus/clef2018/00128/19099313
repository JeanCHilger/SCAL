Plasma sFlt-1-to-PlGF ratio is correlated with inflammatory but not with oxidative stress in Chinese preeclamptic women. Considerable interest has been focused on angiogenic factors and angiogenic imbalance in the field of pre-eclampsia (PE), owing to its gaining role in the development of PE. This study was addressed to investigate the associations of sFlt-1-to-PlGF plasma ratios with oxidative stress assessed by the level of 8-isoprostane, and inflammation measured by the level of high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and adipocytokines.A total of 83 patients with PE including 47 mild PE (MPE) and 36 severe PE (SPE) and 50 age-matched normotensive subjects in the third trimester of pregnancy were examined. Measurements included body mass index (BMI), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) levels, plasma concentrations of hs-CRP, 8-isoprostane, adiponectin, and leptin.Subjects with PE had higher levels of sFlt-1/PlGF (P < 0.01), hs-CRP (P < 0.01), 8-isoprostane and leptin (both P < 0.01) and lower adiponectin (P < 0.01) than did normotensive control subjects. Significant positive correlations were found between plasma sFlt-1/PlGF and hs-CRP (r = 0.437, P < 0.01) or leptin (r = 0.656, P < 0.01). A weak inverse correlation emerged between sFlt-1/PlGF and adiponectin (r = -0.306, P < 0.01). When a multiple regression analysis was performed, with sFlt-1/PlGF as a dependent variable and all the other parameters as independent variables, sFlt-1/PlGF maintain a significant relationship with leptin (beta = 0.219, P < 0.05) and with hs-CRP (beta = 0.295, P < 0.01) as well as with systolic BP(beta = 0.446, P < 0.05).In Chinese preeclamptic women, plasma sFlt-1-to-PlGF ratio is correlated with inflammatory and adipocytokines but not with oxidative stress.
