Prevalence and incidence of deep venous thrombosis among patients in medical intensive care unit. A cross-sectional study was carried out to observe the prevalence, incidence and risk factors of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in patients from intensive care unit (ICU).Patients who were admitted to respiratory intensive care unit (RICU) and emergency intensive care unit (EICU) of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital and Beijing Anzhen Hospital were screened in our study. All patients enrolled underwent compression ultrasonography (CUS) within 48 h upon their admission to the ICUs. CUS was re-performed at 10 - 14 day, or when leaving ICU or at the time patients developed signs and symptoms (pain, heat, redness, edema) of DVT. Risk factors which were presumed associated with DVT were recorded. The main identified outcome was the presence of DVT. The secondary outcome was pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE).DVT was found in 30 patients of 252 patients within 48 h (11.90%). One hundred seventy-two patients were performed CUS two times or more. 26 patients (15.12%) had DVT. D-dimer, history of operation, kidney failure appeared to be independent risk factors for DVT in ICU patients. 13 patients were suspected PTE and 3 patients diagnosed as PTE.ICU doctors should pay more attention to DVT, which is relatively common in ICU patients.
