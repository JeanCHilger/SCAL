Fibrin degradation product D-dimer in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. The study objective was to determine the specificity and sensitivity of plasma concentrations of D-dimer, a fibrin degradation product, as a marker for ongoing thrombotic and thrombolytic events in pulmonary embolism. A prospective study was performed in 74 patients with suspected pulmonary embolism who appeared in the emergency room with dyspnea and/or chest pain. The presence of pulmonary embolism was established by positive findings either in pulmonary angiography or lung scan. D-dimer concentrations were determined in all patients. In 11 patients with positive pulmonary angiography, D-dimer concentrations were monitored for 6-12 days. D-dimer concentrations were determined by a quantitative enzyme-linked immunoassay. Plasma probes of 26 patients (16 with/10 without positive pulmonary angiography) were re-assayed with a semiquantitative latex agglutination assay. D-dimer levels were significantly higher in patients with pulmonary embolism (greater than 1000 ng/mL in 41 out of 43) than in those without (less than 1000 ng/mL in all 21 patients) (p less than 0.01). The sensitivity and specificity for the ELISA were found to be 95% and 100%, respectively, for establishing the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. In the latex assay the values were 81% and 60%, respectively. It is concluded that in patients with dyspnea and/or chest pain, determination of D-dimer in plasma by ELISA adds a valuable tool to the noninvasive diagnostic procedure for pulmonary embolism. From the time-course of D-dimer values we conclude that this assay might be valuable up to at least 6 days after symptom onset. The assay, however, is unreliable in malignancies or after surgery.
