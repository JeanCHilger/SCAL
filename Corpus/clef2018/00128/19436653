Alveolar dead space and capnographic variables before and after thrombolysis in patients with acute pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common condition. The central aim of this study was to describe the use of volumetric capnography (VCap) before and after fibrinolytic treatment of major PE. Lung scintigraphy was used as a base of comparison for the results of this treatment. We describe the cases of two conscious and spontaneously breathing patients (20- and by 24-year-old women) with major PE undergoing thrombolysis. Curves of CO(2) were obtained VCap and associated with arterial blood gas analysis and D-dimer. The pattern of VCap was compared with the VCap of health volunteers. Parameters also calculated were: P(a-et)CO(2) gradient, alveolar dead space fraction (AVDSf ), late dead space fraction (fDlate), and slope phase III (Slp III). The VCap results before and after thrombolysis for patients 1 and 2 were, respectively, P(a-et)CO(2): 12.6 to 5.8 and 7.9 to 1.6 (mmHg) AVDSf: 0.46 to 0.18 and 0.25 to 0.05
