Prospective diagnostic accuracy assessment of the HemosIL HS D-dimer to exclude pulmonary embolism in emergency department patients. Chest pain and shortness of breath are among the most common symptoms requiring immediate evaluation. Testing for pulmonary embolism (PE) has become easier and widespread due to D-dimer blood tests. Safe use of these tests is only possible if sensitivity is high and they are used in non-high probability patients. We evaluated diagnostic performance of the HemosIL HS D-dimer, which despite FDA approval in 2005, has been minimally reported in prospective standard clinical care.We used a prospective observational study design to follow patients in a single center with the HemosIL HS ordered for symptoms of possible PE with positive test result if >243 ng/ml. The outcome was PE or deep venous thrombosis (DVT) at the time of presentation or subsequent 45 days determined by structured evaluation of imaging tests, phone, or medical record follow-up in all patients.529 patients received a D-dimer and 4.7% were ultimately diagnosed with PE or DVT. The sensitivity of the HemosIL HS was 96.0% (95% CI 79.6 to 99.9%) specificity was 65.7% (95% CIThe HemosIL HS D-dimer had high sensitivity, very low negative post-test probability and is useful in excluding PE in the acute care setting.
