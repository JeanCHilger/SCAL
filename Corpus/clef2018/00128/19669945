Relationship between increases in pancreatic enzymes and cerebral events in children after traumatic brain injury. To describe the risk factors of early and delayed increases in pancreatic enzymes (PE) in children after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and to determine if cerebral events (such as intracranial hemorrhage or intracranial hypertension) are associated with increases in PE.Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected Pediatric Neurotrauma Registry for children with severe TBI (GCS â‰¤ 8). We assessed the association of clinical characteristics with the development of increases in PE using regression analyses.Fifty-one children with severe TBI were classified into three groups [normal PE early PE (PE increases within first 24 h)Increases in PE were observed in 29/51 children [57% total n = 9 (18%) earlyIncreases in PE, often used as the only measures of pancreatitis in children with other severe injuries, are common in children after severe TBI and delayed presentation appears related to intracranial events. This suggests a possible interaction between the brain and the gastrointestinal system, implying that disturbances in cerebral hemodynamics may lead to pancreatic dysfunction.
