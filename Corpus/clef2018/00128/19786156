Office management of deep venous thrombosis in the elderly. Deep venous thrombosis is common in the elderly. Diagnosis and management are now a part of office practice. As signs and symptoms are inconsistent and nonspecific, diagnostic testing is necessary. For patients with a low clinical probability, a normal D-dimer result can rule out disease. For patients with a high clinical suspicion or an elevated D-dimer, duplex ultrasonography may confirm the diagnosis. Anticoagulation, usually with low-molecular-weight heparin, should begin on suspicion and continue, along with warfarin, until the international normalized ratio is therapeutic. Arrangements for the initial daily injections can be made with a visiting nurse. Treatment should continue for at least 3 months, when a risk-versus-benefit analysis for continuing anticoagulation should be undertaken. Therapy may be discontinued for thromboses associated with a reversible risk factor or for patients in whom anticoagulant management was unstable or complicated by bleeding. A persistently high D-dimer result or evidence of residual clot on repeat duplex ultrasonography may support continuation. For all patients, the use of compression stockings to prevent the post-thrombotic syndrome is recommended.
