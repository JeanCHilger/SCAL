Clinical significance of physiological function testing in cardiovascular disease. Acute coronary syndrome most commonly begins with atherosclerotic plaque rupture and intracoronary thrombus formation. Therefore, the primary goal of treatment for acute coronary syndrome is the achievement of early and complete reperfusion. The diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is made from typical symptoms, characteristic rises in serum enzyme levels, and changes in the electrocardiographic pattern. Although rapid developments in technology in the field of serum biomarkers have redefined the diagnosis of AMI, the electrocardiogram still remains significant in the diagnosis of AMI. Moreover, the identification of high-risk subgroups based on the admission electrocardiogram is essential to estimate the severity of AMI. Pulmonary embolism is an another thromboembolic disorder leading to mortality worldwide. The relationship between deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism has been emphasized. The early detection of free-floating deep venous thrombosis by venous ultrasonography of the lower extremities is critical to prevent pulmonary embolism. For the detection of atherosclerosis, the identification of myocardial necrosis and thrombi by imaging tests is important. This paper reports the clinical usefulness of various noninvasive diagnostic approaches in cardiovascular disease.
