Alteration in chromogranin A, obestatin and total ghrelin levels of saliva and serum in epilepsy cases. This study was designed to measure the levels of chromogranin A (CgA), ghrelin and obestatin in serum and saliva (including CgA expression in healthy tissue) in epileptic patients to determine any significant differences between these patients and healthy controls. Samples were obtained from a total of 91 subjects: 10 newly-diagnosed primary generalized epilepsy (PGE) patients who had started treatment with valproic acid and phenytoin for seizure control 18 PGE patients who were previously and currently receiving treatment with valproic acid and phenytoin for seizure control
