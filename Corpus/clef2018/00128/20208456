Serum levels of the adipokine lipocalin-2 are increased in preeclampsia. Preeclampsia (PE) is a serious complication in pregnancy which increases the future risk for vascular and metabolic disease in both mother and newborn. Recently, lipocalin-2 has been introduced as a novel adipokine which contributes to obesity, insulin resistance, and vascular disease.In the current study, we investigated lipocalin-2 serum levels in PE patients as compared to healthy gestational age-matched controls.Lipocalin-2 serum concentrations were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in control (no.=22) and PE (no.=22) patients. Furthermore, lipocalin-2 levels were correlated to clinical and biochemical measures of renal function, glucose, and lipid metabolism, as well as inflammation.Median maternal lipocalin-2 concentrations were significantly increased in PE (121.3 μg/l) as compared to control subjects (99.8 μg/l) (p<0.05). Furthermore, circulating lipocalin 2 correlated positively with diastolic blood pressure, creatinine, and C reactive protein. In multivariate analyses, creatinine and C reactive protein remained independently associated with lipocalin-2 levels.We demonstrate that maternal lipocalin-2 concentrations are significantly increased in PE. Furthermore, markers of renal function and inflammation independently predict circulating lipocalin-2.
