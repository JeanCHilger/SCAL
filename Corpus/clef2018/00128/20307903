Increases in circulating matrix metalloproteinase-9 levels following fibrinolysis for acute pulmonary embolism. Fibrinolyis is one of the first line therapies in high risk pulmonary embolism (PE) according to current guidelines. Previous studies showed that fibrinolytic therapy with tPA (tissue plasminogen activator, or alteplase) upregulates the concentrations of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and contributes to hemorrhagic transformation after cardioembolic stroke. However, no previous study has described the circulating MMPs levels following fibrinolysis for acute PE.We serially measured the circulating levels of MMPs (MMP-9 and MMP-2) and their endogenous inhibitors, the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and TIMP-2 in alteplase and in streptokinase-treated patients with acute PE by gelatin zymography and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, respectively.We found that therapy of PE streptokinase or with alteplase is associated increased pro-MMP-9, but not MMP-2, concentrations for up to 24hours, whereas no significant changes were found in TIMP-1 or TIMP-2 concentrations. This alteration returned to normal 3 to 5days after thrombolysis. This is the first study reporting on MMPs alterations following fibrinolysis for acute PE.We found transient increases in circulating pro-MMP-9 levels following fibrinolysis for acute PE. Our findings support the hypothesis that increased MMP-9 levels may underlie the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage or other bleeding complication of thrombolysis for acute PE, and the use of MMP inhibitors may decrease such risk.
