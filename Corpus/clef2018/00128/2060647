Influence of the steric barrier activity of amphipathic poly(ethyleneglycol) and ganglioside GM1 on the circulation time of liposomes and on the target binding of immunoliposomes in vivo. A series of dioleoyl N-(monomethoxy polyethyleneglycol succinyl)phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-PE) of different polymer chain length was used in this study. Both the activity of PEG-PE in prolonging the circulation time of liposomes and the relative steric barrier activity of amphipathic polymer, measured by a liposome agglutination assay, were found to be directly proportional to the chain length of PEG-PE (PEG5000-PE greater than PEG2000-PE greater than PEG750-PE). However, PEG5000-PE caused a reduced target binding of immunoliposomes in mice due to its overly strong steric barrier activity. The best PEG-PE species supporting the target binding of immunoliposomes was PEG2000-PE, the activity of which was compatible to that of ganglioside GM1. However, GM1 only showed a weak steric barrier activity, suggesting a different mechanism for this glycolipid.
