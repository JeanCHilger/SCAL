Growth differentiation factor 15--a new marker in heart diseases. Growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) is a cytokine with cardioprotective properties, which inhibits hypertrophy, cardiac remodeling and apoptosis. Participates in the life and cell death. The concentration of GDF-15 rapidly increases under the influence of ischemia-reperfusion damage to heart muscle, oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokines and pressure overload. In patients with acute coronary syndromes, heart failure and pulmonary embolism provides independent prognostic information, both short-and long-term. It is potentially a new marker of risk stratification in patients with heart disease and therapeutic decision making.
