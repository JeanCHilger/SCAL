Clinical significance of antiphospholipid antibodies in cases with pulmonary thromboembolism. Anti-cardiolipin IgG antibodies among antiphospholipid antibodies were measured qualitatively and quantitatively in 46 cases with pulmonary thromboembolism. We investigated occurrence frequency among non-collagen diseases and collagen-disease-complicated cases, clinical course, abnormalities of blood coagulation time, prosperity and decay of the antibodies in antibody positive cases. Many of the collagen-disease-complicated cases were chronic, progressive and had multiple thromboses and prolongation of blood coagulation time. Antiphospholipid antibodies were also detected in antibody-positive non-collagen disease cases and the rate was 8 out of 40 cases (20%). In such antibody-positive non-collagen disease cases multiple thromboses over the whole body, and abnormalities of blood coagulation time in vitro were also detected, but the occurrence rate was not so frequent compared with antibody-positive collagen disease cases. The antibody was continuously positive even a year after an acute episode of pulmonary thromboembolism in antibody positive collagen disease cases. On the other hand, the antibody had a tendency to disappear in antibody-positive non-collagen disease cases several months after such an acute episode.
