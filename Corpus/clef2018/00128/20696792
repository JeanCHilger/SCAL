Changes in coagulation indexes and occurrence of venous thromboembolism in patients with Cushing's syndrome: results from a prospective study before and after surgery. To evaluate whether patients with Cushing's syndrome (CS) had i) changes in coagulative and fibrinolytic parameters associated with CS activity and ii) higher prevalence of venous thromboembolic events (VTE).Prospective study conducted on patients with CS evaluated at diagnosis and 12 months after surgery.Forty patients with active CS (36 with Cushing's disease (CD) and 4 with an adrenal adenoma) were evaluated. Forty normal subjects and 70 patients with non-ACTH-secreting pituitary adenomas served as controls. All patients and controls underwent an assessment of coagulation and fibrinolysis indexes before and after surgery.CS patients at baseline had a hypercoagulative phenotype when compared with normal subjects (activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen, D-Dimer, von Willebrand factor (VWF), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1 or SERPINE1), antithrombin III (ATIII or SERPINC1), P<0.0001, α(2) antiplasmin, P=0.0004, thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), P=0.01, factor IX (F9), P=0.03). Patients with still active disease after surgery had higher coagulative parameters than those in remission (VWF (P<0.0001), PAI-1 (P=0.004), TAT (P=0.0001), ATIII (P=0.0002) and α(2) antiplasmin (or SERPINF2 P=0.006)), whereas aPTT levels (P=0.007) were significantly reduced. VTE occurred in three patients with CD (7.5%): one had a pulmonary embolism and two patients had a deep venous thrombosisPatients with CS have a procoagulative phenotype due to cortisol-associated changes in haemostatic and fibrinolytic markers, leading to increased incidence of VTE. Thromboprophylaxis seems to be appropriated in patients with active disease, particularly in the postoperative period.
