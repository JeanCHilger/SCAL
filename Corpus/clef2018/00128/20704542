Evaluation of D-dimer in the diagnosis of suspected aortic dissection. The goal of this study was to evaluate plasma D-dimer as a diagnostic marker for exclusion of suspected aortic dissection (AD).Two-hundred and sixty suspected AD patients were enrolled, including acute AD, n=107 chronic AD, n=17The D-dimer concentrations in both the acute AD group [median: 3.47 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.43-4.50 Î¼g/mL] and chronic AD group (median: 1.09D-dimer may be used as a potential marker for suspected AD, with high sensitivity of up to 99.2% (1/124). Regardless of the cut-off threshold selected, the sensitivity of D-dimer was unable to reach 100%. Further examinations, including imaging technology, were necessary to diagnose the suspected AD patients who had negative D-dimer result.
