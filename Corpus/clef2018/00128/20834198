Serum heart-type fatty acid binding protein levels in acromegaly patients. Heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP) is a major cytoplasmic low molecular weight protein and released into the circulation when the myocardium is injured. Previous studies have demonstrated that H-FABP is closely associated with acute coronary syndrome, hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy, heart failure, stroke, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, and pulmonary embolism. The aim of this study was to investigate serum H-FABP value in patients with acromegaly.We measured serum H-FABP levels in 30 consecutive patients with acromegaly, and 55 age-matched control subjects by using a sandwich enzymelinked immunosorbent assay. Serum H-FABP levels were significantly higher in patients with acromegaly than in control subjects (17.40 ± 10.70, and 8.30 ± 7.20, respectively) (p<0.001). A significant positive correlation was found by Spearman's correlation test between serum H-FABP levels and left ventricular end-systolic diameter (r=0.483, p=0.004).Patients with acromegaly have increased levels of H-FABP. Serum H-FABP levels might be a marker of myocardial performance in patients with acromegaly.
