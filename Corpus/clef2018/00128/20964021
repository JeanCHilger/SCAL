When D-dimers within normal limits do not equate to normal D-dimers. Pulmonary embolism is a difficult diagnosis that may be missed because of an aspecific clinical presentation. Being the most accurate to confirm or exclude the disease is a matter of concern, as effective treatment exists and a possibly fatal outcome without it. Scores and guidelines can help us. However, they cannot replace clinical sense. What are the options when laboratory results put us on the wrong track, such as in a patient with a clinical presentation suggestive of a pulmonary embolism, but whose D-dimers are within the normal range?
