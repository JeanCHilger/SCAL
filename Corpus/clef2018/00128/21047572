Diagnosis: use of clinical probability algorithms. Evidence suggests that patients with suspected pulmonary embolism are managed better with a diagnostic strategy that includes clinical pretest probability assessment, D-dimer test, and/or imaging. Several clinical prediction rules have been described in the literature during the last decade. This review focuses on the role of clinical prediction rules in the diagnostic process and their clinical application into diagnostic algorithms.
