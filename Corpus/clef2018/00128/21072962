Cancer patient with dyspnoe--remember the possibility of pulmonary tumor microembolism. We report two patients with breast cancer who presented with a subacute course of progressive dyspnoe and shortness of breathing, culminating in respiratory failure and cardiovascular collapse from acute right heart failure. D-dimer serum levels were elevated and right ventricle strain (electrocardiogram) and pulmonary hypertension were also present. Clinical investigation and computed tomography of the chest were inconclusive. The autopsy study revealed multiple intravascular carcinomatous emboli in small arterioles of pulmonary vasculature. In the differential diagnosis of unexplained severe dyspnoe and pulmonary hypertension, malignancy should always be kept in mind.
