Computerized alert reduced D-dimer testing in the elderly. To assess the effect of a targeted age-specific computerized alert to reduce D-dimer testing in elderly patients.A single-crossover cluster randomized trial of computerized alerts during physician order entry involving 8 ambulatory care clinics in a group-model integrated care delivery system.The rate of completed D-dimer tests per 1000 patient visits, ratio of completed venous ultrasonography to completed D-dimer tests, and rate of completed venous ultrasonography per 1000 patient visits.The rate of completed D-dimer tests per 1000 visits among patients 65 years and older in intervention clinics decreased from 5.02 to 1.52 (95% confidence interval [CI], -4.20 to -2.80 P <.001), which persisted throughout the study period. The rate of completed D-dimer tests per 1000 visits among patients 65 years and older in control clinics decreased from 3.14 to 2.11 (95% CI, -1.66 to -0.04An electronic age-specific alert targeted to a specific condition reduced D-dimer testing in this elderly population of outpatients and demonstrated a persistent effect.
