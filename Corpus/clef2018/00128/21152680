Risk assessment of recurrence of venous thromboembolism. Recurrent venous thromboembolism is associated with increased mortality in 5-9% of the patients. On the other hand prolonged anticoagulation can increase the bleeding risk which can also be responsible for an increased mortality. Therefore, it is necessary to validate the recurrence risk of venous thromboembolism on an individual basis. In this review the most relevant risk factors for recurrent venous thromboembolism are analyzed. Spontaneous thrombosis is associated with significantly increased recurrence rates in comparison to risk associated venous thrombosis. In addition, a positive D-dimer result after stop of anticoagulation, an increased amount of residual thrombus in proximal veins analyzed by compression sonography, a proximal localization of thrombosis, symptomatic pulmonary embolism and male sex are clinically relevant risk factors for increased recurrence rates. While mild thrombophilic defects like heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation are not associated with a clinically relevant recurrence risk, inherited inhibitor deficiencies and the antiphospholipid-syndrome are known to be responsible for an increased recurrence rate of venous thromboembolism. A new recurrence risk-score (RR-Score) for individual judgement of patients with a first spontaneous venous thrombosis is introduced.
