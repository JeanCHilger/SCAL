Studies on anti-platelet activation effect and partial mechanisms of Taohong Siwu decoction. To explore the anti-platelet activation effect and partial mechanisms of Taohong Siwu decoction (TSD).The effect to venous thrombosis model and pulmonary thromboembolism model induced by vein injecting ADP and Adr was observed. The platelet adhesion rate was analyzed by using spinning glass bottle, and the platelet aggregation rate induced by ADP, Adr was analyzed by using turbidimetry. The acute blood stasis rat model was established to analyze the content of plasm TXB2 and PGI2 by RIA, and the content of VWF, GMP-14 by ELISA.TSD could effectively reduce platelet the adhesion rate of normal rat, inhibit the platelet aggregation of normal rat induced by ADP, Adr. It significantly reduced the plasma TXB2 VWF, and GMP-140 level of blood stasis rats. It also had significant tendency to increase 6-keto-PGF1alpha level.TSD possessed obvious activity of inhibiting platelet activation. The mechanism related with the restraining of platelet adhesion, platelet aggregation and platelet releasion.
