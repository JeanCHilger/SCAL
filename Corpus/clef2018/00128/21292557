Peripheral blood galectin-1-expressing T and natural killer cells in normal pregnancy and preeclampsia. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the proportion of galectin-1-expressing peripheral blood T and NK cells is altered in normal pregnancy and preeclampsia (PE). We also examined whether circulating levels of galectin-1 and anti-galectin-1 autoantibodies are affected in PE. Seventy preeclamptic patients, 75 healthy pregnant and 21 healthy non-pregnant women were involved in this study. Serum galectin-1 and anti-galectin-1 autoantibody levels were measured by ELISA. Intracellular galectin-1 expression of lymphocytes was determined with flow cytometry. Serum galectin-1 and anti-galectin-1 IgG levels did not differ significantly between the healthy pregnant and the PE group. In healthy pregnant women, significantly higher percentage of T and NK cells expressed gal-1 in their cytoplasma than in healthy non-pregnant women. However, the proportion of galectin-1-expressing peripheral blood T and NK cells was markedly decreased in PE compared to normal pregnancy, which might contribute to the activation of innate and acquired immune cells.
