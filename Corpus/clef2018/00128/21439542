Fetal hemoglobin and α1-microglobulin as first- and early second-trimester predictive biomarkers for preeclampsia. The aim of this study was to evaluate fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and α(1)-microglobulin (A1M) in maternal serum as first-trimester biomarkers for preeclampsia (PE).The design was a case-control study. We included 96 patients in the first trimester of pregnancy (60 with PE and 36 controls). Venous serum samples were analyzed for HbF and total hemoglobin (Hb) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and for A1M by radioimmunoassay. Sensitivity and specificity was calculated by logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.The HbF/Hb ratio and A1M concentration were significantly elevated in serum from women with subsequent development of PE (P < .0001). The optimal sensitivity and specificity was obtained using the biomarkers in combination 69% sensitivity for a 5% screen positive rate and 90% sensitivity for a 23% screen positive rate.The study suggests that HbF/Hb ratio in combination with A1M is predictive biomarkers for PE.
