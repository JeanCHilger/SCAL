Recent Korean perspective of deep vein thrombosis after total knee arthroplasty. This prospective study was performed on 311 consecutive knees in 227 patients for total knee arthroplasty. The aim was to assess the recent incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) after total knee arthroplasty without chemoprophylaxis in Koreans, the efficacy of plasma d-dimer levels as a screening test, and the associated risk factors. Deep vein thrombosis was found in 79 knees (26.60%). There were 9 cases (3.03%) of proximal DVT, 70 cases (23.57%) of distal DVT, and no symptomatic pulmonary embolism. Although this cohort had limited number of patients by a single surgeon, there is still low incidence of proximal DVT in Koreans with rare pulmonary embolism occurrence compared with those of the Western. High postoperative d-dimer levels were correlative, but no appropriate cutoff value was found. Obesity was a significant associated risk factor.
