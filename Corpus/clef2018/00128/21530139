Pulmonary embolism in pediatrics. Pulmonary embolism (PE), an uncommon diagnosis in pediatric patients, is a potentially life-threatening condition with significant morbidity and mortality. Improvements in pediatric care have resulted in survival of more chronically and critically ill children and thus, an increased number of pediatric patients at risk for this disease.We review the pathophysiology, risk factors, presentation, diagnosis, and initial management of PE in pediatric patients presenting to the Emergency Department.Although there is a significant lack of pediatric-specific literature pertaining to the diagnosis and management of PE, there are clear differences in the emergency approach to these patients, including specific risk factors and the inutility of clinical decision rules and D-dimer. CONCLUSION/SUMMARY: We outline these differences and present rational diagnostic and treatment algorithms.
