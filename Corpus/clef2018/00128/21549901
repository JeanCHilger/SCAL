Risk factors for recurrent venous thromboembolism. Recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) is frequent and can be fatal. Long-term antithrombotic treatment reduces the risk of recurrent VTE but increases the risk of bleeding and, therefore, cannot be proposed for all patients. Predicting the probability of recurrence in an individual patient is of utmost importance for assessing the risk-benefit ratio of long-term anticoagulation. Multiple clinical risk factors for recurrent VTE have been identified which include: unprovoked first episode, anatomical proximal location, male gender, residual venous thrombosis, cancer and antiphospholipid syndrome. d-dimer level after discontinuation of oral anticoagulation can help to predict the risk of recurrence with a good negative predictive value. Finally, genetic polymorphisms and rare inherited deficiencies of natural anticoagulant proteins do not seem to be strongly associated to recurrence. New antithrombotic drugs may, in the near future, improve the safety and of long-term anticoagulation treatment.
