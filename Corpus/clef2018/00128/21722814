Oxidative stress changes in pregnant patients with and without severe preeclampsia. The etiology of preeclampsia (PE) is unknown and the only treatment is removal of the fetus and placenta. The critical changes of this state include the increase of vascular resistance and hypoperfusion in the uteroplacental microcirculation that predispose to hypoxia and ischemia and, therefore, increased oxidative stress through 8-isoprostane, which is characterized by damage to the placenta and endothelium. We undertook this study to compare oxidative stress in pregnant women with PE.A case-control, cross-sectional and comparative study was undertaken. Pregnant women between 28 and 38 weeks of gestation with and without PE were recruited. Venous blood samples were taken for determination of 8-isoprostane. Obstetrical variables were measured and 8-isoprostane by radioimmunoassay. SPSS v.11 for Windows was used for descriptive statistics. Mean ± standard deviation, correlation and χ(2) were used for comparison between groups.We studied 45 patients: 20 with PE (44.6%) and 25 without PE (55.4%). The average for 8-isoprostane in preeclamptic patients was 699.2 ± 38.6 pg/dl and without PE was 113.9 ± 52.4 pg/dL (p <0.01), gestational age 32.1 ± 2.6 and 35.1 ± 1.8 weeks, birth weight 1880 ± 238 g and 2787 ± 312 g, respectively. Apgar at birth was similar in both groups.We found statistical differences in the 8-isoprostane levels in both groups. There was no correlation in perinatal results in both groups according to 8-isoprostane levels. These results could be the basis for the use of antioxidants in the management of PE to counteract tissue damage.
