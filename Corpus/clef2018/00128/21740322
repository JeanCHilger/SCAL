Cystatin C in pre-eclampsia. To evaluate diagnostic value of cystatin C serum levels as alternative marker of renal function in pre-eclamsia (PE) and compare it with the traditional markers of renal function, creatinine and uric acid. In order to investigate the possible influence of inflammation on biochemical markers of renal function, serum levels of high sensitive CRP were measured (hsCRP).In this prospective study markers of kidney function were investigated in two groups of pregnant women: one with PE (n = 32) and the other of healthy pregnant women (n = 60). Serum cystatin C levels were measured as well as levels of traditional renal markers creatinin and uric acid and levels of high sensitive C-reactive protein.Serum levels of cystatin C, creatinine and uric acid were significantly higher in the PE group than in the control group. Serum levels of hsCRP were higher in approximately the same number of patients with PE (50%) as in normal pregnancies (40%), without significant differences in CRP values between the two groups of patients.Cystatin C serum level may have significant role as a marker of pre-eclampsia specially when used in combination with uric acid levels.
