Examination of risk factors for deep vein thrombosis following total hip arthroplasty. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is the main cause of pulmonary thrombolism (PE). Thus by preventing DVT, the risk of PE can be greatly reduced.Patients were divided into two groups: a group of patients who were affected with DVT after total hip arthroplasty (THA) and a group of patients who were not affected. To examine the risk factor for DVT after THA, a comparative analysis between these two groups was performed.According to the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the preoperative elevated value of D-dimer is a significant risk factor which is only relative to the onset of DVT after THA. In addition, it was suggested that the preoperative value of D-dimer could be used as a means to rule out DVT after THA.It is useful to investigate the preoperative value of D-dimer as a predictive factor for the occurrence of DVT after THA.
