Emergency department point of care testing: what are the benefits and for which patients?. Laboratory tests contribute to patient length of stay in the emergency department. Therefore, rapid tests performed at the bedside (POCT or point of care testing) are attractive because they allow the emergency physician to obtain immediate biological, diagnostic and/or prognostic data. Userfriendly and with validated analytical performance, POCT have the potential to reduce laboratory time, patient length of stay and time to treatment or disposition. The expected benefit from POCT implementation will depend on the type of patients involved (inpatient or outpatient), their clinical condition and their overall care. Furthermore, logistical and economic implications should also be taken into account.
