Threshold of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1/placental growth factor ratio for the imminent onset of preeclampsia. It has not been clarified whether thresholds of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1), placental growth factor (PlGF), soluble endoglin, and the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio for the imminent onset of preeclampsia (PE) exist. We hypothesized that onset thresholds for the imminent onset of PE could be determined by the distributions of these 4 markers just after the onset of PE. Study subjects were 51 PE after the onset of PE 36 of PE, 20 of gestational hypertension, 142 of a small-for-gestational-age infant, and 400 of normal pregnant controls at 19 to 25 and 27 to 31 weeks of gestation in a prospective cohort study. The current data supported our hypothesis that onset thresholds of sFlt-1 and the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio exist. The onset thresholds of the sFlt-1/PlGF at 26 to 31 weeks of gestation were useful for detecting imminent PE with the onset at <36 weeks of gestation, showing sensitivity of 0.36 and a positive likelihood ratio and 95th percent CIs of 38 (11-132)
