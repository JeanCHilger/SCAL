The sFlt-1/PlGF ratio in different types of hypertensive pregnancy disorders and its prognostic potential in preeclamptic patients. The soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase (sFlt-1)/placental growth factor (PlGF) ratio is a reliable tool in the assessment of preeclampsia. We tested the hypothesis that the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio is able to identify women at risk for imminent delivery. We characterized the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio in different types of hypertensive pregnancy disorders.We investigated 388 singleton pregnancies with normal pregnancy outcome, 164 with PE, 36 with gestational hypertension, and 42 with chronic hypertension. sFlt-1 and PlGF were measured in serum samples.Patients with preeclampsia had a significantly increased sFlt-1/PlGF ratio as compared with controls and with patients with chronic and gestational hypertension in <34 weeks and â‰¥34 weeks (P < .001). Time to delivery was significantly reduced in women with preeclampsia in the highest quartile of the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio (P < .001).The sFlt-1/PlGF ratio allows the identification of women at risk for imminent delivery and is a reliable tool to discriminate between different types of pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders.
