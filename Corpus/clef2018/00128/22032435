Clinical review of pulmonary embolism: diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common disease causing significant morbidity, mortality, and substantial socioeconomic costs. The correct diagnosis and management of PE, however, offers many challenges. As a result, ongoing research continues to develop and refine new and existing diagnostic and prognostic tools, as well as therapeutic interventions, leading to significant improvements in the care of PE over the past 2 decades. This article summarizes the current literature to aid the clinician in the correct integration and implementation of these advances in the treatment of PE.
