Diagnostic approach to deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in the critical care setting. Considerable progress has been made during the last 30 years in the prevention, diagnosis, and therapy of venous thromboembolism. This article discusses the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical presentation of the disease as well as the diagnostic uncertainty that exists in the critical care setting. Diagnostic approaches for deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are considered, including clinical prediction rules, D-dimer, contrast venography, duplex ultrasonography, computed tomographic angiography and venography, magnetic resonance imaging, ventilationâ€“perfusion scanning, chest radiograph, arterial blood gases, electrocardiography, and echocardiography.
