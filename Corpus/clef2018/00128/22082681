Predictive value of the high-sensitivity troponin T assay and the simplified Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index in hemodynamically stable patients with acute pulmonary embolism: a prospective validation study. The new, high-sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT) assay may improve risk stratification of normotensive patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE). We externally validated the prognostic value of hsTnT, and of the simplified Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (sPESI), in a large multicenter cohort.We prospectively examined 526 normotensive patients with acute PE of those, 31 (5.9%) had an adverse 30-day outcome. The predefined hsTnT cutoff value of 14 pg/mL was associated with a high prognostic sensitivity and negative predictive value, comparable to those of the sPESI. Both hsTnT â‰¥14 pg/mL (OR, 4.97 [95% CI, 1.71-14.43]The hsTnT assay and the sPESI improve risk stratification of acute PE. Combination of both modalities may yield additive prognostic information and particularly identify possible candidates for out-of-hospital treatment.
