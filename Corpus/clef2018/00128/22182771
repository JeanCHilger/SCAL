Multifunctional PEGylated 2C5-immunoliposomes containing pH-sensitive bonds and TAT peptide for enhanced tumor cell internalization and cytotoxicity. pH-sensitive PEGylated (with PEG-PE) long-circulating liposomes (HSPC:cholesterol and Doxil®), modified with cell-penetrating TAT peptide (TATp) moieties and cancer-specific mAb 2C5 were prepared. A degradable pH-sensitive hydrazone bond between a long shielding PEG chains and PE (PEG(2k)-Hz-PE) was introduced. TATp was conjugated with a short PEG(1k)-PE spacer and mAb 2C5 was attached to a long PEG chain (2C5-PEG(3.4k)-PE). The "shielding" effect of TATp by long PEG chains was investigated using three liposomal models. At normal pH, surface TATp moieties are "hidden" by the long PEG chains. Upon the exposure to lowered pH, this multifunctional carrier exposes TATp moieties after the degradation of the hydrazone bond and removal of the long PEG chains. Enhanced cellular uptake of the TATp-containing immunoliposomes was observed in vitro after pre-treatment at lowered pH (using flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy techniques). The presence of mAb 2C5 on the liposome surface further enhanced the interaction between the carrier and tumor cells but not normal cells. Furthermore, multifunctional immuno-Doxil® preparation showed increased cellular cytotoxicity of B16-F10, HeLa and MCF-7 cells when pre-incubated at lower pH, indicating TATp exposure and activity. In conclusion, a multifunctional immunoliposomal nanocarrier containing a pH-sensitive PEG-PE component, TATp, and the cancer cell-specific mAb 2C5 promotes enhanced cytotoxicity and carrier internalization by cancer cells and demonstrates the potential for intracellular drug delivery after exposure to lowered pH environment, typical of solid tumors.
