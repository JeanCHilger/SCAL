Plasma cross linked fibrin degradation products in pulmonary embolism. Plasma concentrations of cross linked fibrin degradation products, a marker of intravascular thrombosis and fibrinolysis, were measured in 495 patients with suspected pulmonary embolism referred for ventilation-perfusion lung scanning to determine whether concentrations are increased in pulmonary embolism and their potential use in diagnosis. Lung scans were described as normal (n = 66) or as showing a low (n = 292), indeterminate (n = 58), or high probability (n = 79) of pulmonary embolism. There was a difference between the mean levels of cross linked fibrin degradation products in each scan category: normal scans, 142 ng/ml low probability scans, 295 ng/ml
