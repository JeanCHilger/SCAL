Myeloperoxidase in the plasma and placenta of normal pregnant women and women with pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a heme protein produced and released by activated neutrophils and monocytes, and increased MPO is considered important in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Accumulating evidence suggests that preeclampsia (PE), idiopathic intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), and CVD share many similar metabolic disturbances, including an enhanced systemic inflammatory response and endothelial dysfunction. We hypothesized that MPO plays an important role in the development of PE and IUGR. Plasma samples were collected mid-gestation and at delivery from women with normal pregnancies (n = 40) and those who subsequently developed PE (n = 20), IUGR (n = 11) or both (PE + IUGR, n = 8). Placental samples were obtained immediately after delivery from 22 women with normal pregnancies, 19 women with PE, 14 women with IUGR, and 14 women with PE + IUGR. The MPO concentrations were measured using ELISA. Women with PE + IUGR had significantly higher plasma MPO before delivery than normal pregnant women. There was no difference in plasma levels at mid-gestation or the placental concentrations between women with normal pregnancies and those who developed PE, IUGR, or PE + IUGR. Using explants prepared from the placentas of 8 women with normal pregnancies and 8 women with PE, we found no difference in the levels of MPO in the tissue homogenates and culture media between these two groups of women. Together, these results indicate that increased maternal circulating MPO in women with PE + IUGR is likely a result of enhanced systemic inflammation caused by the established disease rather than a primary pathophysiological factor.
