Double transformation of a hematopoietic malignancy and severe associated thrombopathy. Case presentation and review of the literature. We present the case of a patient with a double transformation during the evolution of chronic hematopoietic malignancy - JAK2 positive chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm the first transformation had occurred previous to the presentation in our Department, but the second transformation was observed in evolution and it was into a rapidly evolving disease, followed by survival of less than one month. We underline the very poor prognosis -- overall survival of 2.5 years from initial presentation -- a much reduced survival for a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm, probably due also to multiple associated pathology. Also, the other interesting element of the case is related to the dysfunctional platelets -- hemorrhagic complication at increased platelet count, respectively thrombosis at platelet count under 20000/mmc.
