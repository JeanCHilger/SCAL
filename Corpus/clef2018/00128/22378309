Hormonal evaluation in premature ejaculation. Premature ejaculation (PE) is a frequently encountered sexual dysfunction in men. It significantly impairs quality of life of the affected male and his partner. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of hormonal factors in patients with PE.107 male patients aged between 26 and 64 years (mean 45.1 ± 10.36) who consulted our outpatient clinics with complaints of PE and 94 healthy males (48.1 ± 11.81 years) as a control group were included in the study.When mean serum hormone concentrations of both groups were compared, levels of prolactin and free T4 were found to be significantly higher in the PE group relative to the control group (p < 0.05). At least one of the hormonal parameters was abnormal in 36 cases (33.6%) with PE, compared to only 22 (23.4%) of the controls. The number of hyperprolactinemic cases was found to be significantly increased in the PE group (p < 0.05).We feel that during the evaluation of this problem, which affects great numbers of men and their partners throughout the world, consideration of potential effects of hormonal factors might be beneficial.
