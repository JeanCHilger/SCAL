The role of angiogenic, anti-angiogenic and vasoactive factors in pre-eclamptic African women: early- versus late-onset pre-eclampsia. The pathogenesis and aetiology of pre-eclampsia (PE) is still unclear. We investigated the role of angiogenic, antiangiogenic and vasoactive factors in black South African women with early- and late-onset PE. Serum soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1), soluble vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and placental growth factor (PlGF) levels were determined using the ELISA technique, and placental mRNA expression levels of sFlt-1, VEGF, PlGF and AT1 receptors were determined using real-time PCR. Serum sFlt-1 levels were significantly elevated and PlGF significantly reduced in early-onset PE compared to the normotensive group. Placental VEGF mRNA expression levels were significantly reduced in the late-onset preeclamptic group compared with the normotensives. The placental mRNA expression of AT1 receptor in the late-onset pre-eclamptic group was relatively raised compared to the normotensives, suggesting hypersensitivity to pressor agents. We believe that the excess of serum sFlt-1 and reduced VEGF and PlGF levels favour an anti-angiogenic state and endothelial dysfunction leading to PE, and that the aetiology and pathogenesis of early- and late-onset PE differ.
