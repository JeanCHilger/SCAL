Incidence and predictors of deep venous thrombosis after abdominal oncologic surgery: prospective Doppler ultrasound screening. Venous thromboembolism is a relatively rare but serious complication of abdominal surgery. This study evaluated the incidence and risk factors for the development of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) after abdominal oncologic surgery using color Doppler ultrasonography (DUS).This study enrolled 132 consecutive patients who underwent elective abdominal surgery for malignant tumors. Patients were investigated for DVT using DUS on postoperative day 7 Â± 2. Correlations between the incidence of DVT and clinicopathologic parameters and the postoperative course were evaluated.DVT was found in 15 patients (11.4%) using DUS. Clinically evident venous thromboembolism, including pulmonary embolism, was not found in these patients. The incidence of DVT was significantly higher in females (P=0.002), patients with a lower body mass index (P=0.008), and patients with a higher preoperative D-dimer level (P<0.0001).DUS is noninvasive and is useful for postoperative DVT screening. Thromboprophylaxis is essential in high-risk patients who have undergone abdominal oncologic surgery.
