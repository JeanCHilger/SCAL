Correlation analysis between plasma D-dimer levels and orthopedic trauma severity. The correlation between the plasma D-dimer level and deep vein thrombosis has not been conclusive in various studies. The aim of this research was to study the relationship between plasma D-dimer levels and the severity of orthopedic trauma by retrospective examination of orthopedic trauma cases.Clinically acute trauma and non-acute trauma patients were selected and their plasma D-dimer levels were measured. Plasma D-dimer levels in patients of these two groups were compared. The relationship between the plasma D-dimer level and the severity of the trauma was also studied.There were 548 cases in the acute trauma group and 501 cases in the non-acute trauma group. The levels of plasma D-dimer were significantly higher in the acute trauma group than in the non-acute trauma group (P < 0.01). In the acute trauma group, the correlation between the D-dimer level and the number of fractures was a positive linear correlation (r = 0.9532).Elevated plasma D-dimer is common in trauma patients. The D-dimer level and the number of fractures in the trauma patients are closely correlated. D-dimer is not only an indicator for the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolus, but also an indicator of the severity of trauma in acute trauma patients.
