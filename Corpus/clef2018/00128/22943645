Predictive factors of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension in patients with acute pulmonary thromboembolism. To evaluate the incidence and predictive factors of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) in patients with acute pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE).Clinical data of 104 patients with CT angiography-proven PTE were collected and Wells score, revised Geneva score and ECG score were calculated. Blood gas analysis, CK-MB and D-dimer values were analyzed. Heart chamber diameters and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) were assessed by echocardiography. Qanadli obstruction index and Mastora obstruction index were evaluated according to computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA). Patients were followed up by telephone or clinic visit to assess the WHO functional class and the incidence of CTEPH.During the 25.47Â±16.94 months (4 to 62 months) follow-up, 7 out of 104 patients were lost to follow-up and data from the remaining 95 patients were analyzed. The incidence of CTEPH was 14.4% (14/97). Baseline PASP, incidence of recurrent PTE, right atrium and right ventricle diameters and CK-MB were significantly higher in CTEPH group compared to non-CTEPH group (all P<0.05). Higher CK-MB (odds ratio: 8.3) and baseline PASP (odds ratio: 5.0 per 20 mm Hg increment) were independent predictive factors for CTEPH in this cohort.Higher CK-MB and baseline PASP values are independent predictive factors related to the development of CTEPH post acute pulmonary thromboembolism.
