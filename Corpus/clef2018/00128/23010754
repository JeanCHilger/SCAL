Pentraxin 3 as a new biomarker of peritoneal injury in peritoneal dialysis patients. It is well known that bioincompatible peritoneal dialysate plays a central role in the development of peritoneal fibrosis. Peritoneal inflammation continues even after the cessation of peritoneal dialysate stimulation. It is important to establish the definition of persistent inflammation in the peritoneal cavity at the cessation of peritoneal dialysis (PD). The objective of the present study was to determine whether pentraxin 3 (PTX3) in peritoneal effluent (PE) may be a new biomarker in PD patients. Serum, PE, and peritoneal specimens were obtained from 50 patients with end-stage kidney disease at Juntendo University Hospital. Samples of 19 patients were obtained at the initiation of PD and those of 31 patients at the cessation of PD. PTX3, high-sensitivity CRP, and MMP-2 and IL-6 were analyzed. An immunohistological examination using an anti-PTX3 antibody was performed. Expressions of PTX3 were observed in endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and mesothelial cells in the peritoneum. The PTX3 level in PE at the cessation of PD was significantly higher than that at the initiation of PD. Effluent PTX3 levels in patients with a history of peritonitis or a PD duration of more than 8 years were significantly higher than those in patients without peritonitis or patients with a PD duration of <8 years. The PTX3 level was significantly correlated with MMP-2 and IL-6 levels in PE, as well as the thickness of the submesothelial compact zone and the vasculopathy. It appears that PTX3 may be a new biomarker of peritoneal inflammation and progressive fibrosis.
