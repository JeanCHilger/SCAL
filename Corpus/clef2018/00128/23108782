Can detection of late-onset PE at triage by sflt-1 or PlGF be improved by the use of additional biomarkers? Accurate identification of preeclampsia (PE) at triage is essential to reduce maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. The use of maternal blood based biomarkers may facilitate the clinician's ability to assess high risk pregnancies at triage.A prospective cross-sectional study was performed to investigate the value of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1), soluble endoglin (sEng), placental growth factor (PlGF), sP-selectin, cell-free fetal DNA and total cell-free DNA in patients with late-onset PE versus gestational age-matched controls.The diagnosis of late-onset PE (n = 21) at triage was significantly improved by altered levels of sFlt-1, sEng, PlGF and cffDNA as compared with controls (n = 42). Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves [AUC, Standard error (SE)] for predicting PE were for marker measurements prior to the first stage of labor as follows: sFlt-1 0.97 (SE 0.02), sEng 0.91 (SE 0.04), PlGF 0.95 (SE 0.04), cell-free fetal DNA (DYS 14) 0.84 (SE 0.06), total cell-free DNA (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) 0.61 (SE 0.07), sP-selectin 0.51 (SE 0.07). The discrimination could be slightly improved by using the slt1-PlGF ratio: 0.98 (SE 0.02).The sFlt-1 is a useful tool for the detection of late-onset PE at triage. This can be slightly improved using a sFlt-1/PIGF ratio. The addition of other biomarkers did not improve screening performance for late-onset PE.
