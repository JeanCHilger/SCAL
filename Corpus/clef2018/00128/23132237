Percutaneous transluminal pulmonary angioplasty for the treatment of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension leads to pulmonary hypertension and right-sided heart failure. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of percutaneous transluminal pulmonary angioplasty (PTPA) for the treatment of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.Twenty-nine patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension underwent PTPA. One patient had a wiring perforation as a complication of PTPA and died 2 days after the procedure. In the remaining 28 patients, PTPA did not produce immediate hemodynamic improvement at the time of the procedure. However, after follow-up (6.0 ± 6.9 months), New York Heart Association functional classifications and levels of plasma B-type natriuretic peptide significantly improved (both P<0.01). Hemodynamic parameters also significantly improved (mean pulmonary arterial pressure, 45.3 ± 9.8 versus 31.8 ± 10.0 mm Hg cardiac output, 3.6 ± 1.2 versus 4.6 ± 1.7 L/min, baseline versus follow-up, respectivelyPTPA improved subjective symptoms and objective variables, including pulmonary hemodynamics. PTPA may be a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.URL: http://www.umin.ac.jp. Unique identifier: UMIN000001572.
