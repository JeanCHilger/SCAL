Clinical utility of natriuretic peptides in left ventricular failure. Left ventricular failure (LVF) is a clinical syndrome caused by abnormal systolic or diastolic function failing to meet the metabolic requirements of the body. It is important to diagnose and manage LVF in the earliest stages to prevent mortality and morbidity. This article extensively reviews the diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic utility of natriuretic peptides in LVF.
