The role and significance of microRNA in human cardiovascular disease and forensic science. microRNA (miRNA or miR) is a small single stranded non-coding RNA (21-25nt) that regulates gene expression in almost creatures. Currently, plenty of researches on how miRNA affects human cardiovascular disease have been reported. This review highlights recent findings about the role of miRNA in heart tissue and circulation correlated with human cardiovascular disease and explores the application of miRNA in sudden cardiac death in forensic science.
