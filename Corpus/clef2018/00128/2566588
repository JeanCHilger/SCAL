Characterization of southern African isolates of maize streak virus: typing of three isolates by restriction mapping. The genomic replicative form DNAs (RF-DNA) of three maize streak virus isolates (MSV-CT, MSV-PE, and MSV-SW) from widely separated locations in southern Africa were characterized by restriction endonuclease mapping in order to assess the feasibility of using the technique to determine genetic variability between isolates. The viruses were transmitted to and propagated in laboratory-grown maize by the leafhopper vector Cicadulina mbila (Naud√©). MSV-PE produced more severe symptoms than MSV-CT and MSV-SW the isolates were serologically identical in 'western' immunoblot tests, but distinct in 'sandwich' enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. RF-DNA of all three isolates was prepared from infected maize
