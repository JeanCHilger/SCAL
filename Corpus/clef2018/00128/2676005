Laboratory diagnosis of pulmonary embolism: value of increased levels of plasma D-dimer and thrombin--antithrombin III complexes. Plasma D-dimer (DD) and thrombin--antithrombin III complex (TAT) were measured with ELISAs in 99 patients investigated by 102 ventilation--perfusion lung scintigraphy because of suspected pulmonary embolism. High-probability lung scan was associated with increased DD (more than 500 ng/ml) and TAT (more than 4.1 ng/ml) levels (sensitivity of 100 and 70%, respectively). The corresponding figures of specificity were 81 and 42%. In the 56 patients with low-probability or indeterminate probability scans, 31 (55%) had DD concentrations of less than 500 ng/ml. These preliminary data suggest that a plasma DD concentration of less than 500 ng/ml might rule out the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in suspected patients with an inconclusive lung scanning.
