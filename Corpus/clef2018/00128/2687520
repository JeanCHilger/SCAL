A case of nephrotic syndrome associated with pulmonary infarction and renal vein thrombosis. (A review of literature). A case of nephrotic syndrome found by pulmonary infarction associated with renal vein thrombosis was reported. The renal biopsy showed the presence of membranous glomerulonephritis. The patient had the increase of serum level of the coagulation factor II, V, fibrinogen and FDP, and the level of urine FDP. These laboratory data suggested that the hyper coagulation state of his blood caused by nephrotic state, induced his multiple thromboembolism. We surveyed 47 case report abstracts of nephrotic syndrome patients having thromboembolism on the Japanese Journal of Nephrology published from 1974 to 1986. The histopathology of their renal biopsies showed the high incidence of membranous glomerulonephritis, followed by minimal change nephrotic syndrome and focal glomerular sclerosis. Renal vein thrombosis was the most common thromboembolism in the reports, followed by thrombosis of cerebral vessels, peripheral vessels and pulmonary artery. Some patients died of pulmonary infarction or myocardial infarction. These data showed that we must keep in mind of the possibility of thromboembolism in the treatment of nephrotic syndrome.
