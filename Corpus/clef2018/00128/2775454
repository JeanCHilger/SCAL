Identification of high molecular weight peptides in bovine adrenomedullary chromaffin granules using monoclonal antibodies to a preproenkephalin A fusion peptide. Two mouse monoclonal antibodies (PE-1 and PE-2) raised to a beta-galactosidase-preproenkephalin A(69-207) fusion peptide recognize pro-enkephalin A (pro-enk-A) peptides of 33-5 kDa isolated from bovine adrenal chromaffin granules. The preliminary characterization of the high molecular weight adrenomedullary pro-enk-A peptides recognized by PE-1 and PE-2 is described. The high molecular weight peptides were resolved after Sephadex G-50 chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) into three components (peaks I, II and III). Immunoblot analysis showed each HPLC peak to be heterogeneous. Peak I contained PE-1-and PE-2-immunoreactive peptides of 33, 29, 24 and 22 kDa peak II contained a peptide of 22 kDa recognized by PE-2, and peptides of 24 and 22 kDa recognized by PE-1
