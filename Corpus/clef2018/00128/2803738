Simultaneous analysis of lymphocyte markers using triple color markers. The introduction in flow cytometry of the new reagent Streptavidin Duochrome allows the simultaneous three color analysis of biological samples. Streptavidin Duochrome is a phycoerythrin-Texas red fluorochrome complex conjugated to the protein streptavidin. This novel complex exploits the principle fluorescence energy transfer when this reagent is used with FITC, PE and biotin-conjugated monoclonal antibodies three different emissions of fluorescence are possible simultaneously using an argon laser at 488 nm (FACScan Becton Dickinson). Using Paint-a-gate software which analyses samples and displays the three colors on a screen, antigen distribution on multiple cell populations is obtained. Single, double and triple labeled cells (up to seven combinations) are visualized and quantified quickly and easily. Using a panel of normal donors we have evaluated the following combinations: CD3/CD4/CD8 to visualize T lymphocytes and their subsets
