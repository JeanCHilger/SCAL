Severe pulmonary embolism disclosing a deficiency in protein C. A constitutional deficit in protein C is a rare disorder. Our report concerns a 35 year old non-smoking male, presenting with a past history of uncomplicated phlebitis of the lower limbs. In the course of a new episode of phlebitis, the patient presented with a severe pulmonary embolus treated by embolectomy under extracorporal circulation, with interruption of the inferior vena cava. The plasma level of protein C (Elisa technique) measured before treatment with antivitamin K was 40% (normal 70-140%). The absence of associated hepatic or haematological anomalies confirmed the constitutional character of the deficit. The immediate and subsequent progress turned out favourably on treatment with heparin, then anti-vitamin K.
