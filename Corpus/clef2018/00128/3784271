Sensitivity and specificity of hemostatic indices in the diagnosis of thromboembolism of the pulmonary artery in patients with cardiovascular diseases. Fifty-four patients with pulmonary arterial thromboembolism were investigated. Pulmonary embolism was associated with acute myocardial infarction in 16 cases and with congestive circulatory insufficiency in 38 cases of postinfarction and atherosclerotic cardiosclerosis. Clinical signs as well as electrocardiographic and roentgenographic data showed low sensitivity due to the severity of underlying disease and pre-existing electrocardiographic and roentgenographic changes. Hemostatic studies were highly sensitive, yet in most cases their specificity was low. The measurement of fibrinogen degradation product levels had diagnostic significance as the sensitivity and specificity of this test were fairly high.
