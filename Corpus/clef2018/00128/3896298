Serum crosslinked fibrin (XDP) and fibrinogen/fibrin degradation products (FDP) in disorders associated with activation of the coagulation or fibrinolytic systems. Soluble crosslinked fibrin derivatives (XDP) in serum were determined by enzyme immunoassay utilizing monoclonal antibodies and compared with serum fibrinogen/fibrin degradation products (FDP) assayed by conventional techniques. In healthy subjects and patients with miscellaneous disorders not usually associated with activation of the haemostasis mechanism, mean XDP levels were 45 and 70 ng/ml respectively. However, elevated levels of XDP occurred in conditions commonly associated with intravascular and possibly extravascular activation of the coagulation system. Markedly raised mean XDP values (677-6900 ng/ml) occurred in treated pulmonary embolism, disseminated neoplasia, severe inflammatory disorders and complicated postoperative states, and lesser but significant elevation (mean 150-400 ng/ml) in treated venous thrombosis, uneventful postsurgical states, localized neoplasia, liver disease and symptomatic arterial disease. Levels during initial streptokinase therapy (mean 24 000 ng/ml) fell tenfold as treatment was continued. The degree of XDP elevation over normal values was significantly higher than that of FDP in conditions with a propensity for venous thrombosis (post-operative states, disseminated neoplasia and inflammatory diseases) than in liver disease, localized neoplasia or patients receiving heparin therapy for venous thromboembolism.
