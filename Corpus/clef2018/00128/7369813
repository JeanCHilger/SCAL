Reticuloendothelial clearance of blood-borne particulates: relevance to experimental lung microembolization and vascular injury. The rapid increase in sheep lung vascular permeability observed during Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia may be due to embolization of the pulmonary microvasculature by bloodborne particulates. Since alterations in lung microvascular permeability during mild septicemia in sheep may reflect inefficient RES phagocytic clearance of bacteria as well as products of bacterial induced intravascular coagulation, the opsonic and phagocytic aspects of RES function in sheep (30-50 kg) were compared to other species. RES function was evaluated by both the clearance and relative organ uptake of gelatinized I(131) RE test lipid emulsion and gelatinized colloidal carbon. Immunoreactive opsonic a(2)SB glycoprotein levels were determined by electroimmunoassay. The phagocytic index for RES clearance of the gelatinized (500 mg/kg) test lipid in sheep was 0.019 +/- 0.002 corresponding to a half-time of 16.65 +/- 1.74 minutes. With colloidal carbon (64 mg/kg), the phagocytic index in sheep was 0.080 +/- 0.026, corresponding to a half-time of 6.16 +/- 1.99 minutes. The per cent of injected lipid emulsion (%ID) in major RE organs, on a total organ basis (TO), was: liver = 15.69 +/- 1.65% spleen = 2.09 +/- 0.78%. Localization in the lung = 31.39 +/- 6.2%. The per cent of carbon localized in major RE organs (%ID/TO) was: liver = 21.37 +/- 1.9%
