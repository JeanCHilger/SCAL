Characterization of the antigenic specificity of four different anti-(alpha 2-->8-linked polysialic acid) antibodies using lipid-conjugated oligo/polysialic acids. A rapid, sensitive, and facile method for screening and characterizing anti-polysialic acid (polySia) antibodies using lipid-conjugated oligo/polysialic acids (oligo/polySia) was developed, which is based on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Homooligo/polymers of alpha 2-->8-linked N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), N-glycoly-neuraminic acid, and 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-galacto-nononic acid (KDN) were conjugated with phosphatidylethanolamine dipalmitoyl (PE) by reductive amination to prepare neo-oligo/polysialoglycolipids (oligo/polySia-PE). Using this method, the anti-polySia equine antibody, H.46, bound to (-->8Neu5Ac alpha 2-->)n-PE, where n = 9 or more residues, a result in confirmation of previous binding studies using radiolabeled oligo/polyNeu5Ac. The antigenic specificity and sensitivity of two monoclonal anti-poly/oligoNeu5Ac antibodies (mAb.12E3 and mAb.5A5) and one anti-oligoKDN antibody (mAb.kdn8kdn), were also determined. mAb.12E3 could detect as little as 25 pg/well of oligo/polyNeu5Ac-PE, while 0.4 ng/well of oligo/polyNeu5Ac-PE to be detected. mAb.kdn8kdn detected as little as 12 ng/well of oligoKDN-PE. Using a series of oligo/polySia-PE with defined degrees of polymerization (DP), the minimum chain length for immunoreactivity of the anti-polySia antibodies was determined to be: DP 5 for mAb.12E3 DP 3 for mAb.5A5
