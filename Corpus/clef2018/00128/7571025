Soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and serum cytokines in melanoma patients treated with liposomes containing muramyl tripeptide. A soluble form of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) has been recently identified in patients with malignant melanoma. It has been demonstrated that inflammatory cytokines can modulate the cellular expression of ICAM-1 and the shedding of this molecule by cells. To our knowledge, few data exist on serum sICAM-1 levels in cancer patients treated with immunomodulators. Liposomes containing muramyl tripeptide (MLV MTP-PE) can activate monocytes from cancer patients in vitro and in vivo, making them cytotoxic such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6). The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the levels of sICAM-1 and their possible correlation with serum inflammatory cytokine levels in melanoma patients treated with MLV MTP-PE.The sera from 9 patients with metastatic melanoma treated with MLV MTP-PE, 4 mg i.v. twice a week for 12 weeks, were tested in ELISA system to detect sICAM-1, TNF-alpha, IL-6, Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) before, and 2 and 24 h after the 1st, 12th and 24th infusion of MLV MTP-PE.Baseline levels of sICAM-1 were elevated in all patients (median 540 ng/ml: range 400-1030 ng/ml). Twenty-four h after the 1st infusion of MLV MTP-PE, we observed 6 increases in sICAM-1 levels, 1 decrease and 2 stable values (median 720 ng/ml: range 410-1820 P = 0.060). Twenty-four h after the 12th infusion, sICAM-1 increased in 3 patients and did not change in 4 (median 790 ng/ml: range 495-1650 ng/mlbaseline levels of sICAM-1 were elevated in all patients and further increased during treatment only in patients with more aggressive disease. No correlation was found between sICAM-1 and inflammatory cytokines. It would therefore seem that in patients with advanced disease, higher levels and a progressive increase in sICAM-1 may be unfavorable prognostic factors.
