Application of a novel and rapid whole blood assay for D-dimer in patients with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism. To determine the clinical utility of a novel whole blood assay for D-dimer (SimpliRED) in patients with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism (PE).Prospective cohort.Eighty-six consecutive patients with clinically suspected PE.All patients had the SimpliRED D-dimer assay performed and underwent ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) lung scanning and bilateral impedance plethysmography (IPG) pulmonary angiography was performed in two patients. Patients were classified as: 1) PE-positiveThis study demonstrates that the SimpliRED D-dimer assay, which can be performed and interpreted at the bedside within five minutes, has potential clinical utility as an exclusionary test in patients with clinically suspected PE. The assay should be evaluated in large clinical management studies.
