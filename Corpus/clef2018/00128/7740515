Comparison of the efficacy of D-dimer, fibrin degradation products and prothrombin fragment 1+2 in clinically suspected deep venous thrombosis. The diagnostic efficacy of D-dimer, fibrin degradation products (FbDP) and prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F1+2) in patients with clinically suspected deep venous thrombosis (DVT) was investigated. 161 patients suspected of DVT were investigated. The diagnosis DVT was made in 58 patients using isotope leg scanning and ultrasonic duplex scanning. In all patients D-dimer, FbDP and F1+2 levels were determined using a latex method for D-dimer and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (EIA) for FbDP and F1+2. For the D-dimer latex assay sensitivity was 69% and specificity 92% (cut-off level 500 ng/ml). For the FbDP assay sensitivity was 100% and specificity 8% (cut-off level 250 ng/ml). For the F1+2 assay sensitivity was 100% and specificity 17% (cut-off level 0.3 nM). Specificity could not be improved by the combination of FbDP and F1+2. We conclude that in our population the use of the latex D-dimer assay, FbDP and F1+2 EIA's have no value as screening tests to rule out the diagnosis DVT in clinically suspected patients.
