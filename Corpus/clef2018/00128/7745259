Coagulation disorders after endoscopic resection of the prostate. Endoscopic resection of the prostate is a well defined surgical procedure. Nevertheless, certain coagulation disorders (hypercoagulability with risk of deep vein thrombosis, haemorrhage) can raise special problems. In patients not given heparin prophylaxis, the incidence of deep vein thrombosis is 10% in transurethral resections of the prostate (TURP). The risk is higher for cancer. Among the diagnostic tools (D-dimer assay, continuous Doppler, pulsed echo-Doppler, thermography, plethysmography, ...) ascending phlebography or pulmonary angiography in case of suspected pulmonary emboli remains the gold standard. Haemorrhage is rarely related to defribination but frequently to dilution coagulopathy favoured by high blood pressure, resorption of irrigation fluid, deficient haemostasis with loss of coagulation factors or massive transfusions. Only clinically patent coagulation disorders leading to haemorrhage should be treated. For dilution coagulopathies and diffuse intravascular coagulation, treatment is based on viro-inactive fresh plasma infusion. Aprotinine is the first choice in case of fibrinolysis.
