Monoclonal antibodies directed to the synthetic carbohydrate antigen Ley. Tetrasaccharide Fuc alpha 1-2Gal beta 1-4(Fuc alpha 1-3)GlcNAc is known as carbohydrate determinant of cancer- and AIDS-associated antigen Lewisy (Ley). Synthetic antigen to generate mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed to Ley was prepared and constructed as a spacer-armed tetrasaccharide coupled with lipophilized polymer, Ley-PAA-PE, where PAA is a 30-kD polyacrylamide and PE is phosphatidylethanolamine. An efficient immune response was provided by using Ley-PAA-PE adsorbed on Salmonella minnesota. Positive hybridomas were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using Ley-PAA as a coating agent. An inhibitory version of the same test system showed absolute specificity of two MAbs: only hapten Ley and Ley-PAA were strong inhibitors, in contrast to Leb, tri- and disaccharidic fragments of the mentioned tetrasaccharides, as well as their PAA-conjugates. MAbs obtained against synthetic antigen specifically stained the Ley (+) cell line A431.
