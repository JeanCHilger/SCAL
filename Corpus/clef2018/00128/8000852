Preformed antibody and complement rebound after plasma exchange: analysis of immunoglobulin isotypes and effect of splenectomy. Splenectomy (Sx) has been proposed to attenuate post-PE (plasma exchange) rebound of isoagglutinins and xenogenic (XG) antibody (Ab) in both ABO-incompatible allografts and discordant xenografts. This study analyses the qualitative nature and kinetics of serum immunoglobulins as well as complement resynthesis after PE in sham-operated (PE) and splenectomized (PE+Sx) syngeneic LOU/C rats non-PE sham-operated or splenectomized animals were used as controls. PE was performed in unanesthetized, unheparinized rats. Immunoglobulin isotypes and subclasses (IgM, IgG1, IgG2 alpha, IgG2b) of total circulating Ab were measured pre-PE and up to 21 days post-PE, using ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and specific mouse antirat monoclonal Ab. Antiguinea-pig (GP) XG Ab (IgM, IgG2a) serum levels were measured using cellular ELISA with cultured GP endothelial cells as targets. Sx alone significantly reduced XG IgM serum levels (p < 0.0001). Maximal rebound of total and XG IgM was observed on day 3 post-PE, reaching 674% and 187% of the pre-PE levels, respectively(1) Six alone significantly reduced XG IgM serum levels (2) early post-PE Ab rebound was mainly observed for IgM
