Incidence of antiphospholipid antibodies in patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. The incidence of antiphospholipid antibodies in patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) was studied. Antiphospholipid antibodies were measured in the sera of 93 patients (49 women, 44 men mean age 70 [+/- 21] years) with MGUS by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The phospholipids tested were cardiolipin (CL), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Positive results were defined as a value higher than the number of multiples of the mean per phospholipid, which included 76 of 80 (95%
