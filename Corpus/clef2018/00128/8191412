Increased plasma free gamma carboxyglutamic acid levels during deep vein thrombosis and intravascular disseminated coagulation. Gammacarboxyglutamic acid (gla) is a non essential amino acid synthesized in presence of vitamin K, predominantly found in coagulation and bone proteins. In 14 cases of deep vein thrombosis and in 11 cases of disseminated intravascular coagulation, compared to 19 normal subjects and 9 patients hospitalized for leg pain, free plasma gla levels were found significantly elevated (respectively 372 +/- 244 and 559 +/- 361 versus 146 +/- 34 and 120 +/- 40 pmol/mL). In six paired plasma and serum, gla levels were similar. These results suggest an involvement of blood coagulation in gla generation with need of a catabolism of the activated factors. A significant decrease was noticed during vitamin K antagonist therapy and liver disease, both instances in which the synthesis of gla containing coagulation factors is affected. During hepatocellular carcinoma with elevated desgamma carboxyprothrombin, gla was found normal, denying an global impairement of the vitamin K metabolism.
