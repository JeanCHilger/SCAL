Gestosis, thrombophilia and pulmonary embolism in a primipara with twin pregnancy. This is a case report on a course of gemini-pregnancy complicated by gestosis, recurrent submassive pulmonary embolism and discordant growth of the hypotrophic twins. It is concluded from this report that: 1. the AT-III-deficiency in gestosis can be caused by loss and consumption 2. due to decrease below a critical AT-III-level the coagulation-fibrinolysis system tends to decompensate, reflected in a disseminated intravascular coagulation and/or a pulmonary embolism. The tendency consists particularly in immobilisation and stasis
