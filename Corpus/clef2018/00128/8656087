Diagnosis of venous thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism by determination of d-dimers using ELISA. Review based on a study of 80 consecutive patients hospitalized in an emergency unit. The sensitivity and specificity of an ELISA method (Fibrinostika Fbdp Organon Teknika) for assay of D-dimers in the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism was studied in 80 consecutive patients seen at an emergency unit. Fifty-six of the patients presented clinical signs of deep vein thrombosis. Diagnosis was confirmed in 26 of the 56 patients with a D-dimer level above 370 ng/ml (sensitivity 92.3%) and 370 ng/ml for 13 of 30 patients with a negative venous ultrasound Doppler examination (specificity 43.3%). The positive predictive value was 58.5% and the negative predictive value was 87%. There was a significant difference in the level of D-dimers between distal and proximal deep vein thrombosis. In 40 cases with suspected pulmonary embolis, either alone or with suspected deep vein thrombosis, diagnosis was made in only 4 of 9 with a highly or intermediately probable ventilation/perfusion scan. D-dimer level was always above 3,000 ng/ml. Coupling the ELISA dimer test with noninvasive explorations improves negative predictive value but can also avoid invasive explorations (venography, pulmonary angiography) in certain patients. A D-dimer test as sensitive as the ELISA test and as rapid as the latex test remains to be described.
