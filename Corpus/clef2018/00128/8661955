Expression of inflammatory cytokine genes in vivo by human alveolar bone-derived polymorphonuclear leukocytes isolated from chronically inflamed sites of bone resorption. Alveolar bone-derived polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) were characterized for their ability to produce inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), IL-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), and IL-6 in vivo. Periapical exudates (PE) were collected from periapical lesions with chronic periapical periodontitis through root canals. Cells and noncellular supernatants were then isolated by centrifugation. The concentration of cytokines present in the noncellular supernatants were determined by ELISA. High concentrations of IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 were detected in PE, however, TNF alpha was not. PE contains predominantly PMNs ( > 95% of residing cells) with a few percent of lymphocytes and/or macrophages. These alveolar bone-derived PMNs were purified by the Ficoll-Hypaque gradient method and were analyzed for cytokine mRNA expression using the cytokine-specific reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Highly purified PMNs ( > 99.5%) isolated from PE expressed significant levels of mRNA for IL-alpha, IL-1 beta, and TNF alpha. IL-6 mRNA was not detected, although a high concentration of IL-6 was detected in supernatants of PE by ELISA. The IL-6 secretion in PE could be derived from macrophages, T lymphocytes, osteoblasts, or fibroblasts around periapical lesions. These data strongly suggest that human PMNs derived from alveolar bone can spontaneously produce IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and TNF alpha at sites of inflammation, and probably initiate inflammation and regulate augmentation of bone resorption in vivo.
