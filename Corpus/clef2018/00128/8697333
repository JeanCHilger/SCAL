Effects of bezafibrate on erythrocyte membrane phospholipids in alcohol-treated rats. Male rats of the Wistar strain were divided 4 groups, and give a liquid diet of control feed, bezafibrate (150 mg/kg), ethanol, and ethanol plus bezafibrate for 5 week. The effect of bezafibrate supplementation on rats fed ethanol was examined in terms of the fatty acid composition of the phospholipids in the erythrocyte membrane. In the phospholipids profiles of erythrocyte membranes, PI was significantly decreased. The decrease in PI caused by bezafibrate appeared to substantially affect the membrane and consequently lead to changes in the membrane anchor. In the fatty acid composition of the PC, C20: 4 was significantly decreased in the group receiving alcohol (p < 0.05) but increased in the groups receiving bezafibrate (p < 0.05). In the fatty acid composition of the PE, C16: 0 was significantly increased in the three groups when compared with the control, and C20: 4 was decreased in the alcohol group (p < 0.05). In the fatty acid of SM and PI, C20: 4 was decreased and C18: 0 increased in the alcohol group. In the PS, C14: 0 was increased in the alcohol group, and decreased in the alcohol plus bezafibrate group (p < 0.01). The levels of arachidonic acid in the total fatty acids that constituted the membrane phospholipids were decreased in the rats given ethanol (p < 0.05). However, arachidonic acid in the group of bezafibrate supplementation on rats fed ethanol were elevated in comparison with the alcohol group (p < 0.05). With decreasing arachidonic acid as a marker of alcohol tissue injury following chronic alcohol intake, the effects of bezafibrate supplementation appear to contribute to membrane fluidity by altering the biochemical flexibility of the membrane.
