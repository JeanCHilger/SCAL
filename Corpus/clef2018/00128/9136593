Study of hemostatic molecular marker. We examined hemostatic molecular markers in various thrombotic disorders. The efficacy of treatment in relation to the disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) score when the treatment was begun showed that greater efficacy was achieved in Pre-DIC than in DIC patients. The outcome was poorer with increasing DIC score, suggesting that early treatment is important. The sensitivity in some of molecular markers was high for both DIC and Pre-DIC. Receiver operating characteristic analysis suggest that soluble fibrin monomer level could be the most useful marker for the diagnosis of DIC. In examination of these markers in deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, acute myocardial infarction, and cerebral infarction, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and activated protein C-protein C inhibitor complex were useful marker for the diagnosis. Increased plasma GMP-140 was suggested to be the activation of platelets. The patients with high levels of plasma thrombomodulin (TM) considered to be a marker of vascular endothelial injuries became poor outcome. We will term these patients with high TM as systemic vascular endothelium injuries syndrome, and treat those by protecting the vascular endothelium.
