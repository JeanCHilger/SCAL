Altered immune response to staphylococcal antigens in long-lasting implanted mice. Staphylococcal infections constitute one of the main problems associated with clinical applications of various prosthetic medical devices (biomaterials). As the magnitude of the infection risk depends often on the duration of device installation, and the incidence of infections is higher in skin-penetrating devices, we studied some parameters of specific immune response to staphylococcal antigens in mice subcutaneously (s.c.) implanted for three months with heparinized polyethylene (H-PE). Three weeks before the evaluation of immune response, mice (implanted and non-implanted) were s.c. infected with 10(7) of Staphylococcus aureus Cowan 1. The proliferation of lymph node cells was determined on the basis of 3H-thymidine incorporation in 3-days cultures stimulated with: staphylococcal lipoteichoic acid (LTA), protein A (SpA), alpha-toxin, or with phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Moreover, the levels of specific antibodies to staphylococcal antigens were determined in serum samples (ELISA against: LTA, SpA, alpha-toxin). The data obtained indicate that long-lasting implantation caused evident changes in proliferative activity of lymphocytes and humoral response to staphylococcal antigens. It enhances alpha-toxin and LTA stimulated proliferation of lymph node lymphocytes in vitro. In contrast, H-PE-implanted animals demonstrated a significant decrease in the production of anti-SpA IgG2a and IgG2b and increase in the synthesis of anti-LTA IgG1 antibodies.
