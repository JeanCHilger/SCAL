Opinions regarding the diagnosis and management of venous thromboembolic disease. ACCP Consensus Committee on Pulmonary Embolism. American College of Chest Physicians. The purpose of this consensus report was to address clinically relevant questions related to the diagnosis and management of acute pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis.Physicians are often forced to make decisions about the diagnosis and management of pulmonary thromboembolism even though there are only limited data to guide them.We assessed the relevant literature regarding clinical trials according to levels of evidence. The data on which the opinions of the committee were made were sparse. The consensus opinions, therefore, were often based on experience or intuition, rather than firm data.Consensus opinions were given in regard to eight clinically relevant questions.We hope that the consensus opinions of this committee will assist others in making clinical decisions while we all await prospective investigations.
