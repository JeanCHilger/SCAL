Role of D-dimers in the diagnosis of thromboembolic disease. The presence of D-dimers in the bloodstream is secondary to fibrin formation and lysis. Because fibrin is the main component of a thrombus, deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism may be excluded with a predictive value of more than 95%, provided D-dimer plasma concentration is below a critical, assay-dependent cutoff. The D-dimer test is thus an ideal screening step in outpatients clinically suspected of venous thromboembolism. Only ELISA tests have been validated in clinical practice at present time for this indication, sensitivity of latex assays being insufficient.
