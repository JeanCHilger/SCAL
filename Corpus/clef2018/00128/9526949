Evaluation of the combination of a bedside D-dimer assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent soluble fibrin assay in patients with suspected venous thromboembolism. The objectives of the study were to determine whether the combination of a negative SimpliRED D-dimer assay and a low soluble fibrin result reliably excludes venous thromboembolism, and whether patients with proven venous thromboembolism and a normal SimpliRED D-dimer have evidence of impaired fibrinolysis. The study was a retrospective analysis of a cohort of 262 consecutive patients, 94 patients presenting with suspected deep venous thrombosis and 168 with suspected pulmonary embolism. Fifty-nine patients (22.5%) were classified as venous thromboembolism-positive, 27 with pulmonary embolism, and 32 with deep venous thrombosis. One hundred and fourteen patients (43.5%) had SimpliRED D-dimer and a soluble fibrin result of less than or equal to 2.0 microg/ml the negative predictive value was 98.2% (95% confidence interval: 93.8-99.8%), and the likelihood ratio was 0.06. Eight patients with proven venous thromboembolism had a negative SimpliRED D-dimer
