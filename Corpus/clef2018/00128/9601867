The role of D-dimer determination in clinical evaluation with pulmonary perfusion scintigraphy. The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is even in contemporary clinical practice problematical. Pulmonary angiography is used in our departments very little due to its invasive character. The method of choice for diagnosis remains therefore perfusion scintigraphy of the lungs, in this country frequently without ventilation scintigraphy as it is not available in the majority of our departments of nuclear medicine. In recent years in the diagnostic algorithms also assessment of D-dimers was started, i.e. assessment of products of fibrinolysis assessed by monoclonal antibodies. The authors tried to find out how many patients admitted to the medical department for diagnosis of pulmonary embolization may have a false positive diagnosis on the basis of pulmonary scintigraphy. During the period III/96 to V/96 a total of 18 patients from the medical clinic with suspected pulmonary embolism were examined where the value of D-dimers(latex test) was assessed and at the same time perfusion scintigraphy was performed. With regard to the highly negative predictive value of D-dimer assessment the authors focused their attention on patients with a suspect or positive lung scan (i.e. treated on account of pulmonary embolism) while D-dimers were negative. Of 13 patients with suspect or possible pulmonary embolism, as assessed by scintigraphy, four had negative dimers(30%). With regard to the 90% reported negative predictive value, based on the literature, thus three of these patients were unnecessarily admitted to hospital and treated. The authors assume that assessment of D-dimers should be part of the examination protocol due to its non-pretentious character and low price as compared with costs of hospitalization.
