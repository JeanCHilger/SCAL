Diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis by use of soluble necrosis factor receptor. The purpose of this clinical study was to find a relationship between soluble tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor, deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary emboli (PE). Clinical diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli is a major dilemma for the clinician. Most existing tests are technician dependent, are expensive, or require sophisticated equipment. Advances in molecular biology will permit investigation of the value of TNF receptor as a test for screening, diagnosis, and evolution of DVT and PE. Forty patients with diagnosis of DVT, documented by real-time ultrasound imaging, were the subject of this clinical study. Five cc of plasma from each patient was studied by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Elisa) for measurement of soluble TNF receptor. Significantly increased concentration of plasma-soluble TNF receptor was present in patients with DVT as opposed to normal individuals. There was a close relationship between plasma concentration of soluble TNF receptor and evaluation of the disease. In this preliminary clinical study, it appears that plasma measurement of soluble TNF receptor could be used as a clinical test for diagnosis of DVT and PE.
