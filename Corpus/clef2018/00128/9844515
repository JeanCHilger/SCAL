Deep venous thrombosis in pregnant women. The main risk factors for deep vein thrombosis in pregnancy and after delivery are preeclampsia, operative delivery, adiposity, prolonged bed rest, and haemostatic defects (antithrombin, protein C and protein S deficiencies), activated protein C resistance, lupus anticoagulant/antiphospholipid antibodies. Hyperhomocystinaemia is a general risk factor for deep vein thrombosis. The clinical diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis is difficult and must be confirmed by imaging techniques. Positive D-dimer has high sensitivity, but low specificity to detect acute thrombosis. Standard treatment is unfractionated heparin intravenously for 7-10 days, followed by subcutaneous injections. Anticoagulant treatment is prolonged for 6-12 weeks after delivery, usually with warfarin. During pregnancies associated with high risk of thrombosis, low molecular heparin prophylaxis is given during pregnancy and 6-12 weeks after delivery. Thrombosis in pregnancy must be followed by adequate investigation for an underlying thrombotic predisposition.
