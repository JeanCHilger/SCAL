Application of the ParaSight-F dipstick test for malaria diagnosis in a district control program. A rapid test for the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum infections based on the detection of histidine-rich-protein II, the ParaSight-F test, was evaluated after introduction in a district malaria control program in Uganda. Suspected treatment failures, pregnant women and infants with clinical malaria and general fever cases were tested at health facilities in malaria hypo-, meso- and holoendemic areas. A total of 1326 tests were carried out by health unit staff, cross read by experienced laboratory staff and results compared with thick film microscopy as the standard. Rater agreement in reading the dipstick result between health unit staff and laboratory staff was high, kappa index 0.94 (0.88-0.99). Sensitivity was 99.6% (99.0-100) for parasite densities above 500/microl, 98.6% (97.7-99.6) for densities above 50/microl and 22.2% (8.6-42.3) for densities below 10/microl. With the applied testing strategies no differences were found between endemicity levels or patient categories. Specificity was 86.2% (83.3-88.8) overall, but significantly higher in general fever cases (92.7%) compared to the other patient groups (84.3%, P=0.009). At the given prevalences positive predictive values (ppv) were above 80% and negative predictive values (npv) above 90% in all cases except in pregnant women (ppv: 77.8%). We conclude that in certain situations this test is an alternative to microscopy to improve diagnostic facilities for case management in malaria control programs in endemic African countries.
