Contribution of noninvasive evaluation to the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in hospitalized patients. The effectiveness of new diagnostic tools for suspected pulmonary embolism (PE), such as clinical probability assessment, plasma D-dimer (DD) measurement and lower limb venous compression ultrasonography (US), has not been specifically studied in patients with a suspected PE occurring during hospital stay. This study applied a sequential, decision analysis-based strategy adding these instruments to a ventilation/perfusion lung scan in a cohort of 114 consecutive inpatients clinically suspected of PE in order to establish in how many patients a pulmonary angiogram could thereby be avoided. A definitive diagnosis could be established by the noninvasive protocol in 61% of these patients: normal/near-normal lung scan, 14% high probability lung scan, 19%
