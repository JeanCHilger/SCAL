Diagnosis of pulmonary embolism by use of urinary TNF alpha and its soluble TNF receptor I. The purpose of this clinical study was to determine the concentration of soluble tumor necrosis factor in urine of patients with pulmonary embolism (PE), verses voluntary control individuals. Sixteen patients (ages 24 to 74 years) with diagnosis of PE, documented by ventilation perfusion scan or pulmonary angiogram, were the subjects of this study. Ten cc of urine was obtained from each patient and subjected to a solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay thus determining the soluble tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor I (R I) and TNF alpha levels in these samples. In this pilot study of PE cases, a statistically significant elevation in urinary levels of TNF alpha and soluble TNF R I was demonstrated in PE patients. The average urinary soluble TNF R I in normal subjects was 1,029 pg/mL and in PE patients the average TNF R I was 3,734.4 pg/mL. The clinical diagnosis of PE is a challenging problem for the physician. Late diagnosis and delayed management of this condition could be associated with massive PE. Although pulmonary angiography is the gold standard for diagnosis of PE, it requires expensive equipment, trained radiologists, and the patient could be at risk of sensitivity to contrast agents.
