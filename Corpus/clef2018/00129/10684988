Protected Trypanosoma cruzi infection in rats born to mothers receiving interferon-gamma during gestation is associated with a decreased intramacrophage parasite growth and preferential synthesis of specific IgG2b antibodies. We demonstrated that administration of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) to pregnant rats conferred partial resistance in their offspring to further challenge with Trypanosoma cruzi. Because of the effects of IFN-gamma on macrophage activation and immunoglobulin isotype selection, offspring were now studied to ascertain whether this intervention modifies the in vitro replication of T. cruzi and nitric oxide (NO) production by peritoneal macrophages (PE), together with the anti-T. cruzi IgG isotypes. To evaluate the possibility of a detrimental effect of IFN-gamma, serum levels of anti-sulphatide autoantibodies were also investigated. Offspring were born to mothers undergoing one of the following procedures during gestation: treatment with recombinant rat IFN-gamma, 50,000 IU/rat, five times/week for 3 weeks, which was started on the day of mating infection with 10(6) trypomastigotes of T. cruzi at 7, 14, and 21 days after mating plus IFN-gamma treatment as given to the former group
