The diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum infection in Gambian children, by field staff using the rapid, manual, ParaSight-F test. A rapid immunodiagnostic test for Plasmodium falciparum, the ParaSight-F test, was evaluated in the diagnosis of malaria in 139 children with uncomplicated malaria, who presented at the Medical Research Council's clinic at Basse in Upper River division, The Gambia. The aim was to evaluate the performance and usefulness of the test as a diagnostic method in a malaria-endemic area, when performed by a field worker. Compared with microscopy, the test had a sensitivity of 96.5%, a specificity of 90.5%, a negative predictive value of 94.2% and a positive predictive value of 94.3%. Because of its sensitivity, specificity and simplicity, the ParaSight-F test will be of value in situations where microscopy is not possible.
