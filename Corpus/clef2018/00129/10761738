Epidemiologic tools for malaria surveillance in an urban setting of low endemicity along the Colombian Pacific coast. An evaluation of 3 different methods for malaria diagnosis was carried out in an urban area of low endemicity on the Pacific coast of Colombia. Samples were collected from 833 symptomatic patients at a malaria clinic and examined by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), quantitative buffy coat (QBC Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) method, and the traditional thick blood smear. The prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum malaria was 5.88% by thick blood smear, 7.34% by the QBC method, and 21.87% by PCR. The agreement between microscopists was 99.5%. The agreement between the QBC method and thick blood smear was 96.13% (n = 745). Samples positive by PCR but negative by thick blood smear or conversely negative by PCR and positive by thick blood smear were usually of low-level parasitemias. All 3 methods showed agreement in 76.3% of the samples. Sixty-nine (18.8%) samples were positive by PCR but negative by the other 2 methods. Ten samples were positive by both the QBC method and thick blood smear but negative by PCR
