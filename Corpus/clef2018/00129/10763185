Imported malaria in Moselle: 75 cases in three years. Imported malaria frequency is increasing in France. Moselle, a north-east French county, with high concentration of servicemen going in endemic areas, follows the same trend.Clinical, epidemiological aspects and treatment of all malaria attacks diagnosed over 3 years (from 1st january 1996 to 31st january 1999) were studied. Data pertaining to antimalaria prophylaxis and the reasons for prophylaxis failure were analyzed.Seventy-five patients developed a paroxysmal episode of malaria. No severe malaria and no death were noted. Ninety-six percent of the patients came from Africa (96%), 64% of them coming from western Africa (Ivory coast, Senegal, and Togo). Plasmodium falciparum was responsible for 90% of the cases. Giemsa staining, quantitative buffy coat diagnosis system and parasight rapid dipstick antigen capture assay help guide diagnosis. Halofantrine (64%) and quinine (28.6%) were used as curative treatment. Investigation about prophylactic means showed than 37.9% of interviewed patients did not comply with the preventive treatment. The primary prophylaxis (avoiding bites) was in existent or badly done.Although the best choice for chemoprophylaxis is still debated, travelers going to endemic areas should be aware of the risks for malaria and persuaded to take a preventive treatment, even though its efficacy may not be complete. They also should wear insecticide-treated clothes in order to decrease the number of potentially infective mosquito bites.
