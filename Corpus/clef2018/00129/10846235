Diagnosis of malaria in non-endemic countries : value, limitations and complementarity of existing methods. The biological diagnosis of malaria is urgent to avoid rapid and fatal outcome. Every year in France, 5,000 imported malaria cases are observed. Thin stained blood smear microscopical examination remains the reference method of diagnosis however its performance is linked to the professional competence of the biologists. Thus easier methods have been developed (QBC test). Some of them, limited to the diagnosis of malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum do not require highly skilled personal to perform or interpret (antigen detection on dipsticks, tests Parasight or cardboard, ICT Malaria Pf), but limitations and errors occurred. These different tests must be complementary methods of traditional diagnosis. In association with microscopical examinations, they provide rapid and efficient diagnosis of malaria in non-endemic areas. Relying on our experience, the best association is: QBC + thin blood smear and depending of results antigen detection (ParaSight F, ICT Malaria Pf).
