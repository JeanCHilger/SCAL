Inability of serial fibrin monomer measurements to predict or exclude deep venous thrombosis in asymptomatic patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. Fibrin monomer (FM) is a highly sensitive marker of venous thromboembolism and can be used to rule out deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism in symptomatic outpatients. The aim of the study was to investigate the usefulness of serial fibrin monomer determinations to predict or rule out DVT after total knee arthroplasty in asymptomatic patients. One hundred and thirty consecutive patients underwent total knee replacement. Blood samples were obtained in 104 of them the day before, at days 1, 3, 6 after surgery and at the day of phlebography. Phlebography was performed in all these patients between days 8 and 12 after surgery. There were 44 DVT (44/104, 42%). As compared with the patients without DVT, FM mean levels were 2 and 1.5 times higher in the DVT group at day 3 (P < 0.001) and day 6 (P < 0.01), respectively. However, no useful cut-off values for DVT prediction or exclusion could be determined due to the scattering of the values. Therefore, despite differences between patients with or without DVT, serial FM determinations are of no value for predicting or ruling out DVT in individual patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty.
