Anti-phosphatidylethanolamine (aPE) antibodies: a survey. Reports of anti-phosphatidylethanolamine antibodies (aPE) with similar or identical pathogenic associations as those described for anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-phosphatidylserine (aPS) are found in the literature. In some instances, aPE is the sole antiphospholipid antibody (aPL) observed. Lupus anticoagulant antibodies (LA) appear to represent a subset of aPE as hexagonal phase PE can specifically inhibit the LA ability to prolong clotting times. As documented for aPL to the negatively charged phospholipids (PL), plasma proteins have been implicated for a positive aPE signal in the ELISA. Other aPE appear independent of known PE-binding plasma proteins. Among the described PE-binding proteins are high and low molecular weight kininogens (HMWK and LMWK) and the HMWK-binding proteins, factor XI and prekallikrein. Recently prothrombin has been added to this list. The reports of aPE published since 1986 are reviewed and discussed in this presentation.
