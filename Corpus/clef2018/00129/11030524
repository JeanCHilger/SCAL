Changes of hemostatic molecular markers after gynecological surgery. The authors evaluated the hemostatic abnormalities occurring in the postoperative period of eight patients with malignant tumors and compared them with those occurring in the postoperative period of eight patients with benign tumors. Two of the patients with malignant tumor presented pulmonary embolism after operation. Plasma fibrinogen and fibrin degradation product levels in patients with malignant tumors were already high before operation and further increased significantly after operation. The plasma levels of D-dimer, thrombin-antithrombin complex, and free-tissue factor pathway inhibitor were increased in both groups after operation, but they were higher in patients with malignant tumors than in patients with benign tumors. The plasma levels of protein C and antithrombin were significantly decreased in both groups after operation. but they were significantly lower in patients with malignant tumors than in those with benign tumors. The decreased activity of protein C or antithrombin may be not only a risk factor of thrombotic disease, such as pulmonary embolism, but also the cause of thrombosis. In patients with malignant tumors, the operation time was significantly longer than that in patients with benign tumors. This long operative period might cause vascular endothelial cell injury which is reflected by the plasma levels of free-tissue factor pathway inhibitor, antithrombin, and protein C.
