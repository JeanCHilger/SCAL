Epidemic typhus in tropical Africa. A reemerging disease that is severe but curable. In tropical regions of Africa, frequently subject to social and political upheavals, there is an ever-present threat of typhus epidemics, as shown by the recent typhus outbreak in Burundi in 1997. Epidemic typhus should be systematically suspected in certain epidemiological conditions: famine, war, high-density populations (refugee camps, prisons), the presence of body louse in the clothing, and in the presence of certain clinical findings: severe infectious syndrome (temperature above 38 C), severe pain and muscle weakness, with coughing and severe neurological signs. The rapid diagnosis and treatment of typhus are essential. The prognosis has improved, thanks to the specific antibiotics that are currently available, particularly doxycycline, prescribed as a single oral dose of 200 mg for adults or of 100 mg for children. However, the prognosis still depends to a large extent on the speed of diagnosis. Typhus epidemics could be effectively predicted and limited if the measures for control of the body louse recommended by the World Health Organization were applied in the areas with the most favorable epidemiological conditions.
