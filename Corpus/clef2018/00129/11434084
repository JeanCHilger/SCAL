Usefulness of measuring levels of d-dimer for diagnosis of hospital venous thromboembolism. D-dimer measurement with highly sensitive tests seems useful to rule out pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). However, nonspecific increase in d-dimer is common among inpatients. The aim of our study was to check: 1) whether the frequency of normal DD level in inpatients justifies its assessment as a part of diagnostic strategy for VTE, 2) whether tests that we are using are sensitive enough to exclude PE and DVT. In 27 (47%) out of 58 hospitalised patients evaluated by ultrafast ELISA (VIDAS bioMerieux), but in none of 20/58 patients with confirmed VTE, DD-level was found normal. In 35 of those patients DD was measured also with microlatex tests--Tinaquant and BC d-dimer. In 14/35 patients imaging test confirmed VTE. Sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value (NPV) respectively were following: VIDAS: 100%, 80%, 100%, Tinaquant: 100%, 48%, 100%, BC d-dimer: 29%, 90%, 70%. Our results suggest that: 1) the relatively high frequency of normal DD-level among inpatients justifies its use in diagnostic strategies involving hospitalised patients, 2) negative VIDAS test confirms its as reliability for excluding VTE while 3) high sensitivity found for Tinaquant test encourages further prospective studies, 4) sensitivity of BC d-dimer is too low to be useful for excluding VTE.
