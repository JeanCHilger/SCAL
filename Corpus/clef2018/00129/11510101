A case of acute pulmonary embolism associated with squatting. The patient was a 69-year-old man with a 3-year history of diabetes mellitus accompanied by cerebral infarction and arteriosclerosis obliterans of the lower extremities. After squatting to clean a car, the patient began to experience dyspnea. A blood gas analysis was performed upon admission, and the patient's PaCO2 and PaO2 levels were found to be low. Examination of a blood sample revealed elevated FDP, FDP-D dimer and platelet factor 4 levels. A perfusion lung scan showed multiple defects in both lungs, but no abnormal findings were detected on a ventilation scan. A pulmonary angiogram showed an interrupted blood flow in branches A9 + 10 of the left pulmonary artery. Accordingly, a pulmonary embolism was diagnosed. Squatting may have caused a partial obstruction of the venous return from the lower extremities by compression of the inguinal region and may have been a predisposing cause of the thrombosis. To our knowledge, such cases of pulmonary embolism triggered by the act of squatting are very rare.
