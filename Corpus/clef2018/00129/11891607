Gamma-interferon and soluble interleukin 2 receptor in tuberculous pleural effusion. To analysis the difference between systemic and local pleural T cell response in pulmonary tuberculosis, we analyzed interferon (IFN)-gamma and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) culture supernatants and in pleural effusion (PE). We also investigated the association of pleural INF-gamma and sIL-2R levels with development of residual pleural thickening (RPT). The subjects in this study included patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis with or without PE (n = 46), those with nontuberculous PE (n = 32), and healthy tuberculin reactors (n = 20). Measurement of IFN-gamma and sIL-2R were made by ELISA. In pulmonary tuberculosis, IFN-gamma and sIL-2R concentrations in PBMC culture supernatants were lower than those of healthy tuberculin reactors (IFN-gamma 258.4 +/-111.5 pg/mL versus 2792.5 +/-633.2 pg/mL, sIL-2R
