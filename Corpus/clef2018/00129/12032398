Evaluation of a new automated quantitative d-dimer, Advanced D-Dimer, in patients suspected of venous thromboembolism. The objective of our study was to evaluate the performance characteristics of a new automated d-dimer, the Advanced D-Dimer (Dade Behring Inc., Deerfield, IL) for use in the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE). To do this we compared the Advanced D-Dimer to existing d-dimer methods using established target cut-off values in patients suspected of VTE who were to undergo definitive radiographic studies for VTE. We studied hospitalized patients and outpatients who were suspected of having VTE and who had whole blood d-dimer performed. The patients who underwent a diagnostic study for VTE had their D-dimer results used to determine sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive values. There was relatively poor correlation between the Advanced D-Dimer and D-Dimer Gold (r = 0.63 t-test: P < 0.005) and Asserachrome D-Di (r = 0.58
