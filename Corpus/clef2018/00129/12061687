Superficial thrombophlebitis of the lower limbs in patients with varicose veins. This study reviews 51 consecutive patients with superficial thrombophlebitis (STP) among 710 patients treated for varicose veins in our department. Methods. An assessment was made of various factors involved.Of these 51 patients, 21 (41.1%) had systemic disorders, including 4 (7.8%) with malignant diseases. Six patients (11.8%) had deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and five (9.8%) had pulmonary embolism (PE). All of the patients with DVT and/or PE had a thrombus in either the greater saphenous vein or the lesser saphenous vein however, none of the patients with STP and a thrombus in the distal saphenous branch had either DVT or PE. The levels of coagulofibrinolytic markers such as fibrin degradation product-D dimer, plasmin alpha plasmin inhibitor complex, and thrombin antithrombin III complex were elevated in patients with STP or DVT, compared with those with varicose veins only. The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) was also elevated in the patients with STP or DVT. These findings indicate that STP is not necessarily a localized disease, but may be a symptom of systemic disease. In addition to duplex scanning, the measurement of coagulofibrinolytic markers as well as CRP may be useful for detecting STP and/ or DVT prior to the treatment of varicose veins.
