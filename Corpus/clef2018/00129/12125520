Serological appraisal of malaria status in tribal area of Orissa, India. A cross-sectional seroepidemiological study conducted in 173 tribal residents (including all age groups) from three villages of Sundergarh district of Orissa using ELISA as a tool revealed high levels of antibody titres against both AR1 and Pf antigens. The mean +/- S.D. ELISA O.D. obtained for AR1 were 0.73 +/- 0.2, 1.037 +/- 0.196, 1.05 +/- 0.42 and for Pf, 0.70 +/- 0.2, 1.0 +/- 0.28, 0.94 +/- 0.4 respectively for Badramoli, Jharbeda and Boneikela population. Parasitological results showed high incidence of malaria in < 5 years age group in Badramoli and Boneikela villages when compared to other age groups. An. fluviatilis was found to be the principle malaria vector as found in the HBI results. High ELISA O.D. and high equivalent transmission index (ETI) indicate a high malaria transmission in the area. Seroepidemiological studies could be used for effective surveillance and stratification of endemicity in a given area which can help in executing intervention strategy for malaria control.
