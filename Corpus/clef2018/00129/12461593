Rapid immunochromatographic malarial antigen detection unreliable for detecting Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium ovale. In order to determine the reliability of two commercial tests for the rapid detection of plasmodial antigen in cases of infection with Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium malariae, the products were evaluated in four centers and a search of the relevant literature was performed. The results of the present and previous studies were compared. With overall sensitivities ranging between 18.8% and 47.6% for Plasmodium malariae and between 20% and 31.3% for Plasmodium ovale, it is evident that neither test is reliable for the detection of Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium malariae infections.
