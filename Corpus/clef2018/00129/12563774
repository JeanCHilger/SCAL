Evaluation of immunochromatographic test in the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. To evaluate the effectiveness of immunochromatographic test(ICT) in detecting Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax in malaria endemic areas.ICT was used to detect P. falciparum and P. vivax among patients with fever in the outpatient clinics by comparason with thick blood smear method.The sensitivity of ICT to detect P. falciparum and P. vivax was 96.7% and 90.4%, respectively. The specificity of ICT was 98.6%, and the coincidence rate was 94.7%. There is no cross reaction between P. falciparum and P. vivax.ICT could detect P. falciparum and P. vivax simutaneously, being more rapid and simple than blood smear method.
