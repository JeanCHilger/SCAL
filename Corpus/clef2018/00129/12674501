MSP-1 malaria pseudopeptide analogs: biological and immunological significance and three-dimensional structure. Merozoite Surface Protein-1 (MSP-1) has been considered as a malaria vaccine candidate. It is processed during the Plasmodium falciparum invasion process of red blood cells (RBCs). A conserved MSP-1 C-terminal peptide was identified as a high-activity erythrocyte-binding peptide (HAEBP) termed 1585. Since conserved HAEBPs are neither antigenic nor immunogenic we decided to assess the significance of a single peptide bond replacement in 1585. Thus, two pseudopeptides were obtained by introducing a Y[CH2-NH] reduced amide isoster into the 1585 critical binding motif. The pseudopeptides bound to different HLA-DR alleles, suggesting that backbone modifications affect MHC-II binding patterns. Pseudopeptide-antibodies inhibit in vitro parasite RBC invasion by recognizing MSP-1. Each pseudopeptide-induced antibody shows distinct recognition patterns. 1H-NMR studies demonstrated that isoster bonds modulate the pseudopeptides' structure and thus their immunological properties, therefore representing a possible subunit malaria vaccine component.
