D-dimer and its relationship to fibrinogen/fibrin degradation products (FDPs) in disorders associated with activation of coagulation or fibrinolytic systems. Levels of D-dimer and fibrinogen/fibrin degradation products (FDPs) are significantly elevated in patients with deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or other complications. The diagnosis of these disorders can be difficult, time-consuming, and expensive. Assays for the detection of FDPs and D-dimer are used in many laboratories to investigate these disorders. The aim of this study was to compare plasma D-dimer levels obtained by the immuno-turdimetric method (Liatest D-Dimer Diagnostica Stago, Asni√®res, France) with plasma FDPs were measured by latex agglutination to investigate the relationship between these parameters. These immunoassays were tested in 144 blood samples from patients with suspected disorders associated with activation of coagulation or fibrinolytic systems. D-dimer and FDPs assays were performed in plasma samples by the use of Liatest D-dimer and plasma FDPs (Diagnostica Stago), respectively. Patients were divided into four groups according to plasma D-dimer levels. In group 1, 47.4% had negative FDPs and 52.6% had positive FDPs. In group 2, 15.4% had negative FDPs and 84.6% had positive FDPs. In group 3, 10.3% had negative FDPs and 89.7% had positive FDPs. All of the patients in group 4 had positive FDPs. It was shown that plasma D-dimer levels measured by Liatest D-dimer have a relation to FDP levels measured by latex agglutination.
