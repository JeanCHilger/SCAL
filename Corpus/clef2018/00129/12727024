Predominant cell-mediated immunity in the oral mucosa: gene gun-based vaccination against infectious diseases. Direct immunization via epithelial surfaces has been considered for many vaccine approaches, including DNA vaccines. It remains to be determined, however, which body site is suitable for genetic vaccination.To characterize the effects of the oral mucosa-mediated genetic vaccination, we compared antigen-specific immune responses of the oral mucosal DNA vaccine to the flank skin vaccination against influenza virus and malaria parasite.DNA vaccines against the influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) hemagglutinin and the malaria Plasmodium berghei circumsporozoite protein were administered respectively three times at 3-week intervals into the oral mucosa, skin, or liver of hamsters. The effects of their vaccine were evaluated by antigen-specific antibody production and cell-mediated killing activity. Furthermore, the in vivo malaria challenge test was also performed after the vaccination.Significant specific antibody production was not observed in each case, but interferon-gamma production and cell-mediated killing activity were strongly induced in splenic lymphocytes from hamsters with the oral vaccination. The in vivo malaria challenge after the oral mucosal vaccination significantly delayed the blood-appearance day of the parasites in comparison with other immunization sites (P<0.05).These results suggest that gene immunization via the oral mucosa may induce cell-mediated immunity more efficiently than via the skin or liver, and that the oral mucosa may be one of the most suitable tissues for gene gun-based DNA vaccination against infectious diseases.
