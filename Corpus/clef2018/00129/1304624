Use of dengue blot in dengue diagnosis: the Malaysian experience. Dengue fever/Dengue haemorrhagic fever (DF/DHF) has been a public health problem in Malaysia with an endemic level of about 7 per 100,000 population per year. In 1990, Malaysia experienced its most severe outbreak of DF/DHF with a record total of 5,590 cases referred to the Division of Virology, Institute for Medical Research (IMR). Of these, 1,880 were confirmed serologically to be DF/DHF. The conventional serological procedure, the Haemagglutination Inhibition (HI) test, for the diagnosis of DF/DHF is cumbersome and causes delay in diagnosis. Another problem associated with the HI test has been that it has often been difficult to obtain a second convalescent serum sample for an accurate diagnosis. This has raised an urgent need to establish a "rapid" test for diagnosis of DF/DHF. As such the authors recently carried out an evaluation of a newly available commercial rapid test, namely, the Dengue Blot Assay (Diagnostic Biotechnology Singapore Pte Ltd). The test is intended for use in laboratory confirmation of dengue virus infection. The evaluation was to determine if the test could be utilised as a routine laboratory test and to establish its sensitivity and specificity. Over 400 samples were tested against the Dengue Blot Assay. Results were checked against an in-house Dengue IgM ELISA and HI assay. Preliminary results indicate that the sensitivity and specificity of the Dengue Blot is satisfactory. Our results also indicate that the Dengue Blot has a useful role to play in a routine laboratory especially since it provides rapid results on single serum samples thereby reducing the workload in a busy diagnostic laboratory.
