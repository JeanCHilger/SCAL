Human IgG responses against the N-terminal region of the Merozoite Surface Protein 1 of Plasmodium vivax. The complete primary structure of the gene encoding the Merozoite Surface Protein 1 of Plasmodium vivax (PvMSP-1) revealed the existence of interspecies conserved regions among the analogous proteins of other Plasmodia species. Here, three DNA recombinant clones expressing 50, 200 and 500 amino acids from the N-terminal region of the PvMSP-1 protein were used on ELISA and protein immunoblotting assays to look at the IgG antibody responses of malaria patients from the Brazilian amazon region of Rond√¥nia. The results showed the existence of P. vivax and P. falciparum IgG antibodies directed against PvMSP-1 antigenic determinants expressed in the clones containing the first 200 and the following 500 amino acids of the molecule, but not within the one expressing the most N-terminal 50 amino acids. Interestingly, there was no correlation between the levels of these IgG antibodies and the previous number of malaria infections.
