Evaluation of plasma D-dimer in the diagnosis and in the course of fibrinolytic therapy of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Blood samples were obtained from patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) after angiographic confirmation as well as during fibrinolytic therapy with streptokinase. Plasma cross-linked fibrin degradation products were measured by a quantitative enzyme-linked immunoassay that recognizes the D-Dimer epitope. 24 patients with PE showed elevated D-Dimer levels (median 25%-, 75%-quartile) (3,250 ng/ml
