Field evaluation of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for estimating the sporozoite rate in Anopheles albimanus. We have verified for specimens of Anopheles albimanus that an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) used to assess Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum sporozoite antigen rates gives results comparable to the salivary gland dissection method for estimating sporozoite rates. For 14,150 adults of An. albimanus, captured at five locations in Guatemala, we report sporozoite antigen rates of 0.03-0.57%, which correlate with the malaria prevalences at the study sites. We also present data that suggest that specimens of An. albimanus for the ELISA can be obtained more efficiently by cattle corral collections than by the human bait capture method.
