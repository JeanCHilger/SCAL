Seroepidemiologic studies of humoral immune response to the Plasmodium falciparum antigens in Thailand. We have investigated seroreactivity against Plasmodium falciparum crude parasite antigens, the P. falciparum ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen (Pf155/RESA), as well as against two synthetic peptides (EENV)6 and (EENVEHDA)3 that represent important epitopes of Pf155/RESA. The study population consisted of 421 children and adult Thais living in an area with moderate malaria transmission. We related these serologic findings to some important epidemiologic baseline data collected in the study area. The parasite rate in study subjects was 18.76%. Sixty-two percent were seropositive to crude P. falciparum antigens, 30.3% to the Pf155/RESA antigen, 23.05% to (EENV)6, and 20.17% to (EENVEHDA)3. Antibody responses to crude P. falciparum antigens and to Pf155/RESA were age dependent and increased with exposure. There was evidence that Pf155/RESA antibodies might play a role in protective immunity in this population. Since Pf155/RESA is a potential vaccine candidate antigen, the information obtained from these field studies will provide some seroepidemiologic baseline data for subsequent vaccine trials.
