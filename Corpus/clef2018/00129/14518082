D-dimers in the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis. D-dimers (D-d) are degeneration products of fibrin. According to some recommendations (Lee et al., Ann Rev Med, 2002 53: 15-33) the vein thromboembolism may be excluded by the determination of D-dimers level especially when the probability of diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis is less strong. The determination of D-dimers with made possible was the development of monoclonal antibodies and their detection is based on the determination using the principle of ELISA or agglutination techniques. An increased D-d level is not completely specific for venous thrombo-embolism
