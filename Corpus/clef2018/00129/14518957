Transacylation and de-esterification reactions of pectin as catalyzed by pectinesterases from tomato and citrus. The optimal conditions for the de-esterification reaction of tomato pectinesterase (PE) and citrus PE was 0.1-0.2 M NaCl and at pH 7.5-8.5, 65 degrees C, almost identical to those for the transacylation reaction as observed by turbidity (absorbance at 400 nm) change. Among the PEs tested, pea pod PE presented the most remarkable catalysis on the transacylation reaction, and 1.5% pectin solution was determined to be suitable for this reaction. Low methoxy pectin with a DE (degree of esterification) of 31% displayed a slow turbidity increase, revealing that the extent of DE was influential on the transacylation. Besides citrus pectin, apple pectin was also proved to progress transacylation reaction by PEs from tomato and citrus sources as apparently observed by turbidity method.
