Induction of crossreactive antibodies against the Plasmodium falciparum variant protein. The variant antigen Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1), present on the surface of P. falciparum-parasitized erythrocytes (PE), plays a central role in naturally acquired immunity, although antibodies to PfEMP1 are predominantly variant specific. To overcome this major limitation for vaccine development, we immunized mice with three cysteine-rich interdomain 1 (CIDR1) domains of PfEMP1 that have the critical function of binding the PE to CD36 on endothelium and thus preventing spleen-dependent killing of the parasite. The immunizations consisted of different combinations of three CIDR1 encoded by DNA followed by recombinant protein boost. Immunizations with a single variant in a prime-boost regimen induced no or low cross-reactivity toward heterologous CIDR1 however, a broad range of crossreactivity was detected in mice that were immunized with all three variants simultaneously. The induced crossreactivity suggests that an anti-PfEMP1 vaccine may be possible.
