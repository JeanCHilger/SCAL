The management and outcome of acute venous thromboembolism: a prospective registry including 4011 patients. To obtain a realistic overview of management and clinical outcomes of patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) in Spain on the basis of data from a national multicenter registry.A prospective registry was initiated in Spain in March 2001. Data were collected from patients with objectively confirmed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) and entered into the online registry by physicians who were responsible for the management of these patients.As of August 2002, 4011 patients with confirmed VTE were included in the registry: 60% with DVT, 23% with PE, and 17% with both DVT and PE. Diagnostic methods for VTE included compression ultrasonography (86%), venography (10%), V/Q lung scans (42%), computed tomography scan (28%), and pulmonary angiography (0.9%). D-dimer testing was performed in 61% of cases and was positive in 92% of patients with confirmed VTE. The majority of DVT (95%) were located in the lower extremities (82% proximal and 4% bilateral), while 4.8% were located in the upper extremities or neck veins. Most patients (90.5%) were admitted to hospital. In the acute phase, treatment consisted of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in 88%, unfractionated heparin (UFH) in 11%, and fibrinolysis in 0.8%. Cava filters were inserted in 2% of patients, mainly because of active bleeding (13%), increased hemorrhagic risk (38%), or recurrent VTE (29%). Absolute bed rest was recommended to 63% of patients. Secondary prevention of VTE included oral anticoagulants (75%) and LMWH (24.5%). Therapeutic compression stockings were prescribed to 53% of patients at the time of hospital discharge. Regarding the main clinical outcomes during an average (+/-SD) follow-up period of 156 +/- 95 days, 19% had adverse events: 12.5% of patients died, 5.5% had clinically confirmed VTE recurrence, and 9.8% suffered bleeding complications (44% with major bleeding).This prospective observational multicenter registry provides a large database reflecting the actual day-to-day clinical practice regarding VTE management in a European country. The most important findings were the increasing use of spiral computed tomography for PE diagnosis, the unexpectedly high proportion of patients admitted to hospital despite the use of LMWH in almost 90% of cases in the acute phase, and the utilization of LMWH for secondary prevention in almost 25% of cases. On the other hand, this large-scale prospective registry permits on-line consultation of high-risk situations to assess how difficult cases were treated and what their outcomes were. This will provide a most useful tool for the practicing physician responsible for the management of VTE patients.
