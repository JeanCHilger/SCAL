P-selectin and platelet-derived microparticles associated with monocyte activation markers in patients with pulmonary embolism. Platelet activation markers (platelet-derived microparticles and P-selectin on activated platelets), chemokines (monocyte chemotactic peptide and regulated on activation normally T-cell expressed and secreted), and soluble markers (sP-selectin, sE-selectin, sVCAM-1, and sCD14) were measured and compared in patients with pulmonary embolism (PE). These substances are thought to participate in the pathogenesis of PE. Levels of all of the platelet activation markers, chemokines, and soluble markers were higher in the patients with PE than in normal controls. Levels of platelet activation markers were also significantly increased postoperatively after total knee arthroplasty. Anti-platelet therapy significantly inhibited the elevation of platelet activation markers after total knee arthroplasty. These findings suggest that antiplatelet therapy may be useful for PE-related interaction of platelets, leukocytes, and endothelial cells.
