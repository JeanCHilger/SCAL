Serum tumour necrosis factor-alpha and soluble tumour necrosis factor receptors levels in patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome. To estimate the serum concentrations of Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and soluble TNF receptors (s TNF-RI and TNF-RII) in patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), before and after treatment.The serum TNF-alpha and the soluble TNF receptors concentrations were measured by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 47 patients with GBS before and after the treatment - IVI therapy (n=26) Plasma Exchange (n=21).At the time of admission, the serum TNF-alpha concentrations were elevated (32.5-182.5 pg/ml) in 41/47 GBS patients (87.2%). Following the treatment (IVIG or PE), there was a significant decrease in the serum TNF-alpha concentrations (8.5-58.5 pg/ml) in these 41 GBS patients. The soluble TNF receptors, particularly sTNF-RII concentrations were significantly increased in GBS patients treated by IVIG therapy.The results of this indicated that (a) Elevated serum concentrations of TNF-alpha showed a positive correlation with the disease severity in patients with GBS. (b) The decrease in the serum TNF-alpha and increase in the serum soluble TNF receptors, particularly sTNF-RII showed a positive correlation with the neurological recovery in GBB patients following treatment.
