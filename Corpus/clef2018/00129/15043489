Cuttoff values of biochemical tests on pleural fluid: their usefulness in differential diagnosis of 1,040 patients with pleural effusion. The aim of biochemical pleural fluid testing is to reach an etiological diagnosis of the pleural effusion. We assessed the utility of considering cuttoff points for the wide range of analytes used to investigate pleural fluid.Among 1,040 patients with pleural effusion, we sought the etiologies of those fluids which showed any of the following characteristics: red blood cell count = 10 x 109/L, leukocytes = 10 x 109/L, percentage of neutrophils or lymphocytes >50%, protein = 50 g/L, glucose = 60 mg/dL, pH = 7.2, lactate dehydrogenase = 1,000 U/L, adenosine deaminase = 40 U/L, amylase = 100 U/L or cholesterol = 60 mg/dL.Some of the more prominent findings were: a) a sixth of transudates were blood-tinged or contained predominantly neutrophils b) a groosly bloody fluid suggests malignant disease, trauma, or pulmonary embolizationCuttof values of biochemical pleural fluid tests may greatly support particular causes of pleural effusions.
