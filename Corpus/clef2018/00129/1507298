D-dimer levels correlate with pathologic thrombosis in trauma patients. Pathologic thrombosis, in the form of pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep venous thrombosis (DVT), causes significant morbidity and mortality in trauma patients and presents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge because of associated conditions in these patients. This study examines the measurement of D-dimer crosslinked fibrin degradation products (D-dimer XDPs) as an indicator of hypercoagulability that places a trauma patient at risk of developing pathologic thrombosis. The time course of changes in D-dimer values after trauma normally involves an initial increase with a rapid decrease of D-dimer XDP levels to normal. Patients who then demonstrate a second rise in D-dimer values are at risk for pathologic thrombosis. Forty-one trauma patients were studied, in two groups, to evaluate the potential use of D-dimer XDP levels in evaluating the risk of pathologic thrombosis. A secondary increase in D-dimer XDP levels was found to occur in patients with PE, although sepsis and adult respiratory distress syndrome can also cause a late increase. However, D-dimer determinations appear to provide an easy, relatively inexpensive means of evaluating trauma patients for the risk of pathologic thrombosis.
