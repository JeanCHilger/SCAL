Interpretation of increased D-dimer values. The determination of D-dimer concentration is an essential part in the diagnostic procedure of thromboembolic diseases, e.g. deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism. D-dimers are the products of fibrin hydrolysis with elevated levels in fibrinolytic processes.In the clinical practice problems exist in the interpretation of increased D-dimer concentrations, especially without thromboembolic disease. Before starting further expensive imaging diagnostics other reasons (i.e. pregnancy, neoplasma, systemic inflammatory disease, advanced arteriosclerosis) should be considered in differential diagnosis.The determination of the concentration of D-dimers is involved in the diagnostic strategy in thromboembolic diseases. However, this parameter is not suited for routine screening. Its high predictive-negative value is proved for the exclusion of thrombosis or pulmonary embolism in case of negative test result. Since a range of diseases and physiological conditions lead to increased D-dimer values, a positive D-dimer result does not verify the diagnosis of thromboembolism.
