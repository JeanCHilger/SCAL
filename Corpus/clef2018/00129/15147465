Do antiphospholipid antibodies increase the long-term risk of thrombotic complications in young patients with a recent TIA or ischemic stroke? The purpose of our study was to determine the relative risk of thrombotic events in young patients with a recent TIA or ischemic stroke and positive antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL).We included 128 consecutive patients aged 18-45 years with a recent TIA or ischemic stroke. All patients underwent computed tomography scanning and were screened for cardiovascular risk factors, cardiac disorders and large vessel disease. Lupus anticoagulant (LA) was screened for by an APTT-based assay and a diluted PT-assay. Anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, using cardiolipin and anti-human IgG and IgM. Thrombotic events could be TIA, stroke, myocardial infarction, deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Product limit estimates of the time free of TIA or stroke and of the time free of any thrombotic event were made. The relative risk was estimated by means of a Cox proportional hazards regression model.Of the 128 patients, 22 (17.2%) had aPL. The mean follow-up was 3 years and 3 months (range 41 days to 6 yrs). The incidence of any thrombotic event per 100 patient years of follow-up was 9.0, and the incidence of recurrent stroke or TIA was 7.9. The relative risk of any thrombotic event in patients with aPL was 0.9 (95% CI: 0.3-2.4) and for recurrent ischemic stroke or TIA 0.7 (95% CI: 0.3-2.2).In young patients with a recent TIA or ischemic stroke, aPL do not seem to be a strong risk factor for recurrent stroke or TIA, nor for other thrombotic complications.
