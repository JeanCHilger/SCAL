New methods for the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary embolism is a high mortality cardiovascular disease, which is difficult to diagnose even today.In this study the symptoms and the results of diagnostic methods were analysed in 81 patients with acute pulmonary embolism, admitted during a one-year period to Kaposi MÃ³r County Hospital. The patient records were examined with special emphasis on the diagnostic value of novel methods such as D-dimer assay and chest computed tomography scanning along with the routine techniques used in the management of pulmonary embolism.In all patients ECG, in 88% of the cases chest X-ray, in 57% blood gas analysis and in 53% D-dimer assay results were evaluated. 14.8% of the patients died during hospitalisation. The following diagnostic imaging procedures were undertaken: in 80.2% of the cases lung scan, in 59.3% echocardiography and in 8.7% of the cases spiral computed tomography scan were prepared. In 12.3% of all cases thrombolysis proved necessary. The results were compared with data from International Cooperative Pulmonary Embolism Registry Study, which analyses 2454 patient cases.It is foreseen that the increasing use of echocardiography, lower limb ultrasound and highly informative spiral computed tomography scanning as an additional means in pulmonary embolism diagnostics may in some cases spare the use of pulmonary scintigraphy.
