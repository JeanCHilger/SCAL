Impact of a rapid rule-out protocol for pulmonary embolism on the rate of screening, missed cases, and pulmonary vascular imaging in an urban US emergency department. This study tests the hypothesis that implementation of a point-of-care emergency department (ED) protocol to rule out pulmonary embolism would increase the rate of evaluation without increasing the rate of pulmonary vascular imaging or ED length of stay and that less than 1.0% of patients with a negative protocol would have an adverse outcome.A baseline study was conducted on patients with suspected pulmonary embolism at an urban ED to establish baseline measurements performed when only pulmonary vascular imaging was available to rule out pulmonary embolism. The intervention protocol used pretest probability assessment, a whole-blood d -dimer assay, and an alveolar dead-space measurement to rule out pulmonary embolism. The main outcomes were diagnosis of venous thromboembolism or sudden unexpected death within 90 days.During baseline, 453 of 61,322 patients (0.74% 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67% to 0.81%) underwent pulmonary vascular imaging, and 8% (95% CI 6% to 11%) of scan results were positiveA point-of-care pulmonary embolism rule-out protocol doubled the rate of screening for pulmonary embolism in the ED, had a false negative rate of less than 1.0%, did not increase the pulmonary vascular imaging rate, and decreased length of stay.
