Evaluation of venous thromboembolism and coagulation-fibrinolysis markers in Japanese patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Arterial or venous thromboembolism is rarely encountered clinically as an extradigestive tract complication in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, it is one of the important prognostic factors for IBD patients. The present study was designed to evaluate the relationship between pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with coagulation-fibrinolysis markers in patients with active IBD.In 47 consecutive cases hospitalized due to active IBD [26 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 21 with ulcerative colitis (UC)], we evaluated the disease severity, blood tests, pulmonary ventilation-perfusion scan (V/Q scan), and magnetic resonance venography (MRV) or conventional venography.PE was diagnosed by V/Q scan in 5 (2 with CD and 3 with UC 10.6%). DVT was diagnosed in 5 (2 with CD and 3 with UCA high incidence of venous thromboembolism was suggested in Japanese patients with active IBD. We should be careful with thrombosis in treatment of IBD patients, especially those who are of older age and in more severe stages.
