A dot-blot ELISA comparable to immunoblot for the specific diagnosis of human parastrongyliasis. A dot-blot enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (dot-blot ELISA) using an electroeluted 31-kDa glycoprotein from adult worms of Parastrongylus cantonensis as the specific antigen was evaluated for the immunological diagnosis of patients infected with P. cantonensis. The sensitivity and specificity for the detection of serum antibody to P. cantonensis in dot-blot ELISA were both 100%, as determined with serum samples of ten P. cantonensis-infected patients, 60 patients with other related parasitic infections, and 20 uninfected controls. The test was as sensitive and specific as the immunoblot test which revealed a reactive band of 31 kDa. Both the dot-blot ELISA and immunoblot detected all sera from ten P. cantonensis-infected individuals, but not with those of other heterologous parasitoses (gnathostomiasis, toxocariasis, filariasis, paragonimiasis, cysticercosis and malaria) or sera from healthy controls. The dot-blot ELISA is much simpler to perform than the immunoblot technique, and the test can be applied under field conditions where sophisticated facilities are lacking.
