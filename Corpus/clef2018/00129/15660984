Treatment of factor XI inhibitor using recombinant activated factor VIIa. A 30-year-old female with severe factor XI deficiency of 0-2% acquired factor XI inhibitor following many infusions for fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for surgical procedures starting at 4 years of age. Seven months before this inhibitor was diagnosed, surgery was complicated by prolonged bleeding resistant to FFP, requiring epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA) and surgical packing. The inhibitor was measured at 2.2 Bethesda units, 7 months since the last FFP. The inhibitor was confirmed as specific anti-XI and anti-XIa binding by patient's IgG to immobilized factor XI and factor XIa from whole plasma and purified IgG. For repair of a painful anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) defect she was given recombinant factor VIIa (rVIIa) at 90 mug kg(-1), starting one-half hour preoperatively and continued every 2 h for 8 h when haemostasis was complete. Thereafter the rVIIa was given every 3 h for two doses, and then every 4 h for four doses at which time she was discharged on EACA which was continued for 6 days. There was excellent haemostasis during and following the surgery. There was no evidence of consumptive coagulopathy, with no change in the fibrinogen, platelet count, or D-D dimer and no increase of platelet factor 4, beta-thromboglobulin, or prothrombin fragment F 1.2. The thrombin-antithrombin complex increased over baseline after 24 h. There was no postoperative deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolus. In this patient with a factor XI inhibitor, the recombinant factor VIIa was effective and safe, ensuring adequate haemostasis with no thrombotic complications. This product which was designed for patients with inhibitors to factor VIII or factor IX, and factor VII deficiency, has now been given successfully to four patients with factor XI inhibitors.
