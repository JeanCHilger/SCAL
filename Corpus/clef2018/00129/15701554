New strategies for the prevention of malaria in travelers. Malaria prevention has benefited from many diverse disciplines of research, including epidemiologic monitoring, development of laboratory techniques, assessment of insect repellents, or pharmaceutical innovations. Strategies in all these sectors have been explored in recent years, resulting in improved options to prevent travelers' malaria.
