Benidipine, a long-acting calcium channel blocker, inhibits cardiac remodeling in pressure-overloaded mice. The effects of long-acting calcium channel blockers (CCBs) on pressure overload-induced cardiac remodeling are seldom studied in animals. We evaluated the effects of benidipine, a long-acting CCB, on cardiac remodeling.Rat neonatal cardiac myocytes were used to examine the influence of benidipine on protein synthesis. Cardiac remodeling was induced in C57 B6/J mice by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Then the effects of benidipine (10 mg/kg/d) were assessed on myocardial hypertrophy and heart failure, cardiac histology, and gene expression.Benidipine significantly inhibited protein synthesis by cardiac myocytes stimulated with phenylephrine (PE), and this effect was partially abolished by cotreatment with a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor [N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methylester (l-NAME)]. Four weeks after the onset of pressure overload, benidipine therapy potently inhibited cardiac hypertrophy and prevented heart failure. The heart to body weight ratio was 6.89+/-0.48 mg/g in treated mice vs. 8.76+/-0.33 mg/g in untreated mice (P<0.01), and the lung to body weight ratio was 7.39+/-0.93 mg/g vs. 10.53+/-0.99 mg/g, respectively (P<0.05). Left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS) was improved on echocardiography. Plasma NO levels were increased, while B type natriuretic peptide, protein inhibitor of neuronal NOS, and procollagen IV alpha were down-regulated in benidipine-treated mice.These results indicate that benidipine inhibits cardiac remodeling due to pressure overload at least partly by acting on the nitric oxide signaling pathway.
