Transfusion-transmitted malaria, preventive measures. Malaria is a blood parasitic disease in the first place among the most prevalent communicable infectious diseases over the world, which leads to an increased risk of transfusion transmitted malaria. Preventive measures have been undertaken to screen blood donors such as discarding red cell donations according to the medical history, travel history and detection of malarial antibodies. However, these measures may be not sufficient and reliable to avoid the risk of transmission. Preliminary data indicates that combination of travel history, detection of malarial antibodies and antigens by commercialized kits adapted to blood transfusion centres either in endemic or non endemic areas may improve malaria transfusion risk management.
