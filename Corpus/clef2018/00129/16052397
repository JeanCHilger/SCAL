Blood rheology and risk of thromboembolism in adult and climacteric women. Increased age is associated with an increased thrombosing tendency, especially deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. We investigated blood flow in women of various age groups and found that blood flow decreases with advancing age. Because decreased blood flow can lead to platelet and leukocyte activation, it could be related to the pathogenesis of venous thromboembolism with age.
