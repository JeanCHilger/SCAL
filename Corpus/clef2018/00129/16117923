D-dimer in acute aortic dissection. D-dimer measurement is widely accepted as a diagnostic test for pulmonary embolism in cases in which a negative value has a high predictive power. We present two cases of acute thoracic aortic dissection with particularly high D-dimer values and discuss the diagnostic value of D-dimer as an initial test with suspected aortic dissection.
