The significance of elevated troponin levels in the absence of acute cardiac ischaemia. Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and cardiac troponin T (cTnT) are valuable heart markers in patients presenting with symptoms of ischaemic heart disease. A number of categories of patients frequently have raised concentrations of cardiac troponin (cTn) without having ischaemic heart disease. These include patients with heart diseases such as heart failure, myocarditis and valvular disease but also those with lung emboli, renal failure and sepsis. Possible underlying mechanisms are diffuse necrosis, cTn proteolysis or leakage of cytoplasmatic cTn with no irreversible damage to the contraction complex of heart-muscle cells. It is possible that cTn-measurement in patients with non-cardiac conditions is of prognostic value but so far this has only been demonstrated in dialysis patients and patients with pulmonary embolism.
