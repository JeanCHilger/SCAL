B-type natriuretic peptide: issues for the intensivist and pulmonologist. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP), although promising as biomarkers for heart failure, are affected by multiple confounders. The purpose of this article is to review the literature on the utility of BNP and NT-proBNP as biomarkers, with a focus on their role in critical illness and pulmonary diseases.Published articles on BNP and NT-proBNP.Multiple disorders in the intensive care unit cause elevated BNP and NT-proBNP levels, including cardiac diseases, shock, pulmonary hypertension, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute pulmonary embolism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal failure, and other conditions.Intensivists and pulmonologists should understand that BNP and NT-proBNP levels might be raised to different degrees not only in heart failure but also in critical illness and various pulmonary diseases in these situations, BNP and NT-proBNP may also serve as markers of severity and prognosis.
