New approaches in vaccine development for parasitic infections. Vaccines have had a tremendous impact on the control of infectious diseases. Not only are vaccines potentially the least expensive mechanism to combat infectious diseases, under optimal conditions, widespread vaccination can result in disease eradication - as in the case of smallpox. Despite this great potential, vaccines have had little impact on human parasitic infections. The reasons for this are many - these eukaryotic pathogens are genetically and biologically complex organisms, some with elaborate life cycles and well-honed immune evasion mechanisms. Additionally, our understanding of the mechanisms of immune control of many parasitic infections -- of what constitutes an effective immune response and of how to induce high-quality immunological memory -- is not fully developed. This review attempts to highlight recent advances that could impact vaccine discovery and development in parasitic infections and proposes areas where future studies may lead to breakthroughs in vaccines for the agents of parasitic diseases. There are several other recent reviews highlighting the results of vaccine trials, specifically in the malaria field.
