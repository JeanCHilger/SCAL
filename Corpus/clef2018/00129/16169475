Malaria: endless fascination with merozoite release. The erythrocytic asexual reproduction cycle of Plasmodium falciparum, the most lethal malaria parasite in humans, starts with the invasion of a red blood cell by a merozoite and ends with the release of up to 32 new copies of itself in about 48 hours. A new study reveals that merozoite release is an explosive event ensuring the dispersal of these non-motile parasites for optimal re-invasion of new red cells.
