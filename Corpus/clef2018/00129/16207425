Effects of thrombolysis and anticoagulation on the functions of vascular endothelial cells and coagulation and fibrinolysis in patients with pulmonary thromboembolism. To investigate the effects of thrombolysis and anticoagulation on the functions of vascular endothelial cells and coagulation and fibrinolysis in patients with pulmonary thromboembolism.Twenty-four patients with documented pulmonary thromboembolism and 20 normal subjects were included. Of the 24 patients with pulmonary thromboembolism, 7 were treated with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator intravenously, and 17 with low molecular weight heparin. The plasma levels of endothelin 1 (ET-1), tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), antithrombin III (AT-III) and D-dimer and the blood serum levels of nitrogen monoxide (NO) were measured in the control group and in the patients at different time points before and after therapies.In patients receiving thrombolytic therapy, ET-1 [(103.7 +/- 26.6) ng/L] and D-dimer [(5.0 +/- 1.7) mg/L] increased significantly at 4 h after the treatment, and were higher than those at other time points (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). The level of ET-1 was correlated positively with PaO(2) and D-dimer (r = 0.751, and 0.782 respectively, P < 0.05). In patients receiving anticoagulation therapy, compared with pretreatment data, NO and AT-III increased and ET-1 decreased significantly at 14 d after the start of low molecular weight heparin therapy, (48 +/- 14) micromol/L vs (66 +/- 24) micromol/L for NO, (90 +/- 7)% vs (99 +/- 4)% for AT-III, (72.0 +/- 18.3) ng/L vs (52.8 +/- 13.9) ng/L for ET-1, all P < 0.05.ET-1 and D-dimer changed significantly after thrombolytic therapy, while ET-1, NO and AT-III showed dramatic change after anticoagulation therapy. The change of ET-1 and D-dimer reflects the therapeutic effects. Thrombolytic and anticoagulation therapies are beneficial in keeping the balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis and protecting the functions of vascular endothelial cells in patients with pulmonary thromboembolism.
