Two cases of inflammatory muscle disease presenting with raised serum concentrations of troponin T. Troponins T and I are highly sensitive markers of myocardial injury. However, non-cardiac disorders, such as pulmonary embolism, renal failure, subarachnoid haemorrhage, sepsis, eclampsia, chemotherapy, and inflammatory muscle conditions (dermatomyositis and polymyositis), can also result in raised serum troponin concentrations. This article describes two cases that occurred within a month of each other in Craigavon Area Hospital, whereby conditions unrelated to myocardial ischaemia resulted in raised concentrations of cardiac markers. The first patient, in retrospect, underwent unnecessary investigation as an inpatient in the cardiac ward. Experience gained from this case led to more appropriate consultation and management of the second patient.
