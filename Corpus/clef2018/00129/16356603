Phase I safety and immunogenicity trial of FMP1/AS02A, a Plasmodium falciparum MSP-1 asexual blood stage vaccine. We report the first safety and immunogenicity trial of the Plasmodium falciparum malaria blood stage vaccine candidate, FMP1/AS02A consisting of the FMP1 antigen, an Escherichia coli-expressed His-tagged fusion protein from the 42 kDa C-terminal fragment from the 3D7 clone of the merozoite surface protein 1 formulated in the AS02A adjuvant. An open label, prospective, single-center Phase I dose escalation trial of FMP1/AS02A was conducted in 15 adult malaria-na√Øve human volunteers to assess safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity. The vaccine was safe and well-tolerated and no serious adverse events were observed. The vaccine induced high-titer ELISA and IFA responses in all volunteers. Proliferative and ELISPOT responses were induced to vaccine antigen. Biologically active antibodies were induced as measured by GIA. This study establishes the foundation to further evaluate and measure the vaccine's ability to reduce morbidity and mortality in target populations directly affected by P. falciparum malaria.
