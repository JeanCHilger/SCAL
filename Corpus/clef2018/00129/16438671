Antigen presentation and dendritic cell biology in malaria. Dendritic cells (DCs) are important both in amplifying the innate immune response and in initiating adaptive immunity and shaping the type of T helper (Th) response. Although the role of DCs in immune responses to many intracellular pathogens has been delineated and research is underway to identify the mechanisms involved, relatively little is known concerning the role of DCs in immunity to malaria. In this review, we provide an overview and summary of previous and current studies aimed to investigate the role of DCs as antigen presenting cells (APCs). In addition, the role of DCs in inducing innate and adaptive immunity to blood-stage malaria is discussed and, where information is available, the mechanisms involved are presented. Data from studies in humans infected with Plasmodium falciparum, the major human parasite responsible for the high morbidity and mortality associated with malaria throughout many regions of the developing world, as well as data from experimental mouse models are presented. Overall, the data from these studies are conflicting. The possible reasons for these differences, including the use of different parasite species and parasite strains in the mouse studies, are discussed. Nevertheless, together the data have important implications for development of an effective malaria vaccine since the selection of appropriate Plasmodium antigens and/or adjuvants, targeting innate immune responses involving DCs, may provide optimal protection against malaria. It is hoped that this review promotes more investigation among malariologists and immunologists alike on DCs and malaria.
