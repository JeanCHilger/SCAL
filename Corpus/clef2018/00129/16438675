Regulating immunity to malaria. The optimal outcome of a malaria infection is that parasitized cells are killed and degraded without inducing significant pathology. Since much of the pathology of malaria infection can be immune-mediated, this implies that immune responses have to be carefully regulated. The mechanisms by which anti-malarial immune responses are believed to be regulated were discussed at the recent Malaria Immunology Workshop (Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA February 2005). Potential regulatory mechanisms include regulatory T cells, which have been shown to significantly modify cellular immune responses to various protozoan infections, including leishmania and malaria
