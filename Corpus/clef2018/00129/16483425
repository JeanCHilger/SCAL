Comparison with the Pan Malaria IgG assays for malaria diagnosis and direct microscopy among suspected malaria patients in Sanliurfa. In this study, we evaluated the usage of the Pan Malaria IgG CELISA test in the diagnosis of malarial infections in Siverek-Sanliurfa, Turkey, where malarial infection is endemic and there are minimal health services available. The Pan Malaria IgG CELISA (Cellabs) test, which uses recombinant antigens and detects exposure to all four forms of malaria (P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale and P. malariae) was used as individuals. Using the consensus microscopy results as the standard, sensitivity of ELISA for detection of any malarial infection in the rural populations was 83%, specificity was 85%. These results show that the performance of ELISA for the detection of any malarial infection is adequate for acute- and post-emergency situations and rural populations when the alternative is just clinical diagnosis.
