Anti-phosphatidylserine-prothrombin complex antibodies in patients with localized scleroderma. Although some antiphospholipid antibodies (Abs) are found in patients with localized scleroderma (LSc), Ab against phosphatidylserine-prothrombin complex (PS/PT) has not been examined. We investigated anti-PS/PT Ab levels in patients with LSc.IgG anti-PS/PT Ab levels in serum samples taken from patients with LSc (n = 42) were measured using ELISA.IgG anti-PS/PT Ab was detected in 17% of the LSc patients, while it was not detected in any normal controls (n = 32) or psoriasis vulgaris (n = 25), and this frequency was similar to that of systemic sclerosis (17%, n = 41). Among 3 LSc subgroups, generalized morphea, the severest form of LSc, had a frequency (27%) comparable with that of systemic lupus erythematosus (32%, n = 25). Among 7 LSc patients with anti-PS/PT Ab, 2 developed symptomatic thromboembolism (A 70-year-old man developed deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary infarction, although he was negative for other antiphospholipid Abs. A 6-year-old boy positive for lupus anticoagulant had cerebral infarction). By contrast, symptomatic thromboembolism was not detected in 35 LSc patients without anti-PS/PT Ab.Patients with LSc, especially generalized morphea, exhibit anti-PS/PT Ab at a frequency comparable with collagen diseases such as systemic sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosis. Examination of this Ab may be useful to recognize the risk of thromboembolism in patients with LSc.
