Acute-phase reactants and markers of inflammation in venous thromboembolic disease: correlation with clinical and evolution parameters. To asses the association of acute reactants and interleukin 6 and 8 (IL-6 & IL-8) at diagnosis of venous thromboembolic disease (VTD) and clinical outcome.100 patients were diagnosed of VTD by image tests. Acute reactants (C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), fibrinogen), D-dimer and IL-6 and IL-8 we measured at the moment of diagnosis. We made a 12 month follow-up of these patients to notice any clinical evolution outcomes (recurrences, bleeding, post-phlebitic syndrome, death).IL-6 was increased in 9 patients and IL-8 in 3. The risk factors, time to diagnosis and pulmonary embolism rate were similar in both interleukin groups (normal and high levels). Fibrinogen levels were significantly increased in high IL-6 group (585 +/- 179 vs. 485 +/- 154 mgr/dl p = 0.05). During follow-up there were 5 deaths, 3 recurrences, 11 bleedings and 43 postphlebitic syndromes. Normal ESR level was associated to postphlebitic syndrome (17.8 +/- 14.5 vs. 31.4 +/- 27.4 mm/1st hIL-6, ESR, and CPR at diagnosis of VTD could be useful to identified patients with higher risks of death and postphlebitic syndrome during the first year after diagnosis.
