In vitro processing of donors' blood with quinine for elimination of malaria parasites. To eliminate malaria parasites in donors' blood in vitro for eradication of transfusion-induced malaria.We conducted the study at Ahmed Gasim Hospital in Khartoum, Sudan, between January 2005 and January 2006. Out of 4484 blood samples screened for malaria parasite microscopically, only 30 (200 ml each) satisfied the inclusion criteria of this study. The samples were subdivided equally into 4 portions. Three concentrations of quinine were separately added to 3 specimens while the fourth left without quinine (control). Blood specimens were tested on the day of collection by hematological and biochemical techniques simultaneously, and after 24 and 48 hours at 4-6 degrees celcius by the same techniques.The number of malaria parasites killed were found to be proportional to the concentrations of quinine and to the storage period, while donors' blood samples without quinine revealed a stable number of the viable parasites during the storage. Quinine was highly effective within 24 hours storage. The detected lethal dose of the applied drug to malaria parasites was generally safe to all constituents of the stored blood.Our study shows that quinine could be used for the eradication of transfusion-induced malaria by in vitro processing of donors blood. The optimal doses could be added to bags' blood post phlebotomy.
