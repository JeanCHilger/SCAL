Estrus cycle: influence on cardiac function following trauma-hemorrhage. Since cardiac function is depressed in males but not in proestrus (PE) females following trauma-hemorrhage (T-H), we examined whether different estrus cycles influence cardiac function in female rats under those conditions. We hypothesized that females in the PE cycle only will have normal cardiac function following T-H and resuscitation. Sham operation or T-H was performed in five groups of rats (250-275 g) including PE, estrus (E), metestrus (ME), diestrus (DE), and ovariectomized (OVX) females (n = 6-7 per group). Cardiac function was determined 2 h after T-H, following which cardiomyocytes were isolated and nuclei extracted. Cardiomyocyte IL-6 and NF-kappaB expressions were measured using Western blotting. Moreover, plasma IL-6, estradiol, and progesterone levels were measured using ELISA or EIA kits. Results (1-way ANOVA) indicated that following T-H, 1) cardiac function was depressed in DE, E, ME, and OVX groups but maintained in the PE group 2) the PE group had the highest plasma estrogen level
