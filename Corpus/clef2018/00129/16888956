Autoimmune thrombocytopenia in recurrent polietiological malaria (Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax). Thrombocytopenia frequently appear in severe malaria. The reasons of low blood platelets count are different and its results of hypersplenism, subclinical course of intravascular coagulation (DIC). Thrombocytopenia from "consumption" is consequence of sequestration of blood platelets in blood vessels of lungs and cerebral. We examination 29 years old men, who was as forest worker in islands on Indonesia. He was treated with recurrent, poliethiological malaria (Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivar) and severe thrombocytopenia (17.0 G/L) without hepatosplenomegalia. Antiplatelet antibody was examined in blood serum by ELISA methods (GTI - PAKPLUS. In blood serum was detected IgG antibody agai nstglicoprotein receptors on surface of blood platelets GPIIb/IIIa, GPIV, GPIb/IX, GPV, GPIa/IIa. Chronic infections of Plasmodium may conduct to autoimmune destruction of blood platelets.
