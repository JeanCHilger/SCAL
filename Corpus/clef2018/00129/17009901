Amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide: a biomarker for diagnosis, prognosis and management of heart failure. There is a substantial need for a diagnostic tool to aid in the early diagnosis of heart failure and in the recognition of those at risk for its development, as well as in guidance of therapy. Testing for amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) has been recognized to have utility in the diagnosis, prognosis and management of heart failure. In addition, numerous other applications for NT-proBNP testing are now recognized, such as evaluation of patients with heart disease in the absence of heart failure, as well as the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of patients with acute coronary syndromes or pulmonary thromboembolism.
