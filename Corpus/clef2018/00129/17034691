Evaluation of tests for serological diagnosis of scrub typhus. Two specific serological tests, a Dot enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and an immunoglobulin (Ig)M enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the 56 kDa antigen and the Weil-Felix test were evaluated for diagnosis of scrub typhus. Sensitivity of 100, 86.5 and 43.5% were observed with Dot EIA, IgM ELISA and Weil-Felix test, respectively. False-positive reactions were observed in patients with falciparum malaria, pulmonary tuberculosis, S. viridans septicemia and typhoid fever using Dot EIA and IgM ELISA. Therefore, although Dot EIA and IgM ELISA are useful in the serodiagnosis of scrub typhus, efforts should be made to rule out other febrile illnesses.
