Definition of the epitope recognized by the Plasmodium falciparum-reactive human monoclonal antibody 33G2. The human monoclonal antibody 33G2 has earlier been shown to inhibit merozoite reinvasion of red blood cells in Plasmodium falciparum cultures in vitro and to inhibit cytoadherence of infected red blood cells to melanoma cells in vitro. 33G2 cross-reacts with a family of P. falciparum antigens, Ag332, Pf11.1 and Pf155/RESA, sharing a common feature of repeated sequences consisting of regularly spaced pairs of glutamic acid. Peptides corresponding to residues 2-19 of the known amino acid sequence of Ag332 have been shown earlier to have the highest inhibitory capacity of antibody binding to infected red blood cells. Using the PEPSCAN method, overlapping hepta-, hexa-, penta- and tetrapeptides corresponding to residues 1-19 of the known sequence of Ag332 were synthesized. Antibody fine specificity was examined by synthesizing an octapeptide (residues 1-8) and all possible single amino acid substitutions. The monoclonal antibody was shown to react with a linear 5-amino acid-long sequence corresponding to Ag332 residues 3-7: VTEEI. These amino acids were irreplaceable or only partially replaceable in the replacement set analysis. Furthermore, epitope analogs corresponding to sequences contained within the Pf11.1 repeats and overlapping heptapeptides corresponding to Pf155/RESA repeats were synthesized. Reactivity to epitope analogs and Pf155/RESA peptides provided information which may explain antibody cross-reactivity. The defined epitope of this monoclonal antibody is of interest as a potential B cell epitope for the development of a malaria subunit vaccine.
