Comparison of different diagnostic techniques in Plasmodium falciparum cerebral malaria. Plasmodium falciparum cerebral malaria remains a major health problem in India. The efficacy of treatment of cerebral malaria lies in its early diagnosis through rapid diagnostic methods. ParaSights-F test detects HRP-2 antigen secreted by parasitised red blood cells and quantitative buffy coat assay (QBC) is examination of buffy coat for the presence of malarial parasite stained with acridine orange. This study was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of ParaSight-F test and QBC assay as diagnostic methods in the patients of cerebral malaria.Fifty clinically diagnosed patients of cerebral malaria were included in the study. ParaSight-F test, QBC and conventional blood smear examination was done. Patients who were in coma and there were no obvious features of bacterial or viral etiology were investigated for cerebral malaria by these diagnostic methods.ParaSight-F test, QBC and peripheral blood smears were examined. Patients were followed-up for signs of clinical recovery. ParaSight-F test was positive in 47 patients, QBC in 46 while blood smear examination was positive in 28 cases.Sensitivity and specificity of ParaSight-F test were found to be 96.6 and 94% while QBC showed 97.8 and 100% respectively. ParaSight-F test and QBC were found to be novel methods for diagnosis of cerebral malaria especially in the cases where diagnosis can not be made by conventional blood smear examination due to low parasitaemia. These rapid diagnostic methods help in early therapeutic intervention.
