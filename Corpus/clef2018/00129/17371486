Platelet activation in acute pulmonary embolism. Platelet activation is implicated in thrombotic disorders, but has not been described in acute clinical pulmonary embolism (PE).To investigate the natural history of platelet activation in PE and associated markers of inflammation, thrombosis and cardiac dysfunction.Thirty-five consecutive patients (age 62 +/-17 years) with acute PE were prospectively enrolled and followed for 6 months. Platelet activation was assessed by flow cytometry [measuring expression of platelet P-selectin, conformational activation of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex (PAC-1) and formation of platelet-leukocyte complexes] and by plasma soluble P-selectin. Platelet activation, right ventricular (RV) function (assessed as RV ejection area by transthoracic echocardiography), D-dimer and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were measured at presentation and repeated over 6 months follow-up.Soluble P-selectin (56 +/-19 ng mL(-1), anovaP < 0.0001) and PAC-1 (1.5 +/- 1.8%, anovaP = 0.005) were mildly but significantly increased in patients with acute PE relative to healthy young men (soluble P-selectin 33 +/- 13 ng mL(-1), P < 0.001 PAC-1 binding 0.5 +/- 0.6%, P < 0.01) and age-matched controls (soluble P-selectin 31 +/- 9 ng mL(-1), P < 0.001Platelet activation is evident after acute PE. Platelet activation correlates with the severity of RV dysfunction, and can persist for several months after acute PE.
