An overview of methods for detection of factor V Leiden and the prothrombin G20210A mutations. Venous thromboembolism, represented by deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, is a common disease with high mortality and morbidity. Within the last 25 years, risk factors for venous thromboembolism have been linked to mutations in the genes of the coagulation/anticoagulation system. Factor V Leiden and the prothrombin G20210A mutations are the most prevalent inherited risk factors predisposing to venous thromboembolism in the Western world. Tests to detect these mutations are carried out when investigating a personal or family history of venous thromboembolism. At the present, there are several different methods available for the detection of these mutations in the laboratory. The choice of the method will depend on many variables. This article is aimed at reviewing the available methods for the detection of factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A mutations, their principle, applicability, advantages and disadvantages of use.
