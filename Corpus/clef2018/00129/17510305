High concentrations of soluble P-selectin are associated with risk of venous thromboembolism and the P-selectin Thr715 variant. The cell adhesion molecule P-selectin has an important role in the pathophysiology of thrombosis. The effect on venous thromboembolism (VTE) of increased circulating concentrations of soluble P-selectin (sP-selectin) and their association with the P-selectin variant Thr715Pro is still uncertain.This study was a case-control study of 116 patients with confirmed recurrent VTE and at least 1 event of unprovoked deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and 129 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals. We measured sP-selectin by ELISA and P-selectin gene (SELP) variation by genotyping and sampled blood after a mean interval of 2.55 years after the most recent VTE event.The mean (SD) sP-selectin concentration was higher in patients than in controls: 47.3 (15.0) microg/L vs 36.8 (11.0) microg/L, P <0.001. The unadjusted odds ratio (OR) for sP-selectin >55.1 microg/L, representing the 95th percentile for controls, was 8.5 (95% CI, 3.7-23.3 P <0.001) and increased after adjustment for factor V Leiden, the prothrombin G20210A variant, increased factor VIII, and hyperhomocysteinemia (OR, 10.6Increased sP-selectin concentrations are associated with VTE and genotype status. sP-selectin concentrations are lower in individuals carrying the P-selectin Pro715 variant than in those without this variant.
