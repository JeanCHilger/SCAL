Prognostic value of troponins in acute pulmonary embolism: a meta-analysis. Whether elevated serum troponin levels identify patients with acute pulmonary embolism at high risk of short-term mortality or adverse outcome is undefined.We performed a meta-analysis of studies in patients with acute pulmonary embolism to assess the prognostic value of elevated troponin levels for short-term death and adverse outcome events (composite of death and any of the following: shock, need for thrombolysis, endotracheal intubation, catecholamine infusion, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or recurrent pulmonary embolism). Unrestricted searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE bibliographic databases from January 1998 to November 2006 were performed using the terms "troponin" and "pulmonary embolism." Additionally, review articles and bibliographies were manually searched. Cohort studies were included if they had used cardiac-specific troponin assays and had reported on short-term death or adverse outcome events. A random-effects model was used to pool study results funnel-plot inspection was done to evaluate publication biasElevated troponin levels identify patients with acute pulmonary embolism at high risk of short-term death and adverse outcome events.
