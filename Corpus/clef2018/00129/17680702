Toward a framework for sulfoproteomics: Synthesis and characterization of sulfotyrosine-containing peptides. Tyrosine sulfation is one of the most common post-translational modifications in secreted and transmembrane proteins and a key modulator of extracellular protein-protein interactions. Several proteins known to be tyrosine sulfated play important roles in physiological processes, and in some cases a direct link between protein function and tyrosine sulfation has been established. In blood coagulation, tyrosine sulfation of factor VIII is required for efficient binding of von Willebrand factor in leukocyte adhesion, tyrosine sulfation of the P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 mediates high-affinity binding to P-selectin
