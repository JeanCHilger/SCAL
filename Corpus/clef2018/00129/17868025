Antitumour activity of cationic-liposome-conjugated adenovirus containing the CCL19 [chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 19] gene. CCL19 [chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 19 also known as MIP-3beta (macrophage inflammatory protein-3beta) or ELC (Epstein-Barr-virus-induced molecule 1 ligand chemokine)], one of the immunostimulatory cytokines, chemoattracts both DCs (dendritic cells) and T-lymphocytes. Adenoviral vector is one of the most used gene delivery vectors for cancer therapy because of its high gene-transfection efficiency. However, its wider application is limited, owing to immune responses that reduce transgene expression and decrease the efficacy of repeated administration. We constructed the recombinant replication deficient adenoviral vectors containing the CCL19 gene (Ad-CCL19) and combined them with PEG-PE [poly(ethylene glycol)-phosphatidylethanolamine]-modified cationic liposomes (Ad-CCL19/PEG-PE) for immunotherapy against murine fibrosarcoma. Although there were hardly any therapeutic differences between Ad-CCL19- and Ad-CCL19/PEG-PE-treated mice that were observed at the second administration, the final results demonstrated that Ad-CCL19/PEG-PE-treated mice survived much longer. The antitumour efficacy may be related to the high level of CCL19 after the final administration and lasting expression of IFN-gamma (interferon-gamma) and IL-12 (interleukin-12) in the Ad-CCL19/PEG-PE-treated group, which were measured by reverse-transcription PCR and ELISA. The results demonstrated that PEG-PE-cationic-liposome-conjugated adenovirus could prolong the expression of the therapeutic gene in vivo and may enhance the antitumour efficacy.
