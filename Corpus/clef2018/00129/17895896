High incidence of silent venous thromboembolism before treatment in ovarian cancer. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) such as deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) often occurs after surgery and rarely occurs even before surgery in patients with ovarian cancer. It is well known that levels of plasma D-dimer (DD) before treatment in most ovarian cancer patients are increased. This study therefore examined whether increased levels of DD are associated with presence of VTE before treatment of ovarian cancer. Between November 2004 and March 2007, DD levels prior to initial treatment were measured in 72 consecutive patients with presumed epithelial ovarian cancer (final diagnosis: epithelial ovarian cancer, n=60 and epithelial ovarian borderline malignancy, n=12). Venous ultrasound imaging (VUI) of the lower extremity was conducted for all patients except for two patients in whom DVT was detected by pelvic computed tomography (CT). When DVT was found, pulmonary scintigraphy was subsequently performed to ascertain presence of PTE. D-dimer levels were above the cut-off value (0.5 microg ml(-1)) in 65 of 72 patients (90.2%). Venous ultrasound imaging or CT revealed DVT in 18 of 72 patients (25.0%) and pulmonary scintigraphy found PTE in 8 patients (11.1%). All patients with VTE were asymptomatic when VTE was found. D-dimer levels were associated with incidence of VTE (0-1.4 microg ml(-1)
