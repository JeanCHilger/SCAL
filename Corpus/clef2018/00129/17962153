Rapid diagnostic test for malaria: preliminary study in Madagascar in 2003. This study was conducted in 2003 as part of the training of laboratory technicians in the use of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria and to evaluate these tests in Madagascar in field conditions for the first time. Two types of RDT were used separately. The dipstick (Optimal-I) that detects circulating pLDH was tested in 168 patients with clinically suspected malaria (fever or recent history of fever) at primary health centers. Microscopy confirmed malaria in 93/168 (55.4%) cases. Monoparasitic P. falciparum infection was identified in 86/93, P. malariae in 3/93, P. vivax in 3/93 and P. ovale in 1/93. A positive Optimal-I test was a highly sensitive indicator of P. falciparum infection with parasitemia exceeding 500 trophozoites/mul (sensitivity of 97.2% with a specificity of 100%)
