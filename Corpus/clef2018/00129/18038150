Diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in pregnancy in sub-Saharan Africa: the challenges and public health implications. Plasmodium falciparum malaria in pregnancy is a major public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa and represents enormous diagnostic challenge. The objective of this report was to review scientific data from studies conducted in sub-Saharan Africa on the diagnosis of malaria in pregnancy within the last two decades (1987 to 2007), to highlight the challenges and the public health implications. Using the Medline Entrez-Pubmed search, relevant publications were identified for the review via combinations of key words such as Malaria, Pregnancy, and Sub-Saharan Africa, which yielded 777 entries as of September 2007. The results from the various studies were discordant, due to differences in the techniques of sample collection and analysis, based on the differences in the definition of clinical, peripheral, and placental malaria. Definitions were based on the presence of malaria parasite and/or pigments in blood smear from peripheral/placental blood, on histological placental findings, on the use of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Nonspecific clinical presentation of malaria, lack of efficient diagnostic facilities and trained personnel, and absence of regulatory standards for diagnostic tests, are some of the major diagnostic challenges. Increased allocation of resources to development and application of accurate diagnostics will improve malaria diagnosis in pregnancy.
