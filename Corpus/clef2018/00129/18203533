Deep vein thrombosis in the psychiatric patients under physical restraint. Pulmonary thromboembolism induced by deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is known as economy-class syndrome, is one of sudden death in psychiatric patients under physical restraint. (1) A decrease in venous blood flow, (2) damage to vessel walls, and (3) the enhancement of blood clotting are the major risk factors for DVT (Virchow triad). It has been speculated that physical restraint inhibits venous blood flow, and that antipsychotic drugs facilitate blood clotting. In order to prevent sudden death due to DVT, prophylactic measures and early diagnosis are crucial. Whereas Doppler ultrasonography and contrast venography are the gold standards for the diagnosis of DVT, more simplified methods are now under development. Of those, D-dimer measurement, which can be conducted with a small blood sample, is the most potent candidate for the biochemical diagnosis of DVT. Although there are many prophylactic measures, including anticoagulant medications and physical therapies, it is not clear which is the most effective and suitable in psychiatric practice. Psychiatric professionals should pay closer attention to DVT in psychiatric patients under physical restraint.
