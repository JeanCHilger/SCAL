Rapid diagnostic tests for malaria at sites of varying transmission intensity in Uganda. In Africa, fever is often treated presumptively as malaria, resulting in misdiagnosis and the overuse of antimalarial drugs. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria may allow improved fever management.We compared RDTs based on histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) and RDTs based on Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) with expert microscopy and PCR-corrected microscopy for 7000 patients at sites of varying malaria transmission intensity across Uganda.When all sites were considered, the sensitivity of the HRP2-based test was 97% when compared with microscopy and 98% when corrected by PCR the sensitivity of the pLDH-based test was 88% when compared with microscopy and 77% when corrected by PCR. The specificity of the HRP2-based test was 71% when compared with microscopy and 88% when corrected by PCRBased on the high PPV and NPV, HRP2-based RDTs are likely to be the best diagnostic choice for areas with medium-to-high malaria transmission rates in Africa.
