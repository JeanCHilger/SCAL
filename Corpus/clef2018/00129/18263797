Growth differentiation factor-15 for prognostic assessment of patients with acute pulmonary embolism. Growth differentiation factor (GDF)-15 is a cytokine induced in the heart after ischemia or pressure overload. Circulating levels of GDF-15 provide independent prognostic information in patients with acute coronary syndromes or heart failure.We investigated the prognostic value of GDF-15 in acute pulmonary embolism.In a prospective cohort study, plasma levels of GDF-15 were determined by immunoradiometric assay in 123 consecutive patients with confirmed acute pulmonary embolism.GDF-15 concentrations on admission ranged from 553 to 47,274 ng/L 101 patients (82%) had GDF-15 levels above the upper limit of normal (1,200 ng/L). Patients who experienced pulmonary embolism-related complications during the first 30 days had higher baseline levels of GDF-15 (median, 6,039 [25th to 75th percentiles, 2,778 to 19,772] ng/L) compared with those with an uncomplicated course (median, 2,036 [25th to 75th percentiles, 1,279 to 3,176] ng/LGDF-15 is a promising new biomarker for risk stratification of pulmonary embolism.
