Current investigations and treatment of Burkitt's lymphoma in Africa. We reviewed the scientific literature on Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) in Africa in order to provide information on the current status of clinical care and the existing research challenges. BL epidemiology led to the discovery of the Epstein Barr virus, an important cause of several viral illnesses and malignancies. The incidence of BL has increased in the endemic areas of Africa, overlapping with the epidemic of HIV and increase of malaria. The impact of this on the clinical care of BL in the region is therefore of interest, especially in HIV-infected children. Rapid methods must be developed which enable the correct diagnosis to be made. It is important to improve supportive care to allow fairly aggressive treatment, to research into salvage therapy for those who fail first-line treatment, and to develop less toxic drug combinations for HIV-infected patients. Documentation of HIV status through counselling should be offered to all patients.
