Antibody response of humans to the circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium vivax. We studied the interaction of sera from residents of an area in northern Peru where vivax malaria is endemic with four recombinant DNA-derived circumsporozoite (CS) proteins of Plasmodium vivax. The antigens used in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay included one Escherichia coli-produced and three Saccharomyces cerevisiae-produced recombinant proteins. Three of the proteins (NS1(81)V20, Vivax-1, and Vivax-2) contain the entire central repeat region of the P. vivax CS protein, and one protein (Vivax-3) contains only two repeat sequences. Vivax-1, Vivax-2, and Vivax-3 contain different lengths of sequences flanking the repeats. A higher percentage of the sera had antibodies to Vivax-2 and Vivax-3, the two proteins containing the longest nonrepeat sequences, than to NS1(81)V20 or Vivax-1. Children less than 5 years of age did not have immunoglobulin G antibodies to NS1(81)V20 however, they had antibodies to Vivax-1, Vivax-2, and Vivax-3. The finding that individuals living in a malaria-endemic area produce antibodies to peptides containing nonrepeat regions of the CS protein emphasizes the need to characterize the immune response to these regions in naturally exposed and experimentally immunized humans.
