Venothromboembolism. This article focuses on the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of veno-thromboembolism, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), from the perspective of the emergency physician. The discussion is divided into two sections: DVT and PE. Because veno-thromboembolism is a continuum, certain aspects, such as background, incidence, the use of D dimer, and anticoagulation of both DVT and PE, are discussed together. Heavier emphasis is placed on topics germane to the emergency physician, and considerations for special populations are reviewed.
