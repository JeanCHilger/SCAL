The etiology and prognostic significance of cardiac troponin I elevation in unselected emergency department patients. Cardiac troponin elevations are associated not only with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) but also with multiple other cardiac and non-cardiac conditions.To investigate the etiology and clinical significance of cardiac troponin I elevations in an unselected Emergency Department (ED) patient cohort.The study population consisted of 991 consecutive troponin-positive patients admitted to the ED of a university hospital with ACS as the presumptive diagnosis. Cardiac troponin I was measured on admission and a follow-up sample was obtained at 6-12 h. Clinical diagnosis was ascertained retrospectively using all the available information including electrocardiogram, clinical data, laboratory tests, and available coronary angiograms.At admission, 805 (81.2%) patients were already troponin positive of these, the troponin elevation was related to myocardial infarction (MI) in 654 (81.2%) patients. Finally, 83.0% of the troponin elevations were due to MI, 7.9% were related to other cardiac causes, and 9.1% to non-cardiac diseases. The leading non-cardiac causes were pulmonary embolism, renal failure, pneumonia, and sepsis. Non-cardiac patients with elevated troponin I at admission showed significantly higher in-hospital mortality (26.7% vs. 13.4%, p = 0.002) compared to cardiac patients.Elevated troponin levels for reasons other than MI are common in the ED and are a marker of poor in-hospital prognosis.
