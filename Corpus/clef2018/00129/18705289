Approach to patients with pulmonary embolism in a surgical intensive care unit. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a potentially life threatening disease. Clinical signs and symptoms allow the clinician to determine the pretest probability of someone having pulmonary embolism but are insufficient to diagnose or rule out the condition. This paper aims to study the clinical presentation, identify the risk factors and evaluate the diagnostic strategies and management of patients with PE.The medical files of 69 patients were searched, who were diagnosed with PE and who were admitted to the Surgical Care Unit.Dyspnea, pleuritic pain, haemoptysis, fever and cough were the most common presenting symptoms. Risk factors for PE were found in 90% of cases. D-dimers assay was elevated in all cases (100%) and the other diagnostic strategies used showed great accuracy in confirming the pretest probabilities of PE. It is of high importance that 75% of the patients had deep vein thrombosis as assessed by venous ultrasonography. Mortality due to PE was approximately 6.9%.PE can be often overlooked with hazardous consequences. Clinical evaluation in combination with spiral CT or lung scintigraphy and vein ultrasound and D-dimer level can establish the diagnosis in the majority of patients so that effective treatment to be started as soon as possible.
