Prothrombin fragment 1 + 2, thrombin-antithrombin III complexes and D-dimers in acute deep vein thrombosis: effects of heparin treatment. Plasma levels of prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F 1 + 2), of thrombin-antithrombin III complexes (TAT) and of D-dimers were evaluated at several time intervals in 15 patients affected by acute proximal deep vein thrombosis, complicated or not by pulmonary embolism, and treated by conventional heparin therapy for 9 d. The mean levels of the three markers remained significantly increased throughout the period of observation, except for F 1 + 2 on day 9, when compared to normal values established in a population of normal healthy blood donors. However, whereas heparin significantly decreased the plasma levels of F 1 + 2 and of TAT complexes in less than 3 d. D-dimer levels were not significantly altered. Significant correlations were observed between the plasma levels of the three markers but they were not correlated to the actual intensity of heparin treatment evaluated as the activated partial thromboplastin time prolongation. These results indicate that heparin improves the hypercoagulable state associated with a deep vein thrombosis within the first days of treatment as indicated by TAT and F 1 + 2. They also account for the performances of D-dimer assay for the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis in patients already receiving heparin, a common situation in routine hospital practice.
