Advanced glycation end products in pregnancies complicated with diabetes mellitus or preeclampsia. Preeclampsia (PE) and diabetes mellitus (DM) are associated with oxidative stress. DM is complicated with formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which are associated with oxidative stress. We hypothesized that elevated serum AGE would be found in pregnancies complicated by PE or DM.Circulating AGEs, 8-isoprostane, vitamin E, and antioxidant capacity were analyzed from study patients.Serum AGE was elevated both in patients with type 1 DM and gestational DM, but not in PE, compared with controls. 8-isoprostane was elevated in patients with type 1 DM and PE compared with controls.AGEs and 8-isoprostane are not elevated in parallel in pregnancies complicated with PE or DM, suggesting biological heterogeneity.
