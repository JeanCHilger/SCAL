Performance of OptiMAL-IT compared to microscopy, for malaria detection in Burkina Faso. To compare the performance of OptiMAL-IT, a rapid diagnostic test for malaria, with that of microscopy in Burkina Faso.Finger-prick blood samples of 464 children attending hospital for suspected malaria were tested for malaria by microscopy and OptiMAL-IT.The sensitivity and specificity of OptiMAL-IT were 98.7% (CI 95% = 97.6-99.8) and 96.2% (CI 95% = 94.3-98.1) respectively, with a high positive likelihood ratio (25.97).OptiMAL-IT can be considered a good method to diagnose malaria in Burkina Faso, particularly in remote areas with little or no access to microscopy services.
