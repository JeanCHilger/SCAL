Current issues in the diagnosis and management of deep vein thrombosis. The diagnosis and management of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is of high importance given that a DVT can progress to a life threatening pulmonary embolism (PE) if undetected. At the same time the treatment of DVT involves anticoagulation which can lead to fatal complications and hence accurate evaluation methods are needed to diagnose or rule out DVT. Diagnosis of DVT has evolved recently with the introduction of clinical prediction rules combined with d-dimer and compression ultrasonography (CUS). Multidetector CT venography and MR venography have been used for the conformation of the diagnosis. Therapy of DVT has also evolved with the introduction of new anticoagulant agents. However much research needs to be done in regard to factors affecting recurrence and the duration of anticoagulation.
