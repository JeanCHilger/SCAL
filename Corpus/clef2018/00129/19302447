Risk stratification and outcomes in hemodynamically stable patients with acute pulmonary embolism: a prospective, multicentre, cohort study with three months of follow-up. The role of risk stratification in normotensive patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is still unclear.We evaluated, in these patients, the usefulness of six prognostic markers for predicting in-hospital adverse events related to PE and 3-month mortality.Two hundred and one consecutive patients with confirmed acute PE and normal blood pressure, who were administered conventional anticoagulation, were recruited in a multicentre prospective cohort study with 3 months of follow-up. At baseline, they received a comprehensive risk-evaluation including echocardiographic assessment of right ventricular dysfunction, determination of troponin I, brain natriuretic peptide and D-dimer, arterial blood gas analysis and a clinical score. Primary outcome of the study was PE-related in-hospital death or clinical deterioration. Secondary outcomes were in-hospital and 3-month all-cause mortality.The primary outcome occurred in one patient (0.5%), who died from PE during hospitalization. The in-hospital and 3-month all-cause mortality were 2% and 9%, respectively. None of the prognostic markers was predictive of the primary outcome. Clinical score, troponin I and hypoxemia predicted in-hospital all-cause mortality (P = 0.02, 0.01 and < 0.01, respectively). Clinical score (HR, 4.7 95% CI, 1.9-12.0), D-dimer (4.8We did not find prognostic markers useful as predictors of in-hospital PE-related adverse events. Clinical score, troponin I and hypoxemia predicted in-hospital all-cause mortality. Clinical score and troponin I independently predicted 3-month all-cause mortality.
