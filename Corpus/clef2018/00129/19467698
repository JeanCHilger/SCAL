Diagnosis and management of venous thromboembolism: Results of a survey on current clinical practice. The implementation of evidence from clinical studies into daily clinical practice is not a straightforward process. We developed a standardized questionnaire to explore clinical practice patterns in the management of VTE, in particular about the use of pre-clinical probability and D-dimer testing and on the home treatment of pulmonary embolism (PE).The standardized questionnaire was sent to all 394 physician members of the Italian Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (SISET) by e-mail. The questionnaire contained three groups of questions: about general information, about the diagnostic process for both deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and PE, and about home-therapy of PE.One hundred and twenty-eight (32.5%) physicians responded the questionnaire. For DVT diagnosis 69 (54.3%) physicians answered that they always use the D-dimer test 4 (3.1%) do never use itThe diagnostic approach to VTE among expert physicians appears to be heterogeneous in particular there is no widespread use of clinical prediction rules. The majority of expert physicians appear to consider the possibility of treating at home patients with PE.
