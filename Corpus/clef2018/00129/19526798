Chinese drugs for supplementing Qi and activating blood circulation in preventing deep venous thrombosis after big operations in orthopaedics and traumatology. To evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of the Chinese drugs for supplementing Qi and activating blood circulation in preventing DVT after big operations in orthopaedics and traumatology and observe the change of D-dimer before and after treatment.Seventy patients ranging in age from 39 to 94 years who were treated by big operations in orthopaedics and traumatology were divided into two groups randomly. Traditional Chinese medinine (TCM) group (group A) and western medicine group (group B). On the 2rd day after operation d-dimer was tested from both groups and the patients in group A were given one dose of TCM every day and the patients in group B were subcutaneously injected low-molecular-weight heparins calcium (LMWH). On the 8th after operation d-dimer was tested again from both groups. The parameters, such as the incidence of DVT and pulmonary thromboembolism, bleeding condition, were evaluated respectively.The D-dimer decreased in group A and had significant difference (P < 0.05), group B had no significant difference, there was also no significant difference between two groups. DVT was found in 1 patient in group B (1/35). Petechiae were found in 10 patients in group A (10/35) and in 26 patients in group A (26/35), which had significant difference (P < 0.05).Both the Chinese drugs and anti-coagulation drug can prevent the incidence of DVT effectively, and Chinese herbs are feasible in the prevention of DVT.
