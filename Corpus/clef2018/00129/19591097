Methods of estimating concentration of the D-dimers used in venous thromboembolism diagnosis. D-dimers (DD) are final products of stabilized fibrin degradation process. Elevated level of DD indicates parallel activation of both coagulation and fibrinolysis. D-dimers play important role in the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. All diagnostic methods detecting DD are based on monoclonal antibodies. There are three basic techniques used to measure DD: latex agglutination, full blood agglutination and immunoenzymatic methods. Nowadays new methods based on in vivo detection of DD using antibodies labeled with technetium are under clinical evaluation.
