Therapeutic application of subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin in acute venous thrombosis. Fifty patients presenting with acute deep-vein thrombosis were randomized in a prospective, controlled study to determine the safety and efficacy of a treatment with low-molecular-weight (LMW) heparin compared with unfractionated heparin. LMW heparin (n = 24) was administered twice daily subcutaneously at a dose of 2 X 150 anti-Xa units/kg body weight, and unfractionated heparin (n = 26) was given intravenously by continuous infusion at a dose of 450 anti-Xa units/kg body weight daily for 10 days. Doses were adjusted to maintain peak anti-Xa levels between 0.5 and 1.0 anti-Xa units per milliliter. One patient in the unfractionated heparin group and 2 patients in the LMW heparin group suffered from bleeding complications. Two patients on LMW heparin and on unfractionated heparin had high evidence of pulmonary embolism based on defects on ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy. Control phlebography and duplex sonography demonstrated a significant improvement during both treatment regimens. Reperfusion of the deep-vein system was 70% with LMW heparin and 75% with unfractionated heparin. The anti-Xa levels were significantly higher in the LMW heparin group, and activated partial thromboplastin and thrombin clotting times were significantly higher in the group receiving unfractionated heparin. Thrombin-antithrombin III complexes and D-dimer concentration decreased during the treatment, but did not differ between the two regimens. At the end of the treatment period with LMW heparin, protein C and antithrombin III were significantly higher.
