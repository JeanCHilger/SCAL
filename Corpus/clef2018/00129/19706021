Maternal circulating TNF-alpha levels are highly correlated with IL-10 levels, but not IL-6 and IL-8 levels, in women with pre-eclampsia. Several lines of evidence have shown that maternal cytokine levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and IL-10 were altered in women with pre-eclampsia (PE) compared to those from normal pregnancies. In this study, we determined whether these cytokine levels are correlated before and after delivery in patients with PE.Venous blood was obtained from 50 women diagnosed with severe PE at the time of admission and 24 hr after delivery. Plasma concentrations for TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 were measured by ELISA.There were no statistical differences for maternal levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 before and 24 hr postpartum. TNF-alpha and IL-10, but not IL-6 and IL-8, levels were significantly correlated before and 24 hr after delivery: TNF-alpha: y = 19.963 + 0.953*x r(2) = 0.924The correlation patterns of TNF-alpha with IL-10 and TNF-alpha with IL-6 and IL-8 suggest disparity in functional regulations between these cytokines in maternal circulation in PE.
