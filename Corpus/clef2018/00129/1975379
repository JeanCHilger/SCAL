Prevalence of antibody to heterologous circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium vivax in Thailand. The distribution in Thailand of antibody to a recently discovered variant of circumsporozoite proteins of Plasmodium vivax was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The ELISA capture antigens were a synthetic peptide of the principal variant sequence ANGAGNQPG and a candidate P vivax vaccine that contained the predominant repeat sequence GDRAA/DGQPA. Serological evidence of recent inoculation with the variant was found throughout Thailand and in migrants from Cambodia, Malaysia, and Burma. IgG antibody to the two P vivax circumsporozoite proteins was detected in 217 of 804 test sera (27%). Within the regions studied the proportion of positive sera specific for the variant epitope ranged from 28% to 66%. A vaccine against the predominant repeat domain may rapidly select for the variant, which already appears to be widespread within Thailand.
