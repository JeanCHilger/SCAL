Risk stratification of patients with pulmonary embolism based on pulse rate and D-dimer concentration. To enable outpatient treatment of a selected group of patients with pulmonary embolism (PE), insight in the determinants of adverse clinical outcome is warranted. We have identified risk factors for serious adverse events (SAE) within the first 10 days of acute PE. We have retrospectively analysed data of 440 consecutive patients with acute PE. Collected data included age, gender, medical history, blood pressure, pulse rate and D-dimer concentration. The variables associated with SAE in the first 10 days in univariate analysis (p<0.15) have been included in a multivariate logistic regression model (backward conditional, p out >0.10). In 440 patients with acute PE, 20 SAEs occurred in a 10-day follow-up period. Pulse rate > or = 100 beats per minute (bpm) (OR, 6.85 95%CI 1.43-32.81) and D-dimer concentration > or = 3,000 microg/ml (OR, 5.51
