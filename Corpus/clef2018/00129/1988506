Safety and immunogenicity of a genetically engineered human immunodeficiency virus vaccine. A phase 1 trial of a candidate human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vaccine was done in 25 healthy seronegative subjects. The antigen, env2-3 (SF2), was a nonglycosylated polypeptide representing the gp120 region of the env gene of the HIV-1(SF2) isolate. It was produced in genetically engineered yeast as a denatured molecule incapable of binding CD4. A synthetic lipophilic muramyl tripeptide (MTP-PE) was used as an adjuvant. Ten subjects received adjuvant alone and 15 received 50- or 250-micrograms doses of env2-3 (SF2) administered intramuscularly in two immunization regimens. In general, adjuvant and vaccine were well tolerated. Antibody responses to both the homologous antigen, env2-3 (SF2), and antigens from other highly divergent HIV isolates were elicited in the majority of vaccine recipients. However, antibody titers were low, without neutralizing activity. In 9 of 11 subjects who received the complete vaccine immunization series, a significant specific T lymphocyte response was observed.
