Diagnostic assessment of perioperative thromboembolism. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism is a frequent complication in postoperative setting. Despite advances in the diagnostic options conformation or exclusion of VTE remains a challenge. Preoperative assessment of thromboembolic risk factors may be helpful in estimating postoperative thromboembolic risk. Laboratory markers such as D-Dimer provide only limited information as they are modified by surgical intervention. Venous ultrasonography seems in postoperative setting a wide applicable diagnostic tool. However limited interpretation may be caused by bandage or oedema. Contrast venography und CT pulmonary angiography may be limited due to the nephrotoxic side effects of contrast agents especially in multimorbid patients. The development in magnetic resonance technology may overwhelm such problems. However magnetic implantates may also limit this modern diagnostic tool.
