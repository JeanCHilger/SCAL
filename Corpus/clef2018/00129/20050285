Evaluation of D-dimer in outpatients: clinical value and specific features. D-dimer as an activation marker of coagulation and fibrinolysis is a recognized diagnostic criterion of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary thromboembolism, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. In recent years, this laboratory test has been most frequently used for other purposes: to detect the activation of coagulation, to predict the course of diseases, and to determine the duration of anticoagulant therapy. Our investigation examined 1514 D-dimer measurements in 1370 outpatients without acute abnormalities, including 72 patients receiving warfarin and 32 patients after myocardial revascularization. 36.1% of cases were found to have values of more than 0.5 mkg/ml. Adequate anticoagulant therapy (INR 2-3) caused a reduction in the level of D-dimer that is an important additional laboratory test for the evaluation of antithrombotic defense. Further investigations are needed to determine cutoff values for various clinical situations.
