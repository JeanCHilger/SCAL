Phlebothrombosis of the leg. Diagnostic algorithm and therapeutic implications. Thromboses in the lower extremities are common. Non-invasive examination techniques, such as compression sonography and color-coded duplex sonography, have a high sensitivity and specificity. Relevant complications are in particular post-thrombotic syndrome and pulmonary arterial embolisms. The gold standard in treatment of phlebothrombosis of the leg is immediate anticoagulation therapy and compression treatment with early mobilization whereas lysis therapy, operative thrombectomy or implantation of cava filters are indicated only in isolated cases.
