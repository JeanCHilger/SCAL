Future developments in chest pain diagnosis and management. Much of the focus of research on patients with chest pain is directed at technological advances in the diagnosis and management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), pulmonary embolism (PE), and acute aortic dissection (AAD), despite there being no significant difference at 4 years as regards mortality, ongoing chest pain, and quality of life between patients presenting to the emergency department with noncardiac chest pain and those with cardiac chest pain. This article examines future developments in the diagnosis and management of patients with suspected ACS, PE, AAD, gastrointestinal disease, and musculoskeletal chest pain.
