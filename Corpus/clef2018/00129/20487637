Pulmonary embolism with minimal D-dimer increase - disagreement between clinic and laboratory: case report. Pulmonary embolism is still currently considered a very insidious disease and if not diagnosed and treated rapidly is lethal in almost 10 percent of all cases. Clinical and patient history data are essential for the diagnosis and evaluation of the clinical risk of pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary embolism, particularly during minor episodes, was primarily identified by abnormalities in D-dimer concentration during laboratory testing. Indeed, an increase in D-dimer plasma levels was consequently identified as a valid diagnostic element for pulmonary embolism and therefore, in the absence of D-dimer abnormalities, a tendency to exclude such diagnosis exists. This case report describes the importance of carrying out level II diagnostic investigations which may be particularly valid in patients with a minimal rise in D-dimer levels and a clinical suspicion of a pulmonary embolism. This method allows for a quick diagnosis with early therapeutic measures which improve survival rates during the acute and critical phase.
