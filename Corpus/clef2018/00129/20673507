The changes of blood coagulation in surgical patients with lung cancer. Patients with malignant tumor are at high risk of thrombophilia, which contributes to thromboembolism. Surgical treatment is one of the critical risk factors. In this study, changes and clinical significances of blood coagulation of lung cancer patients pre- and post operation were investigated.A prospective, controlled study were carried out in 74 lung disease patients, who were divided into lung cancer group and benign lung disease group. In each group, pre- and postoperative changes in prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APT), platelet count (PLT), D-dimer (D-D) and fibrinogen (Fib) and clinical performances were observed and compared in intra- and intergroups.The concentration of Fib both in lung cancer group and its subgroup (adenocarcinoma of lung) increased, preoperative differences between benign lung disease group and subgroup (squamous cell carcinoma of lung) was significant (P < 0.05). PT (postoperative 1st to 7th day) in lung cancer group prolonged, APTT (postoperative 3rd to 7th day) reduced, Fib (postoperative 3rd to 7th day) and D-D (postoperative 1st to 7th day) increased, PLT reduced on the 1st, 3rd day but then increased on the 5th, 7th day after operation, the difference between pre- and post-operation was significant (P < 0.05). D-D and PT in lung cancer group on the 7th day was longer than in benign lung disease group (P < 0.05). One pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) case in lung cancer group occurred, while in benign lung disease group none venous thromboembolism (VTE) appeared.Patients with lung cancer are in high hypercoagulable state, and prone to VTE. It is necessary to take some interventions to avoid VTE.
