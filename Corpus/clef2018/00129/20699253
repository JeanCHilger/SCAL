The value of serum procalcitonin in differential diagnosis of pulmonary embolism and community-acquired pneumonia. Presence of high fever may cause confusion in differential diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) versus pneumonia. The aim of this study is to investigate the diagnostic value of serum procalcitonin (PCT) in differential diagnosis of PE and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). A total of 24 patients with proven PE and 22 patients with CAP were included in the study. The study population was subdivided as PE patients with fever (group 1, n = 8) and without fever (group 2, n = 16) and CAP (group 3, n = 22). Serum PCT and systemic inflammatory markers were measured at the initial diagnosis and the third day of the treatment. The relation of PCT level with the other systemic inflammatory markers was investigated in each measurement point. The initial mean serum PCT level in group 3 (2.24 ± 0.99 ng/mL) was statistically higher than group 1 (0.48 ± 0.77 ng/mL) and group 2 (0.14 ± 0.17 ng/mL
