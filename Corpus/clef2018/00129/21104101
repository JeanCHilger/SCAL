Asymmetric septal hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: a case report. We report the case of a 30-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with the chief complaint of syncope. She also described intermittent chest pain and exertional dyspnea over the past several weeks. Review of systems and laboratory findings including D: -dimer levels were noncontributory. EKG demonstrated right bundle branch block. Nongated chest CT with contrast was ordered to exclude the possibility of pulmonary embolism demonstrating markedly asymmetric septal thickening. Suspicion for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was raised, which was subsequently confirmed on gated cardiac MRI.
