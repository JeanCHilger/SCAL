Deep vein thrombosis: review and update. Deep vein thrombosis is a common and serious medical condition, which frequently complicates the postoperative recovery of surgical patients with recognised/unrecognised risk factors. The pathophysiology of formation of blood clots in veins of lower extremities has now come in light after development of newer investigations. Newer imaging techniques allow the evaluation of peripheral venous system, which was previously unavailable. Pulmonary embolism remains the major early complication of deep vein thrombosis, although postphlebitic syndrome and recurrent deep vein thrombosis are other major complications. The risk of both pulmonary embolism and postphlebitic syndrome escalates in patients with recurrent deep vein thrombosis. Thus a correct evaluation of patients at high risk and proper management is mandatory. With the development of low molecular weight heparin, the incidence of postheparin bleeding has been reduced.
