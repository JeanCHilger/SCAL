Effect of lipoxin A₄ on IL-1β production of monocytes and its possible mechanism in severe preeclampsia. This study examined in vitro effect of lipoxin A(4) (LXA(4)) on interleukin-1β (IL-1β) production of monocytes and its possible mechanism in severe preeclampsia (PE). Peripheral venous blood was drawn from 15 patients with severe preeclampsia (PE group) and 20 normal pregnant women (control group) to prepare monocytes which were then treated with LXA(4) at different concentrations of 0, 10, 100 nmol/L respectively. IL-1β level in the supernatant of monocytes was detected by enzyme linked immunoassay. The [Ca(2+)](i) of monocytes was measured by laser scanning confocal microscopy. The results showed that the IL-1β level and the [Ca(2+)](i) of monocytes in the PE group were significantly higher than those in the control group. LXA(4) significantly decreased the generation of IL-1β in a dose-dependent manner in the PE group. After treatment with 100-nmol/L LXA(4), in the PE group, the [Ca(2+)](i) concentration of monocytes was significantly reduced. It was concluded that LXA(4) may inhibit the IL-1β production of monocytes from severe preeclampsia women by inhibiting extracellular calcium influx.
