PP13 as a marker of pre-eclampsia: A two platform comparison study. To evaluate the role of PP13 as a marker for pre-eclampsia (PE) by comparing two different immunoassay platforms.In this case-control study, first-trimester serum samples from 195 normal pregnancies and 37 pregnancies with PE were analysed for PP13 by using a manual DTL ELISA and the AutoDELFIA(®) platform.Levels of PP13 in first-trimester pregnancies increased with gestational age in controls and pre-eclampsia cases using both methods of analysis, but at different rates. PP13 levels were decreased in women with PE. Levels of the marker are found to be more reduced in PE cases when measured using the DTL ELISA compared to AutoDELFIA(®).Further studies are needed to compare the performance of the DTL ELISA and the AutoDELFIA(®) PP13 assays in terms of reproducibility, robustness and clinical performance in predicting pre-eclampsia.
