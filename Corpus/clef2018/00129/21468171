The value of blood D-dimer test in the diagnosis of walk-in patients with venous thromboembolism. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) and related pulmonary thromboembolism are life-threatening diseases that require efficient diagnosis and clinical management. While the diagnosis and treatment of VTE in hospitalized patients has been extensively studied, less has been reported on walk-in patients with VTE. Here we report on four outpatients with VTE that were efficiently diagnosed using the blood D-dimer test and successfully treated.
