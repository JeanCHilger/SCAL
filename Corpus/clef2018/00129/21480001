Natriuretic peptide type-B can be a marker of reperfusion in patients with pulmonary thromboembolism subjected to invasive treatment. This study was intended to investigate changes in cardiac biomarkers and pulmonary hemodynamic effects of invasive treatment in patients with intermediate-risk (hemodynamic stability with evidence of right ventricle dysfunction and/or myocardial injury) pulmonary embolism. Also, to also evaluate if natriuretic peptide type-B (NT-proBNP) plasma levels are associated with right ventricle function and pulmonary arterial pressures. Interventional study: Fourteen normotensive adult patients with acute and radiologically massive pulmonary embolism plus positive biomarkers and evidences of right ventricle dysfunction underwent invasive pulmonary angiography for invasive treatment consisting on mechanical thrombus fragmentation and catheter-directed intrathrombus thrombolysis. Angiography was repeated after 12-24 h to reevaluate perfusion status. Plasma biomarkers were monitored before and 8-h after intervention. Biomarkers were initially elevated in all patients. Eleven patients (78.6%) exhibited significant angiographic reperfusion. NT-proBNP and mean pulmonary arterial pressure decreased significantly in all of them [3693 (1803, 8862) to 1951 (1309, 7918) pg/ml P = 0.008) and 40.0 (24.0, 46.0) to 22.0 (14.0, 27.0) mmHg
