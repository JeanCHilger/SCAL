Update on diagnosis and treatment of high-risk pulmonary embolism. High-risk pulmonary embolism (PE) is associated with a significant early mortality, approaching 25%, and is defined by the presence of cardiogenic shock.The high early mortality rate for patients with shock requires a rapid diagnostic approach with bedside tests. Right ventricular dilatation assessed by echocardiography in patients with a high clinical probability for PE confirms the diagnosis without the need for additional testing. Spiral CT pulmonary angiography remains the first line investigation for patients without shock. Anticoagulant treatment should be started as soon as pulmonary embolism is suspected. Fibrinolytic therapy is recommended for patients with high-risk pulmonary embolism. The prognostic value of cardiac biomarkers, such as B natriuretic peptide, troponins and right ventricular dilatation for early mortality has been demonstrated. These markers permit the identification of an intermediate risk group of patients with normotensive pulmonary embolism and prognostic scores have been developed.It remains to be established whether fibrinolysis can have a clinical benefit or reduce mortality in patients with intermediate risk pulmonary embolism. A large randomised placebo-controlled study is currently under way to answer this question. Further studies will more clearly define the role of various predictive rules to identify patients requiring hospital care or those who should be considered for outpatient management.
