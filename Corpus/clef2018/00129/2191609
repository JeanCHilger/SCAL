Determination of fibrinopeptide A (FpA): comparison of an enzymatic method and isotopic method with reference to ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy. Fibrinopeptide A becomes free after thrombolysis of fibrinogen in thrombo-embolic situation. In view to quantify this molecule, the authors have compared two different methodologies (enzymatic and isotopic). Isotopic scintigraphy of lung (ventilation-perfusion) served as reference in this study for pulmonary thrombosis.
