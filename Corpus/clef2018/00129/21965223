Pulmonary embolism: CT signs and cardiac biomarkers for predicting right ventricular dysfunction. The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the accuracy of quantitative cardiac computed tomography (CT) parameters and two cardiac biomarkers (N-terminal-pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) and troponin I), alone and in combination, for predicting right ventricular dysfunction (RVD) in patients with acute pulmonary embolism. 557 consecutive patients with suspected pulmonary embolism underwent pulmonary CT angiography. Patients with pulmonary embolism also underwent echocardiography and NT-pro-BNP/troponin I serum level measurements. Three different CT measurements were obtained (right ventricular (RV)/left ventricular (LV)(axial), RV/LV(4-CH) and RV/LV(volume)). CT measurements and NT-pro-BNP/troponin I serum levels were correlated with RVD at echocardiography. 77 patients with RVD showed significantly higher RV/LV ratios and NT-pro-BNP/troponin I levels compared to those without RVD (RV/LV(axial) 1.68 ± 0.84 versus 1.00 ± 0.21 RV/LV(4-CH) 1.52 ± 0.45 versus 1.01 ± 0.21
