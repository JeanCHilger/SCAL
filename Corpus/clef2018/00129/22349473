Cardiac biomarkers in the critically ill. Cardiac biomarkers in intensive care medicine are an excellent complement to existing clinical and diagnostic information in specific diseases. Due to their lack of specificity, the diagnostic properties of common cardiac biomarkers, such as natriuretic peptides and cardiac troponins, remain ambiguous, while their prognostic value has already been proven. In addition, there are several promising new biomarkers that might contribute to a "multimarker strategy" in the critically ill patient in the future, but further evaluation is still required.
