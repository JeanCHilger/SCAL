Vascular endothelial growth factor and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 in lung adenocarcinoma with malignant pleural effusion: correlations with patient survival and pleural effusion control. The mechanisms by which vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) contribute to lung cancer growth have not been fully elucidated. This study aimed to assess the role of VEGF and sICAM-1 in control of pleural effusions (PE) and survival in patients with primary human lung adenocarcinoma. Using enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay, the concentrations of VEGF and sICAM-1 were measured in pleural effusions and serum from a total of 79 lung adenocarcinoma patients with malignant pleural effusions (MPE) and 24 patients with tuberculosis. Data were correlated with the efficacy of MPE control and survival. Compared to patients with tuberculosis, the levels of VEGF and sICAM-1 in both PE and serum were significantly higher in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Statistically significant correlation was observed between PE VEGF levels and MPE control. PE VEGFâ‰¥2760 pg/ml was used as a cut-off point for failure to MPE control (odds ratio=7.06 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.40-20.78
