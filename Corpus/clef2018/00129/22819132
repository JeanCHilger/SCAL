Benefit of combining quantitative cardiac CT parameters with troponin I for predicting right ventricular dysfunction and adverse clinical events in patients with acute pulmonary embolism. To prospectively evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of quantitative cardiac CT parameters alone and in combination with troponin I for the assessment of right ventricular dysfunction (RVD) and adverse clinical events in patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE).This prospective study had institutional review board approval and was HIPAA compliant. In total 83 patients with confirmed PE underwent echocardiography and troponin I serum level measurements within 24 h. Three established cardiac CT measurements for the assessment of RVD were obtained (RV/LVaxial, RV/LV4-CH, and RV/LVvolume). CT measurements and troponin I serum levels were correlated with RVD found on echocardiography and adverse clinical events according to Management Strategies and Prognosis in Pulmonary Embolism Trial-3 (MAPPET-3 criteria. 31 of 83 patients with PE had RVD on echocardiography and 39 of 83 patients had adverse clinical events. A RV/LVvolume ratio>1.43 showed the highest area under the curve (AUC) (0.65) for the prediction of adverse clinical events when compared to RV/LVaxial, RV/LV4Ch and troponin I. The AUC for the detection of RVD of RV/LVaxial, RV/LV4Ch, RV/LVvolume, and troponin I were 0.86, 0.86, 0.92, and 0.69, respectively. Combination of RV/LVaxial, RV/LV4Ch, RV/LVvolume with troponin I increased the AUC to 0.87, 0.87 and 0.93, respectively.A combination of cardiac CT parameters and troponin I measurements improves the diagnostic accuracy for detecting RVD and predicting adverse clinical events if compared to either test alone.
