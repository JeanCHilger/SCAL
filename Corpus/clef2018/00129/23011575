A simple score for rapid risk assessment of non-high-risk pulmonary embolism. We tested whether bedside testing for H-FABP is, alone or integrated in combination models, useful for rapid risk stratification of non-high-risk PE.We prospectively studied 136 normotensive patients with confirmed PE. H-FABP was determined using a qualitative bedside-test showing a positive result for plasma concentration >7 ng/ml.Overall, 11 patients (8.1 %) had an adverse 30-day outcome. Of 58 patients (42.6 %) with a positive H-FABP bedside-test, 9 (15.5 %) had an unfavourable course compared to 2 of 78 patients (2.6 %) with a negative test result (p = 0.009). Logistic regression analysis indicated a sevenfold increased risk for an adverse outcome (95 % CI, 1.45-33.67 p = 0.016) for patients with a positive H-FABP bedside-test. Additive prognostic information were obtained by a novel score including the H-FABP bedside-test (1.5 points), tachycardia (2 points), and syncope (1.5 points) (OR 11.57 [2.38-56.24]Bedside testing for H-FABP appears a useful tool for immediate risk stratification of non-high-risk patients with acute PE, who may be at increased risk of an adverse outcome, in particular if integrated in a novel score without the need of echocardiographic examination.
