Thrombolysis in acute pulmonary thromboembolism.  Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common clinical condition with presentations that may vary from asymptomatic subsegmental emboli to massive vascular obstruction and shock with high risk of death. Identifying patients at highest risk for death is critical to select those who would benefit most from thrombolytic therapy. New and evolving clinical prediction models, serum tests, and imaging modalities are being used to improve our ability to identify potential thrombolytic candidates. We review the evolution of the present guidelines on the management of PE, specifically regarding the evolving role of thrombolytics outcomes following thrombolytic therapy, including mortality, hemorrhage, hemodynamic improvement, and prevention of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension
