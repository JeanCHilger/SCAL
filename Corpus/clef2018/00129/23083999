Alterations of maternal plasma HTRA1 level in preeclampsia complicated by IUGR. We evaluated the presence of HtrA1 in maternal plasma of normal pregnancies and of pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia (PE) without and with Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR). We demonstrate that HtrA1 maternal plasma levels show significant different concentrations in first, second and third trimester of gestation and that HtrA1 concentration increases in maternal plasma of gestations complicated by PE with IUGR compared with control maternal plasma matched for gestational age. Based on these data high maternal plasma levels of HtrA1 could be considered as a possible marker of an occurring IUGR in preeclamptic women.
