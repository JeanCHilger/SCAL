Promoter hypomethylation of TIMP3 is associated with pre-eclampsia in a Chinese population. A study by Yuen RK, Penaherrera MS, von Dadelszen P, McFadden DE, Robinson WP. DNA methylation profiling of human placentas reveals promoter hypomethylation of multiple genes in early-onset preeclampsia. Eur J Hum Genet 201018:1006-1012 based on a Canadian population found the tissue inhibitor of the metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP3) gene to be hypomethylated in pre-eclampsia (PE) placentas and to be a potential prenatal marker for early onset PE. To further explore the role of TIMP3 in PE and to investigate whether the TIMP3 promoter shows the same methylation pattern in the Han Chinese population, we analyzed a complete methylation assay of TIMP3 including the promoter region studied in the Canadian report and the neighboring CpG island in placentas (cases n = 41, controls n = 22) maternal peripheral blood (cases n = 3
