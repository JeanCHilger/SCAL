Interleukin-17A is involved in bacteria-related acute pleural inflammation. The role of pro-inflammatory interleukin-17A (IL-17A), in pleural diseases is unknown. We sought to investigate IL-17A expression and its clinical implications in patients with pleural effusion (PE) and IL-17A involvement in the pathobiology of pleural inflammation elicited by bacterial products.Pleural and blood IL-17A content was examined in 84 patients with PE of different aetiologies, and the diagnostic value of pleural IL-17A was explored in 92 patients with neutrophil-predominant PE. IL-17A contribution in pleural inflammation was evaluated in mice injected intrapleurally with either IL-17A or bacterial products with or without IL-17A-neutralizing antibodies.IL-17A was upregulated in the pleural space of patients with parapneumonic PE. It was detected in a minority of patients with tuberculous PE and very uncommonly in patients with malignant or other pleural exudates. Pleural fluid (PF) IL-17A levels were correlated with markers of acute pleural inflammation, as well as vascular endothelial growth factor and IL-8 levels. Among patients with neutrophil-predominant PE, PF IL-17A was detected only in those with parapneumonic PE, although the sensitivity of the test was low (<50%). Intrapleural injection of IL-17A elicited a neutrophil-predominant inflammatory response in mice, and IL-17A neutralization partially blocked pleural neutrophilia induced by intrapleural administration of bacterial products.IL-17A is involved in pleural inflammation related to bacterial infection. Moreover, pleural IL-17A levels may be helpful in uncovering an infectious aetiology among patients with neutrophil-predominant PE.
