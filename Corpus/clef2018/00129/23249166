Evaluation of soluble mesothelin-related peptide as a diagnostic marker of malignant pleural mesothelioma effusions: its contribution to cytology. Soluble mesothelin-related peptide (SMRP) is regarded as an FDA approved biomarker for the diagnosis and monitoring of pleural malignant mesothelioma (MPM). We detected the SMRP levels in pleural effusions (PE) by means of an ELISA and analyzed their diagnostic relevance to differentiate MPM from benign pathology and from non-MPM pleural metastasis. Comparison with cytology in MPM-PE was also performed. We found that SMRP detection in MPM-PE can help the diagnosis of MPM and provide additional diagnostic value to cytology. We concluded that SMRP test may be incorporated into clinical practice of PE from patients suspicious for MPM.
