Immunoregulatory cytokines in mouse placental extracts inhibit in vitro osteoclast differentiation of murine macrophages. Previous studies showed that placental extracts (PE) alleviates arthritic symptoms in animal models of arthritis.To evaluate whether murine PEs obtained at embryonic days 7.5 (PE7) and 17.5 (PE18) regulate RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation, RAW 264.7 cells were cultured with RANKL and MCSF in presence or not of PEs. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) was stained and multinucleated TRAP positive cells were visualized under a light microscope. Cathepsin K and metalloprotease expression was assessed by RT-PCR and gelatin zymography respectively. NFATc1 expression was determined by immunoblot. To analyze NFAT-dependent transcription, macrophages were transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid. Cytokines were determined in PEs by ELISA and immunoblot. Transforming growth factor (TGF)- beta and Interleukin (IL)-10 receptor were inhibited in cell cultures with specific antibodies.PE7 and PE18 inhibited RANKL-induced multinucleated TRAP positive cells, Cathepsin K expression and metalloprotease activity, as well as NFATc1 expression and activity, thereby inhibiting osteoclast differentiation of RAW cells. Inflammatory/Regulatory cytokine ratio was higher in PE7 than in PE18. Blocking TGF-beta abolished the effect of both, PE7 and PE18, on multinucleated TRAP positive cells and metalloprotease expression, whereas blocking IL-10 receptor reverted the effect of PE18 but not of PE7.Inhibition of osteoclast differentiation by PEs was not unexpected, since cytokines detected in extracts were previously found to regulate osteoclast differentiation.PEs inhibited osteoclast differentiation of macrophages in vitro. Downregulation of NFATc1 might be involved in this effect. Regulatory/Th2 cytokines play a role in the effect of PEs on osteoclast differentiation.
