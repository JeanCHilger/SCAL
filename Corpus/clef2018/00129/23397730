Research of sapindus saponins on endothelial function in spontaneously hypertensive rats. To investigate the regulation on endothelial function of sapindus saponins in spontaneously hypertensive rats by studying the reactivity on different vasoconstrictor and dilator, and the content of the active substances.Forty 16-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats were randomly divided into five groups, one with placebo as model group, one with captopril tablets (27 mg x kg(-1)) as positive control, one with low-dose sapindus saponins (27 mg x kg(-1)), one with medium-dose (54 mg x kg(-1)), one with high-dose (108 mg x kg(-1)). And another eight healthy Wistar-Kyoto strain (WKY) rats were used as the normal group. The animals were treated for eight weeks, and the indicators to be detected were as follows: (1) the response of thoracic aorta on different vasoconstrictors Ang II (1 x 10(-9) -1 x 10(-5) mol x L(-1)), PE (1 x 10(-8) 1 x 10(-4) mol x L(-1)), KCl (20 -120 mmol x L(-1)) (2) the endothelium-dependent or non-endothelium-dependent vasodilation response of thoracic aorta on Ach (1 x 10-(10)-1 x 10(-5) mol x L(-1)) or SNP (1 x 10(-8)-1 x 10(-3) mol x (L(-1)In SHR model group, the response of thoracic aorta on Ang II, PE and KCl was increased, the endothelium-dependent vasodilation on Ach was reduced, but the effects on SNP was not obvious, the content of ET-1 and TXB2 was increased, and the content of NO and 6-KPG1alpha was reduced, Vs the normal control group, there were significant differences (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) in the treatment groups, the response of thoracic aorta on Ang II, PE and KCl was reduced, the endothelium-dependent vasodilation of thoracic aorta on Ach was improved, the content of ET-1 and TXB2 was reduced, and the content of NO and 6-KPG1alpha was increased, Vs the SHR model group, there were significant differences (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01).Our findings suggested that sapindus saponins protected the endothelial function in SHR, the mechanisms were relevant to the protection of endothelial function.
