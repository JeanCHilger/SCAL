Magnitude of D-dimer matters for diagnosing pulmonary embolus. The objective of this study is to determine whether the magnitude of the D-dimer correlates with a higher likelihood of pulmonary embolus (PE).We performed an electronic chart review at our academic, tertiary care center, annual emergency department (ED) census greater than 100000. All patients with a chest computed tomographic (CT) scan with intravenous contrast and an elevated D-dimer level obtained in the ED between January 2001 and July 2008 were identified. Specific, predetermined, predefined data elements including sex, age, D-dimer level, and final ED diagnosis were recorded by a hypothesis-blinded extractor using a preformatted data form. D-dimer level less than 0.58 μg/mL constitutes the normal laboratory reference range for our turbidometric D-dimer assay. Data were analyzed using standard statistical methods, and a linear regression analysis was performed for correlation analysis of D-dimer and diagnosis of PE.We identified 544 subjects who had both a chest CT scan performed and an elevated D-dimer level obtained in the ED. Fifty-eight subjects (10.7% mean D-dimer, 4.9 μg/mL) were diagnosed with PE, and 486 (89.3%Increasing magnitude of D-dimer correlates with increasing likelihood of PE diagnosed by CT angiography.
