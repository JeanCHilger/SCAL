Mesothelin is more useful in pleural effusion than in serum in the diagnosis of pleural mesothelioma. Soluble mesothelin-related peptide (SMRP) is regarded as a biomarker of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). Herein, we compared the diagnostic performances of SMRP in matched pleural effusion (PE-SMRP) and serum (S-SMRP).Diagnosis on pleural biopsies was performed for all patients including 43 with MPM, 23 with non-MPM pleural metastases (MTS) and 36 with benign (BNG) pleural diseases. SMRP was measured by a MesoMark ELISA (Cis-Bio International Gif/Yvette France).Using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, 12.70 and 1.08 nM were detected as cut-off values to optimal discrimination for PE-SMRP and S-SMRP, respectively. PE-SMRP showed a better diagnostic accuracy than S-SMRP in MPM vs. MTS+BNG (area under the ROC curve=81.6 vs. 70.5 sensitivity=69.8% vs. 46.5%PE-SMRP detection has a superior diagnostic accuracy than S-SMRP detection in the diagnosis of MPM.
