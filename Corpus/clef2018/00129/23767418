Common lung conditions: acute dyspnea. Dyspnea is a subjective experience of breathing discomfort patients experience qualitatively distinct sensations that vary in intensity. Acute dyspnea might be secondary to an acute problem, or it might be an exacerbation of an existing disease (eg, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure). It also accompanies a variety of illnesses at the end of life. New information has changed differentiation between respiratory and cardiovascular etiologies of acute dyspnea, as well as rapid diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Management of acute dyspnea from hypercapnic failure also has changed. Patients presenting with dyspnea most commonly have underlying cardiovascular and/or respiratory etiologies, and differentiating between the two can be challenging. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) are elevated when ventricular wall tension increases (eg, during a heart failure exacerbation). BNP and NT-proBNP are most useful for identifying patients with dyspnea who do not have heart failure. A BNP level less than 50 pg/mL has a negative predictive value of 96%, effectively ruling out heart failure
