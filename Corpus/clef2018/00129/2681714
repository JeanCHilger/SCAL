Plasmodium falciparum gametocyte formation in vitro: its stimulation by phorbol diesters and by 8-bromo cyclic adenosine monophosphate. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate increased the number of gametocytes by 50 to 100% in well or petri dish cultures of the HB-3 clone of Plasmodium falciparum. Phorbol dibutyrate had a similar effect. The optimal concentration for each of these agents was 20 ng/ml or approximately 30 nM. No effect of forskolin was found, other than a general inhibition of growth at concentrations over 10 microM. An inhibitor of phosphodiesterase, 8-bromo cyclic adenosine monophosphate (at concentrations of 0.1 and 1.0 microM) also significantly increased the number of gametocytes formed by this clone.
