Plasmodium-specific immunoglobulin E in sera from an area of holoendemic malaria. Serum samples obtained from adults living in an area of holoendemic malaria in Papua New Guinea and from control residents of Hawaii were tested for Plasmodium-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) E antibody by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Fifteen (33.3%) of the New Guinea sera had absorbance values indicative of seropositivity. Only half of the IgE-positive sera were concomitantly positive for antimalarial IgG antibody. All of the control sera were negative for antibody of both immunoglobulin classes.
