New prospects for the epidemiologic and immunologic study of malaria by the Western blotting technic. A new modification in western blotting technique now permits the analysis of micro samples of blood collected from inhabitants of malaria endemic areas using several different antigens of Plasmodium falciparum. Compared to Immuno Fluorescent Assay and to Immuno Enzymology, ELISA (using somatic antigens and exoantigens of P. falciparum) the western blotting method gives a more detailed analysis. It seems to open new prospects for seroepidemiological studies of human malaria and for the selection of antigenic fractions that may allow the preparation of a vaccine.
