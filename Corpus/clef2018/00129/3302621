Pulmonary fibrin deposition and increased microvascular permeability to protein following fibrin microembolism in dogs: a structure-function relationship. The effects of fibrin microembolism were examined using an infusion of a prothrombin activator (Echis carinatus venom, ECV 30 min, 0.5 NIH thrombin equivalent units/kg) in acute mongrel dogs prepared with a pulmonary lymph cannula (n = 6, 12.3-21.5 kg). Lymph flow increased approximately 2.5-fold after 1-1.5 hr of elevated left atrial pressure (Pla = 20 cm H2O
