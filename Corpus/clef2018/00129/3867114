Measurement of crosslinked fibrin derivatives in plasma and ascitic fluid with monoclonal antibodies against D dimer using EIA and latex test. D dimer and related crosslinked fibrin derivatives were measured in plasma of normal subjects and in patients with various disorders. In 23 healthy, young females low plasma levels were found (mean 47 ng/ml). In 12 patients with deep vein thrombosis, moderately elevated levels (mean 593 ng/ml) were seen. Higher levels were found in 6 patients with pulmonary embolism (mean 3,337 ng/ml). The highest values occurred in 4 patients with severe intravascular coagulation (31,000 to 390,000 ng/ml). In 22 patients with ovarian cancer and in 21 patients with other gynecologic carcinoma, normal to highly elevated levels of D dimer like material were found. These values corresponded well to concentrations of tumor marker CA 125, measured in the same samples, and to tumor activities staged in these patients based on clinical examinations. Very high values of crosslinked fibrin derivatives (75,000-525,000 ng/ml) were determined in ascitic fluid of patients with ovarian cancer.
