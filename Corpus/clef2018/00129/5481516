Serum fibrin-fibrinogen degradation products associated with postoperative pulmonary embolus and venous thrombosis. A total of 76 "high-risk" surgical patients were studied for evidence of venous thromboembolic disease. Episodes of deep vein thrombosis and of pulmonary embolism were related to changes in blood levels of fibrin degradation products (F.D.P.). When diagnosed either by ordinary clinical means or by venography and isotope scanning significantly raised F.D.P. levels were found in all cases. Serum F.D.P. estimations are unlikely to help in detecting deep vein thrombosis, but may prove valuable in diagnosing pulmonary embolism.
