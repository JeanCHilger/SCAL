Detection of fibrinolytic split products in patient collections with disordered hemostasis. I. In pathologically verified lung cancer. II. In thrombotic/embolic occurrences. 56 patients afflicted with pathologically-histologically ensured carcinoma of the lungs and bronchial system as well as 15 patients with thrombotic/embolic processes under streptokinase therapy were examined for defects in their coagulation system and for fibrinogen split products by using methods of reptilase time (RPZ) and staphylococcal clumping test (SCT). 1. Quantitatively more split products could be identified in patients after surgery and in those without any specific therapy than in patients under irradiation and chemotherapy. 2. With growing tumour expansion a more and more diminishing fibrinolytic activity could be observed in all therapy forms. 3. After initiating cytostatic chemotherapy with adriamycin, the highly molecular split products X and Y increasingly appeared at the initial stage. They disappeared with progressing therapy. 4. Under streptokinase therapy a characteristic redistribution of the FSP-pool from predominantly highly molecular fragments at the initial stage to lower molecular ones could be observed with falling SCT values and constant RPZ after approximately 48 hours.
