Comparison of various serological test results using antigens from different strains of Plasmodium falciparum. Suitability of different strains of Plasmodium falciparum grown continuously in vitro was compared using the indirect haemagglutination (IHA) the indirect immunofluorescent (IFA) tests and ELISA. In the tests employing soluble antigens (IHA and ELISA), there was a significant higher mean log titer of the same sera tested against different strains. Ranking of the strains in term of sensitivity for the detection of malaria antibody in people in the endemic area were G-112 = SO = CC greater than SU greater than PS in the IHA test and G-112 = SO greater than CC greater than SU greater than PS in the ELISA. The difference in the mean log titers appear to relate neither to the geographical location not the isoenzyme markers tested. There was also an apparent correlation between the results of the IHA and the IFA test but not between these two tests and ELISA.
