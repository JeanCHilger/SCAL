Pulmonary artery thromboembolism: its clinical and coagulative diagnosis. A total of 250 subjects were investigated using a diagnostic search flow-chart. Pulmonary artery thromboembolism (PATE) was diagnosed in 102 patients. The results have demonstrated the value of laboratory tests employed--markers of thrombin- and plasminemia and platelet activation--for PATE diagnosis. To diagnose PATE, levels of fibrinogen-fibrin and beta-thromboglobulin degradation products should be measured in myocardial infarction patients, and plasma soluble fibrin measurement should be added to those in patients with circulatory insufficiency. In recurrent PATE, continuous increase of plasma beta-thromboglobulin and soluble fibrin levels, antithrombin III exhaustion and reduced levels of fibrinogen-fibrin degradation products are of diagnostic value.
