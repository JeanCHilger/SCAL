Use of purified antigens in the serodiagnosis and epidemiologic studies of human malaria. Importance of the ELISA technic for determining specific IgG and IgM. A purified antigen was isolated from the red blood cells of Saimiri sciureus which was experimentally infected by Plasmodium falciparum. An enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) was carried out thanks to this antigen. The results obtained with the test were evaluated from two series of sera: one coming from an endemic area, the other taken out of it. The results were compared with those obtained with indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) which is considerated as reference test. There is a good correlation between the two tests when anti-IgG conjugate is used for ELISA but there is no correlation with anti-IgM conjugate. One of the advantages of the ELISA, is that it allows a separate evaluation of specific IgG and IgM. Consequently distinction between recent and past infection would be possible. This may be useful for estimating the efficiency of an antimalaric campaign.
