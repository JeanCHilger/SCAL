Thrombotic complications originating in the lung in chronic respiratory insufficiency. 34 patients, died of chronic respiratory insufficiency, as a result of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), are the subject of clinical-anatomical analysis. In 18 (53 +/- 17%) of them could be found thromboembolic complications more often developed as subacute or chronic intravascular coagulation, but evident changes could not be always met in the clotting system. The most characteristic feature is the raising of fibrin-degradation products and the reduction of antithrombin III. The necessity of dynamic trace of coagulation and haemorrheological data in patients with COPD in the stage of heavy chronic respiratory insufficiency is emphasized.
