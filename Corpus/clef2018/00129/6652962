Studies on the specificity of anti-erythrocyte antibodies in the serum of patients with malaria. Sera from patients with Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax or P. ovale malaria were selected according to their high levels of antibodies against human erythrocyte membranes as measured in a microELISA. The specificity of the anti-erythrocyte antibodies in these sera and two normal sera was investigated by means of an immunoblotting technique in combination with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All the patients' sera as well as the control sera contained antibodies against several erythrocyte polypeptides. As compared with normal sera, most malaria sera showed elevated levels of antibodies against polypeptides of 80K, 70K, 40K and 28K molecular weights. Two sera reacted strongly against a polypeptide with an electrophoretic mobility similar to the alpha subunit of spectrin. One serum showed strong reaction and several other sera, including normal sera, showed weak reaction against a 45K molecular weight polypeptide corresponding to actin. No pervading differences were seen in the pattern of specificities of the anti-erythrocyte ghost antibodies between sera from patients with P. falciparum, P. vivax or P. ovale infections.
