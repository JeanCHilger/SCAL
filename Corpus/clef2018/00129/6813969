Thrombocytopenia in preeclampsia and eclampsia. 1. The lack of a general agreement on the definition of PE makes the interpretation of laboratory findings in different series of these patients difficult. 2. Thrombocytopenia is the most common hemostatic abnormality in patients with PE and is caused by platelet consumption. 3. There is little concrete evidence that thrombin mediates the thrombocytopenia in most of these patients. 4. Immune mechanisms or severe vasospasm with resultant endothelial damage may contribute to the thrombocytopenia in some patients.
