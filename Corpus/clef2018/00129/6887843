The transfer test: a new screening procedure for thrombotic diseases. The transfer test (TT) measures by means of thromboelastography the capacity of a plasma to shorten the coagulation time of a control plasma. The value of the TT was compared to that of fibrin(ogen), degradation products (FDP), and ethanol gelatin test (EGT) in various diseases (group I), in confirmed deep venous thrombosis (group II), and in confirmed pulmonary embolism (group III). In 211 consecutive patients admitted for various diseases the results of the TT, FDP, and EGT were abnormal in 12.3, 11.3, and 66.6%, respectively, of the cases. In 59 consecutive patients with deep venous thrombosis confirmed by radiological phlebography the results of TT, FDP, and EGT were abnormal at admission time in 96.6, 89.8, and 44%, respectively, of the cases. In 45 consecutive patients with pulmonary embolism confirmed by lung scintigraphy the results of TT, FDP, and EGT were abnormal at admission time in 97.7, 97.6, and 88%, respectively, of the cases. Among the three parameters which were evaluated, the TT seems to be the most sensitive screening procedure for thrombotic diseases. A normal result of TT is a strong argument against a recent thrombotic venous phenomenon.
