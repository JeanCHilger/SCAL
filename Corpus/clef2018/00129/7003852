The development and validation of an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay for malaria. ELISA has been evaluated and validated for malaria. It is sensitive, specific and reproducible. A comparison of ELISA and IFAT has been made, and there is a good correlation between the two tests. ELISA results can be assessed objectively. A small study on Caucasians with clinical malaria shows the value of ELISA as an immunodiagnostic tool. Its seroepidemiological value is also demonstrated, since it quickly reflects the changes in malaria transmission after a WHO malaria control programme in a malaria endemic area.
