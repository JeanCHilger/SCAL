Fibrinogen/fibrin degradation products in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in critically ill patients. The concentration of fibrinogen/fibrin degradation products (FDP/fdp) was measured using a direct latex agglutination tests in 40 critically ill patients with pulmonary arteriography and possible acute pulmonary embolism. All of them were admitted with signs of severe heart and/or respiratory insufficiency, and 12 (30%) of the patients required mechanical ventilation. The concentration of FDP/fdp was significantly higher in 28 of 29 patients with positive arteriography (mean 145 microgram/ml), that in those whose arteriography was negative (in every cases the FDP/fdp level was lower than 10 microgram/ml). To help differentiate pulmonary embolism from other acute heart or pulmonary diseases, the authors measured the FDP/fdp in 10 patients with bacterial pneumonia, 24 patients with acute myocardial infarction, 4 patients with extrinsic asthma, and 18 normal control subjects. The authors found high levels of FDP/fdp (more than 10 microgram/ml) in only 2 patients with pneumonia and in 6 with myocardial infarction. In no case was the level of FDP/fdp higher than 40 microgram/ml. On the other hand, in patients with pulmonary embolism, 23 (79%) had levels higher than 40 microgram/ml. The study indicates that this test is a helpful screening method for pulmonary embolism, especially in situations where other emergency diagnosis tests are inconclusive or impractical it also provides justification for beginning anticoagulant therapy and for recommending pulmonary arteriography.
