Increased activated protein C-protein C inhibitor complex levels in patients with pulmonary embolism. Activated protein C (APC)-protein C inhibitor (PCI) complex level was examined in 35 patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) and in 20 healthy volunteers. Thrombin-antithrombin III complex, plasmin alpha 2 plasmin inhibitor complex, and fibrin-D-dimer levels were significantly increased in the patients with PE compared to levels in healthy volunteers. Levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-I, tissue type plasminogen activator, and von Willebrand factor antigens were also significantly increased in patients with PE. Plasma level of APC-PCI complex was increased in most patients with PE and APC-alpha 1 antitrypsin complex level was increased in 13 patients. These complexes were not detected in healthy volunteers. These findings suggested that plasma protein C was activated in patients with PE, and that PCI was the major inhibitor of APC generated in this condition. Thus, regulation of the protein C pathway might play an important role in the pathogenesis of PE.
