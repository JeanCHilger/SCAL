Detection of CD62P (GMP-140) on peripheral blood platelet membrane in various heart diseases. The protein CD62P expressed on platelet surface membrane was measured by flow cytometry to evaluate its clinical significance. Whole blood contained 0.32% citrate from 64 patients with heart disease and 30 healthy adults were fixed with 0.1% paraformaldehyde. To 50 microliters of the fixed blood, 10 microliters of CD62 PE (Becton Dickinson) was added. After standing for 20 minutes at room temperature, the samples were washed and suspended in 1ml of PBS. Platelets were analyzed with Spectrum III (Ortho) flow cytometer. In healthy control, the percentage of platelets positive for anti-CD62P was 0.16 +/- 0.20 (mean +/- SD)%. Abnormal levels of CD62P were observed in 5 patients with unstable angina, 6 patients with acute myocardial infarction, 1 patient with old myocardial infarction, and 2 patients with mitral stenosis. These results show that activated platelets may play some roles in pathogenesis of heart disease though it is not fully clear yet.
