Intensive care management of multiple-organ dysfunction due to falciparum malaria in a married couple. A married couple presented simultaneously with malignant tertian malaria and rapidly developed septicaemia and severe multiple-system organ failure. Despite schizonticidal treatment and multisystem support in intensive care the husband died. The selection of chemoprophylactic agents for this couple was not ideal and the duration of therapy before exposure to risk was inadequate. Severe infection with plasmodium falciparum is life-threatening and requires early diagnosis. It is best managed in an intensive care unit where continuous assessment may enable rapid detection of clinical deterioration and allow appropriate treatment to be instituted. The diagnosis should be considered in symptomatic patients who have travelled through areas where malaria is endemic. Recognised guidelines for the prescription of malarial chemoprophylaxis should be followed to ensure adequate protection.
