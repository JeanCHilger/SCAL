The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay "ELISA" developed in recent years represents a significant addition to existing serological tools. Encouraging preliminary results obtained through its application to a number of parasitic diseases during the last two years indicate the value of further investigations and trials which will permit a true evaluation.Although the technique is easy to perform and quite sensitive, there are certain problems to be solved before it becomes widely usable. In the present Memorandum the technical details are given and the advantages and shortcomings of the procedure are discussed. Present applications and future prospects are reviewed.
