Suppression of thrombolysis in a canine model of pulmonary embolism. The brisk fibrinolytic response of canines has impaired efforts to develop a canine model of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Difficulties in retaining chronic embolic residuals were partially overcome by administration of tranexamic acid (TXA) (Circulation. 199183:1272-1279.). In this study, we used type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), a major inhibitor of the endogenous fibrinolytic system, to determine its efficacy in the suppression of thrombolysis in canines.Thrombus was induced in the inferior vena cava of anesthetized mongrel dogs with thrombin and a special double-balloon catheter 2 hours later, the thrombus was embolized. In one group of dogs, activated type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) (130 micrograms) was delivered directly into the forming thrombusIntravenous TXA and intrathrombus PAI-1 effectively suppress thrombolysis for 24 hours in canines. Thromboemboli enriched with PAI-1 appear to resist lysis for longer periods of time (up to 1 week). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that PAI-1 remains associated with the embolus, where it continues to inhibit lysis, whereas TXA eventually diffuses out of the embolus, allowing lysis to ensue.
