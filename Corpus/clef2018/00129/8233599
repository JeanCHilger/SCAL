Population dynamics of human malaria parasites. Highly sensitive detection and identification of the four Plasmodium species infecting man, and the characterization of P. falciparum isolates, have been achieved by PCR amplification. The results obtained from field and laboratory studies are described. The significance of these observations to the design and interpretation of epidemiological investigations is discussed.Populations in malaria-endemic regions are often subject to infection by more than one of the four human Plasmodium species, each of which comprises a number of strains.  Plasmodium species and their strains exhibit distinct clinical, immunological, and biological behavior.  The malaria situation at a given locality therefore reflects the composition of the parasite population, which is known to vary geographically.  Practical and standard methods to accurately define the parasite population are, however, currently unavailable.  Although microscopic examination is ideal for the rapid diagnosis of disease, it cannot detect the low parasite levels observed throughout chronic malaria infection, nor does it allow unequivocal identification of the parasite species in the mosquito.  Current methods for characterizing a parasite line require relatively large quantities of parasite material, obtained only through in vitro culture.  This procedure is exacting and expensive, applicable only to P. falciparum parasites.  The author reports findings from work on the development of practical and sensitive methods for the detection and characterization of human malaria parasites.  DNA amplification by the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was chosen as the basis for the methods.  Results from field and laboratory studies are discussed along with the significance of the observations to the design and interpretation of epidemiological investigations.
