Investigations into the biochemical basis of neuromodulation by 2-phenylethylamine: effect on microtubule protein. In order to understand the role of 2-phenylethylamine (PE) on neuronal responses, membrane changes have been studied using ESR probes. We report that the anticipated change in lipid membrane fluidity generally implicated in signal transduction has not been observed when PE is added to synaptosomes. As cytoskeletal architecture of presynaptic terminals appears to be involved in synaptic transmission, we non-specifically labeled synaptosomal membrane proteins with the sulfhydryl spin probe N-(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidine-1-oxyl-4-yl) maleimide (4-MAL-TEMPO). The addition of 2-phenylethylamine was found to induce conformational changes, in decreasing the ratio of weakly to strongly immobilized spin label (W/S) to 65% of the control. Of the membrane proteins labeled, 70-90% of the 4-MAL-TEMPO is covalently incorporated into cytoskeletal proteins. In isolated synaptosomes, incorporated with spin-labeled tubulin, the addition of PE reduced the W/S ratio to 51.6% of that obtained for polymerized microtubules. In vitro, PE reduced tau R of polymerized microtubules by 37%. We propose that the PE interaction with tubulin changes microtubule dynamics which may lead to its neuromodulatory action. The state of microtubular assembly can modulate the responsiveness of second messengers in the cell to the effect of stimulatory agents. The nature and physiological significance of PE interaction with tubulin is currently under investigation.
