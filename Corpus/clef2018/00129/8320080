Effect of verapamil on the IL-2 binding to its active receptor and on the release of IL-2 receptor by activated PBMC. In the present study we have examined the effect of a Ca2+ channel blocker (verapamil) on the binding of IL-2 to its biologically active receptor (IL-2R), as well as on the release of its soluble form (sIL-2R) by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) stimulated by a variety of stimuli. In the same culture systems, cyclosporine A (CsA) was also used as an additional dissecting tool. PHA and the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 enhanced both the percentage of PBMC binding phycoerythrin-conjugated IL-2 (PE-IL-2) and the mean fluorescence intensity of this binding. A phorbol-ester (PMA), on the other hand, enhanced only slightly the proportion of PE-IL-2 binding cells. The two stimulatory combinations (PHA/PMA and A23187/PMA) also up-regulated the proportion of PE-IL-2 binding cells and the fluorescence intensity the PHA/PMA combination was the most potent of all stimuli used. These two stimulatory combinations, and PHA alone, were also associated with maximal in vitro release of sIL-2R. Verapamil significantly down-regulated PE-IL-2 binding in all culture systems and it convincingly inhibited the release of sIL-2R. Furthermore, this mode of action of verapamil was concentration-dependent. CsA, on the other hand, inhibited the binding of PE-IL-2 to all stimulant-activated PBMC and had only a slight inhibitory effect on the in vitro release of sIL-2R. Our results indicate that there is a correlation between the binding of IL-2 to biologically active receptors on the surface of stimulant-activated PBMC and the release of the soluble form of IL-2R by the same cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
