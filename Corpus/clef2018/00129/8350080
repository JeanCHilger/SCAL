Bloodfeeding behavior of Anopheles gambiae s.l. and Anopheles funestus in Kilifi District, Kenya. Blood meal samples were tested by ELISA for 534 Anopheles gambiae s.l. and 76 Anopheles funestus collected from 25 sites in Kilifi District, Kenya. Human IgG was detected in 94.4% of the An. gambiae s.l. and in 90.8% of the An. funestus. No samples were positive for cow and only a few were positive for goat. Both species fed predominantly on humans irrespective of host availability. At these sites on the Kenyan coast, the high degree of human-feeding by malaria vectors contributes to the efficiency of malaria parasite transmission and the high incidence of severe malaria.
