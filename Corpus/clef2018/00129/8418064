A prospective study of the association between the human humoral immune response to Plasmodium falciparum blood stage antigen gp190 and control of malarial infections. The human humoral immune response to the Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface antigen gp190 was analyzed to determine the rate of reinfection by the parasite and the ability to control parasite density. The prospective study was carried out in a West African village where malaria is hyperendemic. No correlation between the antibody titers and protection against infection was observed within the group of children. Positive and negative associations of antibody specificities with protection against and/or control of parasitemia were, however, found for adolescents and adults, respectively. Thus, in adolescents, the presence of antibodies to gp190 fragment M6 correlates with a 50% reduced risk of P. falciparum infection and an increased ability to control parasitemia, whereas in adults, the humoral response to some of the polymorphic regions of gp190 associates with an increased risk of infection.
