Circulating stable antigens at higher levels down-regulate antibody responses to Plasmodium falciparum. A study involving 169 schoolchildren (5-14 years old) living in Manarintsoa near Antananarivo (Madagascar, East Africa) was performed during the seasonal malaria transmission period. For the whole population examined, the prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum and the rates of spleen enlargement and of circulating stable antigen (S-Ag) were found to be 60.9%, 71.7%, and 46.8%, respectively. The prevalence of IgG antibody to RESA (ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen) was 42.7% and that of IgG and IgM antibodies to E-Ag (exoantigens) was 44.9% and 2.9%, respectively. The positive rates for IgG and IgM antibodies to Som-Ag (somatic antigen) were 48.5% and 5.9%, respectively. Concerning S-Ag, no significant relationship was observed for parasitemia, spleen size, age, or IgM antibody responses to exoantigens (E-Ag) or to somatic antigen (Som-Ag). Levels of S-Ag were found to be related to IgG antibodies to E-Ag. Our results suggest that S-Ag at low levels may participate in the mechanisms involved in the development of the IgG antibody responses to E-Ag and to Som-Ag, whereas at a comparative population level, higher quantities of S-Ag down-regulate antibody responses to P. falciparum. The data we obtained were compared with those gathered in another malaria mesoendemic area (Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, West Africa), where lower levels of S-Ag were found.
