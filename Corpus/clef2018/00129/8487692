D-dimer in the early diagnosis of thromboembolic disease in acute spinal injuries. The role of monitoring plasma levels of D-dimer (XDP) as a diagnostic aid for thromboembolic disease was investigated in 267 patients admitted for acute care to the Prince Henry Hospital Spinal Unit. Elevated plasma XDP levels were found in 103 patients (39%) and a diagnosis of thromboembolic disease was made in 33. Thromboembolic disease was not found in patients whose XDP levels remained normal.
