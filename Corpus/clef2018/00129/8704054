In vivo interference of heparin bolus injection with photometric continuous lipase determination. The new photometric lipase determinations use diacylglycerols as substrates in a micellar solution, whereas the turbidimetric method is based on emulsified triacylglycerols degradation. Extrahepatic lipoprotein lipase, which is well known to be liberated by heparin from the capillar binding sites, may cleave triacylglycerols as well as diacylglycerols. When a heparin bolus injection is given to a patient, the released lipoprotein lipase renders high lipase activities in blood misleading for a pancreatic disorder.
