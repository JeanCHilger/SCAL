Diagnosis of malaria in Africa using the Parasight F test. The purpose of this study which was carried out in the Central African Republic between January and February 1994 was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Parasight F test in diagnosing malaria in the indigenous population. Comparison of test results in a series of 62 malaria suspects who had been residing in the country for more than 10 years and 67 malaria suspects who had been living abroad showed significant differences but the overall value of the test was satisfactory. The test was specific for Plasmodium falciparum. In-field trials showed that the test could be used effectively by paramedics and community health care workers. Basing the decision to perform antimalarial treatment in semi-immune subjects with suspected malarial solely on the results of the Parasight F test would have led to unwarranted non-treatment in 10% of cases. Presumptive treatment of malaria is justified. The Parasight F test allows identification of Plasmodium falciparum and adaptation of therapy if required by the spread of chemoresistance.
