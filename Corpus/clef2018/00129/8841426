Expression of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta 1), -beta 2, and- beta 3 by cultured human prostate cells. Transforming growth factor beta s (TGF beta s) are members of a superfamily of polypeptides that control cell cycle progression and a variety of other cellular activities. TGF beta family members, -beta 1, -beta 2, and -beta 3, have been identified in prostate. The levels of expression of these TGF beta isotypes have been reported to vary with the pathologic state of the prostate. While the significance of these observations remains to be elucidated there is little doubt that TGF beta s play an important role in controlling growth of the prostate. The prostatic cells expressing TGF beta s have not been identified. This information would provide insight into the physiologic role of TGF beta s and suggest ways that growth control may be altered in prostate disease. We used stromal (PS) and epithelial (PE) cells, cultured from normal human prostate and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), to study the effect of TGF beta s on cell proliferation and TGF beta transcript and protein expression. The proliferation of PS and PE was inhibited by pM quantities of TGF beta 1, -beta 2, and -beta 3. Both cell types expressed transcripts for all three TGF beta isotypes, but PS primarily secreted TGF beta 1, whereas PE secreted more TGF beta 2 than TGF beta 1. These observations suggest that TGF beta s are antiproliferative agents in vivo, and that the stroma is the source of TGF beta 1 while the epithelium is the major source of TGF beta 2 in prostate. There were no significant differences in the growth response to TGF beta s, the TGF beta-isotype expressed, or the amount of TGF beta secreted by cells cultured from normal prostate or BPH.
