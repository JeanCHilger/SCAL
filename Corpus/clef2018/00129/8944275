Features of recrudescent chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum infections confer a survival advantage on parasites and have implications for disease control. This paper reports on the features of recrudescent infections of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum (CQRPf) malaria from a study in vivo of patients from a malaria endemic (n = 527) and non-endemic (n = 129) region of Sri Lanka where the incidence of RI resistance was 30% and 55%, respectively. In both groups of patients, the recrudescent infections which emerged after treatment of the primary infection with chloroquine (CQ) and primaquine had significantly lower peripheral parasitaemia (0.036% and 0.108% in endemic and non-endemic patients, respectively) compared to their primary infections (mean parasitaemia 0.13% and 0.49% P = 0.021 and 0.002, respectively). The recrudescences of CQ resistant infections also gave rise to clinical disease of markedly reduced severity (average clinical scores of 10.1 and 8.2) compared to their primary infections (average clinical scores of 12.4 and 12.3
