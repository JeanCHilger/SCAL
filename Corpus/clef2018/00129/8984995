Cerebral malaria and AIDS: case report. Although it has not been definitely proven that the severity of malaria is associated to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) we know that infection through Plasmodium falciparum can favor a rapid evolution of the HIV infection. Besides, association of malaria with HIV/AIDS from a clinical point of view can be clinically severe in the face of the occurrence of other microorganisms or neoplasias, which worsens the evolution and prognosis of the affected patients. The concurrence of HIV with Plasmodium in malaria endemic zones is a possibility which should always be taken into consideration, since transmission is related to risk factors caused by people's behavior which are not always promptly revealed and/or identified. The authors report one case of brain malaria infection by Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum in a patient with AIDS. They describe the clinical evolution and therapy.
