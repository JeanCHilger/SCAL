Falciparum malaria with acute liver failure. Falciparum malaria occasionally presents with encephalopathy, jaundice and fever mimicking fulminant hepatic failure.We recently managed seven cases (mean age 34 years, range 20-45 all men) of acute falciparum malaria presenting with a short history [mean duration 8.1 (4-15) days] of fever, jaundice, altered sensorium and oliguria. Only one patient had splenomegaly. Investigations revealed jaundice (bilirubin 1.9-30.7 mg/dl), moderate to severe anaemia (Hb 4-8 gm/dl), increased liver enzymes (2-4 times normal) and azotaemia (serum creatinine 1.6-7.4 mg/dl). Coagulation parameters were deranged in 3 with clinical bleeding in two cases. One patient without a past history of diabetes had increased blood glucose values with ketonuria. HBsAg was negative in all cases. Patients received supportive therapy along with intravenous quinine. Peritoneal dialysis was done in one patient. Three patients showed rapid recovery and four succumbed to the disease. Post-mortem liver biopsy showed Kupffer cell hyperplasia, pigment deposition, foci of steatosis and necrosis along with submassive necrosis in one case.In areas endemic for malaria, awareness of this entity is a must. In a patient with jaundice and altered sensorium, disproportionate anaemia, azotaemia and only mild elevation of liver enzymes should help differentiate these patients from cases of fulminant hepatic failure. The diagnosis can be confirmed by peripheral blood examination. Early institution of specific therapy may be the only life saving measure in these patients.
