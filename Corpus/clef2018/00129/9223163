Association between anti-Pfs48/45 reactivity and P. falciparum transmission-blocking activity in sera from Cameroon. Pfs48/45, a sexual stage parasite protein doublet of P. falciparum, is a target of antibodies which inhibit the development of the parasite in the mosquito. Twenty-eight (54%) out of 52 sera of gametocyte carriers from Cameroon reduced infectivity in the mosquito membrane feeding bioassay to less than 20% of the controls. These 52 sera were analysed by competition ELISAs for the presence of antibodies capable of competing the binding of six monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) directed against five different epitopes on Pfs48/45. The percentage of these 52 Cameroon sera that competed with one of the MoAbs ranged from 13% (epitope I) to 33% (epitope IIc). Comparison of activity in the transmission-blocking assay (> or = 80%) and in the Pfs48/45 competition ELISA show a relative specificity of 100% (24 of 24) and a relative sensitivity of 75% (21 of 28). Non-blocking sera showed no competition with any of the MoAbs. These MoAbs were further used to study the diversity of epitopes among isolates of P. falciparum using a two-site ELISA. MoAbs against epitope I, III and V reacted with four different isolates whereas epitope II could be subdivided into three epitopes. None of the isolates reacted with MoAb 3G12 (epitope IV). Using these four different isolates, the competition ELISA titre varies from 1/20 to 1/80 and no significant differences are found between the isolates except for epitope II where only three out of 11 positives for epitope IIa were also positive for epitope IIc.
