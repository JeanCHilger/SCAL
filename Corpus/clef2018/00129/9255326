Treatment of glomerulonephritis in microscopic polyangiitis and Churg-Strauss syndrome. Indications of plasma exchanges, Meta-analysis of 2 randomized studies on 140 patients, 32 with glomerulonephritis. Although plasma exchanges (PE) have no added benefit in the treatment of vasculitides of the polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) group with steroids (CS) +/- cyclophosphamide (CY), this has not been demonstrated in patients presenting with glomerulonephritis (GN). We therefore reanalyzed the records of microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) or Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS) patients presenting with GN.Patients were included consecutively in 2 randomized trials: a) comparing CS vs CS + PE (n = 78) and b) comparing CS + pulse CY +/- PE in PAN and CSS with factors of poor prognosis (n = 62) 9-12 PE/patient were performed.32 patients, 18 men and 14 women, presented with GN, 28 MPA and 4 CSS, mean age 53.2 +/- 17 years. Clinical/biological manifestations before treatment were comparable in both groups: weight loss 84.4%, fever 62.5%, mononeuritis multiplex 62.5%, purpura 28.1%, GI tract involvement 43.8%, arthritis 37.5%, asthma 12.5%, CNS manifestations 9.4% cardiac involvement 9.4%This study confirms that PE have no added benefit in the treatment of GN in MPA and CSS.
