Detection of trypanosomes in blood by the Quantitative Buffy Coat (QBC) technique: experimental evaluation. Microhematocrit centrifugation (Woo test) and miniature anion exchange are the most widely used techniques for routine detection of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense in endemic areas. The QBC technique developed for diagnosis of malaria has been successfully used for detection of trypanosoma in blood. The purpose of this laboratory study was to evaluate the end-point sensitivity of the QBC test in comparison with the Woo test. Decreasing concentrations from 15 x 10(5) to 15 trypanosomes/ml of human blood were tested using the two techniques. Sensitivity was calculated in function of reading time at each concentration. Results showed that the sensitivity of the QBC test was 95% down to a concentration of 450 trypanosomes/ml. In comparison 95% sensitivity of the Woo test was observed only down to 7500 trypanosomes/ml and reading time was twofold longer. These findings were reproducible for two hours after sample preparation but deterioration was rapid thereafter. Given its simplicity and sensitivity, QBC test would appear to be a suitable technique for in-field screening programs for human African trypanosomiasis.
