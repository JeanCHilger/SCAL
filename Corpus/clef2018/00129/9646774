Diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Diagnostic evaluation in the patient with suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) includes a clear correlation between clinical probability, test selection and test interpretation. Real-time B-mode ultrasound with color Doppler remains the imaging technique of choice in suspected DVT. The ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) lung scan is the preferred diagnostic modality in suspected PE. The D-dimer assay may be useful in excluding PA. New diagnostic techniques, including spiral computerized tomography may further modify the diagnostic algorithm.
