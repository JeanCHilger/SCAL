Immune response and lack of immune response to Plasmodium falciparum P126 antigen and its amino-terminal repeat in malaria-infected humans. A parasitophorous vacuole protein of Plasmodium falciparum, p126, is a potential candidate for a malaria vaccine. Its N-terminal region, composed of six repeats of eight amino acids, appears to be involved in the induction of protective immunity against P. falciparum challenge in monkeys. This study evaluated the immune response to p126 and to its N-terminal region (Nt47) in patients (n = 45) living in a malaria-endemic area of Brazil (Colina, Porto Velho, Rondonia). Cellular proliferative responses against Nt47 were low and infrequent. The study of the humoral immune response demonstrated that 95% of the patients had detectable anti-p126 antibodies and 77% had anti-Nt47 antibodies. Analysis of the antibody isotypes specific for Nt47 revealed that all four IgG subclasses were present and individuals with higher levels of anti-Nt47 cytophilic IgG antibody (IgG1 + IgG3/IgG2 + IgG4) had significantly lower parasitemia levels, suggesting that antibodies to the N-terminal region of the p126 protein may contribute to acquisition of immunity to P. falciparum malaria.
