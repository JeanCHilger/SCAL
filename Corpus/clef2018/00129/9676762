Lupus anticoagulant, high levels of anticardiolipin, and anti-beta2-glycoprotein I antibodies are associated with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. To evaluate the prevalence of lupus anticoagulant (LAC) and anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL), and that of anti-beta2- glycoprotein I (anti-beta2-GPI) and prothrombin antibodies in patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH).Fifty-four consecutive patients with PH were studied: 23 with primary, 20 secondary, and 11 chronic thromboembolic PH. LAC was diagnosed by screening and confirmatory coagulation tests, while aCL, anti-beta2-GPI, and prothrombin antibodies were measured by ELISA.Prevalence of aPL was higher in patients with chronic thromboembolic PH compared to the other 2 groups. The prevalence in chronic thromboembolic PH vs primary and secondary PH was: LAC 63.6 vs 13.0 and 10.0%, p < 0.001 aCL-IgG 54.5 vs 17.4 and 15.0%, p < 0.02The presence of LAC, moderate or high levels of aCL-IgG, or anti-beta2-GPI-IgG was strongly associated with that of chronic thromboembolic PH. These data are in agreement with the close relationship observed among these 3 variables and thromboembolism in patients with aPL.
