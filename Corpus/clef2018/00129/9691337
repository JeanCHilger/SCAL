ARDS in plasmodium vivax malaria. Acute renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, ARDS, hypoglycaemia, coma or epileptic seizures are manifestations of severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria. On the other hand, vivax malaria or benign tertian malaria is usually free from complications. In the present report we describe a case of acute tertian malaria with a severe and complicated course. In this situation bacterial coinfection should always be suspected and treated empirically with broad-spectrum antibiotics, until the results of cultures are available. Mixed plasmodial infection (P. vivax and P. falciparum) must be excluded by repeated and meticulous examination of blood smears. Newer techniques such as PCR processing or ParaSight F Test are mentioned.
