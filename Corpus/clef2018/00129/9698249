Chiral chromatographic method to determine the enantiomers of halofantrine and its main chiral desbutyl metabolite in erythrocytes. We describe a direct liquid chromatographic method with spectrofluorimetric detection to quantify the two enantiomers of halofantrine and the two enantiomers of its main chiral N-monodesbutylated metabolite in erythrocyte pellets. The method involves a Chiralpak AD column and a rapid one-step extraction procedure with acetonitrile. The method was validated for the four enantiomers within the range 0-1000 ng/ml. The absence of stereoconversion was studied in samples stored frozen for up to eight months. The optical rotation of the halofantrine and metabolite enantiomers was determined after separation on a semi-preparative Chiralcel OD column with polarimetric detection.
