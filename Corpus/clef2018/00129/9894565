Correlation between beta 2-glycoprotein antibodies and antiphospholipid antibodies in patients with reproductive failure. Antiphospholipid antibodies (APAs) are important in the etiology of reproductive failure. Studies have shown that binding proteins are necessary for the detection of APAs. One of these, beta 2-glycoprotein, has been shown to be necessary for detection of anticardiolipin antibodies. It is felt that some APAs may be directed to the binding protein itself, or to a combination of the binding protein and phospholipid.In this study, a comparison of APAs vs. anti beta 2-glycoprotein antibodies was performed on the sera of 123 women younger than 40 years of age with a history of reproductive failure. Antibodies to six phospholipid epitopes, cardiolipin, phosphatidyle-thanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidylserine, were measured.Of the 123 women tested, 33 had one or more positive immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibodies to phospholipids, of which 9 were to cardiolipin. However, only 1 of 123 women had IgG antibodies to beta 2-glycoprotein and she was APA negative. Thirty-eight of 123 women had one or more IgM antibodies to phospholipids, with none directed to cardiolipin IgM. In contrast, only 8 of the 123 women had IgM antibodies to beta 2-glycoprotein. Five of the eight patients had IgM APA 4 of 5 had IgM antibodies to PE, 1 to PI.There is no correlation between beta 2-glycoprotein antibodies and APA status in this population. To date, our most sensitive test for detecting phospholipid autoimmune-mediated in vitro fertilization failure still appears to be the ELISA assay for APA.
