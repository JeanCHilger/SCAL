Rapid DNA extraction for molecular epidemiological studies of malaria. DNA isolation from blood samples collected in molecular epidemiological studies is crucial for the quality and reproducibility of data. Blood samples from two malaria endemic sites have been prepared by four different DNA isolation methods with subsequent PCR amplification of the msp2 locus of Plasmodium falciparum. We tested a rapid boiling method the guanadine isothiocyanate DNA extraction
