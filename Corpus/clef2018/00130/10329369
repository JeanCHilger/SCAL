Plasmodium falciparum: membrane feeding assays and competition ELISAs for the measurement of transmission reduction in sera from Cameroon. The effect of natural malaria transmission-blocking factors in the blood of Plasmodium falciparum gametocyte carriers was assessed in two types of functional bioassays. In the direct membrane feeding assay (DMFA), a comparison is made between the infectivity of gametocytes from a naturally infected gametocyte carrier in the presence of autologous plasma and the infectivity in the presence of replacement plasma from nonimmune donors. In the standard membrane feeder assay (SMFA), cultured NF54 gametocytes are used to measure the capacity of endemic sera to block transmission. In the DMFA, 18 out of 48 sera (37.5%) from Cameroonian gametocyte carriers reduced transmission significantly, while in the SMFA 22 out of 48 sera (45.8%) produced transmission reduction. There was a positive correlation between both assays (r + 0.41, P < 0.05). Antibodies against epitopes of transmission-blocking target antigens Pfs48/45 and Pfs230 were measured in competition ELISAs and compared with the results of DMFA and SMFA. Serological reactivity in competition ELISAs against three epitopes of Pfs48/45 was significantly higher in the group of transmission-reducing sera in both the DMFA and the SMFA, especially for epitope III. No significant difference was found for Pfs230 antibodies (epitope I). Sensitivity of the serological assays was approximately 60%, with a specificity of around 70%. Serological tests cannot replace the functional bioassay in field situations as yet, but can contribute in the selection of sera for SMFA evaluation.
