Comparison of two techniques for detection of anti-Plasmodium falciparum antibodies: Falciparum-spot IF (Biomérieux) and Malaria IgG Celisa (BMD). Preliminary results. We compared a new Elisa assay to detect malaria antibodies: Malaria IgG Celisa (BMD) with the IFAT technique Falciparum-spot IF (Biomérieux): sensitivity, specificity, predictive positive and negative values were 81%, 99%, 95%, 95%, respectively. Eight patients had positive thick blood smear out of 23 performed. For these eight confirmed acute malaria cases, the Elisa assay was negative in five instances. For two recent malaria attacks both Elisa and IFI were negative. With blood donors, two sera were IFAT positive and Elisa negative 16 were IFAT doubtful and Elisa negative. Doubtful results rose up to 13.5% by IFAT against 1.5% by Elisa assay. We preferred kappa coefficient instead of chi 2 test for data analysis, which measures the concordance degree between the two techniques. Here concordance is moderate. Choosing an Elisa assay to detect the transmission of malaria for at-risk blood donors collides with the method sensitivity compared with IFAT as reference.
