Serological responses of Gambian children to immunization with the malaria vaccine SPf66. Antibody responses to the malaria vaccine SPf66 and to its constituent peptides were measured over a period of 2 years in Gambian children who had been immunized with SPf66 or with a control vaccine (inactivated polio vaccine). Three hundred and six of 308 children (99%) who had received three doses of SPf66 vaccine had antibodies to SPf66 at a level above that found in European controls who had not been exposed to malaria. Responses to the constituent peptides derived from 35.1, 55.1 and 83.1-kDa proteins were found in 88%, 97% and 97% of children, respectively 26% had an antibody response to the NANP repeat peptide of circumsporozoite protein which is also included in the SPf66 vaccine. A response to SPf66 was found in 22% of children who had received the control vaccine. Antibody responses to NANP, 35.1, 55.1 and 83.1-kDa peptide were found in 3%, 33%, 49% and 33% of these children. Overall, no significant correlation was found between the level of anti-SPf66 antibody at the beginning of the malaria transmission season following vaccination and the subsequent risk of malaria. However, further analysis showed that among the control children who had acquired antibodies to SPf66 as a result of natural exposure to malaria, those with high levels of anti-SPf66 were less at risk of malaria, perhaps reflecting their greater previous exposure and thus immunity. In contrast, among children who had received three doses of SPf66, those with high antibody levels were at greater risk of have malaria during the subsequent malaria transmission season.
