Serodiagnosis of Leishmania donovani infections: assessment of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays using recombinant L. donovani gene B protein (GBP) and a peptide sequence of L. donovani GBP. The repetitive sequence of Leishmania major gene B protein (GBP) has previously been shown to be a useful tool in the diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). Here, we have assessed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) using recombinant L. donovani GBP (rGBP) and a peptide sequence of L. donovani GBP (GBPP) in the diagnosis of L. donovani infections in Sudan. The sensitivity of the rGBP ELISA in diagnosing visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) was 92% and 93%, respectively. In contrast, the sensitivity of the GBPP ELISA was 55% for VL and 63% for PKDL. Plasma antibody reactivity of donors with VL and PKDL remained high for an extended period after the end of treatment. Antibody-reactivity to rGBP and GBPP was detected in 71% and 14% of plasma samples from CL patients, respectively. Plasma from healthy Sudanese donors living in an area endemic for malaria but free of leishmaniasis was negative in both assays.
