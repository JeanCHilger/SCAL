Laser light scattering immunoassay for malaria. Laser light scattering immunoassay (LIA) was proposed as a prospective diagnostic method for the detection of antibody (or antigen) by monitoring the agglutination of antigen (or antibody) coated carrier particles using dynamic light scattering (DLS) as probe. LIA is a very sensitive assay as it can detect microscopic immune complexes even when antibody (or antigen) level is low. A sizeable number of human sera collected from malaria endemic areas and hospitals have been analysed by ELISA using Pf parasite lysate or a RESA derived synthetic peptide as antigen parallel to LIA using Pf antigen coated polystyrene latex beads. Comparative analysis of data suggests LIA to be as good as ELISA and possibly better in terms of sensitivity and simplicity. LIA can be a simple and inexpensive immunoassay suitable for field use and mass application.
