Comparison of the OptiMAL test with PCR for diagnosis of malaria in immigrants. The OptiMAL test (Flow Inc., Portland, Oreg.), which detects a malaria parasite lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) antigen, has not been evaluated for its sensitivity in the diagnosis of malaria infection in various epidemiological settings. Using microscopy and a PCR as reference standards, we performed a comparison of these assays with the OptiMAL test for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax infection in 550 immigrants who had come from areas where malaria is endemic to reside in Kuwait, where malaria is not endemic. As determined by microscopy, 125 (23%) patients had malaria, and of these, 84 (67%) were infected with P. vivax and 36 were infected with P. falciparum in 5 cases the parasite species could not be determined due to a paucity of the parasites. The PCR detected malaria infection in 145 (26%) patients
