Self-use of rapid tests for malaria diagnosis by tourists. In a survey among febrile European tourists in Kenya, only 68% were able to carry out immunochromatographic dipstick tests for detection of Plasmodium falciparum antigen correctly, and ten of 11 with malaria failed to diagnose themselves correctly. Rapid tests for self-diagnosis by tourists cannot be recommended without appropriate training before departure.
