Control of epidemic malaria on the highlands of Madagascar. The Malagashy national malaria control programme ('Programme National de Lutte contre le Paludisme', PNLP) has been developing, since 1996, an epidemiological early warning system for malaria epidemics in the Central Highlands with the support of the Italian Development Cooperation. The system is based on the monitoring of malaria morbidity (clinical diagnosis) in 536 peripheral health centres (CSB) of the Highlands. The intervention area corresponds to 27 districts of the Antananarivo and Fianarantsoa provinces (4.7 million inhabitants) and spans around 100,000 square km. For each CSB a monthly warning threshold, defined as the 1993-1996 monthly mean number of malaria cases plus two standard deviations, was established. Three levels of epidemic alert have been defined according to the number of times the cases of presumptive malaria surpassed the threshold and according to the reported presence of severe malaria cases. The surveillance system relies also on the monitoring, in district hospitals of the Highlands, of the Plasmodium falciparum infection rate among clinically diagnosed malaria cases. A total of 185,589 presumptive malaria cases, corresponding to a 42/1000 malaria incidence, were recorded in 1997 by the surveillance system. During the same year 184 alerts of 2nd degree were reported. During 1998 173,632 presumptive malaria cases corresponding to a 38/1000 incidence were reported and 207 alerts of 2nd degree were detected 75 of these alerts were investigated with ad hoc surveys and 3 initial malaria epidemics identified and controlled. Out of 6884 presumptive malaria cases diagnosed in the district hospitals during 1997-1998, only 835 (12.1%) have been confirmed by microscopy (P. falciparum 81.7%, P. vivax 15.0%, P. malariae 2.5%, P. ovale 0.2%, mixed infections 0.6%)
