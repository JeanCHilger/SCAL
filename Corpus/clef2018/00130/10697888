Chemotherapeutic malaria control as a selective primary health care activity in the Solomon Islands. Malaria control by chemotherapy has been established in rural villages of Guadalcanal, the Solomon Islands, following field trials. As a selective primary health care activity, mobile unit teams visited villages once or twice a year to detect malaria positives and gave chloroquine and primaquine to treat the infection and interrupt the transmission. On site diagnosis was by the use of acridine orange fluorescent staining or the ICTPf commercial diagnostic kit. To avoid possible haemolytic crises, a new single step screening method of G6PD deficiency was introduced. This approach has been accepted well by villagers and proved to be an efficient and feasible control method even in remote rural villages with endemic malaria transmission. Epidemiological modelling of the situation predicts reduction of prevalence in five years.
