Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2-based immunocapture diagnostic assay for malaria: cross-reactivity with rheumatoid factors. Recently introduced rapid nonmicroscopic immunocapture assays for the diagnosis of malaria infection are being evaluated for their sensitivity and specificity in various epidemiological settings. A Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP-2)-based assay (ICT) and a Plasmodium-specific lactate dehydrogenase test (OptiMAL) were evaluated for their specificities in different groups of patients who tested negative for malaria infection by microscopy. The patients were selected from different disease groups: rheumatoid arthritis, hepatitis C, toxoplasmosis, schistosomiasis, and hydatid disease. One hundred thirty-three of the 225 patients were positive for rheumatoid factor. Thirty-five of the 133 (26%) rheumatoid factor-positive patients gave a false-positive reaction with the ICT assay, but only 4 of these gave false-positive reactions with the OptiMAL test. Thirty-three of the 35 false-positive specimens became negative when repeat tested with the ICT assay after absorbing out the rheumatoid factor activity. Our study shows that the PfHRP-2-based ICT assay gave a false-positive reaction in 26% of the patients who had rheumatoid factors, but were negative for malaria by microscopy.
