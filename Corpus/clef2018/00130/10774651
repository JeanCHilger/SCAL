Differences in Anopheles composition and malaria transmission in the village settlements and cultivated farming zone in Sarawak, Malaysia. Anopheles mosquitos were surveyed using three trapping technics in four longhouse settlements and their respectively farming zone in western Sarawak, Malaysia. The study area was mountainous with tropical rain forest. An. leucosphyrus and An. donaldi were predominant in the farm huts. An. tessellatus and An. subpictus were more abundant in the village settlements. In both ecotypes, human baited traps yielded a significantly greater proportion of Anopheles mosquito than CDC light traps and landing biting catches. Circumsporozoite antigen positively rate, mosquito survival rate and parasite rate showed that malaria transmission is more intense in farm huts than in longhouse settlements. The entomological inoculation rate of An. donaldi and An. leucosphyrus in farm huts was 0.035 and 0.023, respectively. No sporozoite infections were observed in the main settlements.
