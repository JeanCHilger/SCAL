Control malaria to help defeat poverty, says WHO. In a report by the WHO, interventions against malaria could help alleviate poverty in countries where the disease is rife, and aid in boosting economic growth.  The WHO calls on the international community, private foundations, and international agencies to commit funds for malaria interventions and research.  This call was made since malaria has long term effects on trade, tourism, foreign investment, and commerce.  Moreover, repeated bouts of malaria add to costs through malnutrition and death among children and time off work among adults.  In this light, WHO further suggests the setting up of a malaria vaccine and purchase fund to spur pharmaceutical and biotechnological companies into developing a vaccine.  Furthermore, new therapeutic, preventive and diagnostic tools need to be developed, particularly drugs, insecticides and dipstick tests.
