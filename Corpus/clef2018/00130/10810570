Blood meal identification by using Microdot ELISA in vector mosquitoes. The blood meals of five mosquito species which are vectors for malaria, J.E. and Filaria were determined by using Microdot ELISA technique, which is a rapid and sensitive method. A total of 4354 freshly fed mosquitoes comprising of Anopheles culicifacies, An stephensi, Culex quinquefasciatus, Cx. vishnui gp. and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus were tested. Results of the study reveal that highest proportion of An. culicifacies between 76-100% fed on bovine host followed by 0.3 to 24.2% on human. Cx. vishnui showed 1.9% feeding on human, 49-87.7% on bovine and 7.4-12.3% on the pigs. It has been observed that malaria vectors namely An. culicifacies and An. stephensi are still zoophilic in nature. Similarly, the vector of J.E. namely Culex vishnui gp. and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus also fed on cattle but some samples have indicated feeding of blood meal from pigs.
