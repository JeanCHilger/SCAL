Quantitative buffy coat: a special adjunct for diagnosis of malaria. Quantitative buffy coats (QBC) technique was compared with conventional blood film technique for the diagnosis of malaria in a tertiary care hospital. The QBC technique was found to be a rapid technique with a sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 94%. Malaria species identification was also possible. It was essentially very useful to detect parasites below < or = 100 parasites/ul of blood by QBC technique. However, quantification of parasitaemia could not be made using this technique. Many cases of carriers having very few gametocytes in their blood were also identified. It is therefore, concluded that the QBC technique, may be appropriate for screening populations for malaria and for detection of asymptomatic carriers to control further transmission of the disease in the community.
