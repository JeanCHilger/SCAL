Malaria in São Tomé and Príncipe: parasite prevalences and vector densities. A cross-sectional survey was carried out in 16 localities on the island of São Tomé and three on the island of Príncipe, at the end of the rainy season of 1997, to determine malaria prevalence and vector densities. Blood samples from 664 inhabitants of all ages were examined by optical microscopy (OM) and PCR. Mosquito collections were made by outdoor landing captures from 21:00-23:00 h. Great differences were found between OM and PCR readings. OM had a sensitivity of 66%, a specificity of 79% and failed to reveal any mixed-infections. Overall prevalence, determined by PCR, was higher in São Tomé (53%) than in Príncipe (35%). It was highest in children below 16 years-old. All four human Plasmodium species occurred in São Tomé but P. ovale was not detected in Príncipe. The human population was largely asymptomatic. Bednet users had lower prevalence than did non-users. The FOREST form of Anopheles gambiae s.s., identified by PCR and cytogenetics, was the only vector on the islands. The sporozoite rate in São Tomé, assessed by ELISA, was 0.5%. Parasite prevalence and vector densities were positively correlated in São Tomé, where malaria transmission must occur predominantly in the more populated coastal areas.
