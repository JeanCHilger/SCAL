Differential ability of specific regions of Plasmodium falciparum sexual-stage antigen, Pfs230, to induce malaria transmission-blocking immunity. Antibodies raised against an Escherichia coli-produced recombinant protein encoding a 76-kDa section (region C) of malaria transmission-blocking vaccine candidate, Pfs230, have previously been shown to significantly reduce the ability of Plasmodium falciparum parasites to infect mosquitoes (71.2-89.8%). To further define the region of the Pfs230 required for transmission-blocking activity, four recombinant proteins each encoding a section of region C (Pfs230 amino acids 443-1132) were produced using the same E. coli expression system and tested for immunogenicity in mice: (i) r230/MBP.C5' encodes the first half of region C (amino acids 443-791, six cysteines) (ii) r230/MBP.CM1 encodes only cysteine motif (CM) 1 (amino acids 583-913, eight cysteines)
