Synergism of multiple adhesion molecules in mediating cytoadherence of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes to microvascular endothelial cells under flow. Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes (IRBCs) have been shown to interact with a number of endothelial adhesion molecules expressed on transfectants, on cell lines, and as immobilized purified receptor proteins under flow conditions. However, the experiments were designed in such a way that maximal numbers of adhesion molecules were provided as substratum. Whether the interactive events actually occur on microvascular endothelium, where the distribution and expression of adhesion molecules may be less, remains undetermined. In this study, the cytoadherance of IRBCs on human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMECs) as a model of human microvasculature was examined. IRBCs were observed to tether, roll, and adhere on resting HDMECs, which constitutively expressed CD36 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) at an optimal shear stress of 1 dyne/cm(2). Stimulation of HDMECs with tumor necrosis factor-alpha for 5 and 24 hours, which resulted in up-regulation of ICAM-1 and induction of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression, significantly increased the percentage of rolling cells that adhered without affecting the rolling flux. In contrast, P-selectin expression on HDMECs induced by oncostatin M led to an increase in both rolling flux and adhesion. Inhibition studies with receptor-specific monoclonal antibodies revealed that adhesion of IRBCs on HDMECs was largely CD36 dependent, whereas rolling could be mediated by any of the adhesion molecules studied. Collectively, these findings indicate that IRBCs interact synergistically with multiple adhesion molecules on vascular endothelium. The rolling of IRBCs may be the rate-limiting step in cytoadherance, since it can be modulated by cytokines to enhance CD36-mediated IRBC adhesion.
