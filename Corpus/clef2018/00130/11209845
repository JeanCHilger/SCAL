Usefulness of genus-specific PCR and Southern blot species-specific hybridization for the detection of imported malaria cases in Italy. A PCR method involving a genus-specific oligonucleotides set and Southern blot hybridization with four species-specific probes to P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and P. ovale was evaluated for the detection of malaria parasites in blood samples from 101 patients with clinically suspect malaria infection imported to Italy. Plasmodium falciparum was the main species detected. As determined by microscopy, 53 (52.4%) patients had malaria and of these: 40 (75.5%) were infected with P. falciparum 7 (13.2%) with P. vivax
