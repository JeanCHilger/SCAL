Evaluation & usefulness of a immunochromatographic test for rapid detection of Plasmodium falciparum infection. Rapid test (Parachek Pf) based on detection of HRP-2 protein specific to Plasmodium falciparum by immunochromatographic technique was evaluated. Prevalence of infection was 8.5%. The test was 100% sensitive & 99.5% specific on comparison with light microscopy. The test is useful for making 'on the spot' diagnosis.
