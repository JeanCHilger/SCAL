Naturally occurring plasmodia-specific circulating immune complexes in individuals of malaria endemic areas in India. Blood samples collected from individuals belonging to malaria endemic areas were assayed for antigen-specific circulating immune complexes in polyethylene glycol precipitates of serum by enzyme immunoassay. Sera were tested from patients with acute P. vivax and P. falciparum infections, from clinically immune individuals and also from healthy normals. Circulating immune complexes (CICs) containing immunoglobulin G and M isotypes were found to be abundant in individuals with ongoing and past infections and also in clinically immune donors. In patients with acute infection but without any past history of malaria, CICs of IgM type were found to be significantly higher. Demonstration of antigen/antibody specific CICs could be a useful indicator of active, ongoing and recent/past infection, also of the status of immune responses of individuals belonging to various endemic areas.
