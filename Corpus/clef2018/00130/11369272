Antibodies specific for heat shock proteins in human and murine malaria. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are immunodominant antigens recognized by the host immune system in various infectious diseases. We analyzed HSP-specific antibodies, including immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM and IgA, in sera from malaria patients in Thailand by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. All of the antibodies to HSP90 were remarkably increased in the patients compared with those in controls, while only IgM to HSP70 or IgA to HSP65 was significantly elevated. Further experiments showed that anti-HSP IgG was significantly increased in C57BL/6 mice infected with a non-lethal strain of Plasmodium yoelii, with anti-HSP90 IgG being the most elevated. These results suggest that the antigenic potential of HSP90 is higher than those of HSP70 and HSP65 in malaria infection.
