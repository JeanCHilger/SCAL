Field studies on the sensitivity and specificity of an immunochromatographic test for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in tribal areas of Orissa. A rapid immunodiagnostic test developed by an Australian Biotechnology company for the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum in the peripheral blood has been evaluated in the field for its sensitivity, specificity and efficacy in comparison to microscopic examination. The results showed that the tests sensitivity, specificity and efficacy were 98.2, 96.9 and 97.5 per cent respectively. The positive and negative predictive values of the test were 96.4 and 98.4 per cent respectively. The test when compared to the conventional microscopy did not show any statistically significant difference suggesting that the two diagnostic methods are equally good. The test performed did not show cross-reactions with other parasite species. It is a simple and rapid field diagnostic method, which does not require any expensive laboratory equipment or skilled personnel.
