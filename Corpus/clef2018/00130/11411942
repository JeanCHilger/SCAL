Evaluation of rapid immunocapture assays for diagnosis of Plasmodium vivax in Korea. The rapid immunocapture assays, OptiMal and ICT, were evaluated from 87 individuals for the diagnosis of malaria infections directly from whole blood. A total of 87 individuals was examined for malaria parasites by microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained blood smears, and 65 cases were positive for Plasmodium vivax by microscopy. Correspondingly, the OptiMal test identified malaria infection in 45 cases (69.2%) of microscopy positive cases. Of these, two cases were misinterpreted as Plasmodium falciparum, whereas ICT detected P. vivax infection in 29 (44.6%) patients. We would like to propose that rapid immuno capture assays are an easy method that can serve as a useful tool in addition to microscopy for the diagnosis of malaria, but sensitivity is not yet satisfactory for diagnosis of P. vivax in Korea.
