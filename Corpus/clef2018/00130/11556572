Natural human IgG subclass antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum blood stage antigens and their relation to malaria resistance in an endemic area of Thailand. The immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclass antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum blood stage antigens in the sera of 181 individuals living in malaria endemic area in Kanchanaburi Province, western Thailand, were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In this study, IgG3 and IgG1 were shown to be the predominant subclasses. Generally, IgG2 were coexpressed with IgG1 and IgG3 while IgG4 was found to coexpress with other three IgG subclasses. The levels of specific IgG1, IgG2, and IgG3 increased significantly with age (r = 0.295, p = 0.000 r = 0.416, p = 0.000
