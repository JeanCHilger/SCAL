African Quin: results of a pragmatic study on the diagnosis of uncomplicated malaria attacks and treatment using quinine in French-speaking Africa. Management and treatment of disease do not always conform with official recommendations. African-quin is a pragmatic multicentric study carried out in 13 African countries to evaluate non-conformities in the management and treatment of uncomplicated malarial attacks using quinine. This study involved a total of 3,981 patients with documented uncomplicated malarial attacks diagnosed by 500 clinical physicians. Physicians were supplied with quinine tablets (125 mg et 500 mg Quinimax containing 125 mg and 500 mg of quinine base respectively) to allow treatment according to the dose recommendations of the WHO (24 mg/kg/day of quinine base). In 38% of the 3,981 patients, diagnosis was based on clinical findings without measurement of parasitemia. The median dose of Quinimax was 15.4 mg/kg/day in 3 intakes in 67% and 2 intakes in 33%. The dose was 23.2 mg/kg/day for patients under 12 years and 14.7 mg/kg/day for patients over 18 years (p < 0.001). Treatment lasted for at least 5 days in 62% of patients. Fever control was achieved within a mean delay of 3.9 +/- 1.5 days and was followed by a rapid decrease in clinical symptoms. Clinical control (normal temperature) was obtained in 96% of patients. The dose of Quinimax was the same regardless of whether treatment was a success or failure. The results of this study demonstrate the gap between official recommendations and everyday clinical practice and raise several important questions concerning the basis for decision-making, treatment goals, drug dosage, and treatment duration.
