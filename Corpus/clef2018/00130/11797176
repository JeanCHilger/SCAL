Prevention of malaria in children. Although malaria kills approximately 1 million children each year, preventive measures can be effective in limiting the mortality and morbidity associated with malaria. Mosquito bites can be avoided by use of appropriate environmental control and use of protective clothing, bed nets, repellents, and insecticide. Chemoprophylaxis is a mainstay of malaria prevention, and new, effective agents are increasingly available. Rapid, accurate diagnosis and effective medical treatment can help people who become ill with malaria despite their preventive efforts. With careful attention to preventive efforts, malaria should be extremely rare in travelers similarly, broader implementation of preventive measures could decrease the burden of malaria on residents in areas where it is endemic.
