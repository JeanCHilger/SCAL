Value of a dipstick based on recombinant RK39 antigen for differential diagnosis of American visceral leishmaniasis from other sympatric endemic diseases in Venezuela. A laboratory trial using recombinant rK39 dipsticks for differential diagnosis of American visceral leishmaniasis (AVL) from other sympatric endemic diseases which share similar clinic features (Chagas disease, malaria, schistosomiasis and toxoplasmosis) was conducted in Venezuela. The 100% specificity of the test previously obtained in other countries was confirmed. The use of this test at the primary health care level in Venezuela for a rapid diagnosis of active AVL cases, which may avoid deaths, is recommended.
