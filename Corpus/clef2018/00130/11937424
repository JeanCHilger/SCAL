Multiplexed immunoassays by flow cytometry for diagnosis and surveillance of infectious diseases in resource-poor settings. An accurate, rapid and cost-effective diagnosis is the cornerstone of efficient clinical and epidemiological management of infections. Here we discuss the relevance of an emerging technology, multiplexed immunoassays read by flow cytometry, for the diagnosis of infectious diseases. In these assays, multiple fluorescent microspheres, conjugated to different antigens or antibodies, constitute the solid phase for detecting antibodies or antigens in biological samples. These assays seem to be more sensitive than traditional immunoassays, have a high throughput capacity, and provide a wide analytical dynamic range. Additionally, they have multiplexing ability-ie, they are capable of measuring multiple antibodies or antigens simultaneously. We discuss four different areas where this technology could make an impact in resource-poor settings: (i) infections causing rash and fever in children (ii) sero-epidemiological studies on vaccine-preventable diseases
