Detection of malaria parasites by nested PCR in south-eastern, Iran: evidence of highly mixed infections in Chahbahar district. Rapid diagnosis and correct treatment of cases are the main objectives of control programs in malaria-endemic areas.To evaluate these criteria and in a comparative study, blood specimens were collected from 120 volunteers seeking care at the Malaria Health Center in Chahbahar district. One hundred and seven out of 120 Giemsa-stained slides were positive for malaria parasites by microscopy. Eighty-four (70%) and 20 (16.7%) were identified as having only Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infections, respectively, while only 3 (2.5%) were interpreted as having mixed P. vivax-P. falciparum infections. The target DNA sequence of the 18S small sub-unit ribosomal RNA (ssrRNA) gene was amplified by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and used for the diagnosis of malaria in south-eastern Iran. One hundred twenty blood samples were submitted and the results were compared to those of routine microscopy. The sensitivity of PCR for detection of P. vivax and P. falciparum malaria was higher than that of microscopy: nested PCR detected 31 more mixed infections than microscopy and parasite positive reactions in 9 out of the 13 microscopically negative samples. The results also confirmed the presence of P. vivax and P. falciparum.These results suggest that, in places where transmission of both P. vivax and P. falciparum occurs, nested PCR detection of malaria parasites can be a very useful complement to microscopical diagnosis.
