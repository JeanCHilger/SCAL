Diagnosis of Falciparum malaria by immunochromatographic test. To evaluate the applicability of rapid immunochromatographic test(ICT) for diagnosing falciparum malaria in outpatient clinics in endemic area.With thick blood smear method as control, ICT was used for the detection of P. falciparum.The sensitivity and specificity of ICT in detecting P. falciparum was 94.7% and 90.3%, respectively. No cross-reaction with P. vivax was found (P > 0.05).ICT is much more rapid and simple than thick blood smear method for the diagnosis of falciparum malaria, and can be applied in the outpatient clinics in endemic area.
