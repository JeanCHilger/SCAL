Efficiency and specificity of the KAT-test for rapid diagnosis of falciparum malaria. A new rapid KAT Quick Malaria test for the diagnosis of falciparum malaria, which is based on the detection of a monoclonal antibody-antigen complex of malaria parasites, has been worked out by the KAT Medical CC in South Africa. The efficiency and specificity of the KAT test were compared with those of the microscopic method and with the ICT test for rapid diagnosis of P. falciparum and P. vivax. The polymerase chain reaction was used as a control test. Testing for malaria was performed on 98 blood samples from feverish patients in Vietnam and Tadjikistan and among the persons who had returned to Moscow from endemic regions. The efficiency of the KAT test for falciparum-malaria was found to be 100% versus 90.5% with ICT. The absence of cross-reactions with P. vivax and the presence of pseudopositive results of the KAT test for fever cases of non-malaria origin indicate its high specificity. There was no correlation between the rate of test line colouring and the level of parasitemia. The KAT test yielded positive results only when gametocytes were found in blood specimens.
