Immunoglobulin G and subclass responses to Plasmodium falciparum antigens: a study in highly exposed Cameroonians. We conducted a cross-sectional study in Bolifamba village in the South West Province of Cameroon to determine antibody responses to crude Plasmodium falciparum antigens. A total of 347 subjects were examined. Parasite counts were obtained on thick blood films stained with Field's stain. Total immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgG subclass levels were determined in serum samples from four groups comprising children 1 to 5 years old and adults > or = 18 years with or without falciparum malaria parasites, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with crude blood-stage antigens of Plasmodium falciparum strain F32 as target. Depending on the age group, malaria prevalence varied between 10% and 65% with a mean of 30.8%. Prevalence rate and parasite density declined with increasing age. Total IgG and IgG1-3 levels were significantly higher in adults than in children (p < 0.05). Parasite-bearing individuals in both age groups had higher IgG titres than their non-infected counterparts, while subtype levels were not significantly different (p = 0.05). These findings indicate that Bolifamba village could be a convenient site to study further the protective immunity to malaria.
