Non-microscopic method for malaria diagnosis using OptiMAL IT, a second-generation dipstick for malaria pLDH antigen detection. Rapid diagnostic tests for malaria are now a commonly used procedure for malaria diagnosis. New or improved devices need to be evaluated against a recognised gold-standard procedure and subjected to conditions of temperature and humidity that may affect their performance. The OptiMAL 48 RDT has now been available commercially for several years and a second-generation OptiMAL IT test is now coming onto the market. In this study the problems associated with the routine use of OptiMAL 48 is investigated and its performance compared with a second-generation individual test, OptiMAL IT. Sensitivity and specificity for detection of all malaria species for both tests were comparable but loss of sensitivity of the test strips due to humidity or temperature found with the routine use of OptiMAL 48 was not seen with the individual OptiMAL IT. False-positive results for Plasmodium falciparum, seen in two negative blood samples, were attributed to the presence of high levels of heterophile antibodies.
