Plasma glucose and tumour necrosis factor-alpha in adult patients with severe falciparum malaria. Plasma glucose was assessed in 81 patients with severe falciparum malaria at the time of presentation along with tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). The lowest plasma glucose value was 3.38 mmol/l and none of the patients had hypoglycaemia at admission. Plasma glucose values were not significantly lower in those with multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) than in patients with single organ dysfunction (cerebral malaria only) and in those who died compared with patients who survived. Conversely, TNF-alpha showed a good correlation with depth of coma and was significantly higher in patients who had MOD and those who died. There was no correlation between plasma glucose and TNF-alpha values.
