Immunoglobulin E (IgE) containing complexes induce IL-4 production in human basophils: effect on Th1-Th2 balance in malaria. Human basophils are potent producers of IL-4 following cross-linking of the high affinity receptor for IgE (Fc epsilon R1). Elevated levels of both total- and malaria-specific IgE have been demonstrated in sera from people living in malaria-endemic regions. Whether or not these IgE antibodies are pathogenic is unclear. Serum containing high IgE levels obtained from malaria individuals was used to establish whether IgE-immune complexes could induce IL-4 production in human basophils. The basophils, obtained from healthy donors, were primed with 10 ng/ml of IL-3 before being transferred to wells containing goat anti-human IgE or human antimalarial IgE-immune complexes. IL-4 was induced upon stimulation of human basophils by plate bound IgE-containing immune complexes. Basophils treated similarly but with goat anti-IgG/human antimalarial- IgG-immune complexes did not secrete IL-4. Similarly mononuclear cells depleted of basophils in parallel culture did not secrete IL-4. Thus, human basophils may contribute to the polarization of T-helper type 2 in the (Th2) responses in malaria hosts via IgE-induced IL-4 production.
