Modulation of immune response in Plasmodium falciparum malaria: role of IL-12, IL-18 and TGF-beta. The interaction between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 12 (IL-12), interleukin 18 (IL-18) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) plays an important role in malaria pathogenesis and outcome, modulating the immunoresponse in Plasmodium falciparum malaria. In our previous studies, we analyzed the plasmatic levels of IL-12, IL-18 and TGF-beta in 105 African children with different degrees of malaria and we correlated the production of these cytokines with the severity of the disease. The aim of the present study was to analyze with a mathematical model, taking into account all the relationships between these cytokines and the parameter variations involved in malaria pathogenesis that influence the results of each type of treatment or therapeutic protocol on patients at different stages of the disease. A mathematical correlation was demonstrated between the levels of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and from this it was possible to build curves of reference in which each patient was positioned based on IL-12 level. Our data, obtained in patients with mild and severe diseases, demonstrate that the levels of IL-12 represent a reliable parameter to predict the progression of the disease, which may be complemented or modulated by administration of IL-18 and TGF-beta. Our findings provide future implications for an immune therapy against the P. falciparum malaria infection, especially in the early phase of the disease showing that a more aggressive outcome may be due to the lack of a balanced immune response.
