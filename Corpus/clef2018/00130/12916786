Performance of rapid malaria Pf antigen test for the diagnosis of malaria and false-reactivity with autoantibodies. Recently introduced rapid nonmicroscopic immunocapture assays for the diagnosis of malaria infection are being evaluated for their sensitivity and specificity in various epidemiological settings. A Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein-2 (PfHRP-2)-based assay (ICT malaria Pf assay) was evaluated for its performance and compared to that of Giemsa-stained thick blood film microscopy. Of the 515 patients tested, 163 were positive for malaria parasites on thick blood film microscopy: 87 were infected with P. vivax 63 with P. falciparum
