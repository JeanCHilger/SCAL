Cerebral malaria in children: serum and cerebrospinal fluid TNF-alpha and TGF-beta levels and their relationship to clinical outcome. This was a prospective study conducted at the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital, Eldoret, Kenya. Twenty-three children admitted to the hospital with cerebral (CM) and 10 children with non-cerebral malaria (NCM) were studied. The aim of the study was to establish and compare levels of tumour necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) and transforming growth factor (TGF-beta1) in these children. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytokine levels were assayed using ELISA kits. In serum, TGF-beta1 and TNF-alpha decreased over 5 days after admission to the hospital in both groups of patients with CM and NCM. In the CSF of cerebral cases the levels of TNF-alpha and TGF-beta1 were low and inversely related. Children in deeper coma had lower levels in serum of TGF-beta and higher levels of TNF-alpha than those in lighter levels of coma. The serum TNF-alpha levels in CM children were the same irrespective of the duration of illness before admission, but children with NCM who had been sick for a shorter duration before admission tended to have higher serum levels of TNF-alpha and higher levels of TGF-beta than those with a longer duration of illness before admission. In conclusion, this study shows that TNF-alpha and TGF-beta1 may not be useful in predicting the outcome for CM. They may, however, be useful in detecting children at risk of developing deep coma. TNF-alpha and TGF-beta levels were inversely related both in serum and CSF.
