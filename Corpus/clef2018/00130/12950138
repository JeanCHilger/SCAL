Development and evaluation of an immunochromatographic kit for the detection of antibody to Plasmodium vivax infection in South Korea. Malaria is a major parasitic disease in tropical areas. Three to five hundred million people suffer from the disease and it kill a million people per year. Blood smear observation was developed for the diagnosis of malaria, but the examination needs skilled experts and exact diagnosis is time consuming. A kit based on immunochromatography can be a reliable and rapid method for clinical diagnosis, even in the hands of inexperienced personnel. However, all such currently developed kits can only diagnose P. falciparum malaria. In our previous report, the C-terminal region of P. vivax merozoite surface protein 1 (PvcMSP) was cloned and expressed in E. coli. In the present study, we developed an immunochromatographic kit using this PvcMSP for the diagnosis of specific antibody to P. vivax malaria in serum samples. The kit was used to examine sera from vivax malaria patients and non-malaria- infected person and the test showed 100% sensitivity (78/78) and 98.3% specificity (58/59). This result demonstrated that the immunochromatographic kit for P. vivax antibody detection is applicable for the rapid and precise diagnosis of P. vivax malaria.
