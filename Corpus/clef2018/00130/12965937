Differential recognition of Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein 2 variants by antibodies from malaria patients in Brazil. Four variants of merozoite surface protein 2 (MSP-2) of Plasmodium falciparum were used in serology to examine whether changes in repeat units affect its recognition by antibodies during infection with parasites of known MSP-2 types. The results indicate that variation in MSP-2 repeats may represent a mechanism for parasite immune evasion.
