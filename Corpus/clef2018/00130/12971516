Efficacy of permethrin-impregnated bed nets on malaria control in a hyperendemic area in Irian Jaya, Indonesia III. Antibodies to circumsporozoite protein and ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen. A two years intervention study was carried out using permethrin impregnated bed nets in a hyperendemic area, in Irian Jaya, Indonesia. To assess the influence of this intervention on natural immunity, concurrent immunological studies to determine levels of antibodies to the circumsporozoite (CS) and ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen (RESA) proteins were conducted. Prevalence and titers of immunoglobulins (Ig)G and IgG subclasses were periodically measured in 138 individuals (30 children under the age of ten and 108 villagers ten years old and older). In the younger group, seropositivity of total IgG against CS fluctuated according to the parasite infection rates however, IgG seropositive reaction against RESA gradually increased. In the older age group, seropositivity of both kinds of antibodies was stable during the whole study period. Nevertheless, the geometric mean titers of total IgG against CS and RESA were significantly reduced in this latter group in individuals who contained these antibodies before and after intervention. The geometric mean titer of IgG3 subclass against RESA was decreased at a highly significant level (p = 0.0005), and that of IgG4 against the same antigen was also decreased although to a lesser extent (p = 0.02).
