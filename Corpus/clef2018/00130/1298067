Immunological studies on some bacterial and parasitic diseases in Thailand. Over the past two decades a wide range of immunological studies have been carried out on organisms responsible for causing serious bacterial and parasitic diseases in Thailand. Particular emphasis has been placed on cholera, where investigations have been directed towards vaccine development and rapid diagnosis and on diagnosis of typhoid and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli. In the area of parasitic diseases emphasis has been directed especially to immunodiagnosis of helminthic diseases, including gnathostomiasis, paragonimiasis, opisthorchiasis, strongyloidiasis and trichinellosis. These studies are reviewed in this report.
