Detection of circulating plasmodial antigens in human sera by sandwich ELISA with monoclonal antibodies. Two monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), one produced against Plasmodium falciparum (PF-IG8) and the other against P. cynomolgi (PC-IE12) schizont antigens were used in a sandwich ELISA for the detection of circulating plasmodial antigens in sera of patients infected with either P. falciparum, P. vivax or P. malariae. The mean +/- SD optical density (OD) values for the normal control group using PF-108 and PC-1E12 were 0.351 +/- 0.036 and 0.205 +/- 0.044, respectively. Mean OD values for the three infected groups were found to be significantly higher than those of the normal control group for both MAbs. However, ELISA values for individual serum specimens did not correlate with the level of parasitemia in the infected blood. Using a cut-off point of mean OD +/- 3 SD of the normal control group as indicating a positive reading, the specificity of this assay with both MAbs was 100%. The sensitivity of the assay using PF-1G8 was 95% while that obtained with PC-1E12 was 98%.
