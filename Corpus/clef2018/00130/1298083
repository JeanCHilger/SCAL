Two-site pan-species monoclonal antibody ELISA for detection of blood stage malaria antigen. A two-site pan-species monoclonal antibody sandwich ELISA (MAb-MAb ELISA) was developed to detect both Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum antigens in whole blood impregnated on filter paper. In this assay, the plates were coated with pan-species MAb 3F9 and another pan-species MAb M26-32 conjugated with alkaline phosphatase was used for detection of bound antigen. The sensitivity of this assay was 5, 10 and 10 parasites per 10(6) erythrocytes for cultured P. falciparum, patient-derived P. vivax and P. falciparum, respectively. The coincidence rates for this assay were 93% (92/99) with healthy individuals and 93% (42/45) with microscopically confirmed vivax malaria cases. After two weeks treatment, 77.7% (14/18) of vivax malaria were still positive by this assay but with diminished level of reactivities [corrected].
