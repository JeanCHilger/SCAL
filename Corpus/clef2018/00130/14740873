Evaluation of the Binax NOW ICT test versus polymerase chain reaction and microscopy for the detection of malaria in returned travelers. Microscopic detection of Plasmodium species has been the reference standard for the diagnosis of malaria for more than a century. However, maintaining a sufficient level of expertise in microscopic diagnosis can be challenging, particularly in non-endemic countries. The objective of this study was to compare a new rapid malaria diagnostic device (NOW ICT Malaria Test Binax, Inc., Portland, ME) to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and expert microscopy for the diagnosis of malaria in 256 febrile returned travelers. Compared with PCR, the NOW ICT test showed a sensitivity of 94% for the detection of P. falciparum malaria (96% for pure P. falciparum infection) and 84% for non-P. falciparum infections (87% for pure P. vivax infections and 62% for pure P. ovale and P. malariae infections), with an overall specificity of 99%. The Binax NOW ICT may represent a useful adjunct for the diagnosis of P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria in febrile returned travelers.
