The use of impregnated curtains does not affect antibody responses against Plasmodium falciparum and complexity of infecting parasite populations in children from Burkina Faso. In Burkina Faso, where malaria is hyper-endemic and transmission intensity is very high, the majority of malaria-related morbidity and mortality occurs in children less than 5 years of age. A control measure such as the use of insecticide-treated curtains (ITC) significantly reduces transmission of malaria infection. Concerns remain whether reduced transmission intensity may lead to a delay in the development of immunity in younger children and even to a partial loss of already acquired immunity. In this study, the levels of P. falciparum-specific IgG subclasses, the number of infecting parasite clones determined by PCR-based genotyping of the msp2 gene and the parasite density were analysed in 154 asymptomatic children (3-6 years) living in 16 villages (8 with and 8 without ITC) in the vicinity of Ouagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso. In addition, the parasite inhibitory effects of Ig fractions, prepared from selected children, in co-operation with normal human monocytes were studied. Blood samples from asymptomatic ITC-users showed a significant decrease in P. falciparum prevalence as well as in parasite density. However, no significant difference was observed in P. falciparum-specific antibodies or in parasite multiplicity of infection between the two groups. Furthermore, Ig fractions from children of both groups showed similar levels of inhibitory activity against autologous parasite growth both on their own and in co-operation with monocytes.
