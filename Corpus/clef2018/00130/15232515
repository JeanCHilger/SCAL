Systematic review of the accuracy of the ParaSight-F test in the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. The Parasight-F test is a device for the rapid diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. In a number of field studies rather wide disparities in the performance of the test have been reported. To provide an evaluation of the quality of available reports and an overall summary of diagnostic accuracy of the Parasight-F test, we have performed a systematic review.Systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of Parasight-F test in comparison with light microscopy.15,359 subjects (4,119 with falciparum malaria) studied with the Parasight-F test as reported in 32 studies from 29 publications.Summary receiving operator characteristic (SROC) curve as well as odds ratio calculated by the fixed effect model and the random effect model. Based on pooled data, the predictive values were calculated for a range of P. falciparum prevalence through a Bayesian approach.Overall, the Parasight-F test demonstrated 0.90 (95%, confidence intervals 0.88-0.93) sensitivity and 0.94 (0.92-0.96) specificity. Both sensitivity and specificity were significantly higher in the non-resident than in the resident population. The post-test probability indicates that in settings of low malaria prevalence, a negative test almost absolutely excludes infection, while in settings of high prevalence, the same result still gives a substantial chance of infection being present.The Parasight-F test is a simple and accurate test for the diagnosis of P. falciparum infection. The test could be of particular value in the diagnosis of malaria in travelers returning from endemic areas.
