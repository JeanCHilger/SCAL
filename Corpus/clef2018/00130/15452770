Comparative diagnostic performance of two commercial rapid tests for malaria in a non-endemic area. In the study reported here, the diagnostic performance of two new rapid tests for the diagnosis of malaria was evaluated in symptomatic patients in a non-endemic area. Of 557 consecutive patients, 109 (19.6%) had documented malaria. For the NOW ICT MALARIA P.f./P.v. (Binax, Portland, ME, USA) and OptiMAL IT (Diamed, Cressier, Switzerland) tests, respectively, sensitivity values were 96.3% and 79.8% (P-value, 0.0001), and specificity values were 98.8% and 98.4%. The NOW ICT test did not detect two of 80 Plasmodium falciparum infections, and it generated false-positive results for five patients. The OptiMAL IT test failed to detect ten of the P. falciparum infections, and it generated seven false-positive results. The results suggest that these rapid diagnostic tests for malaria may be useful, but they cannot replace microscopic examination of blood films.
