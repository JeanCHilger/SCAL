A protective merozoite protein of Plasmodium falciparum shares an epitope with surface antigens of Paramecium. A Plasmodium falciparum cDNA expression clone, lambdaPf9, had been identified earlier as a protective epitope, using anti-lambdaPf9 antibodies and combinatorial phagotopes. A segment of the Pf9 gene showed homology with Paramecium immobilization surface antigens such as 51B, 51A and 156G. A synthetic Pf9-peptide was designed from this region, and specific antibodies were raised. Each of these anti-Pf9 antibodies and combinatorial reagents, as well as anti-Paramecium 51B antibodies, recognized the Pf9-peptide on ELISA, and the same protein band in parasite immunoblots. The P. falciparum protein was released from the merozoite membrane fraction on treatment with PI-PLC, indicating the presence of a GPI anchor. Anti-Pf9-peptide antibodies specifically inhibited the growth of P. falciparum in culture. Immunofluorescence assays showed the reactivity of anti-Pf9-peptide sera with P. falciparum merozoites and gametocytes, as well as on the surface of Paramecium tetraurelia. The Pf9-peptide was able to induce proliferation of splenic lymphocytes obtained from mice infected with the rodent malarial parasites Plasmodium berghei and Plasmodium yoelii. These results point towards Plasmodium Pf9 as a conserved novel protective protein, sharing an epitope with Paramecium surface antigens.
