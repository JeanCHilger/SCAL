Natural antibody response to Plasmodium falciparum Exp-1, MSP-3 and GLURP long synthetic peptides and association with protection. A longitudinal study was undertaken in Burkina Faso among 293 children aged 6 months to 9 years in order to determine the correlation between an antibody response to several individual malarial antigens and malarial infection. It was found that the presence of a positive antibody response at the beginning of the rainy season to three long synthetic peptides corresponding to Plasmodium falciparum Exp-1 101-162, MSP-3 154-249 and GLURP 801-920 but not to CSP 274-375 correlated with a statistically significant decrease in malarial infection during the ongoing transmission season. The simultaneous presence of an antibody response to more than one antigen is indicative of a lower frequency of malarial infection. This gives scientific credibility to the notion that a successful malaria vaccine should contain multiple antigens.
