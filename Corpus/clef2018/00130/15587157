Evaluation of the enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay in detecting circumsporozoite protein of anopheline vectors in Yunnan. To detect circumsporozoite protein (CSP) in anopheline vectors from south Yunnan and to evaluate ELISA in the detection.Salivary glands of the anopheline mosquitoes were taken for finding sporozoites by microscopy and part of the glands was used for detecting CSP by ELISA. An. minimus was experimentally infected by blood from vivax malaria patient (with Plasmodium vivax) and examined for sporozoites and CSP. Eight species of anopheline mosquitoes were caught in the field and examined. Monoclonal antibodies to P. falciparum (Pf2A10) and P. vivax (Pv210, Pv247) were used in ELISA for detecting CSP.Sporozoites were found in the salivary glands of 27 out of 36 An. minimus experimentally infected (75.0%), 29 were ELISA CSP positives (80.6%), and 26 of the 27 mosquitoes showed Pv210 CSP positive. Among 1010 parous anopheline mosquitoes from the field, 7 were found sporozoite positive (0.69%), 8 were ELISA CSP positive (0.79%), and 6 of the 7 mosquitoes showed CSP positive. Of 4675 wild mosquitoes in 8 anopheline species with different ages, 11 were found CSP positive (0.24%) including An. minimus, An. sinensis and An. maculatus with a positive rate of 0.20%, 0.24% and 0.39% respectively. Among the 11 mosquitoes, 9 were Pv210 positive and 2 were Pf2A10 positive.CSP detection by ELISA is a useful method to monitor the malaria transmission capacity of anopheline vectors.
