Significance of the automated blood count. Modern hematology depends on rapid and accurate determination of quantitative and qualitative blood counts. Fully automated analyzers based on the principles of flow cytometry have replaced the traditional blood smear in the routine laboratory. They count the number of red cells, platelets and leukocytes with high precision. In addition, they divide the cells into different populations according to their physical or chemical properties. This population distribution pattern mimics a "differential" blood smear. Normality can be assessed with a high degree of accuracy, rapidly and reproducibly. The qualitative changes frequently provide pointers to the final diagnosis. In case of abnormalities the reports are flagged. A microscopic analysis should be added according to internal laboratory guidelines. It clarifies pathological findings and is essential in the search for specific abnormalities such as malaria. This underlines the need for exchange of information between physician and laboratory.
