Estimation of malaria transmission in high-risk provinces of Morocco. The malaria transmission level of Plasmodium vivax was monitored in four high-risk provinces in Morocco. Intensive mosquito collection by light traps and manual catches resulted in the capture of four species: Anopheles labranchiae, An. sergenti, An. cinereus, and An. claviger. All An. sergenti and An. labranchiae females collected were tested for the presence of two phenotypes of P. vivax (PVK210 and PVK247) antigen by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). No P. vivax antigen was detected in 1347 mosquitoes analysed. A parallel parasitological investigation was conducted. Of 2665 slides examined from a population of 4343 people for detection of P. vivax, no slide was positive. The results confirm the break in malaria transmission in residual foci. The use of ELISA is recommended in future epidemiological studies of human malaria.
