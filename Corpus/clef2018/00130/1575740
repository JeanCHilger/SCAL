Molecular cloning and serological characterization of a new Plasmodium vivax recombinant antigen which contains apolipoprotein B-100 like sequences. We have isolated a new recombinant antigen 'PV12' of Plasmodium vivax by immunological screening of the genomic library. The antigen shows a sequence homology with human apolipoprotein B-100. A large number of P. vivax infected individuals (79%) were seropositive against this antigen. The probable function of this antigen could be to evade the host defence system (i) by inactivating the perforin of natural killer cells and (ii) by engaging the host immune system to produce antibodies against this decoy antigen.
