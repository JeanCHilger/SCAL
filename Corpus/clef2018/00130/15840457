Studies on Plasmodium falciparum isotypic antibodies and numbers of IL-4 and IFN-gamma secreting cells in paired maternal cord blood from South West Cameroon. In this study, the effect of maternal peripheral and placental Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia on the level of antibody and cytokine immune responses in the neonate was investigated.Malaria parasites were detected by light microscopy. Levels of malaria-specific isotypic antibodies were measured in maternal and cord blood by indirect ELISA. The numbers of IFN-gamma and IL-4 cells produced by maternal/cord blood after in vitro stimulation were enumerated using the ELISPOT assay.Malaria parasite rate of maternal, placental biopsy and cord blood was 32.8%, 33.7% and 7.8% respectively. Overall, ELISA seropositivity rates for P. falciparum-specific IgG, IgM, IgE and IgA in the maternal plasma samples were 71%, 85%, 29.3%, and 0% respectively, while those for the cord samples were 69%, 6.0%, 4.4% and 0% respectively. Mean IgM ELISA OD(405) values of neonates born from positive placentas, or whose mothers had peripheral malaria parasitaemia were higher than those who were parasite negative. The mean number of maternal cells producing IFN-gamma was higher (P=0.0001) than that of the paired cord samples. The mean number of IL-4 producing cells of neonates born of mothers who were positive (P<0.05) or from malaria-positive placentas (P<0.025) was higher than from those who were malaria negative. Neonates born of malaria-positive mothers or from parasitized placentas mounted predominantly Th2 type immune responses.It appears from this study that neonates born from malaria-infected mothers or placentas may relatively be more susceptible to malaria attack during the first years of life.
