Seroprevalence of hepatitis B and malaria infection in LÃ¡brea, Brazilian western Amazon: estimates of coinfection rates. The Amazon region is known for the high occurrence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, and accounts for more than 98% of malaria cases in Brazil. Despite the controversy, it has been proposed that when associated they may lead to important effects in the natural history of both infections. This study estimates the prevalence of coinfection within general population of an endemic region of HBV and malaria in the Brazilian Amazon. The prevalence of HBsAg was 3.3% (95% CI 2.1%-5.1%,) and total anti-HBc 49.9% (95% CI 45.9%-53.8%). The prevalence of antibodies against Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum antigens was 51.4% (311/605) (95% CI 47.3%-55.4%). Related to the simultaneous presence of malaria antibodies and HBV serological markers, in 1.8% (11/605), (95% CI 1.0%-3.3%), the presence of HBsAg was also demonstrated, mean age 26 years (p <0.001). This study points to similarities in the distribution of these diseases, such as the occurrence mainly among young adults. The events may occur in different times. Also shown differences such as the low risk of malaria in the group up to fifteen years, where HBV circulates with moderate intensity. The prevalence of HBV and malaria coinfection is in fact less than the rates of HBsAg carriage, showing a heterogeneous pattern related to the clinical spectrum of HBV infection.
