Malaria prevalence and associated risk factors in Eritrea. A parasitological cross-sectional survey was undertaken from September 2000 through February 2001 to estimate the prevalence of malaria parasitemia in Eritrea. A total of 12,937 individuals from 176 villages were screened for both Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax parasite species using the OptiMal Rapid Diagnostic Test. Malaria prevalence was generally low but highly focal and variable with the proportion of parasitemia at 2.2% (range: 0.4% to 6.5%). Despite no significant differences in age or sex-specific prevalence rates, 7% of households accounted for the positive cases and 90% of these were P. falciparum. Multivariate regression analyses revealed that mud walls were positively associated with malaria infection (OR [odds ratio] = 1.6 [95% CI: 1.2, 2.2], P < 0.008). For countries with low and seasonal malaria transmission, such information can help programs design improved strategic interventions.
