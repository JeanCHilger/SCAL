Epidemiology and surveillance: changing the global picture of malaria--myth or reality? The burden of malaria remains unacceptably high, and the greatest burden is borne by the African continent. There is now wide agreement on the control strategies and tools, and a considerable increase in global resources invested in malaria control efforts. However, challenges remain, especially with achieving the necessary population coverage with these interventions in order to change the epidemiology of the disease. Existing tools may not be optimal, and are liable to fail with time, just as previous ones did. Current global antimalarial efforts need to be underpinned by a strong research and development agenda. If all these factors are taken into consideration, reducing the burden of malaria would seem more like a reality than a myth in the foreseeable future.
