A new and simple solid-phase extraction method for LC determination of pyronaridine in human plasma. A new approach using a simple solid-phase extraction technique has been developed for the determination of pyronaridine (PND), an antimalarial drug, in human plasma. After extraction with C18 solid-phase sorbent, PND was analyzed using a reverse phase chromatographic method with fluorescence detection (at lambda(ex)=267 nm and lambda(em)=443 nm). The mean extraction recovery for PND was 95.2%. The coefficient of variation for intra-assay precision, inter-assay precision and accuracy was less than 10%. The quantification limit with fluorescence detection was 0.010 microg/mL plasma. The method described herein has several advantages over other published methods since it is easy to perform and rapid. It also permits reducing both, solvent use and sample preparation time. The method has been used successfully to assay plasma samples from clinical pharmacokinetic studies.
