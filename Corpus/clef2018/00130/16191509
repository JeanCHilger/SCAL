Plasmodium DNA fluoresces with berberine: a novel approach for diagnosis of malarial parasites. The key to reducing mortality and morbidity associated with malaria is rapid diagnosis and early, effective therapy. Berberine, a plant alkaloid, has been used for fluorescent staining of the Y chromosome. We evaluated whether berberine can be used for staining of malarial parasites in 40 selected peripheral blood smears from patients with clinical symptoms of malaria smears were evaluated with OptiMal (DiaMed, Miami, FL) and Giemsa stain. Twenty were positive with both OptiMal and Giemsa (Plasmodium vivax, 14
