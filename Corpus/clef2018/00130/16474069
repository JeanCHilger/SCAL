High titers of IgG antibodies against Plasmodium falciparum serine repeat antigen 5 (SERA5) are associated with protection against severe malaria in Ugandan children. Plasmodium falciparum serine repeat antigen (SERA5) is a promising asexual blood stage malaria candidate vaccine. However, there is a paucity of information about natural immune responses to SERA5 in children from malaria-endemic regions. We undertook a hospital-based case-control study of severe malaria in Apac District, Northern Uganda, in children 6-59 months of age. The commonest symptoms observed in children with severe malaria (SM) were respiratory distress (53.4%) and prostration (40.4%) followed by circulatory collapse (7.4%), severe anemia (Hb < 5 g/dL, 7.0%), and seizures (2.6%). None of the SM children had impaired consciousness, coma, or cerebral malaria. We measured serum IgG antibodies using a recombinant construct of SERA5 (SE36) in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. High titers of IgG anti-SE36 were associated with protection against severe malaria in children under 5 years old.
