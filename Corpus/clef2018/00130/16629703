Transmission-reducing immunity is inversely related to age in Plasmodium falciparum gametocyte carriers. Immunity to the sexual stages of Plasmodium falciparum is induced during natural infections and can significantly reduce the transmission of parasites to mosquitoes (transmission reducing activity TRA) but little is known about how these responses develop with increasing age/exposure to malaria. Routinely TRA is measured in the standard membrane feeding assay (SMFA). Sera were collected from a total of 199 gametocyte carriers (median age 4 years, quartiles 2 and 9 years) near Ifakara, Tanzania
