Malaria rapid diagnostic tests in tropical climates: the need for a cool chain. Malaria control programs in endemic countries increasingly rely on early case detection and treatment at village level. The rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and accompanying drugs on which the success of these programs depends deteriorate to varying degrees at high temperatures. To assess the ability of health systems to maintain RDTs within manufacturers' specifications, we monitored temperatures in the delivery chain from manufacturer through to the village health worker in Cambodia and the Philippines. In both countries, storage temperatures regularly exceeded those recommended for most RDTs intended for field use, whereas temperatures during transport greatly exceeded the lower and upper limits. These results emphasize the need for good logistical planning during the introduction of point-of-care tests in tropical countries and the importance of considering the stability of diagnostic tests during procurement.
