Randomized trial of 2-dose versus monthly sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine intermittent preventive treatment for malaria in HIV-positive and HIV-negative pregnant women in Malawi. Intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy (IPTp) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) decreases placental malaria parasitemia and associated maternal anemia, premature delivery, and low birth weight. However, the optimal regimen in the setting of a high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection remains unclear.In Malawi, where the efficacy of SP for the treatment of malaria in children is decreasing, we conducted a randomized, nonblinded study to compare the efficacy of monthly SP IPTp with a 2-dose regimen for the prevention of placental parasitemia in HIV-positive and -negative primigravid and secundigravid women.Of HIV-positive women, 7.8% who received monthly SP had placental malaria, compared with 21.5% of those who received 2-dose SP (relative risk [RR], 0.36 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.17-0.79]). Of HIV-negative women, 2.3% who received monthly SP and 6.3% who received 2-dose SP had placental malaria (RR, 0.37 [95% CI, 0.11-1.19]). Less than 1% of women reported adverse drug reactions, with no increase in HIV-positive women or those who received monthly SP.In HIV-positive pregnant women, monthly SP IPTp is more efficacious than a 2-dose regimen in preventing placental malaria. The study also demonstrates the continued efficacy of SP for the prevention of placental malaria, even in the face of its decreasing efficacy for the treatment of malaria in children. In areas with intense transmission of falciparum malaria and a high prevalence of HIV infection, monthly SP IPTp should be adopted.
