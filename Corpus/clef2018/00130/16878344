Rapid gas chromatography/mass spectrometry quinine determination in plasma after automated solid-phase extraction. The combined use of an automatic solid-phase extraction (SPE) apparatus with Oasis MCX cartridges and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to rapidly quantify quinine in biological samples with cyproheptadine as the internal standard is described. The selected ion monitoring mode, with the quantification ions m/z 136 and 287 (qualifier ions: m/z 261, 381 and 215, 96), allows the estimation of quinine levels, respectively. Separation was completed within 12.7 min. Excellent linearity was found up to 10 000 microg/L of plasma. The limit of detection (LOD) was 12.2 microg/L and the limit of quantification (LOQ) was 40.6 microg/L. High reproducibility (intra-assay CV range 1.9-4.3%, inter-assay CV range 2.2-11.3%) and accuracy values (intra-assay range 83.2-103.7%, inter-assay range 86.8-103.7%) were obtained. Recoveries were concentration-independent (97.2% and 89.8% for 4000 and 10 000 microg/L, respectively). This sensitive, simple assay for quinine in various matrices meets the current requirements for bioanalytical assays and may be used to monitor quinine levels in patients developing severe malaria with acute renal failure during hemofiltration. The optimal quinine dose in this situation is not really established and to improve clinical care, quinine concentrations might be explored to improve efficacy and minimise potential toxicity.
