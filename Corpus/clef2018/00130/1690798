Rapid diagnosis of Brugia malayi and Wuchereria bancrofti filariasis by an acridine orange/microhematocrit tube technique. A microhematocrit tube technique for diagnosis of human filariasis has been previously described. A system incorporating heparin, EDTA, and acridine orange into a microhematocrit tube (Quantitative Blood Count, QBC) has been commercially developed for the quantitation of blood counts and has been used for the diagnosis of malaria. We evaluated this test for its usefulness in the diagnosis of filariasis. Upon centrifugation, the parasites were concentrated in the area of the buffy coat and could be observed through the wall of the tube. The parasites were concentrated further by a plastic float that expands the buffy coat and confines the parasites to the periphery of the tube. Acridine orange stains the DNA of the parasite, and morphologic characteristics can be examined by fluorescence microscopy. The terminal and subterminal nuclei and long cephalic space of Brugia malayi, as well as the short cephalic space and caudal nuclei of Wuchereria bancrofti, were easily recognized and differentiated from each other. Microfilariae were detected in samples diluted to a level of approximately 50/ml.
