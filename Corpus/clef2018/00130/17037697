Evaluation of rK39 strip test for the diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis in infants. This study estimated the sensitivity and specificity of the rK39 strip test compared with the immunofluorescent antibody test and microscopy of bone marrow aspirate smears (the gold standard) in 47 children with suspected visceral leishmaniasis. A control group of children with other diagnoses (tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, malaria or cutaneous leishmaniasis) were also tested to check false positive results. The sensitivity and specificity of the strip test were 82.4% and 100% and that of immunofluorescent antibody were 100% and 92.7%. The rK39 strip test is reliable where there is no access to laboratory facilities.
