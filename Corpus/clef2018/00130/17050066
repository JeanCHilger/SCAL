Development of an automated malaria discriminant factor using VCS technology. Malaria diagnosis presents a challenge to all laboratories. There is a need for rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective screening on all samples, particularly in areas where malaria is endemic. Response to malaria infection involves an increased monocyte count and production of large activated monocytes. These changes can be detected by volume, conductivity, and scatter (VCS) technology on certain automated blood cell counters (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL). The SD of the volume of lymphocytes and monocytes demonstrates a significant difference from normal when malaria is present. By using a calculation derived from the SD volume of the lymphocytes and monocytes, herein termed the malaria factor, sensitivity of 98% and specificity 94% were demonstrated for the detection of malaria. Based on this derived discriminant, VCS technology should become a useful tool in the detection of malaria. A flag to indicate the potential presence of malaria could then be generated by the instrument if the user or manufacturer chose to do so.
