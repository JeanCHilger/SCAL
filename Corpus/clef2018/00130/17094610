CTL response to pre-erythrocytic stage vaccine candidate of plasmodium falciparum in HLA-A*0201 transgenic mice detected by ELISPOT assay. The importance of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) against malaria parasite in pre-erythrocytic stage has been presented in relevant researches. In order to investigate whether one CTL epitope (YLNKIQNSL) involved in a chimeric pre-erythrocytic stage vaccine candidate of Plasmodium falciparum which was expressed and purified in the laboratory can stimulate in vivo CTL response, HLA-A*0201 transgenic mice were immunized with this vaccine candidate. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assay was performed on the splenocytes from the immunized transgenic mice. Positive result indicated that this CTL epitope can be in vivo processed and correctly presented.
