Antibody responses to Plasmodium falciparum vaccine candidate antigens in three areas distinct with respect to altitude. Antibody levels against malaria antigens were measured among patients presenting with uncomplicated malaria at health centers from three locations in Zimbabwe (Bindura, Chiredzi and Kariba) that are distinct with regard to altitude and climatic conditions. Antibody levels were determined by ELISA using the antigens, apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA-1), erythrocyte binding antigen 175 (EBA-175), circumsporozoite surface protein (CSP), merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1) and Pfg27. For all the antigens tested, IgG and IgM levels were higher for Bindura (altitude 1100 m) compared to Kariba (<600 m, altitude) and Chiredzi (approximately 600 m, altitude) with the exception of IgG and IgM to AMA-1 and EBA-175 which were similar between Chiredzi and Bindura. Plasma samples were further analyzed for their functional activity by testing their ability to inhibit the growth of Plasmodium falciparum in culture. Our results, determined by microscopy and verified by the LDH assay revealed that plasma from the three locations had similar inhibitory activity against the growth of P. falciparum in vitro. Our data revealed that highest growth inhibition correlated with the highest levels of MSP-1 antibody values.
