Characterization of Plasmodium vivax heat shock protein 70 and evaluation of its value for serodiagnosis of tertian malaria. We have characterized Plasmodium vivax heat shock protein 70 (PvHSP70) and evaluated serodiagnostic applicability of recombinant PvHSP70 (rPvHSP70). In enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and immunoblot analyses, rPvHSP70 showed high sensitivity (88.8% 203/228 cases). P. falciparum-infected sera revealed positive reactions (78.8%). The predominant immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclasses were segregated with IgG1 and IgG3.
