Detection of different developmental stages of malaria parasites by non-radioactive DNA in situ hybridization. A highly sensitive non-radioactive DNA in situ hybridization procedure is described that enables detection and unequivocal identification of various developmental stages of human and rodent malaria parasites. Using biotinylated species-specific DNA probes, erythrocytic parasites can be specifically stained in blood smears. Similarly exoerythrocytic stages can be visualized in cell culture and in sections of paraffin-embedded liver. In blood smears, the hybridization procedure provides a rapid detection of (low) parasitemia and species-determination for experienced microscopists at 100 to 400x magnification. Moreover, the procedure can be applied even after previous Giemsa staining of the preparation, enabling revision of patient smears which were difficult to read after routine Giemsa staining.
