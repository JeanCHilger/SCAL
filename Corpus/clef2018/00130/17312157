A novel antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity mechanism involved in defense against malaria requires costimulation of monocytes FcgammaRII and FcgammaRIII. Clinical experiments have shown that the Ab-dependent cell-mediated inhibition of Plasmodium falciparum is a major mechanism controlling malaria parasitemia and thereby symptoms. In this study, we demonstrate that a single merozoite per monocyte (MN) is sufficient to trigger optimal antiparasitic activity. Using particulate Ag as pseudomerozoites, we show that only Ags, and no other parasite-derived factor, are required to trigger MN activation and that a single Ag is as potent as the complex combination of Ags constituting the merozoite surface. Moreover, we found that soluble Ags binding at least two Abs are as effective as the parasite at stimulating MN and that nonmalarial Ags are as efficient provided they are targeted by cytophilic Abs. Indeed, only cytophilic IgGs are potent and, in agreement with immunoepidemiological findings, IgG3 is superior to IgG1. Very low Ab concentrations (>700 pM), i.e., in the range of molecules having a hormonal effect, are effective, in contrast to Abs having a direct, neutralizing effect. Finally, Ab-dependent cell-mediated inhibition proved to require the synergistic activation of both FcgammaRIIa and FcgammaRIIIa which both distinguish it from other Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and implies that all MN are not equally effective. These findings have both fundamental and practical implications, particularly for vaccine discovery.
