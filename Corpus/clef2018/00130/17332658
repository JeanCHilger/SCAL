Operational feasibility of rapid diagnostic kits & blister packs use for malaria control in high transmission areas of Orissa & Chhattisgarh. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment of cases with malaria are two important components of malaria control strategy. The independent assessment of the operational feasibility of rapid diagnostic kits and blister packs for malaria in some selected high transmission areas of Orissa and Chhattisgarh was done with the objectives to assess the knowledge and skills of the paramedical personnel and their acceptability by the paramedical personnel and the community, and to assess improvement in patients' health seeking behaviour.The basic information regarding malaria situation, epidemiological divisions, distribution data of rapid diagnostic kits and blister packs, etc., was collected from State and district headquarters. The subcentres from the primary health centres/community health centres were selected on the basis of supply of rapid diagnostic kits and blister packs. The subcentres were visited and health personnel interviewed about their knowledge and skills on the use of rapid diagnostic kits and blister packs. A cross-sectional survey was conducted to assess the public opinion about rapid diagnostic kits and blister packs.We found that the paramedicals were well trained in the use of rapid diagnostic kits and blister pack administration and the acceptance was good by both paramedicals and general public. The compliance rate of radical treatment with blister packs was 100 per cent and no adverse events were reported.Our findings showed that rapid diagnostic kits and blister packs under remote and inaccessible highly malarious areas can be introduced that will have significant impact in reducing malaria morbidity and mortality.
