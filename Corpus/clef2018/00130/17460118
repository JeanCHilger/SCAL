Single-chain antibody fragment specific for Plasmodium vivax Duffy binding protein. Phage display of single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibodies is a powerful tool for selecting important, useful, and specific human antibodies. We constructed a library from three patients infected with Plasmodium vivax. Panning on recombinant PvRII enriched a population of scFvs that recognized region II of the P. vivax Duffy binding protein (DBP). Three clones of scFvs that reacted with PvRII were selected, and their biological functions were analyzed. These scFvs inhibited erythrocyte binding to DBP. Clone SFDBII92 had the greatest affinity (dissociation constant = 3.62 x 10(-8) M) and the greatest inhibition activity (50% inhibitory concentration approximately 2.9 microg/ml) to DBP. Thus, we demonstrated that human neutralizing antibody could be made from malaria patients using phage display and that these neutralizing scFvs should prove valuable for developing both passive and active immunization strategies based on DBP.
