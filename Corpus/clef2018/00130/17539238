IgG antibody profile to c-terminal region of Plasmodium vivax merozoite surface protein-1 in Thai individuals exposed to malaria. Naturally acquired immune response to C-terminal region of Plasmodium vivax merozoite surface protein1 (PvMSP1) in 200 individuals with recent clinical episodes of malaria from malaria endemic areas along Thai-Myanmar border in the west and Thai-Cambodia border in the east of Thailand was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The anti-PvMSP1-IgG antibody was observed in 110 individuals (55%). Among IgG responders, IgG1 coexpressed with IgG3 were the predominant subclasses. The levels of anti-PvMSP1 total IgG, IgG1 and IgG3 antibody response seem to be increased with age although no detectable significant correlation was found (r = 0.004, p = 0.484 for total IgG r = 0.035, p = 0.386 for IgG1
