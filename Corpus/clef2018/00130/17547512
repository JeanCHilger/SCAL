Advances in malaria diagnosis. Malaria is a leading cause of mortality worldwide and accurate diagnostic testing for malaria can potentially save an estimated 100,000 lives annually. New technologies have the potential to circumvent limitations of the traditional diagnostic method, light microscopy, which is labor intensive and requires considerable technician expertise. Immunochromatographic tests, which are easy to use in field conditions and relatively inexpensive, offer a potential solution to the problem of malaria overtreatment in resource-poor endemic countries. Assays based on the PCR are highly sensitive, can be used for unambiguous species identification and, thus, may increasingly complement or even replace light microscopy in developed countries. Experimental diagnostics using flow cytometry and mass spectrometry are currently under investigation for high-throughput screening.
