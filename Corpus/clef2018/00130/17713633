Evaluation of ICT malaria immunochromatographic Binax NOW ICT P.f/P.v test for rapid diagnosis of malaria in a Colombian endemic area. One of the strategies to reduce malarial morbidity and mortality is to make an early diagnosis, using simple rapid tests which are highly sensitive and specific. Furthermore, the tests must be easy to perform and understand by local people in such a way that a suitable and prompt antimalarial treatment is guaranteed.The sensitivity and specificity was determined for the immuno-chromographic malaria dipstick (ICT Pf/Pv) test for the rapid diagnosis of malaria in Turbo, Antioquia.The sample consisted of 171 patients distributed into two groups: the first group was 118 patients with acute febrile syndrome compatible with malaria to which ICT Pf/Pv and thick smears were applied simultaneously a second group was 53 patients with positive diagnosis by thick smear, with follow-up on the 4th and 7th days after beginning treatment.Sensitivity and specificity of the ICT Pf/Pv test for Plasmodium falciparum infections were 54.2% (95%CI: 52.0-53.4%) and 93.6% (95%CI: 93.1-94.2%), respectively. In addition, for Plasmodium vivax the sensitivity and specificity were 80% (95%CI: 77.9-82.1%) and 100% (95%CI: 99.5-100%) there was a 21.4% loss of sensitivity for P. falciparum 21.4% and a 33% loss for P. vivax malaria with parasitaemias under 500 parasites/ul. For the confirmatory test, ICT Pf/Pv showed a global sensitivity of 71.6% with 20.7% false positive and 5.6% false negative results. During follow-up, ICT showed 36% and 34% false positive results for day 4 and 7, respectively.The ICT Pf/Pv test has a poor sensitivity for P. falciparum malaria and its capacity to detect parasitemias under 500 parasites/ul is minimal. As a confirmatory test, the ICT Pf/Pv has a good sensitivity for P. falciparum. Its use for patient follow-up is not recommended.
