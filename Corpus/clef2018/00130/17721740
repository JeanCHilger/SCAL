Pulmonary edema due to Plasmodium vivax malaria in an American missionary. Pulmonary edema is a recognized complication of Plasmodium falciparum malaria but is uncommon with Plasmodium vivax infection. We report the case of a non-immune adult with imported P. vivax malaria who developed pulmonary edema during treatment. The case was further complicated by a recurrent malaria episode after failure of acute quinine and doxycycline treatment followed by terminal primaquine therapy. Prompt recognition and appropriate management of pulmonary edema is needed for optimal outcomes of P. vivax infection, as well as awareness of the potential failure of terminal therapy for liver hypnozoites.
