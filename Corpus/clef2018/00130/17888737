Prevention of malaria in long-term travelers. Long-term travellers have a high risk of acquiring malaria, and also of discontinuing malaria prophylaxis. A review by Lin Chen and colleagues addresses the relatively neglected area of malaria prevention in long-term travellers. The essential elements of malaria prevention are discussed: awareness of risk, bite avoidance, chemoprophylaxis, rapid diagnosis, stand-by emergency treatment, and the importance of tailoring recommendations to the individual.
