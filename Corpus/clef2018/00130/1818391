Detection of blood stage antigens of Plasmodium vivax by sandwich ELISA using pan-species monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antibodies. This paper reports an improved PcAb-McAb-ELISA test to detect blood stage Plasmodium vivax antigen in which the plates were coated with rabbit anti-P. cynomolgi polyclonal antibody to capture the antigens in test samples and two monoclonal antibodies, M26-32 and 3F9, were added together to react with the captured antigens. The coincidence rate with this test was 93% with microscopically confirmed P. vivax cases, 97% with normal samples, 95% with microscopically negative fever cases from nonendemic areas and 86% from endemic areas, respectively. The sensitivity was greater than 1 parasite/10(5) RBC.
