Inhibitory properties of the antibody response to Plasmodium vivax Duffy binding protein in an area with unstable malaria transmission. The function of the Plasmodium vivax Duffy binding protein (DBP) during the erythrocyte invasion process is critical for successful parasite growth and pathogenesis in human infections. Although DBP is the subject of intensive malaria vaccine research, investigations on the functional proprieties of anti-DBP antibodies in the human population have been limited [Infect Immun68 (2000) 3164]. In the present study, we examined the ability of sera from different populations of the Brazilian Amazon--an area of markedly unstable malaria transmission--to inhibit the erythrocyte-binding function of the DBP ligand domain (region II, DBP(II)). We found that long-term exposure to malaria in the Amazon area elicits DBP-specific antibodies that inhibit the binding of different DBP(II) variants to erythrocytes. Despite the great variability of inhibitory antibody responses observed among study participants, we observed a positive correlation between erythrocyte binding-inhibitory activity and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay anti-DBP antibodies. Of importance, there was a non-significant tendency towards increased levels of anti-DBP antibodies among individuals with asymptomatic P. vivax infections.
