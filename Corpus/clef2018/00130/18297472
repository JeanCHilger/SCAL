Background noise of infection for using ANCA as a diagnostic tool for vasculitis in tropical and developing countries. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) is often used in the laboratory to confirm paucicellular vasculitis like Wegener's granulomatosis, Churg Strauss syndrome or polyarteritis nodosa in the presence of suggestive clinical features. In tropical countries, tuberculosis, leprosy and, occasionally, malaria can produce clinical features similar to a vasculitic illness and all the three infections are known to be associated with auto antibodies. We tested 318 patients suffering from malaria, tuberculosis or leprosy for ANCA positivity. ANCA positivity was found in 19%, 32% and 30% of malaria, tuberculosis and leprosy patients (Pradhan V, Badakere S, Shankarkumar V, Iyer Y, Ghosh K, Karnad D, Indian J Malariol, 39:51-59, 2002 Pradhan V, Badakere S, Ghosh K, Pawar A, Indian J Med Sci, 58:283-288, 2004a
