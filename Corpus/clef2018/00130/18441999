Establishment and evaluation of colloid gold labeled immunochromatographic strip test for rapid diagnosis of malaria. To establish and evaluate a gold immunochromatographic strip test for detection and differentiation of Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum.The monoclonal antibodies, F4H12, G4C9 and D8F7, were conjugated with colloid gold as detecting reagent monoclonal antibody B2G10 (against P. vivax/ P. falciparum) and D6A7 (only against P. falciparum) were immobilized on nitrocellulose in proper position. Blood samples from 107 febrile patients from endemic area of malaria and 17 patients with visceral leishmaniasis were used for evaluating the specificity. Blood samples of malaria patients (110 with P. vivax and 54 with P. falciparum) were used for evaluating the sensitivity.5 samples out of 107 febrile patients and 17 patients with visceral leishmaniasis showed false positive reaction with a specificity of 96.0% (119/124), all the 17 samples from patients with visceral leishmaniasis were negative. 164 blood samples of malaria patients showed a sensitivity of 92.3% (153/164), 92.7% (102/110)and 94.4% (51/ 54) for patients infected with P. vivax or P. falciparum, respectively.The immunochromatographic strip test based on antigen-capturing is a sensitive, specific, simple and rapid assay for malaria diagnosis.
