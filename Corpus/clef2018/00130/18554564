Natural infectivity of Anopheles species from the Pacific and Atlantic Regions of Colombia. Malaria is an important public health problem in Colombia. Among the major vectors in Colombia, Anopheles albimanus is recognized for its importance on the Pacific Coast where it is the predominant species it is also found in the Atlantic Coast, although its vectorial role in this region is not clear. We examined the occurrence of An. albimanus in four localities of the Pacific and three of the Atlantic Coast. Morphological identification of problematic specimens was confirmed by a molecular assay. All identified mosquitoes at these sites, including An. albimanus, were also tested for malaria parasite infection. From 12,189 anophelines collected, 6370 were from the Pacific Coast, and corresponded to 99% An. albimanus, 0.8% Anopheles neivai, and three other species at <0.2%. From the Atlantic Coast we identified 5819 specimens with 61% An. albimanus, 36% Anopheles triannulatus s.l. and five other species at <2%. In both coasts, species present at lower percentages included several incriminated as vectors in neighboring countries. Six Pacific Coast specimens were infected with malaria parasites: four An. albimanus, two with Plasmodium vivax VK247, one with P. vivax VK210 and one with Plasmodium falciparum
