Prevalence and pattern of cross-reacting antibodies to HIV in patients with tuberculosis. In many countries, HIV testing among tuberculosis (TB) patients is recommended so that both infections are appropriately treated. Cross-reacting antibodies to HIV antigens have been reported for several conditions, including TB, leprosy, malaria, and rheumatoid arthritis. To study the pattern and prevalence of cross-reacting antibodies to HIV antigens, we examined sera from 153 HIV-negative TB patients and 40 healthy individuals in Chennai, south India. We also studied the differences in cross-reactivity of various HIV antigens using two different Western blot kits. Of the 153 samples studied, 80 were tested using HIV Western blot and 73 were tested using INNOLIA. Most patients in the study had concordantly negative ELISA and rapid tests, and no subject had a positive Western blot. However, seven TB patients had antibodies that cross-reacted with HIV antigens, giving rise to an indeterminate result. While p51/55 was the most frequently recognized antigen in the Western blot assay, antibodies to sgp120 was most frequently identified in INNOLIA. Sequence similarities between the two organisms could be responsible for eliciting cross-reacting antibodies, since a few related epitopes were identified in HIV and Mycobacterium. These findings could have potential implications for the development of diagnostics and vaccines.
