The usefulness of a new rapid diagnostic test, the First Response Malaria Combo (pLDH/HRP2) card test, for malaria diagnosis in the forested belt of central India. Malaria presents a diagnostic challenge in tribal belt of central India where two Plasmodium species, Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, are prevalent. In these areas, rapid detection of the malaria parasites and early treatment of infection remain the most important goals of disease management. Therefore, the usefulness of a new rapid diagnostic (RDT), the First Response(R) Combo Malaria Ag (pLDH/HRP2) card test was assessed for differential diagnosis between P. falciparum with other Plasmodium species in remote villages of Jabalpur district.A finger prick blood sample was collected to prepare blood smear and for testing with the RDT after taking informed consent. The figures for sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and predictive values were calculated using microscopy as gold standard.Analysis revealed that overall, the RDT was 93% sensitive, 85% specific with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 79%, and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 95%. The accuracy 88% and J-index was 0.74. For P. falciparum, the sensitivity and specificity of the test were 96% and 95% respectively, with a PPV of 85% and a NPV of 99%. The RDT accuracy 95% and J-index was 0.84. For non-falciparum malaria, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 83%, 94% and 92% respectively with a PPV of 69% and a NPV of 97%.The RDTs are easy to use, reliable and simple to interpret. RDTs are more suited to health workers in situations where health services are deficient or absent. Therefore, the test can be used as an epidemiological tool for the rapid screening of malaria.
