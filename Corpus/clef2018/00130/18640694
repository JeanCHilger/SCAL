Febrile illness at the emergency department of Cayenne Hospital, French Guiana. Febrile illness is a common cause of attendance at emergency departments. The purpose of this study was to describe infectious aetiologies of fever in a tropical setting. We prospectively included 1443 febrile patients, all French Guiana residents, who presented at Cayenne Hospital emergency department. This report will propose an overview of aetiologies of febrile illness in French Guiana, and tropical diseases such as malaria and arbovirus infections are discussed. Almost 30% of fevers remained unexplained. Further prospective multicentre studies are warranted to improve the diagnosis of overlooked pathogens in French Guiana. Such studies would lead to conclusions of specific interest in the travel medicine field.
