Identification of four species of human malaria parasites by fast PCR. Malaria is one of the most prevalent infectious diseases in the world. Accurate identification of four species of human malaria parasite is essential for appropriate treatment. Here, we developed a simple and rapid method of identifying Plasmodium species using a fast polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Based on the previous literature, we amplified small subunit ribosomal RNA genes of four human malaria parasites. To establish a minimum detection limit, a blood sample with a known number of P. falciparum parasites (parasitemia: 3%) was diluted serially(from 0.03% to 0.000003%). We compared the detection limits between single (one-step) PCR and nested (two-step) PCR. Other clinical blood samples, which were infected with P. falciparum (parasitemia: 2.8%), P. vivax (parasitemia: 0.13%), P. ovale (parasitemia: 0.04%), respectively, were also tested by our PCR system. The PCR findings were compared to those of blood film Giemsa staining and rapid diagnostic tests (RDT). The sensitivity of our method is less than one parasite in 1 microl of blood(estimated parasitemia: 0.000003%) for both single PCR and nested PCR, though an increased number of cycles (40 cycles) was required for single PCR. Using clinical samples, it was proven that amplified products by single PCR could clearly distinguish between P. falciparum, P. vivax, and P. ovale. To detect P. vivax and P. ovale, the PCR system was more sensitive than RDT. The total required time for our method was within three to four hours from DNA extraction to PCR detection. Taken together, our method is easier and faster than the previously reported PCR-based malaria parasite identification systems, and is also useful for cases in which diagnosis by Giemsa staining and RDT is difficult.
