Human response to a malaria vaccine candidate antigen. The Plasmodium falciparum heat-shock protein 70 (PFHSP70) has been proposed as a potential candidate antigen for a malaria vaccine. In this study the human immune response to this antigen has been evaluated. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were performed on serum samples collected from individuals during and after malarial infection. Only 70% of falciparum malaria patients responded to this antigen during the natural course of infection and 54% of the recovered cases who had no parasitaemia at the time of blood collection lacked detectable antibody. The non-responders to PFHSP70 exhibited an antibody response to total schizont antigens. There was no correlation between the response against total schizont antigens and PFHSP70 antigen. The non-responsiveness against PFHSP70 was not related to age, sex or regional variations. These qualities are undesirable for a vaccine candidate antigen.
