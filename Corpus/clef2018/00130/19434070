Moving candidate vaccines into development from research: lessons from HIV. There is a logarithmic increase in the cost and complexity of the research and development process when transitioning a promising candidate vaccine from the laboratory into the clinic. Managing complex development programs involving people from diverse technical, cultural and geographical backgrounds is a specialised skill. It is essential that the group is clear on their objectives and how their activities affect others, that communication is open, inclusive and effective, and that the most rigorous, scientific approach based on statistical principles in compliance with regulatory requirements is used. Applying these standards to all vaccine development programs will filter out inappropriate candidates more readily and enhance the efficiency of vaccine development. The challenges of developing a new vaccine are illustrated in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccinology. Selecting vaccine candidates for HIV requires the ability to evaluate the large number of potential antigens in imperfect and non-standardised animal models. Further, using these models to evaluate questions such as dose scaling to humans, optimal route of administration, the use of adjuvants and potential formulation improvements adds variable to variable, making the interpretation of results particularly challenging. This may lead to the promotion of a poor candidate or the elimination of a good one. The absence of precise immunological correlates of protection and the prohibitive cost of confirmatory clinical trials are further significant barriers. However, there are practical steps that can be taken to standardise early vaccine evaluation, which would result in more efficient development of new vaccines for HIV and other disease areas with similarly challenging development issues (such as hepatitis C virus, influenza, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and malaria).
