Genetic control of the immune response to a synthetic vaccine against Plasmodium falciparum. Two independent vaccination trials using a hybrid synthetic polypeptide containing epitopes from four proteins of Plasmodium falciparum were performed. In the first trial 63 and in the second 122 volunteers were vaccinated, using different immunization schedules. The analysis of the humoral response to the vaccine, measured by IgG antibody titres to the polypeptide showed a bimodal distribution in both cases suggesting genetic control of the immune response to this protein. There was a small group of low or non-responders and a large group of good responders. HLA phenotyping of the two groups disclosed an association of the low responders to HLA-DR4 antigens with chi-square P value of 0.00039 when compared with the good responders group. These findings provide evidence for the genetic control of the immune response to the synthetic vaccine by the association of this response with particular alleles of the HLA class II antigens such findings may lead to an explanation of the mechanism involved in disease susceptibility and need to be used in the design of a totally effective vaccine.
