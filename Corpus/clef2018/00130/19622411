Chapter 5. Potential contribution of sero-epidemiological analysis for monitoring malaria control and elimination: historical and current perspectives. Anti-malarial antibody responses represent an individual's history of exposure to the disease and, as age sero-conversion rates, reflect cumulative malaria exposure in a population. As such these antibody responses are an alternate measure of malaria transmission intensity and have potential in evaluating changes in exposure. This approach was used in the 1970s to evaluate malaria control and eradication attempts in a variety of different ecological settings. These historical studies provided a wealth of information on how serological data might be used to interpret control measures. However they were limited by a lack of standardized antigens and reproducible high-throughput assays. Current techniques using recombinant antigens with a range of immunogenicities, high-throughput enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and statistical analysis allow a more robust examination of how serological parameters can be used to evaluate factors affecting malaria transmission. Here we present a review of the historical data and use it to assess the serological contribution to monitoring malaria elimination.
