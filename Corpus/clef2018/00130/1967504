Evaluation of an ELISA kit for epidemiological detection of antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites in human sera and bloodspot eluates. Antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites represent a serological transmission indicator, which can be applied in epidemiological studies to estimate the intensity of malaria transmission. An ELISA method has been developed as an industrial kit to detect these antibodies, using a chemically synthesized (NANP)40 peptide as antigen. The results obtained with this kit are compared in the present paper with those obtained by an ELISA test already applied in epidemiological studies. In testing sera from individuals living in endemic areas, a high diagnostic concordance (92.1%) was obtained between the two assays. The absorbances of these sera correlated well, as shown by a correlation coefficient r = 0.877. Sera from individuals never exposed to malaria gave very low absorbances with the kit. This minimum non-specific binding increases the probability of comparable results in different studies. When the two ELISAs were evaluated for analytical sensitivity and precision, similar satisfactory results were achieved. The test can be performed not only with sera but also with eluates from filterpaper bloodspots. Modifications of the kit to reduce its cost and suggestions regarding distribution and funding are also proposed.
