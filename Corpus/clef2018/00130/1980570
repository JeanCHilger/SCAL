Antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum in an indigenous population from a malaria endemic area of Malaysia. Indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) tests and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were used to measure antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum in an indigenous population in an area of Malaysia with high malaria prevalence. The results of three surveys were analyzed to examine the relation of these serologic measures with age, parasite rate, and spleen size. For children 0-4 years old, increasing spleen size was associated with an increasing likelihood of malaria parasitemia, while for 5-9 year olds the two variables were unrelated. Parasite rate declined with age and ELISA titre increased with age in all surveys IFA titre was consistently high and did not vary with age. Neither antibody measure was significantly correlated with either the presence or the actual density of parasitemia. These antibody measures are most useful as adjuncts to the more traditional techniques of malaria assessment.
