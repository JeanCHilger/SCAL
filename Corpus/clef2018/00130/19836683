Imported malaria: diagnostic traps and rapid tests. Imported malaria is a disease prevalent in France: 6,000 to 8,000 cases a year, of which 15% are pediatric cases. Despite this high incidence, the diagnosis is often delayed. The patient may then evolve to a severe form. This diagnostic delay is due to non-specific clinical symptoms in children. The most common symptoms are fever and digestive disorders (diarrhea, vomiting). In the absence of thrombocytopenia, the laboratory tests are not very useful for diagnosis. Parasitological examinations are dependent on the experience of the biologist, particularly in cases of low parasitemia as those observed in children who have received partial chemoprophylaxis. The recent introduction of rapid tests based on the detection of Plasmodium proteins, allows emergency remedy to this problem. The blood smears remains the gold standard and has to be used to confirm the results of rapid tests. If rapid tests improve the detection of Plasmodium in 2009, it remains mandatory to evoke the diagnosis of malaria in any febrile child coming from an endemic area.
