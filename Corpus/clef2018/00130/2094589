Interferon-alpha and synthetic peptide malaria sporozoite vaccine in non-immune adults: antibody response after 40 weeks. Adults with no known immunity to sporozoites received, i.m., at weeks 0 and 8 two single 200 micrograms doses of a peptide Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite vaccine conjugated to tetanus toxoid ((NANP)3-TT) plus placebo (group 1) or interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) (group 2) and were followed for antibody responses at weeks 4, 12 and 40. Peak antibody responses were observed at week 12. At week 40, a greater than or equal to 4-fold increase in antibody titre to sporozoites in IFA, or to (NANP)50 in ELISA was still detectable in 6 of 12 (50%) volunteers in group 1 and in 16 of 25 (64%) in group 2. Peak antibody titres in IFA and ELISA decreased with a rate of 0.8% and 0.5% per week, respectively.
