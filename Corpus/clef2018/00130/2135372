The immunoenzymatic assay (ELISA) in the serodiagnosis of Plasmodium vivax. ELISA was evaluated for the serodiagnosis of Plasmodium vivax using homologous antigen. This was a crude fraction obtained after detergent (NP-40) lysis of human parasitized red blood cells. Antibodies of the classes IgM, IgG, IgA were determined in a pool of eleven sera from patients with P. vivax malaria. The protein A was introduced as secondary probe to screen P. vivax antibodies in 30 sera of patients harbouring a first episode of P. vivax malaria. There was a correlation of 93% with the parasitological diagnosis and the test resulted specific and reproducible.
