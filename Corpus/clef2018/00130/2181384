Consecutive determinations of seroreactivities to Pf 155/RESA antigen and to its different repetitive sequences in adult men from a holoendemic area of Liberia. Sera from 32 adult men residing in a malaria holoendemic area of Liberia were investigated for seroreactivities to different asexual blood-stage malaria antigens on five consecutive occasions from 1984 to 1986. The seroreactivities to crude parasitic antigens and to Pf 155/RESA (EMIF) were determined by immunofluorescence and to repetitive sequences of Pf 155/RESA by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). All sera were highly reactive against the crude parasitic antigens with reciprocal titres varying from 5000 to 100,000. The EMIF titres showed a wider variation from negative (less than 10) to 25,000, and when the same individuals were re-examined on subsequent surveys similar EMIF titres were found. The ELISA seroreactivities to three different repetitive sequences of Pf 155/RESA also showed different individual profiles which were rather consistent on consecutive surveys. High EMIF titres appeared to be correlated mainly to one of the peptide sequences, namely (EENV)2. The consistent individual profiles of the seroreactivities to Pf 155 and its repetitive sequences suggest genetic restriction of the humoral immune response. Although no significant correlation was found between EMIF titres and parasitic densities in the adult hyperimmune men the specific peptides, however, offer new possibilities of further investigating protective capacities of different immune responses to specific epitopes of the malaria parasite.
