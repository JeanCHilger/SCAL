Antibodies to the ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen and the circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium falciparum in a rural community from Burkina Faso. A population-based study in Burkina Faso was conducted to determine, under conditions of natural exposure to malaria parasites, the prevalence rate and seasonal variation of antibodies to the repeated amino acid sequences of the Plasmodium falciparum ring-infected erythrocyte antigen (RESA) and the circumsporozoite (CS) protein, and the relationship of the presence of malaria parasites in the blood with the level of these antibodies. A random sample of households was selected and visited twice during 1988, in April just before the rainy season and in September at the end of the rainy season. Serological testing included an immunofluorescent assay for total anti-blood stage antibodies a modified immunofluorescent assay on glutaraldehyde-fixed parasitized erythrocytes to detect antibodies to RESA
