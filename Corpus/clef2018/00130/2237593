Competitive antibody binding inhibition ELISA for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum antigen. A competitive antibody binding inhibition ELISA to detect Plasmodium falciparum-infected cells in clinical specimens was developed. Optimum conditions developed included: 12.5 micrograms/ml of P. falciparum antigen for plate coating, 25 micrograms/ml of polyclonal rabbit anti-P. falciparum IgG, 30 minute incubation of a mixture of infected red blood cell extract with anti-P. falciparum IgG, dilution of 1:500 of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, and reading of the absorbance values 60 min after adding the p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate. Reproducibility of the assay against cultured P. falciparum-infected red blood cells varied according to parasitemia, the higher the parasitemia, the better the reproducibility. The sensitivity of the assay was approximately 110 parasites/10(6) red blood cells. The assay was applied to field conditions involving 103 cases with falciparum malaria, 38 cases with vivax malaria and 30 healthy controls. With the 10% antibody binding inhibition as a cutoff, 87.4% of falciparum cases and 26.3% of vivax cases were positive. After treatment, the majority of cases became parasitologically negative with the corresponding negative assay. Regression analysis showed only weak but statistically significant correlation between the percent inhibition with parasitemia (r = 0.38, p less than 0.001), and this was more clearly shown in patients with high parasitemia.
