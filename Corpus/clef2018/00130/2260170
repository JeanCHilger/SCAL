Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the diagnosis of kala-azar in Bhadohi (Varanasi), India. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) developed using Leishmania donovani promastigote soluble antigen gave positive responses in practically all the clinically and parasitologically diagnosed patients with kala-azar in a preliminary study. Healthy control subjects from non-endemic and endemic areas gave negative results. No cross-reaction was observed with patients having leprosy, filariasis, malaria, tuberculosis, or amoebiasis. Blood samples collected on filter paper were adequate for the test. The test appears promising in the diagnosis of kala-azar.
