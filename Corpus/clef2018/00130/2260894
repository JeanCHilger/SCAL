Detection of malaria endemicity in community villages in North Sumatra, Indonesia by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. An enzyme linked immunosorbent assay for malaria was used in North Sumatra, Indonesia as an epidemiological survey tool. The seroepidemiological investigation was concentrated on junior high schools. Serum samples obtained were classified according to the villages of origin of the students. The mean of ELISA values of each village group was compared with the parasite rate in primary schools in their native villages. A good correlation was observed between them (r = 0.96). The present results indicate that a survey of malaria in junior high schools by ELISA could give useful information on malaria prevalence in several peripheral villages. Province-wide information on malaria prevalence could easily be obtained by malaria-ELISA in junior high schools in tropical rural area.
