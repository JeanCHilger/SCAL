Malaria in the Amazon. Prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum antibodies in Amerindians inhabiting the Venezuelan Amazon. The acquisition of antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum in various age groups was studied in 511 Amerindians inhabiting the north of the Venezuelan Amazon. The overall prevalence by ELISA was 91.2% and antibodies were acquired early in life. Seropositivity was 69.6% in the group aged two to five years and reached 86% at 10 years of age 96.9% of the adults aged 31-40 years exhibited high ELISA values to P. falciparum. The high prevalence of malaria antibodies among Amazonians, from early on in life, reflects the high level of malaria transmission in that part of the world.
