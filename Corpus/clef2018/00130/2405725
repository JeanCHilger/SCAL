An ABC-ELISA for malaria serology in the field. An avidin biotin peroxidase complex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ABC-ELISA) was examined for the diagnosis of malaria in a controlled area in Sudan Gezira. The titers of the ABC-ELISA coincided with those of the IFAT. The method was more sensitive than the ordinary ELISA as the final enzyme reaction was amplified through the use of the ABC system. This allowed the resulting color spots on the dried plate wells to be read clearly with the naked eye. This test can be carried out without using major electrical equipment.
