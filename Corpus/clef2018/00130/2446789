Value of rapid diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum using indirect monoclonal immunofluorescence. Development and use of murine specific monoclonal antibodies associated with an indirect immunofluorescent assay allows a rapid detection of P. falciparum antigens. This work compares the results obtained by interpretation of Giemsa staining technique on blood smears, to the use of a commercial reagent (Monofluo Kit P. falciparum). This monoclonal indirect immunofluorescent assay (I.F.I.M.) provides the clinician with a precious aid to diagnosis as well by its specificity and sensitivity, better than conventional staining techniques particularly in pauciparasitaemia induced by prime-infestation or partial anti-malarial drug resistance.
