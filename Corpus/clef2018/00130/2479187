Effects of interferons on immune response to a synthetic peptide malaria sporozoite vaccine in non-immune adults. A Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite vaccine, composed of a synthetic dodecapeptide (NANP)3 coupled to tetanus toxoid (TT), was injected, at weeks 0 and 8, into non-immune volunteers in two randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials. In the first trial, 37 volunteers received the vaccine simultaneously with placebo (group 1), 0.5 x 10(6-) (group 2), or 1.5 x 10(6) U (group 3) of recombinant human interferon-alpha (= IFN-alpha). In the second trial, 35 other volunteers received the vaccine with placebo (group 4), 0.25 x 10(6) (group 5), or 1.0 x 10(6) IU (group 6) of interferon-gamma (= IFN-gamma). Immunizations were well tolerated and resulted in seroconversion rates (greater than or equal to 4-fold increase of antibody titre in immunofluorescence or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays) of 67-100% of volunteers. IFN-alpha significantly enhanced the IgG antibody titres in ELISA to malaria peptide.
