Differential antibody responses to Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax circumsporozoite proteins in a human population. Papua New Guineans exposed to hyperendemic malaria in the Madang area showed different antibody responses to Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax sporozoites despite comparable entomological inoculation rates. Although there was a significant trend of increasing prevalence of anti-P. falciparum circumsporozoite (CS) protein immunoglobulin G (IgG) with age, there was no significant increase in the antibody units of IgG recognizing P. falciparum CS proteins. Antibodies recognizing P. vivax CS proteins steadily increased in prevalence and antibody units with age. Significant trends of increasing prevalence of antibody responders (both IgG and IgM) with increasing splenic enlargement were found in the younger age groups for P. falciparum CS proteins but not for P. vivax CS proteins. When antibody responders were analyzed by quartiles, there was a trend of increasing antibody response with age against P. vivax CS peptide, but not for P. falciparum CS protein. There was no evidence for increasing protection against blood-stage infections with increasing antibody levels for either P. falciparum or P. vivax. Neither were any significant relationships found between entomological inoculation rates and either CS antibody prevalence or concentration among the villages studied.
