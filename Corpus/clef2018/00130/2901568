Hypohaptoglobinaemia as an epidemiological and clinical indicator for malaria. Results of two studies in a hyperendemic region in West Africa. Hypohaptoglobinaemia is a common phenomenon in tropical countries, where it is probably due to malaria-induced haemolysis. Two studies were carried out in a hyperendemic zone of West Africa to test its specificity and usefulness as an epidemiological indicator for measuring malaria endemicity. The first study evaluated the prevalence of hypohaptoglobinaemia before and after courses of antimalarial chemotherapy of varying duration. The second monitored haptoglobin levels in an untreated population during a whole year to compare its seasonal variations with those of several classic indicators of malaria. These studies suggest that in regions where malaria is endemic the prevalence of hypohaptoglobinaemia could be as useful an indicator as the parasitic index but would be much easier to establish and to monitor.
