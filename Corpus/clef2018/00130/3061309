Interaction of Malaysian sera with Plasmodium vivax sporozoite antigen. A seroepidemiologic survey of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum transmission was conducted in 94 Orang Asli children and adults. The prevalence of malaria was 46% in this population, and infections due to P. vivax and P. falciparum occurred with equal frequency. Multi-species infection was common, particularly in children less than 10 years of age. Circumsporozoite (CS) antibodies to P. vivax were detected by ELISA, using the recombinant protein NS181V20, in sera from 53-95% of all subjects in this study. The specificity of reactivity to NS181V20 was confirmed by immunofluorescence using air-dried sporozoites. CS antibodies to P. falciparum were present in less than 50% of the population less than 30 years of age. These data support further testing of this protein as a candidate vivax vaccine.
