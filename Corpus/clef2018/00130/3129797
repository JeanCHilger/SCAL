Diffusion-in-gel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, ELISA and IFA test in the detection of malarial antibodies. Malarial antibodies in 80 patients were measured using the diffusion-in-gel enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (DIG-ELISA), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test. Good correlations were obtained between all three tests in terms of sensitivity and reliability. DIG-ELISA has the advantage of being a rapid diagnostic tool for the detection of malarial antibodies.
