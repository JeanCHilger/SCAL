A sensitive malaria immunoperoxidase assay for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum antibody. A new and rapid malaria immunoperoxidase assay using the enzyme horseradish peroxidase in place of fluorescein isothiocyanate was developed to allow the serological measurement of antimalarial antibody by light microscopy. Acetone-fixed thin blood films prepared from cultured Plasmodium falciparum were used as the source of antigen. This malaria immunoperoxidase assay is as sensitive as, and occasionally more sensitive than, the indirect fluorescent antibody assay. It is easy to perform and the antigen used does not show cross-reactivity with sera from nonmalarial diseases.
