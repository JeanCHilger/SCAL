Detection and semiquantitative determination of antibodies against Plasmodium falciparum in human blood serum: NBT-reduction by polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) has been employed for the detection of specific opsonizing antibodies against Plasmodium falciparum in sera from individuals exposed to malaria parasites. Specific antibody-antigen complex is known to trigger the metabolic activation of normal PMN, as measured by NBT-test. In the sera from 16 out of 17 patients tested the NBT-reduction of normal PMN was, in the presence of P. falciparum antigen, significantly higher than that obtained with pooled normal serum from individuals without malaria background. This enhancement was more pronounced in the presence of complement. NBT-reduction was elevated to a lower extent when human anti-P. falciparum sera were substituted with anti-P. vivax or P. ovale sera. Furthermore, no enhancement was noted when red blood cells lysate was used as antigen. The results indicated the presence of specific opsonizing antibodies against P. falciparum in the patient sera. Oxygen-derived free radicals formed by PMN during the stimulation are suggested as the neutrophil mediated protection against malaria.
