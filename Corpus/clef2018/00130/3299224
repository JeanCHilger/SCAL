Plasmodium falciparum-inhibitory monoclonal antibodies produced by human hybridomas. Stable human hybridomas were generated that produced inhibitory anti-Plasmodium falciparum monoclonal antibodies. Peripheral blood lymphocytes, obtained from adults in Liberia, a malaria endemic area, were immortalized with Epstein-Barr virus and then fused with KR4, a human, lymphoblastoid cell line. Stable hybridomas that produced anti-P. falciparum monoclonal antibody were identified by an ELISA assay that used the trophozoite and schizont antigens of both the Honduras I and FCR3 parasite strains. Monoclonal antibodies produced by selected hybridomas derived from lymphocytes of two individuals were subsequently studied. The anti-parasite antibodies were produced at 1-3 micrograms/ml in culture supernatants. All of the monoclonal antibodies bound specifically to trophozoites and schizonts of both strains of parasite in an indirect immunofluorescence assay and inhibited production of ring stage parasites by more than 90% when added to trophozoite or schizont containing erythrocytes in culture. Western immunoblot analysis of antigens obtained from trophozoites and schizonts (parasite age span of 36 to 48 h) was performed using either affinity purified or ammonium sulfate-concentrated monoclonal antibody. Antibody from three hybridomas which bound primarily to antigens of the Honduras 1 strain had Mr of approximately 140,000, 130,000 and 123,000.
