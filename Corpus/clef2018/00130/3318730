Studies on in vitro culture supernatant of P. falciparum. Isolation of antigens for serology. Twenty-four-hour-old in vitro culture supernatant of Plasmodium falciparum was collected and a comparative study was carried out using supernatant antigen and antigen prepared from in vitro culture of P. falciparum parasites in ELISA with sera from slide-positive malaria cases. The results were comparable, and in certain cases higher ELISA readings were observed with the supernatant antigen.
