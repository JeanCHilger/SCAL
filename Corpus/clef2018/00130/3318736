Malaria chemoprophylaxis to pregnant women provided by community health workers in Saradidi, Kenya. III. Serologic studies. Parasitaemia and antimalarial antibodies were examined from May 1983 to March 1984 in monthly samples taken from 930 pregnant women attending antenatal clinics in Saradidi, Kenya, and 317 of their infants 104 women were taking chloroquine phosphate 300 mg base weekly for chemoprophylaxis. Seropositivity rates in pregnant women were uniformly high, and mean enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) absorbance values were not related to presence of parasitaemia or history of chemoprophylaxis. Parasitaemia was present in 26.5% of 1677 slides from pregnant women and there was little variation by month of sample. Mean ELISA absorbance values varied by month of sample. Seropositivity rates in infants were high as measured in both the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test (81.6% of 938) and ELISA at 1:100 (83.8% of 1025) and 1:1000 (34.8% of 1025) serum dilutions. Seropositivity rates decreased slightly after birth but by four months of age rates were again high. Parasitaemia was present in 26.5% of 1677 slides from pregnant women. Paired comparisons were made on maternal samples collected less than two months before parturition and samples from the infants collected within two months after birth. The paired antibody response by IFA or ELISA was not dependent on the presence of detectable parasitaemia in the mother. Infants from mothers with a history of antimalarial chemoprophylaxis had significantly (P = 0.04) lower IFA titres than other infants. Measuring the absorbance of a 1:100 serum dilution by ELISA appeared to be an excellent method with which to measure longitudinal serologic changes in a population.
