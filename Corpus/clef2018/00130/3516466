Characterization of the humoral immune response in Plasmodium falciparum malaria. III. Factors influencing the coexpression of antibody isotypes (IgM and IgG-1 to 4). Isotypes (IgM and IgG-1 to 4) of anti-P. falciparum antibodies were investigated in sera of malarial patients or immune donors by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and two indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFAs), one staining intra-erythrocytic parasites of all stages and the other a restricted number of parasite antigens deposited in the membrane of infected erythrocytes by invading merozoites (Perlmann & Wahlgren, 1983 Perlmann et al., 1984, Wahlgren et al., 1985a). There was no correlation in overall antibody titres between the two IFAs. Antibodies of both IgM and all four IgG isotypes were detected in both assays. With the IFA for intracellular parasites a brilliant fluorescence was obtained with antibodies of all isotypes. However IgG-2 antibodies often gave staining restricted to the surface of schizonts. The incidence and reactivity in individual sera of antibodies of the different isotypes did not relate to the immune status of the donors (acute infection or clinically immune) but related well to the degree of malarial exposure as reflected by the overall antibody titres. This, in all three assays, high titred sera frequently contained antibodies of all isotypes while low titred sera usually only contained antibodies of IgM, IgG-1 and IgG-3 isotype. On average, the overall expression of antibodies of different isotypes in individual sera appears to reflect a sequential downstream (5' to 3') activation of the corresponding Igh-C genes in P. falciparum specific B-cell clones.
