Cross-sectional seroepidemiological survey of malaria in endemic areas with different activities of malaria control. A single cross-sectional seroepidemiological survey of malaria antibody was conducted in 1982 in Klang District, Rayong Province in three villages under different phases of malaria control activity to determine whether a single survey could be used to delineate malaria endemicity in Thailand and to compare the usefulness of ELISA and the indirect haemagglutination test (IHA) in the assessment of malaria endemicity. Village 11 was a control area with high infection rate with an annual slide positive rate of 16.3% in 1981. Village 6 was also a control area but was in the late attack phase in which residual insecticide spraying has been ceased since 1976. Village 7 was a consolidation area. Finger-tipped blood was collected from 189, 191 and 132 individuals from villages 11, 6 and 7 respectively, and the plasma tested for anti-P. falciparum antibody with ELISA and IHA. With ELISA, it was shown that the seropositive rate in population of village 11 (84.6%) was significantly higher than those of other two villages (48.9% in village 6 and 28.8% in village 7). After age stratification, it was shown that the differences were observed in every age group except in the greater than or equal to 45 year age group of village 6. With IHA, a significantly higher seropositive rates in population of village 11 was evident when they were compared with the corresponding age groups of 6-14, 15-29 and 30-44 years in village 7, and the age group of less than or equal to 5 year in village 6.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
