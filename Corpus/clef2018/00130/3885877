Malaria and haemoglobin genotype in young northern Nigerian children. Plasmodium falciparum and P. malariae were found less frequently in blood obtained from Nigerian children under the age of two years who had the haemoglobin genotype AS than in blood films obtained from those who had the genotype AA. However, differences between the two groups were statistically significant only for P. falciparum asexual forms. The prevalence of malaria antibodies, as measured by an ELISA, did not differ significantly between the two groups.
