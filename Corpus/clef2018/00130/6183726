Anti-plasmodium falciparum monoclonal antibodies. Preliminary results. P. falciparum grown in culture was used to immunize mice and to obtain hybridomas. Two hybrids were selected secreting high titers of monoclonal antibodies directed against the cytoplasm of erythrocytic forms of the Plasmodium and not against the membrane of normal or parasitized erythrocytes. Such antibodies are of potential value in the immuno-diagnosis of malaria.
