Diagnosis of fever in a patient returning from black Africa (author's transl). The diagnostic problems which arise when fever occurs in a patient returning from black Africa are more and more frequently encountered because of the multiplication of rapid connections with this continent. Analysis of the main etiologies leads the author to review most of the specifically tropical diseases. However, cosmopolitan diseases should not be underrated. The author emphasizes the high incidence of pernicious malaria, liver amebiasis, and typho-paratyphoid fevers, along with the necessity of keeping in mind the new viral diseases (Lassa, Marburg, Ebola).
