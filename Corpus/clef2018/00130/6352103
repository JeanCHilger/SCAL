Characterization of the humoral immune response in Plasmodium falciparum malaria. II. IgG subclass levels of anti-P. falciparum antibodies in different sera. The IgG subclass levels of anti-Plasmodium falciparum antibodies in human sera were determined in ELISA with monoclonal mouse antibodies specific for the human IgG subclasses as analytical reagents. The parasite antigen was a trophozoite/schizont enriched preparation of in vitro cultivated P. falciparum. Serum samples were from Swedish malaria patients and adult Liberians. Parasite specific antibodies were found in all four subclasses. Relatively elevated levels of IgG1 antibodies were found both in Swedish patients and in the Liberians. Relative to the Liberians, high IgG2 antibody levels were seen in most Swedish patients. In Liberian sera but not in those from Swedish patients elevated IgG3 levels were found. In two Swedish patients followed consecutively for a period of 15 weeks, elevated levels of IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies were seen after relapse. No differences between the groups in regard to the levels of IgG4 antibodies were noticed. The differences between the Swedish patients and the Liberians were also in part reflected by differences in the total amounts of the four IgG subclasses.
