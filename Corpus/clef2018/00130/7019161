Quantitative carbon-14 autoradiography at the cellular level: principles and application for cell kinetic studies. Amounts of radio-labelled substances as low as 10(-18) moles incorporated into individual cells can be measured by utilizing techniques of quantitative autoradiography. For this purpose, radioactive standard sources are processed with the labelled cells smeared to slides. Carbon-14 is a favourable isotope with regard to minimal loss of beta-disintegrations due to self-absorption, and to limited cross-fire effects complicating the attribution of silver grains to individual cells. Silver grain densities can be counted by automated microphotometry allowing on-line data processing by an interfaced computer. Rate measurements of 14C-thymidine incorporation into individual cells yield values of the DNA synthesis rate provided that the endogenous pathway of thymidine-phosphate formation has been previously blocked. From the rate values of individual cells the DNA synthesis time of a cell compartment is derived. This is an essential time parameter for the evaluation of kinetic events in proliferating cell populations. This method is applicable to human cells without radiation hazard to man, and provides an optimal source of detailed information on the kinetics of normal and diseased human haematopoiesis. Examples of application consist of thalassaemia, malaria infection, iron deficiency anaemia and acute myelogenous leukaemia.
