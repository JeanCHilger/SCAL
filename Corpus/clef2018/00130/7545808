Epitopes in the 19kDa fragment of the Plasmodium falciparum major merozoite surface protein-1 (PfMSP-1(19)) recognized by human antibodies. The antibody response to two different epitopes located in the C-terminal 19kDa fragment of the Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1(19)) has been studied using a competitive ELISA based on the inhibition of monoclonal antibody (MoAb) binding by serum samples. Sera from children aged three to eight years who suffered clinical symptoms of malaria, or were partially immune with an asymptomatic infection, and from adults all living in The Gambia, West Africa were tested. The results suggest that the antibody response to MSP-1(19) has a role in naturally-acquired immunity in Gambian individuals.
