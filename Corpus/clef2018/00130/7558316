Relationship between maternally derived anti-Plasmodium falciparum antibodies and risk of infection and disease in infants living in an area of Liberia, west Africa, in which malaria is highly endemic. In areas where Plasmodium falciparum is endemic, immunoglobulin G is acquired by the fetus in utero, mainly during the third trimester of pregnancy. The potential protective effect of transferred anti-P. falciparum maternal antibodies was examined in a longitudinal study of 100 infants from birth to 1 year of age. The probability of acquiring a P. falciparum infection and developing an episode of clinical malaria was determined in relation to the P. falciparum-specific antibody level of the infant at birth against P. falciparum schizont antigen or recombinant merozoite surface protein MSP1(19) antigen. The risk of acquiring an episode of clinical malaria increased from birth to 6 months of age, after which it decreased. The overall prevalence of P. falciparum parasitemia was highest (48.9%) in the 6-month-old infants. The age-specific hematocrit value showed the lowest mean value (30.2) from 6 to 9 months, and the spleen rate was the highest (69.8%) at the same age. There was a lower risk of developing an episode of clinical malaria during the first year of life in the infants with high levels of anti-MSP1(19) antibodies at birth. The level of maternally derived overall anti-schizont antigen antibodies did not seem to play a role in the relative risk of developing malaria infection or disease during the first year of life, though the level of specific anti-MSP1(19) antibodies may be associated with protection.
