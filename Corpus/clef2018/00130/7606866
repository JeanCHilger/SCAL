Serum concentrations of MIP-1 alpha and interleukin-8 in patients suffering from acute Plasmodium falciparum malaria. The chemokines are a superfamily of small proteins secreted primarily by leukocytes and related by a conserved four-cystein motif. In the present study we investigated the serum levels of macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha) and interleukin-8 (IL-8). MIP-1 alpha is a neutrophil chemotactic protein important in acute and chronic inflammation. Recent studies demonstrated that MIP-1 alpha may also act as potent inhibitor of hemopoetic stem cell proliferation, which may be important in the development of prolonged anemia in patients suffering from Plasmodium falciparum malaria. IL-8 serum concentrations correlate with severity and outcome of infectious diseases. Moreover, recent reports indicate that IL-8 plays a major role in fatal gram-negative sepsis. It was the aim of this study to investigate the time course of MIP-1 alpha and IL-8 concentrations in patients suffering from acute P. falciparum infection. Blood samples of 20 patients suffering from severe P. falciparum malaria were investigated. MIP-1 alpha and IL-8 concentrations were determined using ELISA technique at admission, on Days 7, 14, 21, and 28. Maximal concentrations of MIP-1 alpha and IL-8 were found on Day 14, at a time when parasites were not detected in the smears. The serum levels of IL-8 on the day of admission were correlated to the parasite count. No correlation was seen between the hematokrit values and the MIP-1 alpha concentrations at any time.
