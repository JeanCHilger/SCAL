Comparison of the number of IL-4 and IFN-gamma secreting cells in response to the malaria vaccine candidate antigen Pf155/RESA in two groups of naturally primed individuals living in a malaria endemic area in Burkina Faso. The enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay was used to enumerate the number of IFN-gamma and IL-4 producing cells after in vitro stimulation with a highly purified recombinant malaria vaccine candidate antigen (r-Pf155/RESA) or synthetic peptides corresponding to its major T-cell epitopes. Two groups of naturally primed individuals living in rural areas of Burkina Faso were studied. The donors comprised one group of healthy (non-parasitemic) mainly adult people and one parasitemic mainly younger people. IL-4 producing cells were detected in response to PHA but no such cells were detected in response to the malarial antigens. The most frequent IFN-gamma responses were seen with r-Pf155/RESA. Thus, after stimulation with this antigen 52% of the donors responded positively in the ELISPOT assay, while only 17% responded to the synthetic peptides, suggesting that the rPf155/RESA contained T-cell epitopes not covered by the peptides used in this study. The number of IFN-gamma producing cells in response to the malarial antigens did not differ between the two groups. However, IFN-gamma levels found in sera from the parasitemic individuals were significantly higher than in those from healthy donors. This latter finding and the lack of differences seen in the number of IFN-gamma producing spots in the two groups indicate that IFN-gamma producing cells may have sequestered to other organs in the parasitemic group.
