Comparison of serological tests and bio-assay for malaria transmission blocking capacity in field sera. Competition ELISAs have been developed for natural transmission blocking antibodies. Approximately 50% of the sera blocking in the conventional mosquito feeding experiments, gave positive results in these competition ELISAs. Attempts to adapt competition ELISAs to a field application have been partly successful.
