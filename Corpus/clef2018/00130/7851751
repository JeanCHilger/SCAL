Enhanced expression of Plasmodium falciparum heat shock protein PFHSP70-I at higher temperatures and parasite survival. The effect of various body temperatures, encountered during malaria fever, on the synthesis of Plasmodium falciparum heat-shock protein called PFHSP70-I and parasite growth rates among five different isolates are described. The results show that after the exposure of parasites at 39 degrees C for 30 min the amount of PFHSP70-I in all five isolates increased markedly and significantly, whereas parasite growth rates and the amount of total blood stage antigens remained almost unaffected. This indicates that the PFHSP70-I gene responds to heat-shock by producing higher amounts of PFHSP70-I protein, presumably to protect the parasite from being killed during malaria fever.
