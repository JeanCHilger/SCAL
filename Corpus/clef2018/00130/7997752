Malaria serology: performance of six Plasmodium falciparum antigen extracts and of three ways of determining serum titers in IgG and IgM-ELISA. The study evaluated six Plasmodium falciparum antigen extracts to be used in the IgG and IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), for malaria diagnosis and epidemiological studies. Results obtained with eighteen positive and nine negative control sera indicated that there were statistically significant differences among these antigen extracts (Multifactor ANOVA, p < 0.0001). Urea, sodium deoxycholate and Zwittergent antigen extracts performed better than did the three others, their features being very similar for the detection of IgG antibodies. Urea, alkaline and sodium deoxycholate antigen extracts proved to be better than the others for the detection of IgM antibodies. A straight line relationship was found between the optical densities (or their respective log10) and the log10 of antibody dilutions, with a very constant slope. Thus serum titers could be determined by direct titration and by two different equations, needing only one serum dilution. For IgM antibody detections, log10 expression gave results that better correlated with direct titration (95% Bonferroni). For IgG antibody detections, the titer differences were not significant. The reproducibility of antibody titers and antigen batches was also evaluated, giving satisfactory results.
