Comparison of intramuscular and intravenous quinine for the treatment of severe and complicated malaria in children. To compare the efficacy and side effects of intramuscular (i.m.) and intravenous (i.v.) quinine, children in Mozambique with severe and complicated malaria between 6 months and 7 years were randomized to treatment with i.m. or i.v. quinine, both in a dosage of quinine dihydrochloride 20 mg/kg followed by 10 mg/kg every 8 h. Of 57 children treated with i.m. quinine, 4 died, 3 had neurological sequelae and 2 had sterile intramuscular abscesses. Of 47 children treated with i.v. quinine, 6 died and 1 had neurological sequelae. The mean parasite clearance time was 58.6 h in the i.m. group and 59.3 h in the i.v. group. Mean temperature clearance times were 56.1 and 51.8 h, and mean coma clearance times 40.4 and 38.7 h, respectively. None of these differences was statistically significant. Mean trough and peak concentrations of quinine were almost identical in the 2 groups, ranging from 10.5 to 12.6 mg/L, which is in the therapeutic non-toxic range. It is concluded that i.m. quinine is as effective as quinine by i.v. infusion in children with severe and complicated malaria that minor local side effects can probably be avoided by using diluted quinine for i.m. injection
