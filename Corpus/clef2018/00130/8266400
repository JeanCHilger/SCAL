Case studies from the biomedical and health systems research activities of the Swiss Tropical Institute in Africa. Neither high theoretical efficacy of disease control tools, nor diagnostic accuracy, nor good compliance, nor adequate coverage can lead on its own to the final goal of community effectiveness. There is a complex relationship between these factors. The different steps in the process leading to effective health care in the community are discussed on the basis of biomedical and health systems research activities of the Swiss Tropical Institute. Schistosomiasis and malaria control provide the background to problems related to the efficacy of tools. In particular, information on the trial of a malaria vaccine candidate (SPf66) is given. Approaches to the rapid, accurate and economical diagnosis of communities at risk are discussed with reference to Schistosoma haematobium and S. mansoni. Health service support projects in Tanzania and Chad are presented to exemplify problems linked to the compliance of users/providers and coverage. Finally, it is shown that community effectiveness depends on the highest possible success rate for each step. This requires the co-operative efforts of all those involved: the scientist, the manager, the community health worker and, last but not least, the community itself.
