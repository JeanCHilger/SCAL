Plasmodium falciparum: analysis of the cytoadherence inhibition of the human monoclonal antibody 33G2 and of antibodies reactive with antigen Pf332. The capacity of a human monoclonal antibody (MAb 33G2) to interfere in vitro both with Plasmodium falciparum merozoite invasion and cytoadherence of infected erythrocytes to melanoma cells has been reported. MAb 33G2 cross-reacts with several P. falciparum antigens but shows highest reactivity with repeated sequences in the asexual blood stage antigen Pf332. This study was conducted in order to further analyze the cytoadherence inhibition mediated by MAb 33G2 and to evaluate the relative contribution of antibodies to Pf332 in the inhibitory activity of immunoglobulins from P. falciparum immune donors. We show here that MAb 33G2 inhibits cytoadherence of infected erythrocytes (PRBCs) with similar efficiency independently of the strain of parasite, while the inhibitory capacity of immunoglobulin fractions from Liberian immune donors was restricted to some strains only. There appears to be no correlation between the reactivity with Pf332 of immunoglobulin preparations from different donors and their capacity to inhibit cytoadherence of PRBCs to melanoma cells. In contrast to MAb 33G2, polyclonal antibodies affinity purified on the Pf332 peptide containing the epitope seen by the MAb showed little or no inhibition of cytoadherence of infected erythrocytes.
