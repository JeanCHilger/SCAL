Long-term persistence of sterile immunity in a volunteer immunized with X-irradiated Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites. Three volunteers were immunized by repeated exposure to the bites of Plasmodium falciparum-infected, X-irradiated mosquitoes to characterize immunologic responses and duration of protective immunity. A primary series of immunizations had been shown previously to induce sterile immunity in these volunteers against sporozoite-induced P. falciparum malaria. In the current study, antibodies to sporozoites circulated at high levels for at least 9-12 months after the volunteers were administered booster bites from X-irradiated infective mosquitoes. One volunteer challenged a second time with P. falciparum 9 months after his last immunization was again shown to be protected, whereas all 5 control subjects developed patent infections. These results set a new standard for persistence of sterile immunity against experimental P. falciparum infection.
