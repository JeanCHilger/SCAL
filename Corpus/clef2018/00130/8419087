Quantification of antibody-secreting lymphocytes that react with Pf155/RESA from Plasmodium falciparum: an ELISPOT assay for field studies. We have adapted the enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT) to enumerate the cells from Plasmodium falciparum-primed donors that produce IgG in vitro in response to malaria antigens. In vitro activation of cell cultures with two synthetic peptides (EENVEHDA)4, and (LGRSGGDIIKMQTL) corresponding to immunodominant T cell epitopes of the ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen (Pf155/RESA) gave specific antibody-secreting cells (ASC) in five and six of the 15 P. falciparum-primed donors from Cameroon. Antibodies produced after a stimulation by synthetic peptides reacted also with total parasite proteins. However, crude P. falciparum antigen did not trigger a higher number of cells than did synthetic peptides. The absence of significant relation between the presence of sera antibodies and in vitro ASC against the same peptide suggests that the kinetics of circulating primed lymphocytes and antibodies are different. We evaluated 0.04-0.29% of peripheral blood B cells to be the frequency of memory cells specific to a single Pf155/RESA epitope in these donors. This study suggests that the ELISPOT assay should permit the analysis of B cell responses to malarial antigens at the single-cell level and its applicability to epidemiological field studies. This assay should be well suited to the identification of T helper epitopes capable of inducing the production of antibodies by human B cells, and will constitute an important tool for the selection of immunogens to be included in a subunit vaccine.
