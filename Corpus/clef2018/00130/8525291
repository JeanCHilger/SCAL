The antimalarial drug, Ro 42-1611 (arteflene), does not affect cytoadherence and cytokine-inducing properties of Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites. The purpose of this study was to investigate the ability of the antimalarial drug, Ro 42-1611 to block parasite mediated cytokine induction in vitro as well as cytoadherence of infected erythrocytes to melanoma cells in vitro. The biological activity of Ro 42-1611 was confirmed as it blocked Plasmodium falciparum growth in cultures. Ro 42-1611, had no major effect on TNF, IL-alpha or IL-6 cytokine release from mononuclear cells stimulated with malaria antigens or lipopolysaccharide and it did not affect cell viability. Ro 42-1611 only slightly suppressed cytoadherence of infected erythrocytes to melanoma cells. The therapeutic effect of To 42-1611 appears to be confined to its parasite killing activity.
