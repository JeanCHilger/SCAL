Humoral immune responses to the Plasmodium falciparum antigen Pf155 RESA in adults with differential clinical conditions from an Indian zone where malaria is endemic. Ring infected erythrocyte surface antigen of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf155/RESA) has been considered as a vaccine candidate. However, the relative immunogenicity of this antigen has not been studied in Indian populations. Pf155/RESA was investigated for its immunogenicity by studying humoral immune responses against Pf155/RESA and Pf155/RESA derived peptides (P1, P2 representing immunodominant epitopes from the 3' and P3 from the 5' repeat regions) by erythrocyte membrane immunofluorescence (EMIF) assay and by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in P. falciparum primed donors living in hyperendemic malarious areas (Orissa State, India) where P. falciparum infections are highly prevalent. Subjects of different clinical status namely acute (A), clinically immune (CI) and acute with history of repeated P. falciparum infections (R) were included in this study. All the donors were seropositive against the crude antigen. There was considerable variation in the responses among the donors. While humoral responses in the plasmas against the P2 peptide (EENV)4 were significantly higher in magnitude and in frequency in the CI donors than in the A donors, no positive response was seen in the R donors. The responses to the peptides P1 (EENVEHDA)2 and P3 (DDEHVEEPTVA)2 were poor both in the A and in the CI groups. Whereas, most of the R donors were seropositive against the P3. The present results indicate that Pf155/RESA contains B cell epitopes which were recognized differently by the immune system of individuals living in malaria-hyperendemic areas of India who have been primed by natural infection. Our studies also suggest that in order to investigate the possible functional role of a given antigen, study of immune responses against the antigen in donors of different clinical status may be useful.
