The utilization of molecular biological tools in the study of malaria transmission: example of programs conducted in Senegal. Some informations about malaria transmission, which has until nox difficult to get, can be obtained thanks to the use of molecular biology tools, PCR mainly. In Senegal, we use that technique to solve two kinds of problems: -Identification of species of the Anopheles gambiae complex: PCR technique is useful compared to other diagnostic methods (chromosome pattern, DNA probes, etc.) because it enables quickly and simply identification of captured anopheles from the DNA contained in their legs. The rest of the mosquito is tested by circumsporozoite protein antigen ELISA and blood meal ELISA. The data obtained are used to determine distribution, cycles, trophic preferences and comparative vectorial capacities of Anopheles gambiae, Anopheles arabiensis and Anopheles melas. -Identification in a mosquito blood meal of the individual bitten: we propose to evaluate factors (weight, age, sex, location of bedroom, etc.) which could explain why individuals are more, or less, bitten by a Plasmodium vector. Genetic typing is used on inhabitants'leukocytes DNA and on the leukocyte DNA extracted from the blood meal of resting anopheles. Through the high degree of polymorphism of three (AAAG)n microsatellites markers, we hope, using PCR, to attribute each blood meal to one individual. Statistical analysis will be used to identify attractivity factors and to determine more precisely the inoculation rates for each group rather than the classical rate calculated with male adults volunteers.
