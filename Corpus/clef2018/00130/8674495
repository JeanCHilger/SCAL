Determination of the human blood index of some anopheline mosquitos by using ELISA. To determine the human blood index, 1253 anopheline mosquitos collected from Arbaminch, Awassa, Metahara and Ziway were tested by the blood meal ELISA, based on anti-human IgG. Higher positivity for human blood were observed in anopheline mosquitos collected from mixed dwellings (range, 26-92%) while those from animal shelters had the lowest positivity (range, 9-48%). The human blood index for A. arabiensis, a principal malaria vector in most parts of the country, from mixed dwelling collections was 88% while it was 43% for those collected from animal shelters. For A. pharoensis, it was 84% and 9%, and for A. coustani, it was 26% and 15% for the respective sites of collection. The human blood index of A. marshalli was 40% for A. demeilloni, it was 36%
