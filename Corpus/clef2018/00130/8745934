Detection of anti-Plasmodium falciparum antibodies directed against a repetitive peptide of the gametocyte antigen Pfs2400 in malaria patients in Brazil. Sera collected from 164 individuals who had clinical Plasmodium falciparum malaria and came from several areas of Brazil where malaria is endemic were tested for the presence of anti-gametocyte antibodies. Antibodies directed against P. falciparum gametocytes were detected, by IFAT, in the sera of 67.1% of these patients. The prevalence of these antibodies was significantly higher in patients who had undergone multiple attacks of malaria than in those who were experiencing their first attack at the time of serum collection. Although circulating gametocytes were detected in 22% of the patients at this time, there was no difference in the percentages of IFAT positivity between apparent gametocyte 'carriers' and 'non-carriers'. All sera were also tested by ELISA, using a dimer of the nonamer peptide [PEE(L/V)VEEV(I/V)]2, which represents a tandem consensus repeat of the P. falciparum gametocyte antigen, Pfs2400, a target of transmission-blocking antibodies. ELISA demonstrated that 32.9% of the patients had antibodies that reacted with this peptide. Positive ELISA reactions were significantly more frequent amongst the sera of patients who had had multiple malaria attacks than in those undergoing their first malaria episode positivity was lower in the gametocyte 'carriers' than in their 'non-carriers'. These results demonstrate that anti-gametocyte antibodies, which have already been shown to have potential transmission-blocking activity, are naturally elicited in Brazilian patients, the highest rates of seropositivity occurring after multiple malaria attacks.
