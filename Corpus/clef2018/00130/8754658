Parasitic infections presenting as prolonged fevers. Over two successive years, out of 187 cases of fevers of undetermined origin (FUO) admitted to Abbassia and Embaba Fever Hospitals, 30 (16%) cases proved to be of parasitic origin. Ten within normal subjects were taken as controls. Complete blood picture, repeated stool examination, rectal snip by transparency technique, ELISA for specific IgM antibodies for S. mansoni, indirect haemagglutination test for S. mansoni, Fasciola, hydatid, amoebic liver abscess and toxoplasmosis, indirect fluorescent antibody test for toxoplasmosis and abdominal ultrasonography were performed whenever indicated. Cases comprised 8 (26%) acute S. mansoni, 7 (24%) acute fascioliasis, 3 (10%) hydatid cyst, 8 (26%) amoebic liver abscess, 2 (7%) toxoplasmoisis and 2 (7%) malaria cases. The clinical picture of acute S. mansoni and acute fascioliasis were similar in the form of prolonged fever, diarrhea, hepatomegaly and leucocytosis with high eosinophilia. Serology (ELISA and IHAT) was essential in differentiating them. Abdominal ultrasonography is an easy, sensitive, cheap, non-invasive technique aiding in the diagnosis of amoebic liver abscess, liver hydatid cysts and fascioliasis but again serology was essential in differenting them. Toxoplasmic lymphadenitis mimic the clinical picture of infectious mononucleosis. Serology (monospot test, IHAT, IFAT) clinched the diagnosis. Malaria cases presented atypically by gastrointestinal manifestations and hepatic affection. Diagnosis was by positive blood smears.
