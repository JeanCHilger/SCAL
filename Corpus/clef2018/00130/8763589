Diagnostic and prognostic importance of laboratory tests in malaria in airports. Study of six recent cases. During the summer 1994, six cases of airport malaria occurred in France, near the Roissy-Charles-de-Gaulle airport. Due to Plasmodium falciparum, all cases underwent rapid and severe deterioration, and in one case, the patient died. The role of laboratory tests is essential to establish the diagnosis of persons who have never resided in the endemic malaria areas and follow up with the patients already under treatment to detect possible complications.
