ParaSight-F test to diagnose malaria in hypo-endemic and epidemic prone regions of Vietnam. The antigen capture ParaSight-F test was evaluated during a drug sensitivity survey in a hypoendemic region of northern Vietnam. When only asexual blood forms of P. falciparum were considered, sensitivity of ParaSight-F was 100%, specificity 88% (95% CI 95-80%), positive predictive value 68% (95% CI 85-50%) and negative predictive value 100%. ParaSight-F proved very convenient for rapid screening and selection of patients to enrol in a drug sensitivity study. In northern Vietnam, the introduction of the test as a routine diagnostic tool is not justified, considering its high cost, the necessity to carry out the treatment of presumptive Plasmodium vivax cases and the persistence of positive reactions following treatment. However, the test will be a valuable tool in remote areas in emergency situations, where rapid confirmation of a P. falciparum outbreak is required.
