Application of peptide ELISA in tribal malaria of Madhya Pradesh. A recently developed peptide ELISA method was used for monitoring the efficacy of malaria control programme in the tribal areas of Madhya Pradesh. Both crude Pf antigen and synthetic nonapeptide were used in ELISA for seroepidemiological studies. Both antigen responded equally well but the synthetic peptide had advantages of purity, defined characteristic and easy availability. Population of Mandla protected by vector control measures showed lower antibody titre and lower percentage positivity compared to the unprotected population of Jabalpur. A 0-5 yrs sentinel population from Haldwani almost seronegative has been taken as control.
