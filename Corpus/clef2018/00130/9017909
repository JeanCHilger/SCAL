Glutamate dehydrogenase antigen detection in Plasmodium falciparum infections. The usefulness of malaria diagnosis by Plasmodium falciparum GDH (NADP+), obtained by affinity chromatography, is demonstrated in ELISA assays, testing IgG antibodies against GDH (NADP+) from patients with acute malaria, who have had two or more episodes of malaria, or from sera of hyperimmune patients. GDH (NADP+) thermal stability was demonstrated in a high heat resistance assay. The immunofluorescence assay demonstrated that anti-culture (P. falciparum) supernatant serum and anti-GDH (NADP+) of Proteus spp. recognized epitopes in Venezuelan isolates, and Colombian and Brasilian malarial strains. The antigen is soluble, with high specificity, is a potent immunogen and is thermoresistant.
