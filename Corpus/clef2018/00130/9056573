Malaria. The preeminent infectious threat to unwary tropical travelers, malaria is a preventable, mosquito-borne protozoan infection of red blood cells, which causes fever, anemia, respiratory failure, coma, and death. Malaria is a true medical emergency that requires rapid diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, in two thirds of tropical travelers who die of malaria, either treatment is delayed or the diagnosis is simply missed. Every tropical traveler with fever or unexplained, flu-like illness must be assumed to have life-threatening malaria and must have thick and thin blood smears immediately examined to confirm the diagnosis.
