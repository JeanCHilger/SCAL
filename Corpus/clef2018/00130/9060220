Field evaluation of the QBC technique for rapid diagnosis of vivax malaria. The QBC (quantitative buffy coat) technique was compared with that of the Giemsa-stained thick blood film (GTF) under field conditions in Junlian and Mingshan counties, Sichuan, China, for rapid diagnosis of vivax malaria. Blood samples were collected from 364 volunteer villagers, and each sample was examined with both the QBC and GTF techniques. For each GTF sample (10 microliters of blood), as many as 300 oil-immersion fields were examined each QBC tube was inspected for up to 5 minutes. The GTF technique resulted in 86 positive blood samples and 278 negative
