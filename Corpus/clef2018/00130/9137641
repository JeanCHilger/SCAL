Antibody responses to Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite-, liver- and blood-stage synthetic peptides in migrant and autochthonous populations in malaria endemic areas. This study evaluates the differences in host immune responses to defined plasmodial antigens in four geographically different regions in which malaria is endemic. Sera from 527 individuals were tested for the presence of antibodies specific for three types of plasmodial antigen: liver-stage antigen (LSA-1), blood-stage antigen (SPF 70) and circumsporozoite (CS) antigen (NANP)4. The individuals taking part in the study comprised: patients with transfusional malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum or P. vivax non-immune migrants residing in an endemic area in Rond√¥nia
