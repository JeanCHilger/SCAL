Temporal association between serum gelsolin levels and clinical events in a patient with severe falciparum malaria. Actin is present in high concentrations in most eukaryotic cells and can polymerize into filaments under physiological buffer conditions. As a result of tissue injury and cell lysis, large quantities of actin are released locally and may obstruct the downstream microvasculature, causing further damage to already injured organs. It has been postulated that this mechanism contributes to the development of the adult respiratory distress syndrome and to the diverse complications of falciparum malaria. Actin scavenging proteins--e.g., gelsolin--counteract the effects of extracellular actin, but the capacity of these plasma proteins can be overwhelmed by massive tissue injury. We examined the temporal relationship between serum levels of gelsolin (and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) and the clinical findings for a patient with severe falciparum malaria. The level of gelsolin decreased and then increased as the patient's status first worsened and then improved. We could not determine whether gelsolin served a biologically important function in this patient's recovery or was simply an epiphenomenon of disease activity. Gelsolin levels may be an early prognostic indicator in patients with a systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Moreover, the potential therapeutic role of recombinant human plasma gelsolin in patients with delayed organ dysfunction that commonly follows a self-limited initial insult merits investigation.
