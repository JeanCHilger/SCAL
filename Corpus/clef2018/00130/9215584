A simple Trypanosoma cruzi enzyme-linked immunoassay for control of human infection in nonendemic areas. An enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for detecting IgM and IgG antibodies against Trypanosoma cruzi in blood bank donors from endemic or nonendemic areas. A crude extract of trypomastigotes from cultures was used as antigen. A total of 494 serum samples from patients with acute, congenital, or chronic form of Chagas' disease, and from healthy French individuals were studied. The sensitivity of the ELISA was determined with 89 serum samples from chagasic patients and was evaluated to 98.8%. The specificity was determined with 405 serum samples from French blood transfusion centers donors and evaluated to 98.3%. Two hundred and eighty-five serum samples from blood donors from Argentina and Brazil were also tested. Furthermore, in order to assess the absence of cross-reactivity with other protozoan infections, we studied 86 serum samples including (i) 32 individuals with cutaneous leishmaniasis living in a T. cruzi endemic region of Bolivia, and (ii) 54 patients from nonendemic area for Chagas' disease, 19 of them with kala-azar and 35 others with malaria.
