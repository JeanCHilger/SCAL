Assessing the economic impact of a rapid on-site malaria diagnostic test. A set of three models has been developed for assessing the economic impact of existing and new malaria diagnostic technology, specifically microscopy of blood slides and rapid on-site diagnostic tests (RDT). The models allow for phased introduction of the new technology in targeted areas. The derived computer software program facilitates evaluation of costs to the supplier, to the consumer and aggregate costs, with comparison among the three models to give relative costs of progressive transition from blood slides to RDT technology. The models and the related software program can assist planners in the health sector in determining costs of current programs and assessing the potential economic impact of introducing rapid on-site diagnosis. Details of the models and the operational software program are available on request.
