Semi-quantitative measurement of Plasmodium falciparum antigen PfHRP2 in blood and plasma. Plasmodium falciparum histidine rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) antigen was measured semi-quantitatively in whole blood, plasma, and supernatants and red blood cells of cultures in vitro using the dipstick ParaSight-F test and also by a quantitative antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In vitro, PfHRP2 was secreted mainly during the second half of the asexual cycle with a marked rise during schizont development and rupture. The total PfHRP2 secreted before schizogony corresponded to approximately 4% of that contained in the red blood cells. In samples from 55 patients with acute falciparum malaria, the level of detection by ELISA corresponded to parasitaemias of 100/microL for whole blood and 1600/microL for separated plasma. Whole blood PfHRP2 levels were correlated significantly with admission parasitaemia (r = 0.76, P < 0.0001) and the stage of parasite development (r = 0.43, P < 0.01). Although whole blood PfHRP2 concentrations were higher in severe malaria, plasma concentrations of PfHRP2 were considerably higher in severe malaria (median titre 1:320, range zero to 1:1280) than in uncomplicated malaria (median titre 1:5, range zero to 1:80 P < 0.0001). The ratio of whole blood to plasma PfHRP2 was lower in severe than in uncomplicated malaria (median 4, range 0.25 to 256, versus 64, range 4 to 1280
