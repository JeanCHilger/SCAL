Comparative performance of the ParaSight F test for detection of Plasmodium falciparum in malaria-immune and nonimmune populations in Irian Jaya, Indonesia. A comparison was made of the performance of the ParaSight F test (F test) for detection of Plasmodium falciparum in blood from malaria-immune (410 native Irianese) and nonimmune (369 new transmigrants) populations in Irian Jaya, Indonesia, where malaria is hyperendemic and all four species of human malaria occur. There were highly significant differences between populations in the sensitivity (Irianese, 60% versus transmigrants, 84% P < 0.001) and specificity (Irianese, 97% versus transmigrants, 84%The ParaSight F test uses a nonmicroscopic dipstick approach to the rapid detection of Plasmodium falciparum in blood.  The performance of this test was assessed in serum samples collected in Irian Jaya, Indonesia, from 410 native Irianese (malaria-immune) and 369 new transmigrants (nonimmune).  Of particular interest was the capability of the F test to detect P. falciparum prevalence among children, whose immunity is less than that of adults.  There were highly significant differences by population in the F test's sensitivity (60% for Irianese vs. 84% for transmigrants) and specificity (97% for Irianese vs. 84% for transmigrants).  The test had high sensitivity levels (76-85%) for Irianese children 10 years of age and under and both child and adult transmigrants, but low sensitivity (40%) for Irianese over 10 years of age.  Specificity was comparably high (93-98%) for transmigrant children and both age groups of Irianese.  The low specificity (79%) for transmigrants over 10 years of age reflected a preponderance of false positives, frequently identified by microscopy as P. vivax.  These findings suggest that microscopy comparisons underestimate the performance of the ParaSight F test and that malaria immune status, regardless of P. falciparum density, may influence the test's sensitivity.
