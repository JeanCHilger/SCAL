Detection of circulating antigens of Parastrongylus cantonensis in human sera by dot-blot ELISA and sandwich ELISA using monoclonal antibody. A dot-blot ELISA was compared with a previously performed sandwich ELISA for the detection of Parastrongylus cantonensis antigens in sera from patients. Using the same monoclonal antibody and the same sera, 6 of 10 sera (60%) from parastronglyiasis patients were positive in dot-blot ELISA, whereas with sandwich ELISA, 5 of the same patient sera (50%) were positive. The specificity in both assays was 100% using 50 sera from patients with other parasitic diseases of these, 10 each were from patients with cysticercosis, filariasis, gnathostomiasis, malaria and toxocariasis. The control group consisted of 53 sera from normal health Thais and Malaysians. The sensitivity of the assays was, however, slightly better with dot-blot ELISA and because it is simple, quick and cost-effective, it may be a test of choice for specific diagnosis of human parastrongyliasis.
