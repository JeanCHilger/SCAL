A rapid immunochromatographic test (ICT) for diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum. A field study was conducted to assess the sensitivity and specificity of rapid immunodiagnostic test based on detection of Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein-2 (PfHRP-2) in peripheral blood for diagnosis of P. falciparum infection. Evaluation in 173 patients showed that the assay was 98.59% sensitive and 97.1% specific. There was no cross-reactivity with P. vivax. The test was positive in few patients who were found to be negative by microscopy showing the presence of antigen after curative chemotherapy. The test is a valuable diagnostic tool for falciparum malaria, especially in emergency/field situations requiring rapid diagnosis.
