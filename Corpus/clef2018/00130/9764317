Correlation between positive serology for Plasmodium vivax-like/Plasmodium simiovale malaria parasites in the human and anopheline populations in the State of Acre, Brazil. Antibodies against the Plasmodium vivax-like/P. simiovale malaria parasite circumsporozoite repeat peptide (APGANQEGGAA)3 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 120 sera randomly collected in 1994 from adults in 3 localities of the malaria endemic area in the State of Acre, Brazil antibody was detected in 18 (15%). A 'sandwich' ELISA using monoclonal antibody (mab) Pam 172, directed against the same peptide, was carried out on 1207 Anopheles oswaldoi, 12 of which (1.0%) were positive, and 168 A. deaneorum, 2 of which (1.2%) were positive. This is the first report of serological detection of the P. vivax-like parasite in anophelines and the first report linking anopheline to human serology for this parasite in the same geographical area. It is an additional indication that A. oswaldoi is a malaria vector in Acre.
