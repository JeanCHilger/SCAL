Malaria diagnosis by dipstick assay in a Honduran population with coendemic Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. A Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase dipstick designed to separately detect P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria was evaluated in two Honduran populations where both species are endemic. The dipstick was compared to thick film microscopy the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to analyze discordant results. The dipstick had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 95% compared with microscopy in the diagnosis of Plasmodium infections in a hospital population
