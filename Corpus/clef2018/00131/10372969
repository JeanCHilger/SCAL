Identification of antibodies directed against O-acetylated sialic acids in visceral leishmaniasis: its diagnostic and prognostic role. A significantly increased O-acetylated sialic acid (O-AcSA) binding fraction was purified from serum of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) patients by affinity chromatography on immobilized bovine submaxillary mucin (BSM) and found to be immunoglobulin in origin. The serodiagnostic and prognostic potential of BSM as a capture antigen was established by ELISA with no cross reactivity with coendemic diseases like malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy, chagas disease and cutaneous leishmaniasis however, a strong cross reactivity was present with trypanosomiasis patients. In 56 clinically diagnosed VL patients, the BSM-ELISA was compared with diagnosis by microscopy using Giemsa stained tissue smears and direct ELISA using crude parasite antigen (parasite-ELISA)
