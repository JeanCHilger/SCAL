Cystic lesions of the pancreas. Most cystic lesions of the pancreas are pseudocysts caused by acute or chronic pancreatitis. Congenital cysts are rare and may occur in congenital syndromes like von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. Cystic tumors of the pancreas may be difficult to distinguish clinically however, because of their malignant potential, in particular in cases of mucinous types, diagnostic verification is crucial. Hence, in all cases of cystic lesions of the pancreas, which are not a sequela of an etiological confirmed acute or chronic pancreatitis, a cystic neoplasm must be ruled out. Differential diagnosis may be difficult even with ultrasonography, computertomography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and serum analysesThe most important differential diagnosis in all cystic lesions of the pancreas with atypical presentation includes a cystic neoplasm. Therefore complete resection is indicated whenever the suspicion cannot be ruled out.
