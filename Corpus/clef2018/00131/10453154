Haemosuccus pancreaticus due to mucinous cystadenocarcinoma: the significance of recurrent abdominal pain, hyperamylasaemia and a pancreatic cyst in association with recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding. Haemosuccus pancreaticus is a rare cause of gastrointestinal haemorrhage, and when it presents in otherwise healthy people, can prove difficult to diagnose. The cardinal features are episodic epigastric pain associated with a raised serum amylase and the passage of melaena. Failure to make the connection between recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding and apparently unrelated symptoms attributable to pancreatitis may lead to a significant delay in diagnosis.
