Flow cytometric analysis of IgG reactive to parasitized red blood cell membrane antigens in Plasmodium falciparum-immune individuals. Antigens exposed at the surface of Plasmodium falciparum parasitized red blood cells (pRBCs) represent potential targets for protective antibodies involved in opsonization and immune phagocytosis of pRBCs. We measured the recognition of parasitized red blood cell membrane associated antigens by IgG in the plasma of clinically immune individuals by flow cytometry and ELISA. The plasmas were selected on the basis of preexisting IgG antibodies to pRBC membrane associated recombinant proteins. In every plasma sample IgG could bind the surface of live pRBCs in flow cytometry. In addition, there was a significant correlation between the level of IgG recognition of live pRBCs and of pRBC membrane ghost proteins or major identified antigens by ELISA. Flow cytometry thus represents a technique suitable to test for the accessibility and potential functionality of IgG antibodies directed to antigens expressed by the surface of pRBCs.
