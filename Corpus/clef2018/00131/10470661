Metachronous bile duct cancer in a patient surviving for a decade and undergoing curative surgery twice. We report a 75-year-old woman with metachronous bile duct cancer who underwent curative resection twice and has survived for a decade. In 1989, she was admitted because her serum alkaline phosphatase level was elevated. Computed tomography (CT) showed a low-density mass, 2 cm in diameter, at the left hepatic duct and intrahepatic bile duct dilatation in the left lobe. We diagnosed the lesion as an intrahepatic bile duct cancer and performed extended left hepatic lobectomy with systematic lymph node dissection. The histological diagnosis was a well differentiated cholangiocellular carcinoma with hepatic hilar and celiac lymph node metastases (T1N2M0, Stage IVB). In 1996, she was re-admitted with obstructive jaundice. CT showed a slightly enhanced mass, 4 cm in diameter, in the pancreatic head. After reducing the jaundice by percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage, pancreatoduodenectomy was performed. The histological diagnosis of this lesion was a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma originating from the intrapancreatic bile duct. Ten years after the first operation, she is leading a normal daily life with no cancer recurrence. These findings suggest that repeated curative surgery can result in a long-term survival of patients with metachronous bile duct cancer.
