Serodiagnosis of leishmaniasis with recombinant ORFF antigen. The serodiagnostic potential of recombinant ORFF protein (rORFF) from Leishmania infantum was assessed by ELISA. Of 49 sera from confirmed cases of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), all were seropositive using 5 ng of rORFF and serum diluted 1:20, while only 38 were positive with 500 ng of soluble antigen (SA) and 44 were positive by a direct agglutination test. There was also a positive correlation between spleen size and level of seropositivity with rORFF or SA. The reciprocal endpoint titer with rORFF was 1,280 for sera from VL patients, but < 20 with sera from malaria, filariasis, and tuberculosis patients, as well as with sera from healthy individuals from endemic and non-endemic areas. Sera from 10 confirmed cutaneous leishmaniasis cases from Turkey were negative or only weakly positive with rORFF although 9 were positive with SA. Thus, rORFF protein appears useful as a sensitive reagent for the differential diagnosis of VL caused by the Leishmania donovani complex.
