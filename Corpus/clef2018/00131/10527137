MR cholangiopancreatography in malignant biliary obstruction. Malignant lesions of the biliary tract are a frequent occurrence, typically presenting with clinical findings of obstructive jaundice. The authors discuss the role of MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) as a second level diagnostic technique, which can provide information regarding not only the location, but also the cause of the obstruction. This can be obtained if MRCP is considered as part of a complete study of the upper abdomen, with acquisition of T1- and T2-weighted images. The "all-in-one" approach may provide the identification, characterization, and staging of the lesion, giving the clinician all the information necessary for the planning of adequate treatment. Typical MR features of cholangiocarcinoma are provided, as well as conventional MR and MRCP findings in pancreatic carcinoma, periampullary carcinoma, and biliary obstruction secondary to hilar lymphadenopathy and metastatic lesions.
