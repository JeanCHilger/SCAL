Secretin-enhanced MR pancreatography. MR cholangiopancreatography has now emerged as a noninvasive diagnostic technique that can replace diagnostic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in many instances. Recent technical issues include the use of fast single-shot T2-weighted single-slice projections in combination with a negative oral contrast agent and secretin stimulation for assessment of pancreatic flow dynamics and duodenal filling. Potential clinical applications include the evaluation of patients with recurrent pancreatitis and inconclusive CT examination as well as the evaluation of chronic pancreatitis complications whenever endoscopic treatment is suggested. In combination with cross-sectional MR sequences, secretin-enhanced MR pancreatography offers the possibility of a comprehensive examination of the pancreas that provides parenchymal, ductal, and functional information within a single diagnostic modality.
