Analysis of Plasmodium falciparum infections in a village community in Northern Nigeria: determination of msp2 genotypes and parasite-specific IgG responses. The genetic diversity of P. falciparum and multiplicity of infection has been studied in a village in Northern Nigeria at the end of the rainy season, when transmission is high. We analysed blood samples from 104 individuals aged 5-70 years by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifying the gene for the merozoite surface protein MSP2 followed by genotyping based on restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). 94.2% of all samples were parasite positive by PCR and over 80% of those had multiple infections. The age distribution of the average number of parasite clones present in P. falciparum infections showed an initial increase, then reached a peak multiplicity in children 8-10 years of age, and afterwards decreased significantly with age. Mean multiplicity in those 8-10-year-old children was 5.4 clones per carrier. Peak multiplicity and parasite diversity in Nigerian individuals is compared to findings from other study sites in Africa and PNG. The prevalence of IgG antibodies against the circumsporozoite protein (CSP), an indicator for malaria exposure, was over 85% in all age groups showing a high exposure of villagers to P. falciparum. OD values in ELISA were positively correlated with age. There was no correlation between the level of IgG against CSP and the multiplicity of P. falciparum infections determined by PCR of msp2. These results imply that in highly endemic areas multiplicity of infection is not directly correlated with exposure to P. falciparum.
