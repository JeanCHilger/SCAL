Complicated malaria is associated with differential elevations in serum levels of interleukins 10, 12, and 15. Complicated malaria, caused by Plasmodium falciparum, is characterized by multiple organ dysfunction. The pathogenesis of complicated malaria involves complex host-parasite interactions that include polarized cytokine responses. Recently, correlates between Th1-like and Th2-like cytokines, especially interleukin-10 (IL), IL-12, and TNF-alpha, and specific types of organ dysfunction have been noted. Here, we measured IL-10, IL-12, and for the first time, IL-15, in 19 patients aged 16-55 years old with complicated malaria on days 0 (admission), 3, 7, and 14. For analysis, patients were grouped together or sub-categorized into hyperparasitemias or cerebral malaria (CM). For IL-10, a dramatic increase was noted on admission, followed by a reduction toward control values that closely paralleled parasite clearance. For IL-12, modest but persistent increases were noted over the entire 14 day period that did not correlate with parasitemia. In general, especially on days 0 and 3, hyperparasitemic patients had, in comparison with CM patients, higher IL-10 and IL-12 levels. In contrast, IL-15 was generally below detection in most samples. These results provide further insight into the pathogenesis of complicated malaria by strengthening the contention that cytokines such as IL-10 and IL-12 are involved in modulating the immune response to P. falciparum.
