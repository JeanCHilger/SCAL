Identification of a novel antigenic domain of Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein-1 that specifically binds to human erythrocytes and inhibits parasite invasion, in vitro. Merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1) of Plasmodium falciparum is a promising candidate for vaccine development against malaria. Identification of protective epitopes within MSP-1 is an important step towards the elucidation of mechanisms of parasitic invasion and for the creation of a multi-subunit vaccine. In this study, we show that a 115 amino acid region (p115MSP-1) within the p38 domain of MSP-1 can: (i) specifically bind to human erythrocytes, independent of glycophorin A (ii) inhibit parasite invasion at significant levels, in vitro
