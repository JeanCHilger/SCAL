Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 test results in patients with malaria and dengue infections. Six rapid enzyme immunoassays for the detection of HIV antibody were performed on paired sera from 66 patients with malaria and 9 patients with dengue. Kit specificities ranged from 77% to 100%, demonstrating that more data are needed on cross-reactivity with endemic diseases as the use of rapid HIV tests increases.
