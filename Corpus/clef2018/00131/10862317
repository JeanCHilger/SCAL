Rapid diagnosis of falciparum malaria by detection of Plasmodium falciparum HRP-2 antigen. Malaria is a resurging problem all over the country and rapid diagnosis is mandatory to decrease the morbidity and mortality and for control of malaria. In the current study the aim was to evaluate the usefulness of rapid Plasmodium falciparum antigen detection and to compare its utility over conventional peripheral thick and thin smear examination.Three hundred fifty seven randomly selected patients with pyrexia and or atypical presentations of malaria, found initially negative for malaria were subjected to thick and thin smear examination and Plasmodium falciparum antigen detection test by using commercially available Parasight F. kit.54.6% of cases presented with pyrexia, while other presentations of falciparum malaria were less frequently encountered (162/357). Eighty five patients (23.8%) were diagnosed as having falciparum malaria based on smear/Parasight F. Test. Eighty- four of these patients were positive for Parasight F. test and only 34.51% of these cases were also positive on smear examination.The antigen detection test for Plasmodium falciparum is useful for rapid diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. It could detect 65.5% cases of falciparum malaria which were initially negative by peripheral smear examination. Hence, this technique is superior to peripheral smear staining and helps early diagnosis.
