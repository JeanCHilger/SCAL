The spectrum of mucin-producing adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. The clinical distinction between cystic and mucinous carcinomas of the pancreas has been poorly defined. Therefore we sought to stratify the entity known as pancreatic mucinous adenocarcinoma based on pathologic and clinical criteria. Clinical data and pathology specimens were reviewed for patients (n = 40) who had been diagnosed as having mucin-producing pancreatic adenocarcinoma and had undergone either resection or intraoperative biopsy of their pancreatic tumor during a 40-year period at the UCLA Medical Center. Based on histologic criteria, three distinct classes of pancreatic adenocarcinoma were identified: mucinous noncystic (colloid) adenocarcinoma (group I), mucinous cystadenocarcinoma (group II), and ductal adenocarcinoma (group III). Based on clinical behavior, groups I and III were indistinguishable. Compared to patients from groups I and III, those from group II were younger, more likely to be female, and had a better prognosis. Among mucin-producing adenocarcinomas of the pancreas, mucinous noncystic adenocarcinoma and ductal adenocarcinoma share similar clinical features, whereas true cystic lesions represent a distinct clinical entity.
