Effect of serum dilution in diagnosis of malaria in community. Recently, it has been shown that immunological methods can be used for the diagnosis of malaria other than sero-epidemiology. A study has been done to investigate optimum binding capacity of antigen-antibody (Ag-Ab) at different serum dilutions. For validating antigen-antibody (Ag-Ab) reaction at 1:100, 1:1000 and 1:1000 serum dilutions, have been tested in two different laboratories to establish validation of the ELISA method. Inter laboratory test on synthetic peptide (RI) ELISA was found comparable and meaningful for assessing malaria transmission in defined locality at 1:100 dilution. Results also showed that 1:1000 serum dilution can be useful for diagnostic purpose.
