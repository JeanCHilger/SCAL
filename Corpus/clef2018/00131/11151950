A 33-35 kDa circulating antigen from Plasmodium falciparum. Isolation and characterisation of Plasmodium falciparum (Welch, 1897) soluble antigens from infected patient plasma, Western blotting, thermal stability and ELISA assays using hyperimmune IgG-antimalaria antibodies was the main objective of this work. A circulating antigen of approximately Mr 33-35 kDa with good specificity and antigenicity, in the plasma of malarial patients was shown. Heating at 100 degrees C did not destroy its antigenicity. When fractions highly enriched in the 33-35 kDa proteins were used in ELISAs, a seroreactivity in plasma obtained from primary-infected individuals was found. Controls from normal patients were always negative. The antigenic characteristics suggest that it may be included within the group of new described Plasmodium soluble antigens.
