Percutaneous abscess drainage: update. During the approximately 20 years that percutaneous abscess drainage (PAD) has been an extant procedure and as the millennium begins, PAD has become, by consensus, the treatment of choice for abscesses. Indications for PAD continue to expand, and currently almost all abscesses are considered amenable. On occasion, PAD is an adjunctive procedure that provides a beneficial temporizing effect for the surgeon who eventually must operate for a coexisting problem such as a bowel leak. Simple unilocular abscesses are cured almost uniformly by PAD more complicated abscesses, such as those with enteric fistulas (e.g., diverticular abscess) or pancreatic abscesses, have cure rates ranging from 65% to 90%. Various catheters and insertion techniques have proven effective. Ultrasonography, computed tomography, and fluoroscopy are the staple modalities that guide PAD. PAD is the prototype interventional radiology procedure, providing detection of the abscess by imaging, needling for diagnosis, and catheterization for therapy.
