Diagnosis of malaria in non-endemic countries by the ParaSight-F test. QBC, examination of thin blood smears, and Parasight-F were performed for every case of malaria suspected between May 1997 and December 1998. Data from 310 patients were reported. Fifty had malaria infection diagnosed by QBC and thin blood film, among whom 39 had Plasmodium falciparum infection. Three of these 39 were negative with the Parasight-F test. Eleven patients had a positive ParaSight-F test but microscopic diagnosis methods were negative. Interpretation of these 11 positive ParaSight-F results is proposed to depend on clinical criteria.
