Short report: IgG1/IgG3 antibody responses to various analogs of recombinant ypfmsp119--a study in immune adults living in areas of Plasmodium falciparum transmission. To further characterize protective-type (IgG1/IgG3) antibody responses to Plasmodium falciparum blood stage in putatively immune individuals' plasma, we have tested for various analogs of the 19 kDa C-terminus of the MSP1 antigen obtained as secreted recombinant proteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. One of four proteins was then identified on the basis of consistent IgG3, along with less variable IgG1 recognition. This protein has thus been selected for further functional assays of IgG1/IgG3 antibodies.
