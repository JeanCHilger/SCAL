CT diagnosed jejunal intussusception revealing metastatic renal cell carcinoma. We report the case of a 77-year-old woman presenting with a jejunal intussusception as the primary symtom of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Both lesions were demonstrated by abdominal CT which detected also pancreatic metastasis. This case emphasizes the significance of CT to diagnose intussusception and to characterize its cause.
