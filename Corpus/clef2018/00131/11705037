A case of hydatid cyst in the pancreatic head causing obstructive jaundice. The patient (male age = 69) was referred to the Department of 1st Surgery upon suspicion of obstructive jaundice. He was admitted to the Department of Internal Medicine with back pain, loss of appetite, and jaundice and some laboratory tests were performed. He has no history of alcohol use. During his physical examination, pain was noted in the upper right quadrant and the gall bladder was palpable and hydropic. A 22 mm. cystic structure with smooth contours was detected in the abdominal CT scan. An exploratory laparatomy was planned. During the perioperative cyst aspiration, the laminar membrane of hydatic cyst led to the probable diagnosis of hydatic cyst. Cholecystectomy, choledochoduodenostomy, partial cystectomy and capitonnage was performed. The patient was started on 800 mg/day albendazole during postoperative period and then was discharged.
