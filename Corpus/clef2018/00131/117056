Improved detection of immune complexes in human and mouse serum using a microassay adaptation of the C1Q binding test. A microassay adaptation of the [125I]C1q binding test for the detection of circulating immune complexes is described. This technique is more rapid to perform, requires smaller volumes of serum and reagents, and surprisingly, increases the sensitivity of the assay when compared to the previously reported C1q binding method.
