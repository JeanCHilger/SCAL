Hemosuccus pancreaticus: diagnosis with CT and MRI and treatment with transcatheter embolization. We report the case of a 56-year-old woman with a presyncopal episode followed by melena. A sentinel clot sign in the pancreatic duct on precontrast computed tomography and the presence of a splenic artery aneurysm on postcontrast computed tomography strongly suggested a fistula between the aneurysm and the duct, as visualized by magnetic resonance imaging. The patient was treated successfully by complete embolization of the splenic artery aneurysm.
