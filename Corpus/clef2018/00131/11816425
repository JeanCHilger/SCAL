The feeding behaviour and Plasmodium infection of Anopheles mosquitoes in southern Ethiopia in relation to use of insecticide-treated livestock for malaria control. Anopheles arabiensis and An. quadriannulatus species B mosquitoes were collected at sites of human and livestock housing and analysed for blood feeding patterns and infection with malaria sporozoites. A low percentage of human blood meals at some sites suggested that zooprophylaxis could be effective in reducing challenge from Plasmodium falciparum.
