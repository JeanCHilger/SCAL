Prevention and management of infections in patients without a spleen. Patients who lack a functioning spleen become vulnerable to sepsis caused by bacteria and, occasionally, protozoa. The risk is higher in children and in those who have had immunosuppressive treatment, and the risk remains lifelong. Overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI) occurs at an estimated incidence of 0.23-0.42% per year, with a lifetime risk of 5%. Episodes of OPSI are emergencies, requiring immediate parental antibiotics and intensive care intravenous immunoglobulins may be useful. OPSI carries a mortality of 38-69%. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the commonest infecting organism, accounting for 50-90% of isolates from blood cultures in reported series
