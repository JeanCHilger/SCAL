Leiomyosarcoma and stromal tumor of the pancreas. A tumor of the head of pancreas was an incidental finding on US of two patients aged 52 and 61 years presenting with abdominal pain. The tumor was studied by computed tomography, MRI and endoscopic ultrasonography. Surgical biopsy of a liver lesion was performed in one case and partial duodenopancreatectomy was performed in the other case. Histological evaluation, including immunohistochemistry, showed leiomyosarcoma and stromal tumor respectively. Whatever the site of origin, most mesenchymal pancreatic tumors are hypervascular, heterogeneous and have a necrotic center.
