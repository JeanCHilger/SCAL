Value of MR pancreatography in the evaluation of patients with chronic pancreatitis. To determine the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance (MR) pancreatography and to define its role in the imaging work-up of patients with severe chronic pancreatitis.Thirty-two patients (13 men and 19 women 15-84 years oldWhen compared to the final diagnosis, MR pancreatography showed the following sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy: for filling defects in pancreatic duct, 56-78%, 100% and 87-94%, respectively for strictures, 75-88%, 92-96% and 88-94%, respectivelyMR pancreatography is poorly sensitive but specific in revealing pancreatic duct filling defects and strictures. However, when MR pancreatography is interpreted in combination with sonography and CT, it provides sufficient information to plan therapy in the majority of patients.
