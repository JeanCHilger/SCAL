Diagnosis of malaria using thick bloodsmears: definition and evaluation of a faster protocol with improved readability. The value of some inexpensive modifications to the standard method of preparing thick bloodsmears, involving rapid drying, an isotonic fixative and a haemolysing solution containing saponin, was evaluated. The drying, haemolysing, fixing and staining steps, together called the fast-thick-smear method (FTS), can be completed in < 10 min. The FTS and a more classical thick-smear method (CTS) were both used on each of 1185 samples of venous blood samples from 1034 cases of suspected malaria (all international travellers returning to France). The results indicated that there was no statistically significant differences between the two methods in terms of their sensitivity, specificity or predictive values for parasite detection. However, estimates of the intensities of the Plasmodium falciparum infections observed, based on counts of trophozoites against 200 leucocytes, were markedly higher (37.8% higher overall) with the FTS than with the CTS (P < 0.0001). Moreover, the concordance between results obtained by inexperienced and experienced microscopists was excellent when the FTS was used, with a kappa value of 0.96 (95% confidence interval = 0.93-0.98).
