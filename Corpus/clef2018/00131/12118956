Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography should no longer be used as a diagnostic test: the case in favour. The requirement for diagnostic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography has decreased considerably in the past 10 years. Alternative imaging techniques are now available for the diagnosis of bile duct stones, pancreatic and biliary tract malignancy and inflammatory diseases such as sclerosing cholangitis and chronic pancreatitis. The imaging techniques include endoscopic ultrasonography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and helical computed tomography. There is good evidence that these techniques have an accuracy comparable to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in the diagnosis of diseases of the bile and pancreatic ducts. All of these methods are less invasive than endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and have extremely low or negligible complication rates. The choice of technique used depends on local availability and expertise. In future, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography will be reserved exclusively for therapeutic applications.
