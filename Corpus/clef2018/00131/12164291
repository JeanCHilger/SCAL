Field evaluation of the ICT Malaria Pf/Pv immunochromatographic test for the detection of asymptomatic malaria in a Plasmodium falciparum/vivax endemic area in Thailand. Rapid antigen assays provide an effective tool for the detection of malaria in symptomatic patients. However, the efficacy of these devices for detecting asymptomatic malaria, where parasite levels are normally significantly lower than in symptomatic patients, is less well established. We evaluated the efficacy of a new combined Plasmodium falciparum-Plasmodim vivax immunochromatographic test (ICT Malaria Pf/Pv) in a cross-sectional malaria survey of the village of Ban Kong Mong Tha, Kanchanaburi Provice, Thailand, from August to December 2000. A total of 1,976 bleeds were made from 559 individuals over the course of the study. Blinded microscopy of thick and thin blood films was used as the gold standard all discordant and 10% of concordant results were cross-checked. Of 1,976 ICT Malaria Pf/Pv dipsticks tested, 98.3% (n = 1,943) performed as expected, as evidenced by the appearance of the control line. The ICT Malaria Pf/Pv test was both sensitive (100.0%) and specific (99.7 %) for the diagnosis of falciparum malaria with parasitemias of > or = 500 trophozoites/microL
