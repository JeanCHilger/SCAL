New strategies for the diagnosis and screening of malaria. Thin and thick blood film microscopy are the "gold standard" for malaria diagnosis. In recent years, there have been important developments in malaria diagnostic tests including fluorescence microscopy of malaria parasites stained with acridine orange, dipstick immunoassays that detect species-specific parasite antigens, and more recently, detection of parasite nucleic acids after amplification by PCR. With some of these methods, sensitivities and specificities approaching and even exceeding those of the thin and thick film can be attained. In particular, PCR-based tests for plasmodium DNA or RNA are more sensitive and specific than other tests for malarial parasites. A specific application for PCR diagnosis of malaria could be blood donor screening. Clinical trials of blood donor sreening for malarial parasites by PCR are being conducted, in which pooled donor samples are screened to increase efficiency and reduce costs. Some of the new diagnostic methods may have specific applications in particular settings, depending on the purpose and location of testing, and other factors such as cost, desired sensitivity and specificity, speed and ease of use.
