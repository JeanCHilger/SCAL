Clinical value of spiral CT in the surgical treatment of severe acute pancreatitis. To evaluate the clinical value of spiral CT in the surgical treatment of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP).The morphological changes in the spiral CT images of 82 SAP patients were contrasted with the therapeutic methods and the curative effects.The operation for obstructive biliogenic pancreatitis, invasive parapancreas vessels forming angioma, piece and segmental necrosis in the body and tail of the pancreas, the enlargement of pancreas cyst during the treatment, and parapancreas abscess diagnosed by the spiral CT images had a significant curative effect compared with the non-operation treatment (P < 0.05). The satisfactory effect could be gained if a conservative treatment was performed first, and then the delayed operative treatment was carried out according to the etiologic and clinical data for the SAP patients with extensive phlegmona, necrosis in the head of the pancreas, severe parapancreas cyst, and a large amount of ascite.Spiral CT can supply the grounds for choosing surgical methods and the surgical opportunity in the treatment of SAP patients.
