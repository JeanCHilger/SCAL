Design and development of an immunosensor for the detection of malaria in field conditions. Eradication of malaria in Southeast Asian countries is still a distant goal, due to the absence of a simple, rapid and inexpensive diagnostic technique. Here, an immunosensor for the photometric detection of malaria, the malaria-detecting immunosensor (MDI), is developed to detect Plasmodium falciparum malarial antibodies in human blood. The method uses the principle of laser light-scattering by latex bead agglutinates in media monitored by a light-detecting device. Agglutination is induced by mixing antigen-coated latex beads with serum antibodies. Immunoreactions are measured in terms of the Tyndall effect in the transmitted beam detected by photodiodes. MDI sensitivity and specificity are compared with the results of enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay and laser light-scattering immunoassay techniques, which show that it is a good and sensitive monitoring device.
