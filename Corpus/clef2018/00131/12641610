Automated detection of malaria-associated intraleucocytic haemozoin by Cell-Dyn CD4000 depolarization analysis. Laboratory tests for malaria are only performed if there is clinical suspicion of the disease, and a missed diagnosis contributes substantially to morbidity and mortality. Malaria parasites produce haemozoin, which is able to depolarize light and this allows the automated detection of malaria during routine complete blood count analysis (CBC) with some Abbott Cell-Dyn instruments. In this study, we evaluated the Cell-Dyn CD4000 with 831 blood samples submitted for malaria investigations. Samples were categorized as malaria negative (n = 417), convalescent malaria (n = 64) or malaria positive (n = 350) by reference to thin/thick film microscopy, 'rapid test' procedures, polymerase chain reaction analysis and clinical history. With regard to CD4000 depolarization analysis, a malaria positive CD4000 pattern was ascribed to samples that showed one or more abnormal depolarizing purple events, which corresponded to monocytes containing ingested malaria pigment (haemozoin). Positive CD4000 patterns were observed in 11 of 417, 50 of 64 and 281 of 350 of malaria negative, convalescent malaria and malaria positive samples respectively. The specificity and positive predictive values for malaria (active and convalescent) were very high (97.4 and 96.8%, respectively), while sensitivity and negative predictive values were 80.0 and 83.0% respectively. Depolarization analysis was particularly effective for Plasmodium falciparum malaria but there was lower detection sensitivity for White compared with Black African patients. CD4000 90 degrees depolarization vs 0 degrees analysis revealed a proportion of samples with small nonleucocyte-associated depolarizing particles. Appearance of such events in the form of a discrete cluster was associated with P. vivax rather than P. falciparum infection.
