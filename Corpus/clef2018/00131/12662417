The hospital- and field-based performances of the OptiMAL test, for malaria diagnosis and treatment monitoring in central India. The performance of the OptiMAL test, to detect and differentiate Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax, was evaluated in central India. The subjects were either symptomatic patients, who presented at a referral hospital in urban Jabalpur, or the inhabitants of remote, tribal, forested villages where malaria is a major public-health problem. In each setting, the results of conventional microscopy were used as the 'gold standard'. Under hospital conditions, the test had excellent sensitivity (100%), good specificity (97%), a high positive predictive value (98%) and a high negative predictive value (100%). The corresponding values in the field-based study in the tribal villages (100%, 67%, 84% and 100%, respectively) were almost as good. The results of OptiMAL testing reveal the decline in parasitaemias (of P. falciparum or P. vivax) after drug administration. For monitoring the effectiveness of treatment, the test could therefore be a useful alternative to microscopy, particularly (1) in places where the facilities for microscopy are poor or non-existent and (2) among hospitalized patients with severe, complicated malaria (in whom parasitaemia and drug response need to be followed very carefully). Follow-up (within 28 days of diagnosis) of the 58 malaria cases detected in the field revealed that the OptiMAL test can be used to detect re-infection with a different Plasmodium sp.
