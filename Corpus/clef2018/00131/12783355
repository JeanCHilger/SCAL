Pancreatic intraductal ultrasonography (IDUS) allows early diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma in situ: a case report. A 66-year-old woman was admitted with diarrhea, weight loss, slight recurrent abdominal pain, and raised serum amylase and lipase. Lactose intolerance was diagnosed, and treatment was begun. The symptoms diminished. However, slight back pain and elevated serum amylase and lipase levels persisted. A pancreatic tumor was then suspected. Ultrasound, spiral computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) examinations were inconclusive. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) showed a slight narrowing of the pancreatic duct within the pancreatic body, and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) revealed a 10 mm intrapancreatic lesion. Finally, intraductal ultrasonography (IDUS) reliably identified a small pancreatic tumor. The tumor was resected, and histology confirmed a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma in situ (UICC stage 0, TisN0M0). This case shows that using high-resolution imaging techniques such as EUS plus IDUS, small malignant pancreatic lesions can be detected at an early stage, when curative action is possible.
