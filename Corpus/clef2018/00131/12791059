Malaria dipsticks beneficial for IMCI in Cambodia. The Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) approach and new clinical treatment guidelines to control malaria among children less than 5 years old were introduced recently in Cambodia. This study was conducted to finalize the malaria part of the national IMCI fever chart.A total of 323 sick children 2-59 months old were studied at rural health centres in northern Cambodia from February to April 2000. Cases with fever (by axillary temperature or history) or anaemia (by palmar pallor) were tested with dipsticks for Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax in high and low malaria risk areas and, if positive, treated with anti-malarials.The draft IMCI chart identified children with malaria safely and effectively (sensitivity 14 of 15, approximately 93% and specificity 292 of 308, approximately 95%). The study confirmed the potential of malaria dipsticks as a part of IMCI case management.The Cambodian Ministry of Health will use the studied malaria chart during the Early Implementation Phase of IMCI. Dipsticks able to detect P. falciparum and P. vivax with high sensitivity and acceptable cost will be needed for this purpose. To promote the rational use of dipsticks, the National Centre for Malaria Control, Parasitology and Entomology (Centre National de Malaridogie, Parasitologie et Entomologie, CNM) should list all known malaria risk areas in the country and prepare detailed local maps guiding case management especially in transitional zones.
