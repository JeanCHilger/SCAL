Delayed clearance of Plasmodium falciparum in patients with human immunodeficiency virus co-infection treated with artemisinin. We investigated the effect of artemisinin on the rate of clearance of Plasmodium falciparum in patients with or without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection. Initial mean (+/- SEM) parasite density was not different between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected groups (27,486 +/- 2,643 versus 32,892 +/- 6,583, respectively P = 0.55). The mean (+/- SEM) time to clear 75% and 90% of the parasites was 23.1 hr +/- 1.8 and 29.3 hr +/- 1.9, respectively, for the HIV seropositive patients compared with 16.0 hr +/- 1.4 and 20.8 hr +/- 1.4, respectively for the HIV seronegative patients (P = 0.0075 and 0.0026, respectively). By 32 hr, almost all (6/7) HIV positive patients remained parasitemic in contrast with 2/12 HIV seronegative patients. Moreover, the mean parasite density was almost 12-fold higher in the HIV seropositive patients than in the HIV seronegative patients at the same period (1789 +/- 616 versus 150 +/- 118, respectively
