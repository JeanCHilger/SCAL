Reactivity of sera from cases of Plasmodium vivax malaria towards three recombinant antigens based on the surface proteins of the parasite. Sera collected in South Korea, from 61 cases of Plasmodium vivax malaria and, as controls, 40 healthy volunteers, were tested in ELISA for IgG or IgM reacting with any of three recombinant P. vivax proteins. The antigens used, representing the parasite's major merozoite surface protein (MSP), circumsporozoite surface protein (CSP) and Duffy-binding protein (DBP), had all been expressed in an Escherichia coli system and purified. The ELISA results were recorded as optical densities (OD). The highest ratio observed between the mean OD for a malaria serum and that for a control serum was that for IgG against MSP, although CSP gave a higher ratio than MSP or DBP in the IgM ELISA. In the ELISA for IgG, the OD for MSP were found to be correlated with those for DBP (r = 0.53 P < 0.5) but the OD for CSP were not correlated with those for MSP or DBP. As the most intense reactions observed were those between the IgG from the malaria sera and the recombinant MSP, the latter antigen may be useful in diagnostic tests and as a component of any vaccine used to protect against P. vivax malaria.
