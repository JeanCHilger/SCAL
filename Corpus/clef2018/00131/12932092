Rapid diagnostic devices for malaria: field evaluation of a new prototype immunochromatographic assay for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum and non-falciparum Plasmodium. The NOW ICT Malaria P.f./P.v. for Whole Blood (Binax, Inc., Portland, ME) is a new malaria rapid diagnostic device that represents a technical advance over previous assays, such as ICT Malaria P.f./P.v. and ICT Malaria P.f.. We evaluated this device in March 2001 in symptomatic patients at malaria clinics in Maesod, Thailand. Microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained blood smears was the reference standard. In 246 patients, microscopy showed 32 (13.0%) infected with Plasmodium falciparum, 63 (25.6%) with P. vivax, 6 (2.4%) with mixed infections of P. falciparum and P. vivax, 5 (2.0%) with P. malariae, and 140 (56.9%) negative. Sensitivity for P. falciparum was 100% and specificity was 96.2% (200 of 208 95% confidence interval [CI] = 92-98). For P. vivax, sensitivity was 87.3% (55 of 63
