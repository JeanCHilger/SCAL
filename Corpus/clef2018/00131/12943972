Humoral responses to defined malaria antigens in children living since birth under insecticide treated curtains in Burkina Faso. Insecticide treated materials (ITM) are considered a useful malaria control measure for endemic countries, but whether they also delay the acquisition of immunity to malaria remains unclear. This study investigates plasma antibody levels in 160 children aged 3-6 years from five villages protected by insecticide treated curtains (ITC) over 6 years and in 184 children of the same age group from five villages in the same area never covered by ITC. The antigens to which antibodies were investigated were: the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP) repetitive sequence (NANP)5 the C-terminal domain of the P. falciparum exported protein 1 (Cter-PfExp1)
