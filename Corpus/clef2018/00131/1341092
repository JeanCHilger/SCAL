Prenatal immune hypersensitization to malaria: Plasmodium falciparum-specific IgE antibody in paired maternal and cord sera from Papua New Guinea. In a study of malaria and pregnancy in East Sepik Province of Papua New Guinea 45 maternal and cord serum pairs were tested for Plasmodium falciparum-specific IgE antibody. There were 17 positive sera: 6 cases of maternal serum alone, 5 cases of cord serum alone and 3 pairs of maternal and cord sera. IgE antibody positivity rates in the mothers increased with parity, whereas placental parasitaemia rates decreased. Cord serum positivity was not affected by parity. Immunoblots of the sera revealed a diversity of IgE antibodies to specific antigens of the P. falciparum lysate, but an IgE antibody to a 48kd antigen was present in all positive maternal and cord sera.
