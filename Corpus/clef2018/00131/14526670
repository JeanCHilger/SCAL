Accuracy of cytologic interpretation of pancreatic neoplasms by fine needle aspiration and pancreatic duct brushings. To investigate the accuracy of fine needle aspiration (FNA) specimens and pancreatic duct brushings in the detection of pancreatic lesions and to compare the results with follow-up biopsy and/or surgical interpretation.We reviewed a total of 57 specimens (37/20), 37 FNA specimens and 20 pancreatic duct brushings, from 45 patients treated at Froedtert Memorial Lutheran Hospital, affiliated with the Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, over a 4-year period. The FNA and brushing samples were categorized as follows: positive for malignancy (21/3 = 24), suspicious for malignancy (8/7 = 15) and atypical (8/10 = 18). The results were then correlated with the tissue diagnosis.The 24 cytologic samples positive for malignancy included 23 (20/3) pancreatic ductal carcinoma (CA) and 1 (1/0) neuroendocrine CA in the suspicious category, 11 (6/5) were pancreatic ductal CAPancreatic FNA and duct brushings [table: see text] are accurate methods in identifying pancreatic lesions, particularly ductal CA. Accuracy can be improved in the case of mucinous and other lesions with adequate cellularity of the smear and recognizing the limitations of brush samples in the case of mucinous cystic lesions. False negative results may occur in cases of poor representation of malignant cells or poor sampling.
