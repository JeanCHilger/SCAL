Long-term follow-up of patients with clinically indeterminate suspicion of pancreatic cancer and normal EUS. EUS often is performed because of a clinical suspicion of pancreatic cancer when the results of other noninvasive diagnostic tests are indeterminate. The aim of this study was to determine the true negative predictive value of a normal EUS in a cohort of patients with an indeterminate suspicion of pancreatic cancer by obtaining long-term follow-up information.Patients referred for EUS of the pancreas for the following indications were identified: elevated carbohydrate-associated antigen (CA 19-9) without other definitive evidence of pancreatic cancer, subtle abnormalities on CT of the pancreas, and unexplained abdominal pain and/or weight loss. Endoscopy procedure reports, as well as inpatient and outpatient records were obtained. In addition, referring physicians, as well as patients, were contacted to acquire adequate follow-up information.A total of 80 patients were included in the study. Follow-up of at least 6 months was obtained for 76 (95%) patients (mean follow-up 23.9 months). No patient with a normal EUS of the pancreas developed pancreatic cancer or required pancreatic surgery during the follow-up period. One patient in whom a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis was made by EUS subsequently was found to have pancreatic cancer at surgery.A normal EUS of the pancreas in the setting of subtle radiologic findings, serologic abnormalities, and/or nonspecific symptoms definitively rules out the presence of pancreatic cancer.
