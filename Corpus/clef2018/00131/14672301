Experiences of a community-based dietary intervention to enhance micronutrient adequacy of diets low in animal source foods and high in phytate: a case study in rural Malawian children. A community-based dietary diversification/modification intervention, employing a quasiexperimental design with a nonequivalent control group, was conducted in two intervention and two control villages in rural Southern Malawi. The aim was to enhance the content and bioavailability of micronutrients in maize-based diets of stunted children ages 30-90 mo. Efficacy was evaluated through a comparison of the changes in knowledge and practices, anthropometry, malaria screening, hemoglobin and hair zinc after 12 mo, common infections monthly postintervention and nutrient adequacy postintervention via 24-h recalls. Intervention diets were more diverse and of higher quality than the control diets, supplying significantly more animal source foods, especially soft-boned fish, but less phytic acid (p < 0.01). Median intakes of energy, protein, calcium, available zinc, heme iron and vitamin B-12 were greater (p < 0.05) in intervention compared to the control groups some spread of knowledge and practices to the control groups occurred. Intervention enhanced Z-scores for mid-upper-arm circumference and arm muscle area (p < 0.001), but had no impact on weight or height gain. After controlling for baseline variables, mean hemoglobin was higher (107 vs. 102 g/L
