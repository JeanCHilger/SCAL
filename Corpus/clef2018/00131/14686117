Study of malaria in a village of lower Myanmar. Malaria endemicity in lower Myanmar has been studied to identify the causes for the prevalence of malaria in Yeasitkan village of lower Myanmar. Vector mosquitoes were collected by mosquito net in cattlesheds and in human dwellings (indoor and outdoor) by biting and catching procedure for the identification of species, insecticide susceptibility test and sporozoites detection. Larvae of mosquitoes were also collected in and around the village for vector identification and for breeding sources. Malaria infection in humans was examined by blood examination and blood antibody detection by ELISA method. Results showed that malaria infection was 43.2% in children under 10 years of age and An. dirus and An. minimus were found as main vectors. Total parasite positive rate was found to be 41.28% and in this 78.87% were P. falciparum infections and remaining 18.31% were of P. vivax. Spleen positive rate has been found very high in children between 2 and 9 years (52.94%). Study indicates that villages near to dam areas are more prone to malaria infection.
