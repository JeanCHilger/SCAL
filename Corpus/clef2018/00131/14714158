Imaging in pancreatic infection. The most common cause of infection involving the pancreas is complicated pancreatitis. Infected necrosis, pancreatic abscess, and infection of pancreatic pseudocysts are seen. Diagnostic imaging, in particular, contrast-enhanced computed tomography, plays a large role in the identification of the complications seen in acute pancreatitis. The imaging findings of the infectious complications of pancreatitis is reviewed. Diagnostic imaging also plays a role in the diagnosis of infected necrosis and in the percutaneous management of pancreatic abscesses and pseudocysts. The imaging findings of pancreatic necrosis are usually not sensitive to the presence of co-existent infection. Image-guided needle aspiration of the necrotic pancreas can be crucial in the diagnosis of infected necrosis. Image-guided placement of percutaneous drainage catheters is a nonsurgical alternative for the management of pancreatic abscesses and pseudocysts. Image-guided catheter placement and the management of these catheters is discussed.
