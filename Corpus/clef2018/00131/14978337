Comparison of immunological responses to the various types circumsporozoite proteins of Plasmodium vivax in malaria patients of Korea. We compared the seroreactivities against four synthetic peptide antigens (VK210, VK247, Korean type 1, and type 2) and a full length recombinant circumsporozoite protein (CSP) antigen of Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax ) in samples of sixty-three tertian malaria patients in Korea. Among the various CSP antigens, the full-length recombinant CSP showed the highest reactivity in malaria-exposed groups (85.7%, 54/63). No significant difference was found in the percentage of malaria patients with antibodies among four peptides examined, except a full-length recombinant CSP. Absorbance values from the peptide-based ELISA showed high correlations (r > 0.9, P < 0.05) at significant values. Five sera without the immunoaffinity against peptides were reactive towards the full-length recombinant CSP in ELISA. Sera, which were not reactive to a full length recombinant CSP antigen, were not recognized by any of peptide based ELISA. These data suggested that peptide structures included in Korean isolates, GNGAGGQAA, and VK247 peptides had immune reactivity and recognition epitopes. Among the antigens, GNGAGGQAA was less recognized by patients exposed to Korean strains of P. vivax in comparison to the VK210 structures.
