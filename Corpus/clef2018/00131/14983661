Solid cystic pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas: report of one case. Solid cystic pseudopapillary tumors of the pancreas (Frantz's tumor) are rare in children. We present a 12-year-old child with a pancreatic tumor without initial symptoms or signs until the tumor compressed the adjacent organs. The child had clinical presentation of intermittent abdominal cramping pain, vomiting, changes in bowel habits and decreased of appetite for 2 days. The abdominal computed tomography showed a mass that measuring 6 x 7 x 7 cm at the right upper quadrate. Whipple operations with pylorus-preserved pancreato-duodenectomy and cholecystectomy were performed. The definite diagnosis was made by the post-operation pathological finding. Grossly, the tumor was encapsulated with cystic degeneration and hemorrhagic necrosis appearance. Microscopically, it had predominantly papillary arrangement mixed with solid areas. Prognosis of this tumor was good under complete resection. The patient remained well with no signs of recurrence or malignant changes at 1 year after operation. Due to the possibility of recurrence, close follow up is recommended.
