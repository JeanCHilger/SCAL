Diagnosis of tropical malaria by express-methods. An examination of a thick blood drop and of blood smear for the presence of plasmodia is a classic and indisputable diagnostic test for tropic malaria. However, express-methods, based on the immune-enzyme analysis, have been introduced into the health-care practice primarily in developing and underdeveloped countries. The diagnosis of tropic malaria by using the discussed methods enables, in the non-laboratory settings, a rapid and reliable detection of PI. falciparum in blood. This is important because an untimely diagnosis of tropic malaria increases the risk of the lethal outcome.
