Aneurysm of the pancreaticoduodenal arteries with a celiac trunk lesion: current management. We report a ruptured aneurysm of the pancreaticoduodenal arteries without acute or chronic pancreatitis but associated with a median arcuate ligament division that compressed the celiac trunk, an exceptional event, thus far described in only 11 patients. We also conducted a targeted review to seek information about clinical presentation, to hasten diagnosis and assist in therapeutic management.A 54-year-old man with retroperitoneal hemorrhage associated with an arcuate ligament division, documented on computed tomographic scans, underwent diagnostic arteriography and embolization to treat the bleeding aneurysm. In a second elective operation the causative arcuate ligament was sectioned to decompress the celiac artery, to prevent aneurysm recurrence.Embolization stopped the aneurysmal bleeding, and arteriograms showed that surgical sectioning resolved the celiac trunk stenosis. At 1-year follow-up the patient had no signs of complications or recurrence of disease.Ruptured aneurysm of the pancreaticoduodenal arteries associated with stenosis of the celiac trunk is a surgical emergency. Although a literature review disclosed no significant difference between outcomes after open surgery and radiologic arterial embolization, our experience in this case suggests immediate embolization during arteriography as the most effective treatment. Later, to prevent recurrence, the arcuate ligament should be surgically sectioned and the celiac artery stenosis treated.
