Relative utility of dipsticks for diagnosis of malaria in mesoendemic area for Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax in northeastern India. For diagnosis of malaria, popular brands of rapid test kits collectively termed as "dipsticks" were subject to field evaluation in northeastern India for their comparative sensitivity and specificity vis-Ã -vis conventional microscopic results. Dipsticks based on Plasmodium falciparum-specific histidine-rich protein (Pf HRP-2) antigen capture assay revealed 100% sensitivity and high specificity (94-100%) thus, they were concluded to be reliable tools for confirmed diagnosis of malarial infection. However, an advanced version of the same kit, having incorporated additional pan-malarial monoclonal antibody, was found to be less sensitive (71%) for non-falciparum infections. Besides, Pf HRP-2-based kits continued to show positive results up to day 7, even after clearance of parasitemia on account of persistent antigenemia. This very limitation seemed to have been overcome by parasite-specific lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) enzyme-based kit. This kit was observed to have high sensitivity (81-89%) and specificity (100%) for both falciparum and non-falciparum malaria, but cannot distinguish mono-infection from mixed infections. It is concluded that the rational use of these kits would accord health benefits in terms of early detection and prompt treatment, reduce drug pressure, and possibly delay the emergence and spread of multi-drug-resistant strains of malarial parasites.
