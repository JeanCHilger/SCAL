Possible role of Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor receptor (GM-CSF R) in malaria. Malaria has been reportedly increasing in incidence on the globe. Evidence from clinical studies supports a role for cytokines in the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria. Given the stimulatory effect of the ligand GM-CSF on the synthesis and release of the pyrogenic cytokine TNF alpha, the present study has been undertaken to investigate a possible role of GMCSF receptor in the pathogenesis of both Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum malaria. An enzyme immunoassay developed by us at our laboratory for the quantitation of GM-CSF receptor has been used. No changes in the concentration of the receptor have been indicated either at the time of diagnosis or after treatment. In addition, an intercomparison of the receptor concentration between the P. vivax and P. falciparum groups does not show any significant difference. The results suggest that GM-CSF receptor has no significant role in the pathogenesis of either type of malaria.
