Role of the prevalent Anopheles species in the transmission of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax in Assam state, north-eastern India. In north-eastern India, Anopheles minimus, An. dirus and An. fluviatilis are considered the three major vectors of the parasites causing human malaria. The role in transmission of the other Anopheles species present in this region is not, however, very clear. To examine the vectorial role of the more common anopheline mosquitoes, the heads and thoraces of 4126 female Anopheles belonging to 16 species (collected using miniature light traps set in human dwellings in a foothill village in the Jorhat district of Assam state) were tested, in ELISA, for the circumsporozoite proteins (CSP) of Plasmodium falciparum or the VK-210 and VK-247 polymorphs of P. vivax. Sixty-five pools of head-thorax homogenates, representing 10 different species of Anopheles, were found reactive, giving an overall minimum prevalence of infection (MPI) of 1.58%, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.21%-2.0%. Among the CSP-reactive pools of mosquitoes, 31% were positive only for P. falciparum, 45% only for P. vivax VK 247, 6% only for P. vivax VK 210, and 18% for both P. falciparum and P. vivax VK 247. The results indicate that not only the proven vector, An. minimus s.l. (MPI = 0.71%), but also several species of Anopheles previously considered unimportant in the epidemiology of malaria, especially An. aconitus (MPI = 3.95%), An. annularis (MPI = 5.8%), the An. hyrcanus group (MPI = 0.48%), An. kochi (MPI = 1.28%), the An. philippinensis-nivipes complex (MPI = 0.94%), and An. vagus (MPI = 3.87%), are important vectors in the foothills of Assam.
