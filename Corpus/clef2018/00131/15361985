Umbilical mass as the sole presenting symptom of pancreatic cancer: a case report. Umbilical nodes are rare. The metastatic involvement of the region was first described in 1846. Sister Mary Joseph was the first observer to establish the correlation between carcinomas and umbilical nodes. The umbilical node may be the sole presenting sign of cancer and is usually associated with advanced disease and poor prognosis. A 64-year-old woman, previously healthy, presented vague abdominal discomfort and a hard umbilical nodule for 1 week, which was first diagnosed as an incarcerated umbilical hernia. She underwent a new clinical assessment and biopsy. After immunohistochemical analysis and computerized tomography, she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. The clinical staging showed advanced disease with distant metastasis. She received palliative chemotherapy. After 8 months, she was alive in poor clinical condition. Clinical suspicion should lead to a careful additional evaluation whenever an umbilical nodule presents with malignant signs.
