An infant with tuberculosis who previously contacted an infant with congenital tuberculosis. We report a case of one-year and three-month old male infant with healed tuberculosis who was found by positive tuberculin skin test prior to scheduled BCG vaccination. Abdominal CT imaging revealed calcification in liver, spleen, and lymphnodes along pancreas and hepato-duodenal ligament, despite of normal chest imaging. A temporary intubated infant with congenital tuberculosis and/or his mother with untreated tuberculosis might infect him during his stay in the same NICU when he had digestive disease at three-month old. This report suggests that periodic contact investigation is needed for infants who had contact with the intubated infant with congenital tuberculosis in the same room, since cell-mediated immunity is not well developed in infants.
