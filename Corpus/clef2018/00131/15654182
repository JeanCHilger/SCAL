Pancreatic abscess secondary to Alcaligenes faecalis. We report a patient with pancreatic abscesses and necrosis secondary to Alcaligenes faecalis infection. He initially presented with alcohol-induced acute pancreatitis. Twenty days after the initial presentation, he re-presented with increasing pain and was found to have pancreatic necrosis and abscesses. Treatment was initiated with meropenem. Because of persistent fevers, computed tomography-guided drainage was performed. The fluid grew A faecalis resistant to meropenem and the patient continued to be febrile. He recovered only after adequate surgical intervention and appropriate antibiotic coverage. Although this is the first case of A faecalis reported to cause pancreatic abscess, we believe selection of this organism occurred because surgical drainage was delayed while the patient was on the recommended treatment with meropenem. This case emphasizes the need for early surgical drainage of pancreatic abscesses to avoid the selection of such resistant pathogens.
