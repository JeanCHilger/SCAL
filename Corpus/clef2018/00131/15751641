Local recurrence of pancreatic cancer successfully treated with gemcitabine. We report a patient for whom systemic chemotherapy using gemcitabine was effective against local recurrence of pancreatic cancer. A 58-year-old man underwent pancreatoduodenectomy for a pancreatic head cancer. The diagnosis was Stage IVb poorly-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma, scirrhous type, pT4, PL (+), P0, H0, pN2. However, after 21 months, gastrointestinal bleeding occurred. Gastroscopy and CT examination revealed a mass at the cut-end of the pancreas invading the stomach. The serum CA19-9 level was found to be elevated. Systemic chemotherapy was performed with a regimen of gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m2/week for 2 weeks, followed by a week rest. The recurrent tumor in the stomach disappeared, and the mass at the cut-end of the pancreas became small. The serum CA 19-9 level regained the normal value. Two years after the diagnosis of recurrence, he returned to work, and his chemotherapy is being continued as an outpatient.
