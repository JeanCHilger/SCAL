Willingness to pay for hypothetical malaria vaccines in rural Burkina Faso. This study aims to set priorities for anti-disease malaria vaccines by determining community preference in a hyperendemic area.A bidding game technique was used to elucidate willingness to pay in rural Burkina Faso and 2,326 adults were interviewed.It is shown that there are significant differences between community preference for an anti-disease vaccine aimed at reducing pathology in pregnant women, and for a vaccine directed against childhood malaria. While the target population was willing to pay CFAfr 2101 for a vaccine against maternal malaria, its members were prepared to pay only CFAfr 1433 for a vaccine against childhood malaria.Whilst it is increasingly likely that anti-disease malaria vaccines will become available in the foreseeable future, lessons from the past suggest that a lack of acceptance and support from the intended recipients may lead to less than optimal compliance, and hence efficacy. For the planning of vaccine development and application strategies, it is therefore highly important to take community views into account. Here it is argued that such information could help researchers and funding agencies to set priorities for future vaccine research.
