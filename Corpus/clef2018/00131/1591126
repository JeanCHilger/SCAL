Radiologic approach to bile duct cysts in adults. Radiologic findings in 7 adult patients with bile duct cysts were reviewed. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed in 6 patients, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) in 4, CT and ultrasonography (US) in 4, and angiography in 6. ERCP and PTC were the only methods which exactly showed the extent of the cysts and the anomalous pancreatico-biliary junction present in 5 patients. ERCP and PTC were mandatory for surgical planning and treatment. Pancreas divisum was revealed in 3 patients, all of whom had suffered from acute pancreatitis. Intracystic adenocarcinoma was depicted at cholangiography in 2 patients. US and CT were valuable in showing cystic masses between the pancreatic head and the hilum of the liver, but in no patient was the diagnosis made by any of these methods. Angiography was performed for preoperative vascular mapping.
