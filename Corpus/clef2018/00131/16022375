Malaria screening in blood donors in Cali, Colombia. In Colombia, blood units for transfusions are in short supply. In Cali, a city in central western Colombia, the situation is exacerbated by a policy of scrupulous rejection of blood donors who may have been exposed to malaria infection. Cali is free of malaria transmission, but it lies close to the Pacific Coast, a highly endemic region. Currently, malaria screening in potential blood donors is based only on an interview. A more sensitive and objective malaria test will increase the number of acceptable donors and, hence, increase the available blood supply.Three malaria tests were evaluated, thick smear, ELISA-IgG and ELISA-HRPII, using a semi-nested PCR as gold standard.The study was undertaken in a blood bank of Cali, from February to May 2002, where 286 individuals were examined. Blood thick smear, ELISA-IgG and ELISA-HRPII (Pan Malaria Antibody ELISA and Malaria Ag CELISA) results were compared to semi-nested PCR data.Of the 286 donors tested, 115 were rejected because of a history of traveling or living in a malaria endemic area within the last year. However, none of these applicants were malaria-positive using the three testing methods.To improve the screening process, laboratory tests for malaria are recommended for donors who are exposed to a risk of malaria infection. Additional studies are necessary for selection of most sensitive test, however.
