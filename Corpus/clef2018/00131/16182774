Outcome of 118 pancreas transplants with retroperitoneal portal-enteric drainage. We have recently described a technique for retroperitoneal pancreas transplantation (RPTx) with portal-enteric drainage (PED). Further experience with 118 RPTx is detailed herein.Between April 2001 and August 2004, 118 patients underwent RPTx with PED among 125 recipients (94.4%) scheduled for this procedure. Surgical complications and patient and graft survivals were recorded prospectively.After a minimum follow-up period of 3 months (mean 27.8 +/- 13.0 months), 18 recipients (15.2%) required relaparotomy because of bleeding (n = 6 5.1%), allograft pancreatectomy due to either hyperacute/accelerated rejection (n = 3We conclude that RPTx with PED is a technical option that may be included in the repertoire of pancreas transplant surgeons.
