Use of molecular beacon probes for real-time PCR detection of Plasmodium falciparum and other plasmodium species in peripheral blood specimens. We describe the development and evaluation of a novel pair of real-time, fluorescence-based PCR assays using molecular beacon probes for rapid, sensitive, and specific detection and quantification of Plasmodium falciparum and other Plasmodium species organisms.
