Usefulness of the "OptiMAL Rapid Malaria test" for rapid detection of malaria imported to Poland. In this survey the use of OptiMAL test for rapid diagnosis of malaria was evaluated. It was proved that this test allowed to diagnose the Plasmodium sp. antigen in 72% of examined blood specimens, 82% for P. falciparum infection and 69% for P. vivax, whereas P. ovale was not detected at all. The test sensitivity depended on the parasitemia level. It showed a sensitivity of 100% for parasitemia density exceeded 1%, 95.4% with the parasitemia ranging from 0.1-0.99%. For lower parasite density, the test's sensitivity was of 32 and 60%. The OptiMAL test showed a 99.1% specificity thus it revealed to be significantly high.
