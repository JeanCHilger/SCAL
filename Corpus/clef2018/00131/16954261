Development of a PCR assay followed by nonradioactive hybridization using oligonucleotides covalently bound to CovaLink NH microwells for detection of four Plasmodium species in blood samples from humans. We developed and evaluated a PCR-based assay to detect four Plasmodium species in 79 blood samples from 56 travelers returning from areas where malaria is endemic. DNA amplification targeting a small region of the 18S rRNA gene was performed with Plasmodium genus-specific primers. The biotinylated PCR products were then identified by PCR-colorimetric Covalink NH microwell plate hybridization (CMPH) using species-specific phosphorylated probes covalently bound to a pretreated polystyrene surface. The results from PCR-CMPH showed high specificity, and for 47 of the 56 patients (84%), microscopy and PCR-CMPH results were in agreement. Discordant results were reevaluated with microscopy examination, other molecular methods, and DNA sequencing. Except for one patient, discrepancies were resolved in favor of PCR-CMPH: three mixed infections were detected, four species identification errors were corrected, and two negative results were shown to be positive. Our results indicate that PCR-CMPH is a simple, rapid, and specific method for malaria diagnosis. It employs stable reagents and inexpensive equipment, making it suitable for routine epidemiological use.
