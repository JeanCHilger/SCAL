Evaluation of malaria endemicity by peptide ELISA. Interest in mapping the malaria transmission has motivated a need to develop a simple serological assay in a defined population. Evaluation of coded samples by peptide ELISA provided a framework to estimate the malarial impact. Comparison of field data and ELISA OD values in different malariogenic areas shows how the disease has been more correctly interpreted. Here we provide an empirical approach to estimate Annual Parasite Index (API) as well as Equivalent Transmission Index (ETI) using a combination of epidemiological, parasitological and immunological data. We estimate that there were 3 different malariogenic status like low, moderate and high transmission zones based on their' ELISA OD values. Our indigenous developed ETI estimates are 10 fold higher than API reported by the Primary Health Centre. Our record indicates that incidences of malaria will continue to be underestimated unless we adapt an alternative strategy. In order to verify the scope of malaria surveillance, coded samples were tested. Comparison of ELISA OD, API and ETI of the coded samples indicated Rourkela had high, Shahjahanpur had moderate and Bangalore had the lowest malaria transmission. For mass blood slide examination, microscopic method is a tedious process prone to human error while largely automated ELISA could reduce the scope for human error and could be a supplement for microscopic process.
