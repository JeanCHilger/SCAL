Plasmodium falciparum: immunization with MSP1-42 induced non-inhibitory antibodies that have no blocking activities but enhanced the potency of inhibitory anti-MSP1-42 antibodies. Hyperimmunization with Plasmodium falciparum MSP1-42 could induce antibodies that have little or no parasite growth inhibitory activities. These antisera had no blocking activities as determined by their ability to interfere with the in vitro activities of growth inhibitory anti-MSP1-42 sera. Equally important, they enhanced the potency of growth inhibitory anti-MSP1-42 sera.
