Diagnosis and treatment of small intestinal bleeding: retrospective analysis of 76 cases. To investigate the causes of small intestinal bleeding as well as its diagnosis and therapeutic approaches.A retrospective analysis was conducted according to the clinical records of 76 patients with small intestinal bleeding admitted to our hospital in the past 5 years.In these patients, tumor was the most frequent cause of small intestinal bleeding (37/76), followed by Mecke's diverticulum (21/76), angiopathy (15/76) and ectopic pancreas (3/76). Of the 76 patients, 21 were diagnosed by digital subtraction angiography, 13 by barium and air double contrast X-ray examination of the small intestine, 11 by 99mTc-sestamibi scintigraphy of the abdominal cavity, 6 by enteroscopy of the small intestine, 21 by laparoscopic laparotomy, and 4 by exploratory laparotomy. Although all the patients received surgical treatment, most of them (68/76) received part enterectomy covering the diseased segment and enteroanastomosis. The follow-up time ranged from 1 year to 5 years. No case had recurrent alimentary tract bleeding or other complications.Tumor is the major cause of small intestinal bleeding followed by Meckel's diverticulum and angiopathy. The main approaches to definite diagnosis of small intestinal bleeding include digital subtraction angiography, 99mTc-sestamibi scintigraphy of the abdominal cavity, barium and air double contrast X-ray examination of the small intestine, laparoscopic laparotomy or exploratory laparotomy. Part enterectomy covering the diseased segment and enteroanastomosis are the most effective treatment modalities for small intestinal bleeding.
