Hormone-producing serous cystadenoma of the pancreas. The clinical and histochemical examination of hormone-producing serous cystadenomas of the pancreas are presented. The study material was obtained from five female patients. The patients underwent diagnostic examinations, including ultrasonography, computer tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Doppler ultrasonography examination of abdomen. In all cases the presence of serous cystadenoma of pancreas was detected in the histopathologically verified sections. The test applied to immunohistochemically localize paraffin-embedded sections of neoplastic tissues of the pancreas was the LSAB2-HRP test using monoclonal antibodies against epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), synaptophysin, p53 and polyclonal antibodies against insulin, glucagon, somatostatin and pancreatic polypeptide. In one patient, ultrasonography revealed an irregular space filled with fluid resembling a multicellular cystic lesion. The Doppler ultrasonography examination showed a pathologically vascularized focus in the pancreatic head. In the adenoma sections of this patient, the immunohistochemical techniques revealed a strong positive somatostatin, pancreatic polypeptide and synaptophysin expression in the lining epithelium of neoplastic cysts.
