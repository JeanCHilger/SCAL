Epitopes of the human malaria parasite P. falciparum carried on the surface of HBsAg particles elicit an immune response against the parasite. The development of recombinant subunit vaccines against pathogenic organisms requires not only the identification of epitopes eliciting a protective immune response but also suitable carriers with adjuvant function. B- and T-cell epitopes of the malaria vaccine candidate gp190 were selected on the basis of a systematic search along the gp190 molecule and by computer prediction based on the amino acid sequence. Using some of the epitopes identified, we have redesigned the surface of the hepatitis B surface antigen lipoprotein particles by replacing the major antigenic determinants with malaria-specific sequences of up to 61 amino acids in length. Upon expression via vaccinia virus the hybrid particles elicit an anti-gp190 immune response in animals. Monoclonal antibodies derived from such infections recognize the native parasite.
