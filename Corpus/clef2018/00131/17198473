Solid pseudopapillary tumors of the pancreas: diagnosis and curative treatment. To highlight an infrequent occurrence using a series of clinical cases with symptoms and signs, and specific radiological findings allowing its diagnosis and treatment, which is in most cases successful.A descriptive and retrospective study of patients diagnosed by computed tomography scanning and then treated with surgery in the Pancreas and Biliary Unit of a University Hospital from March 1999 to September 2005.There were 6 female patients with a mean age of 33.5 years (range 11-72). Most common signs included pain and a palpable mass in the abdomen. Three patients were diagnosed by computed tomography scanning, and a differential diagnosis with a neuroendocrine tumor was performed for the remaining three subjects. Surgical treatment was adapted to each patient according to the findings and images seen in their computed tomography scans. Biopsy results confirmed the presumed diagnoses, and showed one case of solid pseudopapillary carcinoma of the pancreas. Average hospital stay was of 18.16 days (range 8-30). Mortality rate was 0%. No recurrences occurred during follow-up for 46.3 months on average (range 12-76).The presence of a huge mass in the pancreas of a young female should prompt suspicion for a solid pseudopapillary tumor. Given its low malignant potential, and the presence of specific radiographic patterns, its diagnosis should be accurate, as radical surgical treatment is effective.
