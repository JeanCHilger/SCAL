Effects of ABO/Rh blood groups, G-6-P-D enzyme activity and haemoglobin genotypes on malaria parasitaemia and parasite density. The main objective was to investigate the effects of ABO/Rh blood groups, haemoglobin genotype and G-6-P-D enzyme activity on malaria. The study was carried out in Buea, South West Province, Cameroon. Subjects consulting at health care facilities in Buea were randomly recruited into the study. A total of 121 febrile patients 1-60 years old comprised the study subjects. Thin and thick blood films were prepared for malaria parasite detection. G-6-P-D enzyme activity was assayed using the met-haemoglobin reduction test. Determination of haemoglobin genotypes was by a rapid screening method alongside electrophoresis. Malaria positive patients were treated. The highest malaria prevalence of 74.5 % was in Group O individuals and the lowest of 58.6% in group B individuals. Mean parasite density (Log(10)(-1)/ul blood) in the various blood groups was not significantly different. Individuals with G-6-P-D deficiency had a significantly lower malaria prevalence (47.5%) when compared with active individuals. Mean parasite density in enzyme deficient and active individuals was 3.7(SD+/- 3.9) and 4.4(SD +/-5.0) respectively and the difference was significant (p < 0.05). Malaria prevalence was lower (57.5%) in HbS individuals when compared with HbAA (74.6%) and HbSS (60%) but parasite density was not significantly different. Our results suggest that individuals with blood group O who have the HbAA genotype and show G-6-P-D enzyme activity may be more susceptible to malaria. Information on the influence of these genetic factors on malaria would be useful in the better management of the disease in the study area.
