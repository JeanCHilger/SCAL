Recurrent hypoglycaemia in HIV-positive narcotic addicts. We describe two narcotic addict women with recurrent hypoglycaemic episodes. In both patients, hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia occurring in the fasting state was documented and computed tomography of the pancreas was normal.In patient 1, selective arterial calcium stimulation with hepatic venous sampling (ASVS) revealed pronounced insulin hypersecretion predominantly in the tail and, to a lesser extent, in the corpus and the head of the pancreas. On laparoscopic exploration, tumours could not be detected be it grossly or by intraoperative ultrasound. Distal pancreatectomy was performed laparoscopically, and histological examination of the resected tissue revealed nesidioblastosis. ASVS was also performed in patient 2 revealing less marked increases in insulin secretion, ie up to 2.3-fold in response to calcium stimulation of the superior mesenteric artery, consistent with the presence of pathological beta-cells located predominantly in the head of the pancreas. Surgical exploration was not performed in this patient.HIV infection had been known in both women for around ten years and both patients were not on antiretroviral therapy. Because symptomatic nesidioblastosis in adult patients is a very rare disorder, we speculate that nesidioblastosis may develop in the context of HIV infection and/or abuse of narcotic drugs. Our observations illustrate that neurocognitive impairment in HIV positive patients is not always due to toxic compounds or a cerebral disorder but may be caused by an apparently rare pancreatic disorder, nesidioblastosis. Thus, the patients should be checked for the presence of hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia.
