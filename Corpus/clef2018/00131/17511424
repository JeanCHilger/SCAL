Detection of malaria infection via latex agglutination assay. A rapid test for malaria diagnosis based on specific agglutination of sensitive polystyrene particles containing carboxylic acid with antigen or antibody molecules in the presence of their corresponding antibody or antigen in human plasma has been achieved. The particle-malaria antigen conjugate (PAgC), particle-monoclonal IgG antibody to Plasmodium falciparum heat shock protein 70 conjugate (PmAbC), and particle-polyclonal IgG antibody to P. falciparum malaria conjugate (PpAbC) were prepared via adsorption process. The higher affinity of the malaria antigen adsorption onto particles was observed compared to that of the antibodies. Immunoagglutination of sensitive latex particles was monitored by measuring the change in turbidity, and the aggregate's formation was clearly observed under optical microscope. The efficacy in malaria diagnosis of the conjugated particles evaluated at an outpatient malaria clinic (Mae Sod, Thailand) indicated a success detection of antibody or antigen. Sensitivity of PAgC, PmAbC, and PpAbC for P. falciparum was 84%, 90%, and 90%, respectively, while specificity for malaria disease was 70% for PAgC and 80% for PmAbC and PpAbC. The rapid agglutination-based latex particles assay developed herein showed a great potential for diagnosis of malaria infection.
