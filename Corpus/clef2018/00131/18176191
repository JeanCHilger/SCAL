A case with mature B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and pancreatic involvement at the time of diagnosis. Pancreatic infiltration with leukemic cells is a rare manifestation of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. There are only a few reported cases. We report the clinical and radiologic findings of a 4-year-old boy with mature B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and pancreatic involvement. A computed tomography scan of his abdomen demonstrated diffuse hypodense lesions in the pancreas. Plasma amylase and lipase levels at that time were high, but no signs of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia were observed. After 2 cycles of chemotherapy, the lesions in his pancreas, liver, and kidney disappeared, and his pancreatitis resolved as well. At 11 months' follow-up, after completion of therapy, the patient continues to be in remission.
