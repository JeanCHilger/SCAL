Dual-phase CT of autoimmune pancreatitis: a multireader study. The purpose of this study was to identify findings that aid in differentiating autoimmune pancreatitis from pancreatic carcinoma using dual-phase CT.Dual-phase CT scans of 74 patients (25 with autoimmune pancreatitis, 33 with pancreatic carcinoma, and 16 with a normal pancreas) were independently evaluated by three radiologists for enhancement of the pancreas the presence of a capsule-like rim, peripancreatic strands, and pancreatic calcificationsDiffusely decreased enhancement of the pancreas (autoimmune pancreatitis vs carcinoma: 28% vs 3% p = 0.02, kappa = 0.33-0.75), capsule-like rim (40% vs 9%Diffusely decreased enhancement of the pancreas, a capsule-like rim, bile duct enhancement, and renal involvement are useful signs of autoimmune pancreatitis.
