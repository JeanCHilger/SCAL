DNA diagnosis of falciparum malaria. We have developed DNA diagnosis using Universal probe system for the rapid detection of Plasmodium falciparum parasite in blood. We chose the DHFR-TS (dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase) gene as target for detection which are the junction part (410 bp) of and the DHFR part (790 bp). In the parasite, there is only one copy of target sequence, therefore, the target sequences were amplified by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) to increase the sensitivity. Our hybridization method consists of two probes a primary probe prepared from a chimeric phage-plasmid vector (pUCf1) containing sequence complementary to the target, and a biotin-labeled secondary probe complementary to a portion of the primary probe, which is detected by the BCIP/NBT method. We showed that the 410 bp was more sensitive than the 790 bp as a target of P. falciparum, and the limit of detection was 10(3) parasites in 1 ml human blood using 410 bp junction part. We also constructed double PCR systems using junction part of DHFR-TS gene. By amplification of the 410 bp of the junction part and reamplification of 228 bp of inside sequence of the 410 bp, as little as 10 parasites in 10 microliters human blood was sufficient for specific detection.
