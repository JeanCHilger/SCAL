Total prepyloric transection of stomach and vertebral trauma: case report and review of the literature. A rare injury of stomach associated with vertebral trauma in a 10-year-old girl, a victim of a traffic accident, is presented. Early X-ray and computerized tomography scan revealed no free abdominal air, only signs of pancreas contusion and fracture of the Th 12 and L 1 vertebral body were evident. Transection of stomach was revealed during endoscopy (an attempt to perform retrograde cholangio-pancreaticography) 20 h after the trauma. Primary suture of the rupture was performed. Sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome developed in the postoperative course. The girl subsequently underwent four laparotomies for abdominal infection, bleeding and colonic stricture. After resolution of the abdominal disorders the girl underwent surgical stabilization of spine. Currently, 2 years after trauma, she is doing well without any gastroenterologic dysfunction.
