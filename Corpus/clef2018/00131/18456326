Granulocytic sarcoma of Core-binding Factor (CBF) acute myeloid leukemia mimicking pancreatic cancer. Granulocytic sarcoma mimicking a synchronous second primary neoplasm (SPN) constitutes a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge particularly in elderly patients. We report on a 75-year-old female presenting with a Core-binding Factor (CBF) AML of M4eo subtype. The patient also had jaundice, highly elevated bilirubin, lipase, alkaline phosphatase (AP), CA 19-9, and a pancreatic mass highly suspicious of infiltrating pancreatic carcinoma. However, a biopsy demonstrated granulocytic sarcoma. Since the patient had no comorbidities and had been in excellent performance status until the diagnosis of AML, induction chemotherapy was initiated, with subsequent normalization of bilirubin, CA 19-9, lipase and AP. Complete hematologic remission of AML was attained and the pancreatic mass could not be detected anymore. Retrospective analysis of the c-kit protooncogene did not disclose activating mutations of exons 8 or 17. Following one consolidation treatment, the patient remained in excellent health until relapse occurred 7 months later and she succumbed to AML. In conclusion, AML can rarely mimic the clinical picture of pancreatic cancer. The initially good response of this CBF leukemia highlights the principal usefulness of aggressive induction chemotherapy also in older AML patients, if they are carefully selected not only according to biological risk factors such as cytogenetics, but also to "host factors" (good performance status, lack of comorbidities, etc.).
