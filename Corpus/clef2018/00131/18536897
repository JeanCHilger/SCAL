Endoscopic cystogastrostomy. Endoscopic cystoenterostomy for drainage of pancreatic pseudocyst is a new emerging modality which has rarely been reported in pediatric patients. Only ten successfully performed cases of pediatric endoscopic cystoenterostomy have been reported previously. We report a case of 9 year old male child with post traumatic pseudocyst of pancreas, successfully managed by endoscopic cystogastrostomy. To best of our knowledge, this is the first pediatric case report in Indian literature.
