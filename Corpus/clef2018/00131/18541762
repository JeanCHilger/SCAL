Malaria vectors in areas of Plasmodium falciparum epidemic transmission in the Amazon region, Brazil. The main vectors of malaria in Brazil are Anopheles darlingi, An. aquasalis, and some species of the An. albitarsis complex, whereas others have questionable importance with regard to the disease transmission. To identify these vectors in the State of Par√°, Brazil, in a high-prevalence P. falciparum area, 565 anophelines were captured and identified while the seasonal variation and daily biting activity were determined. Of the seven anopheline species (An. strodei, An. albitarsis s.l., An. rondoni, An. darlingi, An. triannulatus, An. oswaldoi, and An. nuneztovari), the plasmodia circumsporozoite protein (CSP) was detected in three of them, with a total infection rate of 6.2%. An. darlingi was the most prevalent species (22.4%), followed by An. albitarsis (5.2%) and An. rondoni (3.6%). An. rondoni was found to be infected for the first time, which was also confirmed through PCR. This result possibly represents a new malaria vector based on its highest frequency, biting and seasonal activities in the peak of malaria transmission.
