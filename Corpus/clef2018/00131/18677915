Ultrasound guided percutaneous drainage in the treatment of local septic complications of chronic pancreatitis. To evaluate results of ultrasound guided percutaneous catheter drainage (PCD) for local septic complications of chronic pancreatitis.Between 1999 and 2002, PCD was used in 19 patients with chronic pancreatitis for 6 infected acute pseudocysts, 3 post-necrotic abscesses, 3 abscesses following pancreatic resections, 6 abscesses with none of the precipitating factors present (no acute episode or recent surgical/endoscopic interventions) and a tuberculous peritoneal empyema. In 17 patients, collections were unilocular.Trocar technique was used in 14 patients and Seldinger technique in 5. Sixteen patients were successfully treated with PCD alone (mean drainage duration = 32 days) without abscess recurrence during the follow-up period (mean = 35.6 month). Surgical treatment was necessary in 3 patients. Pseudocyst recurrence occurred in another patient after 9 months.PCD should be considered as the initial therapy for chronic pancreatitis local septic complications. Surgery is reserved for patients in whom PCD fails.
