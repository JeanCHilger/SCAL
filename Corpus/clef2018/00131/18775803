Markers of vascular endothelial cell damage and P. falciparum malaria: association between levels of both sE-selectin and thrombomodulin, and cytokines, hemoglobin and clinical presentation. We investigated associations between markers of damage of vascular endothelial cells (MDVECs) and plasma cytokine levels, hemoglobin level and temperature in individuals with acute uncomplicated malaria, as well as healthy controls, using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the presence of soluble endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (sE-selectin), circulating granule membrane protein-140 (sP-selectin), circulating thrombomodulin (TM), circulating von Willebrand factor (VWf), interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). Significant differences were observed between falciparum malaria patients and the healthy people in term of levels of both sE-selectin and TM. The serum levels of sP-selectin and VWf were comparable between the two groups. The levels of both sE-Selectin and TM correlated positively with temperature, levels of IFN-gamma and levels of TNF-alpha and negatively with hemoglobin levels. Trends of positive correlations were observed between level of sP-selectin or VWf and temperature. Furthermore, sE-selectin levels correlated with vomiting. These data suggest that sE-selectin and TM might be useful markers of endothelium activation in in vivo studies. Moreover, our results highlight the use of both sE-selctin and TM as markers of anemia.
