Comments and illustrations regarding the guidelines and good clinical practice recommendations for contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)--update 2008. The recently published EFSUMB guidelines and recommendations provide general advice for the use of ultrasound contrast agents to improve the management of patients. They are the subject of this pictorial essay, comments and analysis of the literature. CEUS has become the most important imaging method for focal liver diseases. Its uses are discussed in detail, especially the characterization of liver tumors and the monitoring of local treatment. The recommendations also deal with the uses of ultrasound contrast agents for the evaluation of the microvasculature and macrovasculature of the kidneys, including the characterization of focal renal lesions, the detection of lesions and the monitoring of local treatment. CEUS and contrast-enhanced endoscopic ultrasound can be used to characterize lesions. Ductal adenocarcinoma as the most common tumor of the pancreas is typically hypoenhanced compared to the adjacent pancreatic tissue in all phases. Neuroendocrine tumors and serous microcystic adenoma of the pancreas are characterized by hypervascularization appearing typically hyperenhanced during CEUS. This is of importance for a differential diagnosis. Vesicoureteric reflux and blunt abdominal trauma are also mentioned. Other parts or chapters of the guidelines are described in a separate paper of this supplement.
