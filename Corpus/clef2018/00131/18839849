Detection of circulating antibody of Parastrongylus cantonensis in sera with eosinophilic meningitis by dot-blot ELISA. Eosinophilic meningitis caused by Parastrongylus cantonensis, the rat lung worm is a major public health problem in Thailand. Humans acquire this parasite by eating raw food containing infective Parastrongyliasis is dificult to make because identification of parasite materials by biopsy or chance finding is rarely possible.Develop alternative approaches of Parastrongylus cantonensis infection employing crude antigen by dot-blot ELISA.The investigation was carried out between October 2003 and July 2004 in Khon Kaen, which is an endemic area. One hundred thirty two serum samples from several villagers of the present study area were divided into five groups. Group 1 consisted of 30 patients with Cryptococcal meningitis, group 2 were 22 cases of Bacterial meningitis, group 3 were 32 cases of eosinophilic meningitis, group 4 were other parasitic infections (4 from Cysticercosis, 2 from Fascioliasis, 12 from Malaria), and group 5 were 30 negative healthy control.The result demonstrated that 26 cases of eosinophilic meningitis, were positive with Dot-blot ELISA (81.3%). None of the other groups of sample reacted with this antigen.The data obtained showed that Dot-blot ELISA has a potential for diagnosis of eosinophilic meningitis caused by Parastrongylus cantonensis.
