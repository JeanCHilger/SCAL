Evaluation of usefulness of the panel test composed of malaria non-specific tests as a surrogate marker. Although malaria-specific antibody or antigen test is useful for the diagnosis of malaria infection, its cost-effectiveness has to be concerned in the area where malaria prevalence is very low. We created a panel test composed of malaria non-specific parameters, namely hematology autoanalyzer-derived results with or without addition of HDL-cholesterol data, and evaluated its usefulness in comparison with malaria-specific antibody test.For 395 patients tested for malaria smear, the hematology parameters such as platelet count, NRBC (%) and VCS (volume, conductivity, scattering) parameters of WBC, and HDL-cholesterol data were analyzed. Statistical significance of each parameter and that of panel test with or without addition of HDL-cholesterol were evaluated.Malaria antibody test showed sensitivity of 97.1% and specificity of 99.1%. Each parameter of platelet count, NRBC (%), D parameter and HDL-cholesterol showed sensitivity of 86.8%, 41.2%, 81.8%, and 70.6%, and specificity of 85.9%, 96.3%, 72.3%, and 81.7%, respectively. Panel test without including HDL-cholesterol showed sensitivity of 91.2% and specificity of 81.6%, and that including HDL-cholesterol showed sensitivity of 91.2% and specificity of 86.2%.The malaria non-specific panel test composed of hematology autoanalyzer-derived parameters showed relatively good, but slightly lower sensitivity than that of malaria-specific antibody test. It might be used as a screening test for the diagnosis of malaria infection, and addition of HDL cholesterol improved little the usefulness of the panel test.
