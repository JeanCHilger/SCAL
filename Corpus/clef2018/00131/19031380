Head CT in patient with metabolic acidosis. An unresponsive 30-year-old female with a history of anxiety and chronic alcohol abuse presented to an emergency department with altered mental status and a severe metabolic acidosis. The patient was intubated for airway protection, and she empirically received folic acid, bicarbonate, and 5% ethanol continuous infusion for suspected ingestion of toxic alcohol. Following transfer to our institution, the patient was minimally responsive to noxious stimuli. She received fomepizole at dosing corrected for hemodialysis(HD), and bicarbonate via multiple boluses and continuous infusion. The ethanol drip was stopped. The nephrology service had been alerted to this patient's arrival and condition hemodialysis via a standard heparinized circuit was initiated immediately after her arrival, which produced a marked improvement in the patient's acid-base status. Her serum methanol concentration subsequently returned at > 200 mg/dL. After 12 hours and 2 sessions of hemodialysis, the patient remained unresponsive despite minimal sedation. Anisocoria was noted on exam. Computed tomography of the brain demonstrated a large hematoma in the left basal ganglia that extended into the left frontal and parietal white matter accompanied by intraventricular extension, midline shift, loss of grey-white differentiation throughout, suggesting tonsillar herniation (Figure 1). Forty-eight hours after presentation, radionuclide imaging of the brain revealed no intracranial blood flow
