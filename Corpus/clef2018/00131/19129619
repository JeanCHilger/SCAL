Isolated tuberculosis of the pancreas: a case report. Pancreatic tuberculosis is a rare entity. Only a few cases have been reported in the medical literature. We hereby describe a case of pancreatic tuberculosis in an immunocompromized individual.A fifty-year-old African-American gentleman with history of HIV non-compliant on anti-retroviral therapy presented with epigastric pain for five weeks duration. CT scan of abdomen showed large necrotic node on the posterior aspect of the head of pancreas and multiple cystic masses adjacent to the pancreas. Acid fast bacilli were found on staining of CT guided biopsy of the node. Cultures grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Anti-tubercular therapy was initiated and resulted in gradual resolution of symptoms.Pancreatic tuberculosis is rare and is frequently confused with pancreatic cancer on clinical presentation as well as on imaging studies. Since it is a curable disease, accurate diagnosis is paramount CT or ultrasound guided biopsy is cornerstone of diagnosis. Endoscopic ultrasound is now increasingly being used for obtaining tissue for diagnosis. Anti-tubercular therapy is curative in majority of the cases.
