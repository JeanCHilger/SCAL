A case of solitary fibrous tumor of the pancreas. A 58-year-old woman without any clinical symptoms had a routine health check-up, during which a mass in the head of the pancreas was detected by US. Abdominal US showed a round, hypoechogenic nodule of the pancreatic head. The tumor measured 3cm in diameter and contained an anechoic area. CT revealed a well-demarcated tumor in the pancreatic head. The tumor was partially enhanced by contrast medium, but the left portion of the tumor, which US had shown to be an anechoic area was not enhanced. Imaging findings suggested an endocrine tumor with cystic changes. A pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy was performed. The tumor was composed of spindle-shaped cells. There was a typical patternless growth of short fascicles and a short storiform arrangement of cells in the stroma with varying degrees of collagenization. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for CD34 and Bcl-2. Based on the light microscopic morphology and immunostaining profile, the tumor was classified as a solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) of the pancreas.
