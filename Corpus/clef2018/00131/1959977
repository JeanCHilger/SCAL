Detection of antidrug IgG antibodies in patients with adverse drug reactions to amodiaquine. Antidrug IgG antibodies have been detected in some patients receiving amodiaquine (AQ). Antidrug antibodies were detected in 6/7 patients who experienced serious well-defined adverse drug reactions during malaria prophylaxis and in 7/22 patients who received comparable doses of the drug (at least 400 mg weekly x 6) but did not present with clinical adverse drug reactions. In contrast antidrug antibodies were not detected in 7 patients who received the drug for treatment (1.0-1.2 g total over 3 days). The specificity of the IgG response was defined by hapten inhibition experiments (IC50 value for AQ ranged between 0.050 and 0.282 microM) which suggest that the antibody recognised the drug linked to cysteine residues in protein via the 4-hydroxyanilino side chain. The data show that AQ is immunogenic in man and are consistent with the hypothesis that idiosyncratic adverse reactions to the drug have an immunological aetiology.
