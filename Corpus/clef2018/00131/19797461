Autoimmune pancreatitis: a mimic of pancreatic cancer. Autoimmune pancreatitis is an idiopathic inflammatory disease that produces pancreatic masses and ductal strictures. This benign disease resembles pancreatic carcinoma both clinically and radiographically. The diagnosis of autoimmune pancreatitis is challenging to make. However, accurate and timely diagnosis may preempt the misdiagnosis of cancer and decrease the number of unnecessary pancreatic resections.
