Microcystic serous pancreatic cystadenoma. The pancreatic cystic serous neoplasms are divided into two categories: benign serous cystadenoma (SCA) and malignant serous cystadenocarcinoma. Furthermore, based on the macroscopic appearances, SCAs are subdivided into serous microcystic adenomas (SMAs) and serous oligocystic or macrocystic adenomas.Report of a new case of SMA in which we emphasize on the diagnostic difficulties encountered against such tumor despite its relatively radiological easiness compared to the other variants.We report the case of 84 year-old-woman with a microcystic serous cystadenoma of the pancreas which was identified on pathologic examination of the surgical specimen, after unconclusive abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography (CT)- scan.This case describes this rare entity and emphasizes that the diagnosis of such entity is still based on pathological examination after tumor removal.
