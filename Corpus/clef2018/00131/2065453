Fusion protein Dot-ELISA for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum antibodies. The feasibility of using fusion protein Dot-ELISA to detect the antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum was presented. Fusion protein expressed in the P. falciparum genomic DNA expression library with lambda gt11 was used as the antigen to coat the solid support nitrocellulose strips. Horseradish peroxidase conjugated with goat antihuman IgG was used as the second antibody. The enzyme activity was read by naked eyes according to the dot colour. The results by Dot-ELISA correlated well with those by IFA. The study indicated that this method was specific, sensitive, simple, and replicable. It would be valuable for further studying the usefulness of fusion protein in the immunodiagnosis of malaria.
