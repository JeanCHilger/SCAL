Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration with liquid-based cytologic preparation in the diagnosis of primary pancreatic lymphoma. The diagnosis subtyping of lymphoma on specimens collected by endoscopic ultrasound fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) can be extremely difficult. When a cytopathologist is available for the on-site evaluation, the diagnosis may be achieved by applying flow cytometric techniques. We describe our experience with immunocytochemistry (ICC) and molecular biology studies applied on EUS-FNA specimens processed with a liquid-based cytologic (LBC) preparation for the diagnosis of primary pancreatic lymphoma (PPL).Three patients with a pancreatic mass underwent EUS-FNA. The collected specimens were processed with the ThinPrep method for the cytologic diagnosis and eventual additional investigations.A morphologic picture consistent with PPL was found on the LBC specimens of the 3 patients. Subsequent ICC and molecular biology studies for immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement established the diagnosis of pancreatic large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 2 patients and a non-Hodgkin lymphoma with plasmoblastic/immunoblastic differentiation in the remaining one.An LBC preparation can be used to diagnose and subtype PPL by applying ICC and molecular biology techniques to specimens collected with EUS-FNA. This method can be an additional processing method for EUS-FNA specimens in centers where on-site cytopathologist expertise is not available.
