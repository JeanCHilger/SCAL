Positron emission tomography/computed tomography diagnostics by means of fluorine-18-L-dihydroxyphenylalanine in congenital hyperinsulinism. The unfavorable prognosis of congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) can be avoided if the patients are treated with high-dose glucose infusions and timely surgical intervention. Circumscribed foci used to be identified by selective percutaneous pancreatic vein catheterization and determination of the insulin level. Fluorine-18-L-dihydroxyphenylalanine-positron emission tomography (PET) was developed as a milder alternative for diagnostic localization of focal disease. The uptake of fluorine-18-L-dihydroxyphenylalanine is considerably increased in foci with high insulin synthesis rates. In Berlin, diagnosis was achieved by high definition PET/computed tomography with multiphase contrast media protocols that provided all necessary data with one investigation. We have investigated 135 patients with congenital hyperinsulinism, including 45 patients with focal disease (33.3%). All the foci were excised on the basis of PET/computed tomography images. The German data demonstrate that 87% to 91% of the operated patients could be completely healed.
