Comparison of three different injection methods for arterial phase of Gd-EOB-DTPA enhanced MR imaging of the liver. To compare three different injection methods for optimizing hepatic arterial phase of gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA) enhanced MR imaging.Arterial phase images were obtained after the injection of contrast agent at a rate of 3 mL/s with diluted Gd-EOB-DTPA (dilution method) in 27 patients, 3 mL/s with undiluted Gd-EOB-DTPA (3 mL method) in 26 patients and 1 mL/s with undiluted Gd-EOB-DTPA (1 mL method) in 28 patients. In the quantitative evaluation, signal-to-phantom ratios (SPR) of the liver parenchyma, pancreas, renal cortex, portal vein and aorta were evaluated. In the qualitative evaluation, the seven items for image quality of hepatic arterial phase were assessed, and the total score of all items in each subject was calculated.The score of enhancement of abdominal aorta and total score of seven items in 1 mL method were significantly higher than those in 3 mL method. The SPR of the liver parenchyma in 3 mL method was significantly higher than that in 1 mL method, suggesting substantial hepatic inflow from portal venous return.For the optimal arterial phase imaging, injection rate of 1 mL/s with undiluted Gd-EOB-DTPA is convenient and preferable, compared with other two methods, based on our qualitative analysis.
