The Quantitative Buffy Coat test (Q.B.C. test). Monofluo Kit Falciparum. Comparative value in the rapid diagnosis of malaria. New emerging atypical forms of malaria, characterized by weak parasitemia, among peoples without premunition, back from Plasmodium falciparum resistant areas, make it necessary to use rapid, sensitive, reliable methods of parasitologic diagnosis. This work concerned two different populations: 394 expatriates back from a 4 months stage in endemic areas. 12 patients admitted for suspected of proved malaria. Authors have studied, by double blind method, versus thin film, two fluorescent techniques: a direct immunofluorescence, the Monofluo kit Falciparum of Diagnostic Pasteur. A nucleic acid fluorescence, on blood samples centrifuged in capillary tubes, the Q.B.C. test of Becton-Dickinson. Both methods seem of great interest for epidemiological surveys. The Q.B.C. test has showed more sensitivity than the thin film: it's rapidity of realisation indicates it for urgent diagnosis.
