Pancreatic tumors: emphasis on CT findings and pathologic classification. Pancreatic tumors can be classified by their morphologic features on CT. The subtypes include solid tumors, mixed cystic and solid lesions, unilocular cysts, multilocular cystic lesions, and microcystic lesions. Endoscopic US and MRI can provide detailed information for classifying pancreatic lesions. Each subtype has different kinds of tumors and malignant potential, thus the classification can be useful for a better differential diagnosis and treatment planning. For this purpose, we suggest an appropriate modified classification system by using the imaging features of pancreatic tumors with an emphasis on CT findings and illustrate various findings of typical and atypical manifestations.
