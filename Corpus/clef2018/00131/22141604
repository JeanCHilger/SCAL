Multi-detector CT/CT angiogram assessment of acute pancreatic graft dysfunction. Simultaneous pancreatic-kidney transplantation is the definitive treatment for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and renal failure. Pancreatic graft failure is an important postoperative complication and most commonly occurs as a result of pancreatitis, graft thrombosis or rejection. Distinguishing between these causes is necessary to determine timely, appropriate management and thereby potentially minimising graft loss. Multi-detector CT imaging may be used to identify the cause of pancreatic graft dysfunction when renal function is not markedly impaired.
