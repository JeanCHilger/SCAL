Renal carcinoma metachronous metastases to the gall-bladder and pancreas--case report. Renal carcinoma metastases to the gastrointestinal tract are seldom reported in medical literature. The study presented a case of a 76-year old female patient who underwent nephrectomy, due to T2N0M0 clear cell renal carcinoma and was additionally diagnosed with two metachronous metastases to the gall-bladder and pancreas. Abdominal ultrasound performed 32 months after nephrectomy demonstrated the presence of cholelithiasis and gall-bladder polyp. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed. Clear cell renal carcinoma metastasis restricted to the gall-bladder mucosa was diagnosed on the basis of the histopathological examination. After surgery the patient remained under follow-up. In December, 2009 (47 months after nephrectomy) abdominal computer tomography (CT) revealed the presence of a tumor located in the tail of the pancreas. Distal pancreatic resection and splenectomy was performed. The histopathological examination confirmed the presence of clear cell renal carcinoma metastasis. The patient is in good general condition, under follow-up at the Oncological Outpatient Clinic.
