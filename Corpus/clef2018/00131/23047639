A case of pancreatic mucinous carcinoma invading the common bile duct with obstructive jaundice. A 75-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for further investigation of obstructive jaundice due to a mucin-producing bile duct tumor. ERCP revealed dilatation of the common bile duct and a filling defect in the bile duct. Because of obstructive jaundice, an EBD tube was placed and bile was drained. Contrast-enhanced CT showed a low density 2-cm mass, in the pancreatic head containing some enhanced parts in the tumor. MRI revealed the tumor to be a low-intensity mass on T2-weighted image. After recovery from the obstructive jaundice, pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed under a diagnosis of invasive mucinous carcinoma penetrating the common bile duct from the pancreatic head, resulting in obstruction of the common bile duct. Postoperatively histopathological diagnosis of the resected specimen showed mainly mucinous carcinoma originating from the pancreatic head without a component of intraductal papillary-mucinous tumor.
