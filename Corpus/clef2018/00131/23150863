Cystic lesions of the pancreas: radiologic-endosonographic correlation. Cystic lesions of the pancreas are relatively common findings at cross-sectional imaging however, classification of these lesions on the basis of imaging features alone can sometimes be difficult. Complementary evaluation with endoscopic ultrasonography and fine-needle aspiration may be helpful in the diagnosis of these lesions. Cystic lesions of the pancreas may range from benign to malignant and include both primary cystic lesions of the pancreas (including intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, mucinous cystic neoplasms, serous cystadenomas, pseudocysts, and true epithelial cysts) and solid neoplasms undergoing cystic degeneration (including neuroendocrine tumors, solid pseudopapillary neoplasms, and, rarely, adenocarcinoma and its variants). Familiarity with the imaging features of these lesions and the basic treatment algorithms is essential for radiologists, as collaboration with gastroenterologists and surgeons is often necessary to obtain an early and accurate diagnosis.
