HIV-related/AIDS cholangiopathy: pictorial review with emphasis on MRCP findings and differential diagnosis. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography provides accurate, noninvasive diagnosis of HIV/AIDS cholangiopathy through the identification of characteristic ductal abnormalities including multiple intrahepatic strictures, papillary stenosis, and long segmental extrahepatic strictures. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography should be reserved for cytological or bioptic investigation in doubtful cases and for operative treatment when appropriate. Furthermore, cross-sectional imaging allows differentiation from other causes of biliary dilatation in HIV-positive patients, including infectious (bacterial) cholangitis, portal biliopathy, pancreatic or duodenal lymphoma, and mycobacterial lymphadenopathies.
