Laparoscopic excision of a retroperitoneal ganglioneuroma. Ganglioneuromas are rare benign tumors originating from ganglion cells. Ganglioneuromas are detected incidentally because they are asymptomatic. We report a case of laparoscopic excision of a retroperitoneal ganglioneuroma.A 49-y-old female was admitted to our medical center with the complaint of abdominal pain. Abdominal ultrasound showed a hypoechoic solid lesion at the level of the liver hilum, adjacent to the pancreas. Computerized tomography scan confirmed the presence of a thin walled mass 44 mm in diameter, adjacent to the pancreas and liver. Laparoscopic excision of the retroperitoneal mass was planned. The tumor was removed en bloc, and the pathologic diagnosis was ganglioneuroma. The patient was discharged from the hospital on the third postoperative day without any complications.Minimally invasive surgery has been shown to be safe and reliable in patients with retroperitoneal tumors.
