Laparoscopic drainage of a large pancreatic pseudocyst. Laparoscopic cystogastrostomy is an established procedure for the drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts. Cysts are mainly present in the lesser sac (retro-gastric), which is completely amenable to cystogastrostomy. We discuss the problems faced and simple solutions to the problems in managing a huge pancreatic pseudocyst of 22 cm√ó18 cm in a young boy 18 y of age.
