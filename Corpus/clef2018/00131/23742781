Pancreatic Castleman disease treated with laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy. Castleman disease is an uncommon lymphoproliferative disorder most frequently occurring in the mediastinum. Abdominal forms are less frequent, with pancreatic localization of the disease in particular being extremely rare. Only seventeen cases have been described in the world literature.This report describes an interesting and unusual case of pancreatic Castleman disease treated with laparoscopic resection.A 48-year-old woman presented with epigastric pain. CT scan showed a well-encapsulated mass on the ventral border of the pancreas. Endosonography with fine needle aspiration biopsy was performed. Biopsy showed lymphoid elements and structures of a normal lymph node. The patient was treated with laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy. The pancreas was transected with a Ligasure device and the pancreatic stump was secured with a manual suture. One year after surgery the patient was complaint-free and showed no signs of recurrence of the disease.Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy is a feasible and safe method for the treatment of lesions in the body and tail of the pancreas. Transection of the pancreas with a Ligasure device offers the advantages of low bleeding and low risk of pancreatic fistula.
