Endoscopic sonography and sonographically guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy in the diagnosis of unusual pancreatic metastases from synovial sarcoma. Pancreatic metastases are commonly solitary solid lesions frequently derived from primary renal cell carcinoma, lung cancer, or melanoma. Very few case reports have described cystic-appearing metastases in the pancreas and even fewer have reported a combination of cystic and solid metastatic lesions. Synovial sarcoma is a rare and aggressive soft tissue neoplasm, frequently metastasizing to the lungs and bones. We present a case of primary synovial sarcoma with multiple solid and cystic-appearing pancreatic metastases diagnosed by endoscopic ultrasound and sonographically guided fine-needle aspiration.
