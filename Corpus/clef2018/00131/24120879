Current role and future potential of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography with an emphasis on incidental findings. Aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of relevant biliary and extrabiliary findings in patients undergoing magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP).Three hundred eighty-four patients underwent 1.5-Tesla MRCP, and relevant biliary and extra-biliary findings were identified.Four hundred twenty-two biliary findings were identified in 384 patients (75% 1.1 per patient). Ninety-five patients were free of any relevant biliary finding (25%). Incidental extrabiliary findings were observed in 763 patients (1.98/patient).Most of the findings can be diagnosed by MRCP, while others require further examination. Interdisciplinary involvement is recommended to optimize clinical categorization, management, and treatment of these incidental findings.
