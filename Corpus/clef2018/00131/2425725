Augmented antibody response to live attenuated measles vaccine in children with Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia. The impact of malarial infection on the humoral immunological response to measles virus antigen was studied in 184 children aged 8-19 months in Guinea-Bissau. Pre- and post-immunization measles serology was performed using dried blood on absorbent paper and the ELISA technique. Blood smears obtained at the time of vaccination and 2 and 4 weeks afterwards were examined for malaria parasites. Pre-vaccination antibodies to measles were found in 44 out of 184 children (24%). Plasmodium falciparum was identified in 62 of the 132 initially non-immune children who completed the study. The rate of seroconversion was 127 out of 132 (96%). Post-immunization measles antibody titres were significantly higher in the vaccinees with P. falciparum than in those without malaria parasites in the blood.
