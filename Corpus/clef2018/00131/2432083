Detection of human antibodies against Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites using synthetic peptides. A large peptide consisting of about 40 (Asn-Ala-Asn-Pro) repeats of Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein, (NANP)40, was synthesized. It was recognized specifically by monoclonal antibodies produced against P. falciparum sporozoites. Moreover, this peptide strongly inhibited the binding of such monoclonal antibodies to antigens present in a sporozoite extract. The (NANP)40 peptide was employed without any carrier to develop an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect sporozoite-specific serum antibodies arising after natural malaria infections. Antibodies were detected in a high percentage (43.1%) of European patients suffering from acute P. falciparum malaria and in Africans living in an area of Gabon endemic for malaria. In the latter group, the frequency of antisporozoite antibodies increased with age, reaching 65.9% in individuals more than 40 years old. There was a significant correlation between the results obtained with an immunofluorescence assay with glutaraldehyde-fixed sporozoites and those obtained by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with (NANP)40. Therefore, such synthetic peptides representing the repetitive epitope of P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein can be used for the detection of antisporozoite antibodies and for the epidemiological studies required to obtain base-line data concerning the immune status of individuals before their participation in a sporozoite vaccine trial.
