Antibodies to the repetitive epitope of Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein in a rural Tanzanian community: a longitudinal study of 132 children. An ELISA employing a novel synthetic peptide consisting of 40 (Asn-Ala-Asn-Pro) repeats of Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein, (NANP)40, was used to detect antibodies against P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein in 132 children, 1 month to 15 years old, from a rural community (Kikwawila village) of Tanzania, a region where malaria is hyperendemic. The children were surveyed comprehensively over 3 consecutive years for clinical, parasitological, and serological parameters. Entomological data were also gathered for selected households in this village. The following results were obtained: anti-(NANP)40 antibodies increased as a function of age the majority of children over 10 years showed a stable positivity for such antibodies during the longitudinal study
