Multidetector CT imaging features of solid pseudopapillary tumours of the pancreas in male patients: distinctive imaging features with female patients. To describe multidetector CT imaging features of solid pseudopapillary tumours (SPTs) in male patients and to compare these imaging features with those found in female patients.The institutional review board approved this retrospective study. We included the CT images of 72 patients (M:F = 12:60 mean age, 35.0 years) diagnosed with SPT by histology. CT images were reviewed on the following: location of the tumour, maximal diameter, shape, margin and the fraction of the tumour composition. Statistical differences in CT imaging features were analysed.Male patients with SPTs were significantly older than female patients (42.4 years vs 33.4 years, p = 0.0408) and the mean size of the SPTs in male patients was larger (6.3 cm vs 4.6 cm, p = 0.0413) than that of SPTs in female patients. Lobulated shape of the SPTs was most frequent in male patients, whereas oval shape was most frequent in female patients (p = 0.0133). SPTs in male patients tended to have a solid component (p = 0.0434). Progressive enhancement in the solid portion of the tumour was seen in 9 (81.8%) of 11 SPTs in male patients and in 30 (79.0%) of 38 SPTs in female patients on multiphasic CT.The imaging features of SPTs in male patients usually appeared as a somewhat large-sized solid mass with a lobulated margin and progressive enhancement. These imaging features may help to differentiate SPTs from other pancreatic tumours for their proper management.SPTs in male patients appear as somewhat large-sized solid masses with lobulated margins, and this form occurs more frequently in older male patients than in female patients.
