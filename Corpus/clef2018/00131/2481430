A prospective study using a Latex particle agglutination test for the detection of bacterial antigens in CSF has been carried out in 91 patients in Kamuzu Central Hospital, Malawi. The antigens sought were those of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae b, Neisseria meningitidis B/E. coli K1, and Neisseria meningitidis A,C,Y,W 135.
