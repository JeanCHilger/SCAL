Synthesis and evaluation of 18F-labeled mitiglinide derivatives as positron emission tomography tracers for β-cell imaging. Measuring changes in β-cell mass in vivo during progression of diabetes mellitus is important for understanding the pathogenesis, facilitating early diagnosis, and developing novel therapeutics for this disease. However, a non-invasive method has not been developed. A novel series of mitiglinide derivatives (o-FMIT, m-FMIT and p-FMIT FMITs) were synthesized and their binding affinity for the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) of pancreatic islets were evaluated by inhibition studies. (+)-(S)-o-FMIT had the highest affinity of our synthesized FMITs (IC50=1.8μM). (+)-(S)-o-[(18)F]FMIT was obtained with radiochemical yield of 18% by radiofluorination of racemic precursor 7, hydrolysis, and optical resolution with chiral HPLC
