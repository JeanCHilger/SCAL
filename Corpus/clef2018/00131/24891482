Complete rupture of the pancreas after a kick into the abdomen during a football match. Pancreatic injury is uncommon, accounting for less than 7% of penetrating and 5% of blunt abdominal trauma. Blunt isolated pancreatic trauma in football has been rarely described in the literature and its diagnosis, detection and treatment still remains a challenge. We report a case of a young adult with an isolated complete rupture of the pancreatic body due to a blunt abdominal trauma during a football game. In order to preserve the pancreas and therefore retain function, we performed a terminolateral pancreaticojejunostomy. The postoperative course of the patient was uneventful. The diagnosis of isolated injuries of the pancreas in blunt abdominal trauma can be difficult and challenging and due to the nature of the game physicians should be highly alerted when dealing with football players sustaining abdominal trauma.
