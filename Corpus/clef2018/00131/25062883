Childhood cystic teratoma of the pancreas: clinical presentation, evaluation and management. Pancreatic cystic teratoma in children is extremely rare. Here we present a female infant with a mature cystic teratoma of the pancreatic body. The patient was admitted for a palpable abdominal mass and anorexia. Computed tomography (CT) indicated a huge cystic mass in the abdominal cavity. Exploratory laparotomy was performed, and the tumor was excised completely. Pathology confirmed the tumor was a mature cystic teratoma of pancreatic origin. Two months after the initial surgery, a pseudocyst was detected and then cystojejunostomy was performed. Fourteen months after the second surgery, tumor relapse occurred and distal pancreatectomy was performed. The patient remained well without tumor recurrence during the next 24 months of follow-up. Our experience suggests that clinical manifestations of children with pancreatic cystic teratomas might be nonspecific and preoperative diagnosis is difficult. Radical tumor resection and maximized preservation of healthy pancreatic tissue should always be balanced in surgical treatment.
