Comparative analysis of ERCP, IDUS, EUS and CT in predicting malignant bile duct strictures. To compare endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP), intraductal ultrasound (IDUS), endosonography (EUS), endoscopic transpapillary forceps biopsies (ETP) and computed tomography (CT) with respect to diagnosing malignant bile duct strictures.A patient cohort with bile duct strictures of unknown etiology was examined by ERCP and IDUS, ETP, EUS, and CT. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy rates of the diagnostic procedures were calculated based on the definite diagnoses proved by histopathology or long-term follow-up in those patients who did not undergo surgery. For each of the diagnostic measures, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy rates were calculated. In all cases, the gold standard was the histopathologic staging of specimens or long-term follow-up of at least 12 mo. A comparison of the accuracy rates between the localization of strictures was performed by using the Mann-Whitney U-test and the Ï‡(2) test as appropriate. A comparison of the accuracy rates between the diagnostic procedures was performed by using the McNemar's test. Differences were considered statistically significant if P < 0.05.A total of 234 patients (127 males, 107 females, median age 64, range 20-90 years) with indeterminate bile duct strictures were included. A total of 161 patients underwent operative exploration thus, a surgical histopathological correlation was available for those patients. A total of 113 patients had malignant disease proven by surgeryERCP/IDUS is superior to EUS and CT in providing accurate diagnoses of bile duct strictures of uncertain etiology. Multimodal diagnostics is recommended.
