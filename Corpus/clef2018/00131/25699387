Analysis of diagnosis and treatment for pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms: results of 47 cases in a single institution. There are few large sample, single-center series that focus on the methods of diagnosis, treatment and long-term survival of patients with Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (pNENs).Forty-seven patients with pNENs treated at Anhui province hospital affliated of Anhui Medical University during January 2002 to December 2013 were analyzed retrospectively. Clinical data were collected and statistically analyzed.The sensitivity of abdominal ultrasound, CT and MRI was 71.2% (28/39), 92.3% (38/41), and 75% (6/8), respectively. All patients received operation. 46 underwent radical surgery, pancreatic fistula in 9 patients, seroperitoneum in 4 patients, incisional infection in 4 patients. The cases of grade G1, G2, and G3 were 22, 19, and 6, respectively. The cases of stage I, II, III and IV were 32, 11, 4, and 0, respectively. The overall 1-, 3, and 5-year survival rates were 94.9%, 88.4%, and 84.4%. Univariate analysis showed that TNM, WHO classification, lymph nodes metastasis, vascular and neural invasion were risk factors of pNENs.Sprial CT was an optimal diagnostic method, while surgery was the first choice for treatment. Surgical resection in pNENs results in long-term survival. TNM, WHO classification, lymphatic metastasis, vascular and neural invasion were closely related to the prognosis of pNENs.
