Individualized perfusion of sargent gloryvine decoction for clinical severe acute pancreatitis treatment. To observe the effects of Sargent gloryvine decoction (SGD) on severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) treatment and to evaluate its clinical value.112 patients of SAP in our hospital from January, 2005 to December, 2012 were recruited for retrospective analysis. They were divided into two groups, SGD group (62 patients) and control group without treated with SGD (50 patients). Inflammation factor, CT grade and Ranson grade were used to estimate the severity of SAP, and were compared in these two groups. In addition, peripancreatic infection, incidence of pseudo pancreatic cyst, time of anal exsufflation and duration of fever were used to evaluate the effect of SGD treatment. After perfusion of SGD for different time, hospitalization days and cost were recorded to evaluate clinical value of SGD.After perfusion, many indexes in SGD were remarkably superior to those of control group, such as duration of fever, incidence of pseudo pancreatic cyst, peripancreatic infection and Ranson grade. Meanwhile, SGD can sharply down-regulate inflammation reaction levels of SAP patients, so that the hospitalization days and costs can be obviously saved.According to comparison, perfusion of SGD is a potential candidate for SAP treatment and is valuable in clinical application.
