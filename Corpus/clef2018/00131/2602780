Pattern of infection in hematologic malignancies: an Indian experience. Ninety-nine consecutive patients who received cytotoxic therapy for acute leukemia were retrospectively studied to determine the pattern of infection at the Tata Memorial Hospital, Bombay, India. In all, 224 infective episodes occurred in these patients. Bacterial infection was the commonest type, accounting for 152 (67.9%) of 224 infective episodes, followed by fungal and viral infections (15.6% and 14.3%, respectively). Gram-negative organisms (Pseudomonas and Klebsiella) were the commonest bacterial organisms isolated, constituting 38 (76%) of 50 positive cultures infection with Staphylococcus was rare (10%). Infective hepatitis, malaria, and systemic tuberculosis were responsible for fever with neutropenia in 20, 4, and 2 patients, respectively. Three hundred fifty-two patients with lymphoproliferative malignancies were also retrospectively studied to determine the pattern of infection. Only 53 infective episodes were recorded. In these patients, in contrast to those with acute leukemia, viral infection (33 [62.3%] of 53) and pulmonary tuberculosis (18 [34%] of 53) were frequently seen. It is interesting that 50% of our patients with hairy cell leukemia also had tuberculosis. Bacterial infection was conspicuous by its absence. Knowledge of the prevailing pattern of infection permits the development of investigative and therapeutic approaches of optimal efficacy.
