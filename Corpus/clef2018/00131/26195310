EUS Diagnostic Criteria for Chronic Pancreatitis: A Comparison of Conventional Versus Rosemont Criteria. To compare the Rosemont criteria, which are graded features chosen by experts in 2007, versus the conventional criteria, which require â‰¥ 3-5 of the 9 features that are "counted as equal," for the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis by EUS.This is a retrospective cohort study. EUS examinations were scored using both criteria, and the following categories compared: 3-CC versus "consistent with" chronic pancreatitis by RC 3-CC versus "consistent with" and "suggestive of" chronic pancreatitis by RCThere was a statistically significant difference between 3-CC and RC, either "consistent with" alone or both "consistent with" and "suggestive of" (p < 0.0001). Comparing 5-CC and "consistent with" showed a statistical difference (p = 0.0014), but no difference comparing 5-CC to "consistent with" and "suggestive of."CC diagnose more cases of chronic pancreatitis than RC when using 3-CC or when comparing 5-CC to "consistent with" chronic pancreatitis by Rosemont, indicating that the Rosemont criteria are more stringent.
