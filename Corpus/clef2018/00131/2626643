Analysis of the specificity of human antibodies to antigens of Leishmania braziliensis braziliensis. The antigenicity of promastigotes of Leishmania braziliensis braziliensis (L. b. braziliensis) treated with 1% sodium desoxycholate in 10 mM Tris-Hcl pH 8.2 was analysed by immunoblot using as probes sera from American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL), American visceral leishmaniasis (AVL), schistosomiasis, malaria and Chagas' disease. The ACL sera reacted constantly with a 60 kD band. No reactivity to this protein was observed with sera from the other diseases above mentioned indicating that the 60 kD protein may be used in serodiagnosis for ACL.
