A case of epidermoid cyst in an intrapancreatic accessory spleen showing cyst-in-cyst-like structure mimicking mucinous cystic neoplasm. In 2010, a 39-year-old woman presented with a cystic lesion, 16 mm in diameter, in the tail of the pancreas. Regular follow-ups were conducted to monitor this lesion its diameter was found to increase to 45 mm in 2013. Thus, the patient was admitted to our hospital for further examination and treatment. Abdominal US, abdominal contrast-enhanced CT, and MRI showed a cystic lesion of 45 mm in diameter in the tail of the pancreas, which had internal septae and mural nodules inside. EUS revealed a cyst-in-cyst-like structure, with a thickened cystic wall along the entire circumference. Thus, distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy were performed on the basis of a diagnosis of mucinous cystic neoplasm. Histopathological examination of a resected specimen showed that the lesion comprised a substantial component of red-brown tone, with adjacent cystic components. The final diagnosis was an epidermoid cyst in an intrapancreatic accessory spleen.
