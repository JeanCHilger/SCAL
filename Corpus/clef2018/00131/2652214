Usefulness of echography with pancreatic stimulation in the evaluation of acute pancreatitis associated with pancreas divisum. Pancreas divisum is an anatomic variation of the fusion of the pancreatic ducts that appears in 6-10% of the normal population. In recent years, with the development of endoscopic cholangiopancreatography, pancreas divisum has been related to recurrent acute pancreatitis, although its continuous interrelation remains debated. We present a case of acute pancreatitis with pancreas divisum. Echography after pancreatic stimulation with secretin (EEPS) was useful to evaluate the degree of stenosis of the accessory papilla, showing dilatation maintained for 30 minutes of the dorsal duct after stimulation. Postoperative echography with secretin pancreatic stimulation after surgical sphincteroplasty showed no modification in the caliber of the accessory duct, which allowed us to discern the solution to the obstructive problem. We discuss the clinical utility and prognostic value of echography with secretin pancreatic stimulation in the treatment of pancreas divisum.
