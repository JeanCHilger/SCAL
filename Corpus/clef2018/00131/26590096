Is the 2-cm size cutoff relevant for small nonfunctioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: A French multicenter study. Nonfunctioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NF-PNETs) are often discovered at a small size. No clear consensus exists on the management of NF-PNETs ≤ 2 cm. The aim of our study was to determine the prognostic value of indicators of malignancy in sporadic NF-PNETs ≤ 2 cm.Eighty patients were evaluated retrospectively in 7 French University Hospital Centers. Patients were managed by operative resection (operative group [OG]) or observational follow-up (non-OG [NOG]). Pathologic characteristics and outcomes were analyzed.Sixty-six patients (58% women) were in the OG (mean age, 59 years 95% CI, 56.0-62.3Based on our retrospective study, the cutoff of 2 cm of malignancy used for small NF-PNETs could be decreased to 1.7 cm to select patients more accurately.
