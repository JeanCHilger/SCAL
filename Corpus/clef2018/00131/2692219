Comparison of antibody responses to the circumsporozoite protein repeat region and to intact sporozoites during acute falciparum malaria. Most acute falciparum malaria patients mount an antibody response to the circumsporozoite (CS) protein which contains a dominant B-cell epitope. In order to investigate whether antibodies against other epitopes on the sporozoite surface may be important during a particular phase of infection or convalescence, we longitudinally studied the antibody responses of 13 Thai patients with acute falciparum malaria. Antibody comparisons were made using intact Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites in an indirect fluorescent antibody test and the recombinant peptide, R32tet32, as capture antigen in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Antibody response curves derived using the 2 methods were similar, and adsorption with R32tet32 greatly (greater than 95%) diminished anti-sporozoite activity in sera. Thus, peptide constructs containing the CS repeat region epitope, (NANP)n, can be used with confidence to assay anti-sporozoite antibodies, independent of both the time of infection and prior malaria history.
