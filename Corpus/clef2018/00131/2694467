Evaluation of malaria clinics in Maesot, Thailand: use of serology to assess coverage. The clinics of the anti-malaria programme in Thailand serve an increasingly important role in the strategy for control of malaria within a context of multi-drug resistant falciparum malaria. Figures from clinics in Maesot District show a predominance of young males among positive cases treated (56% of all cases). In contrast, sero-epidemiological findings from a random sample of over 500 villagers in the area show similar exposure rates among males and females of equal age. There were no statistically significant differences between males and females 0-15 and 16-30 years old in percentages positive by indirect fluorescent antibody tests or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), mean level of ELISA positivity, or rate of sero-conversion. Differences in level of positivity did occur between males and females over 30. An index constructed from the serological findings indicated under-representation of children and women of all ages in clinics but suggested that coverage of children could be improved by the provision of a community-based, fixed-schedule mobile clinic.
