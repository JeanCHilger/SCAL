Field applications of agglutination and cytoadherence assays with Plasmodium falciparum from Papua New Guinea. Plasmodium falciparum isolates obtained directly from patients in Papua New Guinea were tested in their first cycle of growth in vitro for adherence to melanoma cells and for susceptibility to agglutination by immune serum. Binding varied among isolates and, in many cases, increased with further rounds of replication under optimal culture conditions. Binding inhibition assays and agglutination assays demonstrated extreme heterogeneity of surface antigens apparently none of the sera from adult patients recognized all of the variants presented.
