Dot-immunobinding assay (DIBA) with integral Plasmodium falciparum as antigen in immuno-diagnosis of falciparum malaria. Among the available immuno-diagnostic methods of parasitoses, dot-immunobinding assay (DIBA) has been proved to be promising for its high sensitivity and specificity, easy performance, lack of need of special equipment, and consequently its practical usage in field work. In previously reported tests, soluble antigen was used, thus a sonicator and an ultracentrifuge were required to produce the antigen. This paper reports the application of integral P. falciparum as antigen in DIBA to detect antibodies in falciparum malaria cases. Of 52 sera from falciparum malaria patients tested, 49 (94.2%) showed positive reactions, which was similar to the result using soluble antigen in DIBA (96.2%) and was higher than that in IFA (86.5%) and ELISA (80.8%). No false positive was revealed in 48 control sera from healthy individuals and sera from visceral leishmaniasis, paragonimiasis, fasciolopsiasis and schistosomiasis patients.
