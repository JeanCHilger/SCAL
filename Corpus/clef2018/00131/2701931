Osteoclast-like giant cell tumor of the pancreas associated with cystadenocarcinoma. Osteoclast-like giant cell tumor is a very rare type of pancreatic malignancy, and no more than 20 cases have been reported in the English literatures. A case of this tumor associated with cystadenocarcinoma is reported. This giant cell is undistinguishable on light microscopy from osteoclast of bone and correct diagnosis of this unusual tumor is important because of its relatively poor prognosis.
