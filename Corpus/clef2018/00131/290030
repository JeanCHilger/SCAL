CT scanning in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and carcinoid syndrome. Computed tomography of the upper abdomen was performed in 11 patients with Z--E syndrome and 6 patients with carcinoid syndrome. The liver, pancreas, spleen and upper part of the retroperitoneal space were examined to localize a primary tumour and/or metastases. The CT findings were correlated to the final diagnoses obtained by operation or by other diagnostic procedures. The correlation between CT and the clinical findings was acceptable, and we are of the opinion that with further experience this new noninvasive radiological technique might be a helpful tool in the preoperative evaluation in these diseases. Furthermore, CT is an easy method in the control of a tumour or metastases during treatment.
