Diagnosis and treatment of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. A diagnostic and therapeutic strategy for the management of patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome has been developed, based on the review of a large personal experience and the most recent literature. The mainstay of a modern ZES management is the eradication of tumoral processes whenever feasible. Diagnosis is centred upon gastric acid and gastrin secretion measurements both in basal conditions and on secretin stimulation. Recognition of other endocrine involvement and familial inheritance is of the utmost importance in distinguishing sporadic ZES patients from those who have the condition known as multiple endocrine neoplasia type I. Blood calcium and phosphorus levels, parathyroid hormone concentration, combined if necessary with urinary cyclic AMP excretion measurement, should be performed routinely once ZES diagnosis is established or highly suspected. Localization of the tumour is the next essential step, and this has been considerably facilitated by the recent development in imaging techniques: it involves computerized axial tomography and selective abdominal angiography, a combination of which allows tumour detection in 60-70% of sporadic gastrinoma patients, with a maximal sensitivity for well-developed hepatic metastases. In sporadic ZES exploratory laparotomy is legitimate when preoperative localization of the tumour has failed this laparotomy will allow further detection and then eradication of gastrinomas in a significant number of patients. Control of gastric acid secretion is mandatory throughout the work-up period
