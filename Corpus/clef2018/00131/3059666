Recent applications of the Dot-ELISA in immunoparasitology. The dot enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Dot-ELISA) is a highly versatile solid-phase immunoassay for antibody or antigen detection. The assay uses minute amounts of reagent dotted onto solid surfaces such as nitrocellulose and other paper membranes which avidly bind proteins. After incubation with antigen-specific antibody and enzyme-conjugated anti-antibody, the addition of a precipitable, chromogenic substrate causes the formation of a colored dot on the solid phase which is visually read. The Dot-ELISA has been used extensively in the detection of human and veterinary protozoan and metazoan parasitic diseases, including amebiasis, babesiosis, fascioliasis, cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis, cysticercosis, echinococcosis, malaria, schistosomiasis, toxocariasis, toxoplasmosis, trichinosis, trypanosomiasis and even ixodid tick infestation. The technique is rapid, easy to perform and interpret, reagent conservative, cost effective and field portable. In addition, the Dot-ELISA may be configured to detect antibodies or parasite antigen in either microtiter plates for large-batch testing or with dipsticks for small numbers of determinations. A slight modification of the Dot-ELISA procedure allows the determination of infection rates of vectors such as ticks and sandflies with parasites.
