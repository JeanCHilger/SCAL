Dot-ELISA, a potential immunoassay for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum antibodies. The dot enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (dot-ELISA) was compared to the indirect immunofluorescent assay (IIFA) and radioimmunoassay (RIA) for the detection of malaria antibodies. Of 281 sera tested by dot-ELISA, 220 were from Ethiopia, 11 from the Sudan, and 50 from Egypt. A close correlation between the dot-ELISA and RIA results was observed in 92% of the 220 Ethiopian cases. Of the remainder, 6% gave positive RIA and negative dot-ELISA results, and 2% gave positive dot-ELISA and negative RIA results. Antibody titres determined by dot-ELISA and RIA were positively correlated in 10 of the 11 Sudanese cases tested by direct microscopical examination. The eleventh case was positive by dot-ELISA at 1:1000 dilution, but negative by RIA and direct examination. With the 50 Egyptian sera, the dot-ELISA results showed close correspondence to the IIFA results, but the dot-ELISA was 20-40 fold more sensitive than the IIFA. To test specificity, 62 samples from patients with 11 different diseases and conditions were examined by dot-ELISA. No malaria antibodies were detected in any of these or in sera from healthy controls. Dot-ELISA is a potentially useful method for sero-epidemiological studies of malaria.
