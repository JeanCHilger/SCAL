Shared polypeptides from various strains of Plasmodium falciparum recognized by Cameroon sera. Sera collected from 176 individuals residing in three malaria-endemic regions of Cameroon, West Africa, were tested against Plasmodium falciparum isolates from different areas of the world by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), growth inhibition studies, and immunoprecipitation assays. A wide range of parasite proteins with apparent molecular weights of 14 to 250 kilodaltons (Kd) were immunoprecipitated by the sera. Of these, two polypeptides of 41 and 96 Kd could be associated with parasite growth inhibition in vitro.
