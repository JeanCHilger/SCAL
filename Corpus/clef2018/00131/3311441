The efficiency of sporozoite transmission in the human malarias, Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax. Reported are malaria sporozoite and inoculation rates over a 1-year period in eight epidemiologically defined villages of different endemicity in Madang Province, Papua New Guinea. In the study, more than 41 000 wild-caught mosquitos were analysed for Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax sporozoites by ELISA. In a given village the entomological inoculation rates correlated strongly with the prevalences of both these malarial parasites in children. However, the prevalence of P. falciparum infections in children was much higher than that of P. vivax, despite similar inoculation rates for the two species. These data suggest that in Papua New Guinea P. falciparum is more efficiently transmitted than P. vivax from mosquito to man. The increased efficiency of transmission of P. falciparum may be due to the heavier sporozoite densities in wild-caught mosquitos naturally infected with P. falciparum sporozoites that were tenfold greater than the sporozoite densities in mosquitos infected with P. vivax.
