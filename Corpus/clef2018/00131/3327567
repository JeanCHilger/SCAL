Blood rheology in general medicine and surgery. Traditionally, blood rheology tests have been used in diagnosis and monitoring of infection, rheumatic diseases and malignancy, and are still of clinical value in these conditions. In the last twenty years, clinical and epidemiological studies have shown that the haematological determinants of blood flow resistance (haematocrit, fibrinogen, white cell count and altered red and white cell rigidity) are also associated with nutritional, metabolic, endocrine and vascular disorders. Decreased red cell deformability may contribute to reduced red cell survival and anaemia in burns, malaria, liver disease and kidney failure. In trauma and inflammatory disease, overt hyperviscosity is usually prevented by vasodilatation and reduction in the haematocrit. However, low-flow states may arise systemically from haemoconcentration (contracted plasma volume, Chapter 3) in severe burns, inappropriate red cell transfusion, or dehydration due to illness systemically in circulatory shock
