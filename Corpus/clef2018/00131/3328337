Detection of homologous and heterologous malaria antibodies by application of Plasmodium falciparum merozoite antigen to an ELISA. Sera of patients with anti-plasmodial antibodies determined by indirect fluorescence antibody test (IFAT) were used to evaluate an enzyme immunoassay (IgG ELISA) for determining antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum merozoite antigen. The two tests correlated well. Antibodies to species other than P. falciparum, however, were detected by P. falciparum merozoite antigen to a limited extent only.
