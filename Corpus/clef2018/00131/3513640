Field trial in Chiapas, Mexico, of a rapid detection method for malaria in anopheline vectors with low infection rates. A method consisting of filtration of up to 100 macerated mosquitoes in a batch, followed by fixation with glutaraldehyde and concentration of filtrate by centrifugation has been developed to rapidly assess malaria infection in anopheline mosquitoes. Determination of the presence of sporozoites is made by observation of a sample of the final filtrate with a phase microscope. The method is simple and field adaptable, essential factors for the application of any technique to large scale field operations. Application of the technique in El Gancho, Chiapas, Mexico, in February 1984 yielded an infection rate for Anopheles albimanus of 0.9% for intradomicile-collected human bait mosquitoes and 0.1% for peridomicile-collected human bait mosquitoes.
