ELISA test in sero-epidemiologic studies of human malaria. Evaluation of an antigen prepared from erythrocytes of Saimiri sciureus experimentally infected with Plasmodium falciparum. A soluble antigen was prepared from squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) infected with blood-passaged Plasmodium falciparum, and evaluated in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as a potent antigen for malaria diagnostic. The specificity, reproducibility and sensibility of the test showed the suitability of our antigenic preparation in detecting antibodies, IgG and IgM, in patients with P. falciparum infections. Thus, the Saimiri monkey represents an interesting alternative to the classicals sources of parasites from which P. falciparum antigens are commonly extracted (continuous culture and natural infections).
