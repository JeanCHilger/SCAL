Potential vectors of malaria and their different susceptibility to Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax in northern Brazil identified by immunoassay. During the period from May 1983 to July 1985 we conducted an epidemiological study to determine potential vectors of malaria in 6 districts in the state of Par√° in northern Brazil. The examination of random human blood smears, prepared at the time of mosquito capture, indicated overall human infection rates of 16.7% and 10.9% for Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax, respectively. Two immunoassays, the immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), based on the use of species-specific antisporozoite monoclonal antibodies, were used to analyze a total of 9,040 field-collected Anopheles mosquitoes for plasmodial infection. P. falciparum sporozoite antigen was detected in A. darlingi at rates varying from 2.7% to 4.2%, and in small numbers of A. oswaldoi collected in 1 of the districts. In contrast, sporozoite antigen of P. vivax was found in A. darlingi, A. triannulatus, A. nuneztovari, and A. albitarsis at rates ranging from 0.9% to 12.0%. By dissection, sporozoites were found in the salivary glands of these same 4 species at rates ranging from 0.8% to 2.2%. The latter 3 species had not previously been implicated as malaria vectors of any significance in northern Brazil.
