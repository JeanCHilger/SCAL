Solid and papillary epithelial neoplasm of the pancreas presenting as a traumatic cyst. Case report. A 16-year-old girl presented with a left-sided abdominal mass following blunt trauma. Clinically and ultrasonographically a pseudocyst of the pancreas was suspected. Computed tomography demonstrated a moderately vascularized tumour mass in the pancreatic tail, with a central cystic space. Distal pancreatectomy was subsequently performed. Histologic examination revealed a solid and papillary epithelial neoplasm of the pancreas. This is a well-defined clinicopathologic entity, mostly found in young women. Histologic evidence of aggressive behaviour is sometimes seen, and was found in the present case. The prognosis after surgical removal is good, however, which emphasizes the importance of recognizing this rare tumour.
