CT scanning and ultrasound in the evaluation of pancreatic pseudocysts: a preliminary comparison. A retrospective review of 12 surgically proved cases of pancreatic pseudocyst was performed. CT correctly demonstrated 6/8 uncomplicated pseudocysts and 4/4 infected pseudocysts. Ultrasound identified 7/8 uncomplicated and 2/4 infected pseudocysts. Errors by one modality are due to limitations not shared by the other method. This suggests a basis for the complementary use of CT scanning and ultrasound in the evaluation of suspected pancreatic pseudocysts.
