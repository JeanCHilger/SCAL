Computer-assisted multiple categorization of absorbance values in ELISA through pictorial emulation of 96-well plates. A simple algorithm is proposed by which multiple categorization of absorbance values from ELISA plates is performed under a microcomputer control. The printed output is a pictorial emulation of a 96-well plate with the color intensities represented for each reaction. Although the method is presented as a colorimeter computer interfaced system, a provision for manual entry of absorbance values via keyboard is also included. Simulation is based solely on the magnitude of absorbance values. Therefore, it is possible to utilize any enzyme/substrate combination within the range of filters of the colorimeter. We have tested the present system for titration of anti-malarial antibodies in human serum and for the screening of mouse hybridoma culture supernatants.
