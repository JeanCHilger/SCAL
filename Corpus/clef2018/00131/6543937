Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the identification of mosquito bloodmeals. An ELISA for the identification of mosquito bloodmeals (MBM) is described. The technique makes use of commercial antisera and allows to investigate at least three different animal sources on the same MBM. The efficiency of identification is 100% for up to 20 hrs-digested MBM.
