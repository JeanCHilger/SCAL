CT of benign cystic abdominal masses in children. Computed tomography (CT) correctly portrayed the gross anatomic features of six mesenteric, omental, and ovarian cysts and diagnosed two pancreatic pseudocysts in children. Large, well defined, low-density masses were found, often containing septa and filling most of the abdomen and pelvis. CT displayed the size and extent of the mass and showed extrinsic compression or displacement of surrounding structures. Different pathologic entities may have similar CT appearances, particularly with very large cystic masses.
