Computer tomography following splenectomy. After splenectomy a displacement of the left kidney, stomach, colon and pancreas can be observed. The scar tissue regularly contains fat. The differentiation between haematoma and empyema may be difficult in certain cases. Large holes and those containing liquid and air may be attributed wrongly to the stomach or colon. Additional investigations are often necessary. Differential diagnosis between a residual spleen and a tumour recurrency may be difficult, if there is no follow-up examination.
