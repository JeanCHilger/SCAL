Phlegmon of the pancreas. One of the significant complications of pancreatitis is the development of a pancreatic phlegmon, a noninfected solid mass of inflamed pancreatic and retroperitoneal tissues. Clinically, a phlegmon may be confused with other pancreatic masses, especially a pseudocyst. Phlegmons typically present as palpable epigastric masses which are solid on sonography and computerized tomography. They usually resolve in a few weeks with nonsurgical conservative therapy. This report discusses the radiographic and clinical picture of pancreatic phlegmons as illustrated by four cases.
