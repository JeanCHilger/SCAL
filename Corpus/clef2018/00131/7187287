Computer tomographic studies on the dynamics of liposynthesis and lipolysis of the human liver. Following an analysis of the most important metabolic disturbances and other diseases associated with fatty degeneration of the liver, it is shown, basing on a previous study, by means of examples, that subtle diagnosis of changes of the fatty content of the liver can be achieved via CT density measurement. Lipolysis in alcoholic fatty liver is quantified during abstention from alcohol, and a lipolysis factor of 1% fatty decomposition per day is determined from the measurements. Observations in pancreatitis with liver lipid storage during the course of the disease, point to an enzymatic weakness in lipid metabolism. Case histories show fatty degeneration associated with an enhanced cortisone serum level (in adrenal adenoma and cortisone therapy) and in poorly stabilized diabetes mellitus. It is concluded from the studies that determination of the relative fatty content by CT densitometry should be conducted as a routine procedure and that pathological lipid content should stimulate subtle diagnosis of the pancreas and the adrenals. In addition, examinations repeated during the course of the disease with assessment of change in fatty content, will be useful for assessing the value of the therapy employed.
