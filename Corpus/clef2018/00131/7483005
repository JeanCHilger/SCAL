Tumour necrosis factor alpha in uncomplicated malaria in young adults. The purpose of this study was: 1) to measure tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF) in the plasma of Plasmodium falciparum infected subjects and 2) to correlate the presence of TNF to symptomatology. Plasma from 77 malaria infected individuals (with malaria parasites) were assayed for TNF by ELISA. The mean age of the subjects under study was 16.36 +/- 0.80 (mean +/- SEM) years. Thirty-nine (51%) subjects had measurable plasma TNF. Taking symptomatology into account, 10 (59%) of the 17 asymptomatics and 29 (48%) of the 60 symptomatics had measurable plasma TNF. A risk ratio of 0.9 was obtained for the association between the detection of plasma TNF and the presence of symptoms. In plasma from 13 healthy controls no TNF was detected. The results suggest that if TNF plays a negative role in the pathogenesis of malaria, it must be in the presence of other predisposing factors.
