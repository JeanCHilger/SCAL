HLA-A2-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses to multiple Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite surface protein 2 epitopes in sporozoite-immunized volunteers. CD8+ CTL specific for the Plasmodium yoelii sporozoite surface protein 2 (PySSP2) protect mice against malaria. For this reason, vaccines designed to induce CTL against P. falciparum SSP2 (PfSSP2) are under development. Optimal development of PfSSP2 as a component of human malaria vaccines requires characterization of HLA class I-restricted CTL against this Ag. For this purpose, PBMC from four HLA-A2+ human volunteers immunized with P. falciparum irradiated sporozoites were stimulated with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing PfSSP2 and with 35 PfSSP2-derived 15-amino acid peptides containing sequences conforming to HLA-A2 binding motifs. Ag-specific, genetically restricted, CD8+ T cell-dependent cytotoxic activity against autologous target cells transfected with the PfSSP2 gene was demonstrated in the four volunteers. Twelve of the 35 peptides sensitized HLA-A2-matched target cells for lysis by peptide-stimulated effectors. Three volunteers had CTL against 9 of the 12 peptides, and one had no peptide-specific CTL. HLA-A*0201 restriction was confirmed by demonstrating that effectors from the three responders could be stimulated with six different peptides to lyse HLA-A*0201+ T2 cells incubated with the homologous peptides. Peptide-specific, genetically restricted, CD8+ T cell-dependent cytotoxic activity was also demonstrated against two peptides using unstimulated PBMC as effectors. Available data indicate that the motif-bearing sequences in 6 of the 12 positive peptides are conserved among P. falciparum isolates and clones. Demonstration of HLA-A2-restricted CTL responses to multiple PfSSP2-derived peptides, and of circulating activated CTL against PfSSP2 in immune volunteers provide important information for optimal design and evaluation of vaccines containing this pre-erythrocytic stage Ag.
