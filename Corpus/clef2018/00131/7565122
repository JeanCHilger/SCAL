Transmission blocking immunity as observed in a feeder system and serological reactivity to Pfs 48/45 and Pfs230 in field sera. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and human sera from gametocyte carriers were applied in the bio-assay to test for their transmission-blocking capacity. Competition ELISA's have been developed for the detection of natural transmission blocking antibodies. Approximately 55% of the sera blocking in the bio-assay gave positive results in these competition ELISA's.
