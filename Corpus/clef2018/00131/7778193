Integrated health programmes. Over a period of 10 years, a hospital in rural Africa slowly built an integrated primary and secondary health care program to the point where it has more than 40 elements.  In its initial stage (1982-84), hospital staff and community participants were trained, the number of mobile clinics was increased, community participation was sought, and health education was emphasized.  During 1985-86, 92 village health committees were organized with 70 trained Village Health Workers (VHWs).  This led to a rapid increase in vaccination rates, the use of oral rehydration therapy, and training of traditional birth attendants.  In 1987-88, 14 VHW were trained to use basic medical kits and distribute medicines.  By 1990, 18,000 of the 72,000 outpatient treatments were administered by VHWs.  In 1987, the hospital made a community diagnosis and increased the size of its advisory board (which became 60% female).  Because the community identified food, water, and poverty as its priorities, the hospital took steps to improve the food supply, the water supply, and the financial position of the women.  In 1989-90, the primary health care (PHC) project added the components of family planning, a weaning food production unit, food coupons, food for work, grain banks, a trust fund, literacy classes, health stamps, a mobile malnutrition clinic, subsidized fertilizer and seed, low-cost care for victims of AIDS, new malaria treatment schedules, and a housing association.  The PHC program has resulted in a reduction in under-five deaths from the national average of 330/1000 to 145/1000 (other areas have reduced deaths to 270-300/1000.  The program is also becoming increasingly cost-effective, costing about 6 pounds per capita over 10 years for a population of 50,000.  Country-wide implementation of the PHC program would require only 30% of the present health budget.
