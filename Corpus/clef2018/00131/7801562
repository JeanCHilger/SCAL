Radiodiagnosis of postnecrotic complications of caudal pancreatitis. The left kidney and pararenal connective tissue were involved in the process in 3 cases of 5 with caudal pancreatitis complications. A complex of radiodiagnostic methods including, besides x-ray examinations, ultrasonic method and computer-aided tomography, was used to detect the routes of exudate dissemination from the caudal portion of the pancreas into cellular spaces. If a destructive or interstitial form of chronic pancreatitis is detected, radiation screening of all the possible routes of the exudate dissemination (omental sac, left subdiaphragmatic space, left pararenal area, and the lateral canal) is recommended. Detection of pathologic formation in these areas implies thorough examinations of the pancreas making use of x-ray, ultrasonic, and endoscopic methods to rule out or confirm pancreatitis.
