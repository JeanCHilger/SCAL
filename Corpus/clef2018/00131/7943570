Plasmodium vivax: immune responses in a cross-section of the population in the Delhi area of India. The immune status of the individuals living in the Delhi area of northern India where Plasmodium vivax is predominant is described. The majority of the individuals who were acutely infected with P. vivax had antibodies against crude blood-stage antigen and the recombinant antigen, PV9. In contrast, the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the majority of these individuals did not show proliferation in the presence of either of these antigens. There was no correlation between antibody levels and T cell proliferation. Such an immune status of individuals living in endemic areas should be taken into account in the future in developing P. vivax malaria vaccines.
