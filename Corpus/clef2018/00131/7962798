CT findings in groove pancreatitis: correlation with histopathological findings. To clarify the CT characteristics of groove pancreatitis, which is a segmental form of chronic pancreatitis.The CT findings in four patients with proved groove pancreatitis were reviewed retrospectively. The examinations consisted of plain CT, dynamic CT, and high dose enhancement CT in each patient. Correlation between the CT findings and the resected specimens was performed in three patients.In every patient a mass was detected in the head of the pancreas that involved the duodenum. Dynamic CT demonstrated a poorly enhancing lesion extending between the pancreatic head and the duodenum. Cysts in the duodenal wall and/or the groove and duodenal stenosis due to wall thickening were seen in four and three patients, respectively. These CT findings reflect the histological characteristics of this disease.Computed tomography, including dynamic study, can demonstrate the characteristic findings of groove pancreatitis and suggest the diagnosis.
