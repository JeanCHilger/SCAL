Solitary metastasis to the head of the pancreas in hypernephroid carcinoma. Metastatic renal cell carcinoma is a major cause of cancer death. Most metastases occur within the first three months after diagnosis of the primary. Solitary metastases at unusual sites are not untypical, and therefore require particular attention. Pancreatic metastasis in general and from a renal cell carcinoma in particular, represent a rare finding. Within the period between 1986 and 1993, only a single patient with a solitary pancreas metastasis was diagnosed and surgically treated at our hospital. Four years after operation, the patient continued to be tumor- and symptom-free.
