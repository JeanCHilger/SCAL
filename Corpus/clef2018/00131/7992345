Towards optimal regimens of parenteral quinine for young African children with cerebral malaria: unbound quinine concentrations following a simple loading dose regimen. Nine children with severe falciparum malaria were treated with an intravenous quinine regimen which did not require burettes or infusion pumps, to determine its practicability and to ensure that therapeutic drug concentrations were achieved and maintained throughout the dose interval. The regimen comprised quinine dihydrochloride (15 mg/kg 12.5 mg/kg of the free base), which was added to a bag of intravenous fluid (after wastage of all but 100 mL), and given via standard giving sets over 2 h. Blood was drawn sequentially during the infusion, and for 12 h thereafter
