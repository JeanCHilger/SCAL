Evaluation of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the diagnosis of kala-azar in Malda district (West Bengal). An immunological test based on indirect (plate) ELISA has been successfully standardized and modified using promastigote soluble antigen. The test carried out on 813 subjects from a kala-azar endemic area (including parasitologically confirmed patients, subjects presenting with clinical symptoms of visceral leishmaniasis and endemic controls) and a non-endemic area (with diseases other than kala-azar and apparently normal subjects) was found to detect, specifically, antileishmanial antibodies. The plate ELISA has been simplified to a more sensitive dot-ELISA where the results are read within 2-3 h. The antigen requirement is 250 ng per test. No cross-reactivity with sera from patients of malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy, amoebiasis and filariasis was observed. The follow up monitoring of antibodies in successfully treated kala-azar patients showed a decline of antibodies. A drop of blood taken on filter paper is sufficient to conduct the test. Dot ELISA therefore is a simple, inexpensive and stable test in serodiagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis.
