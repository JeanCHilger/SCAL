Microcystic serous cystadenoma of the pancreas. Enucleation or regulated pancreatic resection?. Cystic benign tumors of the pancreas are rare lesions: they represent less than 10% of all pancreatic neoplasms. We studied two cases of microcystic adenoma, one of the less common varieties, that only in the last few years has been morphologically recognized as a distinct pathological entity. Our clinical experience--though limited--made us remark some interesting features: 1) preoperative diagnostic procedures (ultrasonography and CT) may present great interpretative difficulties: in one of the cases observed, radiographic imaging demonstrated an unresectable pancreatic tumor. On the contrary, in both cases surgical radicality has been achieved 2) preoperative needle aspiration cytology (FNAB) does not always provide diagnostic material, as happened in both case observed
