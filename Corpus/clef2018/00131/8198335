The rationale for surgical treatment of mesenteric and retroperitoneal cysts. Mesenteric and retroperitoneal cysts are rare, usually asymptomatic lesions. Because of this, several recommendations in the literature caution against operative therapy in the absence of symptoms. During a recent 10 year period, six patients presented to our hospital with symptomatic mesenteric or retroperitoneal cysts two of these patients were septic and had infection within the cyst. All six patients underwent excision with complete resolution of symptoms and no morbidity. With the advent of frequent abdominal CT scanning for a variety of reasons, it is likely that more of these lesions will be noted in the future. In view of the potential for development of symptoms and complications, we feel that any good risk patient found to harbor such a cyst should undergo complete excision.
