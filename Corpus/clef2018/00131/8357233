Imaging of the kidney, liver, and pancreas transplant. Imaging of the renal, hepatic, and pancreas allograft is essential for evaluation of postoperative complications. Surgical complications after organ transplantation can generally be specifically diagnosed. These complications include obstruction, leakage, peritransplant fluid collections, and vascular problems such as vascular stenosis or thrombosis, arteriovenous fistula, and pseudoaneurysm. Using computed tomography (CT) or ultrasound guidance, interventional procedures can often be performed to treat various surgical complications. On the other hand, medical causes of allograft transplant dysfunction such as rejection, acute tubular necrosis, drug toxicity, ischemia, infection, inflammation, or the development of recurrent disease are frequently associated with nonspecific imaging findings. Allograft biopsy is still usually necessary for definitive diagnosis in these cases. In this article, we will briefly outline the spectrum of abnormalities that can be seen in the allograft recipient and show some examples of these complications.
