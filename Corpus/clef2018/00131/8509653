Fast immunopurification of small amounts of specific antibodies on peptides bound to ELISA plates. ELISA is widely used as a means to detect antibodies, but the potential of ELISA plates as an immunosorbent for the purification of specific antibodies does not seem to have been evaluated. In this study, ELISA plates coated with peptides representing short sequences of various antigens from Plasmodium falciparum, the etiologic agent of human malaria, have been successfully used as a means to purify small amounts of the corresponding antibodies. ELISA plates, identical to those used for antibody detection, also permitted the evaluation of various elution conditions for each pairing of peptide and serum we tested four eluting buffers (0.2 M glycine, pH 2.5
