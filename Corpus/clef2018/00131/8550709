Internal pancreatic fistula: surgical treatment. The authors present 13 cases of internal pancreatic fistula, of which 11 were secondary to a chronic pancreatitis and two were caused by an abdominal trauma. Beside the clinical picture, the diagnosis was anticipated by the high amylase levels present in the fluid obtained by paracentesis or thoracocentesis. The diagnosis was confirmed by the radiological analysis of the pancreatic duct system, when an endoscopic retrograde pancreatography was performed in seven patients, one pancreatography was carried out during surgery in five cases, and one patient underwent an injection of hydrosoluble contrast in the pleural cavity. The treatment was a latero-lateral pancreaticojejunoanastomosis in five cases, associated with a corpora-caudal pancreatectomy in four patients a cephalic duodenopancreatectomy was performed in one case. Two patients underwent a cystoenteroanastomosis, while the option chosen in the last four cases was an external drainage. One patient refused to undergo surgical treatment. Operation mortality was null. The conclusion was that an adequate surgical treatment results in the occlusion of the internal pancreatic fistula and, furthermore, allows for the definitive resolution of underlying pancreatic affection.
