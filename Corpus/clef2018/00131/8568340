Leiomyosarcoma of the pancreas. A 45-yr-old female patient was admitted with signs and symptoms of acute pancreatitis. She had no history of gallstones, alcohol, or trauma. Her CT scan was consistent with a cystic lesion of the pancreas. Because of her presenting symptoms and signs, she was initially treated as an acute pancreatitis. Followup CT scan showed absolutely no change in the cyst. Surgical consultation was requested. A diagnosis of a neoplastic cyst was made, and the patient was taken to surgery where a distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy was performed. Pathology revealed a leiomyosarcoma of the pancreas. Only 15 other cases of leiomyosarcoma of the pancreas have been reported thus far in literature.
