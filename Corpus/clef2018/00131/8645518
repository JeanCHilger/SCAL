Sarcoidosis simulating carcinoma of the head of pancreas. Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease of unknown origin with a variable clinical presentation. Although involvement of every organ has been described, the pulmonary system is most frequently involved. Isolated extrapulmonary disease is rare. Hepatic manifestations include granulomatous hepatitis and hilar lymphadenopathy. We describe a case of sarcoidosis initially presenting as extrahepatic jaundice.
