Endoscopic ultrasound: improving GI diagnosis. At present, the technique--which incorporates fiberoptic imaging--is best used for local staging of esophageal, pancreatic, and rectal cancer, characterization of submucosal gastrointestinal masses, and detection of common bile duct stones. Potential uses being investigated include transintestinal fine needle puncture to aspirate lymph nodes or tumors and assistance with various therapies.
