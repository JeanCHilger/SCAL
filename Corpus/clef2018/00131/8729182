Retained contrast after embolization of a right gastric artery pseudoaneurysm. Pseudoaneurysms due to chronic pancreatitis can be a source of major gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage. Computed tomography (CT) is the primary diagnostic imaging modality for pancreatic pseudocysts associated with GI bleeding. Pseudoaneurysms and associated GI bleeding can be diagnosed and embolized with transcatheter techniques once the arterial anatomy is defined. CT is a useful modality for follow-up examination of the pseudocyst the findings must be correlated with other procedures performed on these patients. On follow-up studies, contrast medium retained in the pseudocyst after embolization may falsely signal persistent bleeding into the pseudocyst.
