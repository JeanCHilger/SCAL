Pancreatic pseudocysts in childhood. Pancreatic pseudocysts do not occur frequently in infants, although more cases have been reported in the last years probably due to a more accurate and early diagnosis. These cases have been related to the increasing frequency of blunt abdominal injuries. Half of the four patients presented in this report were found to have suffered from previous blunt abdominal injuries and the common characteristic in all cases was a polymorphic clinical course prior to the discovery of an abdominal mass or progressive abdominal distension. All cases required surgical intervention, including external diversion (marsupialization) in two patients and internal derivation (cystogastrostomy) in the remaining patients. All patients recovered uneventfully after appropriate surgical treatment, although the mean hospital stay in those treated with external drainage was longer. These four cases were observed during a long period of time enabling us to register the variations in diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.
