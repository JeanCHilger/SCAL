Application of simple peptide ELISA for stratification of malaria endemicity. A serological investigation was conducted in north India to determine malaria endemicity based on the antibody levels against a nonapeptide RI (EENVEHDA-Cys) from the P. falciparum antigen Pf 155/RESA. P. falciparum sonicated crude antigen was also used in the study. Subjects of all age groups from various strata of malaria endemicity were included in this study. A total of 4273 finger prick blood samples from 49 villages of five districts were collected during January to March 1991 which is a non-transmission season and the antibody levels were estimated by ELISA. Although a good correlation was found between the antibody titre to the RI peptide and that to the crude antigen, the most consistent results were obtained with the RI peptide. When compared with the annual parasite index (API) values, an established method for defining malaria endemicity, mean anti-RI antibody titres obtained from several villages within a single zone correlated (r = 0.94, p = 0.023) with mean API value of the area. Thus, our results suggest that by using the RI peptide as antigen in seroepidemiology, it is possible to stratify malaria endemicity. We didn't distinguish between endemicity of Pv and Pf since each area experiences cycle of transmission of P. vivax followed by P. falciparum and our sera were from individuals having no fever.
