Detection of pancreatic adenocarcinoma: relative value of arterial and late phases of spiral CT. Spiral computed tomography (CT) allows the pancreas to be imaged during peak contrast levels owing to the capability of fast data acquisition. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relative value of the arterial and late phases of spiral CT for detecting pancreatic adenocarcinomas.Twenty-two patients with pathologically proved pancreatic adenocarcinomas underwent two-phase spiral CT. The CT scans were performed with 5 mm collimation and 5 mm/s table speed. Images during the arterial and late phases were obtained at 30- and 180-second delays, respectively. The images of the arterial phase were compared with those of the late phase in terms of tumor conspicuity from surrounding pancreatic parenchyma and tumor detectability by means of a 3-point grading system: 1 (poor), 2 (fair), and 3 (good).In terms of tumor conspicuity from surrounding pancreatic parenchyma, 16 lesions (73%) were good, 5 lesions (23%) were fair, and 1 lesion (4%) was poor during the arterial phase, whereas 6 lesions (27%) were good, 9 lesions (41%) were fair, and 7 lesions (32%) were poor during the late phase (p = 0.0007). The arterial phase was superior to the late phase in 16 patients (73%) and equal in 6 patients (27%). For tumor detectability, 18 lesions (82%) were good, 3 lesions (14%) were fair, and 1 lesion (4%) was poor during the arterial phase, whereas 10 lesions (45%) were good, 7 lesions (32%) were fair, and 5 lesions (23%) were poor during the late phase (p = 0.0033). For detectability, the arterial phase was superior to the late phase in 14 patients (64%) and equal in 8 patients (36%).The arterial phase of spiral CT is superior to the late phase, which is equivalent to conventional CT for detecting pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
