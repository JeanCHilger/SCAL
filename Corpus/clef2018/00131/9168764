Solitary breast metastasis to the ampulla and distal common bile duct. The indications for pancreaticoduodenectomy have continued to expand over the past 10 to 15 years. This is in large part due to improved diagnostic studies, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticogram and computed tomography, and decreases in hospital perioperative morbidity and mortality. One third of breast cancer patients will develop metastatic disease usually to the liver, lung, or bone (World J Surg 199418:98-111). However, the presentation of painless jaundice due to a single metastatic lesion to the distal common bile duct from ductal adenocarcinoma of the breast is extremely rare. In this case report and review of the literature, we discuss the indications and emerging evidence that pancreaticoduodenectomies can now be performed for localized metastatic disease.
