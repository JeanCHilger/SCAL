Pancreatic trauma: a ten-year multi-institutional experience. Our objective was to determine the incidence, management, and outcome of traumatic pancreatic injury. A retrospective review was performed of all patients with pancreatic injury admitted to two Level I trauma hospitals over a 10-year period. Comparisons were made with Chi square or Fisher's exact tests. Of 16,188 trauma admissions, 72 patients (0.4%) had pancreatic injury. The mean age was 30 years, and 30 patients (69%) were male. Mechanism of injury was gunshot in 32 (45%), blunt in 27 (37%), and stab wound in 13 (18%). The pancreas was involved in 1.1 per cent of patients with penetrating injuries compared to 0.2 per cent with blunt injuries (P < 0.01). There were 18 grade I (25%), 32 grade II (45%), 16 grade III (22%), and 5 grade IV (7%) injuries. Initial diagnosis was made intraoperatively in 63 patients and by computed tomography in 8. The mean injury grade was significantly lower on computed tomography compared to surgical exploration (0.4 vs 2.0 P < 0.05). Operative procedures included distal pancreatectomy in 23 (32%), exploration only in 22 (31%), external drainage in 13 (18%), pancreatorrhaphy in 4, internal drainage in 2, and proximal resection in 2. Mortality was 16.6 per cent and was not related to the mechanism or grade of injury. Mean Injury Severity Score and transfusion requirements were significantly greater in patients who died (P < 0.05). Morbidity occurred in 30 patients (42%), including pancreatic fistula (11%), pancreatitis (7%), and pancreatic pseudocyst (3%). Six patients (8%) developed intra-abdominal abscesses, and all had associated liver or intestinal injuries. In patients with grade I and II injuries, morbidity was higher with external drainage compared to exploration without drainage. Pancreatic injury is infrequent and is more often associated with penetrating trauma. Diagnosis is most commonly made by exploration and cannot be excluded by computed tomography. Drainage of low-grade injuries may not be necessary. Morbidity and mortality in patients with pancreatic trauma is significant and is primarily due to associated injuries.
