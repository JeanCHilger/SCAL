Host choice by indoor-resting Anopheles arabiensis in Ethiopia. The host preference of indoor resting Anopheles arabiensis has been determined using a direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A total of 611 specimens, 258 from human dwellings, 179 from mixed dwellings, and 174 from cattle sheds, was examined. The proportion of human blood meals identified was highest from mosquitoes caught in human dwellings (91.5%), followed by those from mixed dwellings (20.2%) and cattle sheds (3.5%) (P < 0.0001). The smaller proportion of human blood meals from mixed dwellings suggests that cattle may protect humans from A. arabiensis.
