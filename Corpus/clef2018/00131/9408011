Occult cancer in patients with venous thromboembolism: which patients, which cancers. We have previously demonstrated that patients with idiopathic venous thromboembolism (VTE) have a higher frequency of underlying cancer. Now we present a retrospective analysis of our 5-year experience with a series of 674 consecutive otherwise healthy patients, and a more restricted battery of diagnostic tests. Occult cancer was found in 15 patients during admission. The diagnostic tools which led to suspect occult cancer were: abdominal CT-scan (4 patients) high carcinoembryonic levels (2 patients)
