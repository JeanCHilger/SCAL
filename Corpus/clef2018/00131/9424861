Diagnosis of pancreatic neoplasm--possibilities and limitations. 75 consecutive patients treated for pancreatic cancer were submitted to prospective trial. 1 to 12 weeks passed from the onset of symptoms before diagnosis was established. 61 (81%) patients were admitted due to symptoms and 14 (19%)--due to USG findings. Sensitivity and selectivity of imaging techniques was as follows: USG-87% and 73%, ERCP-72% and 72%, CT-100% and 82% respectively. Staging of the lesions estimated by CT (AJCC/TNM scale) 34 patients qualified as stage I, 15 as stage II, 14 as III and 12 as stage IV. Surgery was undertaken in 71 patients and resective procedures in 32 of them (43%). The final diagnosis was established by one biopsy in 21 patients, and in the further 8 cases 2-3 biopsies were necessary. In 3 cases cancer cells were found only during histological examination of the whole resected specimen. The follow up in resected group was 1-30 months. One year survival was 72%, actuarial survival is 38%.
