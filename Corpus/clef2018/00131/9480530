Cystic tumors of the pancreas. Cystic tumors of the pancreas are rare, accounting for only 10 to 15% of cystic lesions of the pancreas and 1% of malignant neoplasms. They can be benign or malignant and well circumscribed and localized. Their identification, the differential diagnosis and treatment are difficult and one example is that up to a third of them may be confused with pseudocysts. The most important are serous microcystic cystadenomas, mucinous cystadenomas, mucinous cystadenocarcinomas, mucin-producing adenocarcinomas and adenocarcinomas associated to pseudocyst or to simple cyst. The most useful studies for diagnosis are ultrasound, computed axial tomography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, guided punction of the cyst with study of the fluid, and biopsy. The choice of the type of treatment depends on the variety of the tumor. The localization and extension, the surgical risk, the experience of the surgeon and the institutional resources. The prognosis of these tumors is better than that of ductal adenocarcinoma, even if they are malignant.
