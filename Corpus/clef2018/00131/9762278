Extension of an acinar cell pancreatic carcinoma with cystic changes invading the Wirsung canal. We report a case of acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas with misleading cystic changes. A 32-year-old woman presented with symptoms suggesting acute pancreatitis on chronic pancreatitis. The abdominal computed tomography and the endoscopic retrograde pancreatography demonstrated hypertrophy of the pancreatic head associated with global dilatation of main pancreatic duct and secondary canals and a 5 cm communicating cyst. A intraductal papillary-mucinous tumor was suggested. Microscopic findings showed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Six months later, a liver metastasis was detected. The microscopic appearance was different, suggesting acinar cell carcinoma, confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Only two other cases of acinar cell carcinoma with cystic component have been reported in the literature.
