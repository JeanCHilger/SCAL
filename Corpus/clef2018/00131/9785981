Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the pancreas with elevated serum CA 19-9 and SPAN-1. A 55-year-old woman was admitted because of progressive jaundice. Blood examination on admission revealed markedly elevated serum levels of CA19-9 and SPAN-1. Abdominal computed tomography revealed a large tumor in the head of the pancreas. Although the patient's jaundice and elevated CA19-9 decreased after percutaneous franshepatic cholangio-drainage, her SPAN-1 level remained elevated. Open biopsy of the pancreatic tumor revealed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (diffuse medium, B cell type), Complete remission was obtained after one course of CHOP therapy. This case suggests that pancreatic tumor with elevated serum CA19-9 and SPAN-1 levels may involve NHL, and may be curable with chemotherapy.
