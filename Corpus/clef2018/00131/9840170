Laparoscopic splenectomy for an inflammatory pseudotumor of the spleen: operative technique and case report. The case of a primary inflammatory pseudotumor of the spleen in a 44 year-old female is herein reported. This lesion is extremely rare, with only 33 cases previously reported. The splenic tumor was preoperatively diagnosed as a hemangioma by the combined modalities of ultrasonography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. A laparoscopic splenectomy was, thus, performed in order to make a final diagnosis. Pathological examination of the mass revealed an inflammatory process. Based on the above findings, a laparoscopic splenectomy is recommended when the tumor is suspected to be benign.
