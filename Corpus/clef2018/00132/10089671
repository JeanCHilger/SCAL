Cystic dystrophy of the duodenal wall in aberrant pancreas. Cystic dystrophy of the duodenal wall developing in heterotopic pancreas is rare. Pancreaticoduodenectomy is usually advocated in cases of symptomatic cystic dystrophy without chronic pancreatitis but little is known about long-term results. We report a case of cystic dystrophy of the duodenum wall developing in heterotopic pancreas responsible for abdominal pain and duodenal obstruction associated with chronic pancreatitis. Pancreaticoduodenectomy allowed complete relief of symptoms. Chronic pancreatitis associated with cystic dystrophy may complicate the choice of appropriate therapy.
