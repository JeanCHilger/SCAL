Ventral pancreatitis defined on MRI. Ventral pancreatitis, pancreatitis localized in the embryologic ventral pancreas, is rare. To date, only three well documented reports of ventral pancreatitis have been reported in the English-language literature. All three were associated with pancreas divisum. This report presents a patient suspected to have ventral pancreatitis on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging.
