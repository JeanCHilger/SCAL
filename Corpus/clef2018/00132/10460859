Computed tomography of the abdomen with multidetector-array CT. The advent of multidetector CT (MDCT) constitutes a quantum leap creating a wealth of new opportunities in medical imaging. However, while the basic principles of spiral CT still apply, we are now challenged to rethink our strategies in planning a CT study to take full advantage of the increased capabilities of MDCT.We report here our preliminary experiences with MDCT for abdominal CT imaging within a 5-month period. During this time, suitable protocols for investigation of the abdomen using MDCT were developed. The capabilities of MDCT allow for tailoring dedicated CT protocols for routine applications as well as for biphasic liver studies and CT angiography of the aorta and abdominal vessels.The speed of MDCT can either be used to reduce the time needed to cover a given volume, or to use narrower beam collimations to increase the resolution of detail along the z-axis and reduce volume averaging. Higher scan speed allows reduction of the amount of contrast material in vascular applications and suppression of motion artifacts. Higher spatial resolution with thinner collimations reduces volume averaging and improves the detection of small hepatic and pancreatic lesions. Detailed analysis of vascular structures and high-quality three-dimensional reformations become feasible. New problems arise from the large amount of data generated by MDCT.MDCT offers a wealth of new opportunities that help us to come to a fast and accurate diagnosis in suspected abdominal disease. Traditional indications for performing CT are reemphasized and new clinical applications can be exploited.
