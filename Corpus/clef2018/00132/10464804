Contrast-enhanced three-dimensional MR portography. Three-dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance (MR) portography with contrast material enhancement is a fast means of evaluating the portal venous system that has some advantages over currently used modalities, such as digital subtraction angiography, helical computed tomography, ultrasonography, and nonenhanced MR angiography with time-of-flight and phase-contrast techniques. With contrast-enhanced 3D MR portography, a first-pass study of the mesenteric vasculature is performed after rapid bolus injection of gadopentetate dimeglumine a 3D fast field echo sequence is used, which can demonstrate the intrahepatic and extrahepatic portal venous system clearly. Repeated sequences after administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine allow separate demonstration of the splanchnic arteries and portomesenteric veins. The images are reconstructed by means of maximum-intensity projection postprocessing, and a subtraction technique can be used to eliminate arterial enhancement and demonstrate portosystemic shunts. The coronal source images simultaneously demonstrate parenchymal lesions of the liver, pancreas, biliary tract, and spleen. This technique is clinically indicated in portosystemic shunt, portal vein thrombosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatobiliary tumor, hepatic vein obstruction, differentiation of splanchnic arterial from portal venous disease, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Its limitations include allergic reactions to contrast media, inappropriate positioning of the 3D acquisition slab, respiratory motion artifacts, and pseudodissection.
