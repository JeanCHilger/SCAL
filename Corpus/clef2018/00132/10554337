Pancreatic Schwannoma: report of a case. We present herein a case of solitary schwannoma of the pancreas and also review 26 previously reported cases from the English and Japanese literature. Primary schwannoma of the pancreas is a rare tumor. A 50-year-old female was discovered to have a large mass in the upper abdomen on ultrasonography. An examination by computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasonography revealed a solid and cystic tumor in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. A distal pancreatectomy with a splenectomy was performed to remove this tumor. A microscopic examination identified the tumor to be situated in the pancreas while it was composed of cells that originated from Schwann cells. Only 26 cases of pancreatic schwannoma have previously been reported in the English and Japanese literature. We describe in detail the characteristic findings based on image analyses, including CT scan, MRI, ultrasonography, and angiography, in these 26 cases.
