Treatment of patients with severe acute necrotizing pancreatitis based on prospective evaluation. To examine the impact of a prospectively applied diagnostic and treatment protocol in patients with severe acute necrotizing pancreatitis.During a 4-year period (1993-1996), 26 patients were treated for necrotizing pancreatitis, as documented by contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT). All patients were prospectively treated by medical means. Patients with persistent systemic inflammatory response syndrome underwent fine-needle aspiration for bacterial cultures. In case of positive results operative intervention was followed, while in negative results the conservative management was continued. Fine-needle aspiration was repeated every 5-7 days if systemic inflammatory response syndrome persisted or worsened. Sixty-five patients hospitalized during the preceding 11 years (1982-1992), when such a treatment was not constantly applied, served as controls.Infected pancreatic necrosis was demonstrated in 7 of the 26 patients (27%) and was treated by open drainage and/or post-operative lavage with a mortality rate of 14.2%. Thirteen patients in whom fine-needle aspiration was not necessary and 6 with negative cultures after fine-needle aspiration (73%) followed conservative treatment and the mortality rate was 5.2%. The total mortality rate of 7.7% was significantly lower than the mortality rate of 26.2% observed in the control group (p = 0.05).Recent evolution made in the management of severe necrotizing acute pancreatitis can lead to better results in the context of a strictly applied treatment protocol. Such protocols may improve mortality and serve as controls in future study.
