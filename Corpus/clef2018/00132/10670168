An undescribed coexistence of a subserosal exophytic gastric leiomyoma with a serous microcystic pancreatic adenoma. We present the case of a 66-year-old woman with complaints of odynophagia but normal gastro-oesophagoscopic findings. On computed tomographic examination, a presumptive diagnosis of a cystic liver tumor and a microcystic pancreatic adenoma was made. Histopathological examination of the hepatic mass, however, revealed a subserosal exophytic gastric leiomyoma. Considerations to avoid the potential pitfall of diagnosing an exogastric leiomyoma as a liver tumor are emphasized. Moreover, the unique association of an exogastric leiomyoma and a serous microcystic pancreatic adenoma is discussed.
