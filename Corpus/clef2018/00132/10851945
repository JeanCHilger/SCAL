Use of magnetic resonance tomography in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal diseases. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a promising method for examination of the gastrointestinal tract. In this article we present the present status and potential of MRI.The review is based on personal experience and selected published, international papers.Magnetic resonance cholangio-pancreatography (MRCP) and MRI of the liver are well documented examinations which are widely performed. These examinations partly replace existing modalities such as CT and ERCP and represent additional possibilities for examining this anatomic area. MRI is not as yet accepted as the standard examination of the pancreas, but it is regarded as comparable to CT. The adrenals may be examined even more accurately with MRI than with CT. MRI examinations of the oesophagus and gastric ventricle seem promising, but it should be said that they are in an early and not well documented phase. MRI of the small and large bowels is not common. With the exception of preoperative staging of rectal cancers, it is still experimental. MR angiography, functional MRI studies and perfusion studies are not yet in common abdominal diseases. We may, however, believe that they will become important diagnostic tools.MRI is rapidly increasing its share of gastrointestinal imaging examinations. This is mainly due to the increased speed of newer machines. The diagnostic quality has improved, and will improve more. It is thus likely that MRI will, in a large amount of abdominal imaging, replace CT, and to some extent other diagnostic modalities. It is, however, not possible to replace CT for emergencies, and we will probably look forward to more and better imaging with more diagnostic modalities in the future.
