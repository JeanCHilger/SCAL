Renal cell carcinoma metastatic to the pancreas: a single-institution series and review of the literature. To present a series of 5 patients with solitary metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) to the pancreas after radical nephrectomy at our institution and review the published reports of this rare event.A retrospective review of the records of 5 patients with histologically confirmed RCC metastatic to the pancreas after radical nephrectomy was performed. A total of 5 patients (4 men, 1 woman) with a median age of 56 years (range 54 to 68) underwent radical nephrectomy for primary RCC. The pathologic stage was Robson I (n = 3) or Robson III (n = 2), with a left-sided tumor occurring in 3 patients and a right-sided tumor in 2 patients. The median interval from nephrectomy to the diagnosis of the pancreatic metastasis was 12 years (range 4 to 15). All patients were symptomatic at presentation, including weight loss (n = 3), abdominal pain (n = 3), early satiety (n = 1), steatorrhea (n = 1), and/or hemosuccus pancreaticus (n = 1).All pancreatic metastases were hypervascular on imaging studies, and surgical removal was accomplished by pancreaticoduodenectomy (n = 3), partial pancreatectomy (n = 1), or subtotal pancreatectomy (n = 1). One patient died of disseminated disease 12 months after pancreatic resection. Two other patients had recurrences in the lung (n = 1) at 5 months or the pancreas/liver (n = 1) at 48 months. Both of these patients underwent a second resection and were disease free at 2 and 12 months afterward. The two remaining patients were disease free at 7 and 24 months after pancreatic resection.RCC is an unpredictable tumor that may demonstrate very late metastases even from early-stage lesions. Aggressive surgical management of isolated pancreatic lesions offers a chance of long-term survival.
