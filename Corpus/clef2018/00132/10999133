Splenic abscess as a complication of acute pancreatitis. Though there is close anatomical proximity between pancreas and the spleen, the involvement of latter is extremely uncommon in acute inflammation of the pancreas. In this report, we present a case of splenic abscess as a complication of acute pancreatitis. The aspirate from the abscess yielded the organism, Klebsiella. We were able to successfully treat this case with percutaneous drainage along with parenteral antibiotics, and we did not have a resort to splenectomy.
