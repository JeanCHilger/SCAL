Multiple small pseudoaneurysms complicating pancreatitis: angiographic diagnosis and transcatheter embolization. We report a case of retroperitoneal hemorrhage due to multiple, small pseudoaneurysms complicating a chronic alcoholic pancreatitis. Cross-sectional imaging with CT and US could not clearly depict these vascular lesions. Selective arteriography of the superior mesenteric and gastroduodenal arteries clearly showed the small pseudoaneurysms and definitive treatment was performed by transcatheter embolization using coils. Eight months after successful embolization, the patient is asymptomatic without any recurrent bleeding.
