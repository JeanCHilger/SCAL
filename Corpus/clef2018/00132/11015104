Safety and long-term efficacy of transduodenal excision for tumors of the ampulla of Vater. Ampullary tumors should be resected because of the high incidence of malignancy and the unreliability of preoperative endoscopic diagnosis. Controversy exists about whether to perform a transduodenal excision (TDE) or a pancreatoduodenectomy. This study evaluated the safety and long-term efficacy of TDE.The records of 21 patients with a pathologic diagnosis of ampullary adenoma who underwent TDE were reviewed. Demographics, symptoms, pathologic findings, and outcomes were analyzed and long-term follow-up was ascertained.Twenty-one patients (mean age, 61 years) underwent TDE. Final pathology showed adenoma in all patients including 1 (5%) with invasive cancer, 2 (9%) with microinvasive cancer, 6 (28%) with high-grade dysplasia, and 1 (5%) with low-grade dysplasia. The overall survival was 85% (mean follow-up of 38 months). One of 3 late deaths was likely related to disease progression. Sixteen of the 18 remaining patients (89%) had no evidence of tumor recurrence. One benign ampullary recurrence was successfully treated endoscopically. One additional patient developed an ampullary cancer and underwent pancreatoduodenectomy.TDE of benign ampullary tumors, even those with varying grades of dysplasia, can be performed with acceptable morbidity and low rates of recurrence. Postoperative endoscopic surveillance is mandatory to identify recurrent tumors.
