Differential diagnosis of pancreatic head cancer. The results of clinical, instrumental and laboratory examinations were analyzed for 99 patients. 59 of them had pancreatic head cancer, 40--chronic pseudotumorous pancreatitis. The importance of complex ultrasonic diagnosis in detection of pancreatic diseases (98%), in true diagnosis of unresectable tumors (96.7%), and also in determination of bile ducts lesion level in obstructive jaundice is shown. It was revealed that spiral computed tomography (SCT) had an advantage over computed tomography in diagnosis of pancreatic tumors and in assessment of their resectability. Sensitivity of combined use of US, SCT and tumor marker CA 19-9 in pancreatic cancer diagnosis increases to 95.2%. High diagnostic value of laparoscopy with laparoscopic ultrasonic examination as a method of final assessment of tumor resectability is shown.
