Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography in assessing the cause of acute pancreatitis in children. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a new noninvasive method of obtaining images of the pancreaticobiliary tract. Recent advances in MR technology and image quality have made it easy to diagnose structural abnormalities of the pancreaticobiliary tract (SAPBT) in children. To examine the usefulness of MRCP in assessing the cause of acute pancreatitis in children, we performed MRCP in 16 patients with acute pancreatitis. The study population was divided into two groups according to the cause of acute pancreatitis as follows: group 1 consisted of seven patients sonographically diagnosed with choledochal cysts and group 2 consisted of nine patients with no obvious cause of acute pancreatitis. Non-breath-hold MRCP using the half-Fourier, single-shot, fast spin-echo imaging method was performed within 7 days after the onset of pancreatitis. Abnormal union of the pancreaticobiliary junction was detected in six of seven group 1 patients and in one of nine group 2 patients. Pancreatic divisum was detected in one patient of group 1, but could not be confirmed in one patient of group 2. Dilatation of the main pancreatic duct was detected in one patient of group 1 and in three patients of group 2. Our results suggest that MRCP is a useful, noninvasive method of identifying and ruling out SAPBT as a cause of acute pancreatitis in children with early-stage pancreatitis.
