Is CT during arterial portography useful for the preoperative evaluation of liver metastases from pancreatic carcinoma? We evaluated computed tomography during arterial portography (CTAP) for the preoperative evaluation of liver metastases from pancreatic carcinoma. Thirty-one patients with invasive ductal carcinoma of the pancreas underwent CTAP for evaluation of liver metastasis. Diagnostic accuracy of CTAP was compared with that of intravenous contrast-enhanced CT (IVCT). In this series, both CTAP and IVCT showed the same diagnostic accuracy for the patients. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and overall accuracy of both CT examinations for detecting liver metastases were 60% (three of five), 100% (26 of 26), 100% (three of three), 93% (26 of 28), and 94% (29 of 31), respectively. CTAP did not confer any advantage over IVCT for the preoperative evaluation of liver metastases from pancreatic carcinoma.
