Congenital anomalies of the pancreaticobiliary tract: findings on MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) using half-Fourier-acquisition single-shot turbo spin-echo sequence (HASTE). The clinical significance of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) using half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin-echo (HASTE) in the evaluation of congenital anomalies of pancreaticobiliary tract was demonstrated in 56 patients (man: 31, women: 25 age: 0-60 years old, mean 15 years old) with suspected congenital anomalies of pancreaticobiliary tract. The image quality and characteristics were assessed. MRCP using HASTE with a phased array coil can be used as a non-invasive method for the evaluation of congenital anomalies of the pancreaticobiliary tracts.
