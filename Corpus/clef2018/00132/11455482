Continuous regional arterial infusion (CRAI) therapy reduces the mortality rate of acute necrotizing pancreatitis: results of a cooperative survey in Japan. We evaluated the usefulness of continuous regional arterial infusion (CRAI) of protease inhibitors and antibiotics in 156 patients with acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP) collected in a cooperative survey carried out in 1997 in Japan. The overall mortality rate was 18.6%, and the frequency of infected pancreatic necrosis was 12.8%. There was no significant difference in mortality rates between patients who received the protease inhibitor via CRAI and the antibiotics intravenously (group A) and patients who received both the protease inhibitor and the antibiotics via CRAI (group B), but the frequency of infected pancreatic necrosis was significantly lower in group B (7.6%) than in group A (23.5%). The mortality rate in patients in whom CRAI therapy was initiated within 48 h after the onset of ANP (11.9%) was significantly lower than that in patients in whom CRAI therapy was initiated more than 48 h after the onset (23.6%). These results suggested that CRAI of both protease inhibitors and antibiotics was effective in reducing mortality and preventing the development of pancreatic infection in ANP when initiated within 48 h after the onset of ANP.
