A case of abnormal pancreaticobiliary junction evidenced by 3D drip infusion cholangiography CT. We report a case of abnormal pancreaticobiliary junction (APBJ), in which three-dimensional (3D) drip infusion cholangiography (DIC) computed tomography (CT) was useful to make the diagnosis. The 3D DIC CT clearly demonstrated reflux of the contrast material into the main pancreatic duct as well as a long common channel, dilated biliary tree, and duodenal lumen. Thereby, we could diagnose APBJ. We believe that 3D DIC CT is a valuable method in the evaluation of patients with suspected APBJ.
