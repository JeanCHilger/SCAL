Cystic dystrophy of heterotopic duodenal pancreas. Cystic dystrophy of heterotopic pancreas is characterized by the presence of cystic formations in the duodenal wall with or without associated pancreatitis. The mechanism by which the cystic dystrophy develops in heterotopic pancreatic pancreas is poorly understood. These lesions are found in young men (40-50 years old) with abusive alcohol intake. The patients are referred for suspected pancreatic neoplasm or for acute pancreatitis. Endoscopic ultrasonography features allow preoperative diagnosis. First line, treatment is medical with parenteral nutrition and octreotide. Then, if the lesions are complicated, surgery (pancreatoduodenectomy or bypass procedure) is indicated.
