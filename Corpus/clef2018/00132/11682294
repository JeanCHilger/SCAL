The role of MRI in the intestinal complications in cystic fibrosis. Fibrosing colonopathy is a complication recently detected in children with cystic fibrosis (CF), and is thought to be associated with the use of high-strength pancreatic enzymes. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of magnetic resonance (MR) in detecting possible pathologic gut findings in patients with CF under pancreatic enzyme treatment. Twenty-five patients with CF and pancreatic insufficiency, all under treatment with high-dose pancreatic enzymes, were studied by MR. MR was performed on a 1.5-T magnet by T1-weighted, 2D-FLASH fat-suppression, breath-hold sequences before and after intravenous administration of gadolinium, and by T2-weighted Turbo Spin-Echo (TSE) and Half-Fourier Acquisition Single-Shot Turbo Spin Echo (HASTE) fat-suppression, breath-hold sequences. A superparamagnetic negative oral contrast agent was given 1.5 h before the examination. MR showed a wall thickening of the terminal ileum and the ascending colon (>4-12 mm) in 22 patients nine of them (wall thickness >4-6 mm) showed both a moderate hyperintensity of the bowel wall on T2-weighted sequences and an enhancement after intravenous gadolinium on T1-weighted sequences
