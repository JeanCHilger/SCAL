A case of hemosuccus pancreaticus associated with hereditary pancreatitis. We report a 25-year-old male with hemosuccus pancreaticus associated with hereditary pancreatitis. He was originally diagnosed as having familial chronic pancreatitis at the age of 12, because his brother was also diagnosed as having pancreatitis. No history of pancreatitis was found in their parents. The patient was admitted because of a growing pancreatic pseudocyst. While he had undergone conservative treatment for the pseudocyst, computed tomography incidentally revealed a pancreatic pseudoaneurysm. Endoscopic examination revealed spontaneous bleeding from the major papilla. Interventional embolization was successfully performed. An R122H mutation in the cationic trypsinogen gene was identified in this patient, his brother, and his mother, indicating that they have hereditary pancreatitis. To our knowledge, this is the first report of hemosuccus pancreaticus associated with hereditary pancreatitis. Mutational screening is useful for the diagnosis of hereditary pancreatitis, especially in patients whose diagnosis is inconclusive based on the traditional clinical criteria.
