A case of disseminated tuberculosis requiring extended period for the identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis on culture. A 80-year-old male visited an outpatient department of a nearby hospital complaining of fever, cough, and poor appetite on June 2000. The patient was diagnosed as bacterial pneumonia and was treated with antibiotics although specific cause could not be identified. After one month, he was hospitalized due to lack of improvement. After admission, acid-fast bacilli (AFB) was found from the bronchial washing. The patient was then transferred to our hospital. Upon admission, sputum smear examination was positive for AFB and MTB was confirmed by PCR. Therapy was initiated with INH 300 mg, RFP 450 mg, EB 1000 mg, and PZA 1000 mg, orally daily. However, on the day following the admission, he became unconscious. Brain MRI showed several small granulomas on the cortex of the bilateral anterior and temporal brain. Although AFB was not detected from the cerebrospinal fluid, tuberculous meningitis was suspected and steroid was given. Nine days after admission, the patient died due to tuberculous meningitis. The isolation of MTB had been attempted on Ogawa culture medium using patient's sputum and liquor, and it took 14 weeks to find colony growth both from sputum and liquor. In the autopsy, numerous granulomas were detected in his lung, liver, kidney, and pancreas. These findings indicate that disseminated growth of MTB occurred in vivo in spite of very slow growth of MTB in vitro.
