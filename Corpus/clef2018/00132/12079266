ERCP and MRCP--when and why. Since the introduction of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in the 1970s, gastroenterologists have a wide spectrum of diagnostic and therapeutic options in the biliopancreatic ductal system at their disposal. With its arrival in the 1990s, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) developed as a potent diagnostic tool in biliopancreatic pathology. Currently, MRCP is widely replacing diagnostic ERCP and thereby avoiding complications related to endoscopic technique.We summarize evidence-based data and demonstrate indications and differential indications for MRCP and ERCP in pancreatic disease. Complications related to the procedures and possible medical prevention are discussed. The feasibility of interventional endoscopy in pancreatic disease is reported in detail. The role of gastroenterologists in performing MRCP is outlined on the basis of practical examples.
