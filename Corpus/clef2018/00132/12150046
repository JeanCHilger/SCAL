Pfeifer-Weber-Christian's panniculitis in an obese patient with antinuclear antibody-positive leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Pfeifer-Weber-Christian's panniculitis is a rare syndrome characterized by fever, arthralgias, fatigue and recurrent nodular panniculitis. It has been associated with pancreatic diseases, trauma, connective tissue diseases, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, systemic lupus erythematosus, infections, lymphoproliferative diseases and neoplasias. We report the case of a 43-year-old obese male patient who presented with asthenia, arthralgias, intermittent fever, skin erythema and a large hard-elastic tumor of the right calf. Laboratory analysis revealed increased values of the immunophlogosis parameters and positivity for serum antinuclear antibodies. Surgical drainage of the abscess-like tumor mass, revealed leakage of a sterile, subflavious, oily and thick liquid a skin biopsy showed intra and perivascular infiltration by neutrophils, diagnostic for leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Treatment with prednisone induced clinical improvement and normalization of the laboratory data. The clinical picture, laboratory data and efficacy of prednisone therapy confirmed that the patient developed Pfeifer-Weber-Christian's panniculitis in the clinical setting of an antinuclear antibody-positive leukocytoclastic vasculitis.
