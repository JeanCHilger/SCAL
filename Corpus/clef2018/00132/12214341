Solid-cystic pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas: acute post-traumatic presentation. Case report and review of the literature. To report an infrequent case of pancreatic pseudopapillary solid-cyst tumor, known as Frantz tumor, discovered after blunt abdominal trauma, and to carry out a review of the literature.Frantz's tumor is a very uncommon low-grade malignant papillary-cystic neoplasm of the pancreas that is relatively frequent in young black women and was first described by Frantz in 1959.We present the case of a 15-years-old female patient who, 24 h after blunt abdominal trauma, came to the emergency room with intense abdominal and atypical pain and a palpable mass in the left upper quadrant. It was initially diagnosed as a post-traumatic pancreatic pseudocyst. The patient underwent distal pancreatectomy with spleen preservation the histopathologic report was a pseudopapillary solid and cystic tumor of the pancreas without malignant cells. Clinical evolution has been satisfactory without recurrence of the tumor at 14 months of follow-up.Frantz's tumor has benign biologic behavior and treatment of choice consists of surgical resection. Outcome after surgical resection is excellent with 90% survival in the long term. Tumoral recurrence has been described in approximately 10% of patients.
