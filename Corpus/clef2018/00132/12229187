A case of liposarcoma of the renal capsule. A 58-year-old woman was referred to our institution for treatment of a left renal tumor revealed by follow-up computed tomography (CT) of a pancreatic tumor. The CT showed a heterogeneous, perirenal mass containing areas of fat density. Angiography showed no feeding artery. Left nephrectomy was performed and pathological examination revealed a well-differentiated liposarcoma of the renal capsule. At the third-month follow-up, the patient was completely asymptomatic and free of recurrence. Primary tumors of the renal capsule are uncommon and liposarcoma of the renal capsule is distinctly rare. There have been only 17 reports of liposarcoma arising from the renal capsule in Japan. We, herein, report a case of liposarcoma of the renal capsule.
