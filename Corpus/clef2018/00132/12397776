Pancreatic arteriovenous malformation treated by transcatheter embolization. Arteriovenous malformation of the pancreas is a rare condition that may cause upper gastrointestinal bleeding. A 58-year-old man with an arteriovenous malformation of the pancreas is described. The patient had recurrent episodes of melena. The diagnosis was confirmed by angiographic study and color Doppler ultrasonography. Therapeutic embolization of the arteriovenous malformation was successfully carried out. In conclusion, transcatheter arterial embolization should be chosen for the patient with the pancreatic arteriovenous malformation.
