Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas: CT imaging. CT currently plays a vital role in pancreatic cancer staging. Continued advancements in computers, scanner technology, and 3D software have improved CT detection of smaller masses and staging. In particular, the introduction of MDCT and real-time 3D volume-rendering software have greatly improved the visualization of the pancreas and adjacent vasculature. This progress will continue as manufacturers introduce the next generation of scanners, which can acquire up to 32 slices per second with ever faster scan times. The impact of these new scanners on diagnostic accuracy will need to be carefully evaluated.
