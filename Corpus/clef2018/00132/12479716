MR cholangiopancreatography. In summary, over the past decade, MRCP has evolved not only as a feasible means of noninvasively evaluating the pancreaticobiliary tract but also as a technique with documented clinical utility. With the evolution of MRCP, there has been, by necessity, an evolution of ERCP. In fact, at some institutions MRCP has replaced diagnostic ERCP such that ERCP is reserved primarily for therapeutic interventions. When MRCP is performed in conjunction with abdominal MR and MRA, a comprehensive examination results that permits evaluation of the solid organs and vessels of the abdomen as well as the ductal systems.
