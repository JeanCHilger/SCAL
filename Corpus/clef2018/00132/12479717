Endoscopic ultrasonography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography imaging for pancreaticobiliary pathology: the gastroenterologist's perspective. With advances in noninvasive radiologic technology, additional adjunctive techniques are developing, and the roles for ERCP and EUS are continuously changing. In a diagnostic setting, ERCP is currently best reserved for patients with a high likelihood of needing endoscopic therapy, and EUS is especially useful for cases in which other imaging techniques have been inconclusive or are of inferior diagnostic capability. In a therapeutic setting, ERCP and EUS retain important roles in the management of both benign and malignant pancreatic and biliary disease. Certainly, technological advances also directly affect these modalities and expanded applications for ERCP and EUS for the pancreas and biliary tract are anticipated.
