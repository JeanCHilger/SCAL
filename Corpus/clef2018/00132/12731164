Injuries to the duodenum and pancreas in 42 operated cases. 42 consecutive patients who sustained injuries to the duodenum or/and pancreas were admitted to our hospital. Over a twenty year period 32 blunt injuries and 10 penetrating injuries were encountered. Penetrating injuries were always suspected and treated by time: following blunt injury diagnostic delay was encountered in 14 patients and insufficient surgical procedure because of intra-operative misinterpretation in 2 patients. Most of the patients had associated intra-abdominal organ injuries. Adjusts to diagnosis such as abdominal roentgenograms, serum amylase levels and gastroduodenography was not helpful. CT scan and ultrasound allowed to confirm the suspected diagnosis in 3 cases only. Intraoperative diagnosis was also challenging. Complete mobilization of the strictures surrounding the duodenum and the pancreas to provide entire exposure was necessary in 12 patients treated first in a peripheral hospital, diagnosis of the injury have been missed at first laparotomy and reoperation was necessary in all of them. Suture closure of the duodenum and drainage of the pancreatic region wee the most common reparative techniques used. More complicated procedures with pancreatic and/or duodenal resection were performed in 12 patients. Overall mortality in patients surviving more than 24 hours was 14%. Suture live dehiscence after delayed operation (4) and 2 deaths due to brain injury.
