Vascular involvement in pancreatic neoplasm: a comparison between spiral CT and DSA. The principal criterion for resectability of pancreatic carcinoma is the assessment of vascular involvement. In a prospective evaluation the ability of Spiral CT Angiography (CTA) to detect vascular involvement in 50 patients with pancreatic carcinoma, was proved DSA was performed later in all patients. In 20 patients, without vascular involvement, a complete concordance was obtained. Of 30 patients with vascular involvement, there was complete concordance between CTA and angiography in 22 patients and discordance in 8 patients. CTA was superior in 2 cases with periadventitial infiltration and in 5 patients with splenoportal confluence thrombosis. DSA was superior in 1 case with infiltration of the superior mesenteric vein. After surgical evaluation, sensitivity of CTA and DSA was 97% and 77%, respectively, and the negative predictive values were 95% and 74%. As compared to DSA, CTA is more rapid and less invasive and can be considered the modality of choice for preoperative work-up of pancreatic neoplasm.
