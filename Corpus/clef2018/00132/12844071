Multidetector CT and MRI in pancreatic diseases. Multidetector CT and MRI are the most efficient non invasive techniques in the assessment of pancreatic diseases. As with MRI, multidetector CT has now become an  all in one  examination using 2 D and 3 D multiplanar reformations with the ability to perform with high accuracy: a) vascular assessment using MIP reconstruction and b) biliary and pancreatic ducts assessment using minIP reconstruction. This review compares and illustrates the respective advantages of MRI and multidetector CT in the assessment of pancreatic diseases.
