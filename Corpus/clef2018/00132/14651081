Cystic insulinoma of the pancreas in a patient with myotonic dystrophy: correlation of imaging and pathologic findings. We present a case of cystic islet cell tumor of the pancreas in a 60-year old male with myotonic dystrophy. A cystic lesion was found with a thick peripheral rim, a few intralesional septae and a fluid-debris level on CT and MRI. Image characteristics are compared with the pathological findings. MRI demonstrated the internal architecture of the lesion more clearly.
