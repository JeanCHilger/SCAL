Atypical presentation of chronic pancreatic fistula: a case successfully managed with long-acting somatostatin. Pancreatic fistula is a potential complication of trauma or inflammation of the pancreatic duct or accessory pancreatic ducts. These fistulous tracts tend to form external to the pancreas internal cases are rare. Pharmacological inhibition of pancreatic exocrine secretion and conservative approaches such as percutaneous endoscopic interventions are widely used to treat pancreatic fistulae. However, these fistulae are still associated with significant mortality and morbidity. In this report, we describe a case with post-splenectomy pancreatic fistulae and related recurrent abdominal abscess who was successfully managed with long-acting somatostatin.
