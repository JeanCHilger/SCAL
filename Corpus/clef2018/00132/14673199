Serous oligocystic adenoma of the pancreas. Cystic neoplasms of the pancreas are uncommon lesions but are becoming increasingly prevalent. Herein we report a case of an oligolocular cystic lesion in the head of the pancreas in a young female that had undergone a cystenteroanastomosis 10 years ago. She underwent a duodenopancreatectomy with an uneventful recovery. The histology showed a serous oligocystic adenoma of the pancreas and the immunohistochemistry study confirmed the diagnosis. There is no sign of recurrence after the surgery. The role of pre-operative diagnosis based on tomographic, echoendoscopy and fine needle aspiration are discussed.
