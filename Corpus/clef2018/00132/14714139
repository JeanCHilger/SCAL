Phase-inversion tissue harmonic imaging compared with conventional B-mode ultrasound in the evaluation of pancreatic lesions. The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and image quality of conventional B-mode US (BM) and phase-inversion tissue harmonic imaging (PTHI) regarding pancreatic pathology. In a prospective study, 107 patients, aged between 28 and 85 years, underwent US examinations of the pancreas with both BM and PTHI in a randomly chosen order. As diagnostic reference, either contrast-enhanced CT or MRI examinations of the upper abdomen were obtained in all patients. Sensitivity and specificity were evaluated using the Student's t test. Differences in overall image quality, lesion conspicuity, fluid-solid differentiation, and delineation of the pancreatic tail were analyzed using Wilcoxon's signed ranks test and Bowker's symmetry test. Sixteen of 107 examined patients (15%) were non-diagnostic and excluded due to technical limitations such as abdominal gas. A total of 60 pancreatic lesions (cysts, acute pancreatitis, dilatation of the pancreatic duct, calcifications, and solid tumors) were diagnosed by CT or MRI. Phase-inversion tissue harmonic imaging had a higher sensitivity of 70% (14 of 20) than BM (60% 24 of 40) for the detection of pancreatic lesions
