Pseudoaneurysm of the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery, a rare cause of hemosuccus pancreaticus: report of a case. Chronic pancreatitis with a pseudoaneurysm is an established cause of hemosuccus pancreaticus. We herein describe a patient with chronic alcoholic pancreatitis associated with hemosuccus pancreaticus due to a pseudoaneurysm of the anterior superior pancreaticoduodenal artery rupturing in a pseudocyst of pancreas in the head region. Angiographic embolization was unsuccessful and therefore a laparotomy, ligation, and excision of the pseudoaneurysm with external drainage of pseudocyst were performed. Hemosuccus pancreaticus is a rare cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography and angiography is diagnostic in the majority of the cases. Surgery is the treatment of choice. Selective angiographic embolization may be helpful in tiding over the emergency until surgery can be performed.
