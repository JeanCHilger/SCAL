Acute pancreatitis: radiologic evaluation. In the acute pancreatitis computerized tomography (CT) is within all radiological technics the method with the highest diagnostic rate. CT allows a detailed analysis of the extent and nature of lesions related to acute pancreatitis, and that from the thorax to the pelvis. It is possible to grade the severity of pancreatitis on the base of its morphological changes within the gland itself and in the extraglandular spread. The differentiation between edema and necrosis is discussed as well as their evolution and the complications appearing during this disease. Percutaneous diagnostic and therapeutic procedures under CT guidance are quite helpful. The prognostic value of CT in the early stage of acute pancreatitis is demonstrated with a clinical-radiological study including 202 patients.
