Immunoblastic large B-cell lymphoma of the peripancreatic head region: MR findings. We report the magnetic resonance (MR) appearance of a large B-cell lymphoma in the peripancreatic head region, in a 38-year-old male who presented with a 1-month history of pruritus and jaundice. Routine laboratory examination at presentation revealed an elevated bilirubin. The tumor was a large, solitary well-defined mass with no evidence of necrosis, which showed mild diffuse heterogeneous enhancement. The tumor was closely applied to the lateral margin of the head of the pancreas. The constellation of MR findings was interpreted as consistent with the correct eventual diagnosis of lymphoma.
