Sonographic controlled drainage of a fluid formation of the spleen in combination with pancreatitis. With regard to acute or chronic pancreatitis various complications involving the spleen can occur, hematoma of the spleen being a rare complication. We describe the case of a patient in reduced general condition with elevated pancreatic enzymes and signs of inflammation. During multiple examinations, hematoma of the spleen, as well as hematomas close to the left adrenal gland and a larger hematoma close to the gastric wall were detected. In computed tomography and due to the laboratory parameters a pancreatitis was diagnosed. After CT-controlled puncture a communication between both formations was considered possible which was in retrospect CT-assisted not successful. Subsequently an ultrasound controlled drainage was performed, finally resulting in a restitutio ad integrum, thereby avoiding splenectomy. The described percutaneous puncture of a fluid formation in the splenic area represents a non-surgical option in the therapy of intrasplenic pancreatic fluid formations.
