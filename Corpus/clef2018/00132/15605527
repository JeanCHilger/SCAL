Mirizzi's syndrome. Evaluation of 3 cases. Evaluation of three cases of Mirizzi's syndrome (MS), a rare condition of non neoplastic biliary tree obstruction.We reviewed three cases of MS, operated from July 1998 to December 2000 in our institution. All patients were preoperatively evaluated by clinical examination, Ultrasound (US) and Endoscopic retrograde colangiopancreatography (CPRE) for jaundice. Computed Tomography (TC) was also performed in two.Abdominal pain was the main symptom in two patients, jaundice in one (17 mg/dl) Courvoisier-Terrier sign, suggestive for a biliopancreatic neoplasm, was present in two patients. US was sensitive for gallbladder stones and biliary tree dilatation but not specific for MSMirizzi's syndrome is a rare condition, but surgeons must be aware of it, particularly in the laparoscopic era were dissection of the Calot triangle may lead to a damage of the hepatic duct. Suspect of MS is mandatory in all cases of jaundice with non neoplastic biliary obstruction. Preoperative diagnosis of MS is not easy US is sensitive for gallbladder stone and biliary tree dilatation, but not specific for choledochal stone compression and biliobiliary fistula. TC is useful for exclusion of pancreatic or liver neoplasms but is non specific for MS. CPRE represents the "gold" standard for MS, showing the hepatic duct compression caused by the stone impacted in gallbladder neck. CPRE is not only diagnostic but also operativeMirizzi syndrome is a rare condition, but surgeons must be aware of it. Surgical approach to MS in the "laparoscopic era" may be complicated by the presence of a colecysto-biliary fistula in these cases dissection of the Calot triangle may difficult or impossible. When a MS is suspected the "open" approach is preferable, also for the reconstruction of biliary tree. CPRE is the most important diagnostic tool, showing the stone compressing the biliary tree.
