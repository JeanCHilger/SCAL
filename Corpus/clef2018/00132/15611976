Bronchopulmonary carcinoid in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) is an autosomal-dominant syndrome associated with neoplasia of pituitary, pancreas, parathyroid, and foregut lineage neuroendocrine tissue. Although enteropancreatic carcinoid has been well described in patients with MEN 1, it was believed that bronchopulmonary carcinoid was relatively uncommon, occurring in approximately 5% of patients. It is unclear whether the increased screening of asymptomatic patients with MEN 1 will facilitate early diagnosis of this tumor and improve patient prognosis.The authors reviewed the patient records and, when available, thoracic computed tomographic (CT) images of 129 MEN 1-affected adult members of a single family to determine the prevalence and prognosis of bronchopulmonary nodules and carcinoid.Among 129 patients, a diagnosis of bronchopulmonary carcinoid was noted in the records for 6 individuals (1 male and 5 females 5%). Thoracic CT scans also were available for review from 32 of those patients. Twelve patients (38%) had pulmonary nodules evident on CT scans. Only hypergastrinemia was significantly more common in patients with pulmonary nodulesThe findings suggested that bronchopulmonary carcinoid is more prevalent in patients with MEN 1 than was recognized previously. Furthermore, the diagnosis did not appear to portend a poor prognosis in the majority of affected patients.
