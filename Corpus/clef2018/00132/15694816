Osteoclast-like giant cell tumor of the liver: a rare neoplasm with an aggressive clinical course. Osteoclast-like giant cell tumors (OCGTs) usually involve the bone and rarely affect the alimentary tract. Within the gastrointestinal tract the liver has been one of the most infrequently reported locations for this neoplasm to occur. In this article we report the occurrence of an OCGT arising in the liver of a 61-year-old woman. The patient presented with abdominal pain and a rapidly enlarging hepatic mass. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated a multilocular solid lesion in the right lobe of the liver. A small extrahepatic lobulation at the lateral aspect of the lesion with penetration of the capsule was visible. Local extension into adjacent organs was not evident. Positron emission tomography (PET) did not indicate a tumor in the pancreas or elsewhere in the body. The tumor was removed by performing a formal right hepatic lobectomy. Histologic and immunohistochemical examinations revealed an OCGT. Within 3 months of the hemihepatectomy, widespread intraabdominal and pulmonary metastasis developed and the patient succumbed to her illness shortly thereafter. This report contributes further evidence to the aggressive biological behavior with regard to this rare neoplasm. The absence of metastatic disease indicated when using magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography does not seem to change the overall dismal prognosis of this tumor.
