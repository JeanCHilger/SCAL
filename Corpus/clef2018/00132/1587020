Annular pancreas and intermittent duodenal obstruction in an alcoholic adult. Annular pancreas is a congenital anomaly which, though present at birth, may cause few symptoms until adulthood. A case of annular pancreas with intermittent duodenal obstruction is described in a 49-year-old alcoholic man. Few other entities cause such obstruction. In similar cases, clinical suspicion of annular pancreas may lead to prompt diagnosis and treatment.
