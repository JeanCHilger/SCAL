Solid cystic pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas. Solid-cystic-pseudopapillary tumor (SCPT) of the pancreas, described by Frantz (1959), is a very rare clinical pathologic entity with relatively low grade malignant potential. The tumor is more frequent in the body and tail of the pancreas. The majority of patients are young females. About 60% of patients are asymptomatic. Complications such as rupture, bleeding or secondary infections are rare. Metastases of the tumor and local recurrence after surgical treatment are also rare. Prognosis is excellent after complete surgical removal. It is difficult to make a preoperative diagnosis of pancreatic SCPT. The exact diagnosis is based on histological findings. Differential diagnosis should consider pancreatoblastoma, non neoplastic cysts, pancreatic pseudo-cysts and hydatid cyst. This is a case report of 39-year old woman who was admitted to our institution with abdominal discomfort and palpable abdominal mass in the upper abdomen. US and CT scan revealed round neoformation of 60 mm in diameter located in the body of the pancreas. Imaging features were not specific enough to allow for precise diagnosis. Curative R0 left spleno-hemipancreatectomy was performed. Histology of the resected specimen revealed solid and cystic-pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 7 in a good condition. The patient is well 48 months after the operation, with no impairment of pancreatic endocrine or exocrine function.
