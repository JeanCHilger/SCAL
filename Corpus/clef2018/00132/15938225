Hydatid cyst of the pancreas. Hydatid cyst of the pancreas is rare. During the last 30 years, less than 40 cases have been reported in journals on Medline. This is a case report of a 35-year old woman with 2-year history of epigastric pain in whom an ultrasound and computed tomography showed the cyst of the body and tail of the pancreas 6x7 cm in diameters, which was supposed to be hydatid one. During surgery, an isolated hydatid cyst of the pancreas was found without communication with the pancreatic duct. The content of the cyst was removed, and pericyst was partially excised and drained. The recovery was uneventful and the patient has remained symptom free so far. Although rare, hydatid cyst should be considered in the differential diagnosis of the cystic lesions of the pancreas, particularly in patients coming from endemic areas and without history of pancreatitis.
