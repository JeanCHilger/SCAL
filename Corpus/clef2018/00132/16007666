Fine-needle aspiration cytology of pancreatic somatostatinoma: the importance of immunohistochemistry for the cytologic diagnosis of pancreatic endocrine neoplasms. Pancreatic somatostatinoma is a rare pancreatic endocrine neoplasm representing as little as 1% of pancreatic endocrine neoplasms (PENs). The histologic features of this tumor are like those of other PENs, except that it commonly forms acinar structures and often has cells with abundant, granular cytoplasm. We have recently encountered two of these neoplasms sampled by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA). We discuss the cytologic and immunohistochemical findings of these two cases and the cytologic similarities these neoplasms share with pancreatic acinar-cell carcinoma (PACC). We review the cytologic features of PEN and PACC and discuss the importance of cell block immunohistochemistry in the diagnosis of pancreatic neoplasia sampled by EUS-guided FNA.
