Double localization of pancreatic insulinoma. Diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties. Insulinomas are the most common cause of hypoglycemia resulting from endogenous hyperinsulinism. Because most of insulinomas are less than 2 cm in size and rarely they not may be visible by CT scan or transabdominal ultrasonography. Intraoperative ultrasonography may be a solution. Although as surgical method is preferred enucleation because operative time is shorter and easier and the low frequency postoperative complications, pancreaticoduodenectomy Whipple is indicated in selected cases. We report a case of double insulinoma located in the head of the pancreas in which the diagnosis and surgical treatment presented difficulties which determined a particular clinical evolution.
