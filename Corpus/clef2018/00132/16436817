Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of pancreas: multi-detector row CT with 2D curved reformations--correlation with MRCP. To retrospectively compare accuracy of multi-detector row computed tomography (CT), combined with two-dimensional (2D) curved reformations, and that of magnetic resonance (MR) cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) for characterization of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) as malignant, with pathologic examination as reference standard.Institutional review board approval was obtained, informed consent was waived, and study was HIPAA compliant. Twenty-five patients (12 women, 13 men age range, 44-88 years) with pathologically proved IPMN were examined with dual-phase CT with 1.25-mm-thick sections for pancreatic phaseExcellent correlation between modalities was observed. Cyst communication was seen in 20 and 21 of 24 branch pancreatic duct (BPD) IPMNs with CT and MRCP, respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for detection of malignancy were 70%, 87%, and 76% (CT) and 70%, 92%, and 80% (MRCP), respectively. Interobserver agreement was good to perfect for both readers in all comparisons (overall, kappa = 0.70-1.00).CT combined with 2D curved reformation can provide imaging details of IPMN, including communication of BPD IPMN with MPD, that are almost equivalent to those provided at MRCP. Presence of mural nodules, dilated MPD (>10-mm diameter), or thick septa at CT or MRCP may be used as independent predictors of malignancy.
