Purtscher-like retinopathy associated with acute pancreatitis. Purtscher-like retinopathy with bilateral loss of vision is a rare and severe complication that may follow acute pancreatitis.The case of a 35-year-old patient with acute alcoholic pancreatitis who developed sudden loss of visual acuity is described. The ophthalmoscopic examination revealed diffuse retinal whitening of the posterior pole with confluent cotton-wool spots. Fluorescein angiogram showed retinal arteriolar occlusion. The findings were compatible with Purtscher-like retinopathy. Computed tomography of the abdomen demonstrated enlarged liver and pancreas with edema and inflammation. The pathogenesis of this form of retinopathy still remains uncertain and there is no specific treatment available.
