The new role for endoscopic ultrasound in endocrinology: imaging of the adrenals and the endocrine pancreas. Endoscopic ultrasound imaging of the adrenals and the endocrine pancreas enriches the diagnostic repertoire and improves the clinical opportunities of endocrinology. Its resolution enables detection of tumors as small as 2-3 mm. Endoscopic ultrasound imaging is especially relevant in the diagnosis of insulinomas and primary hyperaldosteronism, because it has direct consequences in planning a diagnostic and therapeutic strategy.
