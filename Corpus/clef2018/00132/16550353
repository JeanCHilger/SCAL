Diagnostic value of curved multiplanar reformatted images in multislice CT for the detection of resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The purpose of this study was to assess the usefulness of curved multiplanar reformatted (MPR) images obtained by multislice CT for the depiction of the main pancreatic duct (MPD) and detection of resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. This study included 28 patients with pancreatic carcinoma (size range 12-40 mm) and 22 without. Curved MPR images with 0.5-mm continuous slices were generated along the long axis of the pancreas from pancreatic-phase images with a 0.5- or 1-mm slice thickness. Seven blinded readers independently interpreted three sets of images (axial images, curved MPR images, and both axial and curved MPR images) in scrolling mode. The depiction of the MPD and the diagnostic performance for the detection of carcinoma were statistically compared among these images. MPR images were significantly superior to axial images in depicting the MPD, and the use of both axial and MPR images resulted in further significant improvements. For the detection of carcinoma, MPR images were equivalent to axial images, and the diagnostic performance was significantly improved by the use of both axial and MPR images. High-resolution curved MPR images can improve the depiction of the MPD and the diagnostic performance for the detection of carcinoma compared with axial images alone.
