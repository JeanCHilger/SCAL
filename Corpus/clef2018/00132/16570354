Mangafodipir trisodium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging for evaluation of pancreatic mass and mass-like lesions. To investigate the role of mangafodipir trisodium (MnDPDP) in focal pancreatic masses and mass-like lesions by evaluating contrast uptake features of the lesions and pancreatic parenchyma after contrast medium injection.A total of 37 patients with pancreatic mass or mass-like lesions were examined by unenhanced and MnDPDP-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).MRI was obtained 20-40 min after infusion of MnDPDP and homogeneous contrast enhancement was observed in normal pancreas parenchyma. In patients with atrophic pancreas there was no enhancement in pancreatic parenchyma on MnDPDP-enhanced MRI. In 37 patients with 41 pancreatic masses and mass-like lesions, contrast enhancement was observed at 5 lesions on MnDPDP enhanced MRI. Three of these 5 lesions were focal pancreatitis and the other 2 were adenocarcinoma. No contrast enhancement was determined in 36 pancreatic masses and mass-like lesions in 32 patients.MnDPDP contrast-enhanced MRI, especially in cases with no parenchyma atrophy, can distinguish focal pancreatic lesion margins. Information about the function of pancreatic parenchyma can be obtained out of tumor. MnDPDP facilitates staging of pancreatic tumors by detection of metastatic lesions in the liver. In addition, diminished heteregenous uptake of MnDPDP in patients with pancreatitis may be helpful in differential diagnosis.
