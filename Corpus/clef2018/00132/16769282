Pancreatic pseudocyst bleeding associated with massive intraperitoneal hemorrhage. Pancreatic pseudocyst bleeding is an unusual entity of acute abdomen, usually occurring among alcoholics. A high mortality developed in patients with conservative treatment of hemorrhagic pancreatic pseudocyst. We report a 37-year-old male with a pseudoaneurysm in the tail of the pancreas presenting with sudden onset of abdominal pain and swelling. Emergency laparotomy after blood transfusion and fluid resuscitation was successfully performed.An abdominal radiography showed multiple calcifications in the epigastric area. Computed tomography of the abdomen showed a cystic lesion with a calcified wall in the tail of the pancreas and a large amount of ascites. After contrast enhancement, there was hemorrhage into the pancreatic pseudocyst with extravasation of contrast into the peritoneal cavity.At operation, active bleeding was noted from a ruptured pseudocyst in the tail of the pancreas and ligation of the bleeding vessel was done.Hemorrhage into the pancreatic pseudocyst associated with intraperitoneal bleeding is a potentially life threatening condition. Emergency surgical treatment should be carried out as soon as possible.
