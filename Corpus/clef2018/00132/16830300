Diagnostic difficulties in peripancreatic tuberculous lymphadenitis: a case report. Peripancreatic tuberculosis involving the lymph node is rarely seen. In this paper, a case is presented and the literature reviewed. A 28-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of pain in the epigastric region, weakness and malaise. Ultrasound and computed tomography scan revealed a mass near the head of the pancreas. The patient was explored for diagnosis. A peripancreatic mass was found adherent to the pancreatic capsule and the frozen section of the mass was reported as lymphadenopathy. The mass was resected totally. Histopathologically, the diagnosis was peripancreatic tuberculous lymphadenitis. She was prescribed antituberculous drugs for one year.
