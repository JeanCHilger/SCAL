Complications of nonoperative management of pediatric blunt hepatic injury: Diagnosis, management, and outcomes. Nonoperative management (NOM) of blunt hepatic injury is the standard of care in the hemodynamically stable pediatric patient, but it is not without pitfalls. The purpose of this study is to assess the incidence and types of complications associated with NOM in terms of diagnosis, management, and outcomes.A retrospective study of pediatric patients with blunt hepatic injuries admitted from 1991 through 1997 to a Level I pediatric trauma center was conducted. All stable patients were initially managed nonoperatively according to the Isolated Liver Laceration Critical Pathway. Surveillance was performed by physical examination and tracking of hematocrit and liver function test (LFT) results. Follow-up ultrasound (US) or computed tomography (CT) were performed as clinically indicated.In all, 185 patients with nonoperatively managed blunt hepatic injuries were identified during a 7-year period. Over 90% (168/185) were successfully managed nonoperatively without adverse sequelae. Ten patients (5.4%) died: seven as a result of head injury three as a result of multisystem organ failureComplications of NOM of pediatric blunt hepatic injury are rare, but may include biloma, hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm, and necrotic gallbladder. Complications occur only with Grade III or greater injuries and are accompanied by fever, right upper quadrant pain, feeding intolerance, and persistently elevated LFTs. The clinician must maintain a high index of suspicion for the development of complications and have a low threshold for obtaining a CT or US for diagnosis. Interventional radiology techniques, angiography, and ERCP are useful adjuncts to nonoperative management, but some patients may still require laparotomy for management of complications.
