Distinguishing between periampullary carcinoids and carcinomas--is this possible preoperatively? It is difficult to distinguish between carcinoid tumors of the pancreatic head and periampullary region and carcinomas preoperatively. Between 1996 and 2002, 125 consecutive pancreaticoduodenectomies done by us for periampullary tumors (14 carcinoids, 111 carcinomas) were analyzed. Patients with carcinoid tumors had significantly younger mean age (48 vs. 54 years), longer history (32 vs. 8 weeks), lower serum total bilirubin levels (1.4 vs. 6.3 mg/dL) and on CT scan, had larger, well-localized tumors (5 cm vs. 2 cm). Their postoperative course was better with no mortality or major morbidity, whereas after resection for carcinoma 7 (6.3%) patients died and 30 (27%) had major postoperative complications. Thus, a tumor of this region in a young patient with indolent history, low bilirubin level and with CT scan depicting a large expansile lesion suggests a carcinoid. Such tumors may be safely resected with low postoperative morbidity and mortality and good long-term prognosis.
