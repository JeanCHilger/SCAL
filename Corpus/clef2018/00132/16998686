Bizarre presentation of epigastric heteropagus: report of a case. We report an unusual case of epigastric heteropagus in a female neonate. The parasite had a single lung as well as a liver, stomach, intestine, pancreas, ovaries, a single kidney, and a bladder. These visceral organs were located in the abdominal and pelvic space of the autosite, and the pelvic bone and lower legs of the parasite were fused with the respective organs in the autosite. The infant underwent operations to remove the central leg and some of the intra-abdominal organs of the parasite, but she must still undergo further surgery to remove the genitourinary organs and pelvic bones of the parasite, and repair her very abducted and rotated right leg.
