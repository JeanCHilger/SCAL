Does secretin-stimulated MRCP predict exocrine pancreatic insufficiency?: A comparison with noninvasive exocrine pancreatic function tests. Data on magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography with secretin stimulation (S-MRCP) for the assessment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) are limited. We compared pancreatic function tests with the findings of S-MRCP in patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP) and disease controls.S-MRCP was performed in 23 patients (18 CP, 5 disease controls). MRCP images were analyzed for secretin-induced duodenal liquid filling (0=no filling 1=duodenal bulbEPI was diagnosed in 10 of 18 patients with CP. Patients without EPI showed either grade 2 (n=4) or grade 3 (n=9) duodenal filling, whereas only 1/10 patients with EPI showed grade 3 duodenal filling. Sensitivity and specificity of S-MRCP for the diagnosis of EPI were 69% and 90%, respectively.Assessment of duodenal filling should be performed in patients who undergo S-MRCP for the evaluation of pancreatic morphology. However, minor degrees of duodenal filling are equivocal and require further diagnostic evaluation.
