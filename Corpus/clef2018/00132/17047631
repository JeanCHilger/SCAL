Diagnostic algorithm in severe acute pancreatitis. Efficacy of diagnostic algorithm in 164 patients with severe acute pancreatitis based on complex results of ultrasonic examination, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, computed tomography, magnetic resonance pancreatocholangiography and retrograde pancreatocholangiography is analyzed. The results show that this algorithm is highly effective and provides optimal treatment policy, better treatment results and lower lethality in severe acute pancreatitis. Balthazar's score system with calculation of CTSI index in combination with Ranson and Apache II scales raise accuracy of the disease prognosis.
