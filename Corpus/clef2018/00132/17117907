Perforation of the acalculous gallbladder in a renal transplant recipient with CMV infection. We report the case of a renal transplant recipient who developed acute acalculous cholecyscitis resulting in gallbladder perforation. At admission CMV antigenemia was negative. Emergency laparatomy was performed and showed the gallbladder to be infarted with a perforation. The abdominal cavity contained two litres of sterile bilious fluid. The pathological report showed frequent endothelial cells contained intranuclear and intracitoplasmatic inclusion (fig. 1). Treatment with Ganciclovir iv was started after diagnosis, but a computerized tomography scan demonstrated severe acute pancreatitis (grade E. Baltazar). The patient developed multiorgan failure and died on 19th day after surgery. Necropsy showed cytomegalic inclusions in pancreas (fig. 2), gastrointerstinal tract, lung and graft. A necroticing pneumonia with Mycotic spores and hiphae was seen. Aspergillus was also observed in myocardium (fig. 3).
