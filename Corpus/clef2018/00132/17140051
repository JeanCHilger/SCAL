Endocrine tumors of the pancreas: experience in the ABC Medical Center. To analyze presentation, diagnosis and treatment of islet cell tumors at the ABC Medical Center.Medical records of the 7 patients with endocrine tumors diagnosed between 1995 and 2005 were reviewed and analyzed, with emphasis to clinical, biochemical and radiological characteristics, surgical treatment and outcome.There were 3 insulinomas, 1 gastrinoma, 1 VIPoma, and 2 non-functioning tumors. All insulinomas presented the Whipple's triad. The tumor was localized before surgery in 2 cases. In all patients intraoperative ultrasound confirmed the tumor and enucleation was performed in all three. The patient with gastrinoma was diagnosed by endoscopy in the presence of metastatic disease, therefore no surgical treatment was performed. The patient with VIPoma, presented the typical secretory diarrhea. A tumor in the pancreatic head was found and it was resected by pancreaticoduodenectomy. Histology revealed a malignant lesion. Both non functioning tumors were found by imaging studies, one benign tumor was treated by central pancreatectomy and the other was malignant and underwent distal en-block pancreatectomy. Immunohistochemistry was positive for VIP in the benign lesion. Two of the 3 malignant tumors have died and one is alive with recurrent disease.Distribution of islet cell tumors in our series followed the usual patterns. In all functioning lesions hormonal production was identified before surgery. Imaging studies localized the tumor in 7 of the 8 patients. Surgical resection cured all benign tumors.
