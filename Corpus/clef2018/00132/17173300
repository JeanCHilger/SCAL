The role of endoscopic ultrasound and endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration in distinguishing pancreatic cystic lesions. Distinguishing mucinous from nonmucinous cystic lesions of the pancreas often constitutes a diagnostic dilemma. The clinical management differs between such lesions therefore it is important to make an accurate preoperative diagnosis. Various centers have reported conflicting results regarding their ability to detect mucin-producing neoplastic cells and appropriately reach a diagnosis based on endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided FNA. The aim of this study is to assess the ability of EUS-FNA cytology to diagnose and differentiate mucinous from nonmucinous pancreatic cystic lesions. We reviewed records of patients who underwent EUS of pancreatic cystic lesions. If FNA was performed and mucinous neoplasm was suspected, aspirate was evaluated for cytomorphology and presence of mucin. FNA results were compared to final histologic diagnosis if surgery was performed. Cytologic diagnosis was provided for 28/30 (93%). By comparing EUS-FNA diagnoses with final surgical pathology, FNA accurately diagnosed in 10/11 cases with sensitivity and specificity for detection of malignancy of 100 and 89, respectively, while the accuracy for identification of mucinous cystic neoplasms was 100%. Our results indicate that in the appropriate clinical and imaging setting, EUS-FNA cytology with analysis for mucin production by tumor cells is an important test in distinguishing pancreatic cystic lesions and guiding further management.
