Multi-detector row CT attenuation measurements: assessment of intra- and interscanner variability with an anthropomorphic body CT phantom. To determine the dependence of absolute computed tomographic (CT) attenuation values on multi-detector row CT scanner type, convolution kernel, and tube current by using an anthropomorphic phantom.A customized phantom was designed with tissue-equivalent materials to simulate contrast material-enhanced liver, spleen, pancreas, aorta, kidney, 0- and 50-HU cylindric renal cysts, muscle, and fat. The phantom was scanned with five multi-detector row CT scanners (LightSpeed QXi, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wis MX8000, Philips Medical Systems, Best, the NetherlandsTube current had no significant effect (P>.4) on observed tissue attenuation. Significant (P<.0001) differences were observed between imaging regimens with respect to mean attenuation for each tissue type. Convolution kernel modification had an inconsistent effect on tissue attenuation, depending on the scanner. All multi-detector row CT scanners displayed intrascanner variability in tissue attenuation (minimum range: 8.4 HU for fat tissue with the Sensation 16 maximum range: 63.4 HU for liver tissue with the Sensation 64). The scanners behaved differently at the lower range of the CT number scale, where 0-HU cyst attenuation ranged from -15.7 to 23.9 HU and one vendor's equipment showed significantly lower mean attenuation values.CT attenuation values vary significantly between different manufacturers' multi-detector row CT scanners, among different generations of multi-detector row CT scanning equipment, and with individual combinations of scanner and convolution kernel.http://radiology.rsnajnls.org/cgi/content/full/242/1/109/DC1
