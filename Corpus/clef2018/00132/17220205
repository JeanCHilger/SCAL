Endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration of non-pancreatic lesions: an institutional experience. Endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (EUS-FNA) has proven to be an effective diagnostic modality for the detection and staging of pancreatic malignancies. In recent years EUS-FNA has also been used to diagnose lesions of non-pancreatic sites such as structures in close proximity to the gut wall within the mediastinum, abdomen, pelvis and retro-peritoneum.To evaluate experience with EUS-FNA of non-pancreatic sites at a large university medical centre.The study cohort included 234 patients who underwent EUS-FNA of 246 lesions in non-pancreatic sites (122 peri-pancreatic and coeliac lymph nodes 9 peri-pancreatic massesThe cytology diagnoses were classified as non-neoplastic/reactive in 82 (33%), atypical/suspicious for malignancy in 25 (10%), malignant in 86 (35%) and non-diagnostic in 53 (22%) cases. Surgical pathology follow-up was available in 75 (31%) cases. Excluding the non-diagnostic cases there were 7 false negative and 3 false positive cases. The sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of EUS-FNA in the diagnosis of lesions of non-pancreatic sites was 92%, 98% and 97%, respectively.EUS-FNA can be effectively used as a diagnostic modality in the diagnosis of lesions from non-pancreatic sites.
