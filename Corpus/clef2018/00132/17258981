EUS-guided pancreatogastrostomy and pancreatobulbostomy for the treatment of pain in patients with pancreatic ductal dilatation inaccessible for transpapillary endoscopic therapy. EUS-guided pancreatogastrostomy (EPG) is described as an alternative to surgery for ductal decompression in symptomatic patients when endoscopic transpapillary access of the main pancreatic duct (MPD) is impossible.To present the midterm clinical response and follow-up of a larger group of patients treated with EPG and a new transbulbar approach, EUS-guided pancreatobulbostomy (EPB).Retrospective case review.Two tertiary referral centers in Brussels and Marseille.From 2000 to 2004, 36 patients (51 years old range, 14-71 years) were seen.EPG or EPB.Pain relief, technical aspects, complications, and clinical follow-up.Indications were chronic pancreatitis, with complete obstruction (secondary to a tight stenosis, a stone, or MPD rupture) inaccessible papilla or impossible cannulation (n = 20)Technically demanding and requires careful pretherapeutic evaluation.EPG or EPB appears to be an effective and relatively safe treatment for the management of pain secondary to pancreatic ductal hypertension in patients with an MPD not accessible by a transpapillary route.
