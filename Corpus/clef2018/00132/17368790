Usefulness of the long-axis and short-axis reformatted images of multidetector-row CT in evaluating T-factor of the surgically resected pancreaticobiliary malignancies. To evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of curved planar reformations along the duct (long-axis CPR) and series of reformations perpendicular to the duct (short-axis MPR) in evaluating T-factors of pancreaticobiliary malignancy.Twenty-five patients with surgically proven pancreaticobiliary malignancy (12 bile duct cancers and 13 pancreas cancers) were evaluated. A dynamic study was performed with multidetector-row CT with four detectors, and reconstructed with 1mm thickness and intervals. Tracing the center of the duct system on axial images, long-axis CPR images and serial short-axis MPR images were obtained. Two radiologists interpreted the T factor of the diseases three times: session (1), axial images only session (2), axial, coronal and sagittal multiplanar reformation imagesIn evaluations of bile duct cancer, Az values of (3) (0.95, 0.92) were higher than those of (1) (0.89, 0.88) and (2) (0.92, 0.89), with some significant differences. In evaluations of pancreas cancer, Az values of all interpretations were almost equal.Long-axis CPR and short-axis MPR images were suggested to be useful as additional images to the original axial images in evaluating the local extension of bile duct carcinomas.
