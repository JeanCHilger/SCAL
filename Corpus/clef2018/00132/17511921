The use of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography in children. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a noninvasive method to evaluate a wide variety of pancreatobiliary disorders. These disorders include choledochal cyst, cholelithiasis, choledocholithiasis, biliary atresia, Caroli's disease, primary sclerosing cholangitis, disorders of the pancreatobiliary junction, pancreas divisum, and pancreatic duct abnormalities related to chronic pancreatitis. The use of MRCP in children is increasing as experience with MRCP grows, and its technological accuracy rivals that of endoscopic evaluation. We review the current state of MRCP use in children.
