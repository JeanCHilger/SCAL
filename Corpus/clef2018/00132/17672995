Value of CT enhancement degree in differential diagnosis between pancreatic carcinoma and inflammatory pancreatic mass. To compare the CT enhancement degree in pancreatic carcinoma (PC) and inflammatory pancreatic mass (IPM), and to study the diagnostic value of CT to these two diseases.Eighty-five patients with PC or IPM, 47 males and 38 females, aged 62 (37-79), underwent plain CT scanning and enhanced CT scanning in pancreatic phase and delay phase. The CT values of the pancreatic mass and relative normal pancreatic tissue were measured. The diagnosis of PC and IPM was verified by operation, biopsy, etc. Sixty persons without pancreatic diseases were used as controls.Among the 85 patients, 66 were proved to be with PC, and 19 patients were proved to be with IPM. In plain CT scanning, pancreatic-phase CT enhancement, and delay-phase CT enhancement, the CT values of PC were (34+/-7) HU, (54+/-10) HU, and (61+/-14) HU respectively and the CT values of the relatively normal pancreatic tissue were (42+/-6) HU, (105+/-12) HU, and (77+/-10) HU respectively. In plain CT scanning, pancreatic-phase CT enhancement, and delay-phase CT enhancement, the CT values of IPM were (37+/-6) HU, (58+/-17) HU, and (64+/-10) HU respectivelyThere is a certain limit for CT enhancement in differentiating between PC and IPM. Comprehensive analysis is necessary in diagnosis of PC and IPM.
