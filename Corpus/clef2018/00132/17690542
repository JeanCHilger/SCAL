MR imaging features of solid-pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas. Solid-pseudopapillary tumor (SPT) of the pancreas is characterized as cystic, necrotic, and hemorrhagic degeneration. In this study, magnetic resonance (MR) findings of 4 cases were reviewed. Patchy or spotty areas of high intensity that suggested hemorrhagic degeneration were constantly detected on fat-suppressed T(1)-weighted images. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging revealed mild and gradual increase of contrast enhancement in solid portions. Multi-contrast MR imaging that included fat-suppressed T(1)-weighted imaging and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging allowed accurate diagnosis of SPT and its differentiation from other tumors.
