Liposarcoma of the stomach: a rare case report. Liposarcoma is the most common soft tissue sarcoma and accounts for 15%-20% of all mesenchymal malignancies. The tumor occurs most frequently in the limbs, retroperitoneum and rarely has a visceral location. We report a case of a gastric liposarcoma in a male patient. A 68 years old male patient was admitted to hospital for abdominal discomfort and fullness lasting for a month. He reported rare episodes of vomiting. The CT examination revealed a large epigastric mass (8 cm x 4 cm) involving the lesser curvature of the stomach, in contact with the pancreas and gallbladder. Fatty areas within the mass were evident. A total gastrectomy together with cholecystectomy was performed. The histopathological diagnosis was a well differentiated liposarcoma. The patient did not undergo any adjuvant treatment, he is under close follow up and two years later he is disease free. We report this case due to the rarity of this tumor in the stomach (nine cases reported in the literature).
