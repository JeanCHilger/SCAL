Ectopic hepatocellular carcinoma arising from pancreas: a case report and review of the literature. A 56-year-old man was found to have a pancreatic tail tumor. His blood chemistry showed no infection with hepatitis B or C virus and no elevations of tumor markers or pancreatic hormones. Abdominal ultrasound showed an encapsulated, rather heterogeneous, hypoechoic tumor, 6.5 cm in maximum diameter, with a beak sign. Helical dynamic CT revealed an irregularly enhanced tumor with pooling of contrast medium in the delayed phase. Abdominal angiography showed a hypervascular tumor. With a tentative diagnosis of non-functional islet-cell tumor, the patient underwent resection of the pancreatic body and tail with splenectomy. The contour of the liver and its surface were normal. In microscopic examination, tumor cells arranged in a trabecular pattern with focal bile pigment resembling hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Immunohistochemically, these tumor cells were positivefor HEPPAR-1, CAM5.2, cytokeratin 18 and COX-2, but negative for MUC-1, and cytokeratins 7, 20 and 8. These results supported a diagnosis of HCC without any adenocarcinoma component. The patient is currently doing well without any signs of recurrence in either the remaining pancreas or liver three years after surgery. We report the rare case with ectopic HCC in the pancreas with a review of the literature.
