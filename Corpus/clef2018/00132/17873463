Heterotopic pancreas as a leading point for small-bowel intussusception in a pregnant woman. Adult intussusception occurs infrequently and differs from childhood intussusception in its presentation, etiology and treatment. Diagnosis can be delayed because of its longstanding, intermittent, and non-specific symptoms, and most cases are diagnosed at emergency laparotomy.We present the diagnosis and management of our patient, a pregnant woman, who had adult intussusception due to a heterotopic pancreas.Although relatively rare, intussusception should be included in the differential diagnosis of small bowel obstruction.
