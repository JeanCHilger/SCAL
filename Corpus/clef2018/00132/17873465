Groove pancreatitis: a case report and review of literature. Groove pancreatitis is a rare type of segmental pancreatitis characterized by fibrous scars of the anatomic space between the dorsocranial part of the head of the pancreas, the duodenum, and the common bile duct.A 40-year-old man, with a past history of chronic alcohol consumption presented with epigastric pain radiating to the back and intermittent vomiting and a weight loss of 9 kg. A CT of the abdomen revealed swelling of the pancreatic head, a hypodense mass and duodenal wall thickening with luminal narrowing. Peripancreatic fluid and dense strands were also seen. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed an edematous, shiny, reddish raised mucosa having a polypoid appearance with narrowing of the second portion of the duodenum. Histological examination of the duodenal biopsy specimens showed preservation of the crypt-villus ratio, and the submucosa showed Brunner gland hyperplasia. These findings appeared consistent with the diagnosis of groove pancreatitis. Presently, the patient is on conservative medical management with analgesics, proton pump inhibitors and a pancreatic enzyme supplement.Groove pancreatitis often masquerades as pancreatic head carcinoma. This condition should be kept in mind when making the differential diagnosis between pancreatic masses and duodenal stenosis. In all cases of focal pancreatitis involving the head or uncinate process of the pancreas with involvement of the adjacent duodenum, the possibility of groove pancreatitis should be considered.
