Diagnosis and management of pancreatic fistulae resulting in pancreatic ascites or pleural effusions in the era of helical CT and magnetic resonance imaging. Diagnosis of internal pancreatic fistulae (IPF) resulting in ascites or pleural effusions may be facilitated by multislice helical CT-scan and MR-pancreatography [MRP]). Conservative treatment with parenteral nutrition and somatostatin analogues (+/- pancreatic stenting) yields varying results. We aimed to evaluate the usefulness of helical CT and MRP in the diagnosis of IPF. The outcome of patients when the following stepwise treatment algorithm is applied is also descried: i) conservative (enteral nutrition and somatostatin analogues) ii) endoscopic stentingSixteen consecutive patients (13 M median age 42 (14-54) yrs) with chronic pancreatitis (alcoholic 15, hereditary 1) and an IPF were prospectively included between March-01 to December-03. All serous effusions (ascites, N=10The diagnosis of IPF and its site were determined in 12/16 patients by CT and 14/15 patients by MRP (site of rupture: head: N=5 isthmus: N=5Helical CT scan and MRP are useful in localizing MPD rupture sites and fistulae and may obviate the need for pancreatic opacification. A systematic treatment algorithm can be safely used starting with medical strategies (enteral nutrition safely replacing the parenteral route) progressing to endoscopy and finally surgery. Overall about 44% of patients require surgery initially or at follow-up.
