Pancreatic adenocarcinoma: value of multidetector CT angiography in preoperative evaluation. To retrospectively assess the sensitivity and specificity of multidetector computed tomographic (CT) angiography in the preoperative evaluation of pancreatic adenocarcinoma by using surgical findings as the reference standard.The institutional review board approved this HIPAA-compliant study informed consent was waived. We reviewed CT reports, surgical notes, and pathology reports from 114 patients with pancreatic or distal cholangiocarcinoma who underwent multidetector CT angiography and surgery at our institution between March 2003 and March 2006. When CT findings and surgical reports were discordant, radiologists experienced in pancreatic imaging retrospectively reviewed images for lesion resectabilityEighty-eight patients had resectable lesions according to CT angiographic criteria (group A: 46 women, 42 men mean age, 67 yearsMultidetector CT angiography is an effective preoperative tool that reduces the number of aborted pancreatic resections there is no evidence from this retrospective study suggesting varying results from the various generations of multidetector CT scanners used.
