Mesenchymal tumor of the pancreas: report of a case. Mesenchymal tumors of the pancreas are rare and difficult to classify. We report a case of a solitary mesenchymal tumor in the body of the pancreas. The tumor showed immunocytochemical reactivity for anti-vimentin, anti-alpha-smooth muscle actin, and anti-CD34 however, it was negative immunohistochemically for antibodies to cytokeratins, as well as for the following antibodies: anti-desmin, anti-S-100, anti-chromogranin A, anti-CD117 (c-Kit), anti-CD99, and anti-bcl-2. This tumor could not be classified as a specific type of mesenchymal tumor immunocytochemically.
