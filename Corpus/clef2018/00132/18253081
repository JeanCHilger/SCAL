Pancreatic metastasis in a child suffering with treated stage 4 neuroblastoma. We present here a very rare case of metastatic relapse in the pancreas of a 4-year-old boy who had been treated for stage 4 neuroblastoma. Computed tomography showed multiple metastatic masses in the pancreas with secondary pancreatitis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of pancreatic metastasis in a child with neuroblastoma.
