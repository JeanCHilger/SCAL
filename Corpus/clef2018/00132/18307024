Complete response of a pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma to chemoradiotherapy. A 51-year-old woman with an unresectable pancreatic tumor that was histologically diagnosed as an adenosquamous carcinoma underwent chemoradiotherapy with 5-fluourouracil (FU) and low-dose cisplatin (low-dose FP). Because we recognized a partial response to the chemoradiotherapy, we subsequently administered combined chemotherapy with S-1 and cisplatin. After one course of this combined chemotherapy, the tumor was further reduced in size and became difficult to discern on abdominal computed tomography (CT). We have continued to administer the S-1 and cisplatin combined chemotherapy, and the patient is still alive. After 20 months of treatment, the tumor has not recurred (as assessed by abdominal CT). Additionally, we have not seen elevation of tumor markers. This report presents the successful use of chemoradiotherapy with low-dose FP and additional combined chemotherapy with S-1 and cisplatin for unresectable pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma.
