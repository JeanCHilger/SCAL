A 67-year-old patient with recurrent hypoglycemia. A 67 year old female patient was admitted to our clinic with recurrent hypoglycemia in December 2006. Laboratory findings revealed an elevated insulin, and C-peptide. Imaging techniques revealed a tumor of the pancreas involving the spleen with metastases of the liver, expressing somatostatin receptors. Ultrasound-guided biopsy was performed and confirmed the suspected insulinoma. Since the hypoglycemias could not sufficiently be controlled by subcutaneous administration of octreotide and by oral glucose intake, surgical debulking was performed in a palliative intention. After resection the patient was free of hypoglycemia. In case of diagnosed insulinoma, underlying MEN (multiple endocrine neoplasia) should be considered. Excision of the tumor is recommended in patients with benign solitary insulinomas. If complete excision is impossible, there are several therapeutic options that aim at preventing hypoglycemia. Thus, in contrast to other extended tumors, surgery is reasonable in malignant insulinoma even in case of metastatic disease.
