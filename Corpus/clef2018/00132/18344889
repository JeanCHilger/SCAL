Endoscopic diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cysts. Pancreatic cystic neoplasms have emerged as an important new opportunity for many disciplines to participate in the diagnosis and management of early pancreatic neoplasia. With an increase in an understanding of these lesions and their potential for malignant transformation, there has been a dramatic increase in the frequency of diagnosis. We critically examined the literature on diagnostic methods for pancreatic cystic lesions over the past 5 years. The methods of endoscopic pancreatic pseudocyst drainage and clinical outcomes are also discussed. Morphologic studies of cystic lesions using cross-sectional imaging or endoscopic ultrasound have a low diagnostic rate. Cyst fluid analysis with the use of tumor markers (eg, carcinoembryonic antigen) increases the accuracy of diagnosis. The management of cystic lesions is heavily dependent on the type of cyst, the neoplastic potential, and the risk of surgery. The traditional therapy is pancreatic resection and not cyst enucleation. In contrast to cystic neoplasms, pseudocysts are localized collections of inflammatory fluid that mimic cystic neoplasms. The fluid collections arise from chronic pancreatitis and ductal leaks. Because pseudocysts have no neoplastic potential, they can be drained rather than resected. Drainage can be safely accomplished with external catheters or endoscopically with internal catheters. As we learn more about the pathophysiology of the various cystic lesions, treatment will be tailored to the specific cyst lesion. Endoscopic ultrasound has an important role in the characterization of pancreatic cystic lesions and helps in selection of the optimal treatment modality.
