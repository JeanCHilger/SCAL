Hydatid cyst of the pancreas. Apropos of 2 cases. Two new cases of pancreatic hydatidosis are reported. The diagnosis of a cystic lesion of the pancreas has been easily established owing to the modern imaging techniques, especially to computed tomography. The hydatid nature has also been recognized before surgery on the basis of the epidemiological data, the existence of a calcified shell in one case, and positive serology in the other. Retrograde endoscopic cholangiowirsungography allowed specifying the relationships between the cyst and the pancreatic duct in one case. The treatment consisted in the resection of the protruding dome and in total cystectomy. There were no postoperative complications. The preoperative diagnosis of the lesion must no longer be regarded as difficult. The treatment does not raise any specific difficulties when there is no fistula into the pancreatic duct. Retrograde endoscopic cholangiowirsungography is a good means of recognizing a possible fistula and makes a scheduled surgical treatment possible.
