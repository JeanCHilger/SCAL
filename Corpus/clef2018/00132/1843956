Gastric epithelioid leiomyosarcoma (malignant leiomyoblastoma). Report of a case and review of the world literature. The authors report a case of gastric epithelial leiomyoma. (Leiomyoblastoma). Macroscopically, such tumors resemble leiomyoma, with a biological behavior between leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma. A review of the medical literature indicates that gastrointestinal bleeding in the most usual manifestation. The endoscopy biopsy, many times, is unable to confirm the malignant or benign of the tumor. It is emphasized the importance of identifying the potentially malignant tendency of the tumor, indicated, mainly, by histology consist in total gastric resection. Radiology, Ultrasound and Endoscopy are the most frequently used methods to arrive at diagnosis. In our case a patient with a presumed diagnosis of gastric cancer with a severe upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage was operated on as an emergency. A radical extended total gastrectomy was performed. Intraoperative findings included multiple pancreatic, hepatic, splenic, hilium, greater and lesser omental metastases. The patient was released in good condition but died 3 months later.
