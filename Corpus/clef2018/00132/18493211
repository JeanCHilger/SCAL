Endoscopic ultrasonography in pediatric patients with gastrointestinal disorders. Endoscopic ultrasound is a diagnostic tool for evaluation of gastrointestinal diseases in adults, but in children the use of endoscopic ultrasound is limited. This study retrospectively evaluates endoscopic ultrasound indications in, safety in, and impact on children.We reviewed the data of all of the pediatric patients (<18 years old) that underwent endoscopic ultrasound in our institution. The main goal was to evaluate the impact of endoscopic ultrasound in this patient population. Significant impact was defined as a new diagnosis or treatment attributed to the endoscopic ultrasound examination.Thirty-two children (21 boys, 11 girls) at mean age 12 +/- 5 years (range = 1.5-18 years) underwent endoscopic ultrasound during a period of 6 years. The pancreas and biliary tract were examined in 19 children, esophagus in 8, and the stomach and rectum in 2 children each. Only 1 child had endoscopic ultrasound for duodenal indication. The indications in the pancreas and biliary tract group were recurrent pancreatitis in 9 children, cyst or mass in 6 children, and obstructive jaundice in 4 children. Indications in the esophagus group were stenosis in 4 children, and suspected duplication and esophageal mass in 2 children each. We used conscious sedation in 18 children and unconscious sedation in 12. Two children underwent endoscopic ultrasound with no anesthesia at all. In 7 cases, endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration was performed. The procedure was successful in all of the patients with no complications. Endoscopic ultrasound changed the diagnosis or therapy in 14 cases.Endoscopic ultrasound is an effective tool in the evaluation of pediatric gastrointestinal patients, mostly with pancreatobiliary or esophageal disorders. Endoscopic ultrasound is a safe procedure with a significant impact in almost half of the children examined.
