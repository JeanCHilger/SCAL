Endoscopic resolution of pseudocyst infection and necrosis as a complication of endoscopic pseudocyst drainage. A case report. Endoscopic therapy has recently gained importance as an option for the treatment of pancreatic necrosis. We report a case of transgastric endoscopic resolution of pseudocyst infection and necrosis as a complication of endoscopic pseudocyst drainage.The patient underwent several sessions of endoscopic removal of debris and necrotic material, intercalated with daily lavage and aspiration through a nasocystic tube.At the present time, fourteen months after pancreatic pseudocyst secondary infection, the patient remains asymptomatic with no radiographic signs of pseudocyst recurrence. Transmural endoscopic therapy followed by continuous drainage and necrosectomy is a reasonable option for treating the pancreatic pseudocyst secondary infection.
