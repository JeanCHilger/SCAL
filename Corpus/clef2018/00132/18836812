Multicentric pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs) presenting with the clinical features of chronic pancreatitis. A 46-year-old woman was readmitted to our hospital in August 2005 because of severe abdominal pain and nausea. Computed tomography demonstrated a huge cystic lesion in the retroperitoneal space behind the hepatoduodenal ligament and lesser peritoneal cavity. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography revealed communication between the dilated main pancreatic duct and a pseudocyst. The condition was preoperatively diagnosed as chronic pancreatitis associated with a pseudocyst or an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm without mucin hypersecretion. The patient underwent a distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy. The pathologic diagnosis was multicentric pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), and histological examination revealed a positive surgical margin around the remnant pancreas. Four months after the surgery, the patient underwent a total pancreatectomy. Macroscopic observation revealed diffuse fibrosis of the pancreatic parenchyma compatible with chronic pancreatitis. Histological examination revealed a constellation of noninvasive intraductal neoplasias with high-grade atypia, diffusely distributed in the small pancreatic ducts of the resected pancreas. Localized fibrosis and cystic dilation of the small ducts were detected in a lobule of exocrine glands draining into a ductule involved by PanIN lesions in the head of the pancreas. In summary, multicentric PanIN lesions are associated with lobular atrophy of the pancreatic parenchyma and chronic pancreatitis-like changes that follow. Total pancreatectomy may be recommended for patients with multicentric precursor lesions throughout the entire pancreas.
