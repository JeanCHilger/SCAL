Accessory splenic infarction presenting as a hemorrhagic tumor in the pancreas. We present a case of intrapancreatic accessory splenic infarction in a 28-year-old woman. It was discovered during a workup for an acute right epigastric pain. Computed tomography imaging of abdomen demonstrated a hemorrhagic high attenuation with enhancing solid portion in the tail of pancreas. The clinical and radiological differential diagnosis included pancreatic mucinous cystic neoplasm, pancreatic endocrine neoplasm, solid pseudopapillary tumor, ductal adenocarcinoma, and metastasis. A distal pancreatectomy was completed. The microscopic examination revealed heterotopic splenic tissue with infarction and her abdominal pain disappeared. In this case report, we first describe a symptomatic accessory splenic infarction which presented as a hemorrhagic mass in the tail of pancreas mimicking pancreatic neoplasm.
