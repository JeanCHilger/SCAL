Diagnostic and therapeutic applications of endoscopic ultrasound-guided punctures. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has emerged as an excellent tool for the imaging of the gastrointestinal wall and surrounding structures. EUS-guided fine needle aspiration has broadened the applicability of this tool by allowing tissue sampling of a variety of lesions within or accessible from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. In particular, EUS became the test of choice for evaluating pancreatic cysts and mass lesions, biliary strictures and masses, abnormal adenopathy accessible from the GI tract, and GI submucosal lesions. There appears to be an increasing role for EUS in the staging of lung cancer, evaluating adrenal lesions and GI mesenchymal tumors. More recently, EUS has acquired a new dimension in interventional applications. This includes, but is not limited to, celiac plexus block and celiac neurolysis for the management of pain associated with chronic pancreatitis and locally advanced pancreaticobiliary malignancies, respectively.
