A case of metastatic pancreatic cancer after combination chemotherapy with uracil-tegafur and gemcitabine. We report a case of pancreas head cancer with liver metastasis treated with uracil-tegafur (UFT) and gemcitabine combined chemotherapy. A 66-year-old man was referred to our hospital for obstructive jaundice. We planned to perform a pancreatoduodenectomy, but a small nodule was found at laparotomy on the liver surface. The histopathological diagnosis was adenocarcinoma, so we inserted a self-expandable metallic stent (EMS) in this inoperable pancreas head cancer. We performed 9 courses of UFT and gemcitabine (GEM) combination chemotherapy. Renewed liver metastases did not appear, and the pancreas head tumor partially responded. Pancreatoduodenectomy was performed, and EMS could not be separated from the common bile duct. After treatment with an additional 11 courses of chemotherapy, he took S-1 orally because of a tumor recurrence. He survived for 24 months from the first laparotomy. Combination chemotherapy and surgery enhanced the survival benefit in this case.
