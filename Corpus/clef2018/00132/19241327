Optimization of scan delay for routine abdominal 64-slice CT with body weight-adapted application of contrast material. Determination of an adequate scan delay for routine abdominal 64-slice CT examinations with body weight-adapted contrast application.57 patients underwent abdominal CT with a 64-slice scanner. The contrast material was adapted to patient body weight. All patients were randomized into five groups with varying scan delay and scan direction (group 1: delay 65 sec group 2: 75 secThe diagnostic acceptability of protocols 3 and 4 were rated equally good and significantly/substantially superior to protocol 1 (p = 0.004/0.008) and protocol 5, respectively. Contrast enhancement in the aorta and portal vein peaked at 65 sec. Contrast enhancement in the hepatic and iliac veins peaked at 85 sec independently of the scan direction but was substantially lower at 75 sec. Liver parenchyma enhancement was lowest at 95 sec.This data suggests an optimal scan delay for routine abdominal 64-slice CT of 85 sec regardless of scan direction.
