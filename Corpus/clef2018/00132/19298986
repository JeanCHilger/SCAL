Desmoplastic small round cell tumor of the abdomen: CT findings and radiologic-pathologic correlation in 3 cases. We describe the CT findings of abdominal desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) in three patients. The most common imaging finding was the presence of single or multiple soft-tissue density intraperitoneal masses without apparent origin in an abdominal organ. In the first patient, a single peritoneal mass was located in the mesentery between the stomach and pancreas. In the second patient, an intraperitoneal pelvic mass was seen in the retrovesical space. In the third patient, a large homogeneous soft-tissue mass that nearly filled the entire peritoneal space was found. Two patients had multiple liver metastases and adenopathies at the time of diagnosis. The diagnosis was confirmed with CT-guided percutaneous biopsies in all three cases. DSRCT should be suspected in young men with multiple bulky heterogeneous soft-tissue masses.
