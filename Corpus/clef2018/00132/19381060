A patient diagnosed as autoimmune pancreatitis 6 years after onset of jaundice. The clinical manifestations of autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) are diffuse pancreatic swelling, diffuse irregular narrowing of the main pancreatic duct, and increased serum IgG or positive serum autoantibody. Clinically, AIP can be improved dramatically with oral steroid therapy. In this report, we describe a 62-year-old woman diagnosed as autoimmune pancreatitis six years after onset of jaundice, who presented with uncontrolled blood glucose levels. The laboratory tests revealed obstructive jaundice, and the computed tomography of the pancreas showed pancreatic swelling. After six years of onset, she was diagnosed with AIP and successfully treated with steroid treatment.
