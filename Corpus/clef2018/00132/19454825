Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration using helical computerized tomography for TN staging and vascular injury in operable pancreatic carcinoma. EUS-FNA is increasingly being used in operable pancreatic carcinoma cases identified by CT.Determine the safety, accuracy and clinical utility of EUS-FNA for T, N and TN staging and vascular injury assessment in proven ductal pancreatic carcinoma.Fifty-two consecutive patients (29 women and 23 men) with histologically ductal pancreatic carcinoma, with an excellent possibility of mass resection assessed by helical computerized tomography, were studied. Mean age was 62.4 years (range: 27-82 years). Tumor locations were in the head (43 cases), body (5 cases) and tail (4 cases) of the pancreas. Mean tumor size from EUS was 3.7 cm (range: 0.8-6.2 cm).We reviewed medical records and abdominal ultrasound, CT, EUS-FNA and the results were compared to surgical and histological findings.Ultrasound identified pancreatic abnormalities in 38 out of 52 patients (73.1%): pancreatic mass (25 cases), pancreatic head enlargement (8 cases), dilation of main pancreatic duct (3 cases), pancreatic cyst (1 case) and pancreatic calcification (1 case). CT showed a pancreatic mass (30 cases), pancreatic enlargement (17 cases), pancreatic cystic lesion (2 cases) and pancreatic calcification (1 case) in 50 out of 52 patients (96.2%). EUS-FNA found a clear pancreatic tumor image in all patients (100%). The accuracy of EUS for evaluating portal blood vessels, superior mesenteric artery, T alone, N alone and combined TN staging was 86.5%, 94.2%, 84.7%, 67.3% and 55.8%, respectively. In addition to cytological material from 50 patients, microfragments from 43 patients were sent for histological analysis. Two patients (3.8%) showed minor complications: self-limited bleeding and acute pancreatitis.EUS-FNA is safe, and can help gastroenterologists and surgeons make surgical decisions regarding pancreatic carcinoma patients.
