Contrast-enhanced ultrasound of the pancreas--a method beyond its potential or a new diagnostic standard? Contrast-enhanced ultrasound is a relatively new technique, currently used for liver tumors diagnosis. Newer contrast agents are composed of stabilized micro-bubbles capable of traversing the capillary circulation. Lately, the method has also been used in the assessment of pancreatic disorders. Pulse inversion harmonic imaging allows the assessment of the hypervascularised masses as neuroendocrine tumors, of the hypoperfused masses as adenocarcinomas and of the necrotic areas in acute pancreatitis. Also, this imaging method allows a better assessment of the pancreatic tumor resectability and the identification of septa inside the cystic lesion. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound might represent a valuable additional imaging method to contrast CT for selected cases.
