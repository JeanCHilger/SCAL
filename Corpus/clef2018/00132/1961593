Lymph node localization of gastrinoma. Diagnosis and treatment. The case of a 48-year old woman with a lymph node localization of gastrinoma is reported. The preoperative workup (US-scan, TC-scan and NMR) made it possible to detect and localize the lesion. A conservative surgical approach was decided according to the latest literature reports which showed a favourable course in patients with lymph node gastrinoma. Surgical resection has been accomplished. The patient's hormone level was normal at one-year follow-up.
