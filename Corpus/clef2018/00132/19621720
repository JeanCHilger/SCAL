Outcome in a large unselected series of patients with acute pancreatitis. The objective of this study was to assess the outcome in a large unselected population of patients with acute pancreatitis treated at a single university center.We performed a retrospective analysis of 364 patients with acute pancreatitis and evaluated outcome, morbidity and mortality in relation to different treatment modalities.238 patients suffered from interstitial-edematous pancreatitis, 126 patients from the necrotizing form. ICU treatment was necessary for 174 patients (48%). Minimally-invasive CT guided drainage techniques were used in 73 patients (20%) with pancreatic necroses but also in seven patients with edematous pancreatitis (2%), which showed extrapancreatic tissue necrosis. The overall hospital mortality was 14% (5.5% for patients with edematous pancreatitis vs. 30% for patients with necrotizing pancreatitis).In patients with the edematous form a small subpopulation showed peripancreatic tissue necrosis without necrosis of the pancreas itself, which was related to higher mortality rates than expected for patients with edematous pancreatitis. Regarding therapeutic procedures interventional treatment modalities should be considered as alternative treatment modalities.
