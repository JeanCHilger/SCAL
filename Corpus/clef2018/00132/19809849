"Paraduodenal" pancreatitis: results of surgery on 58 consecutives patients from a single institution. Cystic dystrophy of heterotopic pancreas, groove pancreatitis, pancreatic hamartoma of the duodenum, paraduodenal wall cyst, and myoadenomatosis are all terms grouped together, from a pathological viewpoint, as definitions of paraduodenal pancreatitis (PP). The objective of the present study was to investigate the clinical characteristics, therapeutic strategies, and results in 58 patients undergoing pancreatic resection for PP.From January 1990 to December 2006 data were prospectively collected on 58 patients who were diagnosed with PP who then underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy.In this patient cohort the median age was 44.7 years only 4 patients were women, and only 3 had non-drinker and/or non smoker habits. The overall morbidity was 18.9%, and the median hospitalization was 11 days. There were no postoperative deaths. In a median follow-up of 96.3 months, all patients noted a decrease in the pain associated with PPPatients with PP have clinical characteristics similar to those of chronic pancreatitis. The diagnostic imaging modalities of choice are ultrasonographic endoscopy and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreaticography. Based on our surgical experience, pancreaticoduodenectomy seems to be a reasonable choice of treatment in patients with PP.
