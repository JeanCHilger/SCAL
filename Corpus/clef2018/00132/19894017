Surgical design and outcome of duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection for benign or low-grade malignant tumors. To apply duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection (DPPHR) as radical procedure for benign or low-grade malignant tumors, it needs the reconciliation of complete pancreatic head resection and preservation of the bile duct and peripancreatic vessels. Several modifications have been introduced and applied to remove these lesions, however, the techniques have not been made clear in the management of the peripancreatic vessels and the bile duct. The long-term outcomes of the DPPHR have been reported as extremely rare in comparison with pylorus preserving pancreatoduodenectomy (PPPD) in these pancreatic head tumors. The angiograms by multi-detector row CT (MD-CT) can be reconstructed more physiologically than selective angiography. The anterior arcade is predominant in 43% of 64 patients. Therefore, we modified the DPPHR to include a complete resection of the pancreatic head and the preservation of both anterior and posterior arterial arcades. The bile duct is covered by the pancreatic parenchyma in various ways. The techniques of the preservation of the bile duct are also introduced. We performed 21 DPPHRs and 19 PPPDs in the patients with benign or low-grade malignant pancreatic head tumor. There was no significant difference in operative factors. The postoperative death was one patient in PPPD, but none in DPPHR. The postoperative complications of PPPD were more often than that of DPPHR. There is no postoperative recurrence in DPPHR in the follow-up period from 2 to 216 months. Both exocrine and endocrine function and the long-term results following DPPHR were superior to those following PPPD. The DPPHR should be favored over the PPPD in benign or low-grade malignant tumors of the head of the pancreas if there is no compromise with oncologic radicality.
