MR cholangiopancreatography at 3.0 T. The rapid evolution of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging technology has produced much-needed improvements in temporal and spatial resolution that have led to greater recognition of diseases of the hepatobiliary and pancreatic ducts at MR cholangiopancreatography. This modality often substitutes for diagnostic evaluations with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography. Recent innovations in whole-body MR imaging, including fast imaging sequences, phased-array coils, parallel imaging techniques, and 3.0-T magnets, allow the acquisition of higher-quality diagnostic images in less time. An understanding of these technical advances and their potential clinical applications, limitations, and pitfalls for cholangiopancreatographic evaluation is as essential as a familiarity with the spectrum of possible findings both are needed to accurately identify and characterize the disease process and to provide effective guidance for treatment.
