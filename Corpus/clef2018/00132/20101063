Acute pancreatitis associated with lisinopril and olanzapine. A case of acute pancreatitis associated with lisinopril and olanzapine is described.A 69-year-old woman came to the emergency department after four days of experiencing epigastric pressurelike pain that radiated to the left lower quadrant and worsened with ingestion of food. She had started lisinopril three months prior for treatment of hypertension and had been taking olanzapine regularly for bipolar disorder. Upon admission, she was afebrile and hemodynamically stable and exhibited tenderness of the epigastric region. Elevated pancreatic enzymes and abdominal computed tomography (CT) imaging findings confirmed the diagnosis of pancreatitis. Common causes of pancreatitis were ruled out, and it was determined that the recent combination of lisinopril and olanzapine was the likely cause. Food and liquids were withheld, and all oral medications were stopped at hospital admission. Her pain resolved completely after two days. She was discharged on hospital day 4, and all of her medications except lisinopril and olanzapine were resumed. During a follow-up visit with her primary care physician, she reported to be doing well and had no systemic complaints. Olanzapine was reinitiated at that time but was discontinued a month later by her psychiatrist, who was concerned about the development of recurrent symptoms of pancreatitis. Valsartan was prescribed to achieve optimal blood pressure control three weeks after discharge. A follow-up CT scan of the abdomen a month later found no residual pancreatic abnormalities.The additive effect of two known pancreatitis-causing medications resulted in increased risk and subsequent acute pancreatitis in this patient.
