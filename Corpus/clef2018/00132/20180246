Gastric duplication associated with pancreas divisum diagnosed by a multidisciplinary approach before surgery. We report a unique case of communicating gastric duplication associated with pancreas divisum, diagnosed with a multidisciplinary approach, including X-rays, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, ultrasound endoscopy and histology. We believe that this approach constitutes a fuller diagnostic evaluation, resulting in better and safer surgery.
