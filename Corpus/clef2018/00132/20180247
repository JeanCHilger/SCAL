Pancreatic pseudocyst filled with semisolid lipids mimicking solid mass on endoscopic ultrasound. Pancreatic pseudocysts, which account for 70%-90% of pancreatic cystic lesions, characteristically are non-epithelially lined cystic cavities that are contiguous with the pancreas. Pancreatic pseudocysts can be caused by acute, chronic or traumatic pancreatitis and should be differentiated from other pancreatic diseases with cystic appearances, especially cystic neoplasms. We report a unique case of a pancreatic pseudocyst filled with semisolid lipids, which appeared by endoscopic ultrasound as a solid mass, and was therefore resected.
