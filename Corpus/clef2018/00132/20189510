Multicenter comparison of the interobserver agreement of standard EUS scoring and Rosemont classification scoring for diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis. EUS has less than optimal interobserver agreement for the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis. The newly developed Rosemont consensus scoring system includes weighted criteria and stricter definitions for individual features.The primary aim was to compare the interobserver agreement of standard and Rosemont scoring.Multiple tertiary-care institutions.Fifty EUS videos were interpreted by 14 experts. Each expert interpreted the videos on two occasions: First, the videos were read by using standard scoring (9 criteria). Second, after viewing a presentation of the Rosemont classification, the same experts re-read the videos by using Rosemont scoring.Fleiss' kappa (K) statistics are reported with 95% confidence intervals (CI).The interobserver agreement was "substantial" (K = 0.65 [95% CI, 0.52-0.77]) for Rosemont scoring and "moderate" (K = 0.54 [95% CI, 0.44-0.66]) for standard scoring however, the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.12).The sample size does not allow detection of differences in K of <0.25.Use of the Rosemont classification did not significantly increase interobserver agreement for EUS diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis compared with standard scoring.
