Solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas: a review of 553 cases in Chinese literature. To sum up the clinical and pathological characteristics of solid pseudopapillary tumor (SPT) and the experience with it.A total of 553 SPT patients reported in Chinese literature between January 1996 and January 2009 were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed.The mean age of the 553 SPT patients included in this review was 27.2 years, and the male to female ratio was 1:8.37. Their symptoms were non-specific, and nearly one third of the patients were asymptomatic. Computed tomography and ultrasonography were performed to show the nature and location of SPT. Most of the tumors were distributed in the pancreatic head (39.8%), tail (24.1%), body and tail (19.5%). Forty-five patients (9.2%) were diagnosed as malignant SPT with metastasis or invasion. None of the clinical factors was closely related to the malignant potential of SPT. Surgery was the main therapeutic modality for SPT. Local resection, distal pancreatectomy and pancreatoduodenectomy were the most common surgical procedures. Local recurrence and hepatic metastasis were found in 11 and 2 patients, respectively, after radical resection. Four patients died of tumor progression within 4 years after palliative resection of SPT. The prognosis of SPT patients was good with a 5-year survival rate of 96.9%.SPT of the pancreas is a rare indolent neoplasm that typically occurs in young females. It is a low-grade malignancy and can be cured with extended resection. The prognosis of such patients is good although the tumor may recur and metastasize.
