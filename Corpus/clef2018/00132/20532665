Radical esophagectomy for a patient with reversed intestinal rotation and complicated vascular anomalies in the abdomen. We report a patient of lower esophageal carcinoma with reversed intestinal rotation and major vascular anomalies including pre-duodenal pre-pancreatic portal vein, absence of the confluence of the splenic vein with the superior mesenteric vein, and deficiency of the common hepatic artery. We performed subtotal esophagectomy with three-field lymphadenectomy following reconstruction with the stomach. The postoperative course was uneventful. This might be the first case that had such complicated anatomical anomalies and radical esophagectomy was performed. As we had preoperatively recognized these anatomical anomalies on radiographic examinations, we could successfully perform esophagectomy and reconstruction without any complications.
