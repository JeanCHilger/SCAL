Characterization of pancreatic metastases from primary lung cancer using magnetic resonance imaging. To evaluate magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of pancreatic metastases secondary to primary lung cancers.Eleven cases included T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and spectral presaturation attenuated inversion recovery T2-weighted images.Of the 21 total pancreatic lesions evaluated, 10 exhibited a peripheral rim of high signal intensity, 9 displayed a homogeneous signal intensity, and 2 lesions demonstrated a heterogeneous pattern of contrast enhancement.Limitations in evaluating pancreatic metastases by MR imaging require definitive diagnoses to rely on both clinical data and MR imaging.
