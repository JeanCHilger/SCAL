Diagnosis and management of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor in von Hippel-Lindau disease. The pancreatic manifestations seen in patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease are subdivided into 2 categories: pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NET), and cystic lesions, including simple cyst and serous cystadenoma. The VHL-associated cystic lesions are generally asymptomatic and do not require any treatment, unless they are indistinguishable from other cystic tumor types with malignant potential. Because pancreatic NET in VHL disease are non-functioning and have malignant potential, it is of clinical importance to find and diagnose these as early as possible. It will be recommended that comprehensive surveillance using dynamic computed tomography for abdominal manifestations, including pancreatic NET, should start from the age of 15 years in VHL patients. Unlike sporadic non-functioning NET without VHL disease, in which surgical resection is generally recommended, VHL patients at lower metastatic risk of pancreatic NET should be spared the risks of operative resection.
