Interventional ultrasound-guided procedures in pancreatic pseudocysts, abscesses and infected necroses - treatment algorithm in a large single-center study. Through a time period of 5 years, all consecutive patients were documented in this prospective single centre observational clinical study to investigate feasibility and outcome of ultrasound(US)- and EUS-guided drainage of symptomatic non-infected pancreatic pseudocysts and abscesses as well as the endoscopic debridement of infected necroses.From 03 / 23 / 2002 to 12 / 31 / 2008, 147 patients (females:males = 49:98 [1:2.0]) with pseudocysts (n = 32), abscesses (n = 81) and necroses (n = 34) were enrolled in the study. Technical success rate in US-guided external and in EUS-guided transmural drainage was 100 % and 97.0 %, respectively, whereas that of transpapillary (ERP-guided) drainage was 92.1 %. While the complication rate in external drainage was 3.7 %, this rate in transmural and transpapillary drainage was 9.6 % and 0, respectively. Late complications (> 24 h) were observed in 6.4 % of patients after transpapillary drainage (external drainage, 5.6 % transmural drainage, 19.1 %). Complications in 5 cases (bleeding, n = 3US- and endoscopy-based management of pancreatic lesions as reported is suitable and favorable also in daily clinical routine since it is a safe and efficacious approach in experienced hands.
