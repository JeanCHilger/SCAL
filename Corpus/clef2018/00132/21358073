High intensity focused ultrasound ablation: a new therapeutic option for solid tumors. Surgery has been the standard of care in selected cases with solid tumors. However, a majority of patients are unable to undergo surgical resection because of the tumor sites, advanced stages, or poor general condition. High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a novel non-invasive technique that is capable of producing coagulative necrosis at a precise focal point within the body, without harming overlying and adjacent structures even within the path of the beam. Diagnostic ultrasound was the first imaging modality used for guiding HIFU ablation in the 1990 s. Over the last decade, thousands of patients with uterine fibroids, liver cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, bone tumors, renal cancer have been treated with ultrasound imaging-guided HIFU (USgHIFU) worldwide. This USgHIFU system [Chongqing Haifu (HIFU) Tech Co., Ltd., Chongqing, China] was first equipped in Asia, now in Europe. Several research groups have demonstrated that HIFU is safe and effective in treating human solid tumors. In 2004, the magnetic resonance guided focused ultrasound surgery (MRgFUS) was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical treatments of uterine fibroids. We conclude that HIFU offers patients another choice when no other treatment available or when patients refused surgical operation. This technique may play a key role in future clinical practice.
