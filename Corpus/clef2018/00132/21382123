Hepatic and pancreaticobiliary MRI and mr cholangiopancreatography with and without secretin stimulation in normal cats. Magnetic resonance (MR) cholangiopancreatography is useful in humans to diagnose biliary and pancreatic diseases. Some of these protocols incorporate the use of secretin, which stimulates the exocrine pancreas to release bicarbonate with secondary dilation of the pancreatic duct. We compared the utility and quality of multiple hepatic-pancreaticobiliary MR imaging sequences before and after secretin stimulation of the pancreatic duct in five healthy cats. Multiple MR sequences were evaluated, including fast Spoiled Gradient Recalled in- and out-of-phase, Single Shot Fast Spin Echo (SSFSE), T2 Fast Spin Echo, MR cholangiopancreatography (pre- and postsecretin administration), and Fast Acquisition with Multiphase Efgre (FAME) (postsecretin and before and after gadolinium administration). The MR cholangiopancreatography protocol with secretin stimulation was feasible and yielded high-contrast maps of the biliary ductal anatomy but the pancreactic duct was seen inconsistently. The FAME series most consistently provided visualization of biliary and postsecretin pancreatic ductal anatomy, combined with very good depiction of the liver and pancreas. The remaining sequences each had satisfactory utility and diagnostic quality, with the exception of the SSFSE sequences. Secretin improved the conspicuity of the pancreatic duct.
