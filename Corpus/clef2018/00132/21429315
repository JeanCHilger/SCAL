Report of a case with Johanson-Blizzard syndrome and literatures review. To study the clinical characteristics and diagnosis of the Johanson-Blizzard syndrome.The clinical characteristics and diagnosing procedure of 1 case with Johanson-Blizzard syndrome were analyzed, and genetic analysis was made in diagnosing procedure, and 28 cases of Johanson-Blizzard syndrome with detailed clinical data were reviewed and analyzed.A one year and nine months old girl, who was initially admitted to the hospital because of fatty diarrhea and increased frequency of defecation. Imperforate anus, and aplastic alae nasi was noticed after birth. On physical examination, short stature, mental retardation, tooth abnormalities and scalp defects were observed.
