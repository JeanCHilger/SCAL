Two cases of localized autoimmune pancreatitis that relapsed after surgical treatment. Since the revision of Clinical Diagnostic Criteria for Autoimmune Pancreatitis (AIP) 2006, many cases of localized AIP have been reported. Localized AIP is often difficult to preoperatively differentiate from pancreatic carcinoma. We present two cases of localized AIP that developing relapse after surgical treatment. Swollen hilar lymph nodes of lung was detected on CT in both two cases. Recently, AIP is thought to be the pancreatic manifestation of an IgG4 related systemic disease, which has been associated with many extrapancreatic lesions. Response to steroid treatment and the detection of extrapancreatic lesions may contribute to provide adequate diagnosis thereby avoiding unnecessary surgery.
