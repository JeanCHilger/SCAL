Correlation between ultrasonographic findings and pathological diagnosis of mucin producing tumor of the pancreas. We reviewed 19 cases of so-called mucin producing tumor of the pancreas ultrasonographically and histopathologically. Conventional ultrasonography could detect 16 cases out of 19 (84%). But its detectability of localized cystic lesion or papillary projection in the cystic lesion was 68%. On the contrary, endoscopic ultrasonography could visualize such changes in 93% of the cases. In the case which have neoplastic change, it is considered that the portion showing papillary proliferation is correspondent to the ultrasonographic findings of irregularity of the wall of the pancreatic duct or thickened septum-like structure. In the cases which are diagnosed as hyperplasia, the cystic lesions are delineated as having smooth and thin septum-like structure.
