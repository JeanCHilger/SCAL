Computed tomography of pancreatic masses. High resolution sequential bolus dynamic computed tomography (CT) has become the modality of choice for the diagnosis, evaluation, and staging of pancreatic masses. The reliable visualization of the pancreatic gland by CT allows detection of small pancreatic masses, as well as accurate morphologic characterization and preoperative staging. Although CT has proven to be the most accurate imaging modality for the detection and diagnosis of pancreatic masses, the presumptive pathologic diagnosis should always be confirmed by appropriate biopsy and histologic examination. The other imaging modalities now play a secondary or accessory role, and are used mainly when the CT examination is equivocal or nondiagnostic.
