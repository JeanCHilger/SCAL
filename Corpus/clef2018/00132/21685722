Combined imaging with multi-detector row computed tomography and diffusion-weighted imaging in the detection of pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive malignant tumor types. Its prognosis is extremely poor without early detection, and an accurate diagnosis with imaging techniques is vital for any chance of long-term survival after treatment. Despite the great technical advances that have been made with various kinds of imaging equipment, detection of pancreatic cancer is unsatisfactory, and new modalities are required. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of pancreatic cancer however, it does not provide anatomic information. Quite often, the necessary spatial correlation of a high-intensity area with anatomic structures is constrained. If it becomes possible to combine the imaging technique of DWI with multi-detector row computed tomography (MDCT), such as is done with positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT), it is expected that the early diagnostic capability will improve. The objective of this study was to introduce combined imaging with DWI and CT into clinical practice to improve the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. In the current report, we demonstrate a clinical attempt to combine DWI on MRI with the anatomical accuracy of MDCT for two patients of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Analysis of these two patients revealed that the combined images corresponded precisely to the operative findings. Thus, the combined imaging with DWI and MDCT is useful for the detection of the pancreatic cancer.
