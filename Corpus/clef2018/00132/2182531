Ultrasound guided pancreatic ductography. Thirteen patients underwent ultrasound guided percutaneous pancreatic ductography during a one year period. In nine cases the procedure was performed after failure of endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) and in four patients ERP was not attempted. Under ultrasound guidance a 22 gauge needle was inserted into the pancreatic duct through a vertical transgastric route. After aspiration of 10-15 ml of pancreatic juice, contrast medium was injected into the pancreatic duct. Opacification was successful in 12 (92%) patients. No significant complications were encountered. The usefulness of the procedure in our country is highlighted.
