Quantitative assessment of normal soft-tissue elasticity using shear-wave ultrasound elastography. The aim of this study was to measure the elasticity of various tissues and report it in kilopascals.The thyroid, submandibular, and parotid glands, masseter and gastrocnemius muscles, supraspinatus and Achilles tendons, renal cortex and pelvis, pancreas, and spleen of 127 healthy volunteers (89 women, 38 men mean age, 37.72 ± 9.11 yearsThe mean elasticity values were determined to be 10.97 ± 3.1 kPa for the thyroid, 10.92 ± 3.1 kPa for the submandibular glands, 10.38 ± 3.5 kPa for the parotid glands, 10.4 ± 3.7 kPa for the masseter muscle, 11.1 ± 4.1 kPa for the gastrocnemius muscle, 31.2 ± 13 kPa for the supraspinatus muscle, 51.5 ± 25.1 kPa for the Achilles tendons, 5.0 ± 2.9 kPa for the renal cortex, 23.6 ± 5.4 kPa for the renal pelvis, 4.8 ± 3 kPa for the pancreas, and 2.9 ± 1.8 kPa for the spleen.Elasticity values were determined for different tissues with shear-wave ultrasound elastography. Further studies comparing the elasticity values of normal and pathologic tissues are necessary to determine the diagnostic role of this technique.
