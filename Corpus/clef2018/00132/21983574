Intraductal papillary-mucinous tumor of the pancreas: difficulties and mistakes of diagnostics and treatment. 15 patients with intraductal papillary-mucinous tumors (IPMT) of the pancreas were observed. Clinical manifestation corresponded with chronic pancreatitis. Ultrasound study, including endosonography, contrast-enhanced computer and magnetic resonance tomography were used in complex observation of the patients. Dilation of main or lateral pancreatic ducts, connection of tumor with pancreatic duct system and absence of septal calcinosis are typical signs in radiodiagnostics of IPMT. Visualization of parietal papillary proliferations and their contrast enhancement are undeniable signs f or neoplastic character of pancreatic duct dilation. Sensitivity of CT, MRТ and endoUS amounted accordingly 66, 83 and 88%. All patients were operated. Extent of operation was determined by morphological character, localization and size of the tumor (pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenal resection was carried out to 6 patients, distal resection including robot-assisted - to 7 patients, midline resection - to 1 patient, duodenum-preserving resection of head and body of pancreas - to 1 patient). Intraoperative urgent histologic study of pancreatic section was carried out by all means. Tumors with borderline degree of malignancy were detected in 4 cases.
