Therapy of paediatric pancreatic trauma. The goal of this clinical study is to evaluate diagnostics and therapeutical strategies for paediatric pancreatic trauma. It is assumed that conservative treatment is at least as good as operative treatment. PATIENTS / MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a retrospective study 36  children with pancreatic trauma treated between the years 1987 and 2010 in the paediatric surgery department of the University Medical Centre Mannheim were included. Injury grades, diagnostics and treatment were evaluated.In a collective of 36  patients with an average age of seven years the following injuries were found: 26  grade 1, three grade  2, five grade  3 and two grade  4 injuries. Eight patients presented with polytrauma, 20 showed additional injuries. Initial levels of amylase and lipase and screening ultrasound were not always sensitive. 18  patients received conservative treatment. The remaining 18  were operated: either exploratory laparotomy and drainage or pancreas reconstruction with inner stenting or distal pancreatic resection were performed. Pancreatic pseudocysts were drained by transgastric stenting.20 years ago blunt pancreatic trauma was usually treated operatively. Today grade 1 and grade 2 injuries should be treated conservatively. Higher graded pancreatic ductal injuries can be managed operatively with ductal stenting and organ conservation. Pancreatic resections are not always necessary. Endoscopic transgastric drainage of persisting pancreatic pseudocysts is also successful in children.
