An exceptional case of choledochocele and pancreas divisum in an elderly man. Choledochocele belongs to type III biliary cysts in Todani's classification and are considered the least frequent cysts in this class. The usual definition of choledochocele is that of a cystic expansion of the distal intramural portion of the bile duct that protrudes into the duodenal lumen. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is one of the tests of choice both for diagnosis and treatment. We report the case of a 77-year-old patient with chronic epigastric pain, nausea/vomiting and episodes of cholangitis due to a choledochocele. Magnetic resonance cholangiography and other radiological procedures (ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance) were not diagnostic. ERCP was essential to diagnosis and treatment since this procedure provided the treatment by means of biliary sphincterotomy.
