Extra-adrenal phaeochromocytoma-a case report of refractory hypertension. There are at least 5% of all hypertensive patients whose blood pressure (BP) remains elevated despite adequate treatment. In these cases, the clinician is forced to search for a secondary cause of the chronic BP elevation. Certain environmental factors are known to induce resistant-hypertension. Additionally, there may be pseudo-resistance occurring or the patient may be suffering from a secondary form of hypertension such as renovascular or endocrinological hypertension (phaeochromocytoma, Cushing's syndrome, etc.). We report a case of extra-adrenal phaeochromocytoma who was on adequate antihypertensive medications but remained refractory to treatment prior to the exact diagnosis.
