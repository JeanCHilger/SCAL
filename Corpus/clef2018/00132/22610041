Lymphoepithelial cyst of the pancreas: comparison of CT findings with other pancreatic cystic lesions. To describe the CT findings of lymphoepithelial cysts (LECs) of the pancreas and to investigate the differential findings between LECs and other pancreatic cystic lesions.Fifty-eight patients with 8 LECs (M:F = 7:1 mean age 55.1 years), 30 serous cystadenomas (SCA) (M:F = 11:1975 % (6/8) of LECs showed an extrapancreatic location than all other cystic diseases in terms of 3D location (p < 0.0001). LECs showed variable outer shape without a significant difference from that of SCAs and pseudocysts (p > 0.05), but LECs showed microlobulated surface more frequently than the MCAs (p < 0.05). LECs showed a variable appearance from unilocular to multi-microcystic. CT attenuation of LECs (21.2 ± 7.1 HU) was higher than that of SCAs and MCAs (p = 0.005). Size of LECs (34.0 ± 10.8 mm) was smaller than that of MCAs (p = 0.040). There was no calcification, pancreatic duct dilatation, or enhancing nodules in LECs.LECs appear as a highly exophytic medium-sized cystic mass with various morphology occurring predominantly in the middle-aged or older male patients.
