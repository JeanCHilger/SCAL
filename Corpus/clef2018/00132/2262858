Pancreatic tumors in childhood: analysis of 13 cases. Pancreatic tumors are rare in children. Over a 20-year period we have treated 13 children with pancreatic neoplasms. There were eight boys and five girls (age range, 4 months to 12 years). Seven tumors were benign, including five insulinomas, and two cystadenomas. Six lesions were malignant (rhabdomyosarcoma, 2 pancreatic carcinoma, 4). Children with insulinoma presented with hypoglycemia and irrational behavior. Three had abnormal insulin:glucose ratios ( greater than 1.0). The tumor was detected by computed tomography scan in three cases, at the time of surgery in one, and with intraoperative ultrasound in one. Surgical treatment included tumor enucleation in four cases and 80% pancreatectomy in one. Mucinous cystadenomas were observed in two patients, ages 4 months and 10 months. Tha latter infant underwent cyst excision alone, resulting in malignant recurrence at 18 months of age and death. The 4-month-old child had a distal pancreatectomy and is alive at 6 years. Two of the four children with pancreatic cancer had unresectable tumors at diagnosis, and were treated by biopsy (ductal adenocarcinoma), irradiation, and chemotherapy. Length of survival was 6 months and 9 months. Two others (ages 4 and 12 years) underwent 85% distal pancreatic resection for pancreatoblastoma and a pancreatoduodenectomy for papillary carcinoma, respectively. The latter is alive and tumor-free at 20 years of follow-up. The former underwent hepatic lobectomy for a 3.0 x 3.0 cm solitary liver metastases and is alive at 6 years with no evidence of disease. One child with rhabdomyosarcoma died of progressive disease, the other is alive with residual disease despite resection and chemotherapy. Most insulinomas can be treated by enucleation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
