Endoscopic ultrasound image enhancement elastography. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) represents an advance in the diagnosis and staging of several diseases. EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration is useful, but technically demanding, and can be associated with complications. Elastography emerges as a useful tool that is based on the knowledge that some diseases, like cancer, lead to a modification in tissue stiffness. Elastography evaluates the elastic properties of tissues and compares images obtained before and after compression to target tissues differentiating benign from malignant lesions. This article reviews theoretical aspects and the methodology of EUS elastography. Clinical applications, mainly in pancreatic diseases and lymph nodes, are analyzed.
