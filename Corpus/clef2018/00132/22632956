Endoscopic ultrasound: contrast enhancement. The development of ultrasound contrast agents has allowed for the evaluation of vascularity in digestive organs by contrast-enhanced endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS). Contrast-enhanced Doppler EUS and contrast-enhancedÂ harmonic EUS (CH-EUS) have improved characterization of pancreatic tumors, lymph nodes, and gastrointestinal submucosal tumors and compliment EUS fine-needle aspiration (FNA) in identifying malignant tumors. Moreover, CH-EUS can be used to identify the target for EUS-guided FNA by clearly depicting the outline of the lesions.
