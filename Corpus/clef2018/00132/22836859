Efficacy of low-fat diet against dyspepsia associated with nonalcoholic mild pancreatic disease diagnosed using the Rosemont criteria. The objective of this study was to examine the efficacy of low-fat diet against dyspepsia in patients who had endosonographic evidence of nonalcoholic mild pancreatic disease.Patients with unknown cause of upper abdominal pain suggesting pancreatic disease without a history of alcohol consumption were prescribed a low-fat diet (<20 g of fat/d) for 4 weeks. Based on endoscopic ultrasonographic findings and the Rosemont criteria, the patients were distributed into those with 5 or more minor features of chronic pancreatitis (suggestive group), those with 3 or 4 (indeterminate group), and those with 2 or less (control group). Patients with major features were excluded. Symptom severity was recorded before and after the diet therapy using a 10-cm visual analog scale. Improvement of symptoms was compared among the 3 groups.Of 45 patients, 14 were in the suggestive group, 18 were in the indeterminate group, and 13 served as controls. Improvement of visual analog scale score was significantly greater in the suggestive group than in the indeterminate group (P < 0.001) and the control group (P < 0.001).A low-fat diet may be effective in patients with dyspepsia associated with endosonographic evidence of mild pancreatic disease, who do not habitually drink alcohol.
