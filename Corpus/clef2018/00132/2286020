Malignant pigmented spinal nerve root schwannoma metastasizing in the brain and viscera. A 46-year-old woman suffered a meningococcal meningitis followed by a rapidly progressive lumbosacral pluriradicular syndrome. Myelography showed multiple nodules on the lumbar radices. A biopsy showed tissue with numerous Verocay-like bodies, spindle shaped and lymphocytoid cells which was diagnosed as schwannoma. There was a small group of polygonal cells with somewhat irregular and hyperchromatic nuclei. Postoperatively, she developed intracranial hypertension and died. CT scan and MRI revealed multiple occipital lesions consistent with metastases. At autopsy the cauda equina showed multiple nodular lesions with morphology comparable to the biopsy. However, pigment producing cells were also present. There were metastases with distinct morphological features in the brain, myocardium, thyroid gland and pancreas. Some consisted of pigmented, large, pleomorphic cells, others of non-pigmented, spindle-shaped and less pleomorphic cells. In this case, the diagnosis of metastasizing pigmented schwannoma is the most plausible hypothesis.
