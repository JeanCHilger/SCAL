Metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma presenting as a "Superscan" on 68Ga-DOTANOC somatostatin receptor PET/CT. PET/CT imaging using Ga-labeled somatostatin analogs has become a popular noninvasive diagnostic modality in the workup of patients with neuroendocrine tumors. A 65-year-old man with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor with confirmed liver metastases on conventional imaging underwent restaging Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT to monitor response to cold octreotide therapy. Previous PET/CT had shown presence of multiple liver and skeletal metastases along with a primary pancreatic tumor showing intense tracer uptake. The present PET/CT study showed an increase in number and uptake of the metastatic lesions suggestive of progressive disease resulting in the appearance of a superscan.
