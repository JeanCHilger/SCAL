Local resection of a gangliocytic paraganglioma near the papilla of Vater. A 69-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with epigastric discomfort. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed a submucosal tumor near the papilla of Vater. Abdominal CT and MRI showed a small, well-enhanced tumor. Endoscopic tumor biopsy was performed before the operation, but pathologic findings showed normal duodenal musosa. Nevertheless, since malignancy could not be ruled out, we resected the tumor with the sphincter of the papilla of Vater, followed by plasty of the orifice for the common bile duct and main pancreatic duct. We identified 3 parts with tumor cells epithelioid cells, spindle cells, and ganglion-like cells. The tumor was diagnosed as gangliocytic paraganglioma of the duodenum. Treatment by resecting the tumor with the sphincter of the papilla of Vater, followed by the plasty of the orifice for the common bile duct and main pancreatic duct, was selected considering the patient's safety and to achieve radical cure.
