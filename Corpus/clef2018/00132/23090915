MRI of the pancreas: problem solving tool. Advances in MR hardware and pulse sequence design over the years have improved the quality and robustness of MR imaging of the pancreas. Today, MRI is an indispensible tool for studying the pancreas and can provide useful information not attainable with other noninvasive or minimally invasive imaging techniques. In the present review, specific cases are reviewed where the strengths of MRI demonstrate the utility of this imaging modality as a problem solving tool.
