Resectability evaluation in pancreatic cancer. Accurate staging of pancreatic cancer is essential in order to select patients, which are candidates for curative resection. Multidetector computed tomography is the best imaging for determination of pancreatic cancer loco regional and distal resectability. Endoscopic ultra sonography has complementary role in small tumours. It can guide regional lymph node puncture for accurate staging. Magnetic resonance with MR angiography can be helpful in determining vascular respectability of pancreatic cancer. The use of laparoscopy with laparoscopic ultrasound has been increased last years in order to avoid unnecessary laparotomy. Positron emission tomography may be useful tool for diagnosing occult metastatic disease. It is still in evaluation.
