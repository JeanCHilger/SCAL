Endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration in pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer mortality for both men and women in the United States. Overall 5-year survival from time of diagnosis is less than 5%. The only meaningful chance for cure results from early detection while the tumor remains resectable without locoregional extension or metastasis. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is uniquely suited to the examination and treatment of the pancreas. Endoscopic ultrasound can provide important information with regard to disease stage including involvement of the mesenteric vasculature, adjacent organ invasion, and regional lymph node metastasis. In addition, EUS is considered the procedure of choice for tissue diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. More recently, EUS has developed therapeutic roles in an array of other clinical situations including EUS-guided fine needle injection, EUS-guided biliary drainage, celiac plexus neurolysis, brachytherapy, fiducial placement, and emerging antitumor agents delivered directly into the tumor.
