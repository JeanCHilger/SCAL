Primary T cell lymphoma of the pancreas: clinical case report. Primary pancreatic lymphomas (PPL) are rare tumors, comprising 1% of extra-nodal lymphomas and 0.5% of all pancreatic masses. Fewer than 150 cases have been reported worldwide, which most commonly are large B cell lymphomas. T cell lymphomas comprise 4% of all PPL and present a 5-year survival rate of 0%. We report the case of a 28 year-old Peruvian woman who presented with a fatal acute cholangitis and a history of insidious weight loss and obstructive jaundice. The CT scan revaled a diffuse heterogeneus mass in the head of the pancreas along with a mildly dilated pancreatic duct and dilated intra and extra-hepatic bile ducts, no liver, splenic involvement, or retroperitoneal adenopathies were evident. An autopsy was performed and the histopathologic investigation confirmed a T cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, CD3+ CD20-.
