Incidental detection of colonic inflammation on PET/CT using 18F-FDG-labeled autologous leukocytes. Labeled leukocyte scintigraphy and (18)F-FDG PET are well-documented techniques for the assessment of inflammatory bowel disease. In this study, a 28-year-old man with abdominal pain, vomiting, and raised serum amylase and lipase levels underwent PET/CT imaging using FDG-labeled autologous leukocytes to assess for pancreatic infection. While the pancreas showed no abnormal tracer uptake, colonic inflammation was incidentally detected, and a diagnosis of pseudomembranous colitis was subsequently confirmed on colonoscopy and biopsy.
