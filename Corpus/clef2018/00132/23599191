Assessment of the severity of acute pancreatitis by contrast-enhanced computerized tomography in 350 patients. This prospective study has been conducted with the aim to assess the severity of acute pancreatitis.The study included 350 consecutive patients with acute pancreatitis admitted over a period of five years. All these patients were subjected to detailed history and clinical examination and investigations to ascertain the diagnosis. The severity was assessed by contrast - enhanced computed tomography (CT). Data collected were tabulated and subjected to appropriate statistical analysis.On the basis of the CT Severity Index (CTSI), the severity of acute pancreatic was classified into Group A (mild), Group B (moderate), or Group C (severe). Group C patients had the most complications (in 77 [91.67%] patients), and Group A patients had the least (in 7 [6.25%] patients). Mortality was found to be highest among Group C (14 [16.67%] patients), indicating the severe nature of disease in these patients, while no mortality was noted in Group A patients. The mean duration of hospital stay of patients in Group A was 9.25 days, Group B 12.0 days and Group C 24.58 days.The use of contrast-enhanced computed tomography as a routine investigation in patients to predict a severe attack of acute pancreatitis early in the course of the disease decreases overall mortality and burden of disease.
