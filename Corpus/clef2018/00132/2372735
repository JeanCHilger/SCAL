Anterior protrusion of retroperitoneal processes. A mimic of lesser sac or gastrohepatic masses. The space between the left lobe of the liver and the lesser curvature of the stomach normally contains intraperitoneal structures. These include the gastrohepatic recess of the greater peritoneal cavity, the medial recess of the lesser sac and the interposed gastrohepatic ligament. An anterior protrusion of retroperitoneum can project into this space, dorsal to the posterior reflection of the medial compartment of the lesser sac. Tumors that extend into this fossa are anterior and medial to the fundic and upper body region of the stomach. These tumors may cause confusion regarding their origin if the radiologist is not aware of the existence of this retroperitoneal protrusion. Between 1982, and 1986, 183 patients with pancreatic cancer were hospitalized at our institution, 63 of whom had computed tomography (CT) scans of the abdomen. Four of these patients (6.3%) demonstrated direct tumor extension anterior to the stomach. During this same period, four large benign retroperitoneal tumors also exhibited this finding. Masses in the gastrohepatic interval between the liver and stomach can be extensions of retroperitoneal processes and should not be assumed to represent intraperitoneal involvement.
