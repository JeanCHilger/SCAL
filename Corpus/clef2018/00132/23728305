Staging accuracy of MR for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor and imaging findings according to the tumor grade. To investigate staging accuracy of MR for pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (PNETs) and imaging findings according to the tumor grade.Our study consisted of 39 patients with PNET G1 (n = 24), PNET G2 (n = 12), and pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma (PNEC) (n = 3). All underwent preoperative MRI. Two radiologists retrospectively reviewed MR findings including tumor margin, SI on T2WI, enhancement patterns, degenerative change, duct dilation, and ADC value. They also assessed T-stage, N-stage, and tumor size. Statistical analyses were performed using Chi square tests, ROC analysis, and Fisher's exact test.Specific findings for PNEC or PNET G2 were ill-defined borders (P = 0.001) and hypo-SI on venous- and delayed-phase (P = 0.016). ADC value showed significant difference between PNET G1 and G2 (P = 0.007). The Az of ADC value for differentiating PNET G1 from G2 was 0.743. Sensitivity and specificity were 70% and 86%. Accuracy for T-staging was 77% (n = 30) and 85% (n = 33), and for N-staging was 92% (n = 36) and 87% (n = 34) with moderate agreement. T-stage showed significant difference according to tumor grade (P < 0.001), although there was no significant difference in tumor size or N-stage.Ill-defined borders and hypo-SI on venous- and delayed-phase imaging are common findings of higher grade PNET, and ADC value is helpful for differentiating PNET G1 from G2. MR is useful for preoperative evaluation of T-, N-stage. Tumor size of PNET and T-stage showed significant difference according to tumor grade.
