Multifocal branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas: magnetic resonance (MR) imaging pattern and evolution over time. The aim of our study was to follow the evolution over time of multifocal intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) of the pancreatic duct side branches by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).A total of 155 patients with multifocal IPMN of the side branches were examined with MRI and MR cholangiopancreatography (MRI/MRCP). Inclusion criteria were patients with â‰¥2 dilated side branches involving any site of the parenchyma presence of communication with the main pancreatic duct and previous investigations by MRI/MRCP within at least six months. Median follow-up was 25.8 months (range, 12-217). Patients with a follow-up period shorter than 12 months (n=33) and those with a diagnosis of multifocal IPMN of the side branches without any follow-up (n=14) were excluded from the study. The final study population thus comprised 108 patients. A double, quantitative and qualitative, analysis was carried out. The quantitative image analysis included: number of dilated side branches in the head-uncinate process and body-tailAt diagnosis, the mean number of cystic lesions of the side branches was 7.09. The mean diameter of the cystic lesions was 13.7 mm. The mean diameter of the main pancreatic duct was 3.6 mm. At follow-up, the mean number of cystic lesions was 7.76. The mean diameter of the cystic lesions was 13.9 mm. The mean diameter of the main pancreatic duct was 3.7 mm. Intraluminal filling defects in the side branches were seen in 18/108 patients (16.6%) enhancing mural nodules were seen in 3/108 patients (2.7%).Multifocal IPMN of the branch ducts shows a very slow growth and evolution over time. In our study, only 3/108 patients showed mural nodules which, however, did not require any surgical procedure, indicating that careful nonoperative management may be safe and effective in asymptomatic patients.
