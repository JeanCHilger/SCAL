Solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas - comparisons between magnetic resonance and histological findings. Solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm is a rare pancreatic tumor typically observed in young adults. A new case of the tumor was diagnosed in a 22-year-old woman. An abnormal mass connected with the pancreatic body was found on ultrasound and computed tomography. Magnetic resonance revealed weak homogeneous contrast enhancement and a low ADC value (0.824 mm/s2 b1000). Primary radiological diagnosis suggested a solid pancreatic neoplasm, which was confirmed during histopathological assessment after resection of the pancreatic body with preservation of the spleen and normal drainage through the main pancreatic duct. Histological appearance of the solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm corresponded with its radiological morphology.
