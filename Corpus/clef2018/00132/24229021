Favorable response after gemcitabine-radiotherapy for invasive pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm: a case report. The efficacy of chemoradiotherapy for invasive pancreatic ductal carcinoma derived from an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) has not been established. The subject of the present report was a 53-year-old man admitted for the treatment of IPMN. The tumor, located in the pancreatic body, was of the mixed type of IPMN, and it involved the branch duct, where it was 38 mm in diameter, and the main duct, where it was 6 mm in diameter. Distal pancreatectomy was performed and the postoperative course was uneventful however, histopathologic diagnosis revealed invasive ductal carcinoma with a positive surgical margin in the pancreatic duct. Although total pancreatectomy was recommended, chemoradiotherapy (50.4-Gy irradiation and gemcitabine) was preferred by the patient. At 9-month follow up, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a cystic mass at the surgical margin of the pancreas. Endoscopic ultrasonography showed a 44-mm cystic lesion with nodules in the remnant pancreas, on the basis of which he underwent total pancreatectomy. Pathologic examination of the resected specimen revealed absence of the epithelium at the surgical margin of the main pancreatic duct, and malignant cells were not detected.
