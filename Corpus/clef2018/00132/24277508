Solid pseudopapillary tumour of the pancreas: distinct patterns of computed tomography manifestation for male versus female patients. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively assess the features of computed tomography (CT) images and clinical characteristics of male patients with solid pseudopapillary tumours (SPTs) and compare them with those of female patients.Computed tomography images and clinical data of 102 patients with pathologically proven SPTs were reviewed. Details of the location, diameter, shape, encapsulation, calcification, internal composition, CT attenuation, and enhancement pattern of tumours were noted. Statistical analysis was performed using the χ (2) and t tests.Data from 16 males and 86 females were collected. Males were significantly older than females (38.5 years vs. 28.7 years P = 0.004). Except for mean age, no significant statistical difference was observed between the clinical factors of SPTs in males and females. The mean tumour size in males was significantly smaller than that in females (5.3 vs. 7.6 cmThe imaging features of SPTs of males are different from those of females. In males, the finding of small, prominently solid tumours showing enhancement patterns typical of SPTs may suggest a diagnosis of SPT.
