Solitary metastasis to the pancreas of renal cell carcinoma : a case report. A 62-year-old man had undergone retroperitoneoscopic radical nephrectomy for left renal cell carcinoma at the age of 57 years. The histopathological diagnosis was clear cell carcinoma of the kidney (G2, pT2a, INF Î²). Five years postoperatively, enhanced computed tomography demonstrated strongly enhanced tumors on the pancreatic head and body. No other metastatic lesion was detected. Pancreatic endocrine tumors were not ruled out. The patient underwent enucleation of the pancreatic head tumor and distal pancreatectomy. The histopathological diagnosis of the tumors was metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Patients with renal cell carcinoma should receive a long-term follow-up to detect possible metastatic lesions other than the common metastatic sites such as the lung and bones.
