Modern approaches to diagnostics and treatment of chronic pancreatitis. This review expounds modern views of diagnostic and treatment of chronic hepatitis (CH). Diagnosis of CH is possible only by precise methods of non-invasive morphological study, such as multispiral CT and/or endoscopic ultrasonography. Severe pain syndrome in CH requires the use of analgesics, pancreatin, tricyclic antidepressants, and anti-oxidant vitamin-mineral complexes. Low effectiveness of such therapy is an indication for surgical and endoscopic treatment.
