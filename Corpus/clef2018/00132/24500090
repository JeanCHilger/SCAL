Intravoxel incoherent motion diffusion-weighted imaging of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: prediction of the histologic grade using pure diffusion coefficient and tumor size. The purpose of this study was to assess the value of intravoxel incoherent motion and diffusion-weighted imaging for predicting the histologic grade of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs).Forty patients with surgically diagnosed PNETs who underwent preoperative magnetic resonance imaging, including diffusion-weighted imaging with a series of 10 b values (0-1000 s/mm(2), were included in this institutional review board-approved retrospective study. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC(total)), the intravoxel incoherent motion parameters (pure diffusion coefficient [D], pseudodiffusion coefficient [D(*)], and perfusion fraction [f]) were measured on the tumors. Histologic grading was performed on the basis of the World Health Organization 2010 classification system. Logistic regression analysis and receiver operating curve analysis were performed to identify the significant factors predicting the histologic grades.Grades 2 and 3 tumors were significantly larger than grade 1 tumors (average 3.62 cm vs 2.17 cm in diameter P=0.001). Grades 2 and 3 tumors showed significantly lower D values than did grade 1 tumors (0.95 vs 1.21Ã—10(-3) mm(2)/sPure diffusion coefficient (D) is possibly a better marker than ADC(total) is for differentiating grade 1 from grade 2 or 3 PNET and, combined with tumor size, can predict grade 1 PNET with a high specificity.
