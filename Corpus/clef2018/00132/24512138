Current options for the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis. The diagnostic options for chronic pancreatitis have evolved over recent years. The previous gold standard references for structural imaging and exocrine pancreatic function testing have both been supplanted and redesigned. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography has now been overtaken by endoscopic ultrasound and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, whilst the old technique for Dreiling tube pancreatic function testing has now been replaced by the endoscopic pancreatic function test. New advances in endoscopic ultrasound elastography have also extended the options for evaluating pancreatic masses to differentiate mass-forming chronic pancreatitis from malignancy. Genetic contribution to chronic pancreatitis is also now more widely recognized than ever before.
