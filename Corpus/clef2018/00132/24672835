CT and MRI findings in patients with autoimmune pancreatitis. To evaluate computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in patients with autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP).The imaging findings of pancreas and extra-pancreas in 24 patients with AIP were retrospectively reviewed. Among them, CT scan was performed in 18 patients, MRI in 11, and bGth CT and MRI in 10.The pancreas showed diffuse enlargement (25%, 6/24), focal enlargement (37. 5%, 9/24), combined enlargement (25%, 6/24) ,and no enlargement (12. 5%, 9/24). Unenhanced CT showed hypoattenuation in AIP area (n = 2) . After intravenous injection of contrast medium, 17 patients showed abnormal contrast enhancement in the affected pancreatic parenchyma, including hypoattenuation during the arterial phase (50%, 9/18) and hyper attenuation during the delayed phase (94. 4%, 17/18). Precontrast MRI showed abnormal signal intense (n =9), including hypointense on T1-weight images (T1 WI) (n = 7), hyperintense (n = 7) and hypointense (n = 2) on T2-weight images (TIWI). Enhanced MRI demonstrated abnormal contrast enhancement within lesions (n = 11), including hypoattenuation during the arterial phase (81. 8%, 9/11) and good enhancement during the delayed phase (100%, 11111). A capsule-like rim was seen around pancreas (37. 5%, 9/24), among which CT detected in 6 out of 18 patients and MRI found in 7 out of 11 patients.The main pancreatic duct lumen within lesions has no visualization (100%, 24/24) and upstream dilation of the main pancreatic duct (n = 8) , ranging from 2. 2 to 4. 5 mm(mean 3. 1 0. 47 mm) in diameter. Narrowing of the common bile duct was shown in 14 patients. Miscellaneous findings were: infiltration of extrapancreatic vein (n = 9) and artery (n = 1) mild fluid collection around pancreas (n = 2)AIP display some characteristic CT and MRI imaging features: sausage-like change of the pancreas capsule-like rims around lesions
