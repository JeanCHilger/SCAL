3-Dimensional histological reconstruction and imaging of the murine pancreas. Visualization of important disease-driving tissues in their native morphological state, such as the pancreas, given its importance in glucose homeostasis and diabetes, provides critical insight into the etiology and progression of disease and our understanding of how cellular changes impact disease severity. Numerous challenges to maintaining tissue morphology exist when one attempts to preserve or to recreate such tissues for histological evaluation. We have overcome many of these challenges and have developed new methods for visualizing the whole murine pancreas and single islets of Langerhans in an effort to gain a better understanding of how islet cell volume, spatial distribution, and vascularization are altered as diabetes progresses. These methods are readily adaptable without requirement for costly specialized equipment, such as magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, or computed tomography, and can be used to provide additional robust analysis of diabetes susceptibility in mouse models of Type 1 and Type II diabetes.
