Emergency contrast-enhanced ultrasonography for pancreatic injuries in blunt abdominal trauma. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively investigate the application of emergency contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) in blunt pancreatic trauma.Twenty-two consecutive patients with blunt pancreatic trauma were examined using CEUS from March 2007 to June 2012. The findings of CEUS were compared with those of contrast-enhanced computed tomography scans at level-1 diagnostic tests.Out of the 22 patients, 21 were diagnosed with blunt pancreatic injury using CEUS, including 8 patients with lesions in the neck of pancreas, 9 in the body, 3 in the tail and 1 in the head. The injury sites appeared as anechoic and/or hypoechoic perfusion defect regions with irregular borders in parenchyma and capsule on CEUS images. The lesion sizes measured by CEUS were 1.88 ± 0.81 cm, which were consistent with the 1.93 ± 0.77 cm measured by CT (p > 0.05). Using CT as a reference standard, the detection rate of CEUS in blunt pancreatic trauma was 95.5 % (21/22).CEUS findings can be used to provide a reliable diagnosis for blunt pancreatic trauma. CEUS is thus promising in the assessment of blunt pancreatic trauma, especially in institutions where emergency CEUS is used as an initial diagnostic instrument.
