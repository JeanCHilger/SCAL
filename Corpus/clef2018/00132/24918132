Multiple orifices are better than single in the endoscopic treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts. The aim of this study was to compare the surgical drainage of large, symptomatic pancreatic cysts (>5 cm) with single- and multi-channel endoscopic drainage.In the period 2005-2010, we treated 112 patients with post-inflammatory pancreatic cysts. Thirty-six patients underwent surgical internal drainage. The remaining group of patients was treated endoscopically. In 28 of them, drainage was performed by anastomosing the cyst to the gastrointestinal tract using a single pig tail drain and then widening the channel to a diameter of 15 mm. Forty-eight patients underwent multi-channel cystic drainage. It consisted of connecting the cyst to the stomach and/or duodenum using at least 3 drains. Each connection was widened to a minimum diameter of 15 mm to ensure free drainage of the morphotic elements of the cyst. Each procedure was preceded by abdominal computed tomography to determine the exact location of the cyst in relation to the gastrointestinal tract and a Doppler ultrasound scan to determine the location of the blood vessels modeling on its surface.In 48 patients with multi-channel drainage, there was no obstruction of the anastomosis, and cysts closed within 4 months. The drains were removed after about 3 months. The created channels were patent for about 3-4 weeks, which was enough to completely close the cyst.Multi-channel endoscopic anastomosis of pancreatic cyst to the gastrointestinal tract is a very effective method for drainage of large post-inflammatory pancreatic cysts, comparable in terms of effectiveness with the surgical method but less invasive.
