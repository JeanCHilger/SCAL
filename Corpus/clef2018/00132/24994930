PET/CT with 18F-FDG-labeled autologous leukocytes for the diagnosis of infected fluid collections in acute pancreatitis. Early detection of infection in acute pancreatitis (AP) affects the choice of treatment and clinical outcome. We used PET/CT with (18)F-FDG-labeled autologous leukocytes to detect infection in pancreatic or peripancreatic fluid collections in patients with AP.Forty-one patients (28 men and 13 women) who were 21-69 y old (mean ± SD, 41 ± 11.5) and had AP and radiologic evidence of a fluid collection in or around the pancreas were studied. Leukocytes were separated from the patient's venous blood, labeled with (18)F-FDG, and reinjected intravenously PET/CT images were acquired 2 h later. A final diagnosis of infection was based on microbiologic culture of fluid aspirated from the collection. Patients were treated with supportive care and antibioticsBlood glucose level, total leukocyte count, neutrophil count, and leukocyte labeling efficiency varied from 83 to 212 mg/100 mL (118 ± 30), 4,600 to 24,200/mm(3) (11,648 ± 5,376), 55% to 90% (73 ± 10), and 31% to 97% (81 ± 17), respectively. Increased tracer uptake in the fluid collection was seen in 12 of 41 patients 10 had culture-proven infection and underwent percutaneous drainage, and aspiration was unsuccessful in 2. The scan results were negative for infection in 29 patientsPET/CT with (18)F-FDG-labeled leukocytes is a noninvasive and reliable method for the diagnosis of infection in pancreatic or peripancreatic fluid collections in patients with AP.
