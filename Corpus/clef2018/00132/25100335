Does secretin stimulation add to magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography in characterising pancreatic cystic lesions as side-branch intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm? To assess the value of secretin during magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) in demonstrating communication between cystic lesions and the pancreatic duct to help determine the diagnosis of side-branch intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (SB-IPMN).This is an IRB-approved, HIPAA-compliant retrospective study of 29 SB-IPMN patients and 13 non-IPMN subjects (control) who underwent secretin-enhanced MRCP (s-MRCP). Two readers blinded to the final diagnosis reviewed three randomised image sets: (1) pre-secretin HASTE, (2) dynamic s-MRCP and (3) post-secretin HASTE. Logistic regression, generalised linear models and ROC analyses were used to compare pre- and post-secretin results.There was no significant difference in median scores for the pre-secretin [reader 1: 1 reader 2: 2 (range -2 to 2)] and post-secretin HASTE [reader 1: 1Secretin stimulation did not add to MRCP in characterising pancreatic cystic lesions as SB-IPMN.Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is used to evaluate pancreatic cystic lesions. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) is a type of pancreatic cystic neoplasm. Secretin administration does not facilitate the diagnosis of IPMN on MRCP.
