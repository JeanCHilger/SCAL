Prior radial-scanning endoscopic ultrasonography training did not contribute to subsequent linear-array endoscopic ultrasonography study performance in the stomach of a porcine model. The optimal training mode for linear array endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) has not been established. Prior radial-scanning EUS training seems to improve subsequent linear array EUS learning. The objective of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate its value in linear array EUS training.In total, 18 freshman trainees conducted hands-on EUS operations on a live pig model. The training contents consisted of visualization and tracking of the pancreas and splanchnic vasculature and performing fine-needle aspiration of the body or tail of the pancreas and celiac plexus neurolysis through the stomach. The trainees were randomized into two groups group A received linear array EUS training after receiving radial-scanning EUS training, whereas group B conducted linear array EUS training alone. Two teachers assessed the competence of each trainee using a scoring system and relevant parameters before and after the training process.Groups A and B showed significant improvement between the pretests and posttests in terms of diagnostic and interventional procedures. There was no intergroup difference in terms of improvement.Prior radial-scanning EUS training did not contribute to subsequent linear array EUS study performance in the pig stomach model thus, this training mode may need to be changed.
