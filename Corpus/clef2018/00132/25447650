A successful case of transcatheter arterial embolization with n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate for pancreatic arteriovenous malformation. A 57-year-old man was referred and admitted to our hospital for treatment of a symptomatic pancreatic mass. Pancreatic arteriovenous malformation (AVM) was diagnosed based on the findings of contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and angiography, and transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) with N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (NBCA) was performed without complications. The patient's symptoms subsequently improved after TAE, and resolution of the pancreatic AVM was detected on contrast-enhanced CT performed six months after the embolization procedure. This case indicates that TAE with NBCA is a safe and effective treatment for pancreatic AVM.
