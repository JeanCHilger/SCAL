Current status of tissue harmonic imaging in endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and EUS-elastography in pancreatobiliary diseases. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) has high spatial and contrast resolution, and is thought to be one of the most reliable and efficient diagnostic modalities for pancreatobiliary diseases. Recent progress in EUS, especially in the development of the electronic scanning method, has enabled the application of several utilities and software of a high-end transabdominal ultrasound apparatus as an image-enhanced EUS. Tissue harmonic imaging (THI) is a novel US acquisition method that provides better US images by using second harmonic signals. The potential advantages of THI are improved lateral resolution, reduced side lobe artifact and an increased signal-to-noise ratio. EUS-elastography is another novel technique that provides information about the distributed pattern of tissue hardness. Clinical benefits of EUS-elastography for the differential diagnosis of pancreatic tumors and the evaluation of pancreatic fibrosis have been reported. It is necessary to develop a unified and objective method of imaging and analysis to increase the use of EUS-elastography in the future.
