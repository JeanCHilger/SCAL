False-Positive PET/CT After Cyanoacrylate Sealing of a Pancreaticojejunostomy. In 2013, a 68-year-old male had a pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer. The pancreaticojejunostomy was sealed with cyanoacrylate (Dermabond) to prevent postoperative pancreatic fistula. Local recurrence of malignancy at the anastomosis was suspected 18 months later in PET/CT. Surgical revision was performed and anastomosis resected. However, histology showed no tumor recurrence, but strong inflammation and foreign-body reaction towards Dermabond. The sealant caused false-positive PET/CT findings, so its use in oncologic surgery should be abandoned.
