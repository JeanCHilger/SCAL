Associations Between Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D, Insulin Sensitivity, Insulin Secretion, and β-Cell Function According to Glucose Tolerance Status. The objective of this study was to determine whether glucose tolerance status influences the associations between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, and β-cell function.This cross-sectional study included 112 French Canadian postmenopausal women with normal glucose tolerance (NGT n = 65) or abnormal glucose tolerance (AGTAGT status was significantly associated with lower insulin sensitivity and β-cell function (P ≤ 0.01 for all) but not with insulin secretion. Lower serum 25(OH)D concentrations were significantly associated with lower insulin sensitivity and secretion (P ≤ 0.01 for all) but not with β-cell function. The interaction between glucose tolerance status and serum 25(OH)D concentration was not significant for either insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, or β-cell function, even after adjustment for potential confounders.Vitamin D and glucose tolerance status are both independently associated with measures of insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, and β-cell function. However, the association between serum 25(OH)D and these surrogate markers of type 2 diabetes mellitus risk is not influenced by glucose tolerance status.
