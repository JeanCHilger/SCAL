18F-FDG activitiy PET/CT and CA-19.9 levels for the prediction of histopathological features and localization of peri- ampullary tumors. We sought to investigate the roles of maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) in predicting the histopathological features of periampullary tumors.Thirty-four patients with histologically confirmed periampullary tumors were classified into two groups, according to the localizations of their tumors (ampulla Vateri or pancreas). SUVmax was obtained from [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT). SUVmax and CA 19-9 levels were measured and compared with histopathological features of the tumors. Logistic regression was used to assess the significance and independence of predictive factors.18F-FDG PET/CT SUVmax (<2.5 vs. â‰¥2.5 p=0.031) and CA 19-9 level (normal vs. elevatedA surgical approach to treatment may be considered for patients who have both i) an established or suspected diagnosis of periampullary tumors and ii) low SUVmax and CA 19-9 levels.
