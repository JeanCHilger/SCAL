Diagnostic imaging of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (pNEN): tumor detection, staging, prognosis, and response to treatment. Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (pNEN) are rare malignancies arising from neuroendocrine cells of the pancreas. Functional tumors can present with specific clinical syndromes due to hormonal secretion. These tumors can present as incidental findings on imaging performed for unrelated purposes or they are diagnosed when workup is initiated in patients with specific syndromes or metastases. This article presents an overview of available imaging techniques focusing on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Recommendations regarding examination protocols are given. Typical imaging features of pNEN and metastases are described. Their potential value for the evaluation of prognosis as well as tumor response under treatment is discussed.
