Diagnosis and treatment of duodenal gastrointestinal stromal tumors. In order to promote clinical capability on duodenal gastrointestinal stromal tumor(GIST), literature review and experience summary were documented in this paper. Duodenal GIST is not rare in clinical practice. With the similar pathologic conditions, GIST in duodenum present a higher malignant risk than that in stomach. The cases who would receive imatinib mesylate as preoperative therapy require a precise preoperative diagnosis obtained by endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration cytology. Therapeutic strategy should be based on surgical R0 resection with clear margins, preserving pancreatic function and avoiding adjacent organs resection when possible. Limited resection is appropriate and results in similar oncological outcome compared with extensive procedure in suitable cases.
