Present possibilities of surgical treatment of chronic pancreatitis. The author gives an account of his experience with 54 operations in the algic form of chronic pancreatitis in 1982-1986. Based on examination of patients by modern visualization methods of the pancreas (USG, CT, ERCP), the ductal or parenchymatous form of chronic pancreatitis was diagnosed. In the ductal form of chronic pancreatitis (enlarged pancreatic duct) drainage operations were performed in 43 patients (pancreatojejunostomy in 24 patients and cystogastrostomy in 19 patients). In the parenchymatous form (a senotic pancreatic duct) resections were made (distal resection duodenopancreatectomy and 95% - pancreatectomies). Check-up examinations 1-5 years after operation revealed disappearance of pain in 90% of the patients.
