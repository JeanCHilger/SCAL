Metastases to the Pancreas: Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrum and Clinical Features: A Retrospective Study of 18 Patients With 36 Metastases. The aim of this study is to identify the key computed tomography (CT) imaging findings and clinical characteristics of pancreatic metastases for its differential diagnosis. CT images and clinical features of 18 patients with 36 histopathologically proven pancreatic metastases were retrospectively reviewed. The primary malignancy included non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (n = 7), gastrointestinal carcinoma (n = 5), renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (n = 3), osteosarcoma (n = 1), cardiac sarcomas (n = 1), and neuroendocrine ethmoid sinus carcinoma (n = 1). Pancreatic metastases were metachronous in 12 patients (ranging from 4 to 72 months). Tumor markers were elevated for 8 patients, of which 7 patients had NSCLC and gastrointestinal carcinoma, and 1 patient had osteosarcoma. Metastases from NSCLC and gastrointestinal carcinoma frequently presented as small well-circumscribed lesions, with homogeneous or rim enhancement, and or local pancreatic infiltration instead of focal mass, mimicking local pancreatitis. Neuroendocrine ethmoid sinus carcinoma affecting the pancreas also exhibited local pancreatic infiltration. Metastases from RCC and cardiac sarcomas had typical characteristics of hypervascular lesions. Osteosarcoma metastasizing to pancreas had special manifestation, that is, cystic lesion with thick wall and calcification. Although pancreatic metastases have a broad spectrum of CT appearances, lesions from some types of primary tumors exhibited characteristic imaging features, which, in combination with oncological history, will contribute to correct diagnosis.
