Hemosuccus pancreaticus: a rare complication of chronic pancreatitis. Hemosuccus pancreaticus is a very rare cause of gastrointestinal bleeding and it should be considered in every patient with history of chronic pancreatitis who presents with acute or intermittent gastrointestinal haemorrhage. A 54-year-old man with a history of chronic alcoholic pancreatitis was admitted to hospital for an acute exacerbation. During hospital stay, he presented with haematemesis and haemodynamic instability. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a blood clot on Vater papilla. CT investigation showed a 4 cm cephalopancreatic pseudocyst and angiography identified a large pseudoaneurysm of the right gastroepiploic artery, bleeding into the pseudocyst-hemosuccus pancreaticus. Microcoil transcatheter embolisation was performed with success.
