Retrospective analysis of short term outcomes after spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy for sodid pseudopapillary tumours. Solid pseudopapillary pancreatic tumour (SPN) is a rare pancreatic tumour representing 0.1%-3% of all exocrine pancreatic tumours. Most SPN show benign and low-grade malignant behaviour malignant degeneration is observed in 10-15% of the patients. More than 40% of SPN involve the tail of the pancreas leading to a minimal invasive distal pancreatectomy approach. In this report we present the case of a young 22 Caucasian woman suffering from SPN who successfully underwent laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy. Postoperative course was uneventful. A CT scan control at six months was negative for recurrences. We have also made an analysis of all the laparoscopic treatment of SPN reported in English literature.
