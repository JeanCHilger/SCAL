CT contrast enhancement correlates with pathological grade and microvessel density of pancreatic cancer tissues. Pancreatic cancer typically carries a poor prognosis, and new methods of diagnosis and treatment are needed to improve outcomes for the disease. Non-invasive imaging techniques that accurately predict disease severity may aid in the treatment of pancreatic cancer patients. This study sought to investigate the correlation between computed tomography (CT) contrast enhancement and the histopathological grades and intratumoral angiogenesis in pancreatic carcinoma. The study included 54 patients with pancreatic carcinoma who underwent surgical resection in our hospital. All participants received a CT scan with contrast enhancement before surgery. Pathological specimens obtained during surgery were paraffin embedded for immunohistochemistry to assess microvessel density (MVD CD31 staining) and angiogenesis activity [vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) staining]. Results were analyzed using t tests and Spearman correlation. CT enhancement of pancreatic tumors was negatively correlated with the pathological grade (rs=-0.784, P<0.05) and the MVD count in tumor hot spots (rs=-0.790, P<0.05). Additionally, the pathological grade positively correlated with MVD count (rs=0.516, P<0.05). However, there was no correlation between pathological grade and VEGF expression (rs=-0.195, P>0.05). Finally, MVD was higher in individuals positive for VEGF expression than in those negative for VEGF expression (P<0.05). Thus, the extent of CT enhancement is related to the MVD in tumor hot spots and the malignant degree of pancreatic carcinoma. This suggests CT can be used to reflect the disease severity and extent.
