SUCCESSFUL INGUINAL ORCHIECTOMY IN A PATIENT WITH A PAINFUL METASTATIC SPERMATIC CORD TUMOR: A CASE REPORT. A 71-year-old man was referred to our department due to inflammation in the right scrotum. A tumor in the right spermatic cord was suspected on palpation, and abdominal computed tomography revealed a 4-cm mass in the tail of the pancreas and a low-density lesion in the liver segment 6. In addition, the patient's serum level of CA19-9 was high, at 135.7 U/mi. We referred the patient to our institution's Department of Gastroenterology, where he was diagnosed as having a liver metastasis from pancreatic cancer. Despite three courses of gemcitabine and erlotinib combination therapy for pancreatic cancer, his serum level of CA19-9 increased to 744.0 U/m, indicating no response to chemotherapy. Because uncontrollable pain developed in the right scrotum and right inguinal area during the course of treatment, inguinal orchiectomy was performed for pain management and pathological diagnosis. Careful examination revealed a hard, whitish tumor occupying the right spermatic cord and extending from the epididymis to the internal inguinal ring. Because a palpable mass in the peritoneum near the internal inguinal ring was detected, part of the peritoneum was resected concurrently. Pathological findings were remarkable with spermatic cord metastasis and peritoneal dissemination from pancreatic cancer. Pain subsided postoperatively and no analgesics were needed. Pancreatic cancer accompanied by spermatic cord metastasis and peritoneal dissemination is extremely rare. Surgical resection in the present case provided effective treatment of the intractable pain due to spermatic cord metastasis. To the best of our knowledge, this is only the 14th case reported in Japan of spermatic cord metastasis from pancreatic cancer as a primary cancer.
