Pseudocysts of the pancreas: diagnostic and therapeutic protocols. Notes on 10 treated cases. Pancreatic pseudocysts are a rare pathology in pancreas diseases. Their incidence has been increasing in recent years and the man-woman ratio is equal. The aetiopathogenetic mechanism is attributable to dilation of the pancreatic ducts with later formation of a cyst due to blocked flow. Symptomatology is bound up prevalently to the presence of an expanding abdominal mass. Surgery is the therapy of choice.
