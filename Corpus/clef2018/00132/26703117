Comparison of the multidetector-row computed tomography findings of IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. To compare the multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT) findings of IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis (IgG4-SC) and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (EH-CCA).Two radiologists who had no knowledge of the patients' clinical information retrospectively evaluated the CT findings of patients with IgG4-SC (n=33) and EH-CCA (n=39) on a consensus basis. Another radiologist measured the biliary lesions. IgG4-SC was diagnosed using the Japan Biliary Association criteria (2012) or the Mayo Clinic's HISORt criteria. EH-CCA was diagnosed based on surgical findings.Compared with EH-CCA, IgG4-SC exhibited the following findings significantly more frequently: (a) wall thickening alone, (b) concentric wall thickening, (c) smooth inner margins, (d) homogeneous attenuation in the arterial phase, (e) a lesion involving the intrapancreatic bile duct, (f) smooth outer margins, (g) fully visible lumen, (h) a funnel-shaped proximal bile duct, (i) skip lesions, and (j) abnormal pancreatic findings. Conversely, (k) dual-layered attenuation in all phases was significantly more common in EH-CCA. The specificity values of parameters (e-k) were >80%. Regarding dimensions, (l) the biliary lesions were longer in IgG4-SC than in EH-CCA. (m) The diameters of the dilated proximal common bile duct and (n) the dilated proximal intrahepatic bile duct were smaller in IgG4-SC than in EH-CCA.A number of CT findings are useful for differentiating between IgG4-SC and EH-CCA. CT findings (e-k) are particularly useful for this purpose.
