Liver Metastasis in a Gastric Cancer Patient--A Case of Successful Radiofrequency Ablation Combined with Degradable Starch Microspheres Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization. A 60-year-old male patient underwent curative surgical resection for gastric cancer. After the surgery, the patient was diagnosed with T4b, N3b, ly3, v2, CY0, fStageâ…¢c gastric cancer, and adjuvant systemic chemotherapy using S-1 and CDDP was administered. However, follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan examination taken 2 months after surgery revealed a pancreatic fistula and retroperitoneal abscess, and percutaneous drainage was performed. After 1 month, the enhanced CT scan detected liver metastasis measuring 25 mm in diameter at segment 7. The CT-guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) procedure was performed on the liver metastasis using degradable starch microspheres (DSM). Two months after the RFA, a follow-up CT scan revealed local recurrence of the lesion in the medial side of the ablated area in segment 7. A second CT-guided RFA, which was combined with DSM-TACE, was performed on the recurrent lesion. The patient has since survived more than 2 years after the second treatment without any further recurrences. This case report suggests that RFA treatment combined with DSM-TACE might be a safe and feasible treatment for liver metastasis from gastric cancer.
