A Case of Pancreatic Cancer with Multiple Liver Metastases That Developed Postoperatively and Showed a Complete Response with S-1 Monotherapy. We encountered a case of pancreatic cancer with multiple liver metastases that developed postoperatively and showed a complete response with S-1 monotherapy for a long time. A pancreaticoduodenectomy was successfully performed on an 80- year-old man. Multiple liver metastases developed 6 months postoperatively. Microscopically, the primary lesion was diagnosed as adenosquamous carcinoma with anaplastic carcinoma component, and the final diagnosis was considered to be Stage â…¢ disease. S-1monotherapy (80 mg/day, administered for 4 weeks and then stopped for 2-weeks) was effective. A partial response was noted after 3 months, and 9 months after the initial administration of S-1, a complete response was achieved, which persisted for more than 12 months, according to contrast-enhanced CT evaluations.Serum CEA and CA19-9 levels, which became slightly elevated at the time of liver metastasis development, normalized promptly and remained within normal limits. Adverse effects of chemotherapy of more than grade 2 severity were not apparent, and the patient tolerated the 11th course of S-1 administration, consistently. A standard therapeutic strategy and its outcomes in cases of pancreatic cancer recurrence are not clearly outlined in the Japanese Guideline for the Treatment of Pancreatic Cancer. A case of pancreatic cancer with multiple liver metastases that developed postoperatively and showed a complete response with S-1 monotherapy is reported in this paper.
