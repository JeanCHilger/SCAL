Aneurysm of Pancreatic Artery in Association with Celiac Axis Stenosis: Report of a Case and Review of the Literatures. A 63-year-old Japanese woman with a history of pemphigus was referred to us for abnormal findings of dynamic abdominal CT where three aneurysms of splenic artery and pancreaticoduodenal artery, celiac axis compression, and gall stone. Superior mesenteric artery supplied hepatic arterial flow via pancreaticoduodenal artery. Avoiding transarterial embolization to prompt arterial ischemia of liver/pancreas head/duodenum, she laparotomically underwent cholecystectomy, splenectomy, transection of median arcurate ligament, and ligation of splenic and inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery all at once. Postoperative course was uneventful except drainage of abdominal abscess, and she remained well without aneurysm recurring 40 months post. Important point of treatment for pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysm associated with celiac artery occlusion/stenosis is both preventive solutions for rupture of aneurysm and hepatic/duodenal/pancreatic arterial ischemia. Remaining main arterial supply for the liver via pancreaticoduodenal artery from superior mesenteric artery would prompt recurrent aneurysm of pancreaticoduodenal artery. When a clinician encounters a case of pancreatic aneurysm associated with celiac axis occlusion, the case should be treated using with multimodality such as interventional radiology, and vascular surgery.
