CT and MR imaging of advanced Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. The CT and magnetic resonance (MR) findings in 13 patients with advanced Zollinger-Ellison syndrome are described. In eight patients (62%) one or more primary tumors were found with both methods. All patients with proven liver metastases (n = 7) were identified by MR. Computed tomography was positive in six of these patients. Three patients with lymph node metastases were identified on CT and MR and one patient had bone metastases. Computed tomography and MR were inferior to selective arteriography in the detection of multiple lesions of the pancreas in a patient with multiple endocrine neoplasia-I syndrome. On the T1-weighted MR images, the primary tumors demonstrated no consistency with regard to their signal intensity relative to the adjacent pancreatic parenchyma. All gastrinomas had an increased relative signal intensity on the T2-weighted images with the exception of a calcified tumor. Liver and lymph node metastases had a low signal intensity on the T1-weighted images and an increased signal intensity on the T2-weighted images. The signal intensity of primary tumors and metastases was independent of size. In conclusion, MR was able to detect abnormalities based on its outstanding lesion/normal tissue contrast, whereas CT diagnosis was based mostly on contour distortion. For the current technique, MR is considered at least equal to CT.
