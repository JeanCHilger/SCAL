A case of the pathogenesis of choledochocele in relation to dysfunction of the sphincter of Oddi. A 47-year-old woman was admitted for evaluation of pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Seventeen years previously, she had undergone cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) showed a cystic dilatation of the terminal portion of the common bile duct (CBD) protruding into the duodenal lumen and delaying the drainage of contrast medium. In this patient the CBD and the pancreatic duct appeared to be unimportant in the formation of the cyst. Repeated changes in the radius of the cyst suggested dysfunction of the ampullary component of the sphincter of Oddi, with maintenance of normal function of the common duct component. The pathogenesis of the choledochocele in this patient is discussed in relation to dysfunction of the sphincter of Oddi. In addition, 2 criteria for the diagnosis of choledochocele by ERCP are proposed: [1] cystic dilatation of the terminal portion of the CBD protruding into the duodenal lumen, and [2] absence of the narrow segment of the CBD.
