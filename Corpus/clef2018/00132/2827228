Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: diagnosis and staging with dynamic CT. The authors assessed the accuracy of dynamic computed tomography (CT) in diagnosis and staging of ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and analyzed the survival rates of patients with resectable and unresectable tumors. A correct diagnosis based on CT findings was made in 159 of 174 patients (91%) with 13 false-positive (8%) and two false-negative diagnoses (1%). The 13 false-positive diagnoses highlight the need for confirmation of diagnosis with biopsy. The accuracy of staging with CT was compared with that of angiography (42 patients) and surgery (51 patients). CT was more accurate than angiography in demonstrating tumor involvement of major peripancreatic vessels. Staging criteria were reliable: No unresectable tumors based on CT findings were found to be resectable during surgery (42 patients), while only three of nine resectable tumors based on CT findings were found to be unresectable. Thus, no tumors were incorrectly staged, which would potentially deny surgery for a patient. The average survival rate after resection was 14 months, while the survival rates after palliative (biliary or gastrointestinal bypass) or no treatment were 8 months and 5 months, respectively.
