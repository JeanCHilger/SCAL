"Bi-digital o-ring test molecular identification and localization method" and its application in imaging of internal organs and malignant tumors as well as identification and localization of neurotransmitters and micro-organisms--Part 1. Using the "Bi-Digital O-Ring Test Molecular Identification and Localization Method," one can identify and localize minute amounts of bioactive substances (including neurotransmitters), micro-organisms, toxic substances, or drugs, and, in addition, one can non-invasively image normal organs as well as screen for and image the distribution of specific types of cancer of specific internal organs without using any expensive instrumentation. One can also use this method to perform a qualitative analysis of neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, and hormones on different parts of the imaged organs. The molecule or substance being investigated is compared with a minute amount of a pure control reference substance, and if the substance identical to the control reference substance exists, then the electro-magnetic waves emitted by the identical substance will produce an electro-magnetic resonance phenomenon with the electro-magnetic waves of identical resonance frequency emitted by the control reference substance, and this resonance phenomenon is hypothesized to be the basis of the "Bi-Digital O-Ring Test Molecular Identification and Localization Method." The following substances have been used as control reference substances to identify and localize identical substances in vitro and in vivo: pure neurotransmitters (e.g. serotonin, beta-endorphin, methionine-enkephalin, norepinephrine, dopamine, L-dopa, substance P, etc.), as well as L-tryptophan and L-tyrosine cholesterol
