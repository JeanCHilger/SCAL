Surgical management of alimentary tract duplications. Alimentary tract duplications are unusual anomalies that may require surgical intervention in the neonate, infant, and occasionally in the older child. The clinical presentation of patients with alimentary tract duplications includes bleeding, abdominal pain, intussusception, and respiratory distress, or it may be an incidental finding on either abdominal examination or chest x-ray. A review of 96 patients with 101 duplications seen over the last 37 years is reported herein. Twenty-one duplications were confined to the thorax three were thoracoabdominal, and 77 were abdominal. Seventy-four patients presented as infants less than 2 years of age, and 22 patients were older. Ectopic gastric mucosa was found in 21 duplications, and pancreatic tissue was found in five. Seventy-five duplications were cystic and 26 were tubular. Ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), and myelography are helpful diagnostic tools. Ninety-four of the 96 patients underwent surgical management for their duplications. One duplication was found at necropsy, and one patient was asymptomatic and did not undergo operation. A single death occurred in a 2-day-old infant who had intrauterine volvulus and meconium peritonitis. Management was based on the age and condition of the patient, the location of the lesion, whether it was cystic or tubular and communicating with the true intestinal lumen, and whether it involved one or more anatomic locations. Generally, total excision was preferred, but staged approaches were sometimes necessary.
