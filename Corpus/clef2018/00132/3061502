Ultrasonically-guided diagnostic punctures in pancreatic and adrenal diseases. This study is based on the results of 38 punctures of adrenal and 62 punctures of pancreatic lesions measuring 1.5 to 12 cm (mean size: 4 cm in the pancreas 6.5 cm in the adrenal glands). We used a free-hand technique with a mechanical sector probe. In the pancreas, the sensitivity of cytology is 67%, the specificity 100%. This low sensitivity is due to the difficulty in obtaining an adequate specimen when the tumor is predominantly fibrous. In the adrenal glands, the sensitivity is 90% and the specificity 100%. The results of our study are comparable to other series of guided punctures with US or CT reported in the literature. Microbiopsies with cutting needles can increase the sensitivity of the method in case of pancreatic tumors.
