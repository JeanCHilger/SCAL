Correlation of the cytologic, endoscopic and echographic findings in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. The cytologic, endoscopic and echographic findings in 28 patients with pancreatic cancer are compared. The echographic findings indicated the presence of pancreatic cancer in 4 patients only, in 9 patients they were considered as suspicious for cancer and in 15 patients they did not discover the tumor. The endoscopic examinations revealed a pancreatic tumor in 8 patients and in 10 patients only indirect data for tumor were found. The cytologic examination of the pancreatic juice sediment found cancer cells in 26 out of the 28 patients studied. In 4 patients the diagnosis was determined by cytologic examination only. The simultaneous application of all three methods led to the correct diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in all 28 patients while they were still alive.
