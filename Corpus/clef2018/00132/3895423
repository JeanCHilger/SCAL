Is a timely diagnosis possible in pancreatic cancer?. The incidence of pancreatic cancer, the incidence rate of physicians in a given area, the sensitivity and specificity of morphological (ERCP, CT, sonography), cytological and serological (CEA, alpha-fetoprotein, POA, R-nase, LAI, CA 19-9) examination methods were used (taking the cities of Ulm and Hannover as basis) for calculating that a general practitioner, or a practising internist, may be able to diagnose a case of pancreatic cancer about 3-4 times during his professional career, and at the most once only one early cancer. There is at present no screening method. Diagnosis of an early cancer entirely free from any symptoms, is a mere coincidence. When the first uncharacteristic complaints become manifest, the pancreatic cancer is already 3 to 5 years old usually, it can then no longer be classified as an early cancer.
