Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in the management of pancreatic pseudocysts. The value of ERCP was studied in 25 patients with pancreatic pseudocysts. There were no episodes of sepsis however, acute pancreatitis developed in one patient for an overall complication rate of 4 percent. Results of ERCP were positive in 24 of the 25 patients (96 percent), with filling of the pseudocyst in 17 and pancreatic ductal obstruction in 7. Biliary tract abnormalities were found in seven patients and included common bile duct strictures in four, bile duct dilatation in two, and cystic duct obstruction in one. ERCP also detected six pseudocysts not diagnosed by ultrasonography, five of which were small and resolved with nonoperative therapy. ERCP is a safe diagnostic procedure for patients with pancreatic pseudocysts and may provide important information about coexistent biliary tract disease not otherwise available. It is also sufficiently sensitive to detect small pseudocysts that otherwise would be missed.
