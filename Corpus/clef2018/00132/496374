Computerised tomography of the pancreas with acute pancreatitis. Twenty patients with clinically diagnosed or suspected pancreatitis were examined with computerised tomography. Five pseudocysts and one pancreatic abscess were found as a complication of the disease. Computerised tomography is a non-invasive method of diagnosis in acute pancreatitis and is especially valuable in diagnosing the complications of the disease. Slight swelling of the inflamed part of pancreas and occlusion of the peripancreatic fat were found in mild pancreatitis. Swelling of the perinephric fat and the mesenteric fat were found in five cases of severe pancreatitis. This is a new sign, as well as uneven distribution of the contrast agent in the pancreatic parenchyma.
