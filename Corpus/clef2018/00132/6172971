Cystic neoplasms of the pancreas: CT and sonography. Cystic neoplasms of the pancreas are pathologically divided into macrocystic adenomas and microcystic adenomas, the former are considered a premalignant lesion and the latter without malignant potential. Five cases of cystic neoplasms are presented and the sonographic and/or computed tomographic features of microcystic and macrocystic adenoma are compared. A specific diagnosis can at times be suggested based on the computed tomography and sonography findings. In the proper clinical setting microcystic adenoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a pancreatic mass seen on sonography and computed tomography. Preoperative biopsy with appropriate pathologic staining can be performed and aid in directing appropriate therapy.
