Complementary use  of ultrasound and computed tomography in studies of the pancreas and kidney. 113 cases of pancreatic and renal disease studied by both ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) were analyzed retrospectively. CT provided a diagnosis when pancreatic ultrasound was unsuccessful due to overlying bowel gas or obesity and when renal ultrasound was unsuccessful due to obesity, reverberations from ribs, small lesions, or multiple lesions. Conversely, ultrasound provided a diagnosis when CT was unsuccessful due to lack of fat planes or respiratory motion. CT usualy distinguished carcinoma from pancreatitis when ultrasound showed a focal echogenic mass. CT resolved renal cyst from neoplasm when ultrasound showed a mixed echo pattern mass.
