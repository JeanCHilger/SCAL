Location of an insulinoma by transhepatic phlebography with staged insulin assays (author's transl). Insulinoma was easily diagnosed in a 73-year-old woman who had organic hypoglycaemia associated with hyperinsulinism, but the tumour could not be located by echotomography and computerized tomography. The state of the patient's arteries precluded arteriography. Pancreatic phlebography was carried out by the portal transhepatic route and blood was collected at different levels for plasma insulin assays. A very high gradient at the pancreatic isthmus indicated the site of the tumour, which was found on surgery to be precisely there and could be enucleated. This technique cannot be used systematically to locate insulinomas, but it is unquestionably helpful when the tumour cannot be located by other methods or when these are contra-indicated.
