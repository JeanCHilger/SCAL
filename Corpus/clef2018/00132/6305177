Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging of vasculature of abdominal viscera: normal and pathologic features. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging of intraabdominal vascular anatomy and the effect of various lesions on retroperitoneal and splanchnic vessels was assessed in 67 patients and volunteers using a superconducting magnet (0.35 tesla) and the spin-echo imaging techniques. Because of the low signal generated by flowing blood in most images, blood vessels, including intraparenchymal vessels, were well demonstrated. Clear delineation of the splenic vein facilitated visualization of the normal pancreas and pancreatic masses. Variation in the size and shape of the inferior vena cava and portal venous system reflected constricting and mass lesions. Preliminary observations from this initial experience suggest conspicuity of splanchnic vessels out of proportion to the current spatial resolution of NMR imaging due to the marked natural contrast between flowing blood and solid organs.
