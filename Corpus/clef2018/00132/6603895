Gastroduodenal artery aneurysm: treatment by transcatheter embolization. Aneurysm of the gastroduodenal artery is a rare but well recognized complication of acute and chronic pancreatitis. It appears to be secondary to the proteolytic action of activated pancreatic enzymes on the arterial wall. A case is reported of massive, life-threatening hemorrhage in a patient with a gastroduodenal artery aneurysm. The aneurysm was diagnosed by angiography and treated by embolization with Gianturco coils, the first successful use of this technique. A review of the literature revealed that bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract is a very common clinical presentation and is frequently fatal. Arteriography followed by computerized tomography are the most specific modalities of diagnosis.
