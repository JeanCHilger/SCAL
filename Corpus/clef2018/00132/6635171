Computed tomography of blunt abdominal trauma. Experience with over 500 cases at this institution and reports from other institutions have established CT as an accurate and clinically useful tool in the evaluation of patients with blunt abdominal trauma. Careful attention to technique is essential since artifacts may simulate or obscure traumatic lesions. CT is highly sensitive and specific for parenchymal lacerations and for hematomas of solid and hollow abdominal viscera throughout the peritoneal and retroperitoneal spaces. CT has important advantages over radionuclide scintigraphy, angiography, and ultrasonography and has replaced these imaging techniques in acute evaluation of blunt abdominal trauma at some centers. The use of nontherapeutic exploratory laparotomy and diagnostic peritoneal lavage may also be substantially reduced.
