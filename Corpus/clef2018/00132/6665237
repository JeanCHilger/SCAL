Echographic study of the inferior vena cava in abdominal neoplastic pathology. Comparison with the inferior cavography. The authors evaluated the reliability of echography in the involvement of the inferior vena cava in the abdominal tumors. 137 patients were studied with echography and 125 with inferior cavography too. All the diagnosis were confirmed with arteriography and/or CT and/or surgical findings. The reliability of the echographic method was significant, and particularly in case of emboli and tumor invasion.
