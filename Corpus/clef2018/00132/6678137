Cancer of the pancreas--a clinical study of 22 patients. A retrospective study of 22 patients with cancer of the pancreas seen in a medical department was carried out. The mean age was 61.7 years, although the youngest was only 32 years. Weight loss, pain and jaundice were the most frequent presenting symptoms. Hepatomegaly and jaundice were the most common physical findings. The gall bladder was palpable in 27.3%. Serum alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin and ESR were raised in most cases. Ultrasound examination was done in 72.7% of cases and was diagnostic in 62.5% with 12.5% falsely negative. Five patients had CT scan of the abdomen, of which 4 were diagnostic. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram was positive in all the 8 patients where it was carried out. The cancer was of the pancreatic head in 72.7%. Gallstones were present in 22.7%. Secondary tumour involvement of the liver was present in 40.9%. Laparotomy was performed in 11 patients of which only 2 had a curative procedure (Whipple's operation). The overall prognosis was very poor: 54.5% died during the same admission.
