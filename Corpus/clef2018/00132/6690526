Endoscopic retrograde computed tomography of the pancreas. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and computed tomography (CT) are well established diagnostic studies for pancreatic evaluation. We conducted a study to determine whether performing these examinations in tandem increased diagnostic accuracy. Patients undergoing ERCP with successful cannulation of the pancreatic duct and who could be placed in the gantry of our CT scanner within 30 min were included in the study. The combined examination, or endoscopic retrograde computed tomography of the pancreas (ERCTP), provided additional useful information in several types of patients including those who had intrapancreatic air without clinical abscess, those with apparent total obstruction of the pancreatic duct on ERCP, and those who were post partial pancreatectomy and were being considered for additional surgery. No additional useful information was provided in patients with a normal ERCP or in routine cases of pancreatitis.
