Surgical treatment in acute pancreatitis. The change as influenced by sonography and computer tomography. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is based on anamnestic, clinical and chemical data. Ultrasound and computed tomography permit direct visualisation of the pancreas and establish the diagnosis. In cases of haemorrhagic-necrotising pancreatitis they demonstrate the extent of morphological changes and permit exclusion of other causes of an acute abdomen. The imaging methods support indications for operation in cases of subtotal or total parenchymatous necrosis and in pancreatic abscesses. Conservative expectant approaches in patients with severe clinical course and slight morphological changes as well as in agreement of clinical and morphological findings are facilitated. Complete demonstration of parenchymatous and peripancreatic necroses furnishes useful additional information for total extirpation. Gallstone disease can be demonstrated or excluded preoperatively. Since introduction of ultrasound and computed tomography for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis a marked diminution of early surgical intervention and delayed operation has been achieved.
