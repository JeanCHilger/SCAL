Computed tomography in inflammatory mass lesions following acute pancreatitis. The computed tomography findings in 10 patients with pseudocysts or abscesses following acute pancreatitis are described. Computed tomography was of great value in demonstrating the type and extension of the pancreatic lesion. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was attempted in six cases, and the information gained about the pancreatic disease hardly justified the potential hazards of pancreatic duct filling. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography may be indicated to demonstrate calculi of the bile ducts when other methods have failed.
