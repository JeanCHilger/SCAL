Staging and follow-up of acute pancreatitis by angio-computer tomography (author's transl). First results of angio-computer tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis are reported. Angio-CT allows the display of changes occurring during hemorrhagic-necrotizing pancreatitis in a much more precise manner, than has been possible up to now. Enlargement of organs, changes of contours, exudation and hemorrhage into the retroperitoneal space can be diagnosed after bolus injection of radio opaque viable and well perfused tissue may well be differentiated from necrotic tissue.
