Gray scale ultrasonography in the diagnosis of pseudocysts of the pancreas simulating renal pathology. Ultrasonography has proved to be a reliable tool in the diagnosis of pseudocysts. A case is reported of a patient with a pseudocyst in the transverse mesocolon adjacent to the left kidney and spleen. Initial examination by computerized tomography and angiography failed to visualize the mass, while a renal cyst was simulated on nephrotomography. Repeat ultrasound examinations showed progressive increases in the size of the pseudocyst. This diagnosis was confirmed at operation. We believe that ultrasound is the modality of choice in patients with clinical suspicion of a pseudocyst.
