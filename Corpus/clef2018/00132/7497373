Peripancreatic retroperitoneal gas mimicking necrotizing pancreatitis after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The computed tomographic image of gas in the pancreas and peripancreatic retroperitoneum is strongly suggestive of necrotizing pancreatitis. The authors describe an 81-year-old woman who, 7 days after laparoscopic cholecystectomy, presented with retroperitoneal gas but did not have the clinical or biochemical features of necrotizing pancreatitis. Resolution of her low-grade fever and of the radiologic findings with conservative treatment and the absence of other causes for pneumoretroperitoneum suggest that the gas observed was related to the laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
