Aneurysm of the portal vein associated with aneurysm of the splenic artery. Portal vein aneurysm is very rare. A case of portal vein aneurysm without symptoms of portal hypertension is described. Ultrasonography demonstrated a hypoechoic mass at the isthmic region of the pancreas. Computed tomography demonstrated the vascular origin of the mass. Angiography showed a portal vein aneurysm, measuring 3 cm in diameter, at the junction of portal vein trunk and splenic vein. The association with a splenic artery aneurysm and absence of portal hypertension lead us to suggest that our case is congenital. Non-invasive diagnostic methods are useful to recognize the pathology of portal vein aneurysm and prevent complications especially those related to a possible portal hypertension.
