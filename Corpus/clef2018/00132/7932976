New technique using intraductal ultrasonography for the diagnosis of bile duct cancer. We investigated the extent to which BDca can be visualized and diagnosed via a percutaneous fistula using IDUS. IDUS was performed in 42 cases, including 15 of normal bile ducts 12 of choledocholithiasis, and 15 of BDca. The depth of invasion of the BDca was diagnosed with a 93% accuracy rate by visualizing the EP or MA or both. The infiltration of BDca into the surrounding organs was clearly visualized and diagnosed with an accuracy of 100% in the RHA, 93% in the PV, and 93% in the pancreas. These accuracy rates were higher than those obtained by computed tomography or angiography. We believe, therefore, that IDUS should be further studied as a diagnostic modality for staging malignancy in the biliary field.
