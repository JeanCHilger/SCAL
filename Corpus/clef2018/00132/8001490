Gastrointestinal intramural hematoma, a complication of endoscopic injection methods for bleeding peptic ulcers: a case series. In a prospective study, all patients with peptic ulcer bleeding were documented between February 1984 and April 1992. A total of 227 patients were treated by local injection of epinephrine followed by laser application and injection of polidocanol or fibrin tissue adhesive. In five of these patients, intramural hematomas developing at the former bleeding site one to three days after endoscopic treatment were observed. The presenting symptoms were abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The diagnosis was established by endoscopy, abdominal ultrasound, computed tomography, or laparotomy. In four of our five patients, the bleeding site and hematoma were located in the duodenum. All patients suffered from severe underlying diseases, and showed a clear disturbance of coagulation parameters. In three patients, acute pancreatitis occurred concurrently with the hematoma, probably due to obstruction of the papilla of Vater or compression of the pancreas caused by the hematoma.
