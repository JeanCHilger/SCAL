Clinical role of ultrasound and color Doppler ultrasound in diagnosing pancreatic endocrine tumors. US, EUS, color Doppler US, and color Doppler EUS were performed for five cases of pancreatic endocrine tumors. US was able to detect four cases of five tumors (80%), but could not sufficiently evaluate the internal echo. Color Doppler US was able to reveal the blood flows inside in only one case (25%). EUS was able to detect clearly all five cases (100%), and color Doppler EUS was able to reveal a significant amount of the internal blood flow in all cases. Color Doppler EUS was reflected in hypervascular findings on angiogram and proliferating vascular findings on histology. Therefore, ultrasound, especially EUS was useful for diagnosing the location of the tumor and for evaluating the internal echo, whereas color Doppler EUS was useful for evaluating the vascularity of the tumors.
