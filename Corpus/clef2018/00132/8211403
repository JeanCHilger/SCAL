A pancreatic pseudocyst in the liver. A large cystic formation in the liver of 43-years old woman was identified as pancreatic pseudocyst, using histologic examination during laparotomy. The pancreas was found quite normal without any relation to the pseudocyst. Therefore it seems to be acceptable such a pathogenetic reflection, that the pseudocyst developed as a result of pathologic changes in heterotopic pancreatic tissue (embryonic malformation). The pseudocyst was partly resected and the large cavity in the liver was drained into the small intestine using Roux loop. After 8 months uncomplicated follow-up of the patient, the CT picture of her liver was nearly normal.
