Benign cystic tumors of the pancreas. Benign pancreatic cystic tumors (BPCT) is a rare and little studied pathological condition. By the end of the eighties approximately 500 registered cases of BPCT were described in the world literature, which were those of different morphological variants of cystadenomas (CA). Many scientists note the high probability of malignant degeneration of some CA types. The diagnostic signs and surgical tactics in BPCT are treated ambiguously. The authors systematized the most characteristic signs of pancreatic CA and revealed the possibility of accurate preoperative recognition of these tumors. From rich clinical material (21 cases) the authors show that complications resulting from an erroneous choice of the operation are inevitable. Postoperative complications occurred in 8 patients. The late-term results of the operation were followed-up in 11 patients and were found to be good and satisfactory in complete removal of the tumor. According to foreign authors, cystic carcinomas of the pancreas account for 1-2% ot all primary carcinomas of the organ. Timely radical operation dictated by the specific features of pancreatic cystadenoma is one of the measures of carcinoma prevention.
