Techniques and complications of open packing of infected pancreatic necrosis. Open packing of infected pancreatic necrosis has been used in a disease process that is known to have a high mortality rate. From 1982 to 1991, we managed 15 patients with infected pancreatic necrosis with this technique. The cause of the underlying pancreatitis was ethanol in seven patients, gallstones in four, drug induced in two, trauma in one patient and postoperative in one. At hospital admission, the mean number of Ranson's criteria was 4.5 (range of zero to 11). The diagnosis was made by computed tomographic scan in 13 patients, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in one patient and clinically in one eight patients demonstrated air in the pancreas or lesser sac. Operative d√©bridement of the pancreas was performed by way of a midline incision in four patients and a transverse incision in 11 patients. All wounds were left open or closed partially over gauze packing
