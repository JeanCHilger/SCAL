MR imaging of the pancreas. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging sequences that reduce image artifact in upper abdominal examinations herald a role for MR in the investigation of pancreatic disease. Sequences that have been successful in imaging the pancreas are T1-weighted breath-hold gradient-echo imaging, which avoids phase artifact caused by respiration, and T1-weighted fat-suppressed spin-echo imaging, which reduces breathing artifact, removes chemical shift artifact, and improves dynamic range of signal intensities. Breath-hold gradient-echo sequences provide useful diagnostic information when used prior to and immediately following bolus intravenous administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine. This review addresses current clinically important roles for MR imaging and emphasizes the detection of islet cell tumors, non-organ-deforming pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, and the distinction between chronic pancreatitis and cancer.
