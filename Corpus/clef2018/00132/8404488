Computerized tomography-guided fine needle biopsy. Current perspectives in biopsy diagnosis. 253 cutting needle biopsies from 240 patients (151 men, 89 women mean age 68 [23-84] years) were reviewed. The biopsies were taken under computed (CT) tomography guidance from various parts of the body (pancreas: n = 48, liver: n = 32, other upper abdominal organs: n = 5, mediastinum: n = 27, lung: n = 37, kidney: n = 13, adrenals: n = 8, retroperitoneum: n = 35, pelvis: n = 37, pleura: n = 4, chest wall: n = 6). The data were evaluated retrospectively. In 86% of cases meaningful clinical information was obtained in the form of a definite diagnosis (74%) or of a presumptive or differential diagnosis (12%). As a rule it was possible to assess the degree of malignancy and to ascertain the exact nature of the condition
