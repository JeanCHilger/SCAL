Current surgical approach in the treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts. The paper evaluates the role of surgery in the treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts in the light of current knowledge. The authors underline the important part played by ultrasonography and CT in monitoring the evolution of pseudocysts: ETG on account of its high levels of sensitivity and specificity and CT due to its diagnostic accuracy which is equivalent to almost 100% these methods allow the surgeon to decide if and when to operate.A series of operations were carried out by the authors' division in 15 patients suffering from pancreatic pseudocysts. Emphasis is placed on the high percentage of emergency operations, 40%, due to complicated pseudocysts. External drainage was always used in emergency surgery, whereas in elective surgery it was preferred to use cystojejunostomy with a Roux-en-Y loop, followed by cystogastrostomy cystoduodenostomy was only chosen in one case. The operative mortality rate was 20%.In elective surgery the operation which currently gives the best results is cystojejunostomy with a Roux-en-Y loop, but cystogastrostomy should not be overlooked due to the ease with which it is performed. A recent acquisition is the use of needle aspiration and CT- or ETG-guided percutaneous drainage in the treatment of post-necrotic pseudocysts, therefore after 4-8 weeks' maturity, both in a rapid-growth from and in the event of suppuration. Pancreatic resection is indicated for multiple atypical pseudocysts caused by retention, and this also serves to treat the underlying pancreopathy. Duodenocephalopancreatectomy is now considered to be excessive by the majority of authors. In emergency surgery, drainage of the pseudocysts is the method of choice using either a surgical or percutaneous method.
