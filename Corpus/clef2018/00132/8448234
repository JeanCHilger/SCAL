Tuberculosis of the pancreatic region--sonographic and CT findings. In the case reports of two black men of 29 and 32 years of age the rare condition of tuberculous involvement of the pancreas is described. The diagnosis was established by exploratory laparotomy and by the culture of mycobacterium tuberculosis. Ultrasonography demonstrated inhomogeneous, hypoechoic masses in and around the pancreas. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen revealed enlargement of the pancreas and the presence of lesions of decreased attenuation or cystic collections with involvement of the peripancreatic area.
