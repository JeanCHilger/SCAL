Metastatic gastrinomas: localization with selective arterial injection of secretin. To evaluate localization of hepatic metastases with the intraarterial secretin injection test in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES).Results in 74 patients with ZES (aged 15-70 years) were retrospectively studied. All patients had undergone computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, ultrasound, abdominal angiography, and an intraarterial secretin test, in which venous blood is sampled periodically after injection of secretin.Twenty-two patients had liver metastases. An increase in venous gastrin concentration of at least 25% at 20 seconds or 50% at 30 seconds after injection indicated a positive result. Results were positive in 41% of patients with and 2% without liver metastases (P < .0001). Sensitivity of the intraarterial secretin test was 41% of CT and ultrasound, 64%With the criteria developed, the intraarterial secretin test had high specificity but low sensitivity. It should be used when imaging results are unclear.
