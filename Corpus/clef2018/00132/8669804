Intraductal pancreatic adenomatosis. Apropos of a new case. A 49-year-old diabetic patient with abdominal pain was found upon ultrasonography and computed tomography to have a cystic mass in the head of the pancreas with dilation of the main pancreatic duct. The head of the pancreas and duodenum were removed surgically. Examination of the operative specimen showed chronic pancreatitis, dilation of the main pancreatic duct, and impacted mucus in the secondary ducts with villous proliferation of the ductal epithelium, establishing the diagnosis of intraductal adenomatosis. There was no evidence of malignancy. The resection margin was involved, and consequently the remainder of the pancreas was removed six months after the initial surgical procedure. A review of the literature showed that intraductal adenomatosis tends to spread and carries a high risk of malignant transformation. Surgery is required because of the risk of pancreatic duct obstruction and pancreatic cancer. Intraductal adenomatosis of the pancreas shares many characteristics with other adenomatous proliferations of the gastrointestinal tract (colorectal villous adenoma, bile duct adenomatosis), including presence of villous structures with increased mucus production, a tendency to spread massively, and a high risk of malignant transformation.
