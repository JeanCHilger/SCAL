Prospective study of the detection of anomalous connections of pancreatobiliary ducts during routine medical examinations. It is important to achieve detection of of anomalous connections of the pancreatobiliary ducts (ACPBD), because this condition often leads to pancreatobiliary disease. The present prospective investigation focused on revealing the incidence of ACPBD in asymptomatic individuals undergoing medical checkups.Extracorporeal ultrasonography (US) was performed on all asymptomatic individuals undergoing medical checkups. Identification by abdominal ultrasonography of 3 mm or more gallbladder wall thickening, or 10 mm or more dilatation of the bile duct were considered indicative of ACPBD and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) was carried out in selected cases. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was then performed to confirm the existence of ACPBD.The overall incidence of ACPBD was 0.03% (9/27,076 subjects). ACPBD was found in 23% of cases with bile duct dilatation, and in 2.9% with gallbladder wall thickening.ACPBD was not as rare a disease as expected. For early detection of ACPBD, identification by abdominal ultrasonography of gallbladder wall thickening or dilatation of the bile duct are indicative. Patients who are suspected of having this abnormality should then undergo EUS. The final diagnosis should then be made by ERCP.
