Three-dimensional-CT pancreatography under balloon-ERP in the pancreatic diseases--its method and usefulness. Three-dimensional-CT pancreatography (3D-CTP) under balloon-ERP was carried out in 13 patients with the pancreatic diseases. Tapering stenosis of pancreatic duct in 2 patients out of 2 with pancreatic cancer, shape of cyst and relationship between cyst and pancreatic duct in 7 patients out of 7 with pancreatic cysts, and irregularity of wall of pancreatic duct in 2 patients out of 3 with chronic pancreatitis was reconstructed by 3D-CTP, stereographically. Moreover, the confluence of cyst and pancreatic duct in 3 out of 7 pancreatic cysts did not become clear on balloon-ERP, but it was distinct on 3D-CTP. It is suggested that 3D-CTP is useful in understanding pancreatic diseases stereographically, and can be applied to operative simulation, interventional radiology and differential diagnosis on them.
