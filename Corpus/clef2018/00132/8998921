Endosonographic demonstration of extrapancreatic and extraintestinal gastrinoma. No cause had been found for chronic diarrhoea in a 57-year-old man. Up to 15 watery stools daily had been without relation to food intake and without blood admixture. But muscular cramps had developed, especially in the legs. The patient had a history of recurrent peptic ulcers for which a selective proximal vagotomy had been performed 13 years ago. Physical examination was unremarkable.Alkaline phosphatase activity (182 U/l) and C-reactive protein (9.3 mg/l) were slightly raised serum iron was 42 micrograms/dl, while all other routine laboratory tests, including protein electrophoresis, blood picture and differential count were within normal limits. Gastroscopy revealed ulcerative duodenitis, gastritis with erosions and numerous ulcers and reflux oesophagitis, grade III-IV. Endosonography showed enlarged gastric mucosal relief as sign of foveolar hyperplasia and a ca. 4 x 3 cm tumour next to the duodenal bulb. Gastrin level was 7537 pg/ml (normal < 150 pg/ml). Computed tomography and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy confirmed the site and size of the gastrinoma.Treatment with omeprazole (40 mg three times daily) slightly improved the symptoms. The tumour was excised a week after diagnosis. The patient has been symptom-free since then.Chronic diarrhoea of unknown aetiology can be caused by an endocrine tumour endosonography can often provide information on the diagnosis and location of such a tumour.
