Ampullary carcinoma: demonstration by current MR techniques. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the appearance of ampullary carcinoma using current MR techniques, including fat suppression, gadolinium enhancement, and MR cholangiography. Nine patients with ampullary carcinoma were examined by MRI at 1.5 T. MR examinations included T1-weighted spoiled gradient echo, T1-weighted fat-suppressed, and immediate postgadolinium spoiled gradient echo images for all patients and MR cholangiography for three patients. The imaging features of ampullary carcinomas, including tumor size and morphology, signal intensity, and enhancement characteristics, were determined. Ampullary carcinomas shown on MR images ranged in size from 1.5 to 5.5 cm. Tumors were low in signal intensity on precontrast T1-weighted spoiled gradient echo and T1-weighted fat-suppressed images relative to normal pancreatic tissue and enhanced less than normal pancreas on immediate postgadolinium spoiled gradient echo images. Tumor conspicuity was greatest on immediate postgadolinium spoiled gradient echo images. MR cholangiography demonstrated high grade obstruction of the common bile duct and mild dilatation of the pancreatic duct at the level of the ampulla with abrupt termination of the ducts in two untreated patients and moderate dilatation of the common bile duct in one patient who had a biliary stent. Ampullary carcinomas can be demonstrated on MR images as small masses arising at the ampulla. Tumors are well defined on immediate postgadolinium spoiled gradient echo images.
