Endoscopic ultrasound-guided real-time fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the pancreas in cancer patients with pancreatic lesions. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is an important new tool in the staging of pancreatic malignancies. Using new curved linear-array instruments, real-time fine-needle aspiration biopsy (RTFNA) of pancreatic lesions can be performed.Forty-five patients with pancreatic lesions (22 males and 23 females) underwent staging with the Olympus EUM-20 (Olympus America Corp, Melville, NY) followed by EUS-RTFNA with the Pentax FG-32PUA (Pentax-Precision Instrument Corp, Orangeburg, NY) and the 22-gauge GIP needle (GIP Medizin Technik, Grassau, Germany).EUS tumor stages were as follows: TO, n = 1 T1, n = 8EUS-guided RTFNA is a safe and accurate method for performing pancreatic biopsy. It should be considered in patients with suspected pancreatic malignancies in whom a tissue diagnosis is required or when other modalities have failed. EUS-RTFNA allows for local staging and tissue diagnosis in one procedure.
