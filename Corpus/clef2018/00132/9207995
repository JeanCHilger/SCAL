Intraductal papillary mucinous tumors of the pancreas. Clinical and morphological aspects in 30 patients. Intraductal papillary-mucinous tumors of the pancreas are rare and characterized by a malignant potential. The aim of this study was to clarify their clinical presentation and the performance of different imaging procedures to determine malignancy and tumor extent.Medical records and radiographs of 30 patients with histologically confirmed intraductal papillary-mucinous tumor of the pancreas were reviewed retrospectively. Imaging procedures were compared with pathological data of resected pancreas to evaluate their performances.The most frequent symptom was acute pancreatitis (37%). The onset of symptoms preceded the diagnosis by 2.5 years. Diabetes mellitus and diarrhea were respectively detected in 33 and 23% of the cases. The combination of CT scan, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and endosonography allowed correct diagnosis of intraductal papillary-mucinous tumor of the pancreas in 100% of the cases. Tumor extent could be accurately determined considering the location of cystic dilatation of the pancreatic ducts, the presence of intraductal material or parietal irregularity. Actuarial 2-year survival rate was 43% in patients with malignant tumors. Radiological factors predicting malignancy were: vascular invasion, common bile duct dilatation, stricture of the main pancreatic duct and the presence of solid component in the tumor.The combination of CT scan, ERCP and endosonography provide accurate diagnosis of intraductal papillary-mucinous tumor of the pancreas as well as assessment of tumor extent and malignancy.
