Dynamic fast-gradient echo MR imaging of pancreatic tumours. The purpose of this study was to determine the diagnostic utility of dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pancreas. Twenty-eight adult patients with known or suspected pancreatic tumours were examined. Pre- and post-gadolinium (GdDTPA-BMA) scans were obtained in combination with an oral negative contrast medium (ferristene) to mark the gastrointestinal tract. In 6 cases a more precise diagnosis could be made by dynamic MRI compared to unenhanced MRI. Surgery could confirm the MR diagnosis based on contrast enhancement in 83% compared to 78% for CT. The results of signal intensity (SI) measurements show that a combination of differences in baseline values before enhancement and the slope of enhancement within the first 20 s is a reliable criterion to distinguish between normal pancreas and hypovascular tumours. These tumours already show lower SI values before as well as lower slopes after early enhancement. Mainly two effects facilitate the final MRI diagnosis: (1) the delineation of the pancreas from the duodenum by the negative contrast medium, and (2) the enhancement pattern of pancreatic tumours by gadolinium-enhanced dynamic MRI compared to normal tissue within the early enhancement after contrast injection.
