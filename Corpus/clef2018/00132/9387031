Pancreatic cystic manifestations in von Hippel-Lindau disease. In view of the frequent absence of symptoms related to pancreatic lesions, screening tests for VHL should always include assessment of the pancreas and, considering the frequency of polycystic manifestations, VHL should always be borne in mind in the differential diagnosis of multiple pancreatic cysts, especially when occurring in young patients and in the absence of a positive history of pancreatic disease.Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) is a hereditary disease transmitted with an autosomal dominant character and characterized by hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system and retina, renal tumors and cysts, and pheochromocytoma. Pancreatic manifestations of VHL are reported in the literature with incidences ranging from 16 to 29% of cases and consist mainly in cystadenomas of the serous type and in multiple cystic lesions, often with complete replacement of the gland.We report five cases of VHL with a polycystic pancreas as the main or only manifestation, all devoid of symptoms related to involvement of the pancreas, who were referred to our Pancreatic Surgery center with diagnoses of multiple pancreatic pseudocysts of undefined origin.
