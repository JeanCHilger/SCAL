Pancreatic carcinoma associated with the Leser-Trélat sign. A case of pancreatic carcinoma associated with the Leser-Trélat sign is reported. A 53-yr-old male had complained of mild epigastric discomfort and back pain accompanied by seborrheic keratoses, which had increased in size and number over the previous 6 mo. A tumor was detected in the head of the pancreas and macroscopically curatively resected. His skin lesions diminished after surgery, but progressed again when the tumor recurred. Immunohistology for EGF showed a low level in the pancreatic carcinoma cells but a higher EGF content was recognized in the hyperkeratinized portions of the seborrheic keratoses. Of 130 underlying malignancies described in the 125 reported patients with the Leser-Trélat sign, neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract were most common, comprising 47.7% of the total. The present case is the third case showing an association between a pancreatic carcinoma and the Leser-Trélat sign, but the first case for which the tumor of the pancreas was diagnosed in an early stage and resected surgically, as a result of the suggestive nature of this sign.
