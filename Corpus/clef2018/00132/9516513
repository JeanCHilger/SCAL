Primary carcinoid tumor of the pancreas. Serotonin-secreting (carcinoid) tumors of the pancreas are very rare. There are only 13 cases reported since 1963. Liver metastases have not previously been described. We present two patients with primary carcinoid tumor of the pancreas, which metastasized to the liver. These patients differ in their clinical and radiological appearance. Carcinoid tumor should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a pancreatic mass in a patient with carcinoid syndrome, but lack of this syndrome does not exclude the diagnosis.
