Lymphoepithelial cyst of the pancreas. Report of a case diagnosed by fine needle aspiration biopsy. Lymphoepithelial cysts of the pancreas are very rare lesions. To the best of our knowledge, 24 cases are reported in the literature.A 64-year-old male presented with gastrointestinal complaints. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen disclosed a 55 x 30-mm, homogeneous mass anterior to and contiguous with the pancreas. Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) showed threads of tissue composed of stratified squamous epithelium with subepithelial lymphocytic infiltrate and keratinous material.This case illustrates that FNAB is a rapid and reliable technique that can be used as the first diagnostic step in cases of cystic lesions of the pancreas. To our knowledge, this is the third case reported of this entity diagnosed with FNAB.
