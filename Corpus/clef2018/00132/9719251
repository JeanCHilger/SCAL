Anomalous junction of the pancreaticobiliary duct accompanied by gallbladder cancer and obstructive jaundice in a patient with high serum and bile cytokine levels. We report a case of anomalous junction of the pancreaticobiliary duct (AJPBD) associated with gallbladder cancer and obstructive jaundice in a patient with high serum and bile cytokine levels. The patient was a 63-year-old woman who complained of right hypochondralgia. Ultrasound, computed tomography, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography, and endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatatography revealed dilation of the bile ducts, an elevated lesion of the gallbladder, and AJPBD. She underwent percutaneous transhepatic cholangio-drainage (PTCD) for obstructive jaundice. However, the total bilirubin concentration remained high 7 days after PTCD. Her serum interleukin 6 level was 57,359 pg/ml before PTCD, and gradually decreased to 10 pg/ml after PTCD. Bile interleukin 6 level was 10 pg/ml before PTCD, 8997 pg/ ml 3 h after PTCD and gradually decreased there after. Serum and bile levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha and hepatocyte growth factor were high before and after PTCD. The patient underwent an extended cholecystectomy and resection of the extrahepatic bile duct. The resected specimen showed two elevated lesions of the gallbladder which, microscopically, revealed moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma. These findings suggest that pre-existing inconspicuous inflammation of the biliary tract due to reflux of pancreatic juice is involved in elevation of serum and bile cytokines, and that cytokines may participate in gallbladder carcinogenesis associated with AJPBD.
