Primary primitive neuroectodermal tumour of the parotid gland. Primitive neuroectodermal tumour (PNET) is a malignant small round cell tumour that exhibits neuroepithelial differentiation. Isolated cases of PNET have been reported in visceral sites such as the kidney, uterus, ovary, testis, urinary bladder and pancreas. We present two cases of PNET of the parotid gland.The first case was a 60-year-old woman, who presented with a parotid swelling of 10 months duration. The second case was a 45-year-old man, who presented with a recurrent temporofacial swelling of 6 months duration. Histological evaluation, in conjunction with immunohistochemistry, confirmed the diagnosis of PNET.This is the first documentation of PNET of the salivary gland. The probable origin is from the facial nerve.
