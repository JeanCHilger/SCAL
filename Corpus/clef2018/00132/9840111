Penile metastasis secondary to cecum carcinoma: a case report. To date, only around 300 cases of metastasis to the penis have been reported and the primary cancer has been generally found in genitourinary structures. However, exceptional cases in which the primary site has been situated in organs like esophagus, pancreas, stomach have been published. We report an uncommon case in which the primary tumor was located in the cecum. To our knowledge, this is the first case of penile metastasis in which the responsible tumor was located in the cecum and in which the mode of metastasis was not direct invasion. As the tumor was restricted to the colon wall without invasion to neighbouring structures, and because colon cancer follows mainly the lymph-vascular route to its dissemination, this route is the most likely mode of the spread. By magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on penile shaft, multiple nodules were clearly visualized. Nevertheless, as in most cases, in spite of the availability of advanced and precise diagnostic methods, the information was of little value for the patient. His survival was short.
