Intraductal mucin-producing tumor of the pancreas: diagnosis by MR cholangiopancreatography. Our goal was to evaluate the usefulness of MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) for intraductal mucin-producing tumor of the pancreas (MPT).Eleven patients with intraductal MPTs (six main duct type five branch duct type) underwent MRCP. The findings of MRCP were compared with those of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).In all of the cases, MRCP could disclose all dilated pancreatic ducts and cysts, some of which were not demonstrated by ERCP. MRCP did not show a signal void of mucin in any of the cases. In the two cases of the main duct type, ERCP showed filling defects of excrescent nodules, which were not seen by MRCP. In the two cases of the main duct type, nodules were seen more clearly by ERCP than by MRCP.MRCP and ERCP are complementary imaging modalities for intraductal MPT.
