Laparoscopic ultrasound: a valuable adjunct to laparoscopic surgery. Laparoscopic ultrasound represents a recent merger in the laparoscopic technology and intraoperative ultrasound and shows a diagnostic accuracy higher than preoperative studies. Laparoscopic ultrasound can be used during laparoscopic cholecystectomy to screen the bile duct. It is particularly useful for diagnosing and staging malignancies, including hepatobiliary, pancreatic and gastroesophageal cancers. By demonstrating the interior of organs and deep structures, it can compensate for the limitation of laparoscopic examination. Laparoscopic ultrasound will become a valuable adjunct to laparoscopic surgery.
