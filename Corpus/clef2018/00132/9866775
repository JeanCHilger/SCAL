Solitary true cyst of the pancreas. We report a case of a woman diagnosed with a solitary true cyst of the pancreas. CT and especially MRI guided us in the diagnosis of this benign lesion. The cyst has been surgically removed because of secondary bile-duct obstruction causing painless jaundice. Clinical history, laboratory, imaging, and histological findings are reported.
