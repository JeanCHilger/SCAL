MR cholangiography: technical advances and clinical applications. Magnetic resonance (MR) cholangiography is a fast, accurate, noninvasive alternative to endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) in the evaluation of biliary tract disease. Technical improvements in imaging sequences (eg, half-Fourier rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement) and use of phased-array coils allow high-quality imaging comparable to that available with ERC. In choledocholithiasis, common bile duct stones as small as 2 mm can be detected with MR cholangiography and appear as low-signal-intensity foci within the high-signal-intensity bile. MR cholangiography may help establish the diagnosis of malignant obstruction and is useful in the evaluation of patients in whom ERC was unsuccessful or incomplete. The role of MR cholangiography in the evaluation of intrahepatic duct disease continues to evolve. MR cholangiography plays a crucial role in evaluating postsurgical biliary tract alterations and can be used to demonstrate a variety of congenital anomalies of the biliary tract (eg, aberrant ducts, choledochal cysts, pancreas divisum). In addition, intentional or incidental imaging of the gallbladder with MR cholangiography can be used to identify calculi or help determine the presence and extent of neoplastic disease.
