Pre-operative predictors of short-term survival after pancreatic cancer resection. The aim of the present study is to investigate the pre-operative factors that affect short-term survival after pancreatic cancer resection and to evaluate their prognostic value.Fifty-nine patients with ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas operated on in the Second Department of Surgery, Hokkaido University Hospital between 1989 and 1996 were reviewed.The patients had a mean age of 62.6 years. The difference of survival between patients aged 62 years or younger and older patients was significant (p=0.0053). Primary tumor size was evaluated with enhanced CT examination 36 patients had tumors larger than 3 cm in diameter. The 1-year survival rate of patients with tumors 3 cm or less in diameter was significantly better than that of patients with primary tumors greater than 3 cm in diameter (p=0.0258). Analysis of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) showed a significant difference in 1-year survival rates between patients with a pre-operative value below twice the diagnostic cutoff level (cutoff indexIt was suggested that age and serum CEA level were independent prognostic factors of short-term survival after pancreatic cancer resection.
