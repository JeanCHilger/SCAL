Benign retroperitoneal schwannoma mimicking a pancreatic cystic tumor: case report and literature review. A rare case of benign retroperitoneal schwannoma mimicking a pancreatic cystic tumor is reported herein. The tumor mass, based on a computed tomography scan and an abdominal echo examination, was initially suspected to be a mucinous cystadenoma or cystadenocarcinoma of the pancreas. However, the surgical and pathohistological findings made a final diagnosis of benign pancreatic schwannoma. The patient is doing well at a 2-year follow-up. The tumor, 18x17x15 cm in size, represented the largest among reported pancreatic schwannomas. Furthermore, a comprehensive review of reported cases of pancreatic schwannoma was carried out to summarize corresponding findings, including benign or malignant forms, adherence to other tissues, cystic change of the tumor, as well as relation to von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis.
