2D-FASE MRCP for pediatrics with congenital biliary dilatation: usefulness of non-breath-hold one-shot MRCP. The usefulness of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) using the non-breath-hold one-shot technique was evaluated. Ten children suffering from congenital biliary dilatation (CBD) were included. Four of them were preoperative cases, and the remaining six postoperative. All MR images taken were compared with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or intraoperative cholangiography. MR images using the non-breath-hold one-shot technique clearly showed the confluence of the common bile duct and the main pancreatic duct in seven of the cases. The confluence of the common bile duct and main pancreatic duct was obscure in the other three cases, mainly due to motion artifact. These results show that this non-breath-hold one-shot technique is useful for diagnosis and postoperative follow-up of congenital biliary dilatation in children.
