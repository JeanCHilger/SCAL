Efficacy of multidirection MRCP. Pancreatobiliary system has complex and thin structure except for gallbladder, thereby MRCP having lower spatial resolution gives sufficient information compared with the direct cholangiopancreatography. Multidirection MRCP using HASTE sequence obtains the data in plane to compensate the lower spatial resolution, thus high detectability of all over pancreatobiliary system is performed in a few minutes. This technique overcomes the demerits pointed by former investigators and gives sufficient information to diagnose the pancreatobiliary diseases.
