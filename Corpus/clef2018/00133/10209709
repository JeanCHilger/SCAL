Radiologic aspects of the complications of duodenal diverticula. The duodenum is the second most common site, after the colon, for intestinal diverticulae. This condition is most often asymptomatic and is usually an accidental finding. Complications, with variable clinical presentations, may occur in up to 5% of such individuals. We report a retrospective analysis of 5 patients who presented with complicated duodenal diverticular disease. The complications, either isolated or multiple, consisted of bezoar formation (n = 2), diverticulitis (n = 2), extrinsic compression of the common bile duct (n = 3), perforation (n = 1), choledocholithiasis (n = 1), and an abnormality of the bilio-pancreatic ductal convergence (n = 1). The radiological aspects, in particular, the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features are reviewed. These are, to our knowledge, the first descriptions of MRI and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatographic (MRCP) findings in complicated duodenal diverticular disease. MRI facilitates precise delineation of the complicated duodenal diverticulum while MRCP allows assessment of the effects on the biliary and pancreatic ducts.
