Frantz's tumour of the pancreas presenting as a post-traumatic pancreatic pseudocyst. A case of a solid, pseudopapillary and cystic tumour of the pancreas in a 13-year-old girl was presented. Shortly after a blunt abdominal trauma, an abdominal mass became manifest. Clinical features and radiological findings suggested a traumatic pseudocyst of the pancreas. Laparotomy and pathology revealed a Frantz's tumour, which was totally resected. Twelve months after surgery the patient is asymptomatic and CT-scan shows no signs of recurrence or metastasis. To our knowledge, no such acute presentation has ever been described in the literature since the first clinical report of this tumour in 1959.
