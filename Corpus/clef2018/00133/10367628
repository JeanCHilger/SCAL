Solid-pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas--a rare and frequently misdiagnosed neoplasm. We describe a young woman with an unusual pancreatic tumor.Intraoperatively, a smoothly demarcated and encapsulated tumor was exposed. It was large (5 cmx4 cm) and of solid consistency, with a small stalk attached to the uncinate process. The tumor was partially surrounded by the pancreatic head. The macroscopic appearance suggested a benign tumor. Frozen sections revealed a benign pancreatic tumor, most likely of endocrine nature. Based on these findings, tumor enucleation was performed. The patient recovered rapidly from the intervention and was discharged from hospital after 2 weeks. One year after surgical treatment, the patient is without recurrence. The final diagnosis of the tumor was a solid pseudo-papillary tumor.
