Efficacy of non-breath-hold magnetic resonance cholangiography at midfield strength. The efficacy of non-breath-hold magnetic resonance (MR) cholangiography at mid-field strength (0.5 Tesla) was evaluated for delineating biliary anatomy and the cause and extent of biliary obstruction. We performed 65 MR cholangiograms on a mid-field 0.5 Tesla MR unit and correlated them with contrast cholangiography and/or surgery. MR cholangiography was found to be both sensitive and specific in the detection of biliary obstruction and in the definition of its cause (sensitivity 98%, specificity 100%, positive predictive value 100%, negative predictive value 85.7%, accuracy 98%). MR cholangiography accurately predicted the level of obstruction in 94 per cent of strictures. Normal caliber intra-hepatic biliary radicles were visualised in only 6 per cent of the MR cholangiograms. In contrast, 94 per cent of dilated intrahepatic biliary radicles were demonstrated. The confluence, and right and left hepatic ducts were visualized in 98 per cent the gall bladder in 65 per cent
