Triple carcinomas of the biliary tract associated with congenital choledochal dilatation and pancreaticobiliary maljunction. We report a rare case of triple carcinomas of the biliary tract associated with congenital choledochal dilatation (CCD) and pancreaticobiliary maljunction (PBM). The patient was a 58-year-old Japanese man who complained of epigastralgia. Ultrasonography and computed tomography revealed an elevated lesion inside the markedly dilated extrahepatic bile duct, thickening of the gallbladder wall, and small polypoid lesions in the gallbladder. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography showed CCD and PBM. With a diagnosis of carcinoma of the bile duct and cholesterol polyps in the gallbladder, pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed. The resected specimen showed two elevated lesions in the dilated bile duct, cholesterol polyps, and an area of irregular mucosa in the gallbladder. Histopathological examination showed two carcinomas in the bile duct, an adenosquamous cell carcinoma, and a moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma, and a well differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder. Two years and 6 months after the operation, a solitary metastatic liver tumor was detected. Left hepatic lobectomy was performed. At present, 7 months after the second operation, the patient is doing well with no signs of recurrence. Multiple carcinomas in the biliary tract associated with CCD and PBM, including the details in the present patient, were reviewed.
