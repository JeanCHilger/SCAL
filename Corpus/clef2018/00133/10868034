MR cholangiopancreatography. MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a new technique allowing noninvasive investigation of the bile ducts and pancreatic duct. Due to the extremely intense signal of water on T2-weighting, MR sequences can be obtained only demonstrating liquids. The bile and pancreatic ducts can therefore be studied spontaneously even in the case of major cholestasis. The contraindications of MR cholangiography are exclusively those of MR. MRCP can visualize the level of a bile duct obstruction and often the nature of this obstruction (stone, tumour). Complementary axial T1- and T2-weighted sequences can also visualize the parenchyma around the ducts. MR cholangiography therefore appears to be a technique of the future for noninvasive investigation of the bile ducts.
