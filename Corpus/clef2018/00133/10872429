Pancreatic cancer surveillance in a high-risk cohort. Is it worth the cost? Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the 10th most common malignancy and 4th largest cancer killer in adults. Earlier tumor detection through screening of high risk groups, presumably to increase the percentage of cases resectable for cure in these cohorts, has emerged as a prominent strategy to combat this disease. This article examines the feasibility of this strategy in patients with hereditary pancreatic cancer (HPC) and hereditary pancreatitis (HP). Because of a variety of factors, specific cost projections for screening with HPC kindreds are problematic at best. Patients with HP exhibit a 53-fold increased risk of pancreatic cancer, with a cumulative risk of 40% by age 70. The authors discuss the modalities available to screen this cohort and subsequently perform a theoretical cost analysis. The authors' findings suggest that screening has the potential to be cost-effective only in hereditary pancreatitis patients = 50 years-of-age. The most cost-effective option will likely combine an initial serologic test with high sensitivity and a subsequent serologic or pancreatic juice test with sufficient specificity to act as a "gatekeeper" to imaging with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). Banking of blood and pancreatic juice samples should be mandatory in any screening protocol. The lower tumor yield in other high-risk groups (e.g., non-hereditary chronic pancreatitis) will effectively preclude the use of such screening protocols. The vast majority of patients will continue to present with unresectable disease.
