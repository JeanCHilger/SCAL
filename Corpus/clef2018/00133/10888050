Pancreatic pseudoaneurysm converted from pseudocyst: transcatheter embolization and serial CT assessment. We present a case of pancreatic pseudoaneurysm converted from a pseudocyst. Contrast-enhanced CT disclosed a round enhancing lesion at the previously identified pseudocyst, and angiography confirmed the diagnosis of a pseudoaneurysm. The pseudoaneurysm was successfully treated by arterial embolization. We believe arterial embolization to be the treatment of choice for pseudoaneurysm as a complication of pancreatitis.
