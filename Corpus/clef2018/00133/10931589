MRI with mangafodipir trisodium in the detection and staging of pancreatic cancer. The purpose of this study was to compare prospectively computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging before and after mangafodipir trisodium infusion for the detection and staging of focal pancreatic lesions. From November 1996 to October 1997, 43 consecutive patients suspected to have a focal pancreatic lesion were included in a phase III study. Triphasic helical CT was performed, as well as MRI at 1.5 T, as follows: axial T1-weighted (T1w) turbo spin echo (TSE), spectral presaturation with inversion recovery (SPIR) T1w TSE, T1w turbo field echo (TFE), and SPIR T2w TSE before and after mangafodipir trisodium (0.01 mmol/ml, 0.5 ml/kg) infusion. Imaging results were correlated with surgery, laparoscopy, laparoscopic ultrasound, and biopsy. Objective measurements were performed by measuring signal intensities (SIs) of lesion and parenchyma and calculating contrast indexes (CIs) and contrast-to-noise-ratios (CNRs) to assess the delineation of the tumor. SIs were correlated with four phantom standards with a known SI. Thirty-eight pancreatic adenocarcinomas were present, as well as one cystadenoma, two papillomas, and two cases of focal pancreatitis. SI measurements revealed significant increases in CIs for the lesion compared with the parenchyma in T1w TSE (69.7 vs 152.7 P = 0. 0003) and T1w TFE (107.8 vs 194.2
