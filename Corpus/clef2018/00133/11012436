Heterotopic pancreas in the stomach: CT findings. To describe the computed tomographic (CT) findings of heterotopic pancreas in the stomach.CT findings in 12 patients with heterotopic pancreas in the stomach were reviewed. Surgical resection (n = 11) or endoscopic excision (n = 1) was performed in cases of symptomatic heterotopic pancreas (n = 4), suspected submucosal tumors (n = 7), and gastric carcinoma (n = 1). Seven patients underwent helical CT with water as an oral contrast agent five underwent nonhelical CT with water-soluble contrast material.Nine heterotopic pancreata were in the antrum and one each was in the body, fundus, and perigastric fat. Seven lesions were on the greater curvature aspect five, on the lesser curvature aspect. Common CT findings were well-defined oval or round masses with smooth or serrated margins in the gastric antral wall. Four of the seven lesions in which helical CT was performed enhanced similarly to normal pancreas. Preoperatively, CT depicted 11 of the 12 lesions, but CT findings were interpreted correctly as heterotopic pancreas in only twoCT findings of heterotopic pancreas in the stomach appear to be nonspecific for diagnosis, except for location.
