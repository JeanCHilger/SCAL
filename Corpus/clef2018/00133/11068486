New diagnostic strategies in biliary-pancreatic diseases. The indication for ERCP have dramatically changed over the last few years, this technique becoming mainly therapeutic and loosing its indication as a diagnostic tool for imaging the biliopancreatic area. The two major less or non invasive techniques which have replaced ERCP in its diagnostic indications are the endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and the magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). The present paper reviews the current indications of these two techniques, as well as their impact on the practice of ERCP in 2000.
