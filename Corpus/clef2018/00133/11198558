Cystic fibrosis--initial diagnosis in a 39-year-old patient. Cystic fibrosis is the most common hereditary disorder among Caucasians. Most of the patients are diagnosed as children. However, some cases are going undiagnosed into adulthood and are then often misdiagnosed because the non-pediatricians do not know cystic fibrosis very well and do not consider this diagnosis in adult patients.We present the medical history of a woman, who was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis at the age of 39 years, although she had suffered from bronchiectasis, pancreatic insufficiency and liver cirrhosis since many years. Her medical history was long with some diagnosis, but because of her age nobody considered the final diagnosis.In adult patients with bronchiectasis, liver cirrhosis and pancreatic insufficiency in combination or with only one of these symptoms, cystic fibrosis should be included into the differential diagnosis.
