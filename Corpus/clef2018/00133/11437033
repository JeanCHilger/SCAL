Severe lower limbs lymphedema of late onset revealing polysplenia syndrome--a case report. Polysplenia syndrome includes a group of congenital abnormalities involving the spleen, gastrointestinal tract, liver, and cardiovascular system. A case of severe lower limbs lymphedema occurring in a young woman with polysplenia, azygous continuation of the inferior vena cava, short pancreas, and preduodenal portal vein is reported. Lower limb lymphedema could represent a new clinical manifestation associated with polysplenia syndrome. Lymphedema could be the result of a primary anomaly of the lymphatic system or be induced by high pressure in the venous system or by compression of the lymphatic circulation by the hypertrophic azygous vessels in the posterior mediastinum.
