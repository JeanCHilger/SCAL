Imaging features of pancreatoblastoma. Pancreatoblastoma is a rare tumour of childhood. Reports of the imaging appearances are limited.To define the imaging features of pancreatoblastoma by analysis of four previously unreported cases and review of the literature.Findings at CT (n = 4), US (n = 3) and MRI (n = 2) were retrospectively reviewed in four patients with pancreatoblastoma. A Medline search was performed to identify relevant literature.Pancreatoblastoma arises most frequently in the body and/or tail, or involves the entire pancreas. Ultrasonography, CT and MRI show variable imaging features, but should in most cases permit preoperative distinction of pancreatoblastoma from other tumours that occur in this region in infancy and childhood. Detection of metastases in the liver, lymph nodes and peritoneal cavity is not significantly better with any one of these three modalities.Preoperative imaging with US, CT and/or MRI will usually suggest a correct diagnosis of pancreatoblastoma. Contrary to previous reports, the tumour arises in the pancreatic head in a minority of cases.
