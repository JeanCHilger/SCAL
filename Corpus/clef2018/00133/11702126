Intraductal papillary mucinous tumors of the pancreas: spectrum of CT and MR findings with pathologic correlation. The reports of intraductal papillary mucinous tumors (IPMT) of the pancreas are increasingly more frequent in the literature. The diagnosis by means of cross-sectional imaging of these tumors is not easy, especially in the early stages, when they can mimic an inflammatory disease of the pancreas. Prompt identification of the disease is nevertheless extremely important, especially in the case of tumors originating from the collateral branches, since its recognition can modify the management of the patient, in some cases obviating recourse to surgery.
