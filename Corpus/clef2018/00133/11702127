Dynamic gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging of pancreatic VIPoma in a patient with Verner-Morrison syndrome. We describe a rare case of a pancreatic VIPoma diagnosed in a patient presenting with watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria, the so-called WDHA or Verner-Morrison syndrome. Emphasis is placed on the dynamic gadolinium-enhanced MR profile of the tumor, characteristics which have not been illustrated previously, to the best of our knowledge.
