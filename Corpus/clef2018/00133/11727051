Solid-cystic papillary tumor of the pancreas in children. Solid-cystic papillary tumor (SCPT) of the pancreas is a rare neoplasm in children. The current study attempted to estimate the incidence and possible pathological origin of the tumor. Clinicopathologic features of the children under the age of 16 years with pancreatic tumors managed in a single institution between January 1993 and November 1999 were reviewed. Representative blocks of SCPT specimens were immunostained for neuron-specific enolase (NSE) chromogrannin, synaptophysin, insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and gastrin. There were three SCPTs, two pancreatic endocrine tumors, and one acinar cell carcinoma during the study period. The estimated yearly incidence in the referral area of 2 million population is about 0.01 pediatric SCPT per year per 100,000 population. The children underwent surgical removal of the tumors. Postoperatively, they were followed up for 6 months to 4 years and were well. Immunostaining for NSE, chromogranin, synaptophysin, insulin, somatostatin, and gastrin was negative in all cases. SCPT may thus be the most common pancreatic tumor in the Asian pediatric population. The pathological origin of the tumor remains unclear and requires further investigations.
