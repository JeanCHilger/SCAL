A case of hepatic pseudoaneurysm treated with percutaneous embolization in a child with multiple trauma. Hepatic artery pseudoaneurysms are rare complications of blunt abdominal trauma in children. Diagnosis is frequently delayed and made by splanchnic angiography. Most of the indications for surgical treatment have disappeared after the development of selective catheterization and embolization. We report a case in an 8-year-old pedestrian who was struck by a car and suffered a multiple trauma with a severe blunt abdominal trauma. A severe collapse upon admission commanded immediate laparotomy that depicted a liver fracture with associated jejunal and pancreatic lesions. Recovery was progressive until the 15th postoperative day where an abrupt haemobilia occurred. A CT-scan exploration was performed and revealed a vascular mass lesion in the left lobe of the liver. The performance of a selective angiography confirmed the diagnosis of left artery pseudoaneurysm, but because of technical difficulties, no embolization could be performed by this way. A direct percutaneous puncture and embolization of the aneurysm allowed a complete exclusion of the lesion. Eventually, recovery was complete. This percutaneous technique could be a valuable alternative to classical embolization and could avoid surgical treatment that still carries a high morbidity.
