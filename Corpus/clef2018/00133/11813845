Pseudotumorous pancreatitis associated with ulcerative colitis. Pancreatitis is believed to be one of the uncommon extraintestinal manifestations of ulcerative colitis (UC). A 66-year-old woman who had been treated for UC for eight months was admitted to our hospital because of epigastralgia. Laboratory examinations revealed elevated pancreatic enzymes. Because differentiation of pseudotumorous pancreatitis from pancreatic cancer was difficult by the imaging findings, she underwent a distal pancreatectomy. Histologically, the tumorous lesion was composed of fibrosis with lymphocytic infiltration. We concluded that this case was pseudotumorous pancreatitis as an extraintestinal manifestation of UC.
