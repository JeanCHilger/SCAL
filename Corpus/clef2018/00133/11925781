High resolution spiral computed tomography of the pancreas. Computed tomography (CT) is a very useful tool in the assessment of pancreatic disease. Searching for subtle signs, as in chronic pancreatitis or staging of adenocarcinoma, high spatial and contrast resolution is needed. The high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) technique for pancreatic scans, and its evolution from dynamic CT to multislice spiral CT, is described. 2D and 3D dimensional reconstructions are depicted and their role in diagnosis is focused. Together with spatial resolution, contrast enhancement protocols are discussed, aimed to achieve optimal contrast between the lesion and normal parenchyma.
