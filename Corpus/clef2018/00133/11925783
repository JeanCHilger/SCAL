Magnetic resonance pancreatography (MRP): morphology and function. MRCP is able to non-invasively assess the pancreatic ducts, with moderate/high agreement with ERCP: There is however a high number of false negative results, mainly due to the small size of the main pancreatic duct, especially in the tail, and side branches. Secretin stimulates the exocrine pancreas with accumulation of fluid and bicarbonates in the ductal system, and subsequent enlargement. This increase in caliber improves the assessment of the morphology of pancreatic ducts and their abnormalities. MRCP accuracy in assessing ductal abnormalities, improves after secretin administration. Furthermore, dynamic MRCP during secretin administration is also able to afford the functional evaluation of the pancreatic flow dynamics. Papillary stenosis, either idiopathic or due to Santorinicele, is easily diagnosed by means of S-MRCP. Furthermore a noninvasive assessment of the pancreatic exocrine reserve can be performed with dynamic MRCP during secretin administration.
