Sonographic measurement of the volume of the left lateral segment of the liver. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of sonography for measuring the volume of the left lateral segment of the liver.The volume of the left lateral segment of the liver was measured with sonography in 101 consecutive patients who were hospitalized between December 1998 and January 2000 for hepatic, biliary, or pancreatic disease or who were donors for a living related liver transplantation. The results were compared with those obtained using CT.The mean calculated volume of the left lateral segment of the liver +/- standard deviation was 261 +/- 118 cm(3) by sonography compared with 274 +/- 123 cm(3) by CT. The relationship between the results of both imaging modalities was linear and statistically significant (r = 0.93 p < 0.0001).Our study demonstrated that sonography has an acceptable level of accuracy and reliability for routine measurement of the volume of the left lateral segment of the liver.
