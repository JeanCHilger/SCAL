Annular pancreas in adults: embryological development, morphology and clinical significance. Three cases (two male, one female) of annular pancreas are presented, which were found and operated on within the last three decades. Diagnosis was made using imaging techniques, especially ultrasonography and computed tomography. In two cases there was incomplete obstruction, while in the other obstruction was complete. It is characteristic that in the case of complete obstruction the annular portion of the pancreas attached to a circular band of connective tissue, while in the two cases of incomplete obstruction there was a complete ring of pancreatic tissue. In all cases surgical intervention was needed in order to create a bypass. In the first case gastroenterostomy and truncal vagotomy was performed, in the second latero-lateral duodeno-jejunostomy and in the third latero-lateral antropyloroduodeno-jejunostomy. The embryology and morphology of the annular pancreas, the morphology of its duct system, diagnosis, differential diagnosis and the surgical treatment of this rare condition are reviewed.
