Secretin stimulated magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography in diseases of the biliary and pancreatic ducts. MRCP has replaced ERCP as the diagnostic tool in diseases in the biliary and pancreatic ducts. Secretin increases the secretion to ducts, and this has been reported to improve MRCP image quality.We report our experience with S-MRCP in our first 20 patients. Secretin was given intravenously and images were obtained every minute for 10 minutes. These images were compared with MRCP images taken before and after secretin stimulation.New information was yielded in 18 cases, i.e. information not observed in previous radiological examinations.In diagnostics of dysfunction of the sphincter of Oddi, the method may be useful, given the functional aspect of the procedure where increased pressure in the ducts may lead to pain. It may further improve the diagnostics of pancreatic cancer versus pancreatitis, in pancreas divisum and sclerosing cholangitis. The method is also valuable for clarifying whether there is injury to the pancreatic duct after blunt abdominal trauma. Surgical common bile duct injuries may be better assessed than with any other method. In difficult pancreatic and biliary investigations, S-MRCP seems to be a useful and complication-free supplement to existing diagnostic methods.
