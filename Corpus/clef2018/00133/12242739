Solitary metastasis from renal cell carcinoma presenting as diffuse pancreatic enlargement. Late metastasis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) to the pancreas is uncommon. Diffuse pancreatic metastasis of any carcinoma rarely causes global enlargement of the pancreas. We present the case of a 73-year-old man diagnosed with metastatic RCC of the pancreas 9 years after radical nephrectomy had been performed and describe our radiologic findings. The disease involved the entire pancreas, which was hypoechoic on sonography, hypodense on CT without contrast enhancement, and markedly hyperdense after intravenous administration of a contrast agent. Color Doppler sonography showed that the involved areas of the pancreas had increased color flow signals, indicating that the metastatic tumor was characteristically hypervascular. In patients with a history of RCC, color or power Doppler sonographic demonstration of diffuse enlargement of the pancreas with evidence of hypervascularity may indicate metastasis of RCC to the pancreas.
