Pancreatic tuberculosis: still a histopathological diagnosis. Pancreatic tuberculosis is usually unsuspected as it can present in various forms. Though an uncommon disease, once diagnosed it is potentially curable.Retrospective review of the records of 9 patients with histologically proven tuberculosis of the pancreas.In none of the 9 patients was a preoperative diagnosis of tuberculosis possible. The diagnoses considered included: pancreatic cancer (n = 5) acute pseudocyst (n = 1)In view of the nonspecific and variable clinical presentation and atypical radiological signs, a clinical diagnosis of pancreatic tuberculosis is usually not possible. Therefore there should be a high index of suspicion for this disease in young patients residing in endemic areas. Our experience highlights the importance of performing biopsy in apparently inoperable pancreatic mass lesions.
