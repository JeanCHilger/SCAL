Clinical surveillance of patients with chronic recurrent pancreatitis. Clinical surveillance of patients affected by chronic relapsing pancreatitis is not a particularly difficult task. In fact, a number of precise landmarks is available such as recurrence of pain and nutritional conditions, possibly enriched by biochemical (specially serum pancreatic enzymes) and imaging data (US, CT, MR), which also may be periodically scheduled. Despite the opinion of some experts, the best timing for the periodical checks should probably be decided on an individual basis. A suitable surveillance program may also be useful to favour the patient compliance and to implement any therapeutic measures.
