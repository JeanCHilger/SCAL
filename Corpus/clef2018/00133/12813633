How much diagnostics in patients with pancreatic cancer?. The possibilities which actually exist in order to obtain an earlier diagnosis in pancreatic carcinoma, a better differentiation of mass-forming pancreatitis and of other pancreatic tumors and an improved staging for reducing unnecessary operations are presented and evaluated. Possible relevant hints of the history and indicators for diagnostic procedures in view of a pancreatic carcinoma are upper abdominal complaints especially in relation to a new developed diabetes mellitus and/or unexplained elevations of pancreatic enzymes. The endosonography in combination with a target biopsy is of important value as well for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer as for differentiation against a segmental chronic pancreatitis. In cases where differentiation is impossible even intraoperatively, we recommend the use of intraoperative fine needle biopsy.
