Mangan-enhanced MR imaging for the detection and localisation of small pancreatic insulinoma. Insulinoma is the most common pancreatic endocrine tumor. Localization of small tumors remains a diagnostic challenge. Recently, Mangafodipir-enhanced MR imaging using a whole-body coil has been shown to be effective in the detection and staging of pancreatic cancer [3]. Localization of even small tumors is improved and surgical techniques, such as robotic-assisted surgery, have been made possible.
