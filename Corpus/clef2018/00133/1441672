The value of ultrasound and computerized tomography in detection of cystic changes in chronic pancreatitis. Intra- or extrapancreatic pseudocysts (PP) are the most common local complication in chronic pancreatitis. Aim of this study was to investigate frequency, localisation and size of pseudocysts in patients with chronic pancreatitis by means of ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT). 155 patients (females 35, males 120) with chronic pancreatitis, that underwent simultaneous (within two weeks) CT and US examinations, from January 1982 to June 1989, were included in this study. Cystic lesions were detected in 62% by CT, in 52% by US. Sensitivity in detection of cysts based on intraoperative findings (gold standard) was 98% for CT and 94% for US. 80% of the pseudocysts were smaller than 6 cm. 46% were in the range from 2 to 66 cm and 34% were smaller than 2 cm. The most common localisation was the pancreatic head region (50%), 20 of 102 patients with chronic pancreatitis were found to have a direct communication of a pseudocyst with the ductal system by ERP. No specific clinical or laboratory pattern were associated with the presence of pseudocysts. Increased pancreatic serum amylase concentration was detected in 29% of patients with and in 27% of patients without pseudocysts.
