Intraductal papillary mucinous tumors and mucinous cystic tumors of the pancreas: imaging. Most cystic lesions of the pancreas are nonneoplastic and inflammatory in nature. However, approximately 5%-15% of cystic pancreatic masses may be neoplastic. Among the cystic neoplasms are the mucin-producing tumors, both the intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and the mucinous cystic neoplasms. Their imaging features on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can assist in the differentiation of these lesions. The imaging findings of both intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm and mucinous cystic neoplasm are reviewed with attention to CT and MRI.
