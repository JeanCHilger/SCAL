Staging of abdominal metastases in pancreatic carcinoma by diagnostic laparoscopy and magnetic resonance imaging. Different noninvasive and invasive techniques are available for the detection of abdominal metastases in pancreatic carcinoma. Since small hepatic or peritoneal metastases are a crucial problem which precludes resection, accurate detection is mandatory. We compared laparoscopic staging of abdominal metastases in adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with MRI.55 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma had been screened and 49 entered the retrospective study. All patients had undergone MRI of the upper abdomen with concomitant MR-cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and diagnostic laparoscopy under conscious sedation. Patients without histologic proof of abdominal metastases underwent laparotomy.In 6/10 patients, metastases were correctly detected by laparoscopy, yielding a sensitivity of 60% and a specificity of 92%.MRI predicted metastases in 6/10 patients with 60% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Laparoscopy showed metastases in 3 patients that were missed by MRI, but failed to identify metastases in 3 of 6 patients with metastases on MRI. Though only one patient showed previously undetected metastases during laparotomy, 3 patients with abdominal metastases underwent unnecessary laparotomy due to a lack of histologic proof of malignancy.Whereas diagnostic laparoscopy is sensitive for the detection of small metastases and offers histologic verification, intrahepatic alterations are not detectable by sole visual inspection.MRI may compensate for this deficiency, but histologic proof of malignancy may be problematic. To date, no definite decision in favor of one of the presented procedures for the staging of abdominal metastases can be given.
