Role of current MRI technology in the diagnosis of pancreatic tumors. The Magnetom Vision unit (Siemens) with 1.5 T magnetic field and a Body surface coil was used to examine 87 patients with pancreatic tumors, adenocarcinoma--56, cystadenoma--3, and chronic pancreatitis--28. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (87), dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (56) and MR angiography of the abdominal cavity (21) were used in conjunction with the paramagnetic drugs Magnevist (Shearing) or Omniscan (Nikomed). All necessary data for diagnosis and planning of surgical treatment of pancreatic tumors were obtained during a single examination due to complex use of present-day MRI techniques.
