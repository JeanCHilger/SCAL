Lymphocele mimicking a pancreatic pseudocyst: imaging characteristics and percutaneous management. Lymphocele can be a difficult diagnosis to establish and may be confused for other abdominal fluid collections. Conversely, pancreatic pseudocysts may occur inadvertently from upper abdominal surgery and must be included in the differential diagnosis of virtually all peripancreatic fluid collections. We report the unusual occurrence of an unsuspected postoperative peripancreatic lymphocele that was thought to be a pancreatic pseudocyst. In retrospect, CT findings were evident and diagnostic. The lymphocele responded well to percutaneous drainage.
