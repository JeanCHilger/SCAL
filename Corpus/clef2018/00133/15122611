Use of the time-signal intensity curve from dynamic magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate remnant pancreatic fibrosis after pancreaticojejunostomy in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. This study assessed the value of the time-signal intensity curve (TIC) obtained from dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the evaluation of remnant pancreatic fibrosis after pancreaticojejunostomy in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy.Two modes of pancreaticojejunostomy-duct-to-mucosa anastomosis (DMA 24 patients) and pancreatojejunoserosal anastomosis (PJSAEvaluation of preoperative dynamic magnetic resonance images showed that a pancreatic TIC with a rapid rise to a peak followed by a rapid decline (type I) was characteristic of a normal pancreas without fibrosis. Pancreatic TICs with a slow rise to a peak followed by a slow decline or a plateau (types II and III) indicated a fibrotic pancreas. Postoperative pancreatic MRI demonstrated that six of 12 patients with a PJSA had a type II TIC, whereas 12 of 14 patients with a DMA had a type I curve (P = 0.046).The TIC obtained from dynamic MRI is a reliable indicator of fibrosis in the remnant pancreas after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Use of a DMA was associated with a lower risk of pancreatic fibrosis 1-3 years after surgery than a PJSA.
