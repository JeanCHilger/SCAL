Difficult diagnosis of a biliary cyst. A case report. A 26 year-old man presented a hepatic cyst complicated by intracystic bleeding. Clinical and biological features (chronic pancreatitis), ultrasound and computed tomography findings apparent hepatic and splenic location), macroscopic aspects (inflammatory changes, brown-colored fluid) as well as microscopic characteristics (thickened cyst-wall, absence of epithelium) of both cysts suggested the diagnosis of pancreatic pseudocysts. The diagnosis of hepatic cyst was carried out on histological examination showing Meyenburg and neuro-fibrillar complexes. Occurrence of complications (bleeding, size enlargement) may modify typical histological aspect of hepatic cyst.
