Arteriovenous malformation of the pancreas in a patient with gastrointestinal bleeding: helical CT findings. Dynamic computed tomographic (CT) findings of arteriovenous malformation (AVM) of the pancreas include strong enhancement or conglomeration of small hypervascular spots in the pancreas and early contrast filling of the portal vein during the arterial phase. We describe a case with pancreatic AVM in which we identified enlarged arterial feeders and draining veins as supportive findings of the diagnosis and ulceration into the pancreatic duct as a possible cause of gastrointestinal bleeding at contrast-enhanced CT.
