Value and results of computer tomography in diseases of the pancreas (author's transl). In a joint study carried out by the radiological university clinics of Bonn, Hamburg, Cologne, Leuven and Munich, 483 computer tomographs of the pancreas were evaluated. A correct histological diagnosis, or one confirmed at surgery, was obtained in 74.5% of 168 cases in a further 9% an abnormality was seen in the pancreas or in its immediate vicinity, but was wrongly interpreted. The computer tomographic criteria of inflammatory processes and of tumours of the pancreas are given, and the not uncommon difficulties in distinguishing between these are discussed.
