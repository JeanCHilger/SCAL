Anaplastic pancreatic carcinoma. A case report and review of literature . Anaplastic pancreatic carcinoma is an aggressive neoplasm with survival measurable in weeks. It presents as a large cystic mass with loco-regional and distant spread. Three histological types have been described: pleomorphic, spindle cell and sarcomatoid.We describe the case of a 74-year-old woman with pleomorphic anaplastic carcinoma of the pancreas diagnosed after laparoscopic biopsy. The patient had a rapid downhill course with progression of the disease and demise within 4 weeks after diagnostic laparoscopy.Due to the rapid spread of the disease, no effective cure exists for these tumors. A brief review of the histological and radiological findings and the possible mechanisms of the pathogenesis of anaplastic tumors is included in the discussion.
