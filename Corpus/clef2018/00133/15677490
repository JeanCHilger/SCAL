A reduced-fat diet and aerobic exercise in Japanese Americans with impaired glucose tolerance decreases intra-abdominal fat and improves insulin sensitivity but not beta-cell function. Lifestyle modification reduces the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and may have its effect through improving insulin sensitivity, beta-cell function, or both. To determine whether diet and exercise improve insulin sensitivity and/or beta-cell function and to evaluate these effects over time, we quantified insulin sensitivity and the acute insulin response to glucose (AIRg) in 62 Japanese Americans (age 56.5 +/- 1.3 years mean +/- SE) with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) who were randomized to the American Heart Association (AHA) Step 2 diet plus endurance exercise (n = 30) versus the AHA Step 1 diet plus stretching (n = 32) for 24 months. beta-Cell function (disposition index [DI]) was calculated as S(i) x AIRg, where S(i) is the insulin sensitivity index. The incremental area under the curve for glucose (incAUCg) was calculated from a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. Intra-abdominal fat (IAF) and subcutaneous fat (SCF) areas were measured by computed tomography. At 24 months, the Step 2/endurance group had lower weight (63.1 +/- 2.4 vs. 71.3 +/- 2.9 kg
