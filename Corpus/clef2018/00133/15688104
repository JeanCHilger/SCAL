Pancreatic carcinoid tumor with obstructive pancreatitis: multislice helical CT appearance: case report. Carcinoid tumor of the pancreas is rare. Moreover, obstructive pancreatitis secondary to a pancreatic carcinoid tumor is extremely rare. We report a case of pancreatic carcinoid tumor in a 50-year-old male who presented with pancreatitis. On multislice helical computed tomography, the main pancreatic duct was obstructed by a small round tumor, and the main pancreatic duct proximal to the tumor was dilated. The correlation between the main pancreatic duct and the tumor was well depicted on minimum intensity projection image. This is the first report of multislice helical computed tomorgraphic and minimum intensity projection image findings of a pancreatic carcinoid tumor presenting with pancreatitis.
