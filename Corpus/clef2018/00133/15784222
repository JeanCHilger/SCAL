Rupture of a pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysm with median arcuate ligament syndrome: report of a case. Aneurysms of pancreaticoduodenal arteries represent only 2% of all aneurysms of digestive arteries. Occurrence of these aneurysms are favoured by stenosis or occlusion of the celiac axis. Aneurysm rupture is frequent and carries a mortality rate of 20%. Computed tomography with intravenous contrast and selective coeliomesenteric arteriography can make the diagnosis of this disease which can be treated by either surgery or embolotherapy. We report the case of a patient with a ruptured aneurysm of the pancreaticoduodenal arcades mimicking a perforated duodenal ulcer, and successfully treated by surgical ligation.
