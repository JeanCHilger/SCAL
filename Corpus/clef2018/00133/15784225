Traumatic pancreatic injuries. If an emergency laparotomy is necessary, a damage control laparotomy may be useful. If during the laparotomy the hemodynamic is stabilised, the severity is depending on the existence of a ductal injury and an associated duodenal lesion. Surgical indications and techniques are described in these different cases. If no laparotomy, the location and type of injury is assessed by CT scan, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography or ERCP. Injury of the pancreatic duct is the main part of prognosis and indications. The non operative treatment in case of ductal injury remains controversial.
