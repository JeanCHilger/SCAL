Accuracy of preoperative imaging methods in a retrospective series of 14 patients with operated intraductal papillary mucinous tumors of the pancreas. Accuracy of preoperative imaging methods for the diagnosis of intraductal papillary mucinous tumor of the pancreas (IPMT) is not well known.To compare diagnostic accuracy of various preoperative imaging methods with pathology data following surgical resection.Fourteen consecutive patients underwent pancreatic surgical resection for IPMT between January 1988 and May 2002. Imaging methods included endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and/or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and/or endoscopic ultrasonography. Results of preoperative morphological examinations were compared with histopathological findings from surgical specimens.IPMT was located to the pancreatic head or body in 72% of patients and involved the main pancreatic duct (MPD) in 79% of cases Carcinoma was diagnosed in 35% of the cases. Sensitivity of imaging methods varied from 64 to 80% to accurately locate the tumor and from 73 to 80% in distinguishing between types involving the MPD or the accessory ducts. Planned surgical resection based on preoperative imagery correlated with final surgery in 57% of the patients. Histological study of whole pancreas specimens revealed lesions in undilated ducts, and also dilated ducts without histological lesions.The sensitivity of preoperative imaging methods is moderate in defining intraductal extension of IPMT. Duct dilatation is not predictive of histological involvement by tumors and ducts may be pathological without dilatation.
