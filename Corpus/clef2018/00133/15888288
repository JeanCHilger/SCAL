Autoimmune pancreatitis. Autoimmune pancreatitis is a type of idiopathic pancreatitis. It is also referred to as sclerosing pancreatitis, lymphoplasmatocytic sclerosing pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis with irregular stenosis of the main pancreatic duct and as sclerosing pancreatocholangitis. Clinical characteristics of autoimmune pancreatitis are jaundice, abdominal pain, weight loss and diabetes mellitus. Radiologically, there is diffuse enlargement of pancreas with stenosis of pancreatic duct without calcifications in the pancreatic parenchyma. In autoimmune pancreatitis, antibodies against lactoferrin and carbonic anhydrase have been detected, but they are not specific because they are present in some other autoimmune diseases too. Also in autoimmune pancreatitis, there are increased levels of gammaglobulins and characteristically high titres of IgG4, which are a subtype of IgG. Autoimmune pancreatitis is usually treated successfully by prednisolone.
