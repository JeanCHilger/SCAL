Two cases of mature mediastinal teratoma complaining of sudden chest pain. We report two cases of mature mediastinal teratoma complaining of sudden chest pain. Both cases had cystic lesions, multilocular and unilocular, and pleural effusion. One case had fat density by CT and MRI and calcification was not recognized in either case. Surgical resection of the tumor revealed pancreatic tissue in both cases, suggesting that pancreatic enzymes might have led to the rupture of the tumor. The diagnosis of teratoma and its rupture should be considered in the cases of cystic lesion in mediastinal with sudden onset of chest pain.
