Intraductal serrated adenoma of the pancreas. A case report. A 48-year-old male with known hypothyreosis consulted his physician for symptoms compatible with TIA (transient ischemic attacks). Computer tomography (CT) in December 2001 revealed an irregular, lobulated mass in the processus uncinatus of the pancreas head. A CT examination 14 months later revealed status quo. In July 2004, a new CT showed an increase in size of the expansive pancreatic mass. The patient was operated on in August 2004 with a preliminary diagnosis of incidentaloma of the pancreas. The pathological examination showed a 4 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm large tumour. Histology revealed an intraductal serrated adenoma. The epithelial fronds had sawtooth-like configurations. An area with early invasive carcinoma was found. The tumour had progressed slowly during the 2.7 years of surveillance. Serrated neoplasia in the duodenum may result in similar cases in the future.
