Evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of the endoscopic ultrasonography results in the patients examined in a period of three years. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is a well-established method of evaluating patients with gastrointestinal diseases, especially malignancies. EUS is like other similar endoscopy techniques, based on high frequency ultrasonography. This high level technology allows examination of tissue to almost microscopic level, not only in digestive system but its surrounding structures.The aim of this study was to determine the contribution of endoscopic experience, based on the number of endosopic ultrasonography examination performed in the three years period, to obtain 80% diagnostic accuracy with staging of the disease in order to achieve a 30-60% change rate in treatment decisions which is accepted standard.First group with 210 patients was examined in the first year of work 325 examined in the second year of work and 295 in the third year.Accuracy in the first year of work, were 45% (p<0.001 for the choledocholithiasis p=0.197 for the pancreatic cancerApplication of Endoscopic ultrasonography in diagnostics, based on number of EUS examination performed, after three years of work, achieved 80% diagnostic accuracy, compared to standard imaging methods and results of surgery in staging of the disease. EUS results made a change in treatment decisions in 30-60% of patients which is world standard and completely justify use of endoscopic ultrasonography in clinical practice.
