Comparison of CT duodeno-cholangiopancreatography to ERCP for assessing biliary obstruction. The authors have developed a CT protocol, CT duodeno-cholangiopancreatography (CDCP), which is performed during a single contrast-enhanced phase, proceeding cranially, allowing enhancement of the pancreas during its parenchymal phase followed by enhancement of the liver during its portal-venous phase. This retrospective pilot study evaluates CDCP compared with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) as a diagnostic tool for assessing the cause and level of biliary obstruction. Forty-one patients with jaundice underwent CDCP and ERCP between October 2002 and May 2004. Pathologic confirmation was obtained in 31 of the 41 (76%) patients. The sensitivity, specificity, and kappa values of CDCP and ERCP compared with pathology were calculated for tumors and stones. Pathology-proven cases included 7 cases of stones, 23 tumors, and 1 other cause of obstruction. The overall level of agreement of diagnoses between CDCP and pathology was 29 of 31 (93.5%) that between CDCP and ERCP was 36 of 41 (88%). Comparing CDCP to pathology for tumors, the sensitivity was 100%, the specificity was 89%, and the kappa was 0.92 (95% CI 0.76-1.0). For stone detection, CDCP had a sensitivity of 86%, a specificity of 100%, and a kappa value of 0.90 (95% CI 0.72-1.0). For level of obstruction of the common bile duct, comparing CDCP to ERCP, observations agreed in 31 of the 36 (86%) cases
