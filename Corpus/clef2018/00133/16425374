Unicentric Castleman's disease of the pancreas with massive central calcification. Unicentric Castleman's disease of the pancreas is extremely rare, with only six cases described in the worldwide literature. An asymptomatic case of unicentric, hyaline, vascular-type Castlemanos disease (UCD) localized to the tail of the pancreas with central calcification imitating a primary neoplasm of the pancreas is presented. This is the first description of endosonographic and endoscopic retrograde pancreatographic findings of pancreatic UCD. Additionally, computed tomography, histological and serologic findings are reported.
