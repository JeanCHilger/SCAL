Fentanyl-augmented MRCP. Drugs such as secretin and morphine have been used to augment the visualization of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). This study investigated the effectiveness of intravenous administration of a synthetic opioid, fentanyl, in improving the MRCP image quality.Thirty consecutive patients with a provisional diagnosis of benign biliary and/or pancreatic disease underwent MRCP. Coronal single-shot fast spin-echo heavily T2-weighted dynamic MRCP images were generated before and at every minute for 10 min after intravenous administration of fentanyl citrate at a dose of 1.0 mug/kg. Pre- and postinjection images were compared and analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively.Qualitatively, visualization of intrahepatic bile ducts, common bile duct, and main pancreatic duct improved after fentanyl injection in five (16%), 11 (37%), and 19 (63%) patients, respectively. The pancreatobiliary junction and common channel were visualized better after fentanyl injection in eight of the 18 patients (44%). Quantitatively, signal intensity and diameters of the intrahepatic ducts, common bile duct, and main pancreatic duct measured at corresponding points on pre- and postinjection images showed an increase above preinjection values in 28 (93%), 27 (90%), and 21 (70%) and in 18 (60%), 26 (86%), and 22 (73%), respectively, and these changes were highly significant at all sites (p < 0.001).Intravenous administration of fentanyl before MRCP improves qualitative and quantitative visualization of the ductal system anatomy that may be of value in clinical diagnosis and management.
