A case of retroperitoneal dedifferentiated liposarcoma initially diagnosed as malignant fibrous histiocytoma: a case report. We report a case of retroperitoneal tumor which turned out to be liposarcoma by the histological evaluation of its recurrent tumor, although the initial tumor was diagnosed as malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH). A retroperitoneal tumor in a 62-year-old man was removed and pathologically diagnosed as MFH. Five years after the initial surgery, computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a recurrent tumor near the spleen. The tumor was resected together with the spleen, tail of pancreas, and connective tissue due to adhesion and diagnosed as well-differentiated liposarcoma with sclerosing component. Generally dedifferentiated liposarcoma is difficult to distinguish from MFH and the presence of a well-differentiated liposarcoma component in the adjacent adipose tissue leads to the diagnosis of dedifferentiated liposarcoma. The clinical course of the present case indicated that the initial tumor was dedifferentiated liposarcoma and the recurrent tumor developed from the surrounding well-differentiated liposarcoma.
