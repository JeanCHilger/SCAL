Carcinoid tumor of the papilla of Vater. Carcinoid tumor of the papilla of Vater is extreme rare. Only 73 cases have been reported in the world literature to date and only 1 case in Hungary. This tumor differs clinically and has a different prognosis from other carcinoid tumors of the gastrointestinal tract as it is more aggressive. The clinical feature is determined by the expansion and infiltrative nature of the tumor. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and endoscopic biopsy (EB) are the most accurate methods of diagnosis, while endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is the most important method to decide the surgical strategy. Depending on the tumor size and the grade of invasion of other structures surgical treatment can be local excision or radical resection. We present a 67-year-old female patient with obstructive jaundice, caused by carcinoid tumor of the papilla of Vater. Diagnosis was obtained by ERCP and EB. Because of the signs of local invasion emerging on EUS a pylorus preserving pancreatoduodenectomy was performed. Six months after the operation there is no evidence of recurrence.
