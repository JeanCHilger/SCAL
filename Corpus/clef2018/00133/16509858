Interventional applications of endoscopic ultrasound. Endoscopic ultrasound, which was developed more than 20 years ago, is currently a valuable investigative tool for endoscopists. It began as a diagnostic instrument and in the short span of a decade made a clinical impact as a therapeutic tool with a promising potential for various interventional applications. The introduction of the curved linear array echoendoscope in the 1990s enabled a whole range of interventional applications of endoscopic ultrasound ranging from fine needle aspiration of lesions surrounding the gastrointestinal tract to celiac plexus block and drainage of pancreatic pseudocyst. This review article outlines the current interventional applications of endoscopic ultrasound and discusses potential future procedures. These procedures include endoscopic ultrasound guided creation of communication between the gastrointestinal tract and adjacent organs, such as hepaticogastrostomy and choledochoduodenostomy.
