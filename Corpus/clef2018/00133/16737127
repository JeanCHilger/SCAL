Imaging methods in the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis. According to the document "Indication criteria for imaging methods" of 2000 approved by the European commission and experts representing European radiology and nuclear medicine in collaboration with the British UK Royal College of Radiologists in patients with chronic pancreatitis a simple picture of the abdomen is indicated in particular for detection of classifications. Other imaging methods include ultrasound examination (no radiation load) which in slim patients can lead to a final conclusion, or CT examination (great radiation load) suitable also for obese patients and the method is particularly effective for the detection of calcifications. ERCP and MRCP (visualization of the pancreatic duct and biliary pathways by magnetic resonance) are specialized methods. By means of ERCP it is possible to evaluate the morphology of the pancreatic duct but the procedure is associated with a high risk of development of acute pancreatitis. Therefore the importance of MRCP is increasing. The submited material are only recomendations, however, common practice in the Czech Republic is very close to the recommended procedure. The objective of the paper is to evaluate the importance and asset of different imaging methods for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis.
