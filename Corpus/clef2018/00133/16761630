Malignant glucagonoma. New options of treatment. Few cases of malignant glucagonomas have been described in the literature. In this paper we present a case of a 77-year-old woman with necrolytic migratory erythema and high plasma glucagon and chromogranin A levels caused by a neuroendocrine tumour. An abdominal CT scan suggested a pancreatic lesion and two liver metastases. The patient underwent pancreatic debulking and liver metastasectomy. Histological and immunohistochemical investigations revealed a well differentiated neuroendocrine tumour with vascular invasion and scattered immunopositivity for somatostatin receptors. The patient was treated with octreotide (20 mg i.m. every 28 days) for three years without side effects. Three months after surgery symptoms of disease recurred accompanied by hyperglucagonaemia and newly diagnosed liver lesions. The patient was treated with octreotide (30 mg i.m. every 28 days) and interferon-alpha (6 MU s.cc 3 times per week) plus three cycles of hepatic chemoembolisation. Symptoms resolved after the first month of therapy, hormone levels decreased compared to untreated levels and metastatic growth slowed as observed by radiographic evidence. The patient is now asymptomatic with persistent hepatic disease and normal serum glucagon levels forty months after primary treatment. So far, only few immunohistochemical studies are reported on malignant glucagonoma and combined treatment schedules. We demonstrated, for the first time, a scattered immunopositivity for somatostatin receptors in a malignant glucagonoma. For this reason, the somatostatin analogs therapy was instituted. A combined antiproliferative medical treatment and the hepatic chemoembolization have been able to control tumor growth and disease symptoms for a long time after surgery.
