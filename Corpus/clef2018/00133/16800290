A case of autoimmune pancreatitis complicated with immune thrombocytopenia. A 80-year old man was referred to our hospital because of an elevation of serum amylase level. Diffuse enlargement of the pancreas was detected by abdominal computed tomography, and also diffuse narrowing of the main pancreatic duct was revealed using endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. The serum level of IgG was elevated to 3450mg/dl. Besides, on the 10th hospital day, petechia developed and the platelet level decreased to 1.5 x 10(4)/microl. The platelet-associated IgG, antiplatelet antibody and antinuclear antibody in serum were positive. The levels of serum complements were low. From all these findings the patient was diagnosed as autoimmune pancreatitis complicated with immune thrombocytopenia. The treatment with prednisolone was started, which was effective on each disease. The medication was suspended a year ago, and so far there is no data suggesting the recurrence of autoimmune pancreatitis or immune thrombocytopenia.
