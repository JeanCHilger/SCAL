A case of advanced gastric cancer treated by TS-1 for 3 years and 7 months. A 72-year-old man was diagnosed as gastric cancer with pyloric stenosis by an upper gastorintestinal endoscopy for anemia in July 2001. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed multiple liver metastases. Serum CEA was 6.2 ng/ml. At laparotomy to improve anemia and pyloric stenosis in September 2001, lymphnode metastases invaded the stomach and the pancreatic body. Gastro-jejunostomy was performed without gastrectomy. Oral administration of 100 mg of TS-1 for 28 consecutive days followed by a 14-day rest was given postoperatively. The response assessment of chemotherapy after 1 year was no change (NC) of the primary lesion on endoscopic examination, and liver metastases showed a partial response (PR) on CT. Serum CEA was raised to 86.1 ng/ml in April 2004. The treatment was changed to weekly paclitaxel. The patient died in July 2005. This case with unresectable gastric cancer had been treated by oral administration of TS-1 as an outpatient for 3 years and 7 months.
