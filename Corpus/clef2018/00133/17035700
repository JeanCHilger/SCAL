Ectopic pancreas in the ampulla of vater with obstructive jaundice. A case report and review of literature. Ectopic pancreas is an uncommon condition and is usually found in the gastrointestinal tract, such as stomach, duodenum and jejunum. However, ectopic pancreas in the ampulla of Vater is rare and its clinical presentations may be similar to periampullary cancer. It is difficult to diagnose preoperatively. We present such a case where the diagnosis was proven postoperatively. Our patient, a 51-year-old man, presented with epigastric pain, jaundice, weight loss and abnormal laboratory data. Imaging study, including abdominal sonography, abdominal computerized tomography with contrast and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, showed a mass protruding into the ampulla of Vater. The mass was resected and histological examination revealed an ectopic pancreas. The patient presented with symptoms of periampullary tumor but the imaging study did not reveal an obvious lesion for us consider the possibility of ectopic pancreas. Surgical excision is indicated for symptomatic cases.
