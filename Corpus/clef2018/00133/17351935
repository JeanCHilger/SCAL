Solid-pseudopapillary tumor: a report of three cases in adult males diagnosed utilizing three different modalities. Solid-pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas is a rare neoplasm of uncertain origin with low malignant potential and often indolent behavior occurring predominantly in adolescent and young women. Here we report the cases of three adult males with pancreatic masses, one with metastasis, diagnosed as solid-pseudopapillary tumor by cytology, electron microscopy (EM), and routine histology. This neoplasm is uncommon in both males and adults and uncommonly metastasizes. The cases reported emphasize the utility of different diagnostic modalities, and here we review the diagnostic features by cytology, EM, and routine histology to correctly characterize this neoplasm. It is extremely important to correctly diagnose this indolent neoplasm due to the excellent prognosis with surgical resection.
