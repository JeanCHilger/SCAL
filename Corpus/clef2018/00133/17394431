Localisation and surgical treatment of insulinomas. Most insulinomas are solitary, benign and functional neuroendocrine pancreatic tumours which give rise to manifold symptoms. Their preoperative localisation is often unclear, but the cure rate after their excision is very high. It was the aim of this study to analyse and evaluate our group of patients with regard to preoperative tumour localisation and overall surgical results. Twelve patients with a biochemical diagnosis of organic hyperinsulinism were surgically treated. Diagnosis was made with the combination of magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, selective angiography and intraoperative portal vein sampling. In five patients, the tumour was enucleated, in three patients Whipple procedure was performed while three patients underwent left pancreatectomy with spleen preserving in two cases. The twelfth patient underwent total pancreatectomy following Whipple procedure performed elsewhere. There was no postoperative death. The complications were two pancreatic fistulas and two wound infections. The fasting pre- and postoperative plasma glucose mean value was 2.8 mm/l and 4.9 mm/l, respectively
