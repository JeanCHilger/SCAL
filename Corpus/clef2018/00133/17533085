Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia is a neoplastic disorder of varying degree and extent that affects the pancreatic ductal epithelium. Clinical presentations may vary from an asymptomatic incidental finding to obstructive jaundice. Harbingers of malignancy include symptoms of jaundice, weight loss, or new-onset diabetes. In the absence of findings that correlate with malignancy, natural history is unknown. Management of these patients is controversial, and should be individualized based on surgical risk.
