Ciliated foregut cyst of pancreas: cytologic findings on endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration. The cytologic findings of a ciliated foregut cyst of the pancreas diagnosed by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) are described. Cytologic features of ciliated foregut cysts include the presence of ciliated columnar cells and detached ciliary tufts in a cystic fluid background with amorphous debris and rare macrophages. These cytologic findings are clearly distinct from those of cystic mucinous neoplasms and other pancreatic cysts with which the ciliated foregut cyst may be confused. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case reporting the cytologic findings of a pancreatic ciliated foregut cyst sampled by endoscopic ultrasound-guided FNA. We believe that the distinctive and characteristic cytologic features can allow a preoperative cytologic diagnosis of this highly unusual pancreatic cystic lesion.
