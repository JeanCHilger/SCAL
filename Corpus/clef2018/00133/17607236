Conservative surgical treatment after complete pancreatic neck rupture. The authors report a case of a complete pancreatic neck rupture treated by conservative surgery. A pancreatic neck rupture was diagnosed on a CT scan performed 24 hours after an abdominal blunt trauma. The patient was treated by suture of the cephalic remnant and Roux-en-Y pancreaticojejunostomy on the left remnant. Postoperative course was uneventful and the patient did not develop diabetes with a 18-month follow-up. This conservative technique, rarely used for complete pancreatic neck rupture, allows preservation of the pancreatic endocrine function.
