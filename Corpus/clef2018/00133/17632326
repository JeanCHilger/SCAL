Focal lymphoplasmacytic sclerosing pancreatitis: radiological-pathological correlation. To correlate cross-sectional imaging findings with histological results in patients with histopathologically proven lymphoplasmacytic sclerosing pancreatitis (LSP) after surgery.Four cases of resectable pancreatic lesions that were proven to represent LSP are presented in our study. All patients were thought to harbor malignancy. A detailed research in patients' records was retrospectively done concerning clinical presentation and imaging studies.Characteristic imaging findings consistent with fibrotic changes were evident in only one case on magnetic resonance imaging. A discrete mass was evident on imaging in 2 patients that correlated well with pathology results. In the other patients, the extent of inflammatory changes on microscopic examination correlated well with the degree of pancreatic head enlargement on imaging studies.Lymphoplasmacytic sclerosing pancreatitis is a particular form of benign inflammatory pancreatic disease that is extremely difficult to diagnose preoperatively. Familiarization with the variable imaging findings is essential and may result in the reduction of the number of patients with LSP who undergo surgical resection.
