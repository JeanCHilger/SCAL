Cystic tumors of the pancreas: ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging features. Cystic tumors of the pancreas are a subset of rare pancreatic tumors that vary from benign to malignant. Many have specific imaging findings that allow them to be differentiated from each other. This article aims to review the histopathologic and imaging findings of the relatively common lesions (serous microcystic adenoma, mucinous cystic tumor, intraductal papillary mucinous tumor, and solid pseudopapillary tumor) and uncommon lesions (cystic endocrine tumors, cystic metastases, cystic teratomas, and lymphangiomas) in this group.
