Uncommon solid pancreatic neoplasms: ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging features. This article reviews the ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging features of rare solid tumors of the pancreas with attention to distinctive imaging appearances, which can help radiologists to discriminate between the different entities. Various uncommon solid pancreatic neoplasms, including exocrine and endocrine epithelial tumors, mesenchymal tumors, and metastases, are reviewed, with emphasis on key differential points, including morphologic features and patterns of contrast enhancement.
