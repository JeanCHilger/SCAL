Spontaneous pancreatic pseudocyst-portal vein fistula presenting with pancreatic ascites: strength of MR cholangiopancreatography. Pancreatic pseudocyst-portal vein fistulae are a very rare complication of acute or chronic pancreatitis. Another late complication of chronic pancreatitis is pancreatic ascites. We report the case of a 43-year-old man with a spontaneous pseudocyst-portal vein fistula presenting with pancreatic ascites diagnosed by various imaging modalities, in order to emphasize the strength and efficacy of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography.
