A case of advanced pancreatic cancer treated successfully with self-expandable stent, PTEG and chemotherapy. A 52-year-old male admitted to our hospital for ileus was diagnosed with advanced pancreatic cancer. He was complicated with multiple alimentary tract stenosis (duodenal third portion, ascending portion and splenic-flexure portion of colon) due to intraabdominal spread of malignancies. The self-expandable metal stent was successfully placed in each stenotic portion with being effectively decompressed of his intestinal obstruction by the procedure of percutaneous transesophageal gastro-tubing (PTEG). These treatments improved his symptoms to ingest orally in addition to the tube feeding per PTEG. Furthermore, he has been receiving adjuvant chemotherapy with GEM, S-1, and CPT-11 for 9 months at outpatient department. We concluded a combined procedure of self-expandable stent and PTEG was useful palliative treatment in malignant gastrointestinal obstruction of advanced pancreatic cancer.
