Islet cell tumor of the pancreas: increasing diagnosis after instituting ultrasonography-guided fine needle aspiration. To review the clinical and cytomorphologic features of pancreatic islet cell tumors (ICT).Computer search identified patients with pancreatic ICT diagnosed by fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) between January 1995 and December 2003. Clinical, radiographic, and cytomorphologic findings were reviewed.Thirty-eight patients (19 men, 19 women median age 60 years, range 30-82) with ICT were identifiedNewer radiography and biopsy techniques to detect and examine smaller pancreatic masses have increased the number of pancreatic ICT diagnoses at our institution. The distinctive cytomorphologic features of pancreatic ICT make it reliably diagnosable by FNAB.
