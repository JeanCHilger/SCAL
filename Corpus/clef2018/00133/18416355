Pancreatic mucinous cystadenoma. We report here the case of a 75-year-old lady who presented to us with a 4-month history of abdominal symptoms. The computed tomography scan revealed a cystic lesion in the tail of the pancreas. Distal pancreatectomy was done and biopsy showed a benign mucinous neoplasm. Because this is potentially malignant it is vital to diagnose it before it becomes malignant identification of this entity remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.
