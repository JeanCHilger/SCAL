Autoimmune pancreatitis: CT patterns and their changes after steroid treatment. To retrospectively evaluate the computed tomographic (CT) patterns of autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) and their changes after steroid therapy.Investigational review board approval was obtained, and the informed consent requirement was waived. The medical and imaging data of 21 patients (13 men, eight women mean age, 47.5 yearsPancreatic parenchyma showed focal enlargement in 14 (67%) patients and diffuse enlargement in seven (33%). Pancreatic parenchyma affected by AIP appeared hypoattenuating in 19 (90%) patients and isoattenuating in two (10%). During the portal venous phase, pancreatic parenchyma showed contrast material retention in 18 (86%) patients and contrast material washout in three (14%). The MPD was never visible within the lesion. After treatment, there was a reduction in the size of pancreatic parenchyma segments affected by AIP (P < .05). Fifteen (71%) of the 21 patients had a normal enhancement pattern in the pancreatic parenchyma, whereas the enhancement pattern remained hypovascular in six (29%). The MPD returned to its normal size within the lesion in all patients at follow-up CT. In one of the eight patients with focal forms of AIP, the upstream MPD remained dilated.AIP appeared as pancreatic parenchyma enlargement, with MPD stenosis within the lesion and upstream dilatation in focal forms of AIP. After steroid treatment, there was normalization of these findings.
