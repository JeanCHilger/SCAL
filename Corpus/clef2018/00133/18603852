Three cases of groove pancreatic carcinoma in which endoscopic ultrasonography was useful for diagnosis before surgery. We had three cases of pancreatic groove carcinoma. All cases developed obstructive jaundice. Duodenoscopy showed stenosis of the second portion of the duodenum in every case. Thus, endoscopic bile duct drainage could not be performed in two cases. CT revealed a mass between the duodenum and head of the pancreas, which was not well-defined by contrast-enhancement. Endoscopic ultrasonography revealed a hypoechoic mass which was adjacent to the common bile duct and duodenum in the pancreas head in all cases. Therefore, we could diagnose pancreatic groove carcinoma.
