Contrast-enhanced ultrasonograpic findings in pancreatic tumors. The purpose of this article is to present the potentials and limits of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) in the characterization of pancreatic tumors, usually hypoechoic or cystic at B-mode ultrasound.As regards hypoechoic lesions at B-mode ultrasound, CEUS often can distinguish among adenocarcinoma, islet cell tumor and serous microcystic adenoma. As regards cystic lesions, CEUS in most cases doesn't add significative diagnostic information therefore CT, MR or endoscopic US are almost always necessary for their proper characterization.
