The role of pancreatic polypeptide in the pathogenesis of malabsorption in ulcerative colitis. Pancreatic function was evaluated in 16 22-56-year-olds with ulcerative colitis. The diagnosis was verified by coprogram, glycemic curves, blood and urine amylase, ultrasound and endoscopic findings. A basal level of pancreatic polypeptide (PP) was measured in blood serum under glucose tolerance test (50 g) using radioimmunoassay. Intracavitary pH-metry provided data on pH in the upper gastrointestinal tract. The results were processed according to Student's t-criterion. The evidence demonstrated pancreatic involvement with secretory and endocrine insufficiency leading to homeostatic derangement of enteral medium and malabsorption in ulcerative colitis. The addition of pancreatic enzymes and antacids is advisable as pathogenetically valid.
