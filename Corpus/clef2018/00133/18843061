Imaging paediatric blunt abdominal trauma in the emergency department: ultrasound versus computed tomography. To determine whether an abdominal ultrasound scan performed by paediatric radiologists is effective in the diagnosis of abdominal injuries in children.A retrospective cohort study was undertaken of all children who presented with blunt abdominal trauma to a paediatric teaching hospital (RHSC) over a 5-year period between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2005. Hospital notes and radiology computer systems were interrogated and data were collected and analysed.Of the 80 children with blunt abdominal trauma, 56 (70%) had abdominal imaging and 23 (30%) had no imaging. Of the 56 imaged, 48 (86%) had an USS of which 25 (52%) were positive (16 demonstrated solid organ injury, 8 free fluid and 1 suspected bladder rupture) 3 of these went on to have a CT scan. 23 had a normal USSAbdominal USS performed by paediatric radiologists is an accurate method of assessing abdominal injuries. However, CT scanning can assess certain abnormalities such as pancreatic or duodenal injuries and small amounts of free intraperitoneal air more accurately. The importance of serial clinical examination must not be overlooked.
