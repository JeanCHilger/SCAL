Cystic tumors of the pancreas. Cystic tumors of the pancreas are diagnosed with increasing frequency. The main problems associated with their diagnosis are to determine if they are benign or malignant and to decide their surgical excision or clinical follow-up, since these tumors can be benign, potentially malignant or malignant. Imaging techniques such as CT scan, magnetic resonance and endoscopic ultrasonography are the key procedures that must be performed before adopting a final therapeutic decision. However, 10% of cystic lesions are unable to be categorized even after thorough imaging evaluation. We analyze the characteristics of the more common cystic pancreatic lesions and the means to recognize them.
