Lupus-associated pancreatitis complicated by pancreatic pseudocyst and central nervous system vasculitis. Pancreatitis is an uncommon manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but this can occasionally cause major complications. We report in this article, a case of 33-year-old female patient who developed lupus-associated pancreatitis that was subsequently complicated by pancreatic pseudocyst and central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed an oedematous swelling of the pancreas and a pseudocyst measuring 4 x 3 cm2. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple high-signal intensity lesions in both cerebral hemispheres. The pseudocyst did not completely resolve with high-dose steroid therapy, and it was later complicated by infection and rupture. After a surgical drainage for the complicated pseudocyst, her clinical symptoms and signs were markedly improved. This case shows the importance of performing early drainage rather than conservative treatment for a pancreatic pseudocyst in a patient with lupus-associated pancreatitis.
