Endoscopic ultrasound in pancreatic disease--its influence on surgical decision-making. An update 2008. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) was introduced about 25 years ago with the primary aim of better visualization of the pancreas as compared to transabdominal ultrasonography. This review discusses the current evidence in 2008 concerning the role of EUS in the clinical management of patients, with a special emphasis on its impact on surgical therapy. According to the literature, good indications are detection of common bile duct stones (e.g. in acute pancreatitis), the detection of small exo- and endocrine pancreatic tumors, the performance of fine-needle aspiration in pancreatic masses depending on therapeutic consequences. In other areas such as diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis and cystic pancreatic lesions, the contribution of EUS seems limited. Pancreatic cancer staging is discussed controversially due to conflicting evidence and certainly has lost grounds due to improvements in CT technology. Therapeutic EUS is, however, more widely accepted and may replace other techniques, e.g. in pancreatic cyst drainage and celiac plexus neurolysis further techniques of interest are being developed.
