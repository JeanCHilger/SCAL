Chronic pancreatitis. As in previous reviews in this journal, this review is focused on the most important new observations in chronic pancreatitis made in the last year.Important observations included the search for biomarkers and alternative methods for the detection of early chronic pancreatitis stellate cell activation and their role in fibrogenesisIn 2007, major advances were made in our understanding of central processing in chronic pancreatitis pain. New techniques are being utilized in search of a better means to diagnose early chronic pancreatitis. Important prospective studies are emerging, which compare endoscopic and surgical interventions. Furthermore, the complexities of diagnosing autoimmune pancreatitis are being recognized. Overall, the future is promising as advances in genomic and proteomic techniques are applied to improve our understanding of chronic pancreatitis.
