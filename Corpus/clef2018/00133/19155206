Pancreatic glucagonoma presenting as a pulmonary mass. Glucagonoma is an uncommon disease, a neuroendocrine tumour that develops from glucagon-producing pancreatic cells. They are usually slow-growing, but generally advanced at diagnosis, and metastatic disease is virtually incurable. Liver is the most common site of metastatic disease. We present the case of a 48-year-old man with a glucagonoma being diagnosed from a pulmonary mass. This case had no liver affection in the whole evolution of the disease, and showed a particularly aggressive course, with very little response to all therapies administered, and a survival from diagnosis of just 16 months.
