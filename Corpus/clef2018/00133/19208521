Pancreatic head carcinoma: clinical analysis of 189 cases. Pancreatic cancer is a lethal disease with an increasing incidence. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data on diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic head carcinoma, and analyzed the factors affecting prognosis of the disease.The data of 189 patients with pancreatic head carcinoma treated from September 1, 1995 to August 31, 2005 were reviewed retrospectively. Ninety-four patients treated from September 1, 2000 to August 31, 2005 were followed up in April 2008. The median survival time (MST) and 1- to 5- year cumulative survival rates of the patients were calculated by the life table method and the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox regression was used to screen out significant risk factors.96.9% of the patients were more than 40 years old, and the male/female ratio was 1.63. The detection rate of transabdominal ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT), endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), and serum tumor marker CA19-9 were 82.0%, 93.1%, 94.7% and 79.8%, respectively. The MST of patients with pancreatic head carcinoma was 360+/-60 days. The 1- to 5-year cumulative survival rates were 50.0%, 19.2%, 12.1%, 9.4% and 4.7%, respectively. However, patients with unresectable tumor survived for a shorter time (183+/-18 days). Their 1- to 2-year cumulative survival rates were 28.3% and 0.0%. Cox regression analysis showed that in pancreatic head carcinoma, the independent predictors for prognosis included tumor size, invasion of the superior mesenteric vessel, and radical resection. The MST of patients with pancreatic head carcinoma after radical resection was 510 days, significantly longer than that of patients undergoing non-specific treatment and palliative therapy (225 days). In addition, patients with slight jaundice survived for the longest time (533+/-51 days), compared with patients with severe jaundice (236+/-43 days) and without jaundice (392+/-109 days).Pancreatic head carcinoma is easily misdiagnosed, and is usually found to be advanced when tumor size is too large (above 4 cm in diameter) with local spread or metastatic disease. In these cases, surgical resection is usually not feasible, and its prognosis is usually very poor. Therefore, careful attention should be paid to these high-risk patients, especially, males, more than 40 years old, and presenting slight jaundice. Then imaging examination (US, CT and EUS) and serum tumor marker examination (CA19-9) are used to detect this disease earlier, and perform curative resection earlier. In this way, it is possible to cure the patients with a longer survival time and better quality of life.
