Eleven-year survivor of unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma treated using long-term UFT therapy. We report a 49-year-old man with unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) who was treated with oral tegafur-uracil (UFT) chemotherapy and survived for over a decade. In 1995, the patient was admitted to our institution after a large tumor in his left liver was detected using computed tomography (CT). The tumor was diagnosed as ICC, and a laparotomy was performed however, the tumor was too advanced to perform a curative resection. The cancer had spread to the lymph nodes in the hepatoduodenal ligament and on the posterior surface of the pancreas head. A curative resection was abandoned, and oral UFT chemotherapy was started immediately after the laparotomy. The tumor remained almost unchanged until 2001 with only UFT administration
