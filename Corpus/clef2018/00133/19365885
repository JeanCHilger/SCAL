Hypoglycemia induced by long-acting somatostatin analogues in a patient with nonfunctional neuroendocrine tumor. Somatostatin and its long-acting analogues are effective in symptom control in patients with functional neuroendocrine tumors they are also able to control tumor growth. Somatostatin analogues are safe and generally well tolerated. In some cases they may cause serious complications. Somatostatin analogues are potent inhibitors of growth hormone (GH) and glucagon secretion. They cause impairment of hepatic glucose output and delay in intestinal absorption of carbohydrates. Patients with huge tumor mass and multiple liver metastases have increased risk of tumor-induced hypoglycemia. In these patients, long-acting octreotide may trigger serious hypoglycemia. The patients whose glucose control is dependent on counter-regulatory hormones should be monitored for the possibility of hypoglycemia. Herein, we present a patient with severe and prolonged hypoglycemia after long-acting octreotide treatment.
