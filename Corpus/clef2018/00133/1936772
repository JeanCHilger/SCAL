Pancreatic cavernous hemangioma: CT, MRI, US, and angiography characteristics. A large pancreatic cavernous hemangioma was found in a 30-year-old man with abdominal distention. Plain and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasonography (US), and angiography were performed prior to operation. Contrast-enhanced CT and angiography showed a large poorly enhanced hypovascular tumor at the head of the pancreas. But MRI and US disclosed findings compatible with a cavernous hemangioma.
