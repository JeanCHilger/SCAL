Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) from a radiological and gastroenterological perspective. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in combination with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is an integrated part in the diagnosis of bile-duct diseases and requires a standaridized complex examination technique. Radiologic and gastroenterologic indications are the diagnosis of anomalies, concrements, chronic inflammations and tumor diagnosis, especially of cholangiocarinoma such as Klatskin tumor and pancreatic cancer. MRCP is integrated in the preinterventional concept for performing invasive endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and for follow-up post intervention and for diagnosing complications.
