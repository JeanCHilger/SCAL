Limitations in improving detection of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. To review the current trends in pancreatic cancer research and propose alternatives for an earlier diagnosis.A search was conducted using the PubMed and Scielo electronic databases to find statistics related to the incidence of pancreatic cancer.Pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer mortality in the USA in Colombia the incidence of this neoplasia is 4.5 per 100,000 individualsThe prognosis for pancreatic cancer has not changed substantially for at least the last 20 years. The most useful tumor marker for pancreatic adenocarcinoma is still the carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9). Currently, a multimodal-screening approach of endoscopic ultrasound, computed tomography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography are the most effective methods to detect pancreatic cancer in high-risk patients. Future options for early detection of this malignancy are focused on new molecular markers, telomerase enzyme, receptor-targeted imaging using multifunctional nanoparticles, detection of glycan changes and epigenetics.
