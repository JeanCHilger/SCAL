Interventional EUS for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Since the curved linear array echoendoscope (linear EUS) was developed in the 1990s, EUS has evolved from EUS imaging, to EUS-guided FNA, and now to EUS-guided fine needle injection (FNI), giving EUS even wider application. This advancement has brought "interventional EUS" into the pancreato-biliary field. Interventional EUS for pancreatic cancer includes delivery of contrast agents, drainage/anastomosis, celiac neurolysis (including ganglion neorolysis), radiofrequency ablation, photodynamic therapy, brachytherapy, and delivery of a growing number of anti-tumor agents. This review will focus on interventional EUS in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
