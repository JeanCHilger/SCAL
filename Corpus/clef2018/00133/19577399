Enhancement of abdominal organs on hepatic arterial phase: quantitative comparison between 1.5- and 3.0-T magnetic resonance imaging. To compare the extent of enhancement of abdominal organs as shown on subphases of hepatic arterial phase quantitatively between 1.5- and 3.0-T MRI among patients with various abdominal conditions.A total of 126 patients, of whom 68 were women (age range, 3-82 years mean age, 48 years) and 58 were men (age range, 6-73 yearsThe kidney, spleen, pancreas and liver demonstrated 1.79- to 2.45-, 1.65- to 1.97-, 1.66- to 1.8- and 1.1- to 2.02-fold higher enhancement on the subphases of hepatic arterial phase at 3.0 T compared to 1.5 T, respectively. The differences in contrast enhancement were significant for the kidney, pancreas and spleen on all subphases between 1.5 and 3.0 T.The relative enhancement of the kidney, spleen and pancreas is consistently and significantly higher at 3.0 T than at 1.5 T in matched subphases of hepatic arterial enhancement.
