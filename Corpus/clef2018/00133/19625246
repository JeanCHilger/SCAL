Successful treatment of persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia with nifedipine in an adult patient. To describe the successful treatment of severe noninsulinoma hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia with use of a calcium channel blocking agent in an adult patient who had previously undergone a gastric bypass surgical procedure.A 65-year-old woman who had undergone a gastric bypass surgical procedure 26 years earlier was hospitalized because of severe postprandial hypoglycemia. During and after hospitalization, the patient underwent assessment with conventional measurements of glucose, insulin, proinsulin, and C-peptide toxicologic studiesMetabolic variables were consistent with the diagnosis of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed the presence of a side branch intraductal papillary mucinous tumor that had been stable for more than 1 year. The results of the calcium-stimulated insulin release study were consistent with nonlocalized hypersecretion of insulin. A trial of frequent small feedings failed to prevent hypoglycemia. On the basis of reports of successful treatment of childhood nesidioblastosis, the patient was then prescribed nifedipine, 30 mg daily. She has subsequently remained free of symptomatic hypoglycemia for 20 months.A calcium channel blocking agent may be efficacious and a potential alternative to partial pancreatectomy in cases of noninsulinoma hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia in adults.
