Diagnosis and follow-up of small intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas. Intraductal papillary mucinous tumours are diagnosed more and more often fortuitously. Initial work-up relies on CT scan, CP-MRI and endoscopic ultrasound of excellent technical quality. Their aspect might be extremely proteiform. They usually appear as cystic lesion, unique or multiple, localized or diffuse, involving main or branch pancreatic duct. The communication between the cystic lesion and the ductal system is essential for diagnosis. If main pancreatic duct is not involved and in absence of mural nodules, it is recommended not to resect them and to initiate follow-up. The follow-up examination relies on CP-MRI and, in case of symptomatic or imaging modifications, on endoscopic ultrasound. The interval between follow-up examinations remains to be determined. In case of imaging change might lead to resection.
