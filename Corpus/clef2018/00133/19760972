MDCT in the early recognition of isolated non-penetrating pancreatic transection. Isolated pancreatic transection is rare. Associated main pancreatic duct injury is the principal determinant factor of outcome. Earlier computed tomographic scanner may be unreliable in determining the location and severity of pancreatic injury. Multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) and curved views of multidetector computed tomography are helpful in accurate diagnosis of pancreatic transection with the main pancreatic duct injury.
