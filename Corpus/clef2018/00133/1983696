Insulinoma--diagnosis and therapy. Insulin-producing tumors of the pancreas are characterised by clinical symptoms and the lack of correlation between serum insulin and blood glucose concentrations. CT and angiography are major diagnostic procedures. Surgical therapy prefers enucleation of the tumor together with the capsule. Today blind resections can be avoided.
