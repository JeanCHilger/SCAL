An unusual variant of anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction in a patient with pancreas divisum diagnosed with secretin-magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. Anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction is an unusual variant of pancreaticobiliary anatomy of clinical importance because it is associated with increased risk of pancreatitis and, also, for the development of cholangiocarcinoma. We report an unusual variant of anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction, occurring in a patient with pancreas divisum, with an anomalous communication between the dorsal pancreatic and the common bile duct. The patient presented with a distal biliary stricture. This variant anatomy was occult on magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography but was diagnosed on magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography that was performed with intravenous secretin administration and further delineated by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. The features that allowed the diagnosis to be made and the implications of this diagnosis are described in this report.
