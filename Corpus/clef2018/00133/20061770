Acute necrotizing pancreatitis with pancreatic abscess due to Prevotella species in a diabetic. Acute pancreatitis occasionally presents as pancreatic abscess with complications like pleural effusion and ascites. There are several pre-disposing factors, the most common being cholelithiaisis, alcohol abuse, infective causes, trauma, and metabolic causes such as diabetic ketoacidosis, while some cases are idiopathic. Here, we report a rare case of acute necrotizing pancreatitis in a 40-year-old male who presented with pain in the abdomen, ascites and left basal pleural effusion. A computerized tomography (CT) scan showed findings suggestive of pancreatic necrosis, with abscess formation and free-fluid surrounding area. The aspirated pus sample was processed for Gram staining and culture, which yielded growth of Prevotella species in an anaerobic culture. Exploratory laparotomy was performed and intra-abdominal collection drained. Necrosectomy of the distal tail and body of the pancreas was performed. The patient was started on antibiotics and along with supportive treatment, responded well.
