Evaluation of the biliary and pancreatic system with 2D SSFSE, breathhold 3D FRFSE and respiratory-triggered 3D FRFSE sequences. The authors compared biliary and pancreatic imaging obtained through 2D single-shot fast spin-echo (SSFSE), breath-hold 3D fast recovery fast spin-echo (FRFSE) and respiratory-triggered 3D FRFSE sequences.A total of 106 magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) examinations performed between December 2007 and September 2008 were evaluated with a comparison of 2D SSFSE (thin section and thick slab), breath-hold 3D FRFSE and respiratory-triggered 3D FRFSE sequences. The biliary tract was divided into seven segments: right hepatic duct, left hepatic duct, common hepatic duct, cystic duct, common bile duct, cystic duct junction and biliary-pancreatic confluence. The main pancreatic duct was divided into three segments (head, body and tail). Visualisation of biliary variants was also compared. Two blinded radiologists evaluated segment visibility using a quantitative scale. The Student's t test for paired samples was used for statistical analysis.Compared with 2D SSFSE, respiratory-triggered 3D FRFSE sequences showed better visibility of the right hepatic duct (p=0.0277), the cystic duct (p=0.0081), the cystic duct junction (p=0.0010), the biliary-pancreatic confluence (p=0.0334) and biliary variants (p=0.0198). In the comparison between breath-hold 3D FRFSE and 2D SSFSE, a significant statistical difference was found in visualisation of the cystic duct (p=0.027), the cystic duct junction (p=0.020), the biliary-pancreatic confluence (p=0.0338) and biliary variants (p=0.0311).Three-dimensional FRFSE offers a significant benefit over conventional 2D imaging.
