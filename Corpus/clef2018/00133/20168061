A case of acinar cell carcinoma of pancreas, manifested by subcutaneous nodule as initial clinical symptom. Pancreas acinar cell carcinoma (ACC) accounts for only 1-2% of pancreatic exocrine malignant tumor. The symptoms of patients with ACC are usually non-specific, for example the anorexia and weight loss. Patients may develop Schmid's triad including subcutaneous fat necrosis, polyarthritis, and eosinophilia. We reported a case of ACC which was manifested by subcutaneous nodule as initial clinical symptom. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of ACC presenting as subcutaneous fat necrosis in Korea.
