Solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas in children: typical radiological findings and pathological correlation. We report a case series of three children with solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas (SPT) in which a complete radiological work-up, including ultrasound, computed tomography scans, and MRI, has been carried out. The aim of this article is to highlight the characteristic imaging findings of SPT in the pediatric age group and to establish a correlation with typical histopathological findings of the lesion.
