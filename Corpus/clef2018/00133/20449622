Metastasectomy for renal cell carcinoma as a strategy to obtain complete remission. We report a case of 67-year-old Japanese woman with two types of metastasectomy for metachronous metastases of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The initial nephrectomy for left RCC was performed in April 1977. The pathological diagnosis was clear cell carcinoma grade1-2, pT1b. In May 1996, computed tomography (CT) revealed a tumor in the upper pole of the remaining right kidney. The renal tumor was enucleated in June 1996. The histopathological diagnosis of the tumors was clear cell carcinoma. In December 1998, conventional B-mode ultrasound US detected solid tumors in the uncus, body, and tail of pancreas, and the patient underwent partial pancreatectomy, preserving the pancreatic head. Histologically, the tumor consisted of clear cell carcinoma. ElevenÂ years following the second metastasectomy, patient was disease free without adjuvant therapy.
