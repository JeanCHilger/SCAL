Metabolic syndrome and ectopic fat deposition: what can CT and MR provide? Metabolic syndrome affects 20-30% of adults and is increasing in prevalence, making it a leading public health issue. Radiologists often encounter images of obese patients during routine studies and are in a unique position to address the importance of excess fat and need to be aware of the spectrum of pathologic consequences in different organ systems. In this review, the role of CT and MR imaging in assessment of patients with metabolic syndrome will be reviewed and the constellation of structural and functional changes in the major affected organ systems due to ectopic fatty deposition will be discussed.We specifically discuss the pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome, visceral versus subcutaneous obesity, cardiac lipomatosis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, nonalcoholic fatty pancreas disease, and fat deposition in other organs.Many of the multisystem manifestations of metabolic syndrome can be visualized on routine CT and MR images and radiologists can provide clinicians with important data regarding anatomic and pathologic distribution of fat in different organs. Perhaps the visualization of the fatty changes will provide tangible evidence to motivate patients to begin lifestyle modification.
