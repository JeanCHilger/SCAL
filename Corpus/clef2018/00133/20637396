Isolated traumatic pancreatic rupture. Traumatic pancreatic rupture is associated with high morbidity and mortality. The diagnosis is difficult and usually accompanied with other injuries. We reported a 17-year-old adolescent boy who experienced this disease alone. The diagnosis was first suspected in ultrasonography and then confirmed by computed tomography. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography showed his pancreatic duct was patent. He made an uneventful recovery after 10 days of hospitalization. Ultrasonography is well known for detecting the presence of hemoperitoneum in blunt abdominal trauma. Furthermore, it can be applied to the assessment of patients with posttraumatic abdominal pain. It provides a real-time, noninvasive, and inexpensive means for screening this kind of patients.
