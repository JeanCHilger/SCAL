Superparamagnetic particles as oral contrast medium in MR imaging of malignant lymphoma. Non-biodegradable superparamagnetic particles, in plain and viscous aqueous suspensions, were used as an oral contrast medium in 34 patients with known or suspected malignant lymphoma. The contrast effect, the occurrence of artifacts, and the distribution were evaluated in the plain and the viscous aqueous suspensions, and the diagnostic information received from abdominal MR examinations performed without bowel contrast medium was compared with that of post-contrast examinations. Magnetic particles in the concentration of 0.5 g/l displayed a good contrast effect at 0.5 T, and helped in differentiating the intestine from adjacent tissues, resulting in increased diagnostic information in abdominal MR imaging. In the patients given the viscous aqueous suspension the occurrence of artifacts caused by the magnetic particles decreased considerably, and the distribution was homogeneous and improved compared with that in patients given the plain aqueous suspension.
