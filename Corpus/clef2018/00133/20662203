Recent advances on EUS, EUS-FNA. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) has widened its applications and been become an indispensable examination. Recent advances is as follows: Electronic radial scanning EUS, three-dimensional EUS (3D-EUS), enhancement, elastography, and EUS-FNA. Because of electronic radial scanning EUS, we can employ Doppler function. 3D-EUS have introduced not only preciseness for preoperative evaluation for EMR and ESD but also surface rendering similar to endoscopic image. Enhancement and elastography have a possibility of tissue chracterization. First EUS-FNA, in which Vilmann reported fine needle aspiration cytology of pancreas cancer and Grimm treated a case with pseudocyst, were made in 1992. Then EUS-FNA has become popular in the clinical fields and the accuracy of diagnostic EUS-FNA has been reported 70 to 100%. Furthermore EUS-FNA has also widened its applications to therapeutic techniques such as pseudocyst drainage, biliary drainage, pancreatic duct drainage, celiac plexus neurolysis (CPN), ethanol injection therapy, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), immunotherapy, and gene therapy etc. Finally, EUS-FNA is the future promising technique which has potential for developing new treatments.
