Value of computed tomography and celiomesenteric angiography in assessing vascular involvement in cancer of the exocrine pancreas. Apropos of 31 cases. The prediction of vascular involvement by computed tomography (CT) with intravenous bolus contrast medium enhancement was compared to that of angiography in 31 patients with pancreatic carcinoma. CT was performed in 29 patients, angiography in 18 patients, while 16 had both investigations. Results of both radiological investigations were reviewed and compared with surgical findings. Sensitivity and specificity of CT was 88 and 100 percent respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of angiography was 57 and 100 percent respectively. The four false-negative results of CT concerned the superior mesenteric and portal veins. The ten false-negative results of angiography concerned the superior mesenteric and portal veins in four cases, and the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries in six cases. Comparison of results of CT and angiography revealed that the two methods concurred in 12 patients, five without and seven with vascular involvement. In three other cases, CT detected more abnormal vessels than angiography. In another case, only CT demonstrated nonresectability. In conclusion, CT with enhancement seems to be more accurate than angiography in the prediction of vascular involvement of pancreatic carcinoma.
