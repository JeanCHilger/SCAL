Optimising diffusion-weighted imaging in the abdomen and pelvis: comparison of image quality between monopolar and bipolar single-shot spin-echo echo-planar sequences. To compare geometric distortion, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), efficacy of fat suppression and presence of artefact between monopolar (Stejskal and Tanner) and bipolar (twice-refocused, eddy-current-compensating) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequences in the abdomen and pelvis.A semiquantitative distortion index (DI) was derived from the subtraction images with b = 0 and 1,000 s/mm(2) in a phantom and compared between the two sequences. Seven subjects were imaged with both sequences using four b values (0, 600, 900 and 1,050 s/mm(2)) and SNR, ADC for different organs and fat-to-muscle signal ratio (FMR) were compared. Image quality was evaluated by two radiologists on a 5-point scale.DI was improved in the bipolar sequence, indicating less geometric distortion. SNR was significantly lower for all tissues and b values in the bipolar images compared with the monopolar (p < 0.05), whereas FMR was not statistically different. ADC in liver, kidney and sacrum was higher in the bipolar scheme compared to the monopolar (p < 0.03), whereas in muscle it was lower (p = 0.018). Image quality scores were higher for the bipolar sequence (p ≤ 0.025).Artefact reduction makes the bipolar DWI sequence preferable in abdominopelvic applications, although the trade-off in SNR may compromise ADC measurements in muscle.
