Surgical management of benign duodenal tumours. While benign duodenal tumours are rare compared with malignant tumours, they comprise a wide variety of pathologies. Despite their diagnostic challenge, the optimal management of benign duodenal tumours remains undefined. We aimed to review the diagnosis and surgical treatment of benign duodenal tumours.Records of all patients with post-operative pathological diagnosis of benign duodenal tumour were retrieved. Information on clinical presentations, diagnostic methods, tumour locations, surgical approaches, pathological results and patient outcomes were analysed.The operative spectrum included local resection in 8 cases, segmental duodenectomy in 1 case, subtotal gastrectomy in 1 case, papilla resection with sphincteroplasty in 3 cases and pancreaticoduodenectomy in 5 cases. The post-operative pathology results indicated 5 cases of adenoma, 2 cases of tubular adenoma, 2 cases of villous adenoma, 2 cases of tubulovillous adenoma, 2 cases of hamartoma and 1 case each of hamartomatous polyp, Brunner's adenoma, adenomyoma, fibromatosis and ectopic pancreas. Post-operatively, one patient died of unrelated disease, one case was lost in follow-up and the remaining patients survived recurrence-free with a good quality of life.The presentation of benign duodenal tumours is non-specific, with upper abdominal discomfort and upper gastrointestinal bleeding as common symptoms. Surgical resection is the preferable therapeutic choice with satisfactory prognosis.
