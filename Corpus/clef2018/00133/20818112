Splenic mass and isolated gastric varices: a rare presentation of a neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas. Splenic involvement in neuroendocrine pancreatic tumors is well known but rarely presents as a primary splenic mass.A rare case of a neuroendocrine tumor involving the tail of the pancreas, splenic hilum and splenic flexure of the colon, forming a conglomerate mass and presenting as isolated gastric varices is described. A 75-year-old male presented with hematemesis and melena. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed isolated gastric varices. A CT scan revealed a mass predominantly involving the spleen and a small part of the pancreas.A splenic mass with isolated gastric varices should be kept in mind as one of the presentations of a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor.
