The patient developed severe ischemic encephalopathy, leading to death. Possible causes of acute pancreatitis in a context of cardiopulmonary resuscitation are discussed.In case of abdominal distension following cardiac arrest, diagnoses of mesenteric ischemia and acute ischemic pancreatitis should be considered. Such digestive complications occurring after cardiac arrest probably reflect the severity of the ischemia.
