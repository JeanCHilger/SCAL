Incidence and characteristics of pancreatic cystic neoplasms. Cystic neoplasms (CN) of the pancreas represent 10% of cystic lesions and 1% of pancreatic tumors. Mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN), serous cystadenoma (SC) and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) are cystic neoplasms and represent more than 90% of these types of lesion. Few series have been published on these lesions, especially in Spain.To evaluate the incidence, characteristics and survival of patients with cystic neoplasms attended in our hospital in the last 12 years.A retrospective analysis was carried out in all patients diagnosed with CN between January 1997 and December 2008. Diagnosis was made by abdominal computed tomography, pancreatic-magnetic resonance imaging and/or endoscopic ultrasonography. Sex, age, year of diagnosis, symptoms, tumoral location and size, type of surgery, pathology, and survival were evaluated.A total of 117 patients were analyzed. The mean age was 63Â±14 years and 56% were women. Eighty-eight patients had IPMN, 21 had SC and eight had MCN. Fifty-six per cent were diagnosed in the last 4 years, 42.7% were diagnosed as an incidental finding and 19% had a history of acute pancreatitis. The most frequent location was the pancreatic head (53%). The mean imaging size was 32mm. Surgical resection was performed in 69.2% of the patients. Twenty-three percent of the tumors were malignant, 30% were carcinoma in situ and 70% were invasive. Thirteen percent of the patients died of these 93.3% had invasive carcinoma. Five-year survival was 94.7% in SC, 76% in IPMN and 60% in MCN.CN were mainly identified as incidental findings, although acute pancreatitis is another possible cause. The most frequent tumor in our environment is IPMN. Surgical treatment of IPMN and MCN, at the right moment, may be useful to prevent the development of pancreatic carcinoma.
