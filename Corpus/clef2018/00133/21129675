Pancreatic cancer. About 7200 new cases of pancreatic adenocarcinomas are diagnosed each year in France. At the time of diagnosis, an efficient carcinologic surgery will not be possible for nearly 80% of patients, in relation to loco-regional extension or metastatic dissemination. After surgical resection, the median survival of resected patients ranges from 12 to 20 months, with a high rate of relapses. Currently, the use of radiotherapy for patients with pancreatic cancer is controversial. In adjuvant setting, the standard treatment is six months of chemotherapy with FUFOL or gemcitabine. Chemoradiation (CRT) may improve the survival of patients with incompletely resected tumors (R1). This must be validated in a prospective trial. Neoadjuvant CRT is a promising treatment but always under evaluation. For the treatment of patients with locally advanced tumors, there is not a standart treatment. A strategy of initial chemotherapy followed by CRT for non progressive patients is under evaluation. Whereas in the first trials of CRT large fields were used, the current trend is to reduce the treated volumes to improve tolerance. The delineation of target volumes has been improved by the use of simulation CT. The aims of this work are to precise the radio-anatomical particularities, the pattern of spread of pancreatic cancer and the principles of 3D conformal radiotherapy illustrated with a clinical case.
