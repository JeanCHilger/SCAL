Current use of CT in the evaluation and management of injured patients. From its beginnings as a time consuming and an inefficient imaging modality with no place in the evaluation of traumatically injured patients, computed axial tomographic (CT) scanners have evolved to yield rapid, highly sensitive images, revolutionizing trauma management protocols. This article describes the fundamentals of CT and the imaging protocols and discusses the use of CT in diagnosing injuries to various regions, such as abdomen, liver, spleen, pancreas, kidney, and chest.
