Sonographic findings in groove pancreatitis. Groove pancreatitis is a rare form of chronic pancreatitis involving the anatomic plane between the pancreatic head and duodenum. The radiographic diagnosis remains challenging, and most patients undergo exploratory laparotomy on suspicion of a periampullary malignancy. The appearance of groove pancreatitis on transabdominal and intraoperative sonography has rarely been reported in the literature. The sonographic findings in our 2 patients included a hypoechoic thin area between the pancreatic head and duodenum, a hyperechoic and thickened wall of the adjacent duodenum, and a heterogeneous or hyperechoic dorsocranial part of the pancreatic head.
