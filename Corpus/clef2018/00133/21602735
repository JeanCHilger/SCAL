Patient preferences after endoscopic ultrasound with fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) diagnosis of pancreas cancer: rapid communication valued over long-term relationships. Endoscopic ultrasound with fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is used for the diagnosis of pancreatic malignancy. However, there are limited data as to patient preferences regarding the delivery of cancer diagnoses.This study aimed to assess if patients had met the endosonographer before their EUS, their suspicion of having cancer, and whether they would like the cytology results given to them by their referring physician (with whom they had a previous relationship) or the endosonographer. This question was also asked with respect to the timing of receiving cytology results.A total of 131 patients with a suspected solid pancreatic mass undergoing EUS-FNA at 2 tertiary referral centers were prospectively enrolled and completed a preprocedure questionnaire.One hundred twenty patients (92%) had not met the endosonographer before their EUS-FNA, and only 37 patients (28%) thought they had a pancreatic malignancy. Of the 131 patients, 89 (68%) stated that they wanted to hear results from the endosonographer (P = 0.0001) and 100 patients (76%) chose to hear results as soon as possible from the endosonographer (P = 0.001).Our data highlight the importance of the endosonographer's role in the delivery of cancer diagnoses and that patients value expediency of reporting results over long-term physician relationships.
