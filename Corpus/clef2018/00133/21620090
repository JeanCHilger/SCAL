Pulmonary tuberculosis in an HIV- and hepatitis C virus-coinfected kidney-pancreas transplant recipient: a case report. Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious infection in immunocompromised patients, such as solid organ transplant recipients and HIV-infected patients. The diagnosis and treatment in this population present several challenges because of the aspecific clinical manifestations, the difficulty in diagnosis, and the choice of the most appropriate therapeutic regimen. Therapeutic challenges arise from drug-related toxicities, interactions between immunosuppressive, antiretroviral, and antituberculous drugs. We present a case of primary TB infection that occurred 3 years after transplantation in a HIV-and hepatitis C virus-coinfected kidney-pancreas recipient. The infection was successfully treated with no hepatotoxicity or rejection with a non-rifampin-containing regimen.
