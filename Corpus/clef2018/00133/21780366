Single-domain antibody bioconjugated near-IR quantum dots for targeted cellular imaging of pancreatic cancer. Successful targeted imaging of BxPC3 human pancreatic cancer cells is feasible with near-IR CdTeSe/CdS quantum dots (QDs) functionalized with single-domain antibody (sdAb) 2A3. For specific targeting, sdAbs are superior to conventional antibodies, especially in terms of stability, aggregation, and production cost. The bright CdTeSe/CdS QDs were synthesized to emit in the diagnostic window of 650-900 nm with a narrow emission band. 2A3 was derived from llama and is small in size of  13 kDa, but with fully-functional recognition to the target carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 6 (CEACAM6), a possible biomarker as a therapeutic target of pancreatic cancer. For compelling imaging, optical may be the most sensible among the various imaging modalities, regarding the sensitivity and cost. This first report on sdAb-conjugated near-IR QDs with high signal to background sensitivity for targeted cellular imaging brings insights into the development of optical molecular imaging for early stage cancer diagnosis.
