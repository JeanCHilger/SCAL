Pancreatic duct compliance after secretin stimulation: a novel endoscopic ultrasound diagnostic tool for chronic pancreatitis. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) evaluation of pancreatic duct compliance after secretin stimulation (sEUS) along with EUS morphologic examination (EUS) and duodenal fluid [HCO3] measurement (endoscopic pancreatic function test, ePFT) in 1 endoscopic session has not been reported as a means of evaluating for chronic pancreatitis (CP). We evaluated the feasibility of the combined examination and compared EUS measurements of pancreatic ductal compliance with duodenal fluid [HCO3] for diagnosing CP.The study is a prospective case series of patients with suspected CP who underwent a combined EUS, sEUS, and ePFT examination in 1 endoscopic session. The main outcome measures were the feasibility of performing the combination examination and the correlation between ductal compliance and ePFT.All examinations were completed in 1 endoscopic session, and there were no complications in 35 patients. Although there was a trend toward less change from baseline head and body ductal diameter in patients with CP, only the percent change from baseline in the tail was significant (CP 144.3% vs healthy patients 240.9%, P < 0.01). Regression analysis demonstrated fair correlation between maximum change in ductal diameter and duodenal fluid [HCO3] (r = 0.27).Combined EUS, sEUS, and ePFTs are feasible and safe, with preliminary results demonstrating a positive correlation between pancreatic ductal compliance and duodenal fluid [HCO3].
