Usefulness of in-phase and out-of-phase magnetic resonance imaging for the detection of pancreatic lymphoepithelial cyst. Lymphoepithelial cyst (LEC) of the pancreas is a rare benign lesion that may mimic cystic neoplasms. Diagnosis of pancreatic LEC has been depended on the elevation of serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9), biopsy of the cyst by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and several abdominal imaging techniques including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, it is very difficult to diagnose LEC of the pancreas preoperatively and excessive surgery has been done in spite of its benign nature. We herein report a case of pancreatic LEC which was preoperatively diagnosed by using in-phase and out-of-phase MRI and was successfully nucleated.
