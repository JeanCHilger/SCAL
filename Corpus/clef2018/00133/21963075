Pancreatic pseudocyst in children: what is the best therapeutic approach?. Pancreatic pseudocyst is an uncommon disorder in children and the majority of reported cases are secondary to trauma.Treatment options range from medical management to different forms of drainage procedure. The aim of this study was to discuss therapeutic strategies.The authors report herein pancreatic pseudocyst in four children aged 7, 9, 12, and 13 years with non-resolving pancreatic pseudocyst over a 2-year period from January 2006 to July 2008. The etiology of pancreatic pseudocyst was abdominal trauma in two cases and acute pancreatitis in two cases. Ultrasound and computed tomography scans confirmed the diagnosis. Two patients had endoscopic drainage. There were no procedure-related complications, nor was there a recurrence of the cyst. In one case, the pancreatic pseudocyst resolved spontaneously.This report suggests that children with non-spontaneously resolving pancreatic pseudocyst can be treated successfully and safely with endoscopic drainage. Surgical treatment remains an important alternative in the therapeutic armamentarium of this affection.
