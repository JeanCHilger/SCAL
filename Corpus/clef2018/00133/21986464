Evolving management of pancreatic injury. In this study we present a concise review of the evolving management of traumatic injury to the pancreas, including diagnostic approaches and options for operative and nonoperative intervention.New diagnostic adjuncts can be used for the evaluation of injury to the pancreas and pancreatic duct. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) are used as diagnostic modalities for duct evaluation. ERCP can be therapeutic with sphincterotomy and/or stenting for duct disruption. Computed tomography scan is the initial imaging study of choice for pancreatic injury, but is also used for drainage of pancreatic abscesses or pseudocysts.Nonoperative management of solid organ injuries is the recommended treatment in hemodynamically stable patients. This strategy is now being successfully applied to pancreatic injuries in specific situations. However, the mainstays of pancreatic injury remain the same. The identification of pancreatic duct injury is the top priority. Management includes distal resection, debridement, and closed suction drainage of pancreatic injuries.
