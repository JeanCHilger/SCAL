Pancreatic lipomatosis with massive steatorrhea. Fat replacement of the exocrine pancreas is a rare cause of exocrine pancreatic failure. We report a case of 32-year-old man with weight loss and massive steatorrhea in whom abdominal computed tomography (CT) was diagnostic of pancreatic lipomatosis. The diagnosis was confirmed by needle aspiration cytological (FNAC) examination. Then oral pancreatic enzyme replacement in association with cimetidine led to a marked reduction of steatorrhea and weight gain. In this report it is emphasized that this lipomatosis can be demonstrated by non-invasive technique using abdominal CT-scan.
