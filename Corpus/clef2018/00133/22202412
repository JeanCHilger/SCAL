A case of intraductal mucinous neoplasms with the whole main pancreatic duct dilation treated via segment pancreatectomy. The patient was a 77-year-old woman. She was diagnosed as intraducal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN). She refused an operation for 3 years. After all, a nodule in the main pancreatic duct was pointed out, she agreed and was referred to us. Her past history showed pacemaker implantation for third-degree atrioventricular block, and no impaired glucose tolerance. Abdominal CT showed a dilated whole pancreatic duct and a multilocular cystic tumor. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography showed a marked dilation of the main pancreatic duct. We diagnosed as main duct IPMN. Intraoperative US showed no nodule in pancreatic duct, and there was no suspicious lesion of invasive cancer. We performed segmental pancreatectomy between the left side of common bile duct and the pancreas tail. The tumor was resected with clear margins. Both cut-ends of the main pancreatic duct were anastomosed to a jejunal loop. The postoperative course was excellent. She was discharged on day 16. The glycemic control was good, she needed no treatment for diabetes. Total pancreatectomy has many problems such as insulin and pancreatic polypeptide deficiency, hypoglycemia, malabsorption, diarrhea and liver dysfunction. We avoided total pancreatectomy so that her quality of life was maintained. Still a careful follow -up is required.
