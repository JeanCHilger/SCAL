Neuroendocrine tumours of the upper gastrointestinal tract, characteristics and comparison of localization diagnostics. In daily clinical practice it's important to think of neuroendocrine tumors, since their prevalence for the past 5 years exceeded even the common occurrences of stomach, esophageal and pancreatic cancers. Patients diagnosed early and accurately with NET, have a greater chance for complete cure. The diagnostic tools over the past century were significantly inefficient in diagnosing NET i.e. (40% of tumors were not localized after USG, CT, MRI, AG investigations). Until the past 2 decades that major turnover in diagnostic methods has been achieved. In particular, the introduction of the somatostatine receptor scintigrafy (SRS) and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) have increased sensitivity of localization diagnostics up to 90%. Our work is to test the success of the localization diagnostics in 22 patients with surgically and histologically confirmed NET ofthe pancreas and duodenum. These patients fulfilled jointly SRS, CT and/or MRI, but also classic USG and EUS. From our comparison, clearly endoscopic USG is the most efficient tool with 90% sensitivity.
