Accessory spleen mimicking a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. A 60-year-old man underwent computed tomography as part of colorectal cancer follow-up. A hypervascular nodule was found within the pancreatic tail and subsequently proved to be positive on [111In] DTPA-octreotide scan. A neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas was supposed and a distal pancreatectomy performed. Heterotopic splenic tissue was finally proved by pathological examination. The present case suggests that intrapancreatic accessory spleen be considered in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic lesions positive on [111In] DTPA-octreotide scan.
