Pediatric multifocal myofibroblastic tumors with involvement of the gallbladder: HIV- and Epstein-Barr virus-associated smooth muscle cell tumors. Epstein-Barr virus associated smooth muscle cell tumors are commonly found in immunocompromised patients. These tumors occur most commonly in patients with AIDS and with greater incidence in children. The incidence of gallbladder tumors in these patients is rare, however. We report the case of a 10-year-old female patient who presented to our unit. She is HIV positive and on antiretroviral treatment. She required an emergency cholecystectomy to relieve external compression of the common bile duct where an empyematous gallbladder was found. Histopathology confirmed the presence of an Epstein-Barr virus-associated smooth muscle tumor. She is noted to have other asymptomatic lesions. Surgical intervention is reserved for symptomatic lesions and improves the immunocompromised state, although there is a propensity for local recurrence of the tumor.
