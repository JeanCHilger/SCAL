Diagnostic imaging of pancreatic metastasis. The authors present their personal series of pancreatic metastases (8 cases) which were evaluated with different imaging modalities--i.e., sonography, computed tomography, and angiography. Possibilities and limitations of non-invasive modalities are pointed out, and the usefulness of angiography is emphasized for the identification of small hypervascular lesions. The fairly rare diagnosis of these tumoral lesions is due to 3 causes: low incidence of pancreatic metastases their frequently small size which justifies eventual false negatives
