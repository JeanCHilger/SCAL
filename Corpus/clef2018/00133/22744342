Incidentally discovered benign pancreatic cystic neoplasms not communicating with the ductal system: MR/MRCP imaging appearance and evolution. The authors sought to determine magnetic resonance/magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MR/MRCP) imaging features of incidentally discovered benign, noncommunicating cystic neoplasms (BNCNs) of the pancreas to assess their evolution over time and identify MR/MRCP imaging features predictive of tumour growth.This was a retrospective study, so informed consent was waived. Sixty-two patients with a diagnosis of BNCN were assessed. Inclusion criteria were incidentally discovered cystic neoplasm of the pancreas with nonmeasurable walls, no mural nodules and no communication with the pancreatic ductal system and who underwent â‰¥ 1 MR/MRCP examination. Image analysis, performed at diagnosis and during follow-up, included macroscopic pattern (microcystic/macrocystic/mixed), number of cysts (unicystic/oligocystic/multicystic), BNCN maximum diameter and tumour growth rates.A total of 64 BNCNs was detected. Macroscopic pattern was mixed in 31/64 (48%), microcystic in 28/64 (44%) and macrocystic in 5/64 (8%). BNCNs appeared multicystic in 38/64 (59%) cases, oligocystic in 22/64 (35%) and unicystic in 4/64(6%). All qualitative parameters remained unchanged during follow-up. At diagnosis, the median maximum BNCN diameter was 35.0 mm and 38.0 mm at the final examination (p<0.001). BNCNs showed a tumour growth rate of 2 mm/year.Mixed and microcystic patterns were the most common, accounting for 48% and 44% of cases, respectively, and showed no change over time. MR/MRCP features predictive of lesion enlargement were a mixed/ macrocystic pattern, and lesion size was >3 cm (both p<0.001).
