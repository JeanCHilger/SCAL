Tuberculosis of the pancreas. A 67-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of intermittent pain in the upper left quadrant of the abdomen. Ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a mass in the body of the pancreas, and angiography demonstrated encasement of the celiac trunk and splenic vein thrombosis. She was thought to have a pancreatic carcinoma and was surgically explored to obtain tissue for diagnosis. A hard and irregular tumor was found, and biopsies revealed granulomatous inflammation with caseous necrosis. The final diagnosis was tuberculosis, and treatment with rifampicin, isoniazid, and ethambutol was undertaken. One year later the patient is asymptomatic and new CT scan shows disappearance of the pancreatic mass.
