The value of dual-source dual-energy CT with iodine overlay in the diagnosis of acute necrotizing pancreatitis. To investigate the clinical value of dual-source computed tomography dual-energy Iodine overlay technique in the imaging diagnosis of acute necrotizing pancreatitis.The imaging data were retrospectively analyzed in 67 cases of acute necrotizing pancreatitis underwent contrast-enhanced dual-source dual-energy CT in portal venous phase. The CT imaging parameters, including the difference of CT value between pancreatic parenchyma and necrotic lesion, contrast-to-noise ratio of pancreatic parenchyma-to-necrosis, area of pancreatic necrosis and score of subjective diagnosis, were measured and assessed on CT images of 80 kV, 140 kV, weighted-average 120 kV as well as Iodine overlay.The differences of CT value between pancreatic parenchyma and necrosis in the images of 80 kV, 140 kV, weighted-average 120 kV and Iodine overlay were (67.40 +/- 20.82) HU, (42.87 +/- 14.99) HU, (48.69 +/- 15.82) HU, (33.01 +/- 10.26) HU, respectively contrast-to-noise ratios of pancreatic parenchyma-to-necrosis of each group were 8.36 +/- 3.58, 5.85 +/- 2.65, 7.68 +/- 3.51, 10.60 4.34
