Duodenal carcinoma from a duodenal diverticulum mimicking pancreatic carcinoma. An 81-year-old man was found to have a pancreatic head tumor on abdominal computed tomography (CT) performed during a follow-up visit for sigmoid colon cancer. The tumor had a diameter of 35mm on the CT scan and was diagnosed as pancreatic head carcinoma T3N0M0. The patient was treated with pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy. Histopathological examination showed that the tumor had grown within a hollow structure, was contiguous with a duodenal diverticulum, and had partially invaded the pancreas. Immunohistochemistry results were as follows:CK7 negative, CK20 positive, CD10 negative, CDX2 positive, MUC1 negative, MUC2 positive, MUC5AC negative, and MUC6 negative. The tumor was diagnosed as duodenal carcinoma from the duodenal diverticulum. Preoperative imaging showed that the tumor was located in the head of the pancreas and was compressing the common bile duct, thus making it appear like pancreatic cancer. To the best of our knowledge, this is the second report of a case of duodenal carcinoma from a duodenal diverticulum mimicking pancreatic carcinoma.
