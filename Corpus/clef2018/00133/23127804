Perfusion CT can predict tumoral grading of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. To describe perfusion CT features of locally advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and to evaluate correlation with tumor grading.Thirty-two patients with locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma were included in this study. Lesions were evaluated by P-CT and biopsy after patient's informed consent. P-CT parameters have been assessed on a large single and on 6 small intratumoral ROIs. Values obtained have been compared and related to the tumor grading using Mann-Whitney U test. Sensibility, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy in predicting tumor grading have been calculated for cut-off values chosen by using ROC curves.Out of 32 lesions, 12 were classified as low grade and 20 as high grade. A statistically significant difference between high and low grade neoplasms were demonstrated for PEI and BV parameters. PEI and BV cut-off values were respectively 17.8 HU and 14.8 ml/100g. PEI identified high grade neoplasms with a 65% sensitivity, 92% specificity, 93% PPV, 61% NPV and 75% accuracy. BV identified high grade neoplasms with a 80% sensitivity, 75% specificity, 84% PPV, 69% NPV, 78% accuracy. Considering both PEI and BV, P-CT identified high grade lesions with a 60% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 100% PPV, 60% NPV and 75% accuracy.PEI and BV perfusion CT parameters proved their efficiency in identifying high grade pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
