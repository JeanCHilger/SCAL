Double pancreatic and gastric adenocarcinomas: a rare association. Synchronous gastric and pancreatic cancers represent a very rare association. The role of tomodensitometry, endoscopic ultrasound and histology is primordial to differentiate between double tumors, local extension or metastasis. We report in our paper two cases of synchronous gastric and pancreatic cancers treated with Folforinox. Then, we discuss the risk factors, the diagnostic methods, the treatment modalities and the prognosis of these rare double cancers.
