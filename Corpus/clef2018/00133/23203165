Pancreatic pseudocyst formation due to non-traumatic pancreatitis in a 3-year-old child. A pancreatic pseudocyst is a localised collection of pancreatic secretions that lacks a true epithelial lining and is walled off by granulation tissue. A rare case of pancreatic pseudocyst formation due to non-traumatic pancreatitis in a 3-year-old boy is described. The child was presented with fever, abdominal pain and vomiting for a period of 5 days. Ultrasonography and CT scan examinations were performed and biochemical and haematological investigations were undertaken. A pancreatic pseudocyst was identified and operatively managed by cystogastrostomy.
