Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas in an old man: age does not matter. Solid pseudopapillary tumor (SPN) of the pancreas is a rare tumor, but has favorable prognosis. It is typically observed in young women. Only few cases have been reported in young men. We report the observation of a 73-year-old man presented with a palpable mass in the left upper abdomen. CT scan showed 10 cm mass at the tail of the pancreas. This mass had mixed cystic and solid components. The patient underwent a distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy. SPN of the pancreas was diagnosed based on histopathological features. The patient recovered uneventfully and didn't receive adjuvant therapy. A CT scan performed 16 months postoperatively showed no evidence of disease recurrence. Although SPN of the pancreas is typically observed in young women, the diagnosis should not be discounted in old male patients. Male patients and those with old age, atypical histopathology and incomplete resection may have a higher risk of recurrence and death, deserving particular attention.
