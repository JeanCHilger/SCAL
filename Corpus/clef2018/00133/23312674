Pancreatic cancer: lack of association between apparent diffusion coefficient values and adverse pathological features. To identify retrospectively potential associations between apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and tumour grade as well as other pathological features, using histopathological assessment from the Whipple procedure as the reference standard.Thirty patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including diffusion-weighted imaging with b-values of 0 and 500 s/mm(2) before the Whipple procedure. Two radiologists independently recorded the ADC values of the tumour and benign pancreas for all cases. ADC values were compared with histopathological findings following the Whipple procedure.The intra-class correlation coefficient was 0.689 for benign pancreas and 0.695 for tumours, indicating good inter-reader agreement for ADC values. The mean ADC value was significantly lower in tumours than in benign pancreas for both readers (reader 1: 1.74 ± 0.34 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s versus 2.08 ± 0.48 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s, respectively, p = 0.006 reader 2: 1.69 ± 0.41 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s versus 2.11 ± 0.54 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s, respectively, p < 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in mean ADC between poorly and well/moderately differentiated tumours for either reader (reader 1: 1.69 ± 0.36 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s versus 1.78 ± 0.33 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s, respectively, p = 0.491No associations between ADC values of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and tumour grade or other adverse pathological features were observed.
