Multiple metastatic leiomyosarcoma of the pancreas: a first case report and review of the literature. A 60-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with swelling of the right leg. After surgery, leiomyosarcoma of the right leg was diagnosed. Computed tomography showed two hypovascular masses in the pancreatic body and tail that were heterogeneously enhanced compared with the pancreatic parenchyma. On endoscopic ultrasonography, the tumors in the pancreatic body and tail both exhibited regular margins and were visualized as well-circumscribed masses with uneven interiors. Distal pancreatectomy was performed under a presumptive diagnosis of metastatic pancreatic leiomyosarcoma diagnosed based on the findings of EUS-FNA. On laparotomy, peritoneal washing cytology yielded negative results, and no dissemination was observed. Ultimately, metastatic pancreatic leiomyosarcoma was histologically diagnosed.
