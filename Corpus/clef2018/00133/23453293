A novel flexible cryoprobe for EUS-guided pancreatic biopsies. EUS-guided FNA (EUS-FNA) is an established technique for the cytologic diagnosis of pancreatic disease. Attempts to obtain adequate histologic specimens have yielded variable and mostly insufficient results.To evaluate the safety, feasibility, and quality of histologic biopsy specimens obtained by using a new cryobiopsy probe and to compare them with standard EUS-FNA and (laparoscopic) trucut biopsy specimens of pancreatic tissue.Animal non-survival study.Eighty-four pancreatic biopsy specimens (12 per group) were obtained in 4 anesthetized pigs by using one of the following the 18-gauge flexible cryoprobe a conventional, 19-gauge, EUS-FNA needleSpecimens were evaluated for artifacts and specimen quality by a blinded pathologist who used a 7-point Likert scale to assess histologic adequacy. Biopsy size and bleeding time after biopsy also were recorded.The new cryoprobe was equivalent to the rigid, trucut needle and superior (P < .001) to the conventional 19-gauge FNA needles with respect to artifacts, quality of the specimen, biopsy specimen size, and bleeding.Animal model.EUS-guided cryobiopsy was associated with better specimen quality for histologic analysis and a shorter bleeding time compared with a conventional 19-gauge FNA needle in the animal model. It is a promising new technique for histologic examination of pancreatic tissue.
