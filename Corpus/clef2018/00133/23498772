Interest of intraoperative ultrasonography during pancreatectomy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Isolated pancreatic metastases from renal cell carcinoma may be treated by surgical resection in a curative intent. As they are frequently multiple, a good imaging workup is mandatory to plan the appropriate resection. The aim of this study was to define the imaging workup that should be performed in this setting.We reviewed all patients who underwent pancreatic resection for metastasis of renal cell carcinoma in a single centre during a 20-year period. The results of the intraoperative ultrasonography were compared to those of the preoperative imaging and the final pathology results.Thirteen patients were studied. A CT scan was always performed whereas only three patients had a MRI (only one revealed another tumor). Intraoperative ultrasonography found new tumors in 50% of patients when it was performed (4/8) and modified the management in 40% of them, while preoperative PET scan was useless.Intraoperative ultrasonography is a low-cost and non-invasive technique that should be routinely included in the surgical exploration of pancreatic metastases from renal carcinoma.
