A giant adrenal pseudocyst mimicking an adrenal cancer: case report and review of the literature. Adrenal pseudocysts are rare lesions that develop within the adrenal glands, generally from vessel ectasia or from degenerative adenomas or hematomas. They are usually non-functional and asymptomatic. The reported potential malignant transformation of an adrenal cyst is ca. 7% and indicates radical excision of these masses. We report the case of a 69-year-old man with hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and obesity in whom microscopic hematuria was detected during a routine examination performed by his family doctor. To investigate the cause of this microscopic hematuria, the patient underwent computed tomography of the abdomen, which showed a well-defined 12-cm lesion of the left adrenal gland with calcification and necrotic components that was compressing the left kidney, pancreas, and spleen. Suspecting adrenal carcinoma, after preoperative staging, a left subcostal laparotomy was performed, with resection of the left adrenal gland, a splenectomy, and resection of the pancreatic tail. The histology showed an adrenal pseudocyst with a fibrous capsule containing amorphous eosinophilic material with calcification and cholesterol crystals. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged 12 days after surgery.
