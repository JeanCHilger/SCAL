Parallel imaging improves the image quality and duct visibility of breathhold two-dimensional thick-slab MR cholangiopancreatography. To evaluate the effect of parallel imaging (PI) with different acceleration factors on the image quality and duct visibility of breathhold two-dimensional (2D) thick-slab single-shot turbo spin-echo (SSTSE) MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) images.Breathhold 2D thick-slab SSTSE MRCP was performed three times, i.e., without PI, with PI factor 2, and with PI factor 3, at 1.5 Tesla (T) for each of 85 patients. Two, independent readers evaluated the image quality and the visibility of five duct segments and ranked their preference of the three MRCP sequences. The data were analyzed using the repeated-measures analysis of variance test, the Friedman test, and the linear-by-linear chi-square test.MRCP sequences with PI factor 2 or 3 generated better image quality (P < 0.001) and an improved duct visibility for all duct segments (P ≤ 0.01), while no significant difference was noted between the MRCP sequences with PI factor 2 and PI factor 3 (P > 0.05). Among the three sequences, both readers most often preferred the MRCP with PI factor 3, followed by the MRCP with PI factor 2 (P < 0.001).The application of PI improves the image quality and duct visibility in breathhold 2D thick-slab SSTSE MRCP.
