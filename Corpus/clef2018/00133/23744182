Imaging features of pancreatic tumors in children: 13-year experience at a pediatric tertiary hospital. Pancreatic tumors are rare in children, resulting in limited information regarding their frequency and imaging appearances.To review all pancreatic tumors seen in children over a decade at a large tertiary pediatric institution and to describe multimodality imaging findings.We conducted a retrospective review of imaging studies performed in children with pancreatic tumors between January 2000 and December 2012, analyzing imaging features on available US, CT and MR examinations. We reviewed patient charts for clinical features, management and final diagnosis.We included 23 children in this study. Of these, 12 had solid and papillary epithelial neoplasms (SPEN), 3 had neuroendocrine tumors, 3 had lymphoma, and 1 each had hemangioendothelioma, benign congenital cysts with adipose tissue, dendritic cell sarcoma, metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma, and lipoma. All children with SPEN were teenage girls. SPEN showed characteristic imaging features including well-defined margins with surrounding capsule, solid-cystic components and hemorrhage.Pancreatic tumors are uncommon in children. SPEN is the most common tumor and is seen predominantly in teenage girls and shows characteristic imaging features.
