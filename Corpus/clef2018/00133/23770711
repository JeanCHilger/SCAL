Three-dimensional contrast-enhanced ultrasonography of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas: a comparison with magnetic resonance imaging. The objective of this study was to prospectively compare the diagnostic accuracy of 3-dimensional contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (3D-CEUS) with that of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the study of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas.Thirty consecutive patients with IPMN were studied.Three patients (10.0%) did not undergo diagnostic 3D-CEUS because of technical problems. Three dimensional CEUS identified 12 (44.4%) main-duct IPMNs versus no cases by MRI (P < 0.001). Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm localization showed poor agreement between 3D-CEUS and MRI (κ = 0.058), whereas good agreement was found in detecting the pancreatic calcifications (κ = 1.000). Significant differences between 3D-CEUS and MRI were found regarding the number of lesions detected (1.4 ± 0.8 vs 3.8 ± 3.6 P < 0.001), the detection of mucinous plugs (3.7% vs 50.0%Even if MRI remains the criterion standard technique for the diagnosis of IPMNs, 3D-CEUS can be safely used to follow patients with IPMNs of less than 1 cm.
