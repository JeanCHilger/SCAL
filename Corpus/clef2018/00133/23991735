Pancreatoblastoma: a rare, adult pancreatic tumor with many faces. Pancreatoblastomas are malignant epithelial neoplasms of the pancreas that are heterogeneous and have variable cellular differentiation, complicating the diagnosis. We report a case of pancreatoblastoma occurring in an adult patient, presenting as a pancreatic head mass with liver metastasis and jaundice. The initial liver biopsy diagnosis was metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma based on morphology and synaptophysin positivity. At pancreatic resection, the diagnostic features of pancreatoblastoma were recognized. We review the radiologic and pathologic differential diagnosis, histologic heterogeneity, clinical presentation, and associated genetic syndromes for this unusual tumor that can mimic other types of pancreatic neoplasia.
