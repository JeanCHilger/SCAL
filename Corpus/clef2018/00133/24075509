Acute pancreatitis associated with molecular targeted therapies: a retrospective review of the clinico-radiological features, management and outcome. To study the presentation, radiological features, management and outcome of acute pancreatitis detected on imaging in patients receiving molecular targeted therapy (MTT).In this IRB-approved, HIPAA-compliant retrospective study, search of the radiology database from January 2005 through September 2012 revealed 91 cancer patients with radiologic evidence of acute pancreatitis. Of these, 15 patients receiving MTT (7 women, 8 men mean age 59 years, range 25-84 years) and fulfilling the criteria of acute pancreatitis without any confounding factors were included. Imaging at initial diagnosis of pancreatitis and subsequently were reviewed by three radiologists in consensusEleven patients had focal and four had diffuse pancreatitis. The tail of the pancreas (n = 6) was the most common site of focal pancreatitis. Of the 14/15 patients who underwent CT, modified CT severity index was 2 in 12 patients and 4 in 2 patients. One patient (1/15) who underwent only FDG-PET/CT showed focal pancreatitis. None of the patients had pancreatic necrosis or peripancreatic collections. Findings resolved in all the patients after discontinuation of MTT, except in one patient who died of progressive disease. No radiological or surgical interventions were required in any of the patients. Findings recurred in 4/9 patients (44%) in whom MTT was restarted.MTT-associated pancreatitis is usually mild, focal, and managed conservatively with discontinuation of MTT. The imaging findings are subtle and in our study, pancreatitis recurred in 44% of patients after restarting MTT.
