Fatal clinical outcome in a patient with sarcoidosis-lymphoma syndrome. A 62-year-old female suspected of malignant disease underwent a splenectomy that revealed noncaseating granulomas in the histological specimen. Chest X-ray (CXR) and lung CT scans suggested sarcoidosis stage II. TBLB showed noncaseating granulomas. A diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made. Initially no treatment was needed as partial remission on CXR and normal lung function were observed. During the follow up she underwent open lung biopsy and axillary lymph node biopsy because of radiological progression with presence of CXR opacities imitating metastases and recurrent lymphadenopathy. No malignant cells were found. Spontaneous partial resolution of disseminated changes on the CXR was observed. Because of progressive deterioration in lung function and the clinical course of the disease strongly suggesting the progression of systemic sarcoidosis, the patient was given steroid treatment, which initially resulted in partial remission of pulmonary disseminated changes, peripheral lymphadenopathy and improvement in lung function test. Eight months later severe deterioration in general condition, anaemia, leukocytosis, hypoxemia, massive hepatomegaly and recurrence of general lymphadenopathy along with progression of disseminated changes were found. She died before the final diagnosis was established. Post-mortem examination showed a nodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma with monocytoid B-cells, according to WHO classification. The malignant cells were found in the jugular, mediastinal, paratracheal, paragastric, paraintestinal and retroperitoneal lymph nodes and they infiltrated the lungs, pleura, liver, thyroid gland and pancreas. No sarcoid granulomas were found in the autopsy.
