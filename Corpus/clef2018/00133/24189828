Recurrent acute pancreatitis due to arteriovenous malformation of the pancreas. A 46-year-old man presented with acute epigastric pain and was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. Although successfully managed, it recurred shortly after he was subsequently referred to our institute for further investigation. Dynamic computed tomography (CT) and endoscopic ultrasonography revealed an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in the body and tail of the pancreas. A diagnosis of pancreatic AVM causing recurrent pancreatitis was made and distal pancreatectomy was performed. Follow-up CT after surgery confirmed no further recurrence of either the AVM or pancreatitis. AVM of the pancreas is rare, and surgical resection is necessary in symptomatic patients.
