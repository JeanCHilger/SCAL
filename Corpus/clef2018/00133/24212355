Endoscopic ultrasound-guided radiation therapy in pancreatic cancer. During the last two decades, endoscopic ultrasound has revolutionized the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies. The role of EUS has expanded well beyond its role as a diagnostic modality, and has emerged as a highly sophisticated interventional modality. More recently, EUS has paved its way into radiation oncology by either facilitating highly targeted image guided radiotherapy (IGRT) by insertion of fiducial markers in tumors or by direct instillation of radioactive seeds (brachytherapy). Although the experience regarding these techniques is in a preliminary stage, if developed further, this can potentially provide a highly accurate and minimally invasive approach for implantation of fiducial and radioactive seeds. This review will discuss potential role of EUS in implantation therapy, current literature and also speculate on future prospects for these EUS-guided interventions in pancreatic cancer.
