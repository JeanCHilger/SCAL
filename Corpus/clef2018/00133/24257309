Diagnosis and treatment of 51 patients with pancreatic islet cell tumors. To investigate the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic islet cell tumors.Fifty-one patients with islet cell tumors treated in our department from January 1991 to April 2011 were included in this study. The data of clinical features, diagnosis and treatment were retrospectively analyzed.Among the 51 cases, 38 cases showed typical Whipple's triad, and the other 13 cases were non-functional islet cell tumors. In these 13 cases, 5 patients had no specific clinical symptoms, and 8 patients had abdominal distending pain. The positive rates of imaging were: B-ultrasound 43.1%, multi-slice spiral CT 69.8% MRI 62.5%, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) 64.7% (11/17), and intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) 96.3%, the differences among them were statistically significant (P<0.05). All patients underwent surgical treatment. Postoperative pancreatic leakage happened in 6 cases. Finally all the patients recovered after effective external drainage, anti-infection treatment and nutritional support.Intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUS) has a higher accuracy in the diagnosis of pancreatic islet cell tumors, compared with preoperative B-ultrasonography, CT, MRI, and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). The most effective treatment of this disease is surgery.
