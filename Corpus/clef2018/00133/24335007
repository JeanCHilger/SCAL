Prednisolone markedly reduced serum IgG4 levels along with the improvement of pituitary mass and anterior pituitary function in a patient with IgG4-related infundibulo-hypophysitis. In 2011 a 76 year-old man with a medical history of diabetes, hypertension and autoimmune pancreatitis was admitted to our hospital because of anorexia, general malaise and repeated hypoglycemia. When he was 72 years old, he suffered from pancreatitis, and pancreas head tumor was operated. IgG4-related pancreatitis was diagnosed histopathologically. On admission anterior pituitary function test revealed impaired response of ACTH and cortisol to CRH, and no response of GH, TSH and gonadotropin to GHRH, TRH and LHRH, respectively. Baseline PRL level was elevated. Serum IgG and IgG4 levels were markedly elevated. Pituitary MRI showed significant enlargement of pituitary gland and stalk. Chest CT suggested IgG4-related lung disease. IgG4-related infundibulo-hypophysitis was diagnosed based on the above mentioned past history and results of present examinations. Twenty mg of hydrocortisone, followed by 20 mg of prednisolone (PSL) and 25 Î¼g of levothyroxine markedly reduced serum IgG4 levels and ameliorated the symptom, the size of pituitary and stalk, and anterior pituitary function (TSH, GH and gonadotropin), although diabetes insipidus became apparent due to glucocorticoid administration. This is a typical case of IgG4-related hypophysitis in which PSL causes marked improvement of pituitary mass and pituitary function along with the reduction of serum IgG4 levels.
