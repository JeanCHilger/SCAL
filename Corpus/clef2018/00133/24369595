Chairman's introductory remarks. The practice of EUS-FNA was discussed, with a focus on the sample preparation. Differential diagnosis between benign atypia and well differentiated adenocarcinoma by EUS-FNA cytology was also discussed. The irregular arrangement of cells, irregular shape of nuclei, and abnormal chromatin are the characteristic cytological features of well differentiated adenocarcinoma. Good collaboration among endoscopists, pathologists, and cytotechnologists is important for improving diagnostic accuracy. Performance of EUS-FNA for small pancreatic lesions less than 1 cm in diameter may contribute to early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.
