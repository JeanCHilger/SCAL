Present status of EUS-FNA. Performance of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) has been prevalent mainly in Europe and the Unites States in the past 20 years. By using this technique, we are able to obtain cytologic and histologic material, which are difficult to obtain without laparotomy and are important in determining the therapeutic strategy for lesions. Rapid on-site cytopathological evaluation (ROSE) provides a highly reliable diagnosis. The diagnostic yield of EUS-FNA with ROSE in most studies exceeds 90% however, similarly favorable results without ROSE have been reported from selected studies. These results may not apply to all situations and should be interpreted in the light of specific clinical situations and resource availability. Further controlled clinical studies may be needed to clarify the technical issues related to maximizing the diagnostic yield of EUS-FNA.
