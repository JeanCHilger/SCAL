Long-term survival of a patient with locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer treated with gemcitabine after chemoradiation therapy. We report a case of long-term survival of a patient with locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer treated with gemcitabine after chemoradiation therapy( CRTx). A 61-year-old woman was diagnosed as having locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer, 3.0 cm in diameter, which had invaded the superior mesenteric artery by computed tomography (CT). She was treated with CRTx( gemcitabine[ GEM] at 250 mg/m2/week for 6 weeks+liniac irradiation of 50.2 Gy) followed by systemic chemotherapy (gemcitabine (GEM) at 1,000 mg/m2). Reassessment after CRTx yielded a diagnosis of stable disease (according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1). To date, the patient has undergone 57 courses of chemotherapy in the outpatient clinic however, she did require biliary stent placement because of occlusive jaundice.
