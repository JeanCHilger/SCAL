A case of massive pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma successfully treated with surgical resection and postoperative everolimus administration. A 55-year-old woman presented to our hospital with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a massive tumor originating from the tail of the pancreas, with liver and lymph node metastasis. Percutaneous biopsy was performed and yielded a diagnosis of pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma. The patient underwent distal pancreatectomy, lateral segmentectomy of the liver, para-aortic lymph node dissection, and cytoreductive surgery for treatment of peritoneal dissemination. Octreotide was administered on post-operative day (POD) 3. Treatment with everolimus (10 mg/day) was initiated on POD 32. Stable disease according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors( RECIST) was observed for 4 months, and the patient survived for a total of 9 months after surgery. Everolimus was tolerated safely and was effective for the treatment of pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma.
