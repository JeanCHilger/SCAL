A case of metachronous pancreatic cancer that developed 4 years after initial pancreatectomy. A 55-year-old woman underwent subtotal stomach-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma( PDAC) in July 2008. The final diagnosis was Stage I PDAC according to the Union for International Cancer Control( UICC) TNM classification. After the operation, adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine was administered for 6 months. The tumor marker level increased at 49 months after the operation, and 18-fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography( PET) showed FDG accumulation in the remnant pancreas. A hypovascular tumor was revealed in the remnant pancreas on computed tomography( CT). As PDAC was diagnosed without distant metastasis, completion pancreatectomy was performed. Histopathological investigation revealed PDAC with invasion into the muscularis propria of the anastomosed jejunum and splenic plexus. The final diagnosis was T3N0M0 UICC Stage IIA metachronous PDAC. The postoperative course was uneventful. However, multiple liver metastases and local recurrence were detected on CT 2 months after resection, and the patient died 3 months after resection. Most reported cases of metachronous PDACs were diagnosed at an advanced stage despite regular follow-ups after the initial resection. Further investigation is needed to determine the adequate surveillance time and novel therapeutic strategies.
