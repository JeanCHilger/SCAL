A case of partial pancreatectomy for recurrent metastatic renal cell carcinoma in the remnant pancreas after subtotal stomach-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy. We report a case in which recurrent pancreatic metastasis of renal cell carcinoma( RCC) in the remnant pancreas was resected 6 years after subtotal stomach-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (SSPPD). A 74-year-old man underwent right nephrectomy for RCC in 1991, left partial nephrectomy for left renal RCC metastasis in 1996, and SSPPD for pancreatic RCC metastasis in 2007. In November 2012, he was referred to our hospital with a tumor in the remnant pancreas, as seen on abdominal computed tomography (CT). Partial pancreatectomy for the recurrent metastatic RCC in the remnant pancreas was performed in January 2013. The tumor was histologically diagnosed as metastasis from clear cell RCC in the remnant pancreas. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the blood glucose level after surgery was well controlled using an oral hypoglycemic agent.
