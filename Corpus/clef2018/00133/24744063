Solid pseudopapillary tumour of pancreas. Solid pseudopapillary tumour of the pancreas is a rare neoplasm (1%). This tumour primarily affects young women and is usually treated with surgical resection with a relatively favourable prognosis. We report an 18-year-old female patient presenting with moderate grade abdominal pain for 5 weeks. Abdominal examination revealed a lump palpable in the right upper abdomen. Contrast-enhanced CT abdomen reported soft tissue lesion arising from uncinate process of pancreas causing adjacent compression. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy yielded a cellular sample comprising pseudopapillary arrangement with bland appearing tumour cells consistent with benign neoplasm. And because of unusual location, Whipple procedure was performed. The patient was discharged under satisfactory conditions. Final histology confirmed the diagnosis. Solid pseudopapillary tumours of the pancreas are a rare but treatable pancreatic tumour. Complete surgical excision is the treatment of choice and can be achieved through an open or minimal access technique.
