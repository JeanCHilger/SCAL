68Ga DOTANOC PET/CT detects primary malignant insulinoma. Malignant insulinoma is an extremely rare pancreatic tumor variant characterized by an aggressive clinical behavior with local and distant spread. Delays in the diagnosis are common because symptoms usually precede tumor detection and may be misattributed. Aggressive surgical resection is the primary treatment option therefore accurate tumor localization is important for appropriate management. Although somatostatin receptor imaging has a limited role in the visualization of benign insulinoma (characterized by a low expression of somatostatin receptors), it can still have a role in the detection of malignant forms.
