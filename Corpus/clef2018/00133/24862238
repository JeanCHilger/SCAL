(68)Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT in the evaluation of patients with neuroendocrine metastatic carcinoma of unknown origin. There is little evidence regarding the role of (68)Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT for the identification of primary tumors in patients with metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma of unknown primary. The aim of this study is to assess the value of this technique in the mentioned clinical scenario.We retrospectively studied twenty-nine patients (mean age 59.5 ± 10.6 years female 17) with pathologically proven neuroendocrine metastases. In all cases conventional imaging was negative for primary tumor identification. (68)Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT was performed with a mean dose of 104.2 ± 18.8 MBq, using a 64-slice PET/CT with time-of-flight correction. A team of an experienced radiologist and a nuclear medicine physician evaluated the images. The maximum SUV (SUVm) was measured in all abnormal foci. Histopathology (when available) and/or clinical follow-up with correlative imaging was considered as reference standard.(68)Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT identified the primary tumor in 17/29 (59%) patients in the following locations: pancreas (n = 7), ileum (n = 7), duodenum (n = 1), colon (n = 1) and stomach (n = 1). In this population a significant correlation was found between SUVm of primary tumor and metastases (r = 0.815, P < 0.0001). Furthermore, additional sites of unsuspected metastases were demonstrated in 9 patients of this group and in 6 patients in whom no primary tumor was localized, mainly in lymph nodes and mesentery. Pathology confirmation was obtained in 7 patients who underwent surgery, whereas in the remaining 10 patients, correlative imaging and follow-up confirmed primary tumor localization.(68)Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT is a clinically useful imaging technique for the localization of primary tumors in patients with neuroendocrine metastatic carcinoma of unknown origin with the potential of having a significant impact in patient management and therapy planning.
