Ultrasound-guided endoscopic fine needle aspiration cytology in pancreatic lesions: a series of 43 cases with histologic correlation from a single institution. To describe the usefulness of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology (EUS-FNAC) in pancreatic lesions.During a 5-year period (2007-2011) a total of 391 patients with pancreatic lesions have been studied using EUS-FNAC, with 43 of them having cytohistological correlation with core biopsy or surgical specimens. The diagnostic performance of this technique with and without the pathologist in the endoscopy room has been compared.On the cytological smears, adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in 13 (30.2%) cases and neuroendocrine neoplasm in 2 (4.6%). Six (13.9%) cases were considered suspicious for malignancy, 2 (4.6%) were solid pseudopapillary tumors, and 20 (46.5%) were negative. There were no mucin-producing cystic neoplasms in the cytological diagnostic approach. After the cytohistological correlation, 23 (53.5%) cases were true positive, 11 (25.5%) were true negative, and 9 (21%) were false negative. There were no false positive cases in the series. Diagnostic precision was 79%, sensitivity 71.18%, specificity 100%, positive predictive value 100%, and negative predictive value 55%. The diagnostic performance of this technique is significantly higher (p < 0.015) when the pathologist is present in the endoscopy room.Our data support the usefulness and reliability of EUS-FNAC in the diagnosis of pancreatic lesions. In our experience, significantly better results are obtained when the pathologist takes an active part in the procedure.
