Pilot study: Evaluation of dual-energy computed tomography measurement strategies for positron emission tomography correlation in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. We sought to determine whether dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) measurements correlate with positron emission tomography (PET) standardized uptake values (SUVs) in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and to determine the optimal DECT imaging variables and modeling strategy to produce the highest correlation with maximum SUV (SUVmax). We reviewed 25 patients with unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma seen at Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, Arizona, who had PET-computed tomography (PET/CT) and enhanced DECT performed the same week between March 25, 2010 and December 9, 2011. For each examination, DECT measurements were taken using one of three methods: (1) average values of three tumor regions of interest (ROIs) (method 1) (2) one ROI in the area of highest subjective DECT enhancement (method 2)
