Surgical transgastric debridement of walled off pancreatic necrosis: an option for patients with necrotizing pancreatitis. Transgastric debridement of walled off pancreatic necrosis (WOPN) is a surgical treatment option for patients requiring pancreatic debridement for necrotizing pancreatitis. The reported experience with surgical transgastric pancreatic debridement is limited, however, the lower incidence of postoperative pancreatic fistulae with this procedure compared to other options warrants further evaluation of this technique.Retrospective chart review.Twenty-two patients underwent transgastric debridement with a cystogastrostomy for clinically symptomatic WOPN from January 1, 2005 to July 31, 2013. Eight cases were performed laparoscopically and 14 were performed by an open approach. The mean patient age was 50.9 (50.9 Â± 14.5) and the median American Society of Anesthesiologist score was 3. The most common etiology for pancreatitis was gallstones and the median time from attack of pancreatitis to definitive surgical management was 60 days (range 22-300 days). Median operative time was 182 min (range 85-327 min) with 100 cc (range 20-500 cc) of blood loss. In seven patients the necrosis was infected and in 15 patients the necrosis was sterile as determined by the intraoperative culture of the necrotic material. The overall significant morbidity (Clavien type 3 or greater) was 13.6 % and the mortality was 0 %. The incidence of postoperative pancreatic fistula was 0 %. 20 patients (90 %) were symptom free during a median follow-up of 12 months.In selected patients with clinically symptomatic WOPN, surgical transgastric pancreatic debridement appears to be a safe procedure with a low morbidity and mortality. The low incidence of postoperative pancreatic fistulae warrants further evaluation.
