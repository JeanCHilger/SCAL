Gangliocytic paraganglioma, a rare ampullary tumour treated with open transduodenal resection and sphincteroplasty. Gangliocytic paragangliomas are rare neuroendocrine tumours residing in the gastrointestinal tract, most commonly the periampullary region. Most are benign tumours with a low malignancy rate. We report a 50-year-old man who presented with acute onset of left-upper quadrant abdominal pain with radiation to the back. An intraluminal mass at the junction of the duodenum with normal pancreatic/hepatic parenchyma was discovered on abdominal CT. Following upper endoscopy and MRI revealing a periampullary lesion, fine-needle aspiration and biopsies were. Immunohistochemistry was positive for synaptophysin and S100HU, consistent with gangliocytic paraganglioma. The benign nature of this tumour and unique anatomy of a separate opening of the pancreatic and common bile ducts led to transduodenal excision with sphincteroplasty, thereby avoiding extensive surgery. Surveillance CT every 6 months and upper endoscopy initially every 6 months (now yearly) revealed no evidence of endoscopic or histological recurrence at 3 years follow-up.
