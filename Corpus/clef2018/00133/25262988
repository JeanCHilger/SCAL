Multimodality imaging of pancreatic arteriovenous malformation. Arteriovenous malformation of the pancreas (PAVM) is a very rare entity, although it may be increasingly diagnosed with the expanding use of cross-sectional imaging of the abdomen. PAVM is characterized by a network of tangled vasculature within and surrounding all or part of the pancreas, resulting in the shunting of the arteries of the pancreas directly into the portal venous system. Here, we present a patient with chronic abdominal pain and pancreatitis found to have PAVM, based on the findings of computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and angiography. Differential considerations are discussed. Although PAVM is uncommon, it should be considered in the differential of patients with recurrent abdominal pain or gastrointestinal bleeding.
