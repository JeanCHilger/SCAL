Correlation between apparent diffusion coefficients on diffusion-weighted MRI and standardized uptake value on FDG-PET/CT in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) and 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is increasingly recognized as important for assessing tumor malignancy in oncology. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and standardized uptake value (SUV) are negatively correlated in some types of cancer based on tumor aggressiveness.To evaluate relationships between ADC of magnetic resonance imaging and SUV of PET/CT in pancreatic adenocarcinomas.Twenty-nine patients histopathologically diagnosed with pancreatic adenocarcinomas were evaluated. ADC maps were generated from 3 T-MRI using b values (b = 0, 800 s/mm(2)). PET/CT was performed 60 min after intravenous injection of FDG (3.7 MBq/kg). The margins of tumors on DW-MRI and PET/CT were assessed to measure ADC and SUV of tumor appropriately. For tumors considered well-marginated, minimal and mean ADC as well as maximal and mean SUV were measured. The correlation of ADC and SUV were statistically evaluated and survival period stratified on ADC and SUV also evaluated.Twenty-two tumors on DW-MRI and 25 on PET/CT were deemed well-marginated. Minimal ADC was significantly and negatively correlated with maximal and mean SUV (r = -0.61, P = 0.0040 r = -0.66, P = 0.0015), and mean ADC also showed significantly and negatively correlation with maximal and mean SUV (r = -0.50, P = 0.024ADC and SUV were significantly correlated in pancreatic adenocarcinomas, although no significant findings were observed in overall survival.
