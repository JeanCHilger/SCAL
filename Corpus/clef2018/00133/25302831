Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas: evaluation of malignant potential and surgical resectability by using MR imaging with MR cholangiography. To evaluate the diagnostic performance of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) in determining the malignant potential and surgical resectability of pancreas intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs).Institutional review board approval was obtained, and the requirement for informed consent was waived. Ninety-eight patients with pathologically proved pancreas IPMNs who underwent MR imaging with MRCP comprised the study population. MR images were analyzed for findings suggestive of high-risk stigmata or worrisome features, as proposed by the international consensus guidelines 2012. Interobserver agreement between two experienced observers (observers 1 and 2) and one inexperienced observer (observer 3) was assessed. Diagnostic performance of MR imaging in the evaluation of the malignant potential and surgical resectability of IPMNs was analyzed in these three observers by using receiver operating curve analysis.MR imaging with MRCP showed sensitivity of 83% (35/42), 79% (33/42), and 90% (38/42) specificity of 80% (41/51), 51% (26/51), and 24% (12/51)MR imaging with MRCP is a useful modality in the evaluation of the malignant potential and resectability of IPMNs, with high sensitivity and moderate specificity in the experienced radiologists but relatively low specificity in the inexperienced radiology trainee.
