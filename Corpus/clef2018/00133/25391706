A case of nonfunctioning pancreatic endocrine tumor with atypical imaging findings due to prominent fibrosis of the tumor stroma. The patient, a 56-year-old woman, was found during routine checkup to have a disorder of hepatic function. Abdominal ultrasonography showed an ill-defined hypoechoic mass in the head and body of the pancreas however, no blood-flow signal was observed within the tumor on Doppler ultrasonography. Abdominal computed tomography showed a low-density area in the arterial and portal venous phases. The lesion was visualized as an area of low signal intensity on both T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images, whereas fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography showed fluorodeoxyglucose accumulation in the tumor. Although a preoperative diagnosis was difficult to make, a rapid cytologic examination revealed evidence of a pancreatic endocrine tumor, and subtotal stomach-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy with portal vein resection was performed. Histopathological examination showed tumor cell nests scattered in abundant fibrotic tissue
