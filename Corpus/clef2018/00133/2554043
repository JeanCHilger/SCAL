A case of hepatoblastoma occurring in an adult. We present herein a rare case of hepatoblastoma occurring in an adult male. The patient was 22 years old and his laboratory investigations on admission showed a marked elevation of alpha-fetoprotein in the serum. CT scan and other examinations revealed a primary tumor, 6.5 cm in size, in the left hepatic lobe with metastasis in the head of the pancreas. Thus left hepatic lobectomy and pancreaticoduodenectomy were performed, but metastasis to the right hepatic lobe, left lung and abdominal skin were found 2 months later. Despite repeated courses of chemotherapy with adriamycin and cisplatin, the patient died 9 months after his operation. Pathological findings revealed poorly differentiated type hepatoblastoma. A review of the literature revealed only twelve other such cases.
