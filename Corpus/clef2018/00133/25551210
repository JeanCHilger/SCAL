Endoscopic ultrasound-guided endotherapy. Over the last 2 decades, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has evolved from a noninvasive diagnostic tool to a combined diagnostic and therapeutic modality. The use of EUS complementary to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has made possible biliary and pancreatic drainage in situations where conventional ERCP is unsuccessful or unlikely to be feasible. The degree of proximity to the pancreas achieved during the procedure has enabled therapeutic interventions such as drainage of peripancreatic fluid collections, pancreatic cyst ablation, and pancreatic cancer therapy. Real-time visualization of flow in adjacent blood vessels using Doppler ultrasound has allowed endovascular therapy for ablation of gastric varices and feeding vessels. Furthermore, the role of EUS is evolving in a multitude of applications such as bilioenteric and enteroenteric anastomosis in a minimally invasive manner, potentially reducing the need for surgery. This article reviews the role of EUS as an alternative to surgery in selective situations and provides an overview of future directions and evolving uses of EUS.
