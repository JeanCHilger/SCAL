Accuracy of routine multidetector computed tomography to identify arterial variants in patients scheduled for pancreaticoduodenectomy. To assess the efficacy of cross-sectional multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) imaging without arterial reconstruction to identify aberrant right hepatic artery (RHA) and celiac artery stenosis (CAS) in patients scheduled for pancreaticoduodenectomy.Patients with peri-ampullary and pancreatic head tumors who underwent routine preoperative MDCT and subsequent computed tomography (CT) angiography (CTA), conventional angiography or pancreaticoduodenectomy between September 2007 and August 2013 were identified. Retrospective analysis of imaging data was undertaken using CTA, conventional angiographic and surgical findings as the reference standards. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of MDCT in evaluation of aberrant RHA and CAS were calculated.A group of 458 patients met the inclusion criteria of this study to detect aberrant RHA, and 181 cases were included to identify CAS. Fifty-four (11.8%) patients were confirmed to have aberrant RHA, while 12 (6.6%) patients with CAS were demonstrated. MDCT yielded an accuracy of 98.5%, sensitivity of 96.3% and specificity of 98.8% in the detection of aberrant RHA. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of MDCT for detecting CAS were 58.3%, 98.2%, 70% and 97.1%, respectively.Routine MDCT is recommended such that surgeons and radiologists be alerted to the importance of arterial variants on preoperative CT scans in patients scheduled for pancreaticoduodenectomy.
