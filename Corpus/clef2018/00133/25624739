Pancreatic mass as an initial manifestation of polyarteritis nodosa: a case report and review of the literature. Classic polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) that targets medium-sized muscular arteries and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), characterized by inflammation of small-caliber vessels and the presence of circulating myeloperoxidase anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (MPO-ANCA), are distinct clinicopathological entities of systemic vasculitis. A 66-year-old woman presented with fever, cholestasis and positive MPO-ANCA. Radiological examination showed a pancreatic mass compressing the bile duct. Therefore, we performed pancreatoduodenectomy. Histopathological examination revealed that necrotizing vasculitis predominantly affecting the medium-sized vessels, spared arterioles or capillaries in the pancreas, a finding consistent with PAN. Unexpectedly, renal biopsy revealed small-caliber vasculitis and glomerulonephritis, supporting MPA. The initial manifestation of a pancreatic mass associated with vasculitis has only been reported in 7 articles. Its diagnosis is challenging because no reliable clinico-radiological findings have been observed. Clinicians should be aware of such cases and early diagnosis followed by immunosuppression is mandatory. Our findings may reflect a polyangiitis overlap syndrome coexisting between pancreatic PAN and renal MPA.
