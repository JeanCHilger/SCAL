Spleen preservation in a caudal pancreatic serous cystadenoma - case report. Cystic lesions of the pancreas are relatively rare entities but have been increasingly diagnosed in recent years due to advanced imaging techniques. This category encompasses pancreatic pseudocyst as well as a wide range of pancreatic tumors with benign behavior, borderline or primary malignant. Serous cystadenoma of the pancreas represents the most common benign pancreatic tumor, with a very low but well recognized malignant potential. The clinical presentation varies according to its size small tumors may be asymptomatic and discovered incidentally, while large tumors are more likely symptomatic. We report the case of a female patient presenting with non-specific left abdominal pain, who was diagnosed through a CT scan with a caudal pancreatic tumor. The patient underwent spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy. The result of the histopathological examination revealed a serous cystadenoma.
