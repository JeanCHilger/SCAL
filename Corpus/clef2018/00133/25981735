Pearls and pitfalls of imaging metastatic disease from pancreatic adenocarcinoma: a systematic review. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is a systemic disease due to the presence of metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis and local recurrence as well as distant metastatic disease after treatment in a majority of patients. Recognition of these metastatic sites may help in accurate staging and assessment of therapeutic response. The authors discuss and illustrate imaging findings of metastatic disease from pancreatic adenocarcinoma in different organ systems with emphasis on entities that can mimic metastatic pancreatic cancer.
