Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas associated with familial adenomatous polyposis. A man in his thirties visited our hospital for an evaluation of a 12Ã—10-mm pancreatic solid tumor that was accidentally detected on computed tomography performed for follow-up of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). We diagnosed the patient with a solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN) based on endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration, and he underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy. Small SPN tumors appear as solid tumors, without typical features of SPN, making the definitive diagnosis more difficult. The genetic background of FAP patients can predispose them to SPN, and imaging of the pancreas should be performed at prescribed intervals in FAP patients.
