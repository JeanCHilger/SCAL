Does PET with CT Have Clinical Utility in the Management of Patients with Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm? Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are well-established pancreatic precancerous lesions. Indications for resection are outlined in the 2012 International Consensus Guidelines (ICG). Because of the low specificity of the ICG, many patients will undergo potentially unnecessary surgery for nonmalignant IPMNs. Several retrospective studies have reported that positron emission tomography (PET) with CT (PET/CT) is highly sensitive and specific in detecting malignant IPMNs. We hypothesized that PET/CT complements the ICG in identification of malignant IPMNs.From 2009 to 2013, patients with a suspected clinical or cytopathologic diagnosis of IPMN were prospectively enrolled in a clinical trial at a single center. Results of preoperative PET/CT on determination of IPMN malignancy (ie, high-grade dysplastic and invasive) was compared with surgical pathology. PET/CT uptake was considered increased if the standardized uptake value was â‰¥3.Of the 67 patients enrolled, 50 patients met all inclusion criteria. Increased PET/CT uptake was associated with significantly more malignant and invasive IPMNs (80% vs 13% p < 0.0001 and 40% vs 3%The addition of PET/CT to preoperative workup improves the performance of the ICG for predicting malignant risk in patients with IPMN.
