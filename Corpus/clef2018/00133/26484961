The Role of Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography in Management and Prediction of Survival in Pancreatic Cancer. The role of positron emission tomography (PET) and PET/computed tomography (CT) in the management of pancreatic cancer patients has not been clearly established. Although value of PET/CT in the staging of pancreatic cancer is still being debated, several studies pointed to its superior role in determining therapy response, recurrence detection, and survival prediction in comparison to conventional imaging including contrast-enhanced CT. This article reviews the current literature on usefulness of PET/CT in the management of pancreatic cancer patients.
