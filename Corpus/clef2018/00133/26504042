Gene Expression of Col11A1 Is a Marker Not only for Pancreas Carcinoma But also for Adenocarcinoma of the Papilla of Vater, Discriminating Between Carcinoma and Chronic Pancreatitis. For tumors of the periampullary region clinical differentiation between primary and tumor-associated pancreatitis might be difficult. Early diagnosis of these malignancies is essential, as they present with early invasion of surrounding tissue thus limiting therapeutic options. Using molecular markers, the preoperative diagnosis (EUS-guided needle biopsy, brush biopsy pancreatic duct) could be optimized and surgical therapy potentially adapted. Alpha1 (XI) collagen Col11A1 is essential for the extracellular matrix and normal skeletal development and has been associated with carcinogenesis.Forty-three patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, 11 with adenocarcinoma of the papilla of Vater and 23 patients with chronic pancreatitis were included in the study. For all patients mRNA expression of Col11A1 was quantified by TaqMan RT-PCR in tumor or pancreatitis specimen, as well as in the corresponding normal uninvolved tissue and correlated with diagnosis of cancer and chronic pancreatitis.Col11A1 mRNA expression was 5.25-fold higher in adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (p=0.006) and 8.25-fold in the papilla of Vater (p=0.002) compared to that of chronic pancreatitis specimen.Differential mRNA expression of Col11A1 may be applied to preoperatively differentiate between tumors of the periampullary region and chronic pancreatitis and this may potentially have a positive effect on patient survival.
