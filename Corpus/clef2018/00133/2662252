Pancreatic transplants: CT with clinical and pathologic correlation. A retrospective evaluation of 68 CT scans in 17 patients with pancreatic allografts was performed with clinical and pathologic correlation to better define the nature of abnormalities detected with CT and the role of CT in patient treatment. Patients with clinical complications demonstrated variable degrees of pancreatic inhomogeneity and peripancreatic inflammation on CT scans. These findings were similar in appearance to pancreatitis in the native gland. Most patients proved to be undergoing acute rejection. However, these findings were not specific and were also seen with peripancreatic infection, hemorrhage, and exocrine anastomotic leaks. No CT changes were detected in two of three patients with late rejection. Thus, CT was not helpful in the diagnosis of pancreatic rejection. The most beneficial role of CT was in the detection of intraabdominal fluid collections, including abscesses, hematomas, and pseudocysts. Percutaneous aspiration was invaluable in the distinction between infected and sterile fluid collections however, percutaneous drainage was of limited use in treatment.
