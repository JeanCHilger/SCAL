A Case of Gastric and Pancreatic Cancer Resected with Curative Intent while Preserving Organ Function. A 57-year-old woman was diagnosed with a pancreatic tumor. Abdominal computed tomography showed cStage Ⅳa pancreatic cancer with a 20×16 mm tumor near the base of the celiac artery. Since the tumor contacted the SMA at an angle of 90 degrees, it was judged as a borderline resectable tumor. In addition, cStage ⅠB gastric cancer was found in the corpus ventriculi. Since the patient had a respiratory complication, a distal pancreatectomy with celiac axis resection in combination with a total gastrectomy was considered too aggressive for this patient. Therefore, she received chemoradiotherapy prior to the surgery. Distal pancreatectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy and subtotal gastrectomy with lower left phrenic artery preservation was performed. This case involved a considerable extension of the disease and radical surgery however, currently the patient's prognosis and QOL are good.
