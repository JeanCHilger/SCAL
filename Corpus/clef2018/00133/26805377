A Resected Case of Acinar Cell Carcinoma Diagnosed by Endoscopic Ultrasound Guided Fine-Needle Aspiration Prior to Surgical Treatment. Acinar cell carcinoma (ACC) of the pancreas is an extremely rare tumor type, accounting for approximately 1% of all pancreatic neoplasm. Here, we report a rare case of ACC of the pancreas diagnosed on the basis of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) findings prior to surgical treatment. A 73-years-old woman was being followed-up for chronic hepatitis C at our institution. Abdominal enhanced computed tomography showed an enhanced region, 16 mm in size, near the head of the pancreas on early-phase images. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography did not show interruption or dilatation of the main pancreatic duct. Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography/computed tomography showed an increased FDG uptake in the mass (SUVmax=12.7). EUS-FNA indicated a diagnosis of ACC, and pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed. Pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of ACC. The patient was discharged after an 18-day hospital stay. Two years later, the patient has not shown any sings of recurrence.
