Preoperative Arterial Embolization with N-butyl-2 Cyanoacrylate for Chronic Cavitary Pulmonary Aspergillosis with Trauma Induced Type Ⅰ Diabetes Mellitus. A 50-year-old man with hemoptysis, given a diagnosis of left upper lobe pulmonary aspergilloma with cavity and fungus ball by computed tomography. He has a history of typeⅠ diabetes mellitus due to traumatic injury of pancreas and underwent diaphragm plasty. Despite of systemic anti-fungal medication, symptom and radiological findings were not progressed and surgical intervention was planned. Before surgery we performed intercostal artery embolization, in order to minimize bleeding on dissecting adhesion between the chest wall and the lobe with aspergilloma. Left upper lobectomy with muscle-flap prombage was done safely with a blood loss of 450 ml. Postoperative course was favorable. Intercostal artery embolization with N-butyl-2cyanoacrylate is an effective way to minimize hemorrhage during surgical resection for pulmonary aspergillosis with sever adhesion.
