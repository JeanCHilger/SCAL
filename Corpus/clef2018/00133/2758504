Detection of changes using computer tomography in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. In 28 newly discovered diabetic patients of 2nd type (non-insulin-dependent diabetics), computer tomography was used to determine the density of pancreas and kidneys, densities of liver, spleen and blood in abdominal aorta and to follow the occurrence of further pathological changes in the above mentioned tissues. The results were correlated with laboratory findings. The following changers were found: decreased density of pancreas (29.4 H) and liver (49.1 H) and increased density of spleen (56.3 H) and blood in abdominal aorta (43.7 H). The decreased density of pancreas appears to be connected with disorder of lipoprotein metabolism. The decreased liver density was related to increased energy intake in the food and overweight, evaluated by the Broc's index. Other findings of computer tomography in the newly discovered diabetics of 2nd type (changes in the size of pancreas, kidney, kidney cyst, nephrolithiasis, sclerotic plaques on aorta) were not significant.
