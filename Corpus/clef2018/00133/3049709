Microcystic adenoma of the pancreas: spectrum of computed tomographic findings. Fourteen cases of microcystic adenoma (serous cystadenoma) of the pancreas were reviewed and radiological findings were correlated with pathological specimens. Microcystic adenomas appeared grossly either as solid tumors with innumerable tiny cysts or as honeycombed cystic tumors depending on the size and number of cysts and amount of connective tissue. Dynamic enhanced CT of the tumor reflected the amount of connective tissue and appeared as (a) densely enhanced spongy masses (n = 6: classic appearance) (b) cystic masses with (n = 6) or without (n = 1) enhanced septa
