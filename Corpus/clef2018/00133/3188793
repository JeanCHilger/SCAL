The role of computed tomography in the management of acute pancreatitis. Sixty-three patients with the clinical diagnosis of acute pancreatitis were submitted to contrast enhanced CT examination. As compared to Ranson's objective clinical parameters, CT grading according to Hill et al. as modified by Balthazar et al. was found to reflect accurately the severity of acute pancreatitis. Evaluation of serial CT examination did not reveal any significant progression in classification during the course of acute pancreatitis. The presence of hypodense areas in the pancreas as a single parameter seems to have a distinct prognostic value. In only one out of five pancreatic abscesses was the presence of gas bubbles observed on CT. It is concluded that contrast enhanced CT has a definite place in the management of acute pancreatitis.
