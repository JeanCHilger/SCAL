Pancreatic pseudocyst involving the spleen. Pancreatic pseudocyst involving the spleen in a 52-year-old man is reported, with review of the literature. Physical examination and laboratory data revealed no specific abnormalities. A CT scan demonstrated multiple calcifications throughout the pancreas, with a cystic mass in the tail of the pancreas involving the spleen. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) revealed a dilated main pancreatic duct with a direct communication to the cyst. Distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy was performed on a diagnosis of pancreatic pseudocyst. The 10 x 9.5 x 7 cm in size cyst had no epithelial lining on its wall. The amylase level in the cystic fluid was 23424 IU/l. The literature reveals that hemorrhagic complications are common and often serious. Timely surgical intervention is advocated to reduce mortality and morbidity from complications.
