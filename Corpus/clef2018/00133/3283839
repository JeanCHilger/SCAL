Pancreatic transplantation: scintigraphy, US, and CT. Twenty-one patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus received simultaneous renal and segmental pancreatic transplants. A retrospective analysis of 112 real-time ultrasound (US) images, 108 technetium-99m glucoheptonate scinti-scans, 55 computed tomography (CT) scans, and 11 cystograms was performed. Complications that were observed included pancreatic transplant rejection, pancreatitis, arteriovenous occlusions, hemorrhage, abscesses, and extravasation at the pancreaticocystostomy site. Scintigraphy is a sensitive indicator of normal transplant function but is non-specific when findings are abnormal. Real-time US aids in the differentiation of acute rejection from pancreatitis and arteriovenous occlusion. CT is helpful for evaluation of postoperative complications. Imaging may play an important role in the noninvasive management of pancreatic transplants.
