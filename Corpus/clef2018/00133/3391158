Is chymotrypsin output a better diagnostic index than the measurement of chymotrypsin in random stool? This study compares the diagnostic utility of fecal chymotrypsin (CT) output in timed stool collections and random stools using a new photometric enzyme assay. The CT output (mean +/- SD, U/24 h) was 1,487 +/- 1,980 in 127 children with normal fat absorption and negative sweat-chloride test (mean age 45 months), and 1,804 +/- 1,452 in 27 cases with fat malabsorption due to nonpancreatic disease (mean age 41 months). 66 cases of cystic fibrosis (CF) were examined (mean age 119 months). Stool output in 19 newly diagnosed patients before therapy was 85 +/- 94, in 42 patients receiving enzyme replacement therapy was 3,462 +/- 2,841, and in 5 patients with pancreatic sufficiency 1,754 +/- 1,482. Using nonparametric statistics, 120 U/24 h was defined as the lower limit of the 95-percentile for stool CT output. Only 5 of the 127 patients with normal fat absorption had output below that limit. None of the patients with nonpancreatic malabsorption and only 1 treated CF patient had lower values. Sixteen of the newly diagnosed CF patients had stool CT less than 120 U/24 h. The sensitivity of the test is therefore 84% and its specificity 97% at this decision threshold. However, no diagnostic advantage is gained from measuring CT output in timed stool collections as compared to random stools.
