Polycystic hydatid disease (Echinococcus vogeli): clinical and radiological manifestations and treatment with albendazole of a patient from the Brazilian Amazon region. We present a case of polycystic hydatid disease produced by Echinococcus vogeli in a tapper of rubber trees from the State of Acre, Brazil. The most relevant clinical data were pain, increased abdominal volume caused by palpable painful masses, fever and poor clinical condition. Laboratory tests showed anemia, eosinophilia, hypoalbuminemia, hypergammaglobulinemia and increased plasma levels of alkaline phosphatase. Computerized tomography revealed diffuse cysts throughout the peritoneal cavity up to the pelvis, and inside the liver, pancreas and spleen. Anatomopathological examinations of cysts obtained by laparotomy confirmed the etiological diagnosis. Treatment with 10 mg/kg Albendazole for 6 months caused complete regression of the disease.
