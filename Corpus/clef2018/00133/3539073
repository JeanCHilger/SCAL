Cystadenoma of the pancreas. Various aspects of the diagnosis and surgical management adopted in 3 cases. The authors report three cases of cystadenoma of the pancreas. Two cases were serouscystadenoma and one case was mucouscystadenoma. The best diagnostic procedures were computed axial tomography and ultrasonography. Decisions regarding operation depend on three factors: the patient's general conditions, site of the tumor and hystologic pattern. In the first case the elderly patient had the tumor in the head of the pancreas which had led to biliary obstruction. To establish satisfactory biliary drainage a biliodigestive anastomosis was used. The other two cases were younger patients with large protruding abdominal mass in the epigastrium and mesogastrium by a tumor of the body and tail of the pancreas. In these cases we opted for body pancreatectomy and splenectomy. Since the serouscystadenoma doesn't have the malignant potential that the mucouscystadenoma has, the surgical procedure can be different from the surgical resection used for the treatment of pancreatic cystadenoma.
