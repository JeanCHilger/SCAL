Transection of the pancreas demonstrated by ultrasound and computed tomography. The early occurrence of peritoneal signs and hyperamylasemia in a 14-year-old boy, who had fallen off his horse, urged us to perform a sonographic and computed tomographic study of the upper abdomen. Both examinations showed a complete pancreatic rupture. Distal pancreatectomy led to a rapid and uneventful recovery.
