Duodenopancreatic injuries. Diagnostic and therapeutic considerations apropos of 25 cases. A review of a homogeneous series of 25 cases of duodenopancreatic injuries emphasizes the serious nature of the lesions operated upon at the acute pancreatitis stage. An early diagnosis of these duodenopancreatic lesions is essential since they are often included in the context of multiple injuries. Principal diagnostic difficulties arise in lesions due to contusion without associated intra-abdominal injuries. In these cases ultrasound and CT scan imaging provide valuable data, particularly the latter exploration which is 89% reliable in demonstrating pancreatic morphology. Treatment differs as a function of presence of isolated or combined duodenal and pancreatic lesions and of lesional type. It should be as conservative as possible, although exeresis for lesions of body and tail of pancreas is currently performed more frequently.
