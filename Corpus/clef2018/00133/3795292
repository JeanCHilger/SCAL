Microcystic adenoma: the specificity of computerized tomography in making the distinction. Microcystic adenoma can be diagnosed by computerized tomography (CT) alone. With highly specific CT, the central, stellate ("starlight") calcifications that are pathognomonic of microcystic adenoma can be distinguished. Microcystic adenoma, a glycogen-rich, cystic neoplasm of the pancreas, is usually composed of groups of cysts smaller than 2 cm. The lesion is possibly premalignant.
