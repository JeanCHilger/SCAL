Non-fusion of the ventral and dorsal pancreatic ducts. Non-fusion of the ventral and dorsal pancreatic ducts is an anomaly of the ductal system of the pancreas no connection between the ventral and the dorsal pancreatic ducts. The pancreas, however, keeps normal shape examined by US, CT, and laparotomy. The dorsal pancreatography through the accessory papilla is essential in diagnosis of non-fusion, because the short pancreatic duct through the main papilla is sometimes observed in chronic pancreatitis, anomalous defect of the distal pancreas, pancreatic cancer, and cyst. The 30 cases of the non-fusion were experienced in our institute which were all confirmed by dorsal pancreatography
