Radiation dose in abdominal examinations with whole body computer tomography (author's transl). The somatic and genetic radiation exposure in abdominal CT examinations with Delta 50 and Delta 50 fast was measured via thermoluminescent dosimeters and compared with the exposure in conventional methods of x-ray diagnosis. With Delta 50 fast, the dose surface product for on examination of the pancreas is about 2900 Rcm2, and for an examination of the kidneys about 3400 Rcm2. It is thus comparable with a gastrointestinal examination or a urogram. The gonadal doses determined for CT are lower than those received from standard x-ray examination.
