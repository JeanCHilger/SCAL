Contrast enhancement of the pancreas in computed tomography. Contrast enhancement of pancreas, liver, kidney, muscle, and blood was measured from computed tomography scans of 46 patients, including patients with normal pancreas (20), pancreatitis (20), and pancreatic carcinoma (6). A bolus injection of contrast agent was given intravenously. Contrast enhancement and contrast distribution volume in a single scan of the pancreas were measured at 40 sec and at 2, 5, and 15 min after the injection. There was a slight delay in the uptake of contrast material by pancreatic tissue if the disease was severe. In all other aspects, the pattern of contrast enhancement was equal in various patient groups and included great individual variations. Visually, the contrast agent distribution in severe pancreatitis was uneven. In severe pancreatitis, edema was seen both in the pancreas and surrounding tissues. It is concluded that gross anatomic changes and visual estimation are the only means of studying pancreatic pathology with an 18 sec scan time, and that contrast enhancement in such a study provides little additional diagnostic information.
