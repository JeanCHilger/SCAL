Subcapsular splenic hematoma vs intrasplenic pancreatic pseudocyst. An intrasplenic pancreatic pseudocyst may mimic a subcapsular splenic hematoma. Misdiagnosis of this entity may have serious consequences. Particular care should be taken when a patient presents with a cystic mass in the region of the spleen and a history of chronic alcohol abuse, regardless of the presence or absence of a history of a traumatic episode. Thin-needle aspiration is the current diagnostic modality of choice. A high fluid amylase level establishes the diagnosis of an intrasplenic pancreatic pseudocyst.
