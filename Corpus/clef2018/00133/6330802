Radiodiagnosis of glucagonoma and vipoma, 2 rare endocrine pancreatic tumors. From the non-B-cell tumors of the pancreas the gastrinoma (Zollinger-Ellison-syndrome) is the best known. The glucagonoma and the vipoma are less known and less common. The diagnosis of these syndroms, produced by overproduction of hormones, is a clinical one. The radiodiagnost has to localize the primary tumor and to exclude metastases. The x-ray findings of the glucagonoma in 3 patients and of the vipoma in 1 patient are described.
