Central vein hyperalimentation in pancreatic ascites. Central vein hyperalimentation completely relieved pancreatic ascites associated with rupture of the main pancreatic duct in a patient after unsuccessful peripheral vein alimentation therapy. In two patients with pancreatic ascites associated with pseudocysts, central vein hyperalimentation was associated with complete relief of ascites in one and marked reduction in the other. Endoscopic pancreatography and ultrasonographic or computerized scanning studies revealed lesions that were considered requiring operative treatment in all the three patients these studies should therefore be done even in patients whose ascites is completely relieved during medical therapy.
