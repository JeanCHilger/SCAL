The value of computer tomography and sonography in the investigation of the pancreas (author's transl). Three hundred and five patients were examined by computer tomography and sonography. In 117 patients no abnormalities were found in the pancreas. The accuracy of computer tomography was 87%, of sonography 85%. In 41 patients the presence of a carcinoma of the pancreas was confirmed histologically. In this group the sensitivity of computer tomography was 83%, of sonography 85%. Thirty-four patients suffered from acute pancreatitis. In this group sensitivity of the two methods was equal at 79%. 113 patients had changes of chronic pancreatitis. Sensitivity of computer tomography was 84%, of sonography 70%. Computer tomography is better at demonstrating calcification in the pancreas. Atrophy of the pancreas cannot be diagnosed by sonography.
