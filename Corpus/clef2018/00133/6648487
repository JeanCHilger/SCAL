Ultrasound diagnosis via the gastroscope. Eighty patients presenting with various diseases of the upper abdominal organs were investigated in an initial series of examinations performed with an ultrasonic endoscope provided with a mechanical sector scanner (7.5 MHz rated frequency, sector selectable between 90 degrees and 180 degrees), and/or a linear array device (7.0 MHz rated frequency, field of view 31 mm). Orientation, which was initially difficult, was facilitated by establishing standard positions. The pancreas, liver, gallbladder, bile duct, spleen, the two kidneys, the vessels of the upper abdomen, the wall of the stomach and, of course, the heart, are all accessible to endoscopic diagnostic ultrasound. At the present state of our knowledge, the method does not appear suitable for the systematic diagnostic work-up of the upper abdominal organs, but in certain cases it would seem to be a useful supplementary examination to external ultrasonography or endoscopy.
