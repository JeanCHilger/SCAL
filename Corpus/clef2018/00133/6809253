Pancreatic cancer. As a result of increased funding in the past few years, carcinoma of the pancreas has received increased investigative attention. A substantial body of epidemiologic data has been recorded, which may ultimately provide leads that identify an "at risk" population. Current diagnostic techniques enable clinicians to diagnose pancreatic lesions of relatively small size. Combined with further developments in the tumor marker field, it should be feasible to screen the at-risk population for early disease. Until then, only the early pancreatic lesion permits the slightest hope of cure.
