Pancreatic cancer. Epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and therapy. The prognosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma is still very poor. Research activities have, however, been instituted recently in all fields. Epidemiologic studies indicate etiologic roles of diabetes mellitus, smoking, and meat and coffee consumption. Sonography of the pancreas is at present the best screening method. The significance of computerized tomography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), arteriography and tumor markers is discussed. A TNM staging system and prognostic factors are presented. Resection is the treatment of choice for organ-limited pancreatic cancer. The development of new radiation modalities (e.g. pi-mesons) promises improved loco-regional tumor control. The most effective chemotherapy consists of combinations containing 5-fluorouracil, adriamycin and mitomycin-C. Intensive future research in the field of pancreatic cancer is essential if the prognosis of this devastating disease is to be improved.
