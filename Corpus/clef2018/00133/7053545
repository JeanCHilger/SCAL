Impact of high-resolution computed tomography of the pancreas on utilization of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and angiography. The impact of computed tomography (CT) on utilization of other diagnostic procedures was studied by comparing the results obtained in two groups of patients: (a) 278 patients studied prior to the availability of CT, and (b) 300 patients studied using CT. CT enabled an accurate diagnosis in 74% of patients without the use of additional examinations. Utilization of CT as the initial imaging procedure resulted in a decrease in the utilization of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and angiography by 68% and 54%, respectively. This resulted in a 47% decrease in the overall cost of radiologic diagnosis.
