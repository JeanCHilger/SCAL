Computed tomography and the dilated pancreatic duct: an ominous sign. The main pancreatic duct has been visualized with both ultrasound and computed tomography. A normal pancreatic duct has not been reported using CT, and controversy persists over whether a normal duct can be routinely imaged with ultrasound. The dilated pancreatic duct has always been associated with disease -- usually pancreatitis or a proximal obstructing pancreatic carcinoma. In the patient with no clinical history or laboratory data suggesting pancreatitis, a dilated pancreatic duct implies a proximal tumor.
