Pancreatic tumor imaging by III generation CT, gray-scale ultrasound and improved angiography. Thanks to computed tomography (CT) and gray-scale ultrasounds the possibilities of morphological diagnosis in pancreatic disease have improved. Nevertheless, only a part of the potential performances of this practice is known and especially for ultrasounds, where only an expert eye can properly read the resulting images. With the help of pictures we hereby deal with the above-mentioned procedures in the demonstration of a pancreatic neoplasm. The possible integration with other more invasive methods was verified compared to pancreatic angiography. The latter is irreplaceable in the presurgical stage, and the method proposed by the authors can be useful when other methods cannot be employed.
