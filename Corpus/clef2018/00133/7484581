Helical CT for the preoperative localization of islet cell tumors of the pancreas: value of arterial and parenchymal phase images. In two-phase helical CT, organs are scanned in both the arterial and the parenchymal phase after IV injection of contrast material. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the usefulness of two-phase helical CT for the preoperative localization of pancreatic islet cell tumors.Ten patients with 11 surgically proven islet cell tumors were included in the study. Helical CT scans of the pancreas were obtained with 5-mm collimation and overlapping image reconstruction. Images were obtained in the arterial and parenchymal phases after contrast material injection. A test bolus was used for tailored bolus timing. Images were analyzed by two observers. If a tumor was detected, its density relative to the surrounding parenchyma was scored by consensus, using a five-point scale.Nine of 11 tumors could be located using two-phase helical CT (sensitivity, 82%), including one 4-mm gastrinoma. Two lesions smaller than 5 mm could not be visualized. Two tumors were easier to detect (n = 1) or could only be detected on parenchymal-phase images (n = 1). Tumor conspicuity was better on arterial-phase images in two patients.Our results show that obtaining CT scans in both the arterial and the parenchymal phase leads to improved detection of pancreatic islet cell tumors.
