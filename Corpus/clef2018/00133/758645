Computed body tomography in chronic pancreatitis. CT of the pancrease permitted correct positive diagnosis in 28/50 or 56% of patients with chronic pancreatitis proved by laparotomy or retrograde ductography. Diagnoses were based on CT identification of one or more specific hallmarks of chronic pancreatitis including calcifications (18/50 or 36%), parenchymal atrophy (7/50 or 14%) and pancreatic duct dilatation (2/50 or 4%), as well as the principal surgical complications, pseudocyst and abscess (15/50 or 30%). In 9 patients, CT disclosed pancreatic calcifications not visible on conventional radiographs. In 32 patients, ultrasound was less informative than CT giving a correct diagnosis in 8 pseudocycts (25%). In the patient with unexplained upper abdominal complaints, a positive CT diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis permits more confident patient management than a negative, or "no tumor" diagnosis rendered by other noninvasive examinations.
