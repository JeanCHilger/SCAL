Gastric volvulus: more common than previously thought? Over a four year period, from August 1987 to July 1991, thirteen cases of chronic and recurrent gastric volvulus were encountered comprising six paediatric and seven adult patients. In none of the patients was the condition clinically suspected diagnosis being made only at meticulous upper gastro-intestinal (UGI) barium series. The paediatric patients typically presented with obstructive symptoms of projectile vomiting especially after meals and failure to thrive. The adults had variable symptoms of dyspepsia, recurrent intermittent upper abdominal discomfort or pain, occasionally accompanied by vomiting or retching mimicking many different upper abdominal conditions, such as peptic ulcer, biliary tract or pancreatic disease but with negative findings at endoscopy and abdominal ultrasound scanning. All cases were organo-axial type of gastric volvulus. Associated conditions were small sliding hiatus hernia in two adult cases
