An analysis of the endoscopies of the biliary tract performed at the Hospital Santo Tom√°s. Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed in 146 patients, 93 female and 53 male from 10 to 90 years of age. The patients were referred because it was deemed that it was necessary to perform the procedure to establish or confirm the clinical diagnosis (suspected choledocholithiasis, icterus or abdominal pain of undetermined etiology, pancreatitis or obstruction of prosthesis) and to perform cholangiography and pancreatography, papillotomy, extraction of calculi and placement of biliary prosthesis, as indicated. It was shown that the clinical picture was due to choledocholithiasis in the majority of patients. Stenosis due to inflammatory changes or to tumor were much less frequent. In few patients, there was biliary external fistula, distortion of intrahepatic ducts, cancer of the pancreas or sclerosing cholangitis. Chronic pancreatitis, choledochal granuloma or adenoma, or displacement of a T tube were found occasionally. There were few complications (cholangitis, pancreatitis and hyperamylasemia) and no mortality associated with the procedure.
