Diagnostic strategy for malignancy and parenchymal invasion of so-called mucin-producing tumor of the pancreas. This study investigated diagnostic indications of malignancy and parenchymal invasion of so-called mucin-producing tumor of the pancreas (MPT). We reviewed 40 patients with this type tumor. In diagnosis of malignancy, jaundice, mural nodule (EUS), displacement or compression of the portal vein (angiography), compression of the common bile duct (cholangiography) and Group IV-V in biopsy, Class III-V in brushing cytology were important. In diagnosis of parenchymal invasion, solid mass (US, EUS, CT), arterial encasement (angiography), defect in the common bile duct (cholangiography), stenosis or obstruction of the MPD (pancreatography) and elevation of serum CA19-9, CEA levels were important. By these findings, MPT diagnosed as benign can be observed without surgical treatment. On the other hand, MPT diagnosed as malignant must be treated by surgical resection, and operative procedure must be chosen according to whether the MPT was accompanied by parenchymal invasion or not.
