A case of chronic pancreatitis with pseudocysts complicated by infection and obstructive jaundice. We report a case of chronic pancreatitis with pseudocysts complicated by infection and obstructive jaundice. A 49-yr-old male was admitted with the complaints of fever and jaundice. Laboratory findings included high biliary tract enzyme values and normal serum amylase value. Ultrasonography and computed tomographic scan demonstrated a cyst, 4 cm in diameter, in the pancreas head. Cholangiography revealed a long, tapered obstruction of the common bile duct which was apparently compressed by the cyst. Although the jaundice improved after percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage, fever continued, and the cyst was aspirated. Bacteriological examination of the contents revealed infection. The symptoms disappeared rapidly and the cyst decreased in size soon after aspiration. The stenosis of the common bile duct showed improvement for several weeks but then regressed. In a patient with secondary pancreatic infection or obstructive jaundice following pancreatic disease, distinguishing the condition is an important aspect of accurate diagnosis and therapy.
