Fat necrosis. An unusual cause of polyarthritis. Metastatic fat necrosis is a form of lobular panniculitis which together with synovitis is an unusual complication of pancreatic disease. It can precede an attack of pancreatitis. Pancreatic disease should therefore be remembered as a cause of panniculitis. Serum amylase and abdominal ultrasonography should be considered to exclude pancreatic disease in cases of panniculitis of uncertain etiology. We describe a case of metastatic fat necrosis and discuss the appearance on magnetic resonance imaging.
