A case report of epithelioid leiomyosarcoma of transverse mesocolon: diagnosis and treatment. A case of epithelioid leiomyosarcoma of the transverse mesocolon in a 45-year-old man was reported. The patient had a rapidly growing mass in the left upper quadrant. Ultrasonography, gastrointestinography, and abdominal computed tomography showed that the mass was separated from the pancreas, the gastrointestinal tract, and the retroperitoneal organs. Preoperatively the primary origin of this tumor was related to the transverse mesocolon. On laparotomy the tumor of 5cm by 6cm by 3cm in size was found in the anterior left of the transverse mesocolon and the mass was resected entirely. The patient is well 18 months after surgical treatment with no evidence of recurrence.
