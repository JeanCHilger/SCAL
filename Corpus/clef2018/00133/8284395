To describe typical findings of focal fatty sparing of the pancreas.Computed tomography, ultrasonography, and/or magnetic resonance imaging were performed in seven patients.In these patients, the area of sparing of fatty change was within the head or uncinate process of the pancreas.Differentiating pancreatic fatty sparing from true neoplasm by means of cross-sectional imaging obviates the need for invasive diagnostic studies.
