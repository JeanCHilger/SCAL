Common bile duct calculus: MRI findings. Ultrasonography and CT were done in a case of obstructive jaundice. Ultrasonography showed gallstones and a dilated common bile duct CT revealed multiple hyperdense lesions in the liver, gallbladder calculus, and a dilated common bile duct, which terminated abruptly in an apparent pancreatic mass. MRI confirmed the presence of multiple liver hemangiomas and gallbladder calculi and further revealed an obstructing common bile duct calculus as well as the absence of a pancreatic mass.
