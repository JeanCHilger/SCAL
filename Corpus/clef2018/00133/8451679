Use of endoscopic ultrasonography for evaluation of painless jaundice. Precise preoperative evaluation and staging of cases of painless jaundice is extremely important. Many of the patients are older and may have multiple medical problems that increase their operative risk. Assessment of the distal common bile duct, ampulla of Vater, and head of the pancreas is particularly difficult. Various imaging modalities are available but are not sensitive enough to detect small lesions or local invasion. Endoscopic ultrasonography is a new technique that places the transducer closer to the organ being evaluated, adding a new dimension to defining tumor invasion and extension.
