Abdominal tomometry. 1st results in exploration of the liver and pancreas. Over a two month period, 120 patients were explored using an Acta Scanner tomometer for various hepatic disorders. In parallel, comparison was made of anatomical slices and computed tomography findings in cadavers and isolated livers. This made it possible to recognise normal structures seen at computed tompgraphy and to identify certain hepatic images which might be sources of error. Serial transverse axial sections were used to reconstruct the whole liver in space, thereby making it possible to eliminate certain cases of pseudotumoral hepatomegaly. Systematic densitometry was carried out using hepatic radio-anatomical and pathological studies. This new type of analysis led to a quantified diagnosis in certain diffuse hepatic disorders and a histological approach to tumour lesions. Hepatography using special contrast agents in very low dosage was used in liver computed tomography after animal experiments. This method, free of untoward effects, makes possible the diagnosis of hepatosplenic tumour lesions less than one centimetre in diameter.
