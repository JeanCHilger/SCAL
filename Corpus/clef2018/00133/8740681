The present state and future of endoscopic surgery. The present state and future of endoscopic surgery is analyzed on the basis of our own experience with endoscopic methods applied in clinical practice. Data were obtained from 73,572 diagnostic endoscopies and 1975 surgical procedures performed between 1972 and 1994. A significant role of endoscopic procedures was observed in stomach and duodenum surgery, bile duct and pancreatic surgery and colorectal surgery. We performed 9100 ERCP, 1200 endoscopic sphincterotomies, 61 bile duct prosthesis placement, 1086 cholangioscopies, 61,105 gastroscopies, 422 endoscopic hemostasis of the upper GI tract, and 376 curative polypectomies. We introduced sphincter Oddi manometry, endoscopic ultrasonography and minimal invasive methods to surgical practice in the treatment of oesophageal, gastric and rectal strictures such as balloon dilation and laser recanalization. Modern endoscopic methods used together with ultrasonography, radiology and computer techniques create progress in surgery.
