Cystic lymphangioma of the pancreas. Cystic lymphangioma of the pancreas is a rare condition. A 14-year-old girl presented with a cystic abdominal mass and abdominal pain. She was initially treated by biopsy and cyst drainage, and subsequently with partial excision of the cystic mass. The mass, which was a cystic lymphangioma involving the pancreas, recurred after each operation. Persisting symptoms led to a pylorus-preserving pancreatectomy and hepaticojejunostomy. Total excision is the only effective method of treating this benign tumour. The patient remains symptom free 2 1/2 years after pancreatectomy.
