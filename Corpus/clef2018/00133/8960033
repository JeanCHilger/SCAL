Positive economic and diagnostic accuracy impacts of on-site evaluation of fine needle aspiration biopsies by pathologists. To investigate the impact of pathologists' immediate evaluation of fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) on increasing diagnostic yield and decreasing related expenses.All FNABs performed at our 420-bed hospital between January 1992 and December 1994 were reviewed. The 1992-1993 FNABs were all performed without pathologist attendance. Smears were wet fixed in 95% alcohol and later stained by the Papanicolaou or hematoxylin and eosin methods. The remaining aspirated material was collected in Saccomano's preservative, and a cell block was made. Nearly all the 1994 FNABs were performed with the pathologist present he examined air-dried, Diff-Quik-stained smears for preliminary evaluation of the aspirate. An average of three passes were done. The rest of the procedure was as usual.The total number of 1992-1993 FNABs was 227 (108 + 119) of them, 104 (46%) were inadequate for diagnosis. In contrast, the 1994 FNABs totaled 169, with only 40 (24%) inadequate for diagnosis. The vast majority of the aspirates were done on deep-seated lesions under computed tomography (CT) guidance.The results of our experience indicate that on-site evaluation by a pathologist greatly increases the diagnostic yield. Another advantage is the significant financial savings as compared to excisional tissue biopsy. In general, the expenses of a CT-guided FNAB (e.g., pancreas) average around $1,400, while charges for excisional biopsy under general anesthesia with a subsequent two- to three-day hospitalization average about $7,720.
