Incidental detection of cystic neoplasms of the pancreas. Cystic neoplasms of the pancreas are rare, accounting for less than 1% of all pancreatic tumors Since the advent of computerized tomography (CT), an increasing number of these lesions are being discovered incidentally. Compagno and Oertel were the first to thoroughly describe and differentiate the benign serous cystadenoma from the potentially or overtly malignant mucinous cystadenoma/cystadenocarcinoma spectrum. At present, our ability to definitively differentiate between these two classes of cystic neoplasms is limited. Because of this, controversy exists as to their appropriate surgical management. A case report is presented and followed by a review of the literature on incidentally detected cystic neoplasms of the pancreas.
