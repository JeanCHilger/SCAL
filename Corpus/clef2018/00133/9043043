T2-weighted and dynamic enhanced MRI in acute pancreatitis: comparison with contrast enhanced CT. The purpose of this study was to compare T2-weighted and dynamic contrast enhanced MRI with contrast enhanced CT in patients with severe acute pancreatitis. Thirty-two patients were examined using axial T2-weighted spin-echo imaging (TR 1801, TE 15/90) and a multi-slice rapid gradient-echo sequence (TR 135, TE 4, FA 80 degrees) (FLASH) in axial and coronal planes. Fifteen 5 mm axial slices at 10 mm intervals were acquired during a single breath-hold of 19 s before, and at 10 and 40 s after a bolus injection of Gd-DTPA. Additional FLASH images in the coronal plane were obtained 2 min after injection of contrast medium. MR was compared with contemporary enhanced CT by two blinded observers who scored pancreatic viability and the content of intra and extra-pancreatic fluid collections. The presence of gas, calcification and haemorrhage was noted. Abnormalities in adjacent organs, evidence of vascular occlusion and indicators of aetiology were also recorded. MR and CT were concordant in distinguishing viable pancreatic tissue from areas of necrosis. MR appeared to be more effective than CT in characterizing the content of fluid collections and in demonstrating gall stones, although CT remains superior in detecting flecks of gas and calcification. MR carries some advantages over CT and can be regarded as an alternative primary technique in patients with severe pancreatitis.
