Perfusion-weighted MR imaging in the upper abdomen: preliminary clinical experience in 61 patients. We quantitatively analyzed the potential usefulness of perfusion-weighted (PW) MR imaging of the upper abdomen performed with a single-shot gradient-recalled echo echoplanar (GRE EP) sequence.PW imaging of the upper abdomen with a GRE EP sequence was performed in 61 patients who had suspected liver or pancreatic disease. PW imaging was started at the time of administration of 0.1 mmol/kg of gadopentetate dimeglumine, and images were obtained every 2 sec for 88 sec. Time-intensity curves for the liver, pancreas, spleen, and kidney, and for subgroups of patients with various pathologic conditions, were constructed for quantitative analysis.The signal-intensity changes seen throughout the PW imaging process differed for each abdominal organ and pathologic condition. In the spleen, pancreas, and renal cortex, a transient signal-intensity decrease was seen in the perfusion phase (42%, 39%, and 78%, respectively). In the liver and renal medulla, the maximum signal-intensity decrease occurred in the later phase rather than in the perfusion phase. Signal-intensity recovery in the spleen and pancreas occurred soon after the maximum signal-intensity decrease, whereas such recovery was delayed in the liver and renal cortex. In cirrhotic livers, the signal-intensity change seen throughout the examination was minimal.Unlike conventional MR imaging, PW imaging with a GRE EP sequence can provide detailed hemodynamic information about upper abdomen organs and about disorders of these organs because of its excellent temporal resolution and susceptibility to contrast enhancement.
