Abdominal granulocytic sarcomas: demonstration by MRI. The magnetic resonance imaging findings of histologically-proven renal and pancreatic granulocytic sarcomas are demonstrated in two patients. Granulocytic sarcomas were moderately hypointense on T1-weighted images, mildly hyperintense on T2-weighted images, and enhanced in a diminished fashion on early and late postgadolinium T1-weighted images.
