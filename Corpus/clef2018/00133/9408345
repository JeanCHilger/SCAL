The part of MR cholangiography in biliary surgery. The magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRC) is a new none invasive examination procedure which demonstrates well the extrahepatic ducts. The examination can reveal all the anatomical or pathological anomalies of the biliary tracts. The authors performed this examination on 12 patients between 1st December 1996 and 31st December 1996. In 4 patients there were no pathological changes. Common bile duct stone was found in 1 patient. Sclerosis of the Vater papilla in 1 case. Mirizzi syndrome in 1 case. Carcinoma of the common bile duct in 3 cases. In 2 cases inflammation of the head of the pancreas caused compression on the bile duct. The patients were all operated. The operative and the MRC diagnosis corresponded. Similar examination procedure has not yet been mentioned in Hungary.
