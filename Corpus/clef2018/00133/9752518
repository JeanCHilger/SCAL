Evaluation of pancreatic cancer by combined laparoscopy and echolaparoscopy. This prospective study was undertaken to evaluate the efficiency of staging laparoscopy associated with laparoscopic ultrasonography in the assessment of tumoural extension and surgical resectability in patients with carcinoma of the pancreatic head.From June 1995 to March 1997, 26 consecutive patients (11 male and 15 female patients), with a mean age of 62.5 years, were included in this study. The lesion was located in the pancreatic head with jaundice. Four staging methods were used: percutaneous ultrasonography (n = 26) computed tomography (n = 26), endoscopic ultrasonography (n = 26). The assessment of resectability by each procedure was verified by surgical exploration and histologic examination.Results of percutaneous ultrasonography and computed tomography were similar, predicting unresectability in 50% of the patients. Endoscopic ultrasonography performed in the 16 patients without visible metastases according to the previous procedures predicted surgical resectability in seven patients only. With staging laparoscopy associated with laparoscopic ultrasonography, undiscovered metastases were found and unresectability was predicted in 21 patients out of 26 the sensitivity was 100% for liver metastases, peritoneal metastases and vascular involvement, 90% for lymph node involvement and 88% for diagnosis of the primitive lesion. A Whipple procedure was performed in five patients and a palliative bypass in all the other patients except one. An unnecessary laparotomy was avoided in 12 patients.Staging laparoscopy associated with laparoscopic ultrasonography is superior to all other staging methods. It should be the first step of a potentially curative surgical treatment (five cases only in this series) or of a palliative bypass. Laparotomy was avoided in 12 cases.
