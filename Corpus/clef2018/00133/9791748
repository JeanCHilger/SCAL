Acute pancreatitis: the role of diagnostic imaging. In the U.S., acute pancreatitis is usually caused by excessive consumption of ethanol or by biliary stone disease. Major pathologic finding and complications include fluid collections within the organ or the adjacent peripancreatic tissues, pseudocysts, pancreatic necrosis, pseudoaneurysm, and abscess formation. Radiologic imaging, including endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), sonography, and computed tomography (CT), are important in the evaluation of acute pancreatitis and its complications. CT in particular also aids in grading the severity of acute pancreatitis and in predicting complications and mortality however, CT correlation with Ranson's clinical prognostic factors or with other classification systems is less clear. The imaging and therapeutic aspects of acute pancreatitis are discussed and illustrated and prognostic factors are correlated.
