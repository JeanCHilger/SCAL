Eosinophilic pancreatitis mimicking pancreatic neoplasia: EUS and ERCP findings--is nonsurgical diagnosis possible? Eosinophilic pancreatitis is a rare disease with, to date, only 10 reported cases. We report two patients whose presentation was suggestive of a pancreatic tumor. An 18-year-old man presented with a short history of obstructive jaundice, epigastric pain, and weight loss. Endoscopic ultrasonography revealed a 12-mm round, hypoechoic lesion in the head of the pancreas, suggestive of a pancreatic endocrine tumor. A duo-denopancreatectomy was performed, and the patient made an uneventful recovery. A 64-year-old man was referred with weight loss and obstructive jaundice due to a stricture of the common bile duct. Retrograde pancreatography demonstrated a very narrow, regular main pancreatic duct and early parenchymography. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography revealed a tight, regular stenosis of the intrahepatic portion of the common bile duct. A gastrojejunal anastomosis and biliary-digestive bypass were performed without postoperative complications. In both cases, the diagnosis of eosinophilic pancreatitis was revealed after surgical resection. The features of eosinophilic pancreatitis, including eosinophilic infiltration of the digestive wall, a history of atopy, and the radiological characteristics are described. If these are of sufficient discriminatory value, unnecessary surgery may be avoided.
