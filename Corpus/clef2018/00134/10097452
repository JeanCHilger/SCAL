Hilar localization of splenic cyst does not always exclude the possibility of resective treatment. Non parasitic cysts of the spleen require surgical treatment because of their progressive growth and in order to prevent the potential severe complications associated with such cysts. Since it is now well known that total splenectomy, especially in young patients, has potential for short- and long-term complications, much emphasis has been placed on splenic salvage, suggesting partial splenectomy as procedure of choice for splenic cysts. However various Authors suggest that many but not all splenic cysts can be treated with partial splenectomy. In particular cystic mass arising from the anterior aspect of the hilum near to vascular peduncle contraindicate partial resection requiring splenectomy. In a case observed TC scan demonstrated a very large epidermoid cyst penetrating hilar parenchyma just above splenic vessels insertion. Preoperative imaging suggested splenectomy as the only possible procedure to remove the cyst. At operation the exposure of the splenic artery extended proximally along the pancreatic tail showed an arterial branch running with satellite vein in the splenopancreatic ligament for inferior segment of the spleen. As we found this branch it was possible to resect cyst preserving a large inferior parenchymal segment normally perfused and functioning at postoperative scintigraphic controls. In conclusion not all hilar cysts must be considered an absolute indication to splenectomy. An accurate and extensive exposure of splenic artery and vein can demonstrate vascular anatomical variations permitting resection also for large cysts located near the splenic hilum.
