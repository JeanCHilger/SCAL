Computerized tomography of pancreatic tumors. Few pancreatic carcinomas (5-22%) are resectable at the time of diagnosis because this lesion is seldom diagnosed in an early stage. A considerable improvement in the rate of survival is described only for resectable tumors: it is extremely necessary to find an imaging technique for early diagnosis and for accurate staging of pancreatic carcinoma to discern operable from inoperable cancer. The sensitivity of CT in predicting that pancreatic carcinoma is unresectable has been described as approaching 100%. However the reverse is not true. More than one third of the tumors revealed with CT and interpreted as resectable cannot be excised. The major reason for errors with CT are failure to detected liver metastases, peritoneal implants, lymph node involvement and encasement of the great vessels by tumor. Significant progress has recently been made to improve the detection of these details with the recent introduction of helical CT with infusion of a bolus of contrast material and thin section collimation. Traditionally, when a single sequence of images was acquired during abdominal CT, the time of the acquisition was dominated by the requirement to scan during maximal hepatic enhancement, which unfortunately may not be optimal for evaluation of the pancreas. With the advent of helical CT, the acquisition of two sets of images after infusion of contrast material is now possible the first one takes place during the arterial enhancement
