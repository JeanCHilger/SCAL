The timing in differential diagnosis of cystic tumors of the pancreas: clinical report of three cases of cystadenocarcinoma. The Authors analyze their own twelve-years experience about the Cystic Tumors of the Pancreas, considering the data existing in the literature. In particular, after a description of anatomo-pathological and clinical characteristics, they set out the problems in the differential diagnosis between the Cystadenocarcinomas and the other benign cystic lesions of the Pancreas. The solution of this problem is often reached only during the operation with multiple biopsies. Moreover they pay attention to the therapeutic choices, determined by the symptomatology of the patients and the localization and the histological kind of the lesions.
