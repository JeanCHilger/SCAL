Accuracy of imaging techniques and tumor markers in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of: a) three imaging techniques: ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and b) the serum tumor markers CEA, CA 19-9 and CA 125, in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.A total of 137 patients were prospectively evaluated. Pancreatic cancer was diagnosed in 25 patients chronic pancreatitis in 24CT (0.976-0.888) and US (0.857) diagnostic accuracy resulted greater than the best serum tumor marker CA 19-9 (0.755-0.786) (p = NS), in both diagnostic conditions. To obtain a diagnostic specificity of 90% in pancreatic cancer, the CA 19-9 cutoff level should increase up to 3 and 7.5 folds being in this case better than CEA and CA 125 (p < 0.05).CT scan offers the greatest accuracy in the diagnosis of PC. Among the tumor markers, CA 19-9 offers the best accuracy in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.
