Magnetic resonance pancreatography (MRP). Magnetic resonance pancreatography (MRP) is a technique that permits accurate evaluation of the pancreatic duct without instrumentation, contrast material administration, or ionizing radiation. Because MRP is entirely noninvasive, MRP avoids complications associated with endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) such as pancreatitis and perforation. MRP allows for the noninvasive evaluation of patients with acute and chronic pancreatitis, variant anatomy of the pancreatic duct, pancreatic duct trauma, and pancreatic neoplasia. MRP yields diagnostic information in the setting of a failed or incomplete ERP. When MRP is performed in conjunction with conventional abdominal MR, the result is a comprehensive examination of the pancreatic duct as well as the pancreas and other solid organs of the abdomen.
