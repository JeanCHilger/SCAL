A so-called carcinosarcoma of the gallbladder in a patient with multiple anomalies--a case report. The patient was a 65-year-old woman with a chief complaint of right upper quadrant pain. Under the diagnosis of gallbladder tumor, preduodenal portal vein and absence of the pancreatic tail, cholecystectomy was performed. Intraoperative findings resulted in a diagnosis of gallbladder tumor, absence of the pancreatic tail, presence of preduodenal portal vein, and malrotation of the intestine. Histological examination of the resected specimens showed a so-called carcinosarcoma. Carcinosarcoma of the gallbladder is a rare tumor of the hepatobiliary region. The present case differs from previously reported cases in its presentation with multiple anomalies including the presence of preduodenal portal vein. Many cases of preduodenal portal vein in an association with duodenal stenosis in children have been reported, but reports of cases of preduodenal portal vein in adult patients are rarely seen in the literature.
