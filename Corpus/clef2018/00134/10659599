A case of lymphoepithelial cyst of the pancreas. We report a relatively rare case of lymphoepithelial cyst of the pancreas. The patient, a 43-year-old man with no subjective symptoms, was found to have a pancreatic tumor during a physical examination. Based on the ultrasonographic and abdominal computed tomographic findings, a pancreatic cystic tumor was diagnosed. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography showed a normal duct system. Enucleation was easily performed. Macroscopically, the cyst resembled an atheroma. Histopathologic examination disclosed lymphoepithelial cyst of the pancreas.
