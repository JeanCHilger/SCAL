Solid and papillary epithelial neoplasm. Ultrasound and CT features of an unusual pancreatic tumour. The ultrasonographic and computed tomography features of four cases of solid and papillary epithelial neoplasm (SPEN)--a rare pancreatic tumour--are described. Although not diagnostic, the presence of these imaging features in the typical clinical setting may permit pre-operative radiological diagnosis and facilitate planning for curative surgery for this malignant tumour which has an excellent prognosis even without further adjuvant therapy.
