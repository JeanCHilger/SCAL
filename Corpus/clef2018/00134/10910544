Pancreatic tumors in children: report of three cases. From 1981 to 1996, we experienced 3 cases of pancreatic tumors in children--two pancreatoblastomas (PB) and one solid and cystic tumor (SCT). The ages were 1 month, 4 years, and 13 years of age respectively. The two cases of pancreatoblastoma initially presented as chronic diarrhea with failure to thrive, the other case presented with abdominal mass. All of them were studied by laboratory examination, ultrasonography, computed tomography and pathology. Increasing alpha- fetoprotein (AFP) levels were found in the 2 pancreatoblastoma cases, however, the level in the SCT case was normal. Abdominal sonography showed pancreatic masses with or without calcification, and the echogenicity may be solid and/or cystic. All patients underwent total excision of the tumors. We have reviewed the literature and find no pancreatoblastoma with chronic diarrhea was reported in young children, especially in neonate. Therefore, we suggest that young children presenting with an abdominal mass and/or weight loss should undergo imaging studies for the possibility of pancreatic tumors.
