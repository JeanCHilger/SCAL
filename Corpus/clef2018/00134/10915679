Venous thrombosis and occlusion after pancreas transplantation: evaluation with breath-hold gadolinium-enhanced three-dimensional MR imaging. We describe the imaging findings of venous thrombosis and occlusion after pancreatic transplantation in five patients who underwent multiphasic breath-hold gadolinium-enhanced three-dimensional MR imaging.Venous thrombus appeared as serpetine voids within the graft parenchyma or at the venous anastomosis during the venous phase of MR imaging. Nonenhancement or heterogeneous enhancement of graft parenchyma corresponded to glandular necrosis at pancreatectomy in two patients. Initial sonographic evaluation was nondiagnostic of venous thrombosis in two of five patients. Multiphasic breath-hold gadolinium-enhanced three-dimensional MR imaging of pancreatic transplants can provide information to make the specific diagnosis of venous thrombosis or occlusion.
