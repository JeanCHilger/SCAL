Multivisceral eosinophilic fibrosis: a new clinical presentation. We describe a patient who was referred to us with the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer but who had eosinophilic fibrosis of the pancreas and other organs, including the sub-mandibular salivary glands, retro-orbital tissue, liver, kidneys, and surrounding the abdominal aorta. He had no pain or other symptoms. After treatment with methylprednisolone, all lesions disappeared and now he seems to be cured of this apparently immune-mediated disorder. To our knowledge, involvement of all these particular organs by eosinophilic fibrosis in the absence of symptoms has never before been described.
