Ruptured aneurysm of the pancreaticoduodenal artery. A rare etiology of acute abdomen. Even among the uncommon aneurysms of the visceral arteries the aneurysm of the pancreaticoduodenalis artery is considered a rarity. Etiologically, numerous factors must be taken into account, the most significant one being arteriosclerosis. The clinical presentation is unspecific and ambiguous. CT and, above all, intra-arterial DSA allow for a diagnosis. A generous consideration of indicating operative intervention, even in asymptomatic patients, is especially justified because of the imminent risk of rupture. The preferable therapy consists of elimination of the aneurysm either conventionally by proximal and distal ligature of the pancreaticoduodenalis artery or endovascularly by embolization. In the future a treatment with coated stents (TPEG) would also seem possible. Special attention must be paid to concomitant occlusive disease in other visceral arteries since measures for vessel reconstruction may be required because of intraoperative impairment of the collateral circulation. We report on the rupture of an aneurysm of the pancreaticoduodenal inferior artery in association with celiac axis occlusion.
