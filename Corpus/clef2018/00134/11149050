"Ductectatic" mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of the pancreas: a case report, 5-year follow-up period. It is unknown whether the "ductectatic" mucinous cystadenoma and cystadenocarcinoma of the pancreas will develop into the classical megacystic type, and there is no report of long-term follow-up of this entity. A case of mucin-producing cystic tumor of the pancreas with pancreas divisum in a 65-year-old man is presented who was followed-up for 5 years prior to diagnosis of cancer and surgery. Computed tomography, ultrasonography and endoscopic retrograde pancreatography during the 5-year period had demonstrated insidious growth of the tumor. The histopathological diagnosis after surgery was the "ductectatic" mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of the pancreas. It was difficult for us to differentiate it from the classical megacystic type. The patient died of liver metastasis 54 months after surgery.
