Gastric duplication cyst. The aim of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties of gastric duplication cysts.A 38-year-old female patient presented with dyspepsia and repeated episodes of epigastric pain. She was operated with the diagnosis of pancreatic pseudocyst according to her US and CT scans, and found to have a gastric duplication cyst. A cyst about 80x80 mm, localized on the posterior wall of the corpus of the stomach close to the fundus, was dissected from the surrounding tissues and partially from the gastric wall. The cyst did not have muscle layer on the common wall with the stomach, so the cystic mucosa was stripped away from the gastric muscle layer. The gastric lumen was not entered.Although gastric duplication cysts do not have specific symptoms and signs, CT, MR and endoscopic ultrasonography may help the preoperative diagnosis, but the diagnosis is usually confirmed at laparotomy. Needle aspiration may cause complications.Because of the complications that may occur after needle aspiration and malignant potential of the tissue, the treatment of these cysts is surgical.
