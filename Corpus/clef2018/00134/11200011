Malignant stromal tumors of the duodenum. Report of a case. The Authors report a rare case of undifferentiated duodenal malignant stromal tumour in a 69-years-old man radically managed by pancreaticoduodenectomy and resection of a liver metastasis. Several preoperative tests were performed (barium meal, endoscopy, ultrasonography and CT scan) but failed to yield a differential diagnosis between a tumour of the pancreatic head and a retroperitoneal neoplasm. The diagnosis was only histological. The tumour was considered to be high-grade due to its large size, high mitotic index, and the presence of necrosis and liver metastasis. Thorough surveillance revealed several hepatic metastases 29 months after resection, and chemotherapy performed at this stage proved completely ineffective. The patient died 38 months after surgery.
