Intraductal ultrasound in the biliary tract. Although endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) represents a major advance in endoscopic imaging, endosonography using dedicated echoendoscopes has some serious drawbacks, including the diameter of the echoendoscope (12 to 13 mm), the lack of intraluminal examination of the pancreatobiliary duct system due to the size of the instrument, unsatisfactory image quality and resolution for small lesions, and the need for a second examination separate from the previous routine endoscopy. Recently developed ultrasonographic miniprobes (diameter, about 2 mm frequency, 12 to 20 MHz) can be passed through the working channel of standard endoscopes to provide high-frequency ultrasound images. These miniprobes may overcome some of the noted drawbacks and add to the safety and convenience of patients. Moreover, in various diseases of the gastrointestinal tract and the pancreatobiliary ductal system, the diagnostic accuracy of miniprobe ultrasonography has been proven to be superior to that of EUS. Miniprobe ultrasonography is a promising tool that adds new capabilities to the armamentarium of gastroenterologic diagnostic assessment.
