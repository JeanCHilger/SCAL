Examination of intra-gastrointestinal tract signal elimination in MRCP: combined use of T(1)-shortening positive contrast agent and single-shot fast inversion recovery. To examine the effects of removing the gastrointestinal signal in MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), investigations were carried out on the combined use of T(1)-shortening intestine-positive contrast medium, FerriSeltz with ferric ammonium citrate as the main component, and high-speed imaging using single-shot fast inversion recovery (SSFIR). The contrast effect was significantly elevated to 10.2 +/- 1.6 after administration, compared with 5.9 +/- 2.4 before administration (P < 0.001). The enhancement effect was also significantly elevated to 13.2 +/- 3.0 after administration, compared with 4.9 +/- 3.1 before administration (P < 0.001). These results were obtained because the null point of FerriSeltz aqueous solution (5.97 mmol/L) was in the range of approximately 180 msec. With the present method, adequate suppression of the signal intensity of the digestive tract was obtained relatively easily with MRCP, and the technique was found to be effective. J. Magn. Reson.
