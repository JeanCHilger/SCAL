Detection and tumor staging of malignancy in cystic, intraductal, and solid tumors of the pancreas by EUS. EUS can provide detailed imaging of pancreatic malignancies and direct fine needle aspiration (FNA) of pancreatic masses. The ability of EUS to detect and stage malignancy in cystic and intraductal lesions has not been investigated. Our aim was to determine the sensitivity and specificity of EUS imaging and FNA in detecting and staging of malignancy in solid, cystic, and intraductal lesions of the pancreas.The records of 96 patients (46 solid, 26 cystic, 24 intraductal lesions) who underwent EUS followed by surgical exploration over a 3-year period were reviewed. The accuracy of EUS for detecting and staging malignancy was calculated based on the results of surgery and histology.EUS-guided FNA provided evidence of malignancy in solid, cystic, and ductal lesions with sensitivities of 59.5%, 50%, and 60%, respectively. The accuracy of staging by EUS was significantly less for intraductal lesions (47%), compared with cystic (100%) and solid lesions (85%) (p < 0. 05).EUS can be used to detect malignancy in cystic and intraductal tumors of the pancreas.
