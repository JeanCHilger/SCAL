Pancreas divisum: evaluation with secretin-enhanced magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. The clinical significance of pancreas divisum (PD) remains controversial. Secretin-enhanced magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (S-MRCP) is a noninvasive diagnostic procedure that relies on the dynamic response of the main pancreatic duct (MPD) to secretin stimulation. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of PD and to analyze the dynamic changes of the MPD by using S-MRCP in patients referred for suspected pancreatic diseases before ERCP.MRCP was obtained before and at 30-second intervals over 10 minutes after secretin stimulation in consecutive patients with idiopathic acute pancreatitis (n = 67), persistent hydrolasemia (n = 42), recurrent abdominal pain thought to be of pancreatic origin (n = 48), severe chronic pancreatitis (n = 68), and in a control group (n = 54).Thirty patients (10.8%) had a PD at S-MRCP. Secretin stimulation improved the detection of PD in 23% (7/30). The frequency of PD was not significantly different (p > 0.2) between these groups. The occurrence of an abnormal response at S-MRCP (persistent dilatation of the MPD) did not significantly differ in patients with or without PD (p > 0.4).The frequency of PD did not differ between groups, and the dynamic changes of the MPD during S-MRCP were similar in patients with and without PD.
