Carcinoma arising in the pancreas 17 years after primary excision of a choledochal cysts: report of a case. We report herein the case of a 42-year-old woman in whom a pancreatic carcinoma was found 17 years after excision of a choledochal cyst with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. Although the incidence of biliary carcinoma associated with choledochal cyst is high, reports of cancer developing in the remaining intrapancreatic biliary tract or pancreas in patients who have previously undergone primary excision of a choledochal cyst are extremely rare. Long-term follow-up is recommended even for patients who have undergone excisional surgery for a choledochal cyst, in consideration of the possibility that cancer associated with the intrapancreatic biliary tract or pancreas may develop.
