Hepatobiliary and pancreatic complications of ascariasis in children: a study of seven cases. This study presents seven cases of severe hepatobiliary and pancreatic complications of ascariasis in children. The authors describe the clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings, as well as the patients' clinical evolution.These cases were studied within a period of approximately 1 year and included children younger than 11 years (mean age, 4.4 years). The authors reviewed their medical history and evaluated the results of their main diagnostic examinations.All of the patients had vomiting, abdominal pain, pallor, and abdominal distension at presentation. Passage of Ascaris lumbricoides in stool occurred in five cases, emesis with worms in three, fever in three, and hepatomegaly in two. Five patients had pancreatitis, of which two were necrohemorrhagic and one had pseudocyst of the pancreas. In three patients, A. lumbricoides was present in the pancreatic duct. Two patients had hepatic abscess (28.6%), and one of them also had cholangitis. One of the patients with pancreatitis also had signs of cholecystitis at presentation.Ultrasonography was the imaging diagnostic method of choice and demonstrated the presence of A. lumbricoides in the biliary and the pancreatic ducts, as well as signs of pancreatitis, cholecystitis, and hepatic abscess. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, used to confirm the diagnosis, was a fundamental procedure in the treatment, allowing the removal of worms from the biliary duct in four of seven patients.
