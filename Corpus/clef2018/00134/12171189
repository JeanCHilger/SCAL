MR angiography of the mesenteric vasculature. MRA has evolved from a research tool to a robust clinical diagnostic modality. In many centers worldwide, it is the technique of choice for evaluating patients with suspected CMI, assessing operability of patients with pancreatic cancer, and investigating the portal system. Evolving indications include the assessment of liver transplant patients before and after transplant and of living related liver transplant donors. The search for the bleeding source in patients with gastrointestinal hemorrhage may be an indication in the future, once intravascular contrast agents become available.
