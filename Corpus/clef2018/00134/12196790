Use of a phased vector array US catheter for EUS. Existing EUS catheter probes have limited depth of penetration and lack color flow and Doppler capabilities. This study prospectively assessed the feasibility and safety of using a phased vector array US catheter in the human GI tract.Eleven patients underwent EUS with a steerable 9F phased vector array catheter. Images obtained with the catheter were compared with standard EUS images.The GI wall layers were equally well imaged with the catheter compared with standard echoendoscopes in 90% of the cases. Images of the liver, spleen, pancreatic parenchyma, and pancreatic duct were of equal quality and resolution with both techniques in the majority of patients. Some deeper structures and blood vessels were better visualized with the catheter. No complications were encountered.The steerable phased vector array US catheter is a safe device when used in the GI tract and offers images comparable with those obtained with a dedicated echoendoscope. Further studies are needed to determine the accuracy of tumor staging and clinical utility of this device.
