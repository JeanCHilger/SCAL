Sonographic detection of a "VIPoma" in a small child with intractable gastroenteritis. As case report we describe a rare cause of intractable "gastroenteritis" detected by ultrasonography. The 14 months-old boy was admitted to hospital because of intensive dehydration due to massive vomiting and diarrhoea. A salmonella enteritis with intractable hyponatraemia and hypokalaemia was thought to be the cause. After a dramatic relapse during oral treatment measures, further extensive laboratory tests finally disclosed an elevated serum level of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide ("VIP"). The VIP secreting tumor ("VIPoma") was detected ultrasonographically in a retroperitoneal localization mediocaudally of the right kidney. Diffuse distinct calcifications and an increased perfusion could be demonstrated. Intraspinal tumour spread was excluded by magnetic resonance imaging. After complete surgical removal of the tumour the clinical symptomatology normalized promptly and permanently. A VIP-excreting ganglioneuroblastoma with low grade growth fraction ("VIPoma") was diagnosed histologically. Common gastroenteritis in childhood represents no indication for ultrasound. In cases of unclear and therapy-resistant symptomatology, however, diagnostic work-up should include ultrasonography to search for retroperitoneal or pancreatic VIP-excreting tumours.
