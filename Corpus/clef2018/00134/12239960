Management of cystic neoplasms of the pancreas. Despite the growing interest in cystic neoplasms of the pancreas, their diagnosis, treatment and prognosis are still obscure and controversial.We studied, from September 1989 to July 1999, 21 patients (18 women) with an average age of 54.3 years who were submitted to surgical treatment for cystic neoplasms of the pancreas. Ultrasonography and computed tomography were performed in all patients.The treatment performed was surgical resection: cephalic gastroduodenopancreatectomy, 4 patients body and tail pancreatectomy, 11 patientsPatients who present pancreatic cystic lesions should be submitted to surgery when local and medical conditions allow it and when intraoperative frozen biopsy excludes a pancreatic pseudocyst. If the nature of the lesion cannot be determined, it is better to err resecting a pseudocyst than by leaving or draining a cystic neoplasm, since these lesions are potentially curable.
