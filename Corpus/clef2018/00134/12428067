Helicobacter species are not detectable by 16S rDNA PCR in bile from Dutch patients with common bile duct stones. Some Helicobacter species colonize the intestinal tract. To explore the possible relation between Helicobacter spp. and gallbladder disorders, we have investigated their presence in bile of patients with biliary obstruction and dilatation of the bile ducts.Bile was sampled from 31 Dutch patients with biliary obstruction identified by jaundice and dilatation of the bile ducts on ultrasound. Samples (n = 31) were obtained immediately following cannulation of the common bile duct (CBD) by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) (n = 29) or by peri-operative puncture of the gallbladder (n = 2). DNA was isolated from bile by binding to diatoms. Helicobacter spp. were detected by a sensitive (detection limit 1 CFU per reaction tube) 16S rDNA PCR with genus-specific primers. Duplicate samples were spiked with Helicobacter pylori DNA and subjected to PCR in order to check for inhibition.28 patients had CBD stones (bile collected by ERCP (n = 26) or operatively (n = 2)), 2 had a pancreatic head tumor, and in 1 no abnormalities were found. In 1 of 21 amplifiable bile samples (10/31 inhibited) from Dutch patients with CBD stones, H. pylori 16S rDNA was found.Our data indicate that CBD stones in Dutch patients are not associated with the presence of Helicobacter spp. in bile.
