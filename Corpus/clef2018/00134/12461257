Neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas in von Hippel-Lindau disease: spectrum of appearances at CT and MR imaging with histopathologic comparison. To demonstrate the imaging characteristics of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of the pancreas in patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease to establish diagnostic criteria.Twenty-five patients with VHL disease and 29 surgically confirmed pancreatic NETs were included. Screening computed tomographic (CT) and/or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings were reviewed, and tumor number, diameter, growth rates (doubling time), location, presence of metastatic disease, and attenuation or enhancement properties were determined.Eighteen of 29 (62%) pancreatic NETs were smaller than 3.0 cm in diameter and enhanced homogeneously on contrast material-enhanced CT and MR images. No tumor smaller than 3.0 cm metastasized. Tumors 3.0 cm or larger (11 [38%] of 29) more often enhanced heterogeneously, and two of 11 were associated with hepatic metastases. Smaller (<3.0 cm) tumors displayed longer mean doubling times (mean, 927 vs 351 days) than did larger (> or =3.0 cm) tumors however, there was considerable overlap. Fifteen (52%) tumors were located in the pancreatic headPancreatic NETs in VHL have characteristic features at CT and MR imaging: Most are small, located in the pancreatic head, and enhance homogeneously. Tumors larger than 3.0 cm are prone to metastasize and enhance heterogeneously.
