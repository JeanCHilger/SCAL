Pancreatic tuberculosis. A 63-year-old Japanese man visited our institute with fever of unknown origin. Findings on preoperative imaging modalities were consistent with pancreatic carcinoma, but a positive tuberculin skin test indicated tuberculosis infection. Negative results for MycobacteriumDNA polymerase chain reaction from sputum and bone-marrow aspiration biopsy specimens ruled out pulmonary and miliary tuberculosis, respectively. Positron emission tomography (PET) with 2-[fluorine-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy- d-glucose (FDG) showed multiple labeled spots within the pancreas body and chest. Distal pancreatectomy was performed with a diagnosis of suspected pancreatic carcinoma, but the histological and microbiological diagnosis was Mycobacterium infection. A rare case of pancreatic tuberculosis evaluated by FDG PET is reported and discussed herein.
