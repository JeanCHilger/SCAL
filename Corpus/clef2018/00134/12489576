Functional MRCP in pancreatic and periampullary disease. The magnetic resonance (MR) evaluation of the pancreatic and biliary tree has undergone an important evolution because the introduction of the technique of MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP).To describe and illustrate the technique of secretin-enhanced MRCP (S-MRCP) and discuss its use in pancreatic and periampullary disease.Results are based on 6 years experience using MRCP with secretin infusion in hundreds of patients in a tertiary referral center.Secretin improves pancreatic duct and side-branch delineation and the detection of anatomic variants such as pancreas divisum and abnormal common bilio-pancreatic channel. It allows monitoring of pancreatic flow dynamics and evaluation of pancreatic exocrine function that has been previously unavailable. In advanced inflammatory disease, it is useful in monitoring the course of the disease, for planning therapy and for follow-up studies after therapeutic endoscopy.Combining morphology and function into one non-invasive and comprehensive diagnostic modality has expanded the clinical applications of MRCP beyond the diagnostic ERCP that it replaces.
