Magnetic resonance imaging of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be considered essential to the presurgical evaluation of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, to accurately detect resectable lesions and to spare patients with non-resectable tumors the morbidity, mortality, and expense of unnecessary surgery. This article is a review of the MRI characteristics of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, the features that determine its resectability, and the optimal MR sequences needed for its effective evaluation. The role of MRI imaging is contrasted with other imaging and invasive modalities for the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
