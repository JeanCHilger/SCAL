Virtual surgeries based on spiral computed tomography. Experience of spiral computed tomography with bolus contrast enhancement and subsequent 3D-reconstruction of picture for virtual modeling of surgeries is presented. The method was used in 204 patients with tumors and diseases of the liver, pancreas, spleen, kidneys, adrenal glands, parapapillary diverticula of the duodenum, coarctations and aneurysms of aorta, extraorganic tumors of the retroperitoneal cavity and neck. Coincidence of virtual and real types of surgeries reached 75-92.8% depending on the disease and clinical situation. Perspectives of 3D-reconstruction for evaluation of normal and pathologic anatomic features in an individual patient, choice of an optimal surgical variant, prognosis of possible complications and their prophylaxis are demonstrated. Integration of surgeon's and radiologist's thinking is very important for correct diagnosis and surgical policy.
