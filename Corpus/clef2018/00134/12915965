Neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas. The benefits of associating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and laparoscopy for localizing and treating neuroendocrine pancreatic tumors (NEPTs) have been poorly documented.In a retrospective study, eight patients with a mean age of 48 years were operated on for a NEPT. MRI was used to localize the lesions. In all patients a laparoscopic resection was carried out. Laparoscopic ultrasonography (LUS) was used during most operations.The tumor was clearly localized by MRI in seven patients, and LUS showed the lesion in another patient whose preoperative MRI had been unsuitable. Three enucleations, three spleen-preserving caudal pancreatectomies, and two caudal pancreatectomies with splenectomy were carried out. There were no conversions and the mean operating time was 260 min, with a mean blood loss of 180 ml. The mean hospital stay was 7 days. There were no minor nor major complications during the hospitalization period. However, a pancreatic abscess was diagnosed in one patient 1 month later, requiring an urgent laparotomy.MRI as well as LUS are indeed suitable techniques to localize NEPTs. Moreover, the minimally invasive approach ensured an adequate treatment with a more comfortable and short postoperative recovery.
