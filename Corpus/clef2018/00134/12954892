Discrimination of unilocular macrocystic serous cystadenoma from pancreatic pseudocyst and mucinous cystadenoma with CT: initial observations. To compare the computed tomographic (CT) appearance of pancreatic unilocular macrocystic serous cystadenoma, mucinous cystadenoma, and pseudocyst to determine if there are findings that assist in the differential diagnosis.CT findings in 33 patients (24 women, nine men age range, 18-84 yearsThree of four CT findings were independently specific for macrocystic serous cystadenoma: location in the pancreatic head, lobulated contour, and absence of wall enhancement. When two of these four criteria were used in combination, 83% (10 of 12) of patients with unilocular macrocystic serous cystadenoma were identified. When three or four of these criteria were used, a specificity of 100% was achieved. Location in the pancreatic head (P <.05), lobulated contour (P <.005), and lack of wall enhancement (P <.005) were specific for macrocystic serous cystadenoma in comparison with mucinous cystic tumor. Lobulated contours (P <.005) were specific for macrocystic serous cystadenoma in comparison with pseudocyst. Other CT findings were not helpful in distinguishing between the three types of lesions.A combination of CT findings is helpful in making the diagnosis of pancreatic unilocular macrocystic serous cystadenoma.
