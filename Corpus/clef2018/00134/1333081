Solitary pancreatic metastasis of malignant fibrous histiocytoma treated by distal pancreatectomy. A tumor in the body of the pancreas was detected in a 31-year-old man who had undergone a resection of a malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) of the left distal femur 2 years before. The patient underwent a distal pancreatectomy with regional lymph node dissection. The surgical specimen revealed MFH metastatic to the pancreas. He is alive without recurrence or metastasis at 1 year after pancreatectomy. This case seems to be the first report of successfully resected pancreatic metastasis of a malignant fibrous histiocytoma in the published literature, as far as we can determine.
