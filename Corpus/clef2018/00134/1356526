A case of duodenal carcinoma presenting as a submucosal tumor. This paper describes a patient with duodenal carcinoma showing the features of a submucosal tumor, leading to difficulty in making an accurate preoperative diagnosis. A 63-year-old woman was admitted for investigation of a duodenal mass. An examination of the upper gastrointestinal tract revealed a semicircular compression of the stomach and the duodenum. Endoscopy of the stomach and duodenum disclosed a hemispherical tumor with a deep ulcer in the apex. Computer tomography revealed a tumor of about 5 cm in diameter at the same site. Laparotomy was performed under the tentative diagnosis of a submucosal tumor. A tumor was found occupying the duodenum, which compressed the gastric antrum exteriorly, and was also adherent to the head of the pancreas by direct invasion. A curative resection was performed by combining a pancreatoduodenectomy with a transverse colectomy along with regional lymph node clearance. A microscopic examination showed that the tumor contained neoplastic cells growing in a tubular pattern, particularly in its peripheral regions. Thus, this lesion was finally diagnosed as primary adenocarcinoma of the duodenum.
