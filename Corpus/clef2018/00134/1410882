The glucagonoma syndrome. 3 new cases. We report three new cases of glucagonoma revealed, 6 to 12 months after its onset, by non-specific and misleading skin lesions associated in all 3 cases with diabetes mellitus, severe deterioration of the general condition and hyperglucagonaemia. Non-invasive methods, such as ultrasonography and computerized tomography (CT), are most helpful to locate the pancreatic tumour. Phlebography with tiered venous blood sampling is useful in difficult cases. A false positive result has been recorded with arteriography. Ultrasonography and CT have yielded two false negative results. The alpha-chain of the chorionic gonadotrophin hormone has limited value in the diagnosis of malignant glucagonoma. Treatment is surgical, but despite it, the prognosis is severe (two of our three patients died), due to the risk of thromboembolism, to cachexia and to metastases that are frequent at the time of diagnosis.
