Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration. A cytopathologist's perspective. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is used to detect and delineate the extent of lesions in the gastrointestinal tract, periluminal lymph nodes, pancreas and hepatobiliary tree, left kidney, spleen, and adrenal glands. EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) has added a new dimension to the capabilities of EUS because it permits characterization of the lesion, thereby enabling triage of patients for more efficient and effective management. This review focuses on the advantages and limitations of EUS-FNA, including a discussion of potential pitfalls in the diagnosis of commonly aspirated deep-seated lesions, such as those of the pancreas and lymph nodes. It also addresses the practical considerations associated with establishing an effective service and the importance of an integrated approach in which the cytopathologist undertakes a key role, interacting extensively with the endoscopist and the patient management team. EUS-FNA is a sensitive modality that enables specific and accurate diagnosis of deep-seated lesions. Samples can be obtained effectively from small lesions (< 25 mm), irrespective of the organ site. On-site assessment permits a highly accurate preliminary diagnosis of malignancy for samples obtained by EUS-FNA and provides an opportunity to increase the diagnostic yield of samples.
