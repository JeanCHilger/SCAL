Serous cystadenoma of the pancreas in a child. Pancreatic tumors are very rare in children. Until now, approximately 150 cases have been reported in the English-language medical literature. Only 4 of them represented serous cystadenoma. Although the tumor is not potentially malignant, all patients required partial pancreatic resection. The authors present a 4-year-old girl with a short history of abdominal pain and vomiting. Sonography and computed tomography showed a pancreatic mass. The mass was proved to be a serous cystadenoma, and resection of the tumor was performed. Clinical discussion with review of the literature is presented.
