Management of branch duct-type intraductal papillary mucinous tumor of the pancreas based on magnetic resonance imaging. We assessed the usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in identifying nonmalignant intraductal papillary mucinous tumors (IPMTs) of the pancreas.Thirty-three patients with branch duct-type IPMT diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography were prospectively examined with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography followed by dynamic gadolinium-enhanced MRI examinations, and patients with no findings suggestive of malignancy, including a solid mass, mural nodules, a main pancreatic duct wider than 5 mm in diameter, and stenosis of the main pancreatic duct, were prospectively followed up with sequential MRI examinations once or twice a year.Twenty-six (79%) patients showed no findings suggestive of malignancy in the initial MRI examination. The diameter (mean +/- standard error) of the main pancreatic duct was 3.9 +/- 0.7 mm and that of the ectatic branch pancreatic duct was 36.0 +/- 9.1 mm. Twenty-three patients were prospectively followed for more than 36 months and 22 of them showed no findings suggestive of malignancy during follow-up periods ranging from 39 to 77 months (mean = 55 months).MRI was useful to identify nonmalignant IPMTs of the branch duct type, and close follow-up observation with serial MRI examinations may be appropriate in the management of such patients.
