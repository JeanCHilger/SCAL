Imaging diagnosis of mucinous cystic neoplasms of the pancreas. To assess the imaging findings in mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs) of the pancreas.The imaging manifestations of 18 cases with pathologically proven MCNs were analyzed retrospectively.The cystic features of MCNs could be demonstrated by ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Compared with US, CT and MRI are appropriate for localizing diagnosis (100%). One half of the cases have classic imaging findings of the MCNs, where as the diagnosis of remaining cases could be supported by clinical findings.Imaging technique plays an important role in the diagnosis of MCNs.
