Granulocytic sarcoma of the pancreas. A report of one case and review of the literature. Granulocytic sarcoma is an extramedullary collection of myeloblasts. Granulocytic sarcomas usually arise during the course of acute myeloid leukemia, although they also occur infrequently in chronic myeloid leukemia and other myeloproliferative disorders. We are reporting a very unusual presentation of granulocytic sarcoma in a patient with poorly differentiated (FAB type M2) acute myeloid leukemia. The patient was in complete remission from leukemia when he presented obstructive jaundice due to a pancreatic mass consisting of myeloblasts. A literature search identified only five previously reported cases of granulocytic sarcoma of the pancreas. Those cases are also reviewed here with emphasis on their clinical characteristics, diagnostic approaches, and management of this interesting and challenging entity.
