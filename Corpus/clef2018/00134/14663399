Groove pancreatitis. Diagnostic impact of dynamic radiology. Described by Becker in 1973, groove pancreatitis is a rare segmental chronic pancreatitis affecting the groove between the head of the pancreas, the duodenum and the common bile duct. Mimicking pancreatic head carcinoma, surgical exploration is often required.Diagnosis of groove pancreatitis was made on computed tomography and MR imaging (groove fibrosis) in a 58 year-old man presenting with acute pancreatitis complicated by bilary and duodenal stenosis, with totally favourable outcome within 5 months with conservative treatment.After a general presentation, characterization of fibrosis of the groove by dynamic CT and MR imaging is emphasized (delayed enhancement of collagen fibrous tissue during the late post-equilibrium phase) and may, in the absence of complications, avoid surgical exploration.Improved radiological characterization of fibrosis helps the diagnosis of this particular form of pancreatitis, in which surgical treatment is not always ineluctable.
