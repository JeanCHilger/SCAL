Body and distal pancreatectomy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma: case report and review of the literature. Renal cell carcinoma is known for its unpredictable behavior. Spontaneous regression of metastatic disease has been reported and patients have been known to survive for years with metastatic disease. Reports of long intervals between nephrectomy and metastatic disease are common. We present a case of a solitary metastasis to the pancreas 20 years after nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma.
