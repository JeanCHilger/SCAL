Endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration biopsy in the diagnosis of pancreatic masses. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) represents a highly sensitive method for the detection of pancreatic masses. When available, EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) is the best technique for the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic cancer due to its ability to obtain tissue for diagnosis. The standardized indications for pancreatic EUS-FNA comprise the definite diagnosis of malignancy and histopathological confirmation of adenocarcinoma before surgical resection, chemo/radiotherapy, or celiac plexus neurolysis. The technique of performing EUS-FNA is described in detail, from the vizualization of the target lesion and adequate placement of the transducer to allow optimal needle access, to needle penetration and sampling of the targeted lesion. We report a series of 9 patients who underwent EUS-FNA and shortly review the indications, technique, results and impact of EUS-FNA on the management of these patients.
