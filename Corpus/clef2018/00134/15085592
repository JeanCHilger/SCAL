Diagnostic value of secretin-enhanced magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (S-MRCP) after unsuccessful endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). To evaluate the value of S-MRCP in patients in whom ERCP performed by experts in a tertiary center were unsuccessful.From January 2000 to June 2003, 22 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The indications for ERCP were obstructive jaundice (n = 9), abnormal liver enzymes (n = 8), suspected chronic pancreatitis (n = 2), recurrent pancreatitis (n = 2) or suspected pancreatic cancer (n = 1). The reasons for the ERCP failure were postsurgical anatomy (n = 7), duodenum stenosis (n = 3), duodenal diverticulum (n = 2), or technical failure (n = 10). MRCP images were evaluated before and 5 and 10 min after the i.v. administration of 0.5 IU/kg secretin.The MRCP images were diagnostic in all but 1 patient. Five patients gave normal MR fadings and required no further intervention. S-MRCP detected abnormalities (primary sclerosing cholangitis, chronic pancreatitis, cholangitis, cholecystolithiasis or common bile duct dilatation) in 10 patients, who were followed up clinically. Four patients subsequently underwent laparotomy (hepatico-jejunostomy owing to common bile duct stenosis caused by unresectable pancreatic cancer hepaticotomy + Kehr drainage because of narrow biliary-enteric anastomosisS-MRCP is the method of choice in cases where ERCP is not possible.
