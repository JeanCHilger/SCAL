An isolated complete pancreatic fracture primarily diagnosed by ultrasound. Pancreatic fractures due to blunt abdominal trauma are rare and are usually symptom-free and silent in many cases. Therefore, a high degree of suspicion is required either early in the course of trauma or later during follow-up. Computed tomography (CT) is the primary imaging modality for the diagnosis of traumatic pancreatic injuries. In this report, we present a 10-year-old child in whom ultrasound enabled the detection of a complete fracture between the body and tail of the pancreas, while initial CT findings were not suggestive of a lesion. The need for ultrasonography is emphasized especially in the presence of a history of trauma even if CT scans appear normal.
