Aberrant pancreas: report of five cases. We herein report five cases of heterotopic pancreas localized on common bile duct, gastric antrum, duodenum (two cases including one with cystic dystrophy), and jejunum. The choledocal localization was revealed by jaundice. The duodenal localization with cystic, diagnosed by endoscopic ultrasound, was revealed by onsets of acute pancreatitis. All localizations were treated by resection: antrectomy, bowel resection, and pancreaticoduodenectomy. Postoperative course was uneventful. Review of the literature shows that, even in uncomplicated cases, resection is usually performed.
