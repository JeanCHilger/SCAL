Preaortic paraganglioma mimicking a hypervascular tumor of the pancreas. Paragangliomas are rare tumors that arise from neuroepithelial cells. They are most frequently located in the para-aortic region and they may be confused with other retroperitoneal tumors, especially pancreatic tumors. We present a case of a secreting preaortic paraganglioma in a young patient which was mimicking a hypervascular tumor of the pancreas, and that was completely resected 5 years after the failure of a first attempt to remove the tumor.
