Glucagonoma and pseudoglucagonoma syndrome. Glucagonoma syndrome may present either associated with a pancreatic neoplasm which secretes glucagon or as a pseudo-glucagonoma associated with other diseases. It is extremely infrequent but well-known with a current prevalence estimated at 1/20,000,000.A retrospective review of glucagonoma and pseudoglucagonoma cases observed between January 1998 and December 2003 in three hospitals.Five cases: 3 with a demonstrable glucagon-secreting tumor and 2 cases without an associated neoplasm.Age, sex, initial diagnosis, associated symptoms, and pathology were analyzed as were procedures employed in diagnosis, imaging studies, laboratory data, surgery and follow-up.Hyperglycemia and elevated plasma glucagon levels were found in all cases. In 3 cases, hypo-aminoacidemia and a descrease in fatty acids were found. No changes of zinc levels were observed. Abdominal ultrasound studies were of no value except in evaluating pancreatitis. A CT-scan was conclusive when a pancreatic neoplasm existed and 3 patients were operated on a curative basis.Necrolytic migratory erythema was the key diagnosis in all cases. Surgery was intended to be curative. The follow-up was of 8, 37 and 57 months in the cases of true glucagonoma syndrome.A real prevalence of glucagonoma syndrome could be greater than currently estimated. In our series, it was 13.5/20,000,000. Pseudoglucagonoma syndrome remains a rarity.
