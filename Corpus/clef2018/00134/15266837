Diagnosis and surgical treatment of solid-pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas. To study the diagnosis and treatment of solid-pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas (SPTP).The clinical course, surgical treatment, and pathological findings of 13 patients with SPTP were analyzed.SPTP has no specific clinical symptoms. The patients mostly have abdominal pain and space occupying symptoms. Laboratory investigations of some patients showed decreased pancreatic exocrine function and elevated CA242 of tumor markers. Ultrasonography and CT revealed large solid cystic tumor of pancreas. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) showed lacked-blood-supply space occupying lesion. All tumors were resected successfully. The histological findings showed a large encapsulated tumor and the section of tumor surrounded by hemorrhagic and necrotic areas. The solid areas are composed of small and medium size tumor cells, which had no obvious atypia. Psudopapillary structures were found in the cystic degeneration areas. Immunohistochemically, most of the tumors were positive for alpha-antitrypsin (alpha-AT) and vimentin and negative for chromogrannin. No patients recurrence during the follow-up.Most of SPTP can be removed successfully after diagnosis. The tumor and local infiltration tissue should be removed completely, and the long-term prognosis of SPTP is good.
