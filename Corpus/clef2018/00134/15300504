Biliary infarction mimicking liver metastasis. A 38-year-old man with a history of chronic alcohol abuse had suffered from numerous acute episodes of chronic pancreatitis in the last 7 years. Those episodes were complicated by the formation of a pseudocyst in the pancreatic head. He presented himself with vomiting and abdominal pain as well as diarrhoea for 10 days. In the ultrasound examination of the liver numerous circumscribed hypoechoic formations in both lobes of the liver were found. A subsequent computerised tomography scan confirmed multiple hypodense liver lesions. Because of suspected metastasis or abscesses in the liver, sonographically guided fine needle biopsies of these liver structures were carried out. The histological examination of the liver specimens showed bile infarcts and proliferated bile ducts there were no signs of a malignant or infectious process. The bacteriological cultures of the biopsy specimens were negative.
