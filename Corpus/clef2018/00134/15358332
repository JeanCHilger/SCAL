Clinical characteristics, treatment, and outcome of pancreatic Schwannomas. This article involves the study of a patient with a rare benign schwannoma in the body of the pancreas. After reviewing 39 patient cases previously reported in the literature, a discussion of the schwannoma with regard to clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment is examined. A review of the patient's chart was performed along with a review of the literature using a Medline search. Translations were performed whenever necessary. There are 23 reports of 29 patient cases of pancreatic schwannomas in English and European literature and one report of 10 patient cases in the Japanese literature. The mean age was 57.75 years (range 32-89) and the male-to-female (M:F) ratio was 17:23. The mean reported size was 8.79 cm. The lesion was located in the head in 16 patients (40%), the body in 8 patients (20%), the body and tail in 8 patients (20%), the tail in 6 patients (15%), the head and body in 1 patient (2.5%), and the location was not specified in 1 patient (2.5%). Of the English and European patients, 11 out of 30 patients (36.7%) exhibited solid tumors and 14 out of 30 patients (46.7%) exhibited cystic tumors. The majority of the tumors (35 out of 40) were benign, but there were five reported malignancies. There were no deaths or recurrences reported with a follow-up of 18.68 months +/- 24.09 (range 3-108 months). Pancreatic schwannomas are rare, and the preoperative diagnosis is difficult. Intraoperative frozen section can confirm the diagnosis of a benign schwannoma. Enucleation of the tumor from the surrounding parenchyma is recommended, if possible. Patients undergoing resection indicate an excellent long-term prognosis.
