Insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function in protease inhibitor-treated and -naive human immunodeficiency virus-infected children. Previous pediatric studies have failed to demonstrate a clear association between protease inhibitor (PI) therapy and abnormal glucose homeostasis in HIV-infected children. To define more precisely the impact of PI therapy on glucose homeostasis in this population, we performed the insulin-modified frequent-sampling iv glucose tolerance test on 33 PI-treated and 15 PI-naive HIV-infected children. Other investigations included fasting serum lipids glucose, insulin, and C-peptide
