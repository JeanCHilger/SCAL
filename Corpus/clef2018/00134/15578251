The value of imaging techniques in the staging of pancreatic cancer. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical value of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in the staging of pancreatic carcinoma and to compare it to ultrasonography (US) and CT.We evaluated 45 patients (21 women and 24 men with a mean age of 62.1 years) who had undergone surgical treatment for pancreatic cancer between 1994 and 2004. Out analysis focused on the overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of routine and Doppler US, CT, and EUS.Endoscopic ultrasound was the most accurate modality for local tumor staging (93.1%), vascular infiltration (90%), and lymph node assessment (87.5%). Routine US was the least accurate (82.5%, 67.5%, and 72.5%, respectively). The accuracy rates for CT and Doppler US were similar (88.1%, 82.5% and 80.0%, respectively).Endoscopic ultrasound is the most accurate method available to stage pancreatic cancer in the preoperative period. However, the advantage of EUS over CT and US does not justify its routine use due to its high cost, low availability, and invasiveness.
