Acute necrotizing pancreatitis--diagnostic and treatment strategy. Despite of the current achievements of medicine, the mortality of necrotizing pancreatitis (NP) is still too high--up to 35-40% and stands as a serious diagnostic and treatment problem. The results of treatment of 148 patients, admitted in the clinic with diagnosis NP, 95 males and 53 females, are discussed. The ratio between patients with acute oedematic and acute NP is 81.1% to 18.9%. According to the hystopatology findings, the results are as follows: pancreatic necrosis--128 patients, peripancreatic necrosis--42 patients, retropancreatic necrosis--29 patients, phlegmonous cholecystitis--31 patients. For the exact diagnostic estimation of the development and prognosis of NP, we are based on: Clinic symptomatology, biochemical constellations (the prognostic scale of Ranson), ultrasonography, CT, ERCP, ES, laparoscopy (48 pts), and laparoscopic drainage (34 pts) of the abdominal cavity with one or two drains, in order to decrease the intoxication and manage intraperitoneal irrigation with antibiotics and enzymes. The operative intervations consists of a thorough exploration, broad necrectomy combined with lavage and large drainage. COLD (controlled open lesser sac drainage) has been performed at 34 cases. In 31 pts cholecystectomy and choledochotomy with T-tube drainage of d. choledochus (Kehr drainage) was performed. Reoperations have been made at 34 pts (22.9%) in 11 of them--2 operative revisions have been carried out, in 3 cases--three, and in 3 cases--4 operative revisions were performed. The total postoperative death rate was 21.6% (32 patients). The most common postoperative complications were as follows: pulmonary complications at 11 cases, pleural effusions--9 pts, intraabdominal abscesses--6 patients, postnecrotic pseudocysts--9 cases, pancreatic fistulas--6 cases, fistulas of the colon--2 pts, bleeding--4 patients.
