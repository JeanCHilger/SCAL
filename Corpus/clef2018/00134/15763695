Imaging and localization of islet-cell tumours of the pancreas on CT and MRI. Islet-cell tumours are neuroendocrine tumours that arise from the endocrine pancreas. They may be associated with a variety of syndromes and are subclassified into functioning and non-functioning tumours. They range from benign to malignant. They demonstrate characteristic features when imaged with both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Sensitivity and specificity, as well as detection of extrapancreatic extension, are generally superior with MRI. However, CT is currently still more readily available to patients. Multiphase, post-contrast series are commended for the evaluation of islet-cell tumours with either modality.
