Pancreatic adenocarcinoma: the different CT criteria for peripancreatic major arterial and venous invasion. To establish preliminarily the different diagnostic criteria for peripancreatic arterial and venous invasion in pancreatic carcinoma by comparing their multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT) appearances with surgical exploration.Among 101 patients with pancreatic carcinoma examined by MDCT, 54 candidates accepting surgery were preoperatively evaluated for vascular invasion based on CT signs (A-E): arterial embedment in tumor or venous obliteration tumor involvement exceeding one-half of the circumference of the vesselDuring surgical exploration, 78 vessels were found to be invaded. With sign A (B, C, or D) as the CT criterion for peripancreatic vascular invasion, the sensitivity of arterial and venous invasion was 66% (97%, 45%, or 41%) and 14% (49%, 63%, or 55%), respectively the specificity of absence of arterial and venous invasion was 100% (91%, 99%, or 100%) and 100% (all 100%). In this study, there were 3 SMVs appearing teardrop (sign E), which were all confirmed to be invaded.It is recommended that the CT diagnostic criteria for arterial and venous invasion should be dealt with differently. The criteria of arterial invasion are the presence of sign A or the combination of sign B with one of signs C and D. The criteria of venous invasion are the presence of one of the following signs: sign A, sign B, sign C, sign D, and sign E.
