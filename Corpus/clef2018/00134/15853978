Carcinoid of the ampulla of Vater. Endocrine neoplasms only rarely occur at the ampulla of Vater, comprising mostly carcinoids and malignant carcinoids, as well as few cases of poorly differentiated endocrine carcinomas (small cell carcinomas). Only 105 cases are reported in the literature, most as single case reports. For many years, the neoplasms of the disseminated neuroendocrine cell system of the gastrointestinal tract have been subsumed as 'carcinoids'. Instead, in the latest World Health Organization (WHO) classification published in 2000, it is recommended to distinguish between (i) well-differentiated endocrine tumors (carcinoids) (ii) well-differentiated endocrine carcinomas (malignant carcinoids)
