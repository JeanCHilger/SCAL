Symptomatic mesentery Castleman disease mimicking a pancreatic tumor. Castleman disease (CD) is an uncommon lymphoproliferative disorder of unknown etiology. It can be localized or multicentric. There are two major histological variants. The hyaline-vascular type predominates in the thorax and the mesenteric disease is usually of the plasma cell type. Hyaline-vascular CD of the mesentery is very rare. We report such a neoplasm of mesenteric root in a 38-year-old woman who presented with abdominal discomfort. Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of CD has rarely been reported previously. The imaging findings of CD on computed tomograms, MR images and angiograms were described.
