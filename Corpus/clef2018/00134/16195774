Unusual case of skull metastasis secondary to pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Skull metastasis must be kept in mind when considering the differential diagnosis of a skull tumor. Skull metastases cause local swelling that is usually painless, and rarely they lead to neurologic dysfunction. Despite the fact that hematogenous skull metastases can be caused by nearly all types of tumors (lung, prostate, thyroid carcinoma, malignant melanoma), breast cancer is associated with the highest rate of metastatic skull lesions. We report an extremely rare case of skull metastasis from a pancreatic adenocarcinoma, in a 65-year-old woman, presented with painless frontoparietal scalp swelling which developed within three months. To the best of our knowledge, this is the second case involving the skull secondary to a pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and the first case when skull metastasis was the first evidence of a pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
