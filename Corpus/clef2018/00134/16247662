Pancreatic and gastric metastases of leiomyosarcoma arising in the left leg. Pancreatic or gastric metastases from other primary malignancies are rare, especially from leiomyosarcoma. We report a case of leiomyosarcoma in the left lower leg with metastases to the pancreas and stomach. A 61-year-old man had liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis C virus infection and was followed up by his primary physician. Two years before presentation at our hospital, he had undergone surgical resection of leiomyosarcoma in the left lower leg and systemic chemotherapy for multiple metastatic tumors in the lung. On admission, endoscopic examination and computed tomography were performed for a routine checkup to exclude esophageal varices and liver tumor. Although the patient had no specific symptoms, multiple gastric and pancreatic metastases were identified by endoscopy and computed tomography, respectively. In general, metastases to the pancreas and stomach are rare. We discuss the clinical and diagnostic findings of pancreatic and gastric metastases by reviewing previously reported cases.
