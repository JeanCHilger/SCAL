Contrast agents in abdominal imaging: current and future directions. Magnetic resonance imaging is an established imaging method for the evaluation of the abdomen. Accurate assessment of the liver, spleen, pancreas, bile ducts, vascular structures, and retroperitoneal organs (eg, the kidneys, the collecting system, and the adrenals) are possible on MR imaging. The intravenous administration of MR contrast agents can frequently improve the examination and provide more specific diagnoses. The advent of more specific, "hepatobiliary" contrast agents has further improved the differential diagnostic process, particularly for MR imaging of the liver. The availability of orally administered MR contrast agents has further extended the range of abdominal applications, making MR imaging of the small bowel and the colon established imaging procedures.
