A case of advanced pancreatic cancer treated with chemoradiation. A 56-year-old man is presented with diarrhea, which he had experienced since February 2004. He was diagnosed as having advanced pancreatic cancer by enhanced abdominal CT scan in May 2004. He was diagnosed with unresectable pancreatic cancer, and treated with a combination of radiation (3 Gy/day) and injections of gemcitabine (GEM) 1,200 mg/week (800 mg/m2, BSA 1.6). Abdominal CT scan revealed a minor response (tumor diameter 5.7 x 4.8 --> 5.2 x 4.4). Accordingly, the improvement of performance status and reduction in serum levels of arcinoembryonic/carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) were observed. In July 2004, chemotherapy and radiotherapy were switched to GEM+UFT (UFT 360 mg/day, a total of 4,320 mg, GEM 1,200 mg according to the body mass, a total of 2,400 mg). The patient's performance state was stable for 6 months but serum levels of CA19-9 increased from March 2005, and he complained of diarrhea and back-pain. Therefore, the combination chemotherapy with GEM and cisplatin (CDDP) was started in April 2005, but there was no clinical effect. GEM and TS-1 are currently being administered. Pancreatic cancer is one of the worst prognoses of any malignant disease. Although the prognosis of unresectable pancreatic cancer is very poor, we presented a case where performance status and survival benefits were obtained by undergoing chemoradiation with GEM and combination chemotherapy with UFT and GEM.
