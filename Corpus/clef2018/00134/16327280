Interventional endoscopic ultrasound in pancreatic diseases. During the last 15 years, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has become an important imaging procedure for diagnosis and management of pancreatic diseases. The clinical interest of EUS is now enhanced by interventional procedures. Noteworthy, fine-needle aspiration biopsy is one of the most important contributions of EUS, in particular for the investigation of patients with pancreatic cancer and cystic tumors. EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration appears to be a safe and reliable technique to obtain tissue from pancreatic masses with a low risk of complications. EUS became also a therapeutic procedure, especially applied for celiac plexus neurolysis, pseudocyst drainage, and pancreaticogastrostomy. Further developments are expected by improvement of needle devices such as pancreatic pseudocyst drainage kits. In the future, EUS might be also a support for local application of new treatments of pancreatic tumors, such as gene or cellular therapy products. In this review, we discuss the current clinical applications of interventional EUS and the future development for diagnosis and management of pancreatic diseases.
