Changing treatment strategy for gastrinoma in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. We overviewed the recent development of curative surgery for gastrinoma that has been rapidly improved since the development of new localization techniques, especially the selective arterial secretagogue injection test (SASI test) and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS). A number of new pathological findings of gastrinomas in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome have been accumulated in accordance with the increase of curative resection of gastrinomas, and these new findings also have contributed to the progress of the treatment strategy for grastrinomas.
