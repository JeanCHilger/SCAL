Predictors of cancer in patients with suspected pancreatic malignancy without a tissue diagnosis. The aim of this study was to identify predictive factors for malignancy in patients undergoing surgery for suspected pancreatic cancer without a preoperative tissue diagnosis.Patients were identified by International Classification of Diseases Ninth Revision and current procedural terminology codes, respectively, for pancreatic cancer and pancreaticoduodenectomy at a single tertiary referral center between January 1998 and May 2004. Data were collected retrospectively by chart review. Multivariate analysis of potential predictive factors was performed.A total of 150 patients underwent surgery for documented or suspected pancreatic malignancy 102 did not have a preoperative tissue diagnosis of cancer. Of these, 75 had neoplastic disease at surgery. Average weight loss was greater for those with malignancy (13.5 vs. 4.8 lbsIn patients suspected of having a pancreatic malignancy, weight loss, hyperbilirubinemia, and increased CA 19-9 level may be predictive of a final cancer diagnosis. Surgical exploration should be considered in these patients even in the absence of a preoperative tissue diagnosis.
