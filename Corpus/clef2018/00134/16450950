Usefulness of endoscopic ultrasonography for diagnosis between multivesicular hydatic cyst and serous cystadenoma of the pancreas. Case report. Hydatid cyst of the pancreas is very rare. However, it should be suspected in every case of pancreatic cyst, especially in hydatid countries where hydatic cyst disease is endemic. In the paper we report the first case of a multivesicular hydatid cyst of the pancreas explored by endoscopic ultrasonography. Endoscopic ultrasonography is very reliable in the investigation of pancreatic cystic tumors. However it did not allow us to define semiological criteria capable of permitting a differential diagnosis between a hydatid cyst and serous cystadenoma. Per-echoendoscopic transduodenal puncture might improve the efficiency of this procedure with of hydatid cysts of the head of the pancreas.
