Chronic pancreatitis-induced compressed relative stenosis of the distal common bile duct. Fibrosis and enlargement of chronic pancreatitis (CP) can cause biliary stenosis, in which fixed circular stenosis is the common type, by compressing the intrapancreatic portion of the common bile duct. Another type of distal bile duct stenosis is compressed relative stenosis, in which the common bile duct walks along the back of the pancreas partially.Thirty patients with dilation of the proximal common bile duct (diameter > or = 15 mm) caused by CP underwent overall and systemic exploratory operation at our hospital. All of the patients were followed up for 3.5 to 15 years, averaging 8.5 years.The intrapancreatic portion of the common bile duct was found to walk along the back of the pancreas, and its anterior wall was compressed flat by enlarged pancreas, but the posterior wall showed a good flexibility because there was no pancreas covering. Bake's dilators bigger than No.6 (diameter > or = 4 mm) and No.14 urinary catheter could pass through the distal common bile duct after the posterior wall was separated. Roux-en-Y choledochojejunostomy was performed for 4 patients, and T-tube drainage was carried out for the remaining 26 patients. All of the patients were followed up but 2 were lost. Only 2 patients underwent choledochojejunostomy 3 years after T-tube drainage because of repeated acute pancreatitis attack, and others were normal.Compressed relative stenosis of the distal common bile caused by CP is a clinical sign, and its diagnosis mainly depends on surgical findings. Most patients can be treated by separating the posterior wall of the pancreas and T-tube drainage as well, but to patients with recurrent CP, choledochojejunostomy may be a feasible alternative.
