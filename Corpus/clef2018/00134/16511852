Review of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology. This review, based on the Hennepin County Medical Center experience and review of the literature, vastly covers the up-to-date role of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) in evaluating tumorous lesions of the gastrointestinal tract and adjacent organs. Emphasis is given to the tumoral and nodal staging of esophageal, pulmonary, and pancreatic cancer. This review also discusses technical, pathological, and gastroenterologic aspects and the role of the pathologist and endosonographer in the evaluation of these lesions, as well as the corresponding FNA cytology and differential diagnosis.
