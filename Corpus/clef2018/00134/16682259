Screening for early pancreatic neoplasia in high-risk individuals: a prospective controlled study. Individuals with a strong family history of pancreatic cancer and persons with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) have an increased risk for pancreatic cancer. This study screened for early pancreatic neoplasia and compared the pancreatic abnormalities in high-risk individuals and control subjects.High-risk individuals with PJS or a strong family history of pancreatic cancer were prospectively evaluated with baseline and 12-month computed tomography (CT) scan and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS). If EUS was abnormal, EUS-fine-needle aspiration and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) were performed. Surgery was offered to patients with potentially neoplastic lesions. Radiologic findings and pathologic diagnoses were compared. Patients undergoing EUS and/or ERCP for benign non-pancreatic indications were concurrently enrolled as control subjects.Seventy-eight high-risk patients (72 from familial pancreatic cancer kindreds, 6 PJS) and 149 control patients were studied. To date, 8 patients with pancreatic neoplasia have been confirmed by surgery or fine-needle aspiration (10% yield of screening) 6 patients had 8 benign intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), 1 had an IPMN that progressed to invasive ductal adenocarcinoma, and 1 had pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia. EUS and CT also diagnosed 3 patients with 5 extrapancreatic neoplasms. At EUS and ERCP abnormalities suggestive of chronic pancreatitis were more common in high-risk patients than in control subjects.Screening EUS and CT diagnosed significant asymptomatic pancreatic and extrapancreatic neoplasms in high-risk individuals. IPMN should be considered a part of the phenotype of familial pancreatic cancer. Abnormalities suggestive of chronic pancreatitis are identified more commonly at EUS and ERCP in high-risk individuals.
