Pancreatic trauma: a case report. Pancreatic trauma is a rare event, accounting for approximately 3% of all blunt abdominal traumas. The related mortality is quite high, around 5-30%, mostly due to the associated haemorrhagic lesions and to the delay in establishing the diagnosis, while pancreatic damage is directly responsible for death in only 5-10% of cases. We report here on a case of severe pancreatic trauma, underestimated initially and treated surgically at a later stage. The literature shows that the main difficulty in cases of pancreatic trauma is still related to failure recognizing the injury or to the frequent delay in diagnosing the condition, above all in haemodynamically unstable patients. In these cases, as in the one treated in this report, the clinical evidence and the priority accorded to the treatment of the shock are factors that tend to limit thorough examination. In haemodynamically stable patients, on the other hand, the multislice CT-scan and MR pancreatography-wirsungography are useful for the diagnosis. The treatment can be either conservative or surgical, depending on the extent of the damage, especially to the Wirsung duct. Surgical treatment with preservation of the entire pancreatic parenchyma, as performed in our case, even if technically demanding, makes it possible to maintain the function of the pancreas, thus reducing the risk of metabolic complications.
