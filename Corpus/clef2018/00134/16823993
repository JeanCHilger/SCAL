Current treatment strategies for pancreatic cancer in the elderly. Pancreatic cancer, which is responsible for >90% of exocrine pancreatic tumours, is typically a disease of the elderly (> or =70 years of age). However, older patients are less likely to be staged than younger patients despite having a worse overall 5-year survival rate than their younger counterparts. Various radiological, ultrasonographic and endoscopic investigations are used not only as diagnostic tools but also to accurately stage the cancer for possible surgery. Many patients with pancreatic cancer have mutations of the K-ras oncogene, and various tumour suppressor genes are also inactivated. Pancreas resection can be performed in elderly resectable patients without excess mortality, even in those >80 years of age. However, treatment for locally advanced, unresectable and metastatic pancreatic cancer is palliative. Fluorouracil-based chemoradiation for locally advanced or unresectable cancer, and gemcitabine for patients with metastatic disease, can result in clinical benefits. Placement of a stent in the biliary tract has been shown to improve symptoms of obstructive jaundice or ascites, as well as quality of life. As molecular targets are identified, interventions with targeted specific agents may improve tumour control. However, further studies will be needed to demonstrate whether or not various agents targeting signal transduction pathways or nuclear transcription factors are useful for elderly patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.
