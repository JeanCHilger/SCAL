Imaging data suggesting acute pyelonephritis in the kidney graft: report of five cases with atypical clinical presentation. Acute pyelonephritis is a common complication of kidney transplantation, occurring in up to 1% of grafts. Diagnosis is mainly clinical and atypical presentations have seldom been reported. The diagnostic role of imaging techniques has not been defined. Five cases of acute graft pyelonephritis are reported (three kidney, two pancreas-kidney grafts). The patients (median age 48 years) comprised three females and two males. Median post-transplant follow-up was 3 months, with three patients having predisposing factors for diabetes and one for an enteric bladder. None of the patients presented the 'classic' diagnostic tetrad (i.e. fever, positive urine cultures, low urinary tract symptoms and serum creatinine increase) although, at diagnosis, two of five patients presented with fever, one had increased creatinine levels and one had positive urine cultures. Of note, three patients had leucocyte casts at urinary sediment analysis, thus raising clinical suspicion. Renal ultrasounds were negative in all patients. Renal (99m)Tc-MAG3 (mercaptoacetyltriglycine) scintigraphy, which was used for the definition of kidney function impairment (one patient) or because of the presence of urinary casts (three patients), or after the biopsy diagnosis to locate the parenchymal lesions (one patient), was positive in all patients. The presence and pyelonephritic origin of the parenchymal lesions was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance or computed tomography scans. Acute graft pyelonephritis may develop in the absence of a full-blown clinical picture. Smouldering symptoms may occur in the presence of large perfusion deficits. (99m)Tc-MAG3 scintigraphy could be an important diagnostic tool in such cases.
