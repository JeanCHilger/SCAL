Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography: comparison of respiratory-triggered three-dimensional fast-recovery fast spin-echo with parallel imaging technique and breath-hold half-Fourier two-dimensional single-shot fast spin-echo technique. The aim of this study was to compare magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) using respiratory-triggered (resp) three-dimensional Fourier transformation (3D) fast-recovery fast spin echo (FR-FSE) sequence with array spatial sensitivity technique (ASSET) for visualization of the pancreatobiliary system with breath-hold single thick-section and multiple thin-section MRCP using 2D single shot FSE (SSFSE) sequences.Forty patients underwent MRCP for evaluation of pancreatobiliary abnormalities in a 1.5-T magnet. Imaging time for resp 3D FR-FSE was recorded. The ghosting and blurring artifacts, overall image quality, and delineation of the pancreatobiliary ducts were evaluated using a five-point scale.On multisection 2D SSFSE source images, there were the least ghosting artifacts (4.9 +/- 0.3, P < 0.05). Ghosting (3.4 +/- 0.6, P < 0.05) and blurring (4.4 +/- 0.8 P < 0.05) artifacts were the most prominent on resp 3D FR-FSE. 3D FR-FSE MRCP provided the highest rating of overall image quality (4.3 +/- 0.8, P < 0.05) and delineation of third- and second-order branches of the hepatic ducts (2.9 +/- 1.6 for third-order branches and 3.9 +/- 1.3 for second-order branches, P < 0.05). Extrahepatic bile ducts, including upper and middle portions and cystic and pancreatic ducts, were also better seen with resp 3D FR-FSE MRCP than others.MRCP with resp 3D FR-FSE using ASSET can be routinely used for acquiring information from the pancreatobiliary system.
