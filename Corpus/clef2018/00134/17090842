Insulinoma: Diagnosis and surgical treatment. Retrospective analysis of 31 cases. Insulinomas are rare tumors that are usually benign, single and curable by simple surgical excision. They can present problems in diagnosis and localization.Retrospective analysis of patients with insulinoma managed during a 13-year period (1992-2005) at a tertiary-level institution.31 patients (mean age 38.4 [SD 13.3] years 16 men) presented with hypoglycemic symptoms for 4.6 (5.5) years. In 22 (71%) patients, the lesion was successfully localized pre-operatively. Of various pre-operative localization techniques, CT angiography (5/6Pre-operative investigations to localize insulinoma are helpful despite the availability of intra-operative ultrasound. Dual-phase CT should be the non-invasive investigation of first choice.
