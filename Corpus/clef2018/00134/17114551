Isotropic 3D T2-weighted MR cholangiopancreatography with parallel imaging: feasibility study. The aim of this study was to compare the quality of images obtained with fast 3D T2-weighted turbo spin-echo (TSE) MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) sequences and 1-mm isotropic voxels with the quality of conventional 2D MRCP images.Thirty consecutively registered patients (14 women, 16 men average age, 60.2 yearsQuantitative results showed free-breathing and breath-hold 3D TSE images had significantly higher relative signal intensity and contrast than 2D TSE images (p < 0.0001). The qualitative findings showed that both free-breathing and breath-hold 3D TSE techniques gave better delineation of biliary anatomy (p < 0.0001) than the 2D technique. The overall quality of 3D images was better than that of 2D images, and 3D imaging was better at depicting pancreatic ducts, although the difference did not reach statistical significance.Three-dimensional volumetric MRCP images are of superior quality and give better delineation of pancreaticobiliary anatomy than conventional 2D images and have the added advantage of multiplanar and postprocessing capabilities.
