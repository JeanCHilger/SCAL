A case of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor producing ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. We report a case of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma producing granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). A 56-year-old Japanese man was admitted to our hospital with back pain and high fever. An abdominal CT scan revealed masses in the pancreatic body to the tail, and both lobes of the liver. A biopsy specimen of the hepatic tumor demonstrated metastatic poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. We administered oral S-1 in combination with gemcitabine. However, his general condition gradually worsened, and a high serum level of G-CSF persisted. He died 135 days after admission. The diagnosis of autopsy was pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining showed the presence of G-CSF in tumor cells. The final diagnosis was G-CSF-producing pancreatic carcinoma.
