Selected management of pancreatic pseudocysts: operative versus expectant management. The aim of this study was to determine if nonoperative, noninterventional expectant management of pancreatic pseudocysts is warranted in selected patients.From 1980 to 1985, 114 patients with the diagnosis of pancreatic pseudocyst were evaluated.Forty-six patients underwent primary operative therapy, with 13% undergoing emergency operations for pseudocyst-related complications. Although no operative deaths occurred, significant morbidity occurred in 26% of patients (emergency operations, 67% elective procedures, 10%). The remaining 68 patients were initially treated selectively with a nonoperative, expectant approach. Severe, life-threatening complications in this group followed up for a mean of 46 months occurred in only 6 patients (9%)A nonoperative, noninterventional, expectant approach is warranted in the management of selected patients with pancreatic pseudocysts.
