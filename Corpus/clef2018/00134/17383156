Usefulness of F-18 FDG-PET in detection of multiple endocrine tumors with duodenal carcinoid. In a 76-year-old woman in whom hypercalcemia had been followed, whole body fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan detected hypermetabolic areas in the left lower region of the thyroid gland, pancreas tail, and duodenum. CT, MR, biopsy, and surgery were performed and parathyroid adenoma, pancreatic gastrinoma, and duodenal carcinoid were diagnosed. Fluorine-18 (F-18) FDG-PET may be useful for diagnosis of multiple endocrine tumors with duodenal carcinoid.
