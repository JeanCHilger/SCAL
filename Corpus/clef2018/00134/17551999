Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography: a useful tool in the evaluation of pancreatic and biliary disorders. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is being used with increasing frequency as a noninvasive alternative to diagnostic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The aim of this pictorial review is to demonstrate the usefulness of MRCP in the evaluation of pancreatic and biliary system disorders. Because the recently developed techniques allows improved spatial resolution and permits imaging of the entire pancreaticobiliary tract during a single breath hold, MRCP is of proven utility in a variety of pancreatic and biliary disorders. It uses MR imaging to visualize fluid in the biliary and pancreatic ducts as high signal intensity on T2 weighted sequences and is the newest modality for pancreatic and biliary duct imaging. Herein, we present the clinical applications of MRCP in a variety of pancreaticobiliary system disorders and conclude that it is an important diagnostic tool in terms of imaging of the pancreaticobiliary ductal system.
