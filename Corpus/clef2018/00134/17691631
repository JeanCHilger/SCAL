Dynamic computed tomography of the pancreas in normal dogs and in a dog with pancreatic insulinoma. To establish optimal imaging conditions for enhanced computed tomography (CT) for canine pancreatic tumors, 10 healthy beagles were subjected to dynamic CT. This technique was then applied to a dog with suspected insulinoma. The changes in mean peak enhancement and the delay time of the aorta and pancreas were determined. In normal beagles, maximal arterial and pancreatic CT enhancement was observed at 15 +/- 2 s (795 +/- 52 Housfield unit [HU]) and 28 +/- 9 s (118 +/- 16HU) after contrast medium injection, respectively. Multiphase enhanced CT was performed in a pug with suspected insulinoma using the CT protocol defined for the normal beagles with some parameters modified the images were acquired at the arterial (14 s after contrast medium injection), pancreatic (after 28 s), and equilibrium (after 90 s) phases
