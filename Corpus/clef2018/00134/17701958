Autoimmune pancreatitis. Approximately 2 per cent of pancreatic masses resected for suspected malignancy are found instead to be a form of chronic pancreatitis defined by a characteristic lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate. This condition is now commonly classified as 'autoimmune pancreatitis'.A literature review of autoimmune pancreatitis was performed using Medline and PubMed. The reference lists of identified articles were searched for further relevant publications.Patients are predominantly 55-65 years old and present with obstructive jaundice, abdominal pain and weight loss. Imaging may show a mass of malignant appearance or pancreatobiliary tree strictures precipitating surgical exploration. Raised serum levels of IgG4 and specific autoantibodies, when combined with particular radiological features and a biopsy negative for malignancy, enable a preoperative diagnosis and successful treatment with steroids.Autoimmune pancreatitis is not uncommon and steroid treatment can effect a dramatic improvement. Care is needed to ensure that pancreatic cancer is not misdiagnosed.
