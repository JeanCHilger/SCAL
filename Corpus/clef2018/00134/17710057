Laparoscopic treatment of paraesophageal hiatal hernia with incarceration of the pancreas and jejunum. We present a successful laparoscopic treatment of paraesophageal hiatal hernia with an incarceration of the pancreas and jejunum. The patient was a 75-year-old woman who had complaints of epigastric pain and dysphasia. A chest x-ray revealed a mediastinal air-fluid level. Chest computed tomography showed intestinal contents, body and tail of the pancreas, and the splenic artery within the mediastinum. At laparoscopy, jejunum was incarcerated into the mediastinal cavity through the internal hernia of transverse mesocolon. Body and tail of the pancreas and the splenic artery were also dislocated within the hernia sac. The operation time took 115 minutes. The patient tolerated a regular diet on the first postoperative day and was discharged uneventfully. There were no recurrence or abdominal symptoms during the 29-month follow-up period. In the case of asymptomatic paraesophageal hiatal hernia with incarcerating pancreas on diagnostic imagings, elective surgical treatment is required to prevent a critical outcome.
