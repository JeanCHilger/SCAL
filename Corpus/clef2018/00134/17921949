Role of EUS in a diagnostic and staging algorithm of pancreatic carcinoma: the surgeon point of view. Survival of pancreatic cancer is improved by surgery and is related to R0 resection. An accurate diagnosis and a careful staging are mandatory. Differential diagnosis must be estabilished between the different pancreatic lesions as carcinoma, chronic pancreatitis, cystic or endocrine neoplasms. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is the best technique for diagnosis and allows cytological examination by fine needle aspiration (FNA). Preoperative resectability is defined by EUS in borderline tumors. EUS is a useful procedure for the surgical strategy of pancreatic cancer.
