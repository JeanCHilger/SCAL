A long-term survivor case with good quality of life due to biliary bypass and gemcitabine for advanced pancreatic cancer. A 54-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of upper abdominal pain and anorexia. Physical examination revealed jaundice, and abdominal CT demonstrated a pancreatic mass and dilatation of bile duct. The patient was operated with the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. However, the pancreatic cancer was unresectable because of invasion of the surrounding organs and metastasis to paraaortic lymph nodes, so a biliary bypass was performed. After operation, chemotherapy using gemcitabine was performed in the outpatient clinic. He survived for more than two years and eleven months without recurrence of jaundice. Combination of biliary bypass and gemcitabine is considered helpful for good quality of life and long-term survival of a patient with advanced pancreatic cancer.
