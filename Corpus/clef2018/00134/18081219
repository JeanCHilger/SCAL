Utility of endoscopic ultrasound in pancreatitis: a review. The close proximity of the endoscopic ultrasound probe to the pancreas results in superior spatial resolution compared to CT scan and MRI. In addition, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is a minimally invasive procedure that does not share the relatively high complication rate of ERCP. Due to these advantages, EUS has evolved into an important technique to assess pancreatobiliary disease. This review will discuss the role of EUS in patients with pancreatitis. The indications can be divided into acute pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis. In acute pancreatitis, EUS is used to determine the etiology in suspected chronic pancreatitis it is helpful to establish the diagnosis. Lastly, this review will discuss biliary pancreatitis with suspicion for persistent choledocholithiasis.
