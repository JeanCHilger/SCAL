CT and MR imaging of pancreatic cancer. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are emerging noninvasive techniques for imaging of the pancreas. Based on multislice technology, CT enables multiplanar imaging of the pancreas (multislice-CT, MSCT) with a high contrast between vessels and parenchyma. In addition, MRI of the pancreas including the imaging of the lumina of the biliary tree and the pancreatic duct (magnetic resonance cholangiopancreaticography, MRCP) and the abdominal vessels (MR angiography, MRA) has become available for daily clinical practice in most hospitals. The addition of multiplanar and curved reformations may increase the sensitivity of CT and improves its agreement with surgical findings. Beyond abdominal MR imaging, techniques such as magnetic resonance cholangiopancreaticography (MRCP) and MR angiography should be integrated in the imaging protocol whenever possible.
