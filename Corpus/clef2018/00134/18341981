The role of echoendoscopic biopsy in diagnosing tuberculosis of pancreas. The diagnosis of an abdominal mass using imaging techniques is difficult for clinicians and radiologists. We report a case of an atypical peripancreatic mass, mimicking a carcinoma on abdominal computed tomography and which was only diagnosed after an echoendoscopic biopsy of the mass was performed. It is difficult to differentiate abdominal tuberculosis from a neoplasm, especially if there is no pulmonary tuberculosis. Usually, the diagnosis of abdominal tuberculosis is only confirmed histologically, after surgical resection of the mass. Echoendoscopic biopsy confirmed the infectious nature of the mass and prevented complicated and difficult surgery.
