Case report: cystic dystrophy of heterotopic pancreas (CDHP). Cystic dystrophy of heterotopic pancreas is characterized by the presence of cystic formations in the duodenal wall with or without associated pancreatitis. These lesions are found in young men (40-50 years old) with abusive alcohol intake. The patients are referred for suspected pancreatic neoplasm or for acute pancreatitis. IRM and endoscopic ultrasonography features allow preoperative diagnosis. First line treatment is medical with parenteral nutrition and octreotide. In complicated cases, surgery (pancreatoduodenectomy or bypass procedure) is indicated.
