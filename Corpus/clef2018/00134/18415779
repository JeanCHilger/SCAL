High-b-value diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of pancreatic cancer and mass-forming chronic pancreatitis: preliminary results. Mass-forming chronic pancreatitis may mimic a pancreatic cancer on dynamic computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and preoperative differential diagnosis is often difficult. Recently, the usefulness of diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer has been reported in several studies.To determine whether high-b-value DWI can distinguish pancreatic cancer from benign mass-forming chronic pancreatitis.Twenty pancreatic cancers and four cases of mass-forming chronic pancreatitis were evaluated by high-b-value DWI (b=800 s/mm(2)). The signal intensity on DWI was visually evaluated, and the isotropic apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) were measured.All twenty pancreatic cancers showed high signal intensity (18 showed very high, two showed slightly high) on DWI. None of the mass-forming chronic pancreatitis cases showed very high intensity (three showed iso to low, one showed slightly high) on DWI. The ADCs in the pancreatic cancer and mass-forming chronic pancreatitis were 1.38 +/- 0.32 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s and 1.00 +/- 0.18 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, respectively (P < 0.05).On high-b-value DWI, most pancreatic cancers showed very high signal intensity, and may hence be distinguished from benign mass-forming chronic pancreatitis based on our preliminary results.
