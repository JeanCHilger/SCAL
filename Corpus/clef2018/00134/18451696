A case of mucinous noncystic carcinoma of the pancreas. Mucinous (colloid) carcinoma is defined as pools of stromal extracellular mucin containing scanty, floating carcinoma cells. It is a well-defined entity in breast or large bowel. However, mucinous noncystic carcinoma of the pancreas (MNCC) is uncommon, comprising between 1% and 3% of all carcinomas of the pancreas. In the past, MNCC generally had been categorized together with ordinary ductal adenocarcinoma or misdiagnosed as mucinous cystadenocarcinoma or signet-ring cell carcinoma. The new WHO classification lists MNCC as a variant of ductal adenocarcinoma. Herein, we report a 32-year-old woman with incidentally found pancreatic body mass who underwent subtotal pancreatectomy. She was diagnosed as MNCC histologically.
