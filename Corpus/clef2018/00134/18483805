Update on 3D and multiplanar MDCT in the assessment of biliary and pancreatic pathology. The development of multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) has led to the acquisition of true isotropic voxels that can be postprocessed to yield images in any plane of the same resolution as the original axially acquired images. This, coupled with rapid MDCT imaging during peak target organ enhancement has led to a variety of means to review imaging information beyond that of the axial perspective. Postprocessing can be utilized to identify variant biliary anatomy to guide preoperative planning of biliary-related surgery, determine the level and cause of biliary obstruction and assist in staging of biliary cancer. Postprocessing can also be used to identify pancreatic ductal variants, visualize diagnostic features of pancreatic cystic lesions, diagnose and stage pancreatic cancer, and differentiate pancreatic from peripancreatic disease.
