Retroperitoneal giant mixed sarcoma. Case report. The Authors present a rare case of voluminous retroperitoneal tumor in a 41 years old woman. CT scan showed a solid abdominal expansive mass, with compression and displacement of the left lobe of the liver, spleen, stomach, pancreas, and left kidney. The patient underwent surgery for excision of a giant retroperitoneal mass. Surgery was uneventful. The patients recovered well. Histology showed a mixed liposarcoma and angiosarcoma with high grade of malignancy and positivity for vimentin, factor VIII, CD34, CD31 and negativity for S-100, CD68, AMS, AML. The prognosis of these tumours is closely related to local recurrence, histological type, size and radical surgery. A low-grade malignancy tumor, small sized and completely resected leads to a good prognosis. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy do not seem to have a strong influence on the prognosis. An aggressive surgical approach is the first choice for the treatment of such tumors. The resection of adjacent organs may be required for radical surgery.
