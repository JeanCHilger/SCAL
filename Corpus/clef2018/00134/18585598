Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography: techniques and applications. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) has become established as an essential modality in the evaluation of pancreatic and biliary abnormalities in children. New advances, such as faster imaging parameters, newer sequences, and contrast agents, are available to improve image quality. This article discusses conventional and advanced MRCP techniques used in children and applications of the techniques in evaluating common diseases of the pancreas and biliary tree.
