Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: a study of 48 cases. Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of the pancreas are relatively uncommon tumors. The objective of this report was to describe the cytopathologic and immunocytochemical features of NETs obtained by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA).Forty-eight patients who were diagnosed with pancreatic NETs based on EUS-guided FNA were studied retrospectively (from 2002 to 2007). Clinical data, EUS findings, cytopathologic features, and immunocytochemical stains were reviewed for this study. The final histopathologic diagnosis from each patient also was available for comparison.Forty-eight patients (28 men and 20 women) who ranged in age from 16 years to 86 years were selected and had the following clinical findings: solid or multiple pancreatic masses diagnosed by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging studies simultaneous, suspicious, metastatic masses in the liver, mediastinum, and/or lungThe current results indicated that EUS-guided FNA is a useful method for the diagnosis of pancreatic NETs. Cytopathologic examination in coordination with immunocytochemistry can provide an accurate diagnosis in most patients.
