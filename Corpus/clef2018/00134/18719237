3D 3He diffusion MRI as a local in vivo morphometric tool to evaluate emphysematous rat lungs. In this work, we investigate (3)He magnetic resonance imaging as a noninvasive morphometric tool to assess emphysematous disease state on a local level. Emphysema was induced intratracheally in rats with 25 U/100 g body wt of porcine pancreatic elastase dissolved in 200 microl saline. Rats were then paired with saline-dosed controls. Nine three-dimensional (3D) (3)He diffusion-weighted images were acquired at 1, 2, or 3 wk postdose, after which the lungs were harvested and prepared for histological analysis. Recently introduced indexes sensitive to the heterogeneity of the air space size distribution were calculated. These indexes, D(1) and D(2), were derived from the moments of the mean equivalent airway diameters. Averaged over the entire lung, it is shown that the average (3)He diffusivity (D(ave)) correlates well with histology (R = 0.85, P < 0.0001). By matching small (0.046 cm(2)) regions in (3)He images with corresponding regions in histological slices, D(ave) correlates significantly with both D(1) and D(2) (R = 0.88 and R = 0.90, respectively, with P < 0.0001). It is concluded that (3)He MRI is a viable noninvasive morphometric tool for localized in vivo emphysema assessment.
