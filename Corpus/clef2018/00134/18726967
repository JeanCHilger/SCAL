Reappraisal of endosonography of ampullary tumors: correlation with transabdominal sonography, CT, and MRI. To reappraise the accuracy of transabdominal sonography (US), CT, MRI, and endosonography (EUS) in the diagnosis and staging of ampullary tumors.We reviewed the medical records and the images of 41 consecutive patients with ampullary tumors. Tumor detection rate and accuracy of TNM (tumor-node-metastasis) staging of malignant tumors were determined. Imaging findings were correlated with histopathologic findings.The detection rates for ampullary tumors were 97.6% for EUS, 81.3% for MRI, 28.6% for CT, and 12.2% for US (p < 0.001 for EUS versus CT p < 0.001 for EUS versus USEUS was superior to CT and was equivalent to MRI for tumor detection and T and N staging of ampullary tumors. Neither indwelling stents nor tumor size, differentiation, or endoscopic appearance affected the staging accuracy of EUS.
