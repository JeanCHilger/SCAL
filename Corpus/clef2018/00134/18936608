F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in a solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas mimicking malignancy. Solid pseudopapillary tumors (SPTs), predominantly affecting young women, are rare pancreatic tumors. It is reported that imaging features of SPT are solid and cystic components, and there is intratumoral hemorrhage and calcification. However, findings of positron emission tomography (PET) using F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) with pathologic correlation have not been fully evaluated. We present a case of SPT that mimicked malignancy on FDG-PET.
