Giant insulinoma. Islet-cell tumors are the most common neuroendocrine tumors that arise from the endocrine pancreas. They are typically benign and sporadic. Diagnosis is generally established late because clinical signs lack specificity. The insulinoma is difficult to localize since it is very small in size, often not exceeding 2cm. We report an exceptional case of giant insulinoma initially revealed by a pseudo-polycythemia in an 80-year-old man. He had been treated for hypertension for a few months. Routine biological investigations showed elevated hematocrit and haemoglobin, suggesting Vaquez disease. History taking revealed recent episodes of nocturnal agitation. On admission, he had reddish skin with a suspected enlarged spleen, but total blood volume was normal. Imaging studies showed a voluminous tumor located between the pancreas and the spleen. The presence of an insulinoma was confirmed on the basis of an elevated level of proinsulin at the time of an asymptomatic episode of hypoglycemia. Spleno-pancreatectomy was performed. Histopathological examination revealed a malignant, well-differentiated neuroendocrine malignant tumor.
