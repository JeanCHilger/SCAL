Arteriovenous malformation of the pancreas: assessment of clinical and multislice CT features. This study was undertaken to analyze the clinical and CT features of arteriovenous malformation (AVM) of the pancreas.Seven lesions in six consecutive patients (one woman and five men, mean age 51 years) with AVM of the pancreas who underwent multiphase contrast-enhanced CT with 0.5 or 1-mm collimation were retrospectively studied. CT images were evaluated and correlated with angiographic findings by two radiologists.In four patients, the lesions were incidental findings. Two patients presented with abdominal pain and gastrointestinal bleeding, respectively. Serum amylase levels were within normal limits in all patients. The mean size of the lesions was 32.1 mm (3.0-97.3 mm). Conglomeration of strong nodular stains and early enhancement of the portal venous system were observed for all the lesions. The diagnosis of AVM of the pancreas was retrospectively established for all lesions, but was prospectively established for four lesions. The feeding arteries of all lesions were depicted, showing agreement with those observed by angiography performed for four lesions. One lesion showed pseudocyst formation, haziness around the lesion, and strong enhancement of the duodenal wall.Multiphase CT examination using multislice CT is useful for diagnosis of AVM of the pancreas, including identification of the feeding arteries.
