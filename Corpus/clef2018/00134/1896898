Surgical treatment of necrotizing hemorrhagic pancreatitis with a prolonged course. The authors describe the course of acute haemorrhagic necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by prolonged septicaemia, the formation of abscesses, acute haemorrhage and a intestinal fistula--"Critically ill patient". Early surgical elimination of necrotic septic foci is the prerequisite of effective treatment and cure. In the diagnosis CT and magnetic resonance prove most useful. With the latter so far little experience as been assembled. Ultrasonographic visualization technique is insufficient for the diagnosis of focal changes in the area of the pancreas.
