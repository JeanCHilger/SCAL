Minimally invasive resection of neuroendocrine pancreatic tumors. Pancreatic endocrine tumors (PET) are a heterogeneous group of lesions with an annual incidence of 0.1 to 0.4 per 100,000. They account for 2-4% of pancreatic neoplasms. Due to their mostly small size, some are suited to a laparoscopic approach. Preoperative localization, intraoperative laparoscopic ultrasonography, and considerable experience in pancreatic endocrine surgery and sophisticated laparoscopic techniques are essential for successful laparoscopic treatment of these tumors. If definite or highly suspicious signs of malignancy occur, a conventional open approach should be preferred. Insulinomas and small nonfunctioning PET in the pancreatic body or tail or near the surface of the pancreatic head and not in contact with the portal vein or the main pancreatic duct are suited to a laparoscopic approach. Patients with MEN1 who have insulinomas or small nonfunctioning PET may also benefit from a laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatic resection. Neither sporadic and MEN1-associated gastrinomas nor the very rare glucagonomas and vasoactive intestinal peptide-producing tumors (vipomas), which are often large and malignant, should also be tackled laparoscopically.
