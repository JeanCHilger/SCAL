Adrenal tumors and surgical approaches to the adrenal glands. In 1987 at the First Surgical Clinic in Bratislava four patients with adrenal tumours were operated. Hormonally inactive tumours are, however, diagnosed late on account of their latent growth. To the diagnosis of tumours sonography and computed tomography contributed in a major way. Adrenal tumours must be radically removed, sometimes even with surrounding organs (kidney, spleen, pancreas). Malignant tumours have a very adverse prognosis.
