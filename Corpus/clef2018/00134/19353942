Iron deficiency anaemia, pancreatitis and epigastric mass in a young female: a rare presentation of a large gastric trichobezoar. We report the case of a 15-year old girl presenting with a gastric fullness sensation. The biological examination showed iron deficiency anaemia and elevation of the pancreatic enzymes. At endoscopy, a huge trichobezoar is found in the stomach. The endoscopic removal is impossible due to the compacity of the mass. Surgical resection is therefore performed. The postoperative course is uneventful and the biologic anomalies are rapidly corrected. A throughout anamnesis revealed a trichotillomania with trichophagia, this behavioural trouble found its origin in a familial conflict.
