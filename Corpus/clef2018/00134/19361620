Solid pseudopapillary tumor in a pancreatic rest of the jejunum. Solid pseudopapillary tumors of the pancreas (SPTP) are very rare, and an SPTP arising in a pancreatic rest has been reported only 4 times previously and never in association with the jejunum. We report this unusual case of a 16 year old girl who presented with 4 days of intermittent, crampy abdominal pain and was found to have an SPTP arising in a pancreatic rest of the jejunum.
