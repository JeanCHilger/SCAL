Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas: correlation of helical CT features with pathologic findings. To evaluate the CT features of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas (IPMNs), and to compare with pathological findings in order to identify CT features that can be helpful in differentiating benign IPMNs from malignant IPMNs.The CT findings in 25 patients were reviewed for tumor location, tumor type, dilatation of the main pancreatic duct (MPD), MPD involvement, mural node or solid attenuating component, tumor size in branch duct or mixed duct type, dilatation of common bile duct (CBD) and invasion of surrounding structures. The data was subjected to Chi-Square Tests or Fisher's Exact Test using SPSS13.0 software with p value<0.05 indicating significant statistical difference.Presence of mural node or solid enhancing component, size of mural node or solid enhancing component ≥7mm, dilatation of CBD was more common in malignant IPMNs (p<0.05). None of tumor location, tumor type, dilatation of MPD, MPD involvement, tumor size, and invasion of surrounding structures was statistically significant in differentiating benign from malignant IPMNs.CT features suggestive of malignant or invasive IPMNs include presence of mural node or solid enhancing component, size of mural node or solid enhancing component ≥7mm, and dilatation of CBD.
