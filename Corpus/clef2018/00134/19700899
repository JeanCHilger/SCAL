An unusual cause of gastric outlet obstruction: a pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysm. We present a rare case of gastric outlet obstruction due to compression of the duodenum by a pancreaticoduodenal artery (PDA) aneurysm 2.5 cm in diameter, in a 43-year-old man from Saudi Arabia who presented with persistent vomiting and epigastric pain. The initial investigations and blood works were negative, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was unremarkable. A CT abdomen demonstrated a mass around the duodenum and dilatation of the stomach, and CT angiography showed the PDA aneurysm. The patient was stabilized and then referred to a tertiary center for embolization. Our case demonstrates a diagnostic challenge that physicians may encounter in patients who present with vomiting and epigastric pain.
