CT findings of an ectopic pancreas in the anterior mediastinum. We report here on a rare case of an ectopic pancreatic tissue in the anterior mediastinum. A 32-year-old woman without any symptoms was transferred to our hospital because of an abnormal large mediastinal shadow on her chest radiograph during a checkup. The computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a giant cystic-solid mass that measured 16 x 13 x 8 cm and it was located in the center of the anterior mediastinum and it symmetrically grew to two sides. On enhanced CT scans, the solid component of the mass showed marked enhancement. We performed total surgical resection of the mass and complete pancreatic tissues were verified on the pathological examination.
