Imaging procedures in abdominal tumors. The value of imaging modalities in abdominal malignancies is discussed. Ultrasound is the first method to perform in hepatic tumors--HCC and liver metastases--, followed by CT and/or MRI. CT and ERCP are the diagnostic procedures of choice in pancreatic cancer. MRI is inferior to bolus-enhanced CT. CT and MRI are still equal in colorectal cancers for differentiating between scar and local recurrence after abdominal-perineal amputation.
