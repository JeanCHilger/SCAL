A case of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm arising from Santorini's duct in a patient with complete type of pancreas divisum. There have been an increasing number of reports of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas since its first report by Ohhasi et al. in 1982. Most IPMNs arise from Wirsungs duct or its branches, whereas IPMNs arising from Santorinis duct are rare. Pancreas divisum is a common congenital anatomical anomaly characterized by the lack of fusion of the ventral and dorsal parts of the pancreas during the eighth week of fetal development. Although clinical significance of pancreas divisum has been the subject of debate for many years, there seems to be little doubt that in certain patients there is a causal relation between pancreas divisum and pancreatitis. Also, it is occasionally accompanied by a pancreatic tumor. Herein, we report a case of IPMN arising from Santorinis duct in patient with complete type of pancreas divisum.
