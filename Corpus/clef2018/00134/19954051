The diagnostic value of intraductal ultrasonography for complex biliary and pancreatic diseases. To assess the diagnostic value of intraductal ultrasonography (IDUS)when the findings of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) were not clearly demonstrated.One hundred and thirty-one cases of suspected biliary and pancreatic diseases were enrolled. IDUS was performed after unsatisfactory ERCP. Then the outcomes were correlated with the pathological results.Sixty-six benign and 58 malignant cases were clarified with additional IDUS after ERCP according to definite diagnostic criteria. The diagnostic accuracy was 94.3% and 95.1% the sensitivity and specificity were 95.4% and 100%, 80.0% and 76.9%, respectively. Moreover, it could distinguish benign tissues from malignant ones successfullyIDUS after ERCP yields higher diagnostic accuracy for complex biliary and pancreatic diseases and it is also more dependable in differentiating benign tissues from malignant ones than ERCP alone.
