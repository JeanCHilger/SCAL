Localized peripancreatic plasma cell Castleman disease. Castleman disease (CD) is a rare, benign, and usually systemic lymphoproliferative disorder. Unicentric Castleman disease of the pancreas is extremely rare, with only less than 10 cases described in the literature. We describe a case of an isolated peripancreatic localization of a plasma cell-type Castleman disease, its clinical presentation, the diagnostic evaluation, and the cure of disease by surgical excision.
