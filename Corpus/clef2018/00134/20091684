Hypopharyngeal perforation during endoscopic ultrasound treated by primary repair. An endoscopic ultrasound scan is a common procedure used to diagnose conditions of the upper gastrointestinal tract. We present a case of hypopharyngeal perforation complicating endoscopic ultrasound scan treated with primary surgical repair.A 62-year-old woman underwent an endoscopic ultrasound scan for investigation of a pancreatic lesion. A high esophageal perforation occurred during the procedure. She underwent emergency repair of this perforation via an external approach. Unfortunately her recovery was complicated by a pleural effusion which required a chest drain. She made a complete recovery, which was confirmed with a barium swallow.Upper esophageal perforation is a rare complication of an endoscopic ultrasound scan and, to our knowledge, there have been no reported cases of hypopharyngeal perforation. The risk factors, incidence, and management of perforations are reviewed. Early recognition of hypopharyngeal perforation is important and, in selected cases, immediate repair of the defect can lead to a good result.
