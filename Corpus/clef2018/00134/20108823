Clinical case of the month. A 29-year-old man with acute onset blurry vision, weakness, and gait abnormality. Stroke. A 29-year-old man, with no significant past medical history, was in his usual state of health until the afternoon of admission. The patient was seated at work eating lunch when he suddenly noticed that his vision became blurry. He covered his right eye and had no visual difficulty but noted blurry vision upon covering his left eye. At this point, the patient tried to stand up, but had difficulty walking and noticed he was "falling toward his left." Facial asymmetry when smiling was also appreciated. The patient denied any alteration in mental status, confusion, antecedent or current headaches, aura, chest pains, or shortness of breath. He was not taking any prescribed medications and had no known allergies. The patient denied any prior hospitalization or surgery. He denied use of tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs, and worked as a maintenance worker in a hotel. His family history is remarkable for his father who died of pancreatic cancer in his 50s and his mother who died of an unknown heart condition in her late 40s. Vital signs on presentation to the emergency department included temperature of 97.6 degrees F respiratory rate of 18 per minute
