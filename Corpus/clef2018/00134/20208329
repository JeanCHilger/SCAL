Lymphoepithelial pancreatic cyst: an atypical benign pancreatic mass presenting with a "cheerios-like" appearance. Lymphoepithelial cyst of the pancreas is a rare benign lesion which often presents as an incidental radiological finding, but may cause symptoms, such as abdominal pain and nausea. It can occur at any location in the pancreas. The differential diagnosis includes primary splenic cysts, pseudocysts, mucinous cystic neoplasms of the pancreas, left adrenal cysts, duplication cysts and retroperitoneal cysts. Some of these diagnoses can be excluded by MRI however, for the final diagnosis, fine needle aspiration or surgical resection may be necessary.We report a rare case of a pancreatic lymphoepithelial cyst in an asymptomatic 63-year-old man, discovered in a clinical follow-up for colon cancer. In particular, we describe the unique "cheerios-like" appearance of the lesion which has never before been reported.This particular finding could help in the differential diagnosis of this benign lesion from other pancreatic masses.
