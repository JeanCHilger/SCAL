CT: early diagnosis and prognosis prediction of severe pancreatitis. Eighty-three onsets of severe pancreatitis were divided into grades A, B, and C according to CT findings, and, at the same time, into stages I, II, and III on the basis of 11 clinical criteria. The two classification systems were compared with each other with respect to patients clinical course, intraoperative observation, and the pathology of the pancreas. It was found that CT scanning is more valuable than clinical criteria in early diagnosis and outcome prediction in addition to advantages such as clear image, accurate location and direct surgical approach.
