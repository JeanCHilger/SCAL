Jejunocolic fistulae after pylorus-preserving pancreatic head resection: an uncommon cause of chronic diarrhea. In patients with a history of pancreatic surgery, chronic diarrhea is mainly caused by exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. The authors report, for the first time, a case of jejunocolic fistulae as a cause of diarrhea and weight loss after pancreatic head resection.A 55-year-old patient presented with chronic diarrhea and cachexia. He had undergone pylorus-preserving pancreatic head resection for chronic pancreatitis 8 years earlier. A recent colonoscopy showed an uncommon anatomy of the colon. Gastroscopy and computed tomography revealed several jejunocolic fistulae as the cause of chronic diarrhea. The patient underwent surgery and the fistula-carrying parts of jejunum and colon were resected. After surgery, his clinical status improved and he gained weight.Interenteric fistulae after pylorus-preserving pancreatic head resection have not been reported so far. Impaired synchronization of gastric emptying and bile secretion could be a possible cause of autodigestion in the anastomosis region.
