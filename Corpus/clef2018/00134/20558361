Verner-Morrison syndrome: a case study. Verner and Morrison described a syndrome of watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria (WDHA) in 1958. VIPomas producing high amounts of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) commonly originate from the pancreas. Typical symptoms play a momentous role in the diagnosis of VIPoma. Diarrhea may persist for years before the diagnosis. Morbidity from untreated WDHA syndrome is associated with long-standing dehydration and with electrolyte and acid-base metabolism disorders, which may cause chronic renal failure. Assessment of specific marker (VIP) offers high sensitivity in establishing the diagnosis. Imaging modalities include endoscopic ultrasonography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, and particularly, scintigraphy with somatostatin analogues. Treatment options include resection of the tumor, chemotherapy or the reduction of symptoms with somatostatin analogues. Early diagnosis and management may affect survival of patients favorably. VIPoma cases may be associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1.
