Large cystic acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas. Acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas is a rare neoplasm exhibiting pancreatic enzyme production by the neoplastic cells. It has a highly characteristic cellular arrangement reflecting its acinar derivation, and a definite diagnosis is made based on immunohistochemical and ultrastructural results. Such tumors are often large but rather well circumscribed. Some cases have a cystic appearance due to hemorrhage or necrosis, but a large cystic mass appearing as a pseudocyst is quite rare. We present a large cystic acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas.
