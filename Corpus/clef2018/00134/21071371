Complications of congenital and developmental abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract in adolescents and adults: evaluation with multimodality imaging. There is a wide variety of congenital anomalies that may affect the gastrointestinal tract. Most symptomatic congenital anomalies are found in newborns and infants. Such anomalies are relatively rare in adolescents and adults, and they may be difficult to identify because clinical symptoms often are nonspecific and insidious, causing them to be mistaken for other common abdominal conditions. Multimodality imaging is useful in evaluating congenital anomalies of the gastrointestinal tract in adults. The imaging features at radiography, fluoroscopy, ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging may help identify congenital gastrointestinal anomalies such as congenital esophageal stenosis, gastric volvulus, duodenal web, annular pancreas, heterotopic pancreas, cecal volvulus, anomalies of the omphalomesenteric duct, Hirschsprung disease, and gastrointestinal duplication cyst. Familiarity with the imaging features of the various congenital anomalies of the gastrointestinal tract and their complications is important to establish the correct diagnosis and determine appropriate treatment, which is critical to avoid life-threatening complications.
