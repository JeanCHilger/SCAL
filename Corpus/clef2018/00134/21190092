Resectable pancreatic metastasis of left thighbone leiomyosarcoma: case report and literature review. Metastases to the pancreas gland are uncommon, especially from leiomyosarcoma. We report a case of asymptomatic pancreatic metastasis resection of leiomyosarcoma.A 59-year-old patient was treated for thighbone leiomyosarcoma, with surgical resection and adjuvant radiotherapy. After 4 years of follow-up, although that patient was asymptomatic, a pancreatic metastasis was identified by CT and fine needle aspiration. Open left pancreatectomy was performed.We discuss diagnosis findings and interest in the surgical resection. Furthermore, we reviewed previously reported cases.
