Intramedullary fat necrosis, polyarthritis and panniculitis with pancreatic tumor: a case report. Acute polyarthritis can occur in non-rheumatic systemic illnesses, presenting a diagnostic dilemma. We present an extremely rare case presenting as acute polyarthritis, panniculitis and medullary fat necrosis with underlying pancreatic pathology. This case report describes a young woman presenting with panniculits, pancreatic tumour, polyarthritis and intra-osseus fat necrosis with a fatal outcome. The medical fraternity needs to be aware of this potentially fatal albeit rare musculoskeletal complication secondary to a pancreatic pathology.
