A surgical (pancreatoduodenectomy) case of lymph node metastatic recurrence of colon cancer after chemotherapy. A woman in her fifties underwent a right hemicolectomy (D3) for cancer of the ascending colon in October 2007, definitively and pathologically diagnosed as papillary adenocarcinoma invading to the subserosa, and no metastasis was detected to lymph node. But 13 months after the surgery, she was found to have a mass near the anastomosis by an abdominal CT scan. Colonoscopy showed an evaluating lesion with ulcer in the anal side of the anastomosis. We tried to resect the metastasis, but it was not resectable because of the invasion to the pancreas. The mFOLFOX regimen was effective. After the chemotherapy (6 courses), we decided to perform a radical resection. We conducted pancreatoduodenectomy in May 2009. She is still alive 12 months after surgery.
