Positron emission tomography in congenital hyperinsulinism. We report a case of congenital hyperinsulinism with diffuse pancreatic abnormality diagnosed preoperatively by using [18-F]-L-DOPA positron emission tomography (PET). The infant was referred to us for recurrent hypoglycemia. Critical blood sample revealed increased insulin: glucose ratio. DOPA PET scan revealed diffuse involvement of pancreas. Subtotal (95%) pancreatectomy was done. Infant remained euglycemic on breast feeds at discharge.
