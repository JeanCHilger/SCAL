Clinical characteristics of 327 Asian patients with autoimmune pancreatitis based on Asian diagnostic criteria. To clarify the clinical and pathophysiological characteristics of autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) in Asia.A retrospective, actual situation survey of AIP diagnosed by Asian criteria was conducted in 10 centers of Japan, Korea, Taiwan, China, and India.A total of 327 AIP cases (258 male and 69 female subjects average age, 60.0 years) were enrolled. Obstructive jaundice was the most frequent initial symptom (46%-74%), followed by weight loss (4%-51%) and abdominal pain (19%-44%). Diffuse swelling of the pancreas was frequent in Japan (64%) and Korea (81%), but segmental swelling of the pancreas was more frequent in Taiwan (70%) and China (72%) (P < 0.01). Serum immunoglobulin G4 levels were elevated in 58%-100% of cases in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. Pathologically, almost all AIPs in Asia were lymphoplasmacytic sclerosing pancreatitis. Sclerosing cholangitis was the most frequent extrapancreatic lesion (60%-81%). Steroid therapy was a major and effective therapeutic strategy in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. However, the rate of resection or bypass operation was higher in Taiwan (40%) and China (72%) (P < 0.01).Features of AIP are fundamentally similar in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and China. Knowledge of emerging AIP should be more widespread in Asia to avoid unnecessary operation.
