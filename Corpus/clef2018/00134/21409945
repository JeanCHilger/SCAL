Infarcted accessory spleen due to segmental portal hypertension. Accessory spleens are frequent entities, but their infarction due to arterial stasis caused by segmental portal hypertension is extremely rare. We present this case of a 38-year-old female patient with a three-week history of abdominal pain and an abdominal CT scan revealing a 7 cm mass near the spleen and tail of pancreas with segmental portal hypertension. The patient had no hematologic disease. This mass was surgically resected, with a pathological diagnosis of an infarcted accessory spleen.
