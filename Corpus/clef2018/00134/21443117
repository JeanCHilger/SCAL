Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging to predict pancreatic fistula after distal pancreatectomy. This study hopes to identify risk factors for postoperative pancreatic fistulae in patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy.The study group was composed of 39 patients who had undergone distal pancreatectomy between January 2000 and June 2008. Fourteen presumed risk factors were retrospectively reviewed.Pancreatic fistula developed in 10 patients (25.6%). Pancreatic fibrosis estimated by dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was the only predictor of pancreatic fistula formation after distal pancreatectomy (p = 0.037).The preoperative evaluation of pancreatic fibrosis by dynamic MRI can provide reliable and objective information for predicting the risk of postoperative pancreatic fistula after distal pancreatectomy.
