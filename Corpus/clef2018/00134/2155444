Periportal-peripancreatic tuberculous adenitis. US and CT findings. We present ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) findings in 7 patients with periportal and peripancreatic tuberculous adenitis. In US scans, hypoechoic adenopathies were found in 6 patients while in the other one a hypoechoic, poorly marginated mass was seen. CT studies showed hypodense (25-35 HU) enlarged lymph nodes with immediate postcontrast peripheral rim enhancement in 3 patients. An infiltrating inhomogeneous mass was present in other patient and soft tissue density lobulated masses were found in delayed postcontrast scans of 2 patients. The US findings are of no help in distinguishing tuberculosis from other causes of adenitis. The CT appearance has been variable and only the hypodense nodes with peripheral enhancement in postcontrast scans are suggestive of this entity.
