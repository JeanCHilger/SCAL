Endosonographic findings of gastric ectopic pancreas: a single center experience. Ectopic pancreas is a common submucosal lesion in the stomach, but its histological diagnosis is usually difficult when tissue samples are obtained with a conventional biopsy forceps. The aim of this study was to describe the endosonographic features of gastric ectopic pancreas.We retrospectively analyzed a database of all patients who underwent endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) at Pusan National University Hospital from July 2006 to August 2010. A total of 26 patients with histologically confirmed ectopic pancreas were included in the study. The EUS features of their lesions were analyzed.Ten lesions were located in the antrum, and 16 lesions were located in the body. Nine lesions (34.6%) showed an umbilication or central dimpling on the surface, and a mural growth pattern was most commonly observed (61.5%). Twenty-four lesions (92.3%) showed hypoechoic echogenicity, and 13 lesions (50.0%) were heterogeneous. The borders were indistinct in 16 lesions (61.5%) and lobulated margins were observed in 16 lesions (61.5%). Anechoic cystic or tubular structures appeared in 17 lesions (65.4%), and 20 lesions (76.9%) involved two or more sonographic layers.The characteristic EUS features of ectopic pancreas are indistinct borders, lobulated margins, presence of anechoic duct-like structures, a mural growth pattern, and localization within two or more layers. These EUS features are potentially useful for differentiating ectopic pancreas from other mesenchymal tumors in the stomach.
