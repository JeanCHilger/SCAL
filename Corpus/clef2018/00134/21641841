Solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm of pancreas with long delayed liver metastasis. Solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN) of the pancreas is a rare neoplasm that most commonly affects adolescent girls and young women. Solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas is considered to have malignant potential 10% to 15% of cases are associated with metastasis, and these usually present at the time of initial diagnoses. Cases with metastases after resection are rare, and all reported cases have occurred less than 5 years after resection. We report a case of SPN in a 36-year-old woman who presented with liver metastasis 15.8 years after complete resection of the primary tumor in the pancreas. To the best of our knowledge, this is the longest time interval reported between resection of primary tumor and subsequent detection of metastatic disease. Solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas can present with metastases many years after resection of the primary tumor. Long-term follow-up is warranted, given the possibility of late metastasis.
