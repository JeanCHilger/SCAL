Elastography: the next step. In the past few decades, various tools have emerged that claim to enhance detection of oral cancer. The most important prognostic factor in patients with oral cancer is lymph node status: the presence of nodal spread decreases the 5-year survival rate by approximately 50%. Differentiation between reactive and metastatic lymphadenopathy is thus vital, and one differentiating criterion is hardness (elasticity) of the lymph node. The purpose of this review is to highlight a promising new ultrasound technique, known as elastography, which measures the characteristics of tissue compliance. The principles underlying elastography are that tissue compression produces strain (displacement) within the tissue - which is lower in harder tissues than in softer tissues - and that malignant tissues are generally harder than normal surrounding tissue. Therefore, elastography might yield clinical information useful in diagnosing cervical metastasis and improving prognosis in oral cancer. It has long been used for cancers of the breast, pancreas, and thyroid, and its use in cervical lymphadenopathy is now being explored, which could lead to great advancements in the diagnosis and prognosis of oral cancer.
