A double cancer of the gallbladder and common bile duct associated with an anomalous arrangement of the choledocho-pancreatic ductal junction--a case report and a review of the literature. Reported is the case of a 65-year-old woman who complained of general fatigue and itching. The cancer of the gallbladder and the common bile duct associated with anomalous arrangement of choledocho-pancreatic ductal junction was diagnosed after examination by ERCP, PTCS, US, and CT. The cancer of the common bile duct had metastasized to the pancreas, the portal vein, and the regional lymph nodes and was unresectable. It is well known that an anomalous arrangement of the choledocho-pancreatic ductal junction is highly associated with a cancer of the common bile duct or the gallbladder. But a case that is associated with double cancers is rare and only 6 cases have been reported in the Japanese literature. In addition to a discussion of this case, the literature is reviewed.
