Long-term outcome of high-intensity focused ultrasound in advanced pancreatic cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate safety and efficacy of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for advanced pancreatic cancer (PC).Patients with PC TNM stage III or IV were included. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed 2 weeks before and after the HIFU. The ablating tumor volume was calculated by ratio of the nonperfused necrotic area of the planned area on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted image on post-HIFU magnetic resonance imaging. The ablation results were stratified into 4 ranges: 100% to 90% unenhanced area of targeting area, 90% to 50%, within 50%, and no change.High-intensity focused ultrasound treatment was performed without severe adverse event in 46 patients, 49 times (male-female = 25:21 mean age, 60.7 Â± 10.0High-intensity focused ultrasound is safe and effective, which induced excellent local tumor control in most patients with advanced PC.
