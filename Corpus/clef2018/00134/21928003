Usefulness of gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance cholangiography for detecting mucin retention in bile ducts: a rare intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the bile duct. We report a 75-year-old man with radiological evidence of a 4.5 Ã— 3.0 cm cystic mass and polypoid masses in the left hepatic lobe. Study of surgical specimens returned a definitive diagnosis of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the bile duct (IPMN-B). IPMN-B, thought to be the counterpart of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas (IPMN), is frequently associated with marked mucin production. We describe a rare case of IPMN-B in which gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance cholangiography was useful for detecting mucin retention in the bile ducts.
