Non-operative treatment of severe blunt pancreatic trauma in children. Diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic trauma in children is challenging. Grade I and II lesions of the pancreas (Organ Injury Scale of the American Association of Trauma) are generally treated non-operatively. However, the optimal treatment of pancreatic lesions with involvement of the pancreatic duct (grade III-V) has still to be determined. In this report, we describe a child with a grade III traumatic lesion of the pancreas, who was successfully treated conservatively. Furthermore, we discuss diagnostic and treatment strategies of paediatric pancreatic injuries.
