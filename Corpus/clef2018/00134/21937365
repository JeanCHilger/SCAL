Pancreatoduodenectomy after coronary artery bypass grafting using the right gastroepiploic artery: a case report. We herein report the case of an advanced ampullary cancer developed 80 months after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) using the right gastroepiploic artery (RGEA) and successfully treated by pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) with revascularization using the great saphenous vein. A 69-year-old Japanese male was admitted for examination with one-month history of nausea and appetite loss. He underwent three vessel CABG, involving bypassing between the right coronary artery and RGEA about 80 months before. The preoperative diagnosis with CT scan and gastric endoscope was carcinoma of the papilla of Vater. Preoperative abdominal angiography showed the RGEA graft remained well patent. He underwent PD with regional lymph node dissection after revascularization of the RGEA. The postoperative clinical course was uneventful. The histopathological examinations of the resected specimen revealed adenocarcinoma of the ampulla, pT2, pN0, M0 stage IB. The patient is currently alive without any further signs of ischemic heart disease several months after his operation. This case report demonstrates that the radical PD with revascularization using other vein graft can be safely performed after CABG using the RGEA.
