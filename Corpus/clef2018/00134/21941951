Role of endoscopic ultrasound guided FNAC in diagnosis of pancreatic TB presenting as mass lesion: a case report and review of literature. A 24-year-old male patient presented with abdominal pain, obstructive jaundice, anorexia and weight loss. Ultrasound abdomen revealed pancreatic head mass with dilated common hepatic duct and intrahepatic bliliary radicles. CECT abdomen was suggestive of pancreatic head mass invading portal vein, splenic artery and hepatic artery. Provisional diagnosis of unresectable carcinoma head of pancreas was established. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) was done, which was also suggestive of pancreatic head mass infiltrating portal vein. EUS guided Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) was taken with an intent to obtain tissue diagnosis and to start palliative chemotherapy. EUS guided FNAC features were suggestive of tuberculosis (TB). Patient was started on anti-tubercular therapy, to which he responded and was cured. Pancreatic tuberculosis should be considered as a possibility, in pancreatic mass, especially in countries where TB is endemic and establishing its diagnosis with the aid of FNAC can save trauma of major surgery to the patient, which prompted us to report this case.
