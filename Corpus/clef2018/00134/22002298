A rare cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding:  hemosuccus pancreaticus:  angiographic and endoscopic combined treatment. Hemosuccus pancreaticus (HP) is a rare cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Pancreatitis are the most common cause of HP. Here, we report the case of a 48-year-old male with HP due to alcohol-induced chronic pancreatitis. Superior mesenteric angiography showed an inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery pseudoaneurysm. The patient underwent coil embolization for treatment of his pseudoaneurysm. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and pancreatic stents replacement was performed for pancreatic pseudocyst drainage. In patients with HP, angiographic and endoscopic combined treatment can protect from the risks of surgery.
