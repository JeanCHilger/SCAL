Serous cystadenoma and mucinous cystadenoma/cystadenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Clinical manifestation, diagnostic procedure and therapeutic concept. Cystic neoplasms are rare but in the last ten years more frequently detected tumors of the pancreas. The clinical symptoms as abdominal pain, abdominal mass, diarrhoea or weight loss are rather unspecific. There are no typical laboratory findings. Localization, size and cystic character of these tumors are well documented by ultrasound or abdominal computed tomography while typical features in CT as well as US-guided fine needle biopsy may contribute to further differentiation of the tumors. Exocrine and endocrine pancreatic function are frequently weakened which might falsly lead to the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis. Because of their malignant potential mucinous cystadenoma should be treated by complete surgical resection while serous cystadenoma are exclusively benign and might therefore be treated conservatively in uncomplicated cases or high-risk patients. The prognosis of pancreatic cystadenocarcinoma is obviously better compared to adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.
