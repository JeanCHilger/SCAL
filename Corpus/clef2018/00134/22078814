Magnetic resonance imaging versus endoscopic ultrasonography for the detection of pancreatic tumours in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. In multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, the main risk factor for metastases is pancreatic tumour size. We and others recommend limiting surgery to non-functioning pancreatic tumors ≥20 mm or growing, based on their size measured with endoscopic ultrasonography. Because endoscopic ultrasonography is invasive, we compared endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) to non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the detection of pancreatic tumours ≥10 mm in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 patients.A prospective study was performed in nine participating centres 90 patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 underwent EUS and MRI with gadolinium infusion. Gastroenterologists and radiologists were blinded to the results, magnetic resonance images were reviewed centrally.EUS detected 86 tumours ≥10 mm, and 48 (53.3%) patients had at least one tumour ≥10 mm. MRI detected 67 tumours ≥10 mm, and 46 (51.1%) patients had at least one tumour ≥10 mm. EUS and MRI agreement was moderate for detection of tumours ≥10 mm (Kappa coefficient=0.49), and for selection of patients with tumours ≥10 mm (Kappa coefficient=0.55). EUS and MRI missed 11/24 and 4/24 lesions ≥20 mm, respectively. EUS failed to identify 9/57 (15.7%) patients with pancreatic tumours ≥10 mm, and MRI failed to identify 11/57 (19.3%) patients with pancreatic tumours ≥10 mm.EUS and MRI are complementary and should be performed at initial evaluation in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 patients. Whether follow-up should be based on either technique or both, requires further evaluation.
