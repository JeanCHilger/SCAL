Neuroendocrine carcinoma in an adolescent with hypercortisolemia. We present a 16-year-old boy with weakness, hypercortisolemia, and markedly elevated adrenocorticotropic hormone. Computed tomographic imaging revealed hepatic lesions and a calcified pancreatic mass. Biopsy of the hepatic lesions revealed moderately differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma. The primary tumor could not be determined. The patient received neoadjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin and etoposide followed by therapeutic bilateral adrenalectomy and tumor debulking. Despite significant clinical improvement, restaging revealed progressive hepatic disease. The patient died 9 months after diagnosis. Autopsy revealed disseminated neuroendocrine carcinoma. The rarity of this tumor compels a cooperative investigational model involving pediatric and adult oncologists.
