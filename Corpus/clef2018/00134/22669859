Primary disseminated extrahepatic abdominal hydatid cyst: a rare disease. Hydatid disease (HD) is a parasitic disease, most frequently caused by Echinococcus granulosus or Echinococcus multilocularis and rarely by Echinococcus vogeli or Echinococcus oligarthus. Mostly, hydatid cyst is primarily in liver (75%) and lung (15%). Peritoneal HD (13%) is usually secondary. Dissemination of HD may occur following rupture of the hydatid cyst into the peritoneal cavity. Primary peritoneal hydatid cyst disease is a rare phenomenon. We present a case of primary disseminated abdominal HD presenting with the complaint of a pain in the epigastric region along with intermittent fever. Radiological evaluation and serological examination confirmed it as primary disseminated HD involving pancreas, a cyst anterior to the left lobe of the liver just below the peritoneum and the left kidney.
