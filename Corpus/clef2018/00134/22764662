Heterotopic pancreas revealed by post-traumatic pancreatitis. We report the case of an 82-year-old female presenting with acute epigastric abdominal pain after traumatic blow on the epigastrum. High-resolution multimodal imaging comprising Ultrasound, CT and MR, correlation with laboratory blood analyses and a 6 months CT follow-up allowed us to make a definite diagnosis of traumatic heterotopic pancreatitis. This case emphasizes the relevance of a well-targeted high-definition ultrasound study in the following of the first imaging modality.
