Somatostatinoma of the first jejunal loop in a patient with neurofibromatosis von Recklinghausen and bilateral pheochromocytoma. Somatostatinoma is a rare neuroendocrine tumor which especially develops in the pancreas. There are few communicated cases about extra-pancreatic localization, having as a particularity the absence of somatostatin hypersecretion syndrome and frequent association with von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis. We present the case of a 42-year old patient with Von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis admitted in our clinic with a chronic upper digestive obstruction syndrome. The presence of a first jejunal loop somatostatinoma was an intraoperative surprising diagnosis that imposed jejunal resection and association of complementary specific treatment. Despite the therapeutic correct management, the status of the patient deteriorated very fast, confirming the aggressiveness of this neoplasia.
