A comparison of electronic radial and curvilinear endoscopic ultrasonography in the detection of pancreatic malignant tumor. There is no comparative study of electronic radial endoscopic ultrasonography (ER-EUS) and electronic curvilinear EUS (EC-EUS). The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy of ER-EUS and EC-EUS for detecting pancreatic malignancies.This was a retrospective review of the patients who had EUS assessment from September 2008 to December 2011 for suspicious pancreatic tumors. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve to detect pancreatic malignancies were calculated and compared between the ER-EUS and EC-EUS cohort. The final diagnosis of pancreatic malignancy was based on pathology, or the consensus of patient's clinical course and multimodal imaging tests.Two hundred twenty-one patients were included and divided into two cohorts: ER-EUS (n = 139) and EC-EUS (n = 82) cohorts. With propensity score matching method, 70 cases in each cohort were selected for the comparison. There was no significant difference in sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve to detect pancreatic malignancy between ER-EUS and EC-EUS cohort (88.5 vs. 100%, 88.6 vs. 90.9%, 0.8855 vs. 0.9545).ER-EUS and EC-EUS provided similar accuracy for the detection of pancreatic malignancies. In view of similar diagnostic results of ER-EUS and EC-EUS for the detection of pancreatic malignancy, and the advantage of being able to perform FNA with EC-EUS, EC-EUS may be the preferred choice.
