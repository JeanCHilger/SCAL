Inflammatory mass formation caused by gastric ectopic pancreas: report of a case. Ectopic pancreas is a relatively rare condition that only occasionally causes the development of symptoms. This report presents a case of ectopic pancreas presenting as an inflammatory mass that formed in the gastric wall, which was successfully treated by surgical resection. A 32-year-old female was admitted due to a 3-year history of recurrent episodes of upper abdominal pain. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed an irregularly enhanced mass of heterogeneous density in the gastric antrum. Gastroscopy revealed a submucosally elevated mass with a central umbilication in the gastric antrum. These studies indicated the presence of a 3-cm ectopic pancreas associated with inflammatory changes. The patient underwent laparoscopic local resection of the stomach. Microscopic examination of the lesion revealed heterogenic pancreatic tissue containing islets, dilated pancreatic ducts, and massive fibrosis in the gastric wall, with acinar atrophy and inflammatory cell infiltration. These findings indicated the formation of an inflammatory mass in the ectopic pancreas.
