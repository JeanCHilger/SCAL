Perinatal neuroblastoma of the pancreas. Neuroblastoma is the most common solid tumor in infancy. Arising from the neural crest these tumors are usually located along the sympathetic chain from the neck to the pelvis and in the adrenal medulla. We report the case of a 3-week-old boy presenting with recurrent episodes of colicky pain. After ultrasound examination, magnetic resonance imaging and laboratory data a pancreatic neuroblastoma was suspected. Tumor resection via distal pancreatectomy and histologic investigation confirmed the diagnosis. Surgery is the treatment of choice in children with pancreatic masses, and is usually well tolerated even in the neonatal period. Conclusive diagnosis can be frequently established only by tumor resection or biopsy. Pancreatic neuroblastoma is an extremely rare tumor with only a few cases described in literature.
