Variation in precursor lesions of pancreatic cancer among high-risk groups. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) surveillance programs are currently offered to high-risk individuals aiming to detect precursor lesions or PDAC at an early stage. We assessed differences in frequency and behavior of precursor lesions and PDAC between two high-risk groups.Individuals with a p16-Leiden germline mutation (N = 116 median age 54 years) and individuals from familial pancreatic cancer (FPC) families (N = 125Cystic lesions were more common in the FPC cohort (42% vs. 16% in p16-Leiden cohort), whereas PDAC was more common in the p16-Leiden cohort (7% vs. 0.8% in FPC cohort). Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) was a common finding in surgical specimens of FPC-individuals, and was only found in two patients of the p16-Leiden cohort. In the p16-Leiden cohort, a substantial proportion of cystic lesions showed growth or malignant transformation during follow-up, whereas in FPC individuals most cystic lesions remain stable.In p16-Leiden mutation carriers, cystic lesions have a higher malignant potential than in FPC-individuals. On the basis of these findings, a more intensive surveillance program may be considered in this high-risk group.
