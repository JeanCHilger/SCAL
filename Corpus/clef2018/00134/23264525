Anomalies, anatomic variants, and sources of diagnostic pitfalls in pancreatic imaging. In this review, a brief discussion of the important events of pancreatic embryology is followed by presentation of congenital anomalies and normal variants. For each variant, the appearance at different radiologic modalities including computed tomography, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, MR cholangiopancreatography, and fluoroscopy will be demonstrated.
