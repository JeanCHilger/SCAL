Endoscopic ultrasound and pancreatic applications: what the radiologist needs to know. As the technology has improved, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has taken on an important role in the diagnosis of a number of different neoplastic and non-neoplastic pancreatic diseases. EUS can provide high-resolution images with subtle anatomic detail, and has also taken on an important role in the targeted biopsy of the pancreas and adjacent structures. This review seeks to familiarize radiologists with the role of EUS in the diagnosis of chronic and autoimmune pancreatitis, solid pancreatic masses, and cystic pancreatic neoplasms.
