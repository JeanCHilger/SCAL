Evaluation of the BISAP score in predicting severity and prognoses of acute pancreatitis in Chinese patients. The present study was to evaluate the accuracy of bedside index for severity in acute pancreatitis (BISAP) in predicting the severity and prognoses of acute pancreatitis (AP) in Chinese patients. Clinical data for 497 patients with AP were analyzed retrospectively to compare BISAP with acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II, Ranson, and computed tomography severity index scores in predicting the severity of AP and the occurrence of pancreatic necrosis, mortality, and organ failure in patients with severe AP (SAP) using the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve. Of the 497 patients, 396 had mild AP and 101 had SAP. There were significant correlations between the scores of any two systems. BISAP performed similarly to other scoring systems in predicting SAP, as well as pancreatic necrosis, mortality, and organ failure in SAP patients, in terms of the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve. BISAP score is valuable in predicting the severity of AP and prognoses of SAP in Chinese patients.
