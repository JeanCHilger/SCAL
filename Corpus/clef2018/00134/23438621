Transcatheter embolization of a giant pancreatic pseudoaneurysm: a tale of two bleeds and one thrombus! Erosion of a peripancreatic artery into the pseudocyst as a result of enzymatic digestion of vessel wall gives rise to a pancreatic pseudoaneurysm (PSA), which is a rare complication seen in patients with chronic pancreatitis.(1) Angiographic embolization as a treatment method for acute hemorrhage from pancreatic PSA has become increasingly popular. Here we report a unique case with bleeding from a giant pancreatic PSA where the single PSA had blood supply originating from the branches of both the celiac artery and superior mesenteric artery.
