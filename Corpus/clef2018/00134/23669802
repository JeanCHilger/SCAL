Palmar fasciitis and polyarthritis syndrome in pancreatic carcinoma. Palmar fasciitis and polyarthritis syndrome is a rare paraneoplastic condition that may portend a diagnosis of malignancy. We describe the case of a 73-year-old man who presented with progressive palmar swelling, erythema, pain, and contractures of both hands, This presentation and associated weight loss eventually led to the diagnosis of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This case highlights the often delayed, but important diagnosis of this unusual paraneoplastic phenomenon which can mimic arthropathy, Dupuytren contracture, and scleroderma. Our case is also the first documentation of the extensive inflammatory magnetic resonance imaging changes in palmar fasciitis and polyarthritis syndrome, which affects all tissue planes including the synovium and explains its confusing clinical manifestations.
