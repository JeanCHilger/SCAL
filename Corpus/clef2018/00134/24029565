Preoperative evaluation of vascular involvement and general resectability of pancreatic carcinoma by using 64-slice spiral computed tomographical angiography. To assess for preoperative evaluation of 64-slice spiral computed tomographical angiography (64-SCTA) to predict vascular involvement and general resectability of pancreatic malignant tumors.The material of 64-SCTA in 34 cases were retrospectively analyzed. Preoperative imaging findings were correlated with intraoperative and histopathologic results.For the arterial tumor invasion based on 64-SCTA findings, 1 grade was in 8 cases 2 grade, 6 cases64-SCTA can provide reliable information for vascular involvement and general resectability of pancreatic malignant tumors. 64-SCTA has high value in clinical application.
