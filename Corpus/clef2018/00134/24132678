Contrast-enhanced sonography and endoscopic ultrasound for the diagnosis of pancreatic diseases. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has increased the diagnostic spectrum of clinical ultrasound. Especially the introduction of specific contrast-enhanced software in connection with the development of second generation contrast enhancers has enabled the development of CEUS to a stage where it sometimes furnishes better diagnostic results than any other cross-sectional diagnostic imaging method. The present article should provide the reader with an overview about the diagnostic possibilities of CEUS including contrast-enhanced endoscopic ultrasound. The reader should then be able to understand the weaknesses and strengths of CEUS in the diagnostic apporach to pancreatic diseases.
