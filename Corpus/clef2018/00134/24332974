Clinical application of 3D VIBECAIPI-DIXON for non-enhanced imaging of the pancreas compared to a standard 2D fat-saturated FLASH. To compare a fast 3D VIBE sequence with Dixon fat saturation and CAIPIRINHA acceleration techniques (3D VIBE(CAIPI-DIXON)) to a standard 2D FLASH sequence with spectral fat saturation and conventional GRAPPA acceleration technique (2D Flash(GRAPPA-fs)) for non-enhanced imaging of the pancreas.In this retrospective, institutional review board-approved intra-individual comparison study, 29 patients (7 female, 22 male mean age 60.4 ± 20.9 years) examined on a 48-channel 3.0-T MR system (MAGNETOM Skyra VD 13, Siemens Healthcare Sector, Germany) were included. 3D VIBE(CAIPI-DIXON) (TR/TE-3.95/2.5+1.27 ms3D VIBE(CAIPI-DIXON) was preferred in 72.4% (both readers) and 2D Flash(GRAPPA-fs) in 3.4%/6.9% (reader 1/2) of cases with a kappa value of 0.756. The main reasons for this preference were homogenous fat saturation with 3D VIBE(CAIPI-DIXON) and reduced motion artifacts due to a faster acquisition, leading to improved delineation of the pancreas. Signal ratios of pancreatic to fat signal for 3D VIBE(CAIPI-DIXON) (10.08 ± 3.48) and 2D Flash(GRAPPA-fs) (6.53 ± 3.07) were statistically different (P<.001). However, no additional statistically significant differences in signal ratios were identified (range: 0.73 ± 0.18 to 1.37 ± 0.40 .514<P<.961). SNR did not statistically significantly differ between the sequences.3D VIBE(CAIPI-DIXON) enables robust pancreatic imaging with a shorter time and improved fat suppression relative to conventional 2D Flash(GRAPPA-fs). At an acquisition time of 12 seconds, 3D VIBE(CAIPI-DIXON) can be obtained in considerably less time than standard fat-saturated VIBE sequences.
