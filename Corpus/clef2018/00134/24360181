Use of rebiopsy for clinically diagnosed metastatic lesion in patients with breast cancer. To evaluate the roles of rebiopsy for clinically diagnosed metastatic lesion in detecting the changes of hormonal receptors and second malignancy.The metastatic lesions were rebiopsied by core needle aspiration or incision in 42 patients with a clinical diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer by computed tomography or ultrasound.None of major complications occurred. Thirty-one metastases were proved pathologically. The discrepancies between primary breast cancer and metastatic lesions of estrogen receptor(ER), progesterone receptor(PR), HER-2 statuses were 22.6%, 25.8% and 9.7% respectively. And 7 second malignancies were found (16.7%, 5 primary lung and 2 primary pancreas cancers). Four patients showed no relapse through rebiopsy.The rebiopsy of clinically diagnosed metastatic breast cancer may find the discrepancies of ER, PR, HER-2 statuses and second malignancy so as to change the therapeutic strategies of patients.
