Impact of pancreatic comorbidities in patients with end-stage liver disease on outcome after liver transplantation. Diseases leading to end-stage liver disease (ESLD), especially alcoholic liver cirrhosis cause comorbidities of the pancreas, too. The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the impact of pancreatic alterations diagnosed pretransplant on the outcome after liver transplantation (LT).In total, data from 372 LT patients were analyzed. Patients were followed up for a mean of 4.2 years. Incidence of chronic pancreatitis (CP), pancreatic cysts (PC) and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) was acquired retrospectively from patient's charts.CP, IPMN and PC were rarely diagnosed in LT-recipients [CP (3.8%), PC (1.6%) and IPMN (1.6%)]. There was no significant correlation of IPMN, CP, PC and other patient characteristics. The prevalence of CP (log rank: p=0.315), PC (log rank: p=0.242) and IPMN (log rank: p=0.491) did not influence patient survival.Frequency of radiological alterations of the pancreas in LT recipients (such as CP, PC, IPMN) diagnosed by sonography, CT scan or MRI is comparable to the non-transplant population. Short term survival of LT-recipients after transplantation is not reduced for patients with CP, PC and patients with branch-duct IPMN (with a low-risk for malignancy according to international consensus guidelines).
