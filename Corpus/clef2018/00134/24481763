Lung cancer screening: the radiologist's perspective. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide and accounts for more deaths than breast, prostate, colon, and pancreatic cancers combined. A distinct minority (15%) of lung cancers are diagnosed at an early stage 5-year survival (all lung cancers) approximates 15%. Randomized, controlled trials in the 1960s and 1970s found that chest radiographic screening did not confer a survival benefit for high-risk patients. Recently, however, the randomized, controlled National Lung Screening Trail (NLST) provided category 1 evidence that low-dose computed tomography (CT) screening conferred a significant survival benefit for screened individuals: lung cancer-specific mortality was reduced by 20% after 6.5 years of follow-up
