Efficacy of CT-guided splanchnic nerve block for persistent pain after fluoroscopy-guided nerve block in a patient with advanced pancreatic cancer. We report a successful case of CT-guided splanchnic nerve block in a patient with advanced pancreatic cancer. A 76-year-old woman with epigastric distress was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer with multiple metastases. She underwent chemotherapy, but decided on best supportive care when her performance status worsened. Computed tomography revealed a 6 x 8 cm tumor mass in the pancreatic head. Oral oxycodone 20 mg x day(1) was ineffective and her Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) score was 9. Fluoroscopy-guided splanchnic nerve block with alcohol from L1-2 significantly reduced her pain, but she still required a fentanyl patch 2.1 mg x 3 days(-1) and loxoprofen (NRS 3). Four days later, we performed CT-guided splanchnic nerve block with alcohol 10 ml from T11-12. This significantly alleviated her pain and she was discharged uneventfully. She died 3 weeks after discharge. CT-guided splanchnic nerve block may be useful in cases of insufficient pain relief after fluoroscopy-guided splanchnic nerve block.
