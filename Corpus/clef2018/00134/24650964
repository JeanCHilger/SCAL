Analysis of risk factors for pancreatic duct stones formation in patients with alcoholic chronic pancreatitis. Alcoholic chronic pancreatitis (ACP) is the dominant cause of chronic pancreatitis (CP). As a main complication of CP, the formation of pancreatic duct stones (PDS) compromises pancreatic function and symptomatic patients are often subjected to aggressive treatments. The present study aimed to identify PDS risk factors in patients with ACP.A retrospective analysis of 93 ACP patients was performed patients were divided into two groups: ACP with PDS (n = 48) and ACP without PDS (n = 45). Fourteen potential factors were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analyses to identify independent risk factors of PDS formation in ACP patients. A comparison of demographic and clinical characteristics between ACP patients with PDS and non-ACP patients with PDS (n = 43) was also carried out.ACP accounted for 47.7% (93/195) of CP in this cohort. Among ACP patients, the morbidity of PDS was 51.6% (48/93). Significant risk factors of PDS formation for ACP patients included duration of drinking ≥24.7 years (OR, 9.036 95% CI, 2.737-29.837Alcohol consumption accelerates the progression of PDS formation in patients with CP.
