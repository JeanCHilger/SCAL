Optimization of MR diffusion-weighted imaging acquisitions for pancreatic cancer at 3.0T. To investigate and optimize diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) acquisitions for pancreatic cancer at 3.0T.Forty-five patients with pancreatic cancer were examined by four DWI acquisitions with b values=0 and 600s/mm(2) at 3.0T, including breath-holding DWI (BH-DWI), respiratory-triggered DWI (TRIG-DWI), respiratory-triggered DWI with inversion-recovery technique (TRIGIR-DWI), and free-breathing DWI with inversion-recovery technique (FBIR-DWI). Artifacts, contrast ratio (CR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of pancreatic cancer were statistically compared among DWI acquisitions.TRIGIR-DWI displayed the lowest artifacts and highest CR compared to other DWI acquisitions. CNRs of pancreatic cancer in TRIG-DWI and TRIGIR-DWI were statistically higher than that in FBIR-DWI and BH-DWI. Different ADCs between pancreatic cancer and noncancerous pancreatic tissues were noticed by a paired-samples T test in TRIG-DWI (p=0.017), TRIGIR-DWI (p=0.00001) and FBIR-DWI (p=0.000041).TRIGIR-DWI may be the optimal acquisition of DWI for pancreatic cancer at 3.0T.
