Respiratory self-gating for free-breathing magnetization transfer MRI of the abdomen. Magnetization transfer (MT) MRI can be effective for the diagnosis of a broad range of fibrotic diseases, including liver fibrosis. However, respiratory motion, a major source of artifacts in thoracic and abdominal MR imaging, can obscure important anatomic structures, making diagnosis difficult. In this study, we explored the potential to combine free-breathing (FB) respiratory self-gating (RSG) methods with MT saturation for FB MT ratio (MTR) measurements of abdominal organs.A respiratory self-gated multiple-gradient recalled echo sequence with MT presaturation (RSG-MT GRE) was developed and applied in a series of seven normal volunteers. We compared the MTR values of liver, pancreas, kidney, spleen, and posterior paraspinal muscle measured using our RSG-MT GRE sequence and a conventional MT GRE sequence.RSG consistently reduced motion artifacts within MT-weighted images acquired during FB, improved the accuracy of FB MTR measurements, and produced comparable MTRs to breath-holding MTR measurements.RSG approaches may offer to improve the utility of MT-weighted imaging methods for the assessment of fibrotic diseases and tumor desmoplasia in abdominal organs.
