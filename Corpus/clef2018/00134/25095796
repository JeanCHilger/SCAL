Enhanced immunoPET of ALCAM-positive colorectal carcinoma using site-specific ⁶⁴Cu-DOTA conjugation. Activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) is an immunoglobulin superfamily cell adhesion molecule that is aberrantly expressed in a wide variety of human tumors, including melanoma, prostate cancer, breast cancer, colorectal carcinoma, bladder cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This wide spectrum of human malignancies makes ALCAM a prospective pan-cancer immunoPET target to aid in detection and diagnosis in multiple malignancies. In this study, we assess site-specific versus non-site-specific conjugation strategies for (64)Cu-DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid) immunoPET imaging of a fully human ALCAM cys-diabody (cDb) with a reduced linker length that retains its bivalent binding ability. ALCAM constructs with linker lengths of eight, five and three amino acids were produced to make true non-covalent site-specifically modified cDbs. Characterization by gel electrophoresis, size exclusion chromatography, flow cytometry and mass spectrometry of the various constructs was performed. To demonstrate the increased utility of targeting multiple malignancies expressing ALCAM, we compare the targeting of the site-specific versus non-site-specific conjugated cDbs to the human colorectal cancer xenograft LS174T. Interestingly, the conjugation strategy not only affects tumor targeting but also hepatic and renal uptake/clearance.
