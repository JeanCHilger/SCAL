Conventional open surgery of a splenic artery aneurysm following failure of endovascular management. The clinical case of a 73 years old man is reported, complaining for a long time of a persistent abdominal pain in the left upper quadrants, without irradiation and no identified causative factor. These symptoms affected notoriously his quality of life, becoming disabling for his social and professional activities. The investigation by means of CT-scans disclosed a spheric mass, partially calcified, having 44x41mms of maximum size, located between the pancreatic tail and the splenic hilum. A subsequent angio-CT confirmed the diagnosis of a large splenic artery aneurysm and the patient underwent the attempt of an endovascular exclusion by means of an endoprosthesis, which could not be successfully accomplished due to the multiple kinkings and coilings of the splenic artery. Several coils were then used to occlude the aneurismal sac. Contrarily to the expectations, the pain did not disappear after the procedure, becoming even worse, and an open surgical approach was then advised, in another hospital institution, which he promptly accepted. The operation consisted in the resection of the aneurysm and an associated splenectomy, due to multiple infarcts identified in the spleen, consequence of the previous endovascular management. The post operative course was uneventful and he was discharged on day 3. One and four months later he was found in excellent condition and totally pain-free, having resumed his social and professional activities. Based on this clinical case, the authors intend to put an emphasis on this constraint of the endovascular management of peripheral arterial aneurysms, namely on those causing external compression syndromes, painful or others, which can not be relieved by the endovascular exclusion of the aneurysm, as it happened with this patient, thus justifying its presentation and dissemination.
