Adjuvant therapy with WT1 peptide-pulsed dendritic cell therapy in combination with TS-1 for pancreatic cancer with positive peritoneal cytology after curative operation. A 66-year-old woman was diagnosed with pancreatic tail cancer, and she was referred to our hospital. Abdominal computed tomography(CT)revealed a tumor(2.5 cm in diameter)in the pancreatic tail, with invasion to the spleen and splenic vein. In February 2013, we performed distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy, left adrenal gland resection, and D2 lymph node dissection. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage cytology during surgery was positive however, we performed curative resection because there were no signs of peritoneal dissemination and distant metastasis. The patient was discharged from the hospital 23 days after the operation, with good postoperative course. Histological diagnosis was pancreatic tail cancer, pT4N0H0P0M(-) fStage IVa. Subsequently, the patient received postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy(TS-1: 100mg/day, 4 courses)combined with Wilms'tumor 1(WT1)peptide-pulsed dendritic cell therapy. No serious adverse events occurred during the postoperative adjuvant therapy. The patient remains alive without recurrence 16 months after the operation.
