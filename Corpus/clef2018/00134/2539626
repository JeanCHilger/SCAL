The value of non-contrast computed tomography in acute pancreatitis. The value of non contrast computed tomography for the early diagnosis and staging of acute pancreatitis has been investigated in 90 patients. The volume of the pancreas and of extra-pancreatic inflammatory infiltrates was statistically significantly larger in necrotising pancreatitis than in interstitial pancreatitis. The extent of intrapancreatic hypodensity (below 40 HU) showed no significant correlation with the pathologically determined extent of pancreatic necrosis. Densitometry of the extrapancreatic infiltrate indicates its nature with considerable accuracy (oedematous-inflammatory or haemorrhagic-necrotising).
