Predominantly intraductal low-grade differentiated adenocarcinoma in young man with long time mask clinic of chronic pancreatitis. The authors present the case of diagnosis of low-grade adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, a man 34 years old, a long time to mask clinic chronic pancreatitis. Laboratory and instrumental investigations, including tumor markers CD 19-9, CEA, ultrasound, CT, MRI showed no reliable data for the presence of tumor. On the other hand, a young man of 34 years present credible evidence of chronic pancreatitis, in the form of a typical pain, a significant increase in serum am- ylase and lipase, and the presence of parenchymal and ductal signs of pancreatitis in visual research methods. Diagnosis of tumors, including obtaining morphological material, pre-operative pain relief were obtain by endoscopic methods. Histological examination of surgical specimens was detected a rare type of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the pancreas tubulo-papillary structures, with predominant intraductal growth and a minimum depth of invasion due to pronounced fibrotic outcome variables, which leads to a complex disease diagnostics. After 1.5 years, after adequately performed surgery the patient was revealed metastases to the liver.
