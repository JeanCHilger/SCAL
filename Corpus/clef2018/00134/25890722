A near-infrared phthalocyanine dye-labeled agent for integrin αvβ6-targeted theranostics of pancreatic cancer. Integrin αvβ6 is widely upregulated in variant malignant cancers but is undetectable in normal organs, making it a promising target for cancer diagnostic imaging and therapy. Using streptavidin-biotin chemistry, we synthesized an integrin αvβ6-targeted near-infrared phthalocyanine dye-labeled agent, termed Dye-SA-B-HK, and investigated whether it could be used for cancer imaging, optical imaging-guided surgery, and phototherapy in pancreatic cancer mouse models. Dye-SA-B-HK specifically bound to integrin αvβ6 in vitro and in vivo with high receptor binding affinity. Using small-animal optical imaging, we detected subcutaneous and orthotopic BxPC-3 human pancreatic cancer xenografts in vivo. Upon optical image-guidance, the orthotopically growing pancreatic cancer lesions could be successfully removed by surgery. Using light irradiation, Dye-SA-B-HK manifested remarkable antitumor effects both in vitro and in vivo. (18)F-FDG positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and ex vivo fluorescence staining validated the observed decrease in proliferation of treated tumors by Dye-DA-B-HK phototherapy. Tissue microarray results revealed overexpression of integrin αvβ6 in over 95% cases of human pancreatic cancer, indicating that theranostic application of Dye-DA-B-HK has clear translational potential. Overall, the results of this study demonstrated that integrin αvβ6-specific Dye-SA-B-HK is a promising theranostic agent for the management of pancreatic cancer.
