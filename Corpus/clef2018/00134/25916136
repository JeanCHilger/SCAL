Endoscopic ultrasonography in determining resectability of the pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The publication presents the results of the examination and treatment of 82 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The main objective of the work is the evaluation of endosonography diagnostic significance in identifying tumor vascular invasion and determining resectability of the tumor. The paper describes an EUS methodology, type of echoendoscopes and ultrasound criteria for tumor invasion to the blood vessels. Vessel invasion during endosonography was suspected in 48 (58.5%) cases, according to surgery data, tumor invasion into upper abdomen vessels was detected in 51 patients (62.2%). Sensitivity of endosonography in detecting vessel invasion was 90.2%, specificity--93.5%, accuracy--91.5%. Endosonography being in trend of present day ideas about the criteria of pancreatic cancer resectability is the leading method in the selection of patients to surgery.
