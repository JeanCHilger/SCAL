A cost analysis of a pancreatic cancer screening protocol in high-risk populations. Pancreatic cancer is the 4th leading cause of cancer death in the United States. A screening protocol is needed to catch early-stage, resectable disease. This study suggests a protocol for high-risk individuals and assesses the cost in the context of the Affordable Care Act.Medicare and national average pricing were used for cost analysis of a protocol using magnetic resonance imaging/MRCP biannually in high-risk groups.Costs per year of life added" based on Medicare and national average costs, respectively, are as follows: $638.62 and $2,542.37 for Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, $945.33 and $3,763.44 for hereditary pancreatitis, $1,141.77 and $4,545.45 for familial pancreatic cancer and "p16-Leiden" mutations, and $356.42 and $1,418.92 for new-onset diabetes over age 50 with weight loss or smoking.A screening program using magnetic resonance imaging/MRCP is affordable in high-risk populations. The United States Preventive Services Task Force must re-evaluate its pancreatic cancer screening guidelines to make screening more cost-effective for the individual.
