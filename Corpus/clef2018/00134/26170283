Functional expression of sodium-glucose transporters in cancer. Glucose is a major metabolic substrate required for cancer cell survival and growth. It is mainly imported into cells by facilitated glucose transporters (GLUTs). Here we demonstrate the importance of another glucose import system, the sodium-dependent glucose transporters (SGLTs), in pancreatic and prostate adenocarcinomas, and investigate their role in cancer cell survival. Three experimental approaches were used: (i) immunohistochemical mapping of SGLT1 and SGLT2 distribution in tumors (ii) measurement of glucose uptake in fresh isolated tumors using an SGLT-specific radioactive glucose analog, Î±-methyl-4-deoxy-4-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucopyranoside (Me4FDG), which is not transported by GLUTs
