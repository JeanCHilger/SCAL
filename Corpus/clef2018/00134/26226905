Surgery for Pancreatic Cancer. Surgical resection remains the only potentially curative therapy for pancreatic cancer, despite a high rate of systemic recurrence. Because of local invasion or distant spread, a minority of patients presenting with pancreatic cancer are candidates for surgery. Although perioperative mortality is low in high-volume settings, pancreatic surgery remains associated with considerable morbidity. Minimally invasive and robotic surgical techniques are increasingly used for pancreatic resection, although not always applicable to all patients. Strategies to extend the benefits of margin-negative surgical resection to more patients include surgery with vascular resection and reconstruction for locally invasive tumors, and resection after neoadjuvant therapy.
