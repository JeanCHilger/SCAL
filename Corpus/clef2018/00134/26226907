Diagnosis and Management of Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma. Borderline resectable pancreatic cancer represents a subcategory of advanced cancer that is typically defined by limited involvement of the major mesenteric vasculature. Such involvement is associated with a high likelihood of microscopically incomplete resection if surgery is used as the primary therapeutic modality. Increasing data support the role of neoadjuvant therapy as part of multimodality management but there is no uniformly accepted standard of care. This review discusses, based on recent literature and the experience of the Pancreatic Tumor Study Group at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, the classification, definition, diagnosis, and management of borderline resectable pancreatic cancer.
