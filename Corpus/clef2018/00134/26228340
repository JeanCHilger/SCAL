Ampullary carcinoid tumour presenting with extrahepatic biliary obstruction. Carcinoid tumours are slow growing tumours, derived from enterochromaffin cells located in the crypts of Lieberk√ºhn, which is part of neuroendocrine system. A 36-year-old female patient presented in surgical clinic with complaints of progressively increasing yellowish discolouration of her eyes and pruritis for 6 months. She was deeply jaundiced with a soft and non-tender abdomen.
