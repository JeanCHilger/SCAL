Transcatheter Arterial Embolization Alone for Giant Hepatic Hemangioma. Giant hepatic hemangioma is a benign liver condition that may be treated using surgery. We studied the digital subtraction angiographic (DSA) characteristics of giant hepatic hemangioma, and the effectiveness of transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) alone for its treatment. This was a retrospective study of 27 patients diagnosed with giant hepatic hemangioma and treated with TAE alone (using lipiodol mixed with pingyangmycin) at the Division of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University, between January 2010 and March 2013. The feeding arteries were identified using DSA. All patients were followed up for between three weeks and 12 months. Changes in tumor diameter and symptoms were observed. The 27 patients included had giant hepatic hemangiomas ranging from 5.3 to 24.5 cm (mean, 11.24±5.08 cm) in the right (n = 13), left (n = 1) or both (n = 13) lobes. Preoperative hepatic angiography showed multiple abnormal vascular lakes in the early phase, known as the "early leaving but late returning, hanging nut on a twig" sign. On the day after TAE, hepatic transaminase levels were increased (ALT: 22.69±17.95 to 94.88±210.32 U/L ALT: 24.00±12.37 to 99.70±211.54 U/L
