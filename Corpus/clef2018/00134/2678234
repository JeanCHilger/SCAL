Diagnostic strategy in pancreatic tumors. In 62 patients with proven pancreatic tumours in a joint retrospective study the sequence of diagnostic imaging methods was analysed. Their diagnostic value was evaluated according to their contribution to final diagnosis and a diagnostic strategy was derived. A valuable primary investigation is sonography. It should be complemented, according to the specific question, by ERCP, PTC and CT. The investigation with barium meal is a complementing method for the differentiation of epigastric disorders. Biopsy of the tumour for histologic purposes should be done as early as possible. A first guiding diagnosis was obtained with ultrasound in 50% of the cases, in 53% of them already with the first examination. In 23% of the patients, however, the final diagnosis was established not before surgery or dissection.
