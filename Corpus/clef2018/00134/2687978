Echography in the diagnosis of pathology of the gallbladder and bile ducts. Personal experience. We evaluated the echographic findings in gallbladder and bile duct disease in 300 patients. These findings were correlated with those obtained after surgery and post-mortem study. The literature was reviewed to compare our results with those of other authors. In some pathologies, mainly those involving distension of the choledochus, echography must be accompanied by other diagnostic techniques, endoscopy and conventional radiology, to determine the cause of the obstruction responsible for distension. Finally, we conclude that echography is very efficient in this kind of exploration because of its high diagnostic reliability, its innocuousness and the fact that barium contrast is not required.
