Disseminated fat necrosis: a rehabilitation challenge. Disseminated fat necrosis (DFN) is a rare complication of pancreatic disease characterized by subcutaneous nodules, visceral effusions, osseous intramedullary fat necrosis, and arthritis. The rehabilitation of a 33-year-old patient with DFN is described here. The patient had a history of alcoholic pancreatitis for which she underwent a subtotal pancreatectomy. Three months later she developed subcutaneous nodules and migratory polyarthralgias. The diagnosis of DFN as the etiology of her arthritis was confirmed by synovial fluid analysis in addition, magnetic resonance imaging of her long bones revealed multiple marrow infarcts. She was nonambulatory and required assistance with transfers because of severe joint pain. Treatment included local ice, prednisone, methadone, instruction on joint preservation and proper body mechanics, and ambulation with weight-bearing as tolerated with an assistive device. At the patient's discharge, her joint inflammation was clinically improved but not resolved, and she was independent in transfers and ambulation with a walker for short distances. Despite ongoing inflammation, functional improvement was accomplished through a rehabilitation program emphasizing partial weight-bearing ambulation rather than strengthening exercises.
