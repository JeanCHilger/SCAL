Controversies in the management of pancreatic pseudocysts. Review of the diagnosis and treatment of patients with pancreatic pseudocysts over the past 8 years has led us to three conclusions regarding controversial aspects of their treatment. We found that patients who present with chronic pseudocysts can be identified with the help of computerized axial tomography and promptly undergo successful internal drainage, whereas patients with acute peripancreatic fluid secondary to pancreatitis can be observed expectantly with a 43 percent frequency of spontaneous resolution. Patients with infected pancreatic pseudocysts can be safely drained internally. The most common cause of extrahepatic biliary obstruction in this group of patients with pancreatic pseudocysts was stricture due to pancreatitis and fibrosis, not extrinsic compression.
