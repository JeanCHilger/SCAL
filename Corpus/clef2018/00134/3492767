Combined computerized tomography and angiography in evaluation of hemorrhage into pancreatic pseudocysts. Hemorrhage into a pancreatic pseudocyst is a rare but frequently lethal complication of pancreatitis, which remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Angiography alone or in combination with ultrasonography and radionuclide perfusion scans will occasionally fail to identify adequately the source of bleeding. We have presented a case illustrating the superiority of dynamic computerized tomography and angiography in the preoperative evaluation of a patient with pancreatic disease and upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage.
