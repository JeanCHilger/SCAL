Diagnostic yield of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in carcinoma of the pancreas. The results of 117 consecutive endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographic (ERCP) examinations in patients with adenocarcinoma carcinoma of the pancreas, performed over a six year period, are reported. The diagnostic accuracy of this procedure (80.3 per cent) was higher than that of computed tomography (63.6 per cent) and ultrasonography (54.0 per cent). Fewer false negative diagnoses were made by retrograde cholangiopancreatography (7.7 per cent) than with the other procedures (28 per cent each). Analysis of the total ERCP experience during the study period revealed a false positive rate for malignancy of 5.6 per cent. In situations where investigations are performed by individuals with a broad spectrum of expertise, ERCP is superior to other methods in diagnosing pancreatic carcinoma, even in areas with a high prevalence of chronic pancreatitis.
