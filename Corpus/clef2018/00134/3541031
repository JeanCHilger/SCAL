Gastrointestinal teratomas: CT and US appearance with pathologic correlation. Gastrointestinal teratomas are uncommon, benign neoplasms that occur primarily in children. A retrospective review of five cases (two gastric, one pancreatic, one mesenteric, and one in the lesser omentum) is presented with emphasis on the computed tomographic and ultrasonographic appearances. Principal findings are a well-defined mass with separate cystic and solid components of varying proportions, discrete areas with densities similar to that of fat, or coarse, globular calcifications within the solid component. Recognition of these findings may allow the radiologist to make a correct preoperative diagnosis of teratoma.
