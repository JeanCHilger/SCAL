MRI in organ transplantation. Experience with MRI in transplant patients is limited. The normal transplant kidney is characterized by a sharply defined corticomedullary border on T1 weighted images. Loss of CMC is seen in transplant rejection and in some patients with ATN. Presence of CMC does not rule out rejection, however. The spectrum of changes in cyclosporine toxicity is unclear, as only a few patients have been reported. For heart, liver, and pancreas transplantation magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging may prove useful in the evaluation of organ viability preoperatively and in early detection of rejection. Carefully designed prospective studies are needed to better define the role of MRI in organ transplantation.
