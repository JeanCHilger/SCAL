Cystadenoma and cystadenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Apropos of 7 new cases. Cystadenomas and cystadenocarcinomas of the pancreas are tumours which remain poorly known because of their relative rarity. They are seen essentially in women aged between 40 and 60 and involve the left half of the pancreas more often than the right. The symptomatology remains latent for a fairly long time, which explains the fact that they are most often discovered only at the stage of a palpable tumour. Recent methods of investigation--echotomography and computed tomography--are of very great value in preoperative diagnosis. It is extremely important to draw the distinction within the group of benign cystadenomas between microcystic forms and macrocystic forms or mucinous cystadenomas, the latter having a definite potential for malignant change, possibly explaining the link with certain cystadenocarcinomas. As a result, excision surgery is always preferable, when possible, to bypass surgery, at least in caudal or corporeo-caudal lesions, since excision surgery is usually easy. For cephalic lesions, if excision surgery seems difficult, it may be conceivable, using modern techniques of investigation, to adopt a conservative attitude when there are no features suggestive of potential malignant change.
