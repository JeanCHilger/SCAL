Surgical treatment of pancreatic cysts. The authors observed 103 cases of pancreatic cysts caused by acute pancreatitis, aggravation of chronic pancreatitis (81.0%) and trauma to the pancreas (12.0%). The posttraumatic cysts were more common in children and young adults (86.0%). The use of the complex method of diagnosis (x-ray examination of the gastrointestinal tract, celiacography, and upper mesentericography, endoscopic pancreatography, ultrasound echolocation of the pancreas) allowed to establish the diagnosis in 91.6% of cases. The external drainage of the cysts was carried out in cases of infected cysts with poorly formed walls. In case of a dilated and deformed main pancreatic duct with disorder of its patency (21 cases) the longitudinal cystopancreatojejunostomy was performed. The lethality after internal drainage constituted 2.4%. 80.8% of patients showed good long-term results of the treatment and 14.4%--showed fair results. 2 patients (2.1%) developed the recurrence of the cyst.
