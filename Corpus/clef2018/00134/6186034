Mediastinal pancreatic pseudocyst. We have described a case of extension into the mediastinum by a pancreatic pseudocyst. This rare phenomenon should be included in the differential diagnosis of mediastinal mass lesions. We advocate the use of CT in evaluating a mediastinal mass to determine its solid or cystic nature, size, extent, and relationship to adjacent structures.
