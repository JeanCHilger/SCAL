Symposium on pancreatitis: 3. Diagnostic tools in the management of chronic pancreatitis. The chief diagnostic tools used in planning the management of chronic pancreatitis require close collaboration of the surgeon and radiologist. Barium meal, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), ultrasonography and angiography are the most useful procedures. The barium meal is the initial screening procedure. Uultrasonography should follow if there is suspicion of a pseudocyst or pancreatic abscess. It is also may be of value in demonstrating localized chronic pancreatitis. The most useful of all the tests is ERCP. This shows the pancreatic duct, the common bile duct, or both ducts, so that the surgeon may avoid operation where there is no defect to correct, or it may guide him in selecting an operation that is designed to correct the anatomical abnormalities of either duct. Angiography is occasionally of use when the foregoing procedures have not provided enough information. In over 80% of patients it is possible for the surgeon to undertake an operation with foreknowledge of the pancreas that will help him select the correct procedure to alleviate the patient's symptoms.
