Diagnosis of endocrine gastrointestinal tumours. In 32 patients with endocrine gastrointestinal tumours angiography, CT, ultrasound examination, and in some cases phlebography with blood sampling for hormone analyses were compared with respect to diagnosis of the primary tumour and possibly existing liver metastases. Primary tumours in the pancreas and liver metastases could be diagnosed with CT and ultrasound, except for two small insulinomas, which required angiography.
