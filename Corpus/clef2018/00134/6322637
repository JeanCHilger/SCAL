Preoperative localization of insulinoma is necessary. Many insulinomas because of their small size are not localized by routine investigations: abdominal ultrasound, angiography, computed tomography, nor at the step of laparotomy. Biological diagnosis is far more encouraging. Percutaneous transhepatic sampling of blood in the portal venous system is very predictable for adenoma localization. Absolute reliability of this method remains to be established, nevertheless the observance of some basic requirements are already known: withdrawal of any drug interfering with insulin release several days before performing the catheterism need of a steady, preferably low, glucose level during the whole sampling
