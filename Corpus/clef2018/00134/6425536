An autopsy report of pancreatic carcinoma following the achievement of significant prolongation of survival, despite the lack of a definitive diagnosis. A 56-year-old female presented with chief complaints of epigastric discomfort and jaundice. Various examinations led to a differential diagnosis of carcinoma of she pancreas vs. malignant lymphoma. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy achieved a 50% reduction of the tumor mass and the disappearance of her jaundice. The patient survived for twenty-seven months following initial presentation. On post-mortem examination, she was found to have had carcinoma of the head of the pancreas. We studied the relationship between chemotherapy and the survival time in histologically diagnosed, unresectable pancreatic cancer at this hospital over the last ten years.
