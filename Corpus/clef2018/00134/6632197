Early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer: re-evaluation of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Of the 215 pancreatic ductal cancer patients for these 13 years, 154 cases undergoing ERCP were analysed. ERPs of the pancreatic cancers were classified into 4 types. 1) stenosis of the main pancreatic duct (M.P. D.) 2) obstruction of the M.P.D. 3) dilatation of the M.P.D. 4) abnormal pancreatic field (normal caliber of the M.P.D.) Most of the pancreatic cancers belonged to type 1) or 2). 7 cases were small pancreatic cancers less than 2 cm in diameter. Its pancreatograms showed type 1) or 2) and almost the same as the advanced ones. So it was easy to detect these types even in early stage. But there were a few small pancreatic cancers of which the pancreatogram showed type 4), and these cases were difficult to detect by other imaging modalities (U.S. or C.T.). Even these were easy to detect by ERCP. ERCP is the most potent diagnostic modality for an early pancreatic cancers.
