Role of angiography in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Endoscopic Retrograde Choledocho-Pancreatography, Ultrasonography and Computer Tomography can show dilated pancreatic duct in the patients with small resectable pancreatic carcinoma. However they can not predict the size of the tumor. Angiography is a complementary examination, being able to demonstrate the size of the tumor and predict its resectability.
