CT guided percutaneous fine needle biopsy in the diagnosis of small adrenal tumours. In the diagnosis of expansive lesions of the pancreas, liver, kidneys, lymph nodes and other organs, percutaneous fine needle aspiration biopsy has proved its value. For small objects computed tomography is particularly suitable as a localization aid. This article reports on the diagnostic advantages of CT and biopsy in the diagnosis of lesions of the adrenals, demonstrated by 6 selected examples of small tumours, 5 of them smaller than 2 cm., and 1 smaller than 3 cm. The cytological diagnosis of an adrenal adenoma in 5 patients and a metastasis in one provided an important contribution towards therapy and prognosis.
