Efficacy of computed tomography of the abdomen--early results. Our experience with 153 CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis over the first eight months of availability at our institution has been analyzed. The efficacy in terms of contribution to the diagnosis in each patient was assessed and accuracy determined. CT was found to have made a significant contribution to the diagnosis in patients with diseases of the pancreas, aorta, retroperitoneal structures, and in cases of abdominal and pelvic masses and abcesses. It has been somewhat less helpful in evaluation of liver and renal diseases. Overall, CT scanning appears to be a significant new diagnostic modality in the evaluation of patients with abdominal and pelvic diseases.
