Pseudocysts of the pancreas in children: which cases require surgery? The need for surgery in pancreatic pseudocysts in children is directly related to the status of the duct of Wirsung. Clinical deterioration was often the factor leading to surgery. The retrospective study of ten cases of pancreatic pseudocyst pointed to the value of ultrasound as an indicator of pancreatic duct involvement. CT was also of help in one case. ERCP, performed only in one patient before surgery, may be indicated in difficult cases.
