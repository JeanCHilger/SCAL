Computed tomography in surgical pancreatic emergencies. The findings observed with computed tomography (CT) in such pancreatic emergencies as necrotic-hemorrhagic pancreatitis, pancreatic abscess, broken pseudocyst, and pancreatic ascites with mediastinitis are presented. The value of CT in these conditions, which often require surgical intervention, is discussed. Computed tomography appears to be the ideal diagnostic procedure, especially for surgical treatment planning in pancreatic abscess. No deaths occurred in a group of pancreatic abscesses treated surgically with CT assistance.
