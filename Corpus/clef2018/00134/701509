Case report: computed tomography of cystadenoma of the pancreas. Cystadenoma is an unusual pancreatic tumor characterized by large-sized polycystic components. It is located totally within the pancreas and may cause retroperitoneal collateral venous return. These characteristics can be easily visualized by computed tomography, thus making it a very effective modality in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic lesions.
