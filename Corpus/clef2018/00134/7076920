Adrenal pseudotumors on computed tomography. Masses arising in the adrenal gland may be simulated on computed tomography (CT) by a number of anatomical structures and variations, and by certain pathological conditions in adjacent organs. These adrenal pseudotumors include the following: fluid-filled gastric fundus, prominent splenic lobulations, upper pole renal masses, tortuous splenic vessels, and pancreatic masses. These conditions, which represent pitfalls in the diagnosis of adrenal tumors on CT, are demonstrated and discussed. Certain guidelines will be discussed so that these potential pitfalls may be avoided.
