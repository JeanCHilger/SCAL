A case of papillary-cystic epithelial neoplasm of the pancreas. A 16-year-old girl presented with a left-sided abdominal mass. X-ray examination and computed tomography disclosed a well-defined tumor close to the tail of the pancreas, stretching the pancreatic branches from the splenic artery as demonstrated by arteriography. Ultrasonography suggested a partly cystic character. Cytologic fine-needle biopsy, histopathological and electron microscopical examination disclosed a cysto-papillary tumor, probably benign, and of an exocrine, ductular origin, and with pseudo-cystic areas similar to those found in adenoid cystic carcinoma of salivary glands. Immunohistochemistry did not demonstrate the presence of polypeptide hormones. The patient is without signs of tumor recurrence 18 months after operation.
