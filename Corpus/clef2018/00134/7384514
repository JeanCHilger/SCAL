The impact of new imaging methods on pancreatic arteriography. The use of computed tomography (ct) and ultrasound as imaging procedures for evaluating suspected pancreatic disease makes the use of arteriography unnecessary in most patients. CT, ultrasound, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography are usually definitive studies for diagnosis and choice of therapy. Arteriography is an important procedure for patients with rare vascular neoplasms or when CT and ultrasound findings are ambiguous.
