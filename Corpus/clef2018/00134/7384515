A comprehensive approach for diagnosing pancreatic disease. Diagnosis of a pancreatic disease should not be based primarily on angiographic or computed tomographic findings. The use of other modalities such as ultrasound, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, transhepatic cholangiography and biliary drainage, and percutaneous needle biopsy should be considered based on the patient's clinical problem, risk and cost of the study, and the applicability of the information that may be gained from the study.
