Fallopian tube carcinoma associated with retroperitoneal fibrosis. Primary carcinoma of the fallopian tube is not frequent and, thus, the diagnosis rarely is made preoperatively. We described a patient who had back pain, an epigastric abdominal mass, a palpable right kidney and a palpable scalene node. Because of upper gastrointestinal problems 1 year previously, a gastric or pancreatic malignancy was suspected after a scalene node biopsy revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, with the primary tumor unknown. Excretory urography, retrograde pyelography and computerized axial tomography confirmed the diagnosis of retroperitoneal fibrosis. It was only by laparotomy that the primary tumor was identified. The etiology, incidence, natural history, treatment and prognosis of fallopian tube carcinoma and retroperitoneal fibrosis are discussed.
