Tuberculosis of the pancreas. Tuberculosis of the pancreas is extremely rare. We report a case which demonstrates the diagnostic confusion which may arise in this condition. A 55-year-old alcoholic caucasian man presented with loss of weight and obstructive jaundice. Ultrasonography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and computed tomography showed a mass lesion in the head of the pancreas, diagnosed as probably malignant. He underwent a Whipple's pancreatoduodencetomy and made a good recovery. Histological examination showed typical features of tuberculosis. In the absence of other foci of active disease chemotherapy was not given. He remains well 12 months after operation.
