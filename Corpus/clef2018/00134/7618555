Diagnosis of duodenal leaks from kidney-pancreas transplants in patients with duodenovesical anastomoses: value of CT cystography. This study was undertaken to assess the value of CT cystography, using scans made with full bladder distention by a combination of iodinated contrast material and air and scans made after active voiding, for detecting duodenal segment leaks in patients with kidney transplants and pancreas transplants associated with small duodenal segments and duodenovesical anastomoses.18 patients with such kidney-pancreas transplants underwent CT cystography for clinically suspected leaks from the duodenal segment. Six patients had two examinations, resulting in 24 CT cystograms. The CT protocol consisted of an initial series of pelvic scans (plain CT) without oral, IV, or bladder contrast material CT cystogram with the bladder fully distended by iodinated contrast material and airOverall, bladder-duodenal segment leaks were demonstrated in 11 of 12 studies: one by plain CT, seven by full CT cystography, and four by CT after voiding following negative findings on full CT cystography. One surgically proved leak was missed by CT cystography owing to a large amount of pelvic fluid. In 12 studies without a leak, CT cystography results correlated well with clinical follow-up studies. There were no false-positive results. Sensitivity was 92%, specificity was 100%, and accuracy was 96%.CT cystography with a dedicated protocol is an accurate way to diagnose leaks of the duodenal segment in patients with bladder-drained kidney-pancreas transplants if administration of air combined with contrast material into the bladder and CT after voiding are used.
