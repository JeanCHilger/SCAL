Abdominal tuberculoma mimicking a pancreatic neoplasm: report of a case. We report herein a case of clinically solitary abdominal tuberculoma. A 28-year-old woman was admitted to hospital for treatment of an abdominal tumor shown to be located in the head of the pancreas and compressing the superior mesenteric vein by echosonography and computed tomography (CT). There were no clinical signs or symptoms of tuberculosis in the lungs or abdomen. Thus, under the diagnosis of a neoplasm of the pancreas, an exploratory laparotomy was performed which revealed tuberculosis. The patient made an excellent recovery on anti-tuberculous treatment, and no evidence of a tumor was seen on a CT scan performed 6 months after the initiation of treatment. Abdominal tuberculoma is often mistaken for a malignant neoplasm and the nonsurgical diagnosis of this entity continues to be a challenge.
