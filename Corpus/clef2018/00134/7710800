Focal fatty masses of the pancreas. Five patients with solitary fatty mass of the pancreas examined with CT and ultrasound (US) were evaluated. The areas of fat replacement were located in the pancreatic neck, body or tail. The size ranged from 4 to 30 mm in the longest diameter. The shape varied from roundish, to ovoid to semicircular, and the contour was universally well defined. The internal structure was homogeneous in 3 patients, but in one case there were thin septa and, in another, a slightly hyperdense part in the peripheral portion. All the masses except the smallest one were in part contact with pancreatic fat. CT showed fat with the same density as the peripancreatic fat and low HU units. The mass was hypoechoic in 2 cases and hyperechoic in one. The masses in the tail of the pancreas were not detected by US.
