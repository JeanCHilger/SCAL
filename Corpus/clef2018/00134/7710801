Dynamic high-field MR imaging in experimental porcine acute pancreatitis. The effects of acute pancreatitis on MR imaging signal intensities (SIs) were determined in an experimental study at 1.0 T. Oedematous pancreatitis was induced in 9 piglets and haemorrhagic pancreatitis in 11 piglets. Each animal served as its own control for MR imaging before and after induction of pancreatitis. T1-weighted spin echo (450/15 ms) and dynamic turbo FLASH (flip angle 8 degrees) sequences were used without contrast medium in testing the stability of the SI measurements. There was no significant difference in the SI-versus-time curves of the pancreas in piglets with oedematous and haemorrhagic pancreatitis. However, the difference in mean SIs between healthy and diseased piglets was significant. Thus, although non-contrast MR may be useful in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, it does not distinguish between oedematous and haemorrhagic pancreatitis.
