Lesser sac herniation through the greater omentum and gastro-pancreatic ligament: report of a case. We report herein the case of a woman who developed a lesser sac hernia which was especially unusual in that the small bowel prolapsed through a defect in the greater omentum and was thereafter strangulated by a hole in the gastro-pancreatic ligament. The gastro-pancreatic ligament has never before been documented as causing an internal hernia. In our patient, a plain abdominal X-ray demonstrated as soft-tissue mass displacing the stomach to the left while abdominal computed tomography and ultrasonography showed a sac-like encapsulation of the small bowel loops between the liver and stomach. Careful evaluation of these radiographic findings allowed for the preoperative diagnosis of a lesser sac hernia to be made.
