Tuberculous pancreatitis: a diagnostic problem. Case report and review of literature. A 22-year-old Pakistani man presented with a 1-year history of recurrent attacks of pancreatitis of unknown etiology that had required hospitalization and extensive investigation in Pakistan. He was admitted with abdominal pain, fever, and weight loss. An ultrasound and computed tomographic scan of the abdomen revealed abdominal lymphadenopathy, bulky and inhomogeneous pancreas, and a large fluid collection anterior to the right lobe of the liver. The collection was aspirated but Gram-stain, Ziehl-Neelsen stain for acid-fast bacilli, and DNA analysis by a highly specific polymerase chain reaction-based assay were negative. Because of a strong clinical suspicion of tuberculosis, the patient was started on antituberculous chemotherapy 4 weeks later the aspirate grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis (hominis). The patient improved rapidly and has remained well after 18 months follow-up. A high index of clinical suspicion and appropriate microbiological investigation is required for the diagnosis of this rare, but potentially curable cause of pancreatitis.
