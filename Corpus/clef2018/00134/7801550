Effectiveness of radiologic evaluation in the diagnosis of acute traumatic pancreatitis. Comprehensive radiologic examinations, including panoramic roentgenography, echography, computer-aided tomography, of 29 patients with acute traumatic pancreatitis that resulted from a combined closed injury of the abdomen, have demonstrated a high efficacy of computer-aided tomography in the detection of the type of changes in the pancreas and the retroperitoneal fat. Echography is advisable for cases when pancreas imaging seems to be possible. Radiologic findings completely coincided with the intraoperative ones.
