Images of pancreatic pathology: advantages and limitations of magnetic resonance compared with computerized tomography and ultrasound. We discuss the usefulness of MR examination in the diagnosis of pancreatic diseases, in addition to the other available imaging techniques. MR imaging yields important information in diagnosis and staging of pancreatic tumours, and in the characterization of pancreatic masses. MRI is also valuable for the study of chronic as well as acute pancreatitis, although there are some limits such as the poor detection of calcifications in the chronic, and the excessively long time required to complete the examination in the acute form.
