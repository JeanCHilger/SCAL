Pancreatic pseudocyst. A rare complication of polyarteritis nodosa. An 18-year-old male who developed a pancreatic pseudocyst during the active phase of polyarteritis nodosa is described. Cytotoxic therapy with cyclophosphamide and prednisolone was unable to control the manifestation of this disease, and he required percutaneous drainage of the pseudocyst.
