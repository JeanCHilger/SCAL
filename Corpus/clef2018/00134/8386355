Clinical evaluation of two- and three-dimensional imaging of helical scanning CT in the upper abdomen. To evaluate the usefulness of helical scanning CT of the upper abdomen, 30 patients with hepatic, adrenal, pancreatic and renal disease were examined using a Toshiba CT system, the Xforce. Helical scanning CT data were acquired using up to 20 continuous 1.5-second rotations, with a 1.5-3 ml bolus injection of contrast medium, and during a single breath-hold. Helical scanning provided both better data continuity and resolution than conventional scanning. The axial images with a slice thickness of 5 mm were not inferior in quality to equivalent images acquired by conventional CT, and multiplanar reconstruction images were superior. Targeted structures could be easily obtained because helical scanning CT permits image reconstruction in any direction. Using a CEMAX-VIPstation, we generated three-dimensional display images of high-density structures from the postcontrast data acquired with helical scanning. On these images, it was easy to observe the high-density tumors three-dimensionally and to determine the position of the tumors relative to the high-density surrounding organs. In conclusion, helical scanning CT was considered to be useful in clinical diagnosis involving the upper abdomen.
