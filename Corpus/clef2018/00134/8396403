CT, MR imaging and angiography in pancreatic apudomas. Findings at CT, MR imaging and angiography in 29 patients with pancreatic apudomas are presented. CT and angiography were performed in all the patients, MR imaging in 10. Twenty-five patients underwent laparotomy. The ability of the different imaging methods to localize the primary tumor and detect hepatic metastases was compared. CT and MR imaging depicted the primary tumor in 79% and 88% of the cases respectively, angiography in 72%. Enhancement patterns at CT and signal intensity variations at MR imaging were unspecific parameters regarding different types of tumors. CT and MR imaging were considerably more accurate than angiography in evaluating local tumor resectability. Angiography revealed more numerous small hepatic metastases (< 0.5 cm) than CT or MR imaging, but missed metastases in the left lobe in 5 patients. MR imaging seems promising in localizing and characterizing pancreatic apudomas, but further evaluation is needed before any conclusion can be drawn. At present dynamic incremental CT seems mandatory in the evaluation of pancreatic apudomas. Angiography is of value for preoperative and preembolization vascular mapping, and in localizing small pancreatic apudomas not shown at CT or MR imaging. Faster dynamic thin slice CT scanning and fast-sequence MR imaging may increase the sensitivity of detecting small primary pancreatic apudomas.
