Papillary-cystic neoplasm of the pancreas. Papillary-cystic neoplasm of the pancreas is a rare, nonfunctioning low-grade malignant tumor seen in young patients, most often female. Ultrasound and CT show a circumscribed, solid nonhomogeneous mass with cystic areas, with peripheral but not central enhancement and occasional calcification. Prognosis after excision is usually excellent. We describe a case of the papillary-cystic neoplasm of the pancreas in a 13-year-old girl to illustrate the radiological findings.
