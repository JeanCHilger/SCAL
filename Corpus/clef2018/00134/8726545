Permanent blindness after cyclosporine neurotoxicity in a kidney-pancreas transplant recipient. Blindness is an extremely rare complication of cyclosporine neurotoxicity. In all 10 cases in the literature, this form of blindness is completely reversible with the reduction or withdrawal of cyclosporine. We describe the first case of sudden, complete, and permanent blindness within 36 h after administration of intravenous cyclosporine in a kidney-pancreas transplant recipient.
