Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 associated with spinal ependymoma. A 51-year-old man was hospitalized with a gait disturbance and hypoesthesia below the level of his chest. These symptoms were due to a spinal tumor which was surgically resected and identified as an ependymoma. Additionally, the patient had hypercalcemia and a family history of insulinoma. An endocrine evaluation revealed parathyroid hyperplasia and a pancreatic islet cell tumor. Magnetic resonance imaging disclosed a pituitary microadenoma. He was diagnosed with spinal ependymoma and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1). A review of the literature revealed that chromosome 11q13 abnormalities have been reported in both ependymoma and MEN 1. We discuss the pathogenesis of these diseases.
