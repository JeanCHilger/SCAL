Laparoscopic diagnosis of blunt abdominal trauma in children. This study evaluates the safety and role of laparoscopy in the diagnosis of blunt abdominal trauma in children. Laparoscopy was performed in five patients aged 3 to 13 years because of persistent abdominal pain after blunt trauma. A laparotomy was not indicated from the physical examination, laboratory data, or radiologic findings. With the patient under general anesthesia, a 10-mm trocar was inserted through the umbilical fossa and the intra-abdominal organs were observed for 10 - 60 min under an insufflation pressure of 10 - 12 mmHg. The patients remained hemodynamically stable without pneumothorax development. Three patients underwent laparatomies: one, who had blood in the omental sac, had a duodenal injury with hemorrhagic necrosis and underwent a resection one with ascites and high amylase levels had an injury of the main pancreatic duct and underwent resection of the pancreatic tail
