A complex communicating bronchopulmonary foregut malformation: diagnostic imaging and pathogenesis. We report a newborn with an esophageal lung, a rare type of communicating bronchopulmonary foregut malformation (CBPFM). Associated findings included esophageal atresia, tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) to the distal esophagus, duodenal stenosis with annular pancreas, imperforate anus, vertebral anomalies and ambiguous genitalia. Radiologic evaluation included chest radiographs, esophagrams, chest ultrasound and chest CT. After colostomy and surgical repair of duodenal stenosis and TEF, a right thoracotomy was performed to treat an esophageal lung. Radiologic features of this unusual variant of CBPFM are presented. Accurate preoperative imaging diagnosis is essential for planning surgical treatment of an esophageal lung.
