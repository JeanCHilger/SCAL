Cystic gastric leiomyoma--a diagnostic pitfall. A case of a 74-year-old woman with a cystic calcified leiomyoma of the stomach is presented. The cyst was initially interpreted and treated as a pancreatic pseudocyst with repeated punctures and cystogastrostomy. Due to failure of elimination of the cyst, and because of infection, the patient underwent surgery. A discussion of the differential diagnoses and treatment is presented.
