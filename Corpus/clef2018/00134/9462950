Hydatid cyst of the head of the pancreas--a clinical case. Case report of a 41-year-old man, admitted because of intense sclero-tegumentar jaundice, epigastric pain and brings. The altered general state, because of obstructive jaundice (the total bilirubyne 9.6 mg%, with D 5.8 mg% and I 3.8 mg%, the alkaline phosphatase 650 u.i./l) determined the effectuation in emergency of an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, which included also a minipapilosfincterothomy. On obtained the spectacular improvement of the jaundice (the total bilirubyne 1.3 mg%) which permitted the extension of the imagistics explorations, establishing the diagnostic of cystic tumour of the head of the pancreas, but on could't specify the etiology. On made the surgical approach, founding a hydatic cyst of the head of the pancreas on practised the parasite inactivation, the cyst evacuation, pericysto-jejuno-anastomosis on a loop in Y "Ã  la Roux" and cholecysto-gastro-anastomosis. The postoperative evolution was favourable.
