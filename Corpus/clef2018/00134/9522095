Acute biliary pancreatitis: mini-invasive treatment. Acute biliary pancreatitis (ABP) still retains high morbidity (15-50%) and mortality (20-35%). Therefore it appears to be crucial clearly assessing the aetiological factors (50% of idiopathic are in fact biliary pancreatitis) and establishing the severity in order to plan the appropriate treatment. Forty-nine ABP patients were diagnosed by ultrasound (75.5%) or by laboratory findings (22.5%). Following Ranson and APACHE II scoring, 15 cases (30.6%) were classified as severe, 34 (69.3%) as mild. All patients with severe ABP had emergency ERCP + ES (within 24-48 hours) followed by LC (< or = 10 days). Patients with mild ABP had LC within 10 days in these cases IOC was always done. In severe cases operative endoscopy cured pancreatic inflammation in 11 cases. Subsequent LC never showed serious morbidity, but subcutaneous emphysema in one case. In 4 cases laparotomy was required since pancreatic necrosis was present, with 75% mortality. In patients with mild pancreatitis LC was successfully performed in all cases, with 8.8% morbidity. IOC showed choledochal stones in 32.5% of cases, while in severe cases stones in the biliary tree were showed in 80% of cases. In conclusion ABP treatment is always surgical, and almost always with minimally-invasive procedures in severe cases (ERCP + ES with LC < or = 10 days) if surgery is performed within 24-48 hours as well as in mild cases (LC + IOC) when surgery is done within 10 days.
