Single shot MRI cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) with a "fast acquisition spin echo" sequence (FASE). Replacement of ERCP?. 118 Patients with suspected obstruction of the biliary tract of pancreatic duct were examined to evaluate the accuracy of MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) in comparison with diagnostic findings in endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).Using a 0.5-Tesla MR imaging system (FLEXART, Toshiba) and a QD body-coil, a recently developed heavily T2-weighted fast acquisition spin echo sequence (FASE) was applied. In this FASE sequence two significant features are implemented. A fast spin-echo (SE) sequence allows a large number of echos and conjugate K-space filling speeds up data acquisition. Thus, the acquisition time of single-shot breath-hold images takes only 3 seconds, which makes MRCP a feasible technique even in elderly or suffering patients. There is no need for time-consuming postprocessing procedures.In all MRCP examinations images of satisfactory quality were obtained. In cases of obstruction of the biliary or pancreatic duct, locations and lengths of stenoses were correctly demonstrated. Gallstones within the gallbladder or in the extrahepatic bile ducts were also properly visualised in MRCP. Stenoses caused by non-depicted pancreatic carcinoma, gallbladder carcinoma, or segmental pancreatitis were reliably shown.Even if MRCP will not replace ERCP, a number of clinical applications for non-invasive MRCP examination arise: primary diagnosis in patients with obstructive jaundice, obstruction of the biliary or pancreatic duct, if ERCP is not possible due to anatomic reason and in patients scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
