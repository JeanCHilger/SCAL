T1-weighted dynamic MRI with new superparamagnetic iron oxide particles (Resovist): results of a phantom study as well as 25 patients. Evaluation of the diagnostic usefulness of the T1-effect of Resovist (SPIO) for dynamic MRI of the liver.In-vitro measurements of a dilution series with T1-weighted FLASH and SE sequences and investigation of 25 patients with known focal liver lesions with a T2-weighted TSE sequence and a dynamic T1-FLASH sequence.T1-weighted MRI with Resovist in vitro showed a positive enhancement at low concentrations and a negative enhancement at higher concentrations. In-vivo T1-weighted dynamic MRI liver parenchyma demonstrated a positive enhancement 30 s post contrast, followed by a continuous slope of signal intensity and a negative enhancement (> or = 60 s). Spleen, portal venous vessels and haemangiomas showed an early increase in signal intensity followed by a decreasing positive enhancement, but without negative enhancement. During the perfusion phase metastases showed a small but not significant increase in signal intensity. In 80% a positive ring enhancement could be observed around metastases.Resovist exhibits a diagnostically useful T1-effect. An evaluation of the perfusion of focal liver lesions during the distribution phase is possible with dynamic T1-weighted MRI. This approach may further improve characterisation of focal liver lesions.
