Benign mesenteric schwannoma: MRI findings. Accurate differentiation of retro- or intraperitoneal localization of a primary abdominal tumor by US and CT is often difficult. In our case an abdominal mass was incidentally discovered and identified as a typical benign schwannoma, but with a very atypical location in the mesentery. We found that MRI was a valuable adjunct to CT for exact tumor localization.
