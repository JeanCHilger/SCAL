Mucosecretory and papillary intraductal tumors of the pancreas: clinicopathological considerations and radiological aspects including computed tomography symptomatology. Intraductal papillary-mucinous tumor of the pancreas (IPMT) is an uncommon entity, defined as an intraductal papillary proliferation of mucin-producing epithelial cells. Since the original description of the disease by Ohhashi in 1982, the definition and the classification of the disease has remained confused until the recently published classification of the World Health Organisation (WHO). The purpose of this article is therefore to report the clinico-pathological features of IPMT according to the WHO classification, to illustrate the radiological features especially the computed tomographic signs and to discute of the treatment.
