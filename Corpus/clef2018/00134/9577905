MRCP (magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography)--an assessment of current status. For the first time, magnetic resonance cholangiopancretography (MRCP) provides images of the biliary and pancreatic ducts based on 3D data similar to those we are used to from endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC). Extraordinarily impressing is the fact that no contrast media have to be applied. The following manuscript shows technical basics and the development of this technique from gradient echo sequences to the recent single-shot techniques. Furthermore possibilities and limitations of MRCP will be discussed with respect to certain illnesses.
