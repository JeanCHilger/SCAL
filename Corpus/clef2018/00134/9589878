Adrenal pheochromocytoma associated with renal cell carcinoma: report of two cases. Two cases of adrenal pheochromocytoma associated with renal cell carcinoma are reported. The first case was in a 56-year-old woman who had been treated for hypertension. Computerized tomography (CT) scan revealed a right renal tumor and a right adrenal mass. Endocrinological examination and 131I-MIBG scintigraphy confirmed the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Right radical nephrectomy was performed under stable blood pressure. The second case was in a 45-year-old man who had been treated for gastric ulcers. CT scan incidentally revealed a right renal tumor and a left adrenal mass. He was normotensive and endocrinologically normal. Right radical nephrectomy and left adrenalectomy were performed, followed by corticosteroid supplementation. In both cases, histopathological diagnosis was renal cell carcinoma and adrenal pheochromocytoma. Both patients had no clinical evidence for von Hippel-Lindau disease such as tumorous lesions of the central nervous system, spinal cord and retina, and cystic lesions of the kidney and pancreas.
