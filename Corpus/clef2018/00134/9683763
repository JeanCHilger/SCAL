Effective TAE therapy using Lipiodol with epirubicin for liver metastases of nonfunctioning islet cell carcinoma of the pancreas. We report the response of two patients with advanced nonfunctioning islet cell carcinoma of the pancreas with liver metastases treated with a combination of surgi-cal resection and transarterial embolization (TAE), using Lipiodol with epirubicin. After pretreatment evaluation, the two patients were diagnosed with nonfunctioning islet cell carcinoma of the pancreas with liver metastases. Preoperatively, in both patients, TAE was performed through the hepatic arteries, using Lipiodol and sponzel plus epirubicin. Surgical resection of the primary tumor (radical distal pancreatectomy and pancreaticoduodenectomy) was performed. After surgical resection and evaluation of the malignant histopathological features of the neoplasms, chemotherapy, which included oral 5-fluorouracil (FU), and transarterial infusion therapy, using Lipiodol with epirubicin, was administered to the patients. Follow-up evaluation of the two patients by computerized tomography (CT) scan showed a reduction in the size of the metastatic hepatic masses after several chemoembolizations through the hepatic arteries. This combined treatment modality may be an effective therapeutic strategy for improved management of patients with advanced nonfunctioning islet cell carcinoma of the pancreas with liver metastases.
