Carcinoma of the pancreas associated with anomalous junction of pancreaticobiliary tracts: report of two cases and review of the literature. We report two cases of carcinoma of the pancreas with anomalous junction of the pancreaticobiliary tracts. A 71-year-old Japanese woman had obstructive jaundice. Ultrasonography showed a hypoechoic mass in the pancreatic head and computed tomography demonstrated a low-density nodule in the pancreatic head. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography displayed a double duct sign and an anomalous junction of the pancreaticobiliary tracts. The patient underwent a pancreatoduodenectomy. The histopathologic diagnosis of the resected specimen was adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head. A 56-year-old Japanese man also developed obstructive jaundice. Ultrasonography and computed tomography showed a huge mass almost replacing the whole pancreas and involving the superior mesenteric artery, splenic artery, splenic vein, and portal vein. Multiple hepatic metastases and peritoneal dissemination were present. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography demonstrated an anomalous junction of the pancreaticobiliary tracts. The patient died of hemorrhage from esophageal varices. We discuss the relationship between the anomalous junction of the pancreaticobiliary tracts and pancreatic carcinoma.
