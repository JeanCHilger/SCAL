Results of surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy for pancreatic cancer. We retrospectively reviewed the cases of 34 patients with pancreatic cancer who underwent resection between January 1988 and December 1996. Adjuvant radiotherapy was performed in 24 patients, with 13 receiving both intra- and postoperative radiotherapy, 2 receiving postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) alone, and 9 receiving intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) alone. The 1- and 3-year survival rates for all 34 patients were 59% and 19%, respectively, with a median survival of 13 months. At the time of the analysis, three patients were still alive. Recurrence patterns were assessed in 25 patients who had had no distant metastases at the time of surgery, had survived more than 3 months after surgery, and had undergone close surveillance for recurrence. Based on computed tomography (CT) and autopsy findings, a total of 15 (60%) of these 25 patients had local recurrence, 13 (52%) had liver metastases, and 8 (32%) had both. Eight (62%) of the 13 patients who received IORT and/or PORT developed local recurrence, and we failed to detect any survival advantage of IORT and/or PORT over surgery alone. However, autopsies revealed a suppressive effect of radiation on cancer growth, and local recurrence was not considered to be the direct cause of death in any of the patients, nor did any of the patients develop gastrointestinal obstruction due to local recurrence. The incidence of liver metastasis in the patients with and without tumor invasion of the portal system was 80% (8/10) and 33% (5/15), respectively. The patients who did not develop liver metastasis had significantly longer survivals than who did. Further improvements of survival await effective prophylactic treatment for liver metastases.
