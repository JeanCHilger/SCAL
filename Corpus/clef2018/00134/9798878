Torsion of intraperitoneal renal transplants: imaging appearances. Torsion of a renal transplant is a rare complication with nonspecific clinical manifestations. Prompt detection is necessary to allow surgical treatment and to preserve renal function. We describe the radiologic appearances of torsion of intraperitoneal renal transplants in patients who have undergone simultaneous renal and pancreatic transplantation or dual renal transplantation.Renal transplant torsion should be suspected when a change in renal axis associated with abnormal perfusion occurs in an intraperitoneal kidney.
