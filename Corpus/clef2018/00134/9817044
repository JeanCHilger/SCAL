Abdominal tuberculosis. A case report. Tuberculous involvement of the abdominal parenchymatous organs is usually a diffuse process. The macronodular form of hepatosplenic tuberculosis and focal involvement of the pancreas are extremely rare. This report describes CT findings of abdominal parenchymatous organ involvement in a patient with pulmonary and vertebral tuberculosis. Although CT does not confirm a diagnosis of abdominal tuberculosis, it is a valuable examination that can support the diagnosis and define the extent of disease.
