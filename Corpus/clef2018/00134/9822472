Ultrasound-directed percutaneous endoscopic cyst-gastrostomy for the treatment of a pancreatic pseudocyst. The incidence of pseudocysts in patients with chronic pancreatitis ranges from 20-40%. Unlike pseudocysts associated with acute pancreatitis, these do not usually resolve spontaneously. Traditionally, these cysts were drained surgically. More recently, however, they have been successfully managed with endoscopic drainage. This report reviews the history and results of nonsurgical pseudocyst management and describes a case of drainage obtained using an alternative method of ultrasound-directed percutaneous endoscopic cyst-gastrostomy.
