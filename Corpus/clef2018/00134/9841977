Utility of a linear array ultrasound endoscope in the evaluation of suspected pancreatic disease. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is currently being used to evaluate and stage pancreaticobiliary malignancies and neuroendocrine tumors, and to perform aspiration for cytologic diagnosis. There are currently two different commercially available EUS systems for clinical use. One system uses a mechanical radial sector scanner oriented in a plane perpendicular to the long axis of the endoscope, and the other uses an electronic convex scanner that is oriented in the long axis of the endoscope. The vast majority of the current literature reports experience using the radial scanning device in the evaluation of pancreaticobiliary abnormalities. We prospectively evaluated the linear probe as the sole instrument for EUS in 26 patients with suspected pancreatic disease. The results of the endoscopic ultrasound examination were compared with the results of surgery or long-term clinical follow-up. The sensitivity and specificity of linear array EUS for benign pancreatic disease were 93.8% and 88.2%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity for malignant disease of the pancreas were 80.0% and 88.9%, respectively. The linear array echoendoscope, employed as the only instrument for evaluation of the pancreas, is accurate in the evaluation of pancreatic disease. The addition of EUS-guided pancreatic biopsy would be anticipated to improve the sensitivity of the linear array instrument for detecting malignancy.
