Cystic tumours of the pancreas: a diagnostic dilemma. Cystic neoplasm of the pancreas is an uncommon entity that encompasses a range of tumours with varying potential for malignancy. These tumours are frequently misdiagnosed as pseudocysts and are inappropriately managed.A retrospective review was undertaken of 18 cases of cystic tumours of the pancreas over an 8-year period in two large hospitals in Singapore.All patients were Asian, with a younger age group (mean 43.5 years) and a lesser degree of female predominance (3.5:1 ratio) compared to other series. Pain was the most common symptom. Pre-operative diagnosis using ultrasound and computed tomography was not diagnostic in half of the cases and misdiagnosed as pseudocyst in a sixth. There were five serous cystadenomas, four mucinous cystadenomas, two mucinous cystadenocarcinomas, one mucinous cystadenocarcinoma with cystic degeneration in a ductal adenocarcinoma, three Frantz tumours, one acinar cell tumour, one glucagonoma, and one benign epithelial cyst. Two-thirds of tumours were malignant or had the potential to become malignant. Resection was curative in all cases, and no recurrence was noted at a mean follow-up of 34.5 months.The difficulties with pre-operative diagnosis, the high incidence of tumours with potential malignancy, and the good outcome with resection, suggest that all suspected cystic tumours of the pancreas should be resected.
