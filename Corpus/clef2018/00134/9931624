Progress in diagnostic imaging in the area of the pancreas (CT, MRI, MR-angio, hydro-CT, MR cholangiopancreatography). Advances in diagnostic pancreas imaging concern the MRCP and SCT. Both methods must be performed with the best possible strategy. For MRCP, this means the oral application of a superparamagnetic contrast medium and the i.v. injection of SekretolinR. The SCT requires a two-phase technique with sufficient contrast medium and flow after bolus tracking. It is to be expected that MRCP will replace diagnostic ERCP. Although the results of MRI are similar to SCT, it still cannot replace this method due to the considerable costs and long examination times. The diagnostical procedure has to be applied prior to possible stent implantation to avoid artifacts caused by the manipulation.
