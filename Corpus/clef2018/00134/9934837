Splenic artery aneurysm associated with systemic lupus erythematosus: report of a case. We herein report on a 64-year-old Japanese female patient who presented with a splenic artery aneurysm (SAA) associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The saccular aneurysm, which measured 3 cm in diameter, was located in the proximal third of the splenic artery from the pancreas with a portosystemic shunt. A double ligation of the splenic artery (the distal and proximal sides of the aneurysm) was performed without a splenectomy. The postoperative course showed acute pancreatitis without either splenic infarction or portal thrombus. To our knowledge, the closed association of SLE with an aneurysmal dilatation of the splenic artery has not been previously reported. Both the pathogenesis and the management of SAA associated with SLE are discussed following the presentation of this case. This is the first reported case of SAA associated with SLE.
