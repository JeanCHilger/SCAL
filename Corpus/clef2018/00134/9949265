Role of chemoembolization in synchronous liver metastases from pancreatic endocrine tumours. Endocrine tumours of the pancreas, even in case of liver involvement, are generally characterized by a slower evolution and a better prognosis, if compared with ductal carcinoma. This fact gives reason to a radical surgical approach, whenever possible, and to the research of any effective adjuvant treatment. For this purpose, hepatic transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has been proposed in recent years for the treatment of metastatic endocrine tumours. Out of 80 patients suffering from endocrine tumours of the pancreas, observed between January 1985 and December 1996, 28 (35%) presented liver metastases at the time of diagnosis. Twelve of these patients were submitted to palliative resection of pancreatic tumour and one or more cycles of TACE. Overall survival was 50% (6/12) median survival was 35.4 months (range 4-75). These results suggest that chemoembolization, combined with surgical resection of primary malignancy, appears to be able to control the disease for a certain time and to increase the survival rate.
