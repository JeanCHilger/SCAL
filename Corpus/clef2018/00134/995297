Tumors of the head of the pancreas. Echographic diagnosis. The diagnostic possibilities in cancer of the head of the pancreas offered by radiography, angiography, isotopic and endoscopic investigations (with respective accuracy percentages) are examined and a new technique based on the use of ultrasounds is presented. Echography exploits the different structures of tissues by reflecting the ultrasound beam which strikes them in a different way, providing a bidimensional tomographic picture of the surface explored with echostructural profiles and characteristics of the organs. The personal series, together with pictures and percentages of correct diagnosis, is presented. It is concluded that the technique is one of the most suitable for exploring the pancreatic region.
