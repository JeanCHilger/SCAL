Sclerosing mesenteritis seen clinically as pancreatic pseudotumor: two cases and a review. Sclerosing mesenteritis is an uncommon nonneoplastic inflammatory process in the mesentery that is seen as a pseudotumor, usually involving the small bowel mesentery, the mesenteric fat, and less commonly, the mesentery of the large bowel. We report two cases of sclerosing mesenteritis and review the literature on this rare disease. Both patients had pain, profound weight loss, and a mass on computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen. The provisional diagnosis was pancreatic neoplasm on the basis of clinical presentation and imaging studies. The diagnosis of sclerosing mesenteritis was established by histologic findings in biopsy material obtained at laparotomy in both cases. Interval histologic studies in one patient who had a high CA 19-9 level, progressive biliary ductal and partial duodenal compression, revealed a transitional histologic pattern from predominant inflammation and fat necrosis to predominant fibrosis. This may explain the varied descriptive terms used in the literature to describe this entity.
