Treatment of acute biliary pancreatitis in the aged in the endolaparoscopic era. Acute biliary pancreatitis (ABP) still retains high morbidity (15-50%) and mortality (20-35%). Therefore it appears to be crucial to clearly assess the aetiological factors (50% of idiopathic are in fact biliary pancreatitis) and to establish the severity in order to plan the appropriate treatment.In this study we have considered 61 patients divided into 2 groups. Group 1 had 29 ABP patients aging less than 65 years, group 232 patients aging more than 65 years the diagnosis was made by ultrasound and serological values in 78.5% of cases, while in the remaining 21.5% was only serological. Following Ranson and APACHE II scoring 18 cases (29.5%) were classified as severe [6 (20.6%) in group 1In severe cases operative endoscopy cured pancreatic inflammation in 13 cases. Subsequent LC never showed serious morbidity, apart subcutaneous emphysema in one case. In 5 cases laparotomy was required since pancreatic necrosis was present, with 60% mortality. In patients with mild pancreatitis LC was successfully performed in all cases, with 6.9% morbidity. IOC showed choledochal stones in 32.5% of cases, while in severe cases stones in the biliary tree were showed in 88.8% of cases. No significant differences were detected between group 1 and 2.In conclusion ABP treatment is always surgical, and almost always with minimally-invasive procedures in severe cases (ERCP + ES with LC < or = 10 days) if surgery is performed within 24-48 hrs as well as in mild cases (LC + IOC) when surgery is done within 10 days, independently from the age of the patients.
