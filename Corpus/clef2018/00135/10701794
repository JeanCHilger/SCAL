Pancreatic pseudocyst masquerading as an incarcerated inguinal hernia. We present a case in which a pancreatic pseudocyst dissected into the right inguinal region, thus masquerading as an incarcerated right inguinal hernia. Computed tomography (CT) confirmed the diagnosis of a pseudocyst, and the patient was treated successfully with percutaneous drainage.
