Prevalence of malnutrition and morphofunctional alterations of the pancreas in asymptomatic chronic alcoholic patients. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of morphofunctional alterations of the pancreas and the possible association with the nutritional status of chronic alcoholic subjects in the initial phase of detoxification and without symptoms of pancreopathy.105 alcoholic patients with neither diagnosis nor clinical symptoms of pancreopathy were studied, from detoxification units for alcoholics with over 30 days abstinence. The nutritional status was evaluated by means of clinico-anthropometric parameters (body mass index, nutritional risk index, degree and type of malnutrition) and biological parameters (albumin, transferrin, and total lymphocyte count). The pancreas was morphologically examined by means of plain X-rays, ultrasonography and/or computer tomography, applying the Cambridge criteria also functionally (Pancreolauryl test and fats in stools).The average (SD) consumption of alcohol was 195 (76) g/day (range 60-450), for 16 (8) years (3-40). Nutritional abnormalities were observed between 12.3% and 28% in the clinico-anthropometric parameters, and between 2% and 32% according to the biological parameters. These abnormalities were only light or moderate. The morphologic study showed abnormalities in 3.5% of the cases. Abnormalities in the exocrine function were observed in 26% of the cases, of which one third showed steathorrhea. A significant association between the nutritional condition and the scores of the tests of exocrine function was observed, especially in those cases with steathorrea.A large number of asymptomatic alcoholic subjects present a subclinical pancreopathy and signs of malnutrition. Both facts may be related and justify a pancreatic examination with more sensitive techniques in alcoholic individuals with malnutrition.
