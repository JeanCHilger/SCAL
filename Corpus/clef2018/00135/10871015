Bilateral pituitary adenomas occurring with multiple endocrine neoplasia type one. We report a case of synchronous bilateral pituitary adenomas in a patient with multiple endocrine neoplasia type one (MEN1). The patient was previously known to have a pancreatic gastrinoma and had first-degree relatives with MEN1. Both adenomas were concurrently revealed by high-resolution MR imaging of the pituitary gland as part of the investigation of the patient's severe, persistent headaches and elevated serum prolactin level.
