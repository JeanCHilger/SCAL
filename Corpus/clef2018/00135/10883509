Severe acute pancreatitis. Clinical and therapeutic contribution of diagnostic imaging. Ultrasonography and dynamic tomography are used in the study of acute pancreatitis, thus helping to interpret the diverse anatomophysiopathologic variables. We present 41 patients studied by ultrasonography, on admission and twenty-four hours later or more. After seventy-two hours, a dynamic tomography was performed. We did a clinicotomographic correlation assessing necrosis, and multiple Ranson criteria, being complemented with the anatomopathologic study of specimens both in the complications and in the elective biliary surgery. There were three puncture aspirates for bacteriology. Eight (19.5%) patients developed local complications and four (9.75%) presented organ failure. Ultrasonography showed biliopancreatic hypertension in 45% of cases of biliary pancreatitis and was reversible in nature. Dynamic tomography was important in defining morphology and pancreatic necrotic involvement. There were two patients with intrapancreatic necrosis, six with intra and extrapancreatic necrosis and eleven patients who presents a dissemination of the process into the extrapancreatic tissues. The prevalence of glandular necrosis was 24%. Both, ultrasonography and dynamic tomography allowed to the identify a spectrum of lesions representative of cavitated extrapancreatic necrosis and enzymatic pericholecystitis. Likewise, they contributed to define medical treatment as well as indications, opportunities and approaches in the surgical and/or percutaneous treatment of septic complications.
