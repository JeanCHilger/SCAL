Functional MR-pancreatography with secretin. A comparison of imaging quality and diagnostic value. The aim of the present study was to assess imaging improvement and diagnostic value of secretin stimulated MR-pancreatography (MRP) compared to conventional MRP.50 patients were studied with a 1.0 T system using a single-shot-TSE sequence (RARE). Imaging quality and diameter of the different parts of the pancreatic tract and diagnoses were monitored before and after secretin.The visualization of the normal main pancreatic duct (MPD) was improved significantly in head, body and tail. Side branches were not depicted at all. Even in chronic pancreatitis a significant improvement of imaging quality could be observed, but only in patients without duct dilation before secretin. In advanced disease with duct dilation, secretin stimulation provided no further diagnostic improvement.In conclusion, secretin increases the diagnostic value of MRP especially in patients with normal or non-dilated native MPD and may help to avoid unnecessary invasive procedures such as ERCP.
