MRI-cholangiopancreatography characteristics of cystic pancreatic tumors. The purpose was to assess the value of MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) to evaluate the diagnosis and surgical resectability of pancreatic cystic tumors.For MRCP, thick RARE and thin HASTE heavily T2-weighted sequences were performed with a 1.5 Tesla MR unit in 42 patients. Diffusion-weighted echo-planar sequences were performed in 16 patients. Surgical and histopathological correlation was obtained in 15 patients.MRCP detected all cystic lesions of the pancreas: 15 intraductal papillary mucinous tumors, 10 serous cystadenomas, 2 benign mucinous cystadenomas, 1 solid pseudopapillary tumor and 14 small cystic lesions (less than 2 cm) with no clinical signs. MRCP provided complete visualization of the pancreatic duct, showed excrescences within the dilated main or branch pancreatic ducts, identified microlacunar mixed and macrolacunar patterns, as well as septa, communications and stenosis, without contrast agent. MRCP did not characterize serous or mucinous cystic lesions. Specific diagnostic criteria of the various types of intraductal papillary mucinous tumors were noted (main duct, branch duct and combined types) and illustrated with the imaging findings necessary for accurate differential diagnosis.MRCP is a useful noninvasive and essential method in preoperative staging of cystic tumors of the pancreas it is a reasonable alternative to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and endosonography, as it provides the necessary information for treatment: surgical decision and/or follow-up.
