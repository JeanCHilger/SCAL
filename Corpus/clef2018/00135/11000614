Mucinous tumors of the exocrine pancreas. Mucin-producing cystic neoplasms of the pancreas account for 1% of all malignant tumors of the pancreas. They include mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs) and mucinous ductal ectasia (MDE), also known as intraductal mucin-hypersecreting neoplasms.This review focuses on the clinical presentation, the role of diagnostic imaging modalities, and cyst fluid analysis preoperatively in the differentiation between these tumors and other nonneoplastic cysts of the pancreas.MCNs and MDE evolve from pancreatic duct epithelium, produce an abundance of mucin, and are considered premalignant or malignant. While MCNs affect primarily middle-aged women with lesions occurring predominantly in the body and tail of the pancreas, MDE affects primarily men in the sixth or seventh decade with lesions more often located in the head of the pancreas.All mucin-producing cystic tumors of both types require surgical resection because they are frankly malignant or premalignant. Survival rates of both tumors are better than those reported for ductal cell carcinomas. Future studies are needed to improve the accuracy of diagnosing these tumors preoperatively.
