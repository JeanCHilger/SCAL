A case of biliary carcinoid presenting with pancreatitis and obstructive jaundice. A 43-yr-old man presented to the clinic with abdominal pain, jaundice, nausea, and vomiting and weight loss over a 6-month period. Physical exam was unrevealing other than mild epigastric tenderness. A computed tomographic scan of the abdomen revealed a mass in the head of the pancreas, which was resected at laparotomy by a Whipple's procedure. The histology showed a biliary tract carcinoid tumor. The patient had normal hydroxy-indole-acetic acid (HIAA) levels throughout. There has been no evidence of disease or tumor recurrence at 3.5 yr of follow up.
