A case report of cribriform carcinoma of the pancreas with long time survival. A 62-year-old man had complained of left abdominal pain and tenderness and a body weight loss. Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography revealed homogeneous tumor with clear margin, and an irregular shape (3.5 x 2.0 cm) in the body of the pancreas. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography showed a shadow defect in the main pancreatic duct adjacent to the tumor, which suggested intraductal tumor spread. Distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy and left paraaortic lymph node dissection was performed. Microscopically, the tumor showed microtubular carcinoma, which was characterized by a cribriform pattern, medullary growth, and little interstitium. The tumor was encapsulated by a relatively thick fibrous capsule. The patient was discharged uneventfully, and he is alive 33 months after operation without a distinct sign of recurrence. In conclusion, cribriform carcinoma of the pancreas has specific characteristics, such as good prognosis, expansive growth with little invasion, intraductal growth and spread without mucin production and histological marked cribriform pattern. This type of carcinoma should be classified as a new disease entity of carcinoma of the pancreas.
