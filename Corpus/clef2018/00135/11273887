Von Hippel-Lindau disease masquerading as autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. The diagnostic confusion in differentiating the various causes of renal cystic diseases in adults is well documented. This confusion can include misclassifications between autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL). We describe such a case of VHL. A review of the literature and of the patients in our database regarding typical features of each disease, mean age of onset, and frequency of these features was undertaken to provide helpful differentiating features. Pancreatic cysts are one differentiating feature. In VHL, pancreatic cysts can occur in 70% of patients, often are multiple, and rarely may cause exocrine or endocrine insufficiency. Pancreatic islet cell tumors occur. In ADPKD, pancreatic cysts are found in only 9% of patients, usually are single and asymptomatic, generally occur in conjunction with cystic liver disease, and are not found in children or unaffected family members. Pancreatic malignancies do not occur with increased frequency in ADPKD. A different pattern, especially in patients without a strong family history of ADPKD, may be a clue to VHL masquerading as ADPKD. Genetic mutation screening of the VHL gene should be used in these patients.
