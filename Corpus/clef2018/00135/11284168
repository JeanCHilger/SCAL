Gastroduodenal artery pseudoaneurysm ruptured at the pancreatic head. The presence of splancnic aneurysms associated with pancreatitis represents an uncommon evidence (10%) but extremely formidable for the high mortality related to the elevate risk of rupture (50%). A case of a broken gastroduodenal artery pseudoaneurysm plugged in the pancreatic head in a patient with chronic pancreatitis surgically treated is reported. The Authors believe that in presence or in suspicious of peripancreatic pseudoaneurysm bleeding, showed by abdominal echography or CT scan, is mandatory the execution of splancnic and peripancreatic vessels angiography to determine the correct localization of the aneurysm, essential to determining the best surgical treatment. Gastroduodenal artery before the origin from the right epatic artery has been tied in presence of an anatomic variant of origin and division of the hepatic arteries, previously showed with the angiographic examination. The exclusion and the complete thrombosis of the false aneurysm was demonstrated with the intraoperatory Doppler control and confirmed by CT scan before the dismission. This surgical strategy avoid a pancreatic resection, potentially burdened from an higher risk of mortality and morbidity as than the artery exclusion.
