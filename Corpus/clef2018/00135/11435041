Efficacy of three-dimensional fast imaging with steady precession dynamic MR imaging in evaluating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. To compare the diagnostic efficacy of three-dimensional fast imaging with steady precession (3D-FISP) dynamic MR imaging in assessing pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with conventional MR imaging and helical CT, 15 patients with surgically proven pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma were studied. Contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the tumor, tumor detectability, local tumor extension, and vascular involvement were evaluated for all techniques. The results indicate that 3D-FISP dynamic MR imaging may improve the imaging assessment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
