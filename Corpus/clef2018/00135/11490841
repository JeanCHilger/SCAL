CT and MR imaging of pancreatic cancer. Recent improvements in imaging techniques have made it possible to improve the diagnostic accuracy for detection, staging, and indicating surgical resectability of pancreatic cancer. The latest advance in the computed tomography technique, is the introduction of subsecond multislice helical scanning that improves z-axis resolution in the reformatted images and three-dimensional rendering with a large volume data. Magnetic resonance imaging provides versatile information including magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography that allows noninvasive delineation of the pancreatic and biliary duct systems. The presence of pancreatic cancer may best be evaluated by dynamic computed tomography or dynamic magnetic resonance imaging with administration of intravenous contrast material. Both computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are valuable for the preoperative assessment of local invasion and vascular involvement. Multislice helical computed tomography is currently considered as the best single modality for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer as it provides excellent image quality. When advanced magnetic resonance imaging equipment is used as a primary modality, in the future, it may have a possibility to replace other imaging modalities.
