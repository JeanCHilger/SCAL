Clinical applications of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a novel imaging technique used for noninvasive work-up of patients with pancreaticobiliary disease. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography is useful in the evaluation of a host of pancreaticobiliary disorders, such as congenital disorders, calculus disease, biliary strictures, sclerosing cholangitis, chronic pancreatitis, and cystic pancreatic lesions. It not only provides useful preoperative information to surgeons and gastroenterologists but also serves as a valuable tool in the assessment of postoperative pancreaticobiliary ductal anatomy. Recent refinement of techniques allows faster imaging with superior image resolution. This review summarizes the role of MRCP in clinical practice.
