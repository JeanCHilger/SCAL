An intrapericardial teratoma with endocrine function. Intrapericardial teratoma was diagnosed in a nine-year-old male infant with a three-month history of labored breathing and cough. The tumor was completely resected and found to be a mature teratoma, containing pancreatic tissue and producing insulin. A few glucagon and somatostatin containing cells were also present in the periphery of the islets. Postoperative course was uneventful. This is to our knowledge, the first report of an intrapericardial teratoma with such endocrine activity.
