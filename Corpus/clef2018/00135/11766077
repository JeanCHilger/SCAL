Spontaneous rupture of the pancreaticoduodenal artery possibly related to prior occlusion of the common hepatic artery: report of a case. We report herein a case of spontaneous rupture of the pancreaticoduodenal artery (PDA) associated with obstruction of the common hepatic artery. A 68-year-old man was admitted to our hospital following the sudden onset of severe upper abdominal pain. Computed tomography revealed a large mass formation in the peritoneal cavity. Hemorrhagic shock rapidly developed during the initial evaluation, necessitating an exploratory laparotomy to be performed in the emergency room. This revealed a large hematoma in the retroperitoneal space, and a ruptured PDA was sutured. Postoperative angiography showed obstruction of the common hepatic artery and also suggested that the source of the bleeding was the PDA. Thus, a diagnosis of spontaneous rupture of a PDA aneurysm associated with occlusion of the common hepatic artery was made. Following this case report, we discuss the development of true aneurysms of the PDA and the treatment of ruptured true PDA aneurysms resulting in shock.
