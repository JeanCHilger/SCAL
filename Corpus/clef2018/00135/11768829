Solid and papillary epithelial neoplasms of the pancreas: aggressive resection for cure. Solid and papillary epithelial neoplasms of the pancreas (SPENP) are extremely rare and usually affect young women. We retrospectively reviewed our experience with pancreatic neoplasms from 1986 to the present and identified nine patients with SPENP. All nine patients were female with a mean age of 32 years (range 16-66). All patients presented with gastrointestinal complaints including pain, mass, dyspepsia, or bloating and were subsequently diagnosed with a tumor of the pancreas by CT scan. All patients underwent surgical resection. Two patients had tumors located in the head of the pancreas and underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy. The remainder had tumors located in the tail of the pancreas and underwent distal pancreatectomy. Pathology demonstrated solid and papillary or solid and cystic pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas. Three tumors were positive for both vimentin and alpha-1 antitrypsin on immunohistochemical studies, and three were positive for neuron-specific enolase. All nine patients underwent curative resection and are alive without any evidence of recurrence with a mean follow-up of 5.4 years. SPENP is considered to be a low-grade malignancy with an excellent prognosis. Prompt diagnosis and surgical resection can result in cure.
