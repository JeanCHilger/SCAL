Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography diagnosed pancreatitis associated choledochal cyst: report of one case. This report describes a 6-year-old girl with a choledochal cyst associated with recurrent pancreatitis. A cystic dilatation of the common bile duct was detected by abdominal ultrasound and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). She displayed only one of the classic triads: abdominal pain plus pancreatitis. Cyst excision and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy was indicated in this case. MRCP can be considered as a unique non-invasive tool and the first choice in evaluation of choledochal cyst in pediatric group.
