Ventral pancreas-preserving pancreatic head and body resection. A new procedure that included ventral pancreas-preserving pancreatic head and body resection for a huge mucinous cystic neoplasm was performed to preserve pancreatic function. A 45-year-old man was diagnosed as having a huge mucin-producing pancreatic neoplasm. The ventral pancreas-preserving pancreatic head and body resection was performed. The stumps of the caudal pancreas and the uncinate process were negative for cancer by frozen-section histology. The remaining pancreas was anastomosed by a method of double pancreatojejunostomy with a Roux-en-Y loop. The resected specimen was 15 x 10 cm in size and contained mucin. The papillary tumor was 5.0 x 4.5 x 3.0 cm in size, which was an intraductal papillary adenocarcinoma without pancreatic invasion microscopically. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged 14 days after surgery. Glucose tolerance test was normal 24 months after surgery and both sides of the pancreatic duct were patent confirmed by magnetic resonance. The patient is well now two years after surgery. A new limited pancreatic resection, ventral pancreas-preserving pancreatic head and body resection, was safely applied to a huge mucinous cystic neoplasm of the pancreas.
