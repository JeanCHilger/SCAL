Prospective evaluation of pancreatic tumors: accuracy of MR imaging with MR cholangiopancreatography and MR angiography. To prospectively assess accuracy of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), and MR angiography in patients suspected of having pancreatic tumors.Sixty-six patients suspected of having pancreatic tumors underwent MR imaging (unenhanced and contrast material-enhanced MR, MRCP, and contrast-enhanced MR angiography). Two blinded readers prospectively analyzed the images by consensus, and results were correlated with surgery, biopsy, or follow-up findings. Results were tabulated in two-by-two tables.MR assessment of pancreatic lesion status (differentiation of benign vs malignant) resulted in 60 correct diagnoses (accuracy, 91%), and six (10%) false diagnoses. Among histologically proved malignant tumors, MR imaging yielded correct diagnoses in 42 of 44 patients (sensitivity, 95% 95% CI: 85%, 99%), whereas 18 of 22 patients with benign findings were classified correctly. At MR imaging, findings in four patients with chronic pancreatitis were wrongly categorized as malignant tumors (specificity, 82%Unenhanced and contrast-enhanced MR imaging with MRCP and MR angiography offers potential as a noninvasive tool for assessment of patients suspected of having pancreatic tumors.
