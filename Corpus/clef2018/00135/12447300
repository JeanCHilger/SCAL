The rate of false-positive results with EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration. The aims of this study were to determine the rate of false-positive diagnosis with EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration and to identify factors contributing to this type of error.The records of 577 patients undergoing EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration were reviewed and a subset of 188 patients with malignant cytology who underwent surgery was identified. Operative histopathology was compared with EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration cytopathology and false-positive cases were identified. An experienced cytopathologist, who was not involved with the original interpretation of the specimens, reviewed these cases to identify any factor(s) contributing to the errors.Three cases of false-positive diagnosis were identified (1.6% 95% CI [0.3%, 4.6%]). By aspiration site, the false-positive rates were as follows: pancreas 2/39 (5.1%), 95% CI [0.6%, 17.3%]The overall rate of false-positive diagnosis for EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration is similar to that reported for other modalities. Most false-positive diagnoses are caused by interpretation errors.
