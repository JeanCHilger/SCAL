Pancreatic pleural effusion with a pancreaticopleural fistula diagnosed by magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and cured by somatostatin analogue treatment. A 69-year-old man with chronic alcoholic pancreatitis developed a left-sided massive pleural effusion. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography clearly demonstrated the pancreatic cyst and the fistula connecting the cyst with the left pleural cavity, resulting in the diagnosis of pancreatic pleural effusion with a pancreaticopleural fistula. Conservative somatostatin analogue treatment completely eradicated the pancreatic pleural effusion and closed the pancreaticopleural fistula.
