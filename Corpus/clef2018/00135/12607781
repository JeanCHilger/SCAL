Endoscopic ultrasound techniques for pancreatic cystic neoplasms. The role of EUS and EUS FNA in the evaluation of cystic pancreatic lesions is evolving. The detailed imaging provided by EUS and hence the ability to target the biopsy at suspicious areas within the pancreatic cystic lesion may prove to be invaluable. Improvements in EUS equipment will further secure the role of this technology when evaluating these patients.
