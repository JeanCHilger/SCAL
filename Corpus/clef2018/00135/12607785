The role of laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasound in the diagnosis of cystic lesions of the pancreas. With the widespread use of advanced imaging techniques, cystic lesions of the pancreas are now diagnosed relatively frequently. The nature of these lesions vary from benign cysts (serous cvstadenoma) or an inflammatory process (pseudocyst), to premalignant (mucinous cystadenoma) or frankly malignant lesions (cystadenocarcinoma). Differentiation of various types of pancreatic cysts presents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge, as clinical presentation may be vague. Laparoscopic ultrasonography (LAPUS), the biopsy of the cystic wall, and analysis of the cystic aspirate, although expensive and rather invasive procedures, significantly contribute to the differential diagnosis of pancreatic cystic lesions.
