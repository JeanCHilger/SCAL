Solid and papillary epithelial neoplasm of the pancreas in an 11-year-old girl: case report and literature review. An 11-year-old girl presented with episodic abdominal pain of 2 years' duration. CT scan of the abdomen showed a mass in the tail of the pancreas. A distal pancreatectomy was done and the tumor was excised. Macroscopic and immunohistochemical studies were compatible with a solid and papillary epithelial neoplasm. This is a rare neoplasm with a decidedly female predominance. It has a very low malignant potential with a good prognosis. Surgical removal of the tumor is usually curative.
