Presence of microcysts within a cystic tumor of the pancreas does not rule out malignancy: report of two cases. Presence of microcysts within a cystic tumor of the pancreas is usually considered as specific of serous cystadenoma and leads to conservative management and surveillance of asymptomatic patients. We report two cases of malignant cystic tumors of the pancreas with a microcystic component detected by endosonography. We conclude that presence of microcysts detected by endosonography in cystic tumors of the pancreas does not rule out malignancy.
