Computed tomographic evaluation of advanced gastric cancer. Pre-operative CT of 75 gastric cancer lesions in 74 patients were evaluated for CT diagnosis of N-factor, n-factor and pancreatic invasion. 1. Sensitivity of CT diagnosis of N-factor was depended upon the size of the lymph node Group A, where all nodular density within the fat plane of anatomical lymph node location were called abnormal, revealed 73.8% sensitivity. Sensitivity of group B was 69.8%, group C was 60.4% and group D was 28.6%. Pre-education of operators did not significantly affect the sensitivity. 2. CT detected No. 3, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14, and 16 in higher sensitivity, and No. 2, 4, 5 and 15 in lower sensitivity as N-factor. 3. Overall CT sensitivity of n-factor diagnosis was 48.5% and specificity was 95.6% and accuracy was 88.5%. No. 3, 7 and 8 showed higher sensitivity and specificity, but low sensitivity and specificity were noted at No. 1 and 4. 4. Pancreatic invasion was evaluated objectively from ROC, and sensitivity was 80.0% and 73.3% with and without operative findings, respectively.
