Spiral CT of the pancreas with multiplanar display. This essay illustrates the findings obtained with spiral CT imaging in pancreatic disease. Features of spiral CT--fast scanning, dynamic injection of contrast material allowing optimal vessel opacification, and supplemental multiplanar imaging--promise to provide increased accuracy in the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic disease. With further development of continuous (spiral/helical) scanning technology, this technology should expand to cover a wider range of applications.
