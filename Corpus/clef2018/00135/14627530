Laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasonography in judging the resectability of pancreatic head cancer. To explore the clinical value of laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasonography (LUS) in judging the resectability of pancreatic head cancer.LUS was employed as a prospective diagnosis of tumor staging before exploratory laparotomy in 22 patients diagnosed with pancreatic head cancer to identify whether the liver and peritoneum had small metastases or local invasion to the portal vein, superior mesenteric vessel, aorta, inferior vena cava.In the 22 patients receiving laparoscopy and LUS, we found peritoneal or surface liver metastases (3 patients), hepatic parenchyma metastases (1), and pancreatitis proved by biopsy under ultrasound guidance (1). Laparotomy was avoided in these 5 patients. Of the remaining 17 patients, 8 patients, including 2 patients with portal vein emboli due to tumor metastases had hypertrophic lymph nodes or tumor invasion of local vessels in the peritoneal cavity, retroperitoneum, and omentum and the other 9 patients had resectable tumors shown by LUS. The 17 patients were subjected to exploratory laparotomy, and pancreaticoduodenectomy was successful in 8 patients.Laparoscopy and LUS can be used to precisely estimate the possibility of resection of pancreatic head cancer, and prevent unnecessary exploratory laparotomy and its complications. It can be used as a routine examination before exploratory laparotomy.
