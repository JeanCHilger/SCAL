Small size cephalo-pancreatic cancer. Demonstration of MRI/MRCP usefulness. 48 years old woman with obstructive jaundice has been examined by abdominal ultrasound followed by MRI. The suspicion of cephalic pancreatic cancer raised by ultrasound was confirmed by MRI and MRCP. Association of MRCP with axial and coronal T1 and T2 sequences successfully demonstrated a resectable tumor, confirmed at surgery. MRI/MRCP is demonstrating great potential in predicting resectability of cephalic pancreatic tumors.
