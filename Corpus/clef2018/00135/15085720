Solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas: 5 case reports. Solid pseudopapillary tumor of pancreas belongs to rare tumors of exocrine pancreas, which typically affects young women. In a retrospective study the authors reviewed their experience obtained with five cases of this tumor from 1994 until the present time. The group included four women (from 16 to 47 years, mean age 25 years) and one man (43 years old). Clinical symptoms were characterized by abdominal pain in three cases, two years lasting domed belly and an incidental finding in another case. The palpation examination of epigastrium revealed a palpable tumor, visible in sonographic examination and CT. All patients underwent surgical resection of the tumor. The tumor affected cauda of the pancreas (pancreatic tail) in four cases and head of the pancreas in one case. Histopathological examination established the diagnosis of solid pseudopapillary tumor of pancreas in four cases and solid pseudopapillary carcinoma in one case. A typical immunophenotype of tumorous cells was demonstrated and in four cases there was positivity of progesterone receptor. The progesterone and estrogen receptors were negative in the male patient. Solid pseudopapillary tumor of pancreas is the tumor of low malignancy with excellent prognosis. Correct diagnosis and surgical removal of the tumor results in curing up in most cases.
