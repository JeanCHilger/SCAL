A case of gastric GIST treated preoperatively by imatinib mesylate. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), the most common mesenchymal tumor of the human gastrointestinal tract, is thought to originate from the interstitial cells of Cajal. The mutation of c-kit, cording KIT, is essential in the development of GIST. Imatinib mesylate (IM), an agent for chronic myeloid leukemia, was reported to inhibit tyrosine kinase activity of KIT and to be highly effective for GIST. We report, here, a case of huge gastric GIST who underwent neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgical resection. The patient was a 62-year-old man with GIST in cardia (KIT+, CD34+, mitotic rate 5/50 HPF), whose chief complaint was general fatigue. Because the huge tumor, 7.5 cm in size, directly invaded the pancreas, total gastrectomy with distal pancreatosplenectomy was necessary for curative resection. IM was administered (400 mg/body/day) as a neoadjuvant treatment for down-staging of the tumor. Leucopenia (grade 2) and diarrhea (grade 1) were observed as the adverse effects of IM. Partial response was obtained. He underwent proximal gastrectomy without pancreatosplenectomy since CT no longer showed direct invasion to the pancreas. Histological examination of the resected specimen revealed the extensive degeneration of the tumor, in which tumor cells containing condensed nuclei had decreased remarkably. Interestingly, mitotic rate decreased to 0/50 HPF in the effective area of the resected specimen, indicating that recurrent risk might be decreased. A part of the viable tumor cells, however, had the same feature to that in the biopsied specimen before treatment. The results suggest that the heterogeneity of GIST induces different sensitivity to IM. The postoperative course was uneventful and no sign of recurrence was observed 3 months after surgery. Neoadjuvant therapy with IM may become a useful strategy for GIST, as it reduces the tumor size and decreases the recurrence rate.
