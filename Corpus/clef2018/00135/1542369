2 patients with a non-Hodgkin lymphoma located in the pancreas. A small percentage (around 1.5%) of pancreatic malignancies are well treatable non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Two patients with this disease are described. One patient was treated with both surgery and chemotherapy, the other with chemotherapy only. The results in both patients were excellent with complete responses being achieved. The literature on pancreatic non-Hodgkin's lymphomas is reviewed.
