Differential diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and focal pancreatitis by using EUS-guided FNA. Despite advances in diagnostic imaging techniques, the differentiation between pancreatic cancer and focal pancreatitis remains difficult. This study evaluated the effectiveness of EUS-guided FNA in the differential diagnosis between pancreatic cancer and focal pancreatitis, with particular reference to detection of the K-ras point mutation.The study included 62 consecutive patients with pancreatic ductal cancer and 15 patients with focal pancreatitis demonstrated as a pancreatic mass lesion by EUS.Sensitivity, specificity, overall accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of cytopathologic diagnosis were 82%, 100%, 86%, 100%, and 58%, respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, overall accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of histopathologic diagnosis were 44%, 100%, 55%, 100%, and 32%, respectively. The K-ras point mutation was found in 74% of pancreatic cancers and 0% of focal pancreatitis lesions. No complication of EUS-guided FNA was observed.EUS-guided FNA is useful for the differential diagnosis of pancreatic mass lesions caused by pancreatic cancer and focal pancreatitis. Analysis for the K-ras point mutation in specimens obtained by EUS-guided FNA may enhance diagnostic accuracy in indeterminate cases.
