Hyperadrenocorticism in a dog due to ectopic secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone. Spontaneous hyperadrenocorticism in dogs is known to be the result of excessive secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by the pituitary gland or excessive autonomous glucocorticoid secretion by an adrenocortical tumor. Here, we report on an 8-year-old German shepherd dog in which ACTH-dependent hyperadrenocorticism was a result of ectopic ACTH secretion and could be related to an abdominal neuroendocrine tumor. Hyperadrenocorticism was diagnosed on the basis of the history, clinical signs, and elevated urinary corticoid/creatinine ratios (UCCRs 236 and 350 x 10(-6)
