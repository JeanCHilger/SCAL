Hemosiderosis in thalassemia major. Quantitative study with magnetic resonance (MR). Hemosiderosis, which results from transfusional therapy and from increased absorption of dietary iron, is a severe complication of thalassemia major. The complication is also very difficult to manage. An accurate determination of the total amount and of the distribution of body iron stores is essential for prognostic purposes and to evaluate the efficacy of chelation therapy. Therefore, a suitable tool for the noninvasive depiction of iron overload is to be hoped for. MR imaging has been usefully employed, of late, to this purpose. Sixteen thalassemic patients have been studied to evaluate iron depositions using a 1.5 T magnet. Signal intensities from liver, pancreas, spleen, bone marrow, and heart were considered. The signals were dramatically lower than the normal values obtained in a sex- and age-matched group the differences were due to the iron. Iron distribution appeared inhomogeneous, with the highest overload in liver and bone marrow. Since cardiomyopathy represents the first cause of death in thalassemic patients, the relationship between cardiac function and iron overload in the heart has been thoroughly investigated. Finally, the authors conclude that MR will become a widely employed method for assessing iron overload and will contribute to improve the management of thalassemia major.
