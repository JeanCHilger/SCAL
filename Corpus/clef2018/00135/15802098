An endoscopic perspective on pancreatic pseudocysts. Significant advances in endoscopic, radiologic, and surgical techniques have transformed the management of pancreatic pseudocysts. The present review focuses upon advances in the endoscopic management of pseudocysts and incorporation of these techniques into an overall management approach. Findings with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography often guide the choice of drainage method. Endoscopic drainage can be achieved through the transpapillary or transmural routes. EUS has increasingly become an integral part of transmural pseudocyst drainage.
