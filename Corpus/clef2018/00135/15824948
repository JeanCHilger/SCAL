Puncture of solid pancreatic tumors guided by endoscopic ultrasonography: a pilot study series comparing Trucut and 19-gauge and 22-gauge aspiration needles. The aim of this prospective study was to compare endoscopic ultrasonography-guided Trucut needle biopsy (EUS-TNB) with EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (EUS-FNAB) using 19- and 22-gauge needles for biopsy from different sites in patients with solid pancreatic cancers.Sixteen consecutive patients with masses in the uncinate process (n = 3), the head (n = 5), or the body and tail (n = 8) of the pancreas underwent both EUS-TNB and EUS-FNAB. The specimens obtained were evaluated by histopathological analysis aloneTissue specimens were obtained by Trucut needle, and by 19-gauge and 22-gauge aspiration needles in 69 %, 69 %, and 100 % of patients respectively. Sensitivity for malignancy was 69 % for all needles. Tissue sampling by Trucut and by 19-gauge aspiration needle from masses in the uncinate process was impossible. The sensitivity of the Trucut and 19-gauge aspiration needles was 100 % in the 11 patients with successful procedures. If Trucut or 19-gauge aspiration needles had been used for body and tail masses, and the 22-gauge aspiration needle for masses in the uncinate process and head, the sensitivity for malignancy would have been 81 %.EUS-TNB allows reliable tissue sampling for the diagnosis of pancreatic masses, but its use is limited to lesions in the body and tail of the pancreas. EUS-FNAB using a 22-gauge needle may be useful for accurate diagnosis in some patients with masses in the uncinate process or the head of the pancreas.
