Comparison of qualitative and quantitative measurements on unenhanced T1-weighted fat saturation MR images in predicting pancreatic pathology. To evaluate the accuracy of signal intensity (SI) analysis on unenhanced fat-suppressed T1-weighted MR images in the diagnosis of pancreatic disease and to compare subjective interpretation with different quantitative measurements.The pancreas was evaluated in 159 patients (86 normal and 73 with pancreatic disease) with spoiled gradient echo (GRE) T1-weighted fat saturation MR images. The relative SI of the pancreas to liver and spleen was quantitatively measured using regions of interest (ROIs) and qualitatively assessed by two independent observers.The mean values between a normal and an abnormal pancreas with pancreas-liver ratios of 0.14 +/- 0.37 vs. -0.32 +/- 0.24, respectively, and pancreas-spleen ratios of 0.89 +/- 0.55 vs. 0.02 +/- 0.43, respectively, were significantly different (P < 0.001). The pancreas-liver SI ratio was significantly better than the pancreas-spleen ratio throughout the disease group (area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve +/- SD 0.92 +/- 0.02 for pancreas-liver vs. 0.86 +/- 0.03 for pancreas-spleen, P < 0.01), and after excluding cases of acute pancreatitis (0.96 +/- 0.02 for pancreas-liver vs. 0.89 +/- 0.03 for pancreas-spleen, P < 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference between quantitative and qualitative analysis (area under the ROC curve +/- SDThe pancreas-liver ratio is the best quantitative means of distinguishing normal from abnormal pancreas. Visual observation by experienced observers (qualitative measurement) was just as accurate as quantitative measurement. Detection of pancreatic pathology can be made with high accuracy by visually comparing the SI of the pancreas with that of the normal liver.
