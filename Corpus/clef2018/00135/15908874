Lymphoepithelial cyst of the pancreas: a case report. Lymphoepithelial cyst is a rare benign dysembryoplastic lesion of the pancreas, difficult to diagnose before surgery. The authors report the case of a 44 year old man with low left sided chest pain. CT-scan described a multilocular cystic tumor of the tail of the pancreas. The patient underwent a distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy. Histologic analysis led to the diagnosis of lymphoepithelial cyst of the pancreas. Through this observation, the authors stress the value of imaging in this benign entity that must be considered when evaluating a cystic pancreatic lesion because a different therapeutic approach may be required.
