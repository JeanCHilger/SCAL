Aneurysms of the pancreaticoduodenal artery in association with stenosis or occlusion of the celiac trunk. On the basis of an analysis of 69 patients including 2 personal observations the authors discuss the questions of pathogenesis, clinical picture, diagnosis and treatment of aneurysms of the pancreaticoduodenal artery in association with stenosis or occlusion of the celiac trunk (CT). A description of 2 cases with a true not broken aneurysms of the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery and subocclusion of the celiac trunk is given which was caused by compression of the latter by the median arcuate ligament of the diaphragm and neurofibrous tissue of the celiac plexus. These patients were detected as a result of examinations and operative treatment of 556 patients with compressive stenosis of the celiac trunk for the period from 1982 through 2002. In one case a transcatheter embolization of the aneurysm was fulfilled followed in 3 months by a compression of the celiac trunk, in the other case a compression of the celiac trunk was made first and then in 5 months it was followed by resection of the aneurysm with a favorable outcome.
