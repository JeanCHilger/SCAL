Focal FDG uptake in a pancreatic lipoma mimicking malignancy. Positron emission tomography (PET) using the glucose analog 18-F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) is commonly obtained to stage patients with cancer. Benign lesions can be a source of false-positive PET examinations, leading to incorrect staging and treatment of tumors. Computed tomography can aid in distinguishing between certain benign and malignant lesions. The authors report a case of a pancreatic lipoma producing a false-positive PET examination.
