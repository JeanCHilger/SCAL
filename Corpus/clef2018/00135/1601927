Spontaneous rupture of a mucinous cystadenoma of the pancreas and suppuration in the abdomen. The spontaneous rupture and the suppuration of a mucinous cystadenoma of the pancreas remain exceptional. The authors report about one case. The help provided by ultrasound and computed tomography for the diagnosis is indisputable. The condition is most often mistaken with a pseudocyst of the pancreas. This case is used as a basis to study the mechanism of suppuration and discuss the merits of an emergent histological diagnosis to choose an appropriate therapy.
