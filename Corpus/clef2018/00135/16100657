A case of a small cell lung carcinoma presenting with jaundice due to pancreatic metastasis. Though the high incidence of pancreatic metastasis of lung cancer has been reported in autopsy series, symptomatic cases with jaundice due to that is very rare. Dominant histological type with pancreatic metastases is small cell carcinoma and prognosis is poor. Hereby, we report a case initially presenting with gastroenterologic symptoms as jaundice, nausea, vomiting, weight loss and abdominal pain and then diagnosed as primary small cell carcinoma of the lung with metastasis to pancreas. He underwent a palliative surgery due to obstructive jaundice. This presented case is a rare one with its priority of gastroenterologic symptoms rather than pulmonary complaints.
