Intraductal papillary mucinous tumours of the pancreas: imaging features. IPMTP is a pancreatic duct disease that can better be diagnosed due to advances in imaging techniques. This probably explains the recent increased frequency of this disease. Enlargement of the main pancreatic duct and/or branch ducts is a typical feature. CT and MRI with MRCP are useful for diagnosis. Features of malignant degeneration are better known. Preoperative staging is performed at CT. Differential diagnosis includes main pancreatic duct dilatation and pancreatic cysts. Recent papers indicate that isolated side branch IPMTP is less frequently malignant. Surgery is indicated in the presence of acute pancreatitis or suspicion of malignant degeneration. Imaging is useful for the follow up of patients with isolated side branch IPMTP. In this paper, the diagnostic, staging and malignant features of IPMTP will be reviewed.
