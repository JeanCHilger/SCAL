Endovascular treatment of splenic artery aneurysms. To assess the feasibility and effectiveness of endovascular treatment of splenic artery aneurysms (SAAs).Between May 2000 and June 2003 we treated 11 true SAAs in 9 patients (7 females and 2 males mean age 58 years), 8 saccular and 3 fusiform, 4 located at the middle tract of the splenic artery, 5 at the distal tract and 2 intra-parenchymal. The diagnosis was performed with colour-Doppler ultrasound and/or CT-angiographyTechnical success was observed in all cases (in 10/11 at the end of the procedure in 1/11 at CT performed 3 days after the procedure). The follow-up (mean 18 monthsUsing different techniques, endovascular treatment is feasible in nearly all SAAs. It ensures good immediate and long term results, and no doubt presents some advantages in comparison to surgical treatment, as it is less invasive and allows the preservation of splenic function.
