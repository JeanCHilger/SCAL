A rare cause of mediastinal expansion with a massive pleural effusion. The authors present a case of a 53 year old woman, who was admitted to hospital because of an unusual cause of massive pleural effusion. During diagnostic examination the mediastinal propagation of the pancreatic pseudocyst was discovered as a complication of the chronic calcifying pancreatitis. The patient was operated on and the pseudocyst was resolved by Roux-en-Y cystjejunostomy. The diagnostics and treatment of this unusual pancreatic pseudocyst spreading is discussed.
