Laparoscopic distal pancreatic resection. Laparoscopic resection is not an established treatment for pancreatic tumors. Previous reports, mainly in Europe and Japan, have demonstrated the potential utility of laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (LDP). However, few reports have been published from the United States. We instituted a pilot program to assess LDP. A total of 11 patients were included from December 2003 to December 2004. All patients were staged with preoperative endoscopic ultrasound and received vaccinations for possible splenectomy. The indications for surgery were as follows: neuroendocrine tumor (n = 7), unspecified tumor (n = 1), and cystic neoplasm (n = 3). All procedures began with diagnostic laparoscopy and intraoperative ultrasound. Three patients underwent laparoscopic enucleation of a discrete pancreatic nodule. In eight patients, LDP was attempted. One patient required conversion to an open procedure. In the other seven patients, the procedure was completed laparoscopically, two with hand-assist. The average operative time was 5 hours and 3 minutes average length of stay was 5 days
