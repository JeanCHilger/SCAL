SonoCT improves on conventional ultrasound in the visualization of the pancreatic and bile duct: A pilot study. In sonographic diagnostic investigation, evaluation of the ductus Wirsungianus and the ductus hepatocholedochus plays an important role. The present prospective study sought to establish whether SonoCT can improve on conventional B-mode sonography in the visualization of the pancreatic and bile duct.In the pilot study, ductus Wirsungianus and ductus hepatocholedochus of 14 healthy volunteers were assessed by an experienced and an inexperienced examiner, respectively, using both traditional B-mode sonography and SonoCT. Assessment was based on a predetermined set of criteria.Both examiners were able to determine duct structures significantly more effectively using SonoCT. Compared with traditional B-mode sonography, the use of SonoCT also led to significant improvements in terms of delineation and clarity of representation in both ductus Wirsungianus and ductus hepatocholedochus.SonoCT yields better results than conventional B-mode sonography in terms of delineation, visualization of borders and artefact-free representation of both ductus Wirsungianus and ductus hepatocholedochus. Appropriate training and experience of the examiner, however, remain key prerequisites for success in evaluating pathological changes of the ducts. Future studies will be needed to determine whether certain diseases can be diagnosed more readily using SonoCT rather than conventional sonographic technique.
