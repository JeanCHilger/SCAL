Pancreatic tumors: diagnostic patterns by 3D gradient-echo post contrast magnetic resonance imaging with pathologic correlation. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has considerable potential in characterizing pancreatic masses. Certain features can be used by the radiologist to establish a definitive diagnosis for most pancreatic tumors including ductal adenocarcinoma, islet cell tumors, solid and papillary epithelial neoplasms, micro- and macrocystic adenoma, and metastases. Recognition of these tumors on imaging is important since it often changes the treatment approach and may obviate the need for surgery. Recent introduction of 3D gradient recalled echo (GRE) sequence such as volumetric interpolated breath hold examination (VIBE) has dramatically improved MR imaging by providing dynamic enhanced thin-slice images with fat saturation and high signal-to-noise ratio. In this article, special emphasis will be placed on the impact of 3D GRE sequence in the diagnosis of pancreatic neoplasms with pathologic correlation.
