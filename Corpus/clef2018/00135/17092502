Current advances in the surgical approach to abdominal trauma. The management of abdominal injury has changed dramatically during the past two decades. This review examines the historic perspectives and recent developments of diagnosis and treatment of liver injuries, splenic injuries, and pancreatic injuries. The incorporation of non-operative management for liver injuries has had a very positive effect on mortality. Likewise, splenic conservative therapy is routinely used. The early treatment of pancreatic injury has changed very little however, the ability to recognize these difficult injuries has improved with higher quality CT scanning. The authors present their preferred treatment for these three common types of abdominal solid organ injury and present an illustrative case example.
