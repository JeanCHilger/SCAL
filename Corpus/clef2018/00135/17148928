A case of minimal invasive carcinoma from intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm with invasive ductal carcinoma of the pancreas. A 69-year-old man was referred to our hospital for epigastralgia. He was found to have elevation of serum amylase and CA19-9. Ultrasonography, abdominal CT, MRCP, ERCP and EUS showed the cystic lesion and a possibility of an other tumor. There was a stenosis of the main pancreatic duct (MPD) at the pancreas head and dilatation of the MPD from the body to the tail. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of the branch pancreatic duct was diagnosed, and there was a likelihood of ductal carcinoma of the pancreas. We therefore performed pancreatoduodenectomy. Pathological finding showed invasive carcinoma from an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm with invasive ductal carcinoma of the pancreas.
