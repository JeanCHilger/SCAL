A case of an epithelial cyst arising in the intrapancreatic accessory spleen. A 59-year old woman was admitted to our hospital for further examination of a cystic lesion detected in the tail of the pancreas. Imaging studies showed a 35-mm-diameter cystic lesion with septa and mural nodule at the same site. The mural nodule of the cyst was thick and was enhanced. Partial resection of the tail pancreas was performed with a preoperative diagnosis of pancreatic cystic tumor. The resected specimen showed mulitlobular cyst. Histologically, the internal surface of the cyst was covered with stratified squamous cells and the mural nodule of the cyst was spleen tissue. The final diagnosis was an epithelial cyst derived from an accessory spleen in the pancreas.
