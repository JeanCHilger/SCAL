Chest pain caused by pancreatic pseudocyst located in the mediastinum. Mediastinal pancreatic pseudocyst is a rare condition, causing pulmonary, cardiac or oesophageal symptoms. We present a case of a mediastinal pancreatic pseudocyst in a 31-year-old male patient who was admitted on suspicion of having an acute myocardial infarction because of retrosternal pain. Diagnosis was achieved by CT scan, and the pseudocyst was treated by percutanous drainage. The patient recovered well with no further need of intervention.
