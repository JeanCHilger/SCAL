Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration of pancreatic cystic neoplasms: utility and limitations. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration has become an important method for the diagnosis of pancreatic cystic lesions. The collection, endoscopic handling and lab processing of the material must be optimally performed to avoid diagnostic pitfalls. The wide cytological spectrum of cystic pancreatic neoplasms is described especially for the diagnosis of serous cystadenoma and mucinous neoplasms in order to distinguish them from gastrointestinal contaminants. Knowledge of the clinical history, sonographic findings and even the aspirated fluid gross appearance are essential in helping the cytopathologist reach an accurate diagnosis.
