CT features of pancreatic fistula after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Our objective was to establish the CT features that are indicative of pancreatic fistula after pancreaticoduodenectomy.A fluid collection seen on CT around the pancreaticojejunostomy site and in the pancreatic bed may be caused by pancreatic fistula in patients who have undergone pancreaticoduodenectomy. CT depiction of air bubbles in the fluid at these sites may strongly suggest the diagnosis of pancreatic fistula.
