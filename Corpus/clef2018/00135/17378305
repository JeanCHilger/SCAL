A woman with shock as first sign of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. A 49-year-old woman presented at the emergency ward in shock with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Extensive ulceration confirmed by gastroduodenoscopy was suggestive of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Further evaluation by fasting gastrin assessment, CT, endosonography with cytological biopsy and somatostatin-receptor scintigraphy confirmed the diagnosis ofgastrinoma. Three enlarged lymph nodes near the pancreatic head were surgically removed each was found to contain neuroendocrine tumour cells. The patient recovered rapidly after surgery and the gastrin level normalised. Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is uncommon but should be considered as a possible cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Shock is very rarely the first sign ofZollinger-Ellison syndrome. In this case, the use of a proton-pump inhibitor may have masked the disease for years.
