Giant cystadenocarcinoma of pancreatic origin and supra-mesocolic topography. The authors report a case of pancreatic cystadenocarcinoma developed within a few days as a voluminous cyst of the left hypochondriac region, pushing away the organs of the supramesocolic zone. The tumor removal is easily performed because it was surrounded by a fibrotic capsule and their was no precise attach to the neighbouring organs. Diagnosis is carried out by microscopic examination revealing a tubulo-papillary cystadenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Quasi synchronous apparition of disseminated hepatic metastases advocates for heavy malignancy and justifies intrahepatic chemotherapy.
