Symptomatic adult polycystic liver disease in a young woman. Adult polycystic liver disease is an entity that is striking for the presence of extraordinary hepatomegaly. Very rarely do patients under 40 years of age experience problems and only a minority of middle-aged patients manifest symptoms due to organ compression or biliary tree obstruction. The clinical course is usually benign, and no specific therapy is required. The onset of right upper quadrant pain, back pain, and shortness of breath prompted evaluation of a 32-year-old woman with progressive hepatomegaly. CT scan revealed a massive cyst-riddled liver with posterior displacement of the spleen, compression of the pancreas, and renal cysts. Prothrombin time, albumin, and liver enzyme values were normal except for a mildly elevated gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase.
