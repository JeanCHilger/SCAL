Endoscopic ultrasound in gastroenterologic tumors. By means of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) the visualization of the gastrointestinal wall Layers as well as a high-resolution imaging of the pancreas with neighbouring large vessels has become possible. EUS is especially sensitive in the local tumor staging in esophageal, gastric, pancreatic and ampullary carcinoma (accuracy rates 80-90%). Lymph node metastases are correctly identified in 70-80%. This also applies to the rectal cancer employing rigid instruments. Experience with colonic endosonography is still too limited to permit any definitive conclusions. For the primary diagnosis of submucosal tumors of the upper GI tract, and for the detection of small pancreatic lesions (e.g. endocrine tumors), endosonography is of high diagnostic accuracy.
