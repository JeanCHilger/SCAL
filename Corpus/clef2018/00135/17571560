Pancreatic metastases. A case report--solitary pancreatic metastasis from a clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Three years after right nephrectomy for stage II (T2N0) clear cell carcinoma, a 51-year old man presented with upper digestive tract bleeding. Endoscopic examination revealed a duodenal mass. Imaging modalities showed the lesion in the head of the pancreas, with duodenal wall invasion, and raise the question of a pancreatic metastasis. The anatomopathology result of the resection specimen confirms the imaging diagnosis.
