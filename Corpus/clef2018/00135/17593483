Arteriovenous malformation of the pancreas: report of a case. Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) of the pancreas (AVMP) is uncommon and generally asymptomatic therefore, few cases have so far been reported. The symptoms of AVMP include gastrointestinal bleeding, pain, and portal hypertension. Definitive diagnosis is confirmed by angiographic study, and surgery is the only effective treatment. We report a case of AVMP confirmed by computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and angiographic study of the abdomen, in a patient who presented to us with epigastric pain. He underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy, following which his symptoms resolved.
