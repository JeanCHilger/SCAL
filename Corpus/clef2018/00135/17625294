Case of chronic pancreatic brucellosis presenting as hemosuccus pancreaticus. Hemosuccus pancreaticus is an uncommon cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Chronic infection of the pancreas with Brucellosis causing hemosuccus pancreaticus has not been previously reported.We describe a case of a 75-year-old man presenting with a pancreatic mass and hemosuccus pancreaticus secondary to chronic pancreatic brucellosis. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of the pancreatic tissue was positive for brucella after an initial positive serology. ERCP revealed bleeding from the pancreatic duct. Computed tomography scans of the abdomen demonstrated an enlarging pancreatic mass. Endoscopic ultrasound showed a cystic mass in the body of the pancreas. Fine needle aspiration revealed granulomata. Selective mesenteric angiogram failed to reveal the source of bleeding. The patient eventually underwent pancreatic resection with resolution of symptoms.This is the first case of hemosuccus pancreaticus due to chronic pancreatic brucellosis reported in medical literature.
