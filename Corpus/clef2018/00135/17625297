Cerebellar, pancreatic, and paraspinal metastases in soft tissue sarcomas: unusual sites or changing patterns? Soft tissue sarcomas generally first metastasize to the lungs followed by the involvement of other sites such as lymph nodes and bones as part of the disseminated disease. Cerebellar and pancreatic metastases from tumors of mesenchymal origin such as soft tissue sarcomas are exceptional, more so in the absence of pulmonary metastases.A previously treated case of chest wall sarcoma presented with the sudden onset of neurological symptoms. An MRI brain scan was suggestive of a solitary cerebellar metastasis. A CT scan of the thorax and abdomen showed no evidence of disease. A metastasectomy of the solitary brain lesion confirmed a deposit from a previously treated sarcoma. Within two months he presented with central abdominal pain and low backache radiating down both lower limbs. FDG-PET and CT scans revealed a large pancreatic and left paraspinal mass with intense tracer uptake suggestive of metastatic involvement. There was no evidence of pulmonary metastases. A CT-guided biopsy was suggestive of high-grade sarcoma. He was treated with palliative radiotherapy with good symptomatic relief.Cerebellar, pancreatic, and paraspinal metastases from soft tissue sarcomas are rare, especially in the absence of pulmonary metastases. A high index of suspicion is necessary, and appropriate imaging should be considered for symptomatic patients.
