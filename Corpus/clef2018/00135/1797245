Value of imaging procedures in diagnosis of cystic pancreatic tumors. Cystadenoma and cystadenocarcinoma are rare tumors of the pancreas. While these cystic neoplasms neither present any typical clinical symptoms nor cause any specific changes in laboratory parameters, great emphasis is laid on imaging procedures for the diagnosis of these pancreatic tumors. Tumor size, localization and the typical cystic character are well-documented by ultrasound and contrast-enhanced computed tomography. Furthermore, CT could contribute to distinguish between serous and mucinous cystadenoma of the pancreas because of typical features of both tumors. Angiography presents a further suitable diagnostic method, while ERCP findings are rather unspecific and non-homogenous. Furthermore, ultrasound guided fine-needle biopsy should be carried out in unclear cases to confirm the diagnosis.
