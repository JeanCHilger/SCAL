Errors in ultrasonic diagnosis of abdominal diseases. Errors in the ultrasonic diagnosis of diseases of the abdominal organs in 2,218 patients were analysed in comparison to endoscopic and operative findings. The errors were few in number. A precise diagnosis was established in 99.6% of cases with acute cholecystitis and in 78% of those with a pathological process in the biliary tract. A maximum number of errors (7 per 42 cases) was encountered in carcinoma of the gallbladder. Ultrasonic examination may serve as the basis for choosing the method of rational therapy in diseases of the liver, pancreas, and complications in the postoperative period. Thus, the results of ultrasonic examination may be fully relied on or may be used as a basis for choosing manipulations which are more invasive in character.
