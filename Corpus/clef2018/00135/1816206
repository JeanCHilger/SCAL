Malignant insulinoma presenting with recurrent episodic loss of consciousness. A 57 year old male presented with episodic behavioural abnormalities and loss of consciousness for 2 years. His fasting blood glucose was 20 mg/dl and corresponding insulin level 119 uU/ml. His EEG showed intermittent rhythmic delta activity. Abdominal CT scan revealed an enhancing mass in the tail of the pancreas and secondaries in the liver. After distal pancreatectomy, resection of the left lobe of the liver and chemotherapy, the hypoglycaemic spells subsided. Histopathology revealed an islet cell tumour with metastases in the liver. Episodic neurobehavioural dysfunction should alert towards the possibility of hypoglycaemia.
