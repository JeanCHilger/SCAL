Application of endoscopic ultrasound in diagnostics of biliary lithiasis. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and Magnetic Endoscopic Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) are important supplementary methods used for endoscopic extraction of common bile duct stones. The technical characteristics of both methods are excellent. If EUS is used for diagnostic purposes in diagnostic of biliary tree disorders there are almost no adverse consequences compared with other indication for this method. Nevertheless, the results are related to experience of physician. Advance of EUS compared to MRCP is its sensitivity and specificity even in cases where stones are small and dilation of biliary tract is minor. The role of EUS and ERCP in reveal of biliary tree stones and disorders is clearly defined. Comparasion of these two methods should be prospective and used in cases where definitive diagnosis is unclear. If EUS reveal stones in biliary tree then ERCP should be done in same session. Beside its role in excluding biliary pancreatitis, EUS can be used for examination of patient with acute and recurrent pancreatitis and is excellent for revealing ductal and parenchymal abnormalities of pancreas.
