CT-guided core needle biopsy in the diagnosis of pancreatic diseases with an automated biopsy gun. To evaluate the safety and diagnostic accuracy of computed tomographic (CT)-guided core needle biopsy (CNB) in the diagnosis of pancreatic diseases by using an automated biopsy gun with a cutting-type needle.From January 2000 to January 2006, CT-guided CNB was performed in 80 patients suspected of having pancreatic diseases in the absence of liver metastasis. Biopsies were performed with an 18-20-gauge cutting needle driven by a spring-loaded biopsy gun. Histologic reports and medical records of all patients were retrospectively reviewed. An institutional review board exemption was obtained to perform this retrospective study.All patients tolerated the biopsies well, with no serious complications. Three patients had mild abdominal pain after the procedure, and a limited abdominal CT scan did not reveal any marked abnormality. Two patients had an elevated serum amylase level, which returned to normal within 2 weeks. A definitive diagnosis and accurate histologic diagnosis were obtained for 69 patients, for a successful diagnosis rate of 86%. Surgical sampling was performed in 11 patients with neoplasms and nondiagnostic core-needle biopsies. Only 50% of patients with well-differentiated adenocarcinomas were definitely diagnosed with CT-guided CNB.CT-guided CNB with an automated biopsy gun is a safe and effective method for obtaining tissue for the histologic evaluation of pancreatic diseases. However, CT-guided CNB requires further development for the accurate diagnosis of well-differentiated adenocarcinomas.
