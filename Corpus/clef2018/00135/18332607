Case of pancreatic ascites successfully treated with endoscopic pancreatic drainage. We report a 47-year-old man with abdominal distension without other distinct signs. Massive ascites with any singular lesions was revealed on computed tomography, and the ascites was high-amylase and high-protein. on these findings, pancreatic ascites was suspected and he was first treated with conservative therapy, but it failed. Computed tomography one month from the start of therapy demonstrated a pancreatic cyst, and endoscopic retrograde pancreatography revealed transudation of contrast medium from the cyst. A pancreatic duct stent was placed, and the ascites was smoothly eliminated. Endoscopic pancreatic stenting is considerable treatment for pancreatic ascites.
