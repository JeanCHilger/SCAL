Imaging of incidental cystic lesions of the pancreas. Cystic lesions of the pancreas, with an estimated prevalence of 20%, frequently are incidental findings at imaging on asymptomatic patients. Pseudocysts, typically in a setting of pancreatitis, should first be excluded. Characterization of cystic tumors is more complicated. Still, it is important to differentiate between benign and malignant lesions. Multi-detector row CT and MRI allow characterization of such lesions in over 75% of cases. Indeterminate lesions should undergo endoscopic US with biopsy/aspiration and fluid analysis, especially for mucin producing tumors (rounded with thick enhancing wall). When imaging fails to fully characterize a lesion, follow-up may be proposed for lesions less than 3 cm in size, that are either unilocular with thin nonenhancing wall (simple cyst) or lobulated multilocular with thin nonenhancing wall (serous cystadenoma, isolated side branch IPMTP). Follow-up imaging shows that these tumors usually show very little change over time. Management is based on comparing estimated patient survival without treatment to surgical risks (morbidity, mortality, functional sequelae from the procedure).
