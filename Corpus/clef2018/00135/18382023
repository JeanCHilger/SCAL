Splenic laceration after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography has been part of clinical practice for over 35 years. The procedure itself carries risks. Most complications associated with the procedure have been described in the literature. Splenic injury is an extremely rare complication after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and only nine such cases have been reported to our knowledge since 1988. We report on a patient who presented with abdominal pain and was found to have abnormal liver function and a dilated pancreatic duct. An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed and a splenic laceration was noted subsequently. As this operation is an increasingly important diagnostic and therapeutic modality for pancreatico-biliary disease, clinicians must be aware of this complication in order to make an early diagnosis and begin appropriate management.
