Primary hydatid cyst of the pancreas: Diagnosis and surgical procedures. Report of three cases. The pancreas is an uncommon site of a hydatid cyst, even in countries where echinococcal disease is endemic. We report three cases of primary hydatid cysts of the pancreas revealed by abdominal pain. The diagnosis was based on ultrasound and CT-scan, which showed a cystic mass in the tail of the pancreas in the two first cases. In the third case, the diagnosis was determined preoperatively and a pancreatic fistula was found in the head of the pancreas during peroperative cholangiography. The echinococcal immunological test (Elisa) was positive in all cases. Surgical treatment included resection of the prominent lump in two patients and a cystogastric anastomosis in the third. Based on these three cases and a study of the literature, the difficulties of diagnosing this rare disease and the surgical procedures are discussed.
