An insulinoma with clinical and electroencephalographic features resembling complex partial seizures. We described a female patient with insulinoma who experienced recurrent episodes of automatism, confusion and convulsion. Furthermore, her electroencephalography (EEG) findings resembled the pattern in complex partial seizures with secondary generalization. The interictal EEG showed spikes and sharp waves, as well as focal slowing over the left temporal lobe, and the ictal EEG revealed generalized spikes and sharp waves associated with diffused slowing. She was initially misdiagnosed as pharmacoresistant epilepsy. After the insulinoma was found and surgically removed, her EEG turned normal and she was seizure-free during the 4-year follow-up. This report highlights the need for careful reassessment of all seizures refractory to medication, even for the patients associated with epileptiform discharges on EEG.
