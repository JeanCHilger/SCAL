CT and pathological manifestations of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of pancreas: a comparative study. To evaluate the diagnostic value of CT in pancreas intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) by analyzing its CT feature and pathological findings.The clinical and CT data was analyzed among 39 patients with IPMN whose diagnosis was confirmed by pathology. The CT manifestations were classified into 3 types: simple main pancreatic duct enlargement main pancreatic duct enlargement combined with pancreatic cystic lesionThe CT type I matched the main duct type, the CT type II mainly matched the branch type and mixed type, and the CT type III matched the branch type (P < 0.001). The probability of benign lesion was 92% with no mural nodule in the lesion, while the probability of benign lesion was only 42% with mural nodule presented (P = 0.003). In terms of the septa, there was no significant difference between benign and malignant lesions (P = 0.793). The size of malignant/boundary lesions exceeded that of benign lesions (P = 0.016). There were no significant difference in calibers of main pancreatic duct and common bile duct between the benign and malignant/ boundary groups. Without considering pathological grouping the caliber of main pancreatic duct exceeded that of the common bile duct in all the cases (P = 0.02).CT typing of IPMN well matches the pathological typing which benefits the CT diagnosis of IPMN. The caliber of main pancreatic duct usually exceeds that of common bile duct in IPMN. This feature contributes to its diagnosis.
