Transcatheter thrombin embolization of a giant visceral artery aneurysm. A 9.5-cm visceral artery aneurysm was found during a computed tomography (CT) scan performed for abdominal pain. Subsequent selective angiography showed the aneurysm arising from the second branch of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). The celiac trunk was occluded at its origin and blood supply to the splenic artery was provided through the pancreatic-duodenal arcade. Two injections of 5.000 U of thrombin were delivered transcatheter to produce complete thrombosis. No major complications occurred. After 32 months the aneurysm decreased to 3.7 cm in diameter. Transcatheter thrombin injection seems to be a safe and durable option in the treatment of visceral aneurysms.
