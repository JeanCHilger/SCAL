Perfusion imaging of the pancreas using an arterial spin labeling technique. To investigate the feasibility of perfusion imaging of the pancreas using an arterial spin labeling (ASL) technique.An adapted flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR)-TrueFISP ASL technique was implemented on a 1.5 T scanner. Anatomical and perfusion imaging in three different parts of the pancreas were performed in 10 healthy volunteers. Quantitative perfusion values were calculated using the extended Bloch equations.Perfusion images of all subjects showed diagnostic image quality in the pancreatic tail and the head. Assessment of pancreatic tissue perfusion was possible in all organ parts. Mean perfusion values were 271 +/- 79 mL/100g/min in the head, 351 +/- 112 mL/100g/min in the body, and 243 +/- 55 mL/100g/min in the tail of the pancreas. Total examination time for perfusion imaging of the entire organ was 15.4 minutes.FAIR-TrueFISP permits analysis of pancreatic tissue perfusion with good image quality in a clinically applicable measuring time. Assessment of perfusion disorders may be useful in the diagnosis of inflammatory pancreatic pathologies, endocrine and exocrine pancreatic disorders, and in monitoring of pancreatic transplants.
