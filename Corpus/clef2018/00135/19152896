Pancreatic cyst fluid DNA analysis in evaluating pancreatic cysts: a report of the PANDA study. The role of pancreatic cyst fluid DNA analysis in evaluating pancreatic cysts remains unclear.Our purpose was to evaluate the utility of a detailed DNA analysis of pancreatic cyst fluid to diagnose mucinous and malignant cysts.Prospective, multicenter study.Patients with pancreatic cysts presenting for EUS evaluation.EUS-guided pancreatic cyst aspirates cytology evaluation, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level determination, and a detailed DNA analysis incorporating DNA quantification, k-ras mutation and multiple allelic loss analysis, mutational amplitude, and sequence determination.Cyst fluid analysis compared with surgical pathologic or malignant cytologic examination.The study cohort consisted of 113 patients with 40 malignant, 48 premalignant, and 25 benign cysts. Cyst fluid k-ras mutation was helpful in the diagnosis of mucinous cysts (odds ratio 20.9, specificity 96%), whereas receiver-operator characteristic curve analysis indicated optimal cutoff points for allelic loss amplitude (area under the curve [AUC] 0.79 optimal value > 65%) and CEA (AUC 0.74Limited follow-up, selection bias.Elevated amounts of pancreatic cyst fluid DNA, high-amplitude mutations, and specific mutation acquisition sequences are indicators of malignancy. The presence of a k-ras mutation is also indicative of a mucinous cyst. DNA analysis should be considered when cyst cytologic examination is negative for malignancy.
