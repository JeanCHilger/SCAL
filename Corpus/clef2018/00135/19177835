A review of current methods in the diagnostics of morphological changes in chronic pancreatitis. Chronic pancreatitis is a disease with well-defined histopathology, however, the diagnosis is not based on the grading of histological changes, but on the features registered by the methods of morphological and functional diagnostic procedures. The correct diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis is easy in advanced stages, but difficult in early stages of the disease. In this review, we present the current methods used (echosonography, computer tomography, magnetic resonance, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, endoscopic echosonography) in the diagnostics of chronic pancreatitis.
