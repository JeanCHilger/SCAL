Comparison of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, endoscopic ultrasonography, and fecal elastase 1 in chronic pancreatitis and clinical correlation. In this study, we prospectively compared the use of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), and fecal elastase 1 in patients with chronic pancreatitis and searched for correlation with symptoms, clinical findings, and elastase 1 levels.Twenty-four consecutive patients (19 were male, and 5 were female) with chronic pancreatitis who had already undergone ERCP within the last 2 years and 19 healthy control subjects (10 were male, and 9 were female) are studied prospectively. Clinical and laboratory parameters of the patients were recorded, and all underwent EUS and fecal elastase 1 testing. Fecal elastase 1 was measured in healthy control subjects.The ERCP and EUS severity scores were 1 in 0 to 2 patients, 2 in 6 to 8 patients, and 3 in 18 to 14 patients. Sensitivity and specificity of fecal elastase for chronic pancreatitis were 75% and 100%, respectively. There was a negative correlation between disease duration and fecal elastase 1 levels. Patients with dyspepsia or those who use pancreatic enzyme preparations had significantly lower fecal elastase 1 levels than others.Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and EUS are nearly equal in staging chronic pancreatitis. Fecal elastase 1 correlates well with these tests. Fecal elastase 1 also correlates well with some clinical symptoms such as dyspepsia and disease history.
