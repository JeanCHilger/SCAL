Surgical management of bilateral pheochromocytoma. the aim of this retrospective study was to assess our experience in surgical management of bilateral pheochromocytoma (BP) and to report diagnosis methods and therapeutic results of a series of 10 patients treated in "surgical clinique A" department.from 1986 to 2005, we studied all cases of histological confirmed BP in their clinical, biochemical and radiological aspects. We analyzed all of therapeutic attitudes suggested and their results.Ten patients underwent adrenalectomy for BP: 6 men and 4 women with age average of 37.1 (13-60). Eight of them were synchronous BP versus two metachronous ones. Eight patients were symptomatic. One of them had a Von Hippel Lindeau syndrome and 2 others had a familial form of BP. For the two asymptomatic cases: the first one was an incidentaloma and the second one was discovered in a MEN IIb screening. As a primary biochemical diagnostic measure, the determination of the excretion rate of cathecholamine in the 24h urine was high among 6 patients. The ultrasonic imaging and CT scanning were done to localize the tumor site. The surgical treatment consisted in a bilateral adrenalectomy in one phase for 5 patients and in two phases for the 5 others (one double laparoscopy). An enucleating of a pancreatic nodule was an associated act practiced on a patient. Perioperative incidents were related in heart rythme dysfunctions, crises of hypertension among 6 patients and a cardiac arrest rehabilitated. In postoperative phase we assess a death case of sepsis chock, an acute adrenal insufficiency, an acute pancreatitis and a liver metastasis one year after the adrenalectomy. All patients were under hydrocortisone (30 mg) for life.Bilateral adrenalectomy is the basic treatment of a BP. A familial screening must be systematically carried out. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy has good results.
