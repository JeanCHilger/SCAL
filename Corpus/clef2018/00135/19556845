Metachronous four primary malignancies in gastro-intestinal tract. Multiple primary malignancy was reported firstly by Billroth in 1889. Recently, multiple primary malignancies are considered to increase due to improved survival rate of cancer patients, advanced diagnostic tools, and increased use of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In Korea, several cases of triple primary malignancies were reported. However, four primary malignancies in gastro-intestinal tract was rarely reported. Recently, we experienced a 70 year-old male who was diagnosed with metachronous four primary malignancies in rectum, ascending colon, stomach, and ampulla of Vater. We report this rare case of metachronous four primary malignancies with a review of literature.
