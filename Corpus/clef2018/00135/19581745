EUS-guided Trucut biopsies may enable the diagnosis of lymphoepithelial cysts of the pancreas. Report of two cases. Lymphoepithelial cysts are rare benign lesions of the pancreas. Endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) has reportedly been helpful in reaching a diagnosis of lymphoepithelial cyst. In cases where it may be difficult to obtain a diagnosis using FNA a histological sample may be obtained using EUS guided Trucut biopsy.We describe two cases of lymphoepithelial cysts where a diagnosis of lymphoepithelial cyst was made using EUS guided Trucut biopsy.In some case, lymphoepithelial cysts may present a diagnostic dilemma. EUS with FNA and Trucut biopsy may enable the clinician to make a definitive diagnosis.
