Combination of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and computed tomography for preoperative diagnosis of the Mirizzi syndrome. To determine the diagnostic accuracy of combined magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and computed tomography (CT) for preoperative diagnosis of Mirizzi syndrome.Fifty-two patients with surgically proven Mirizzi syndrome (n = 13) and cholecystitis without evidence for Mirizzi syndrome (n = 39) underwent both MRCP using single-shot turbo spin echo and 3-dimensional turbo spin echo sequences and CT. Two blinded observers independently and retrospectively reviewed the combination of MRCP and CT images and CT images alone. Diagnostic accuracy for a combined protocol and CT was evaluated.The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy of the combination of MRCP and CT were 96.0%, 93.5%, 83.5%, 98.5%, and 94.0%, respectively. Corresponding values of CT were 42.0%, 98.5%, 93.0%, 83.5%, and 85.0%, respectively. The sensitivity, negative predictive value, and accuracy of combined protocol were significantly higher than those of CT alone (P = 0.000, 0.001, and 0.042, respectively). Interobserver agreement was better for combined images (kappa = 0.906) than for CT images alone (kappa = 0.812).A combination of MRCP and CT is useful for preoperative diagnosis of Mirizzi syndrome.
