Multidetector CT evaluation of the course of nonresectable pancreatic carcinomas with neoadjuvant therapy. A prospective study to determine the value of multidetector CT (MD-CT) in assessing the course of nonresectable pancreatic carcinoma during therapy.26 patients with nonresectable pancreatic carcinoma underwent MD-CT before and after therapy. The examinations were evaluated with regard to tumor size and vascular invasion using an invasion score (IS) by 2 radiologists independently (kappa analysis). Diagnosis was confirmed surgically, by biopsy or clinical course.Sensitivity for the assessment of irresectability was 100%. Following therapy, 54% of all the tumors were smaller (14/26), 42% had increased in volume (11/26), and one tumor remained stable (1/26). The IS (veins) during follow-up changed in 26 patients (portal vein: 5 higher (mean score 10.4/16.2), 4 lower (mean score 17.5/11.5) superior mesenteric vein: 12 higher (11/14.4), 5 lower (16.2/14.6)MD-CT is suitable for evaluating tumor spread during therapy for nonresectable pancreatic carcinoma. The IS is useful for assessing the degree of change in vessel invasion.
