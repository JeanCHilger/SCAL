A case of nonfunctioning islet cell tumor with extensive calcification. A 52-year-old man was admitted for detailed examination of a mass with extensive calcification in the tail of the pancreas by fluoro-deoxy glucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT). Abdominal CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings showed a calcified tumor 5 cm in diameter with a smooth surface. The tumor mainly showed calcification at it center and a partially solid element around it margin which was enhanced in the early phase. With no definiture preoperative diagnossi, we performed distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy. Pathological and immunohistochemical studies revealed a nonfunctioning islet cell tumor with calcification. A nonfunctioning islet cell tumor with central calcification formation as it grew to a maximum diameter of 7 cm is rare. When diagnosing pancreatic tumors it must be kept in mind that some nonfunctioning islet cell tumors of the pancreas can show nontypical features such as calcification formation.
