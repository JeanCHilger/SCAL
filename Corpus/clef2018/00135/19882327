Acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas with intraductal growth: report of a case. Acinar cell carcinomas (ACCs) of the pancreas are rare neoplasms, accounting for approximately 1% of all exocrine pancreatic tumors. This type of tumor is known to be aggressive, although the survival rates are somewhat better than they are for ductal carcinoma. The tumor tends to present nonspecific symptoms. It occurs in older patients, and jaundice is infrequent. This report presents a case of ACC of the pancreas with intraductal papillary growth and lymph node metastasis.
