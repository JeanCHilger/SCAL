Severe intestinal bleeding due to sinistral portal hypertension after pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy. A rare case of severe intestinal bleeding caused by sinistral portal hypertension after pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy is reported. Examinations revealed that the developed collateral vessels adjacent to the pancreas and elevated jejunum in the right upper abdomen were the source of the intestinal bleeding, and typical gastric varices were not identified. The present case showed atypical development of collateral vessels due to the postoperative state, which made diagnosis difficult.
