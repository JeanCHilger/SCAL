Case report of infected pseudo-aneurysm after intra-arterial chemotherapy. A 63-year-old man admitted to emergency center of our hospital with fever and obstructive jaundice. Computed tomography (CT) showed a mass in the head of the pancreas and a dilated bile duct. After performing preoperative biliary drainage, we conducted pancreatico-duodenectomy (PD-II: T3, N1, stage III). As adjuvant chemotherapy, the patient received a hepatic arterial infusion with 5-FU to prevent liver metastasis. A catheter was placed in the right femoral artery and intra-arterial chemotherapy was carried out for one week. After the completion of chemotherapy, swelling and redness of the right inguinal region was observed. CT revealed an infected pseudo-aneurysm of the femoral artery. Despite intravenous antibiotic therapy for 2 days, bleeding and pus discharge at the catheter root were observed. He immediately underwent drainage and primary suture to stop the bleeding. Two weeks after surgery for the infected pseudo-aneurysm, a right external iliac-femoral bypass operation was performed. Five weeks after surgery, he was discharged without further incident. In such cases, it is advisable to drain the infected pseudo-aneurysm following a prompt diagnosis, and perform a secondary bypass operation.
