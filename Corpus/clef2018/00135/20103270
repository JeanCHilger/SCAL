Pancreatic herniation after transhiatal esophagectomy. Diaphragmatic herniation as a complication after esophagectomy has been described. Contents within the hernia sac have been mainly limited to the small bowel and colon. We believe this is the first case report in the literature of a pancreatic herniation after esophagectomy. The incidence, presentation, technical risk factors, and treatment of post-esophagectomy diaphragmatic hernias are discussed.
