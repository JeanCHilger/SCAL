The role of endoscopic ultrasonography in the evaluation of pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer has a dismal prognosis and complete surgical removal remains the only potential curative treatment. The principle goal of preoperative evaluation is to identify patients with potentially resectable disease while avoiding surgical exploration in those with unresectable disease. There is no evidence-based consensus on the optimal preoperative imaging assessment of patients with suspected pancreatic cancer. Because of its widespread availability, computed tomography (CT) is usually the initial study for this indication, although endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is the most sensitive imaging modality for the detection of pancreatic masses. Due to anatomical limitations, CT and magnetic resonance (MR) are superior to EUS for detection of metastatic disease. EUS is superior to CT and angiography for detection of tumor invasion of the portal vein or confluence. Most studies found no significant differences between EUS, CT and MRI in determination of pancreatic cancer resectability. The optimal place of EUS within the diagnostic algorithm remains dependent on local referral modalities and availability.
