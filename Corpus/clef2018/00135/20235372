Endoscopic ultrasonography elastography in gastroenterology. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) elastography is a new technique for detecting the elastic properties of examined tissues during real time ultrasonography. The method is a very valuable tool for the diagnosis and evaluation of pathologic processes affecting the gastrointestinal tract and its adjacent organs. It represents a major advance in the diagnosis and staging of gastrointestinal malignancies, especially pancreatic carcinoma. EUS also provides guidance for fine needle aspiration (FNA) of undiagnosed masses and lymph nodes. Establishing the diagnosis of Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis is sometimes very difficult. When inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is confined to the colon, there is a lack of diagnostic tools for distinction between Crohn's colitis and ulcerative colitis, which is especially important in definitive phenotyping before surgical decision. Our ongoing studies emphasize the role of EUS elastography in the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease phenotype and primary sclerosing cholangitis. As there are no literature data on this issue, we recommend further investigations in this promising new area of research.
