Pancreatic necrosis. Correlations of traditional radiology of the colon and CT. Pancreatic necrosis is a possible complication of acute pancreatitis. It is characterized by diffuse inflammation associated with exudation or leakage of pancreatic juice with its proteolytic enzymes into the peripancreatic tissues. Colonic complications of acute pancreatitis are uncommon events. The main purpose of our study was to correlate radiological findings of pancreatic necrosis as observed during barium enema to CT patterns. A retrospective study was therefore carried out on 40 patients affected with acute pancreatitis with local and systemic complications. The analysis of the results allowed different patterns to be observed, with the two techniques, in the acute and in the chronic phases. In the acute phase, barium enema of the colon showed inflammatory extrinsic processes involving the wall, with a typical localization related to the spread of pancreatic enzymes along mesenteric pathways, as described by Meyers. CT allowed a thorough evaluation of both the pathologic process and its spatial balance. In the chronic phase, barium enema showed fibrotic strictures and fistulas. CT demonstrated pseudocystic masses and irregular focal areas of decreased attenuation or irregular pancreatic margins. This correlation shows how an extrinsic inflammatory involvement of the colon with a characteristic topography may help make a diagnosis and plan therapy.
