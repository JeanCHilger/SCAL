A benign cystic mass of the pancreas mimicking a malignant lesion. Herein, we highlight the diagnostic challenges of cystic pancreatic tumours, and report a case of chronic pancreatitis caused by a cystic tumour, which consisted in a canal dilatation--and not a pseudocyst. The case thus demonstrates a rare association between a cystic form of chronic pancreatitis and adrenal adenoma. We report the case of a 46-year-old patient with no particular past medical history who presented with long lasting symptoms consisting in an abdominal pain and deterioration in general health. Imaging findings (ultrasound, CT-scan, MRI) showed a 3-cm cystic lesion of the tail of the pancreas associated with a 3-cm adrenal mass. Because of the suspicion of a malignant disease, surgical treatment was performed. Pathological findings consisted in fibrotic chronic pancreatitis with canal dilatation and an adrenal adenoma. Pancreatic cystic lesions are rare tumours. Despite of the multiplicity of imaging techniques, differential techniques lack sensitivity and specificity. Final diagnosis must be based on pathological features.
