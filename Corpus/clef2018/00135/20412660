Primary mesenchymal chondrosarcoma of the pancreas. Extraskeletal chondrosarcomas are rare and there is only one reported case of primary pancreatic chondrosarcoma. We report the case of a 34-year-old woman with a 6-month history of abdominal pain and distention. Radiological studies indicated a mass in the pancreas, and exploratory laparotomy revealed a tumour of the pancreas extending to the hepatic vessels and hepatoduodenal ligament. The mass was completely excised, and the histopathological diagnosis was primary mesenchymal pancreatic chondrosarcoma. Tumour recurred at follow-up 52 months postoperatively.
