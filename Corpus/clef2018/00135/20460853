A case of pancreatic carcinoma presenting as pancreaticopleural fistula with pancreatic pleural effusion. A 63-year-old man was admitted with left pleural effusion, and an amylase level of 30994IU/l. A diagnosis of pancreaticopleural fistula was made, based on the findings of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP). After the placement of an endoscopic naso-pancreatic drainage tube, the pleural effusion markedly reduced. When ERP was performed for internal drainage, the main pancreatic duct and stricture were biopsied and showed pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma histologically. CT revealed a mass in the head of the pancreas. He underwent pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy. To the best of our knowledge this is the first case of pancreatic carcinoma presenting as pancreaticopleural fistula with pancreatic pleural effusion. Clinicians should pay attention to the possible presence of cancer and pancreaticopleural fistula in patients with pancreatic pleural effusion.
