Positive peritoneal lavage cytology is a predictor of worse survival in locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Peritoneal lavage cytology in the staging of pancreatic cancer is not widely used given improvements in computed tomography (CT). The aim of this study was to determine the utility of peritoneal lavage cytology in predicting survival in locally advanced pancreatic cancer.Between 2000 and 2008, 202 patients with biopsy-proven pancreatic cancer who were determined by pancreas protocol CT to be locally advanced and not currently resectable underwent diagnostic laparoscopy and peritoneal lavage for cytology (DL-PLC).DL-PLC upstaged 58 of 202 patients (29%) to stage IV, who had a significantly worse median survival of 11 months versus 16 months (P = .03). Positive cytology was an independent predictor of worse survival (P = .02).Positive peritoneal cytology (stage IV disease) in locally advanced pancreatic cancer is common and predicts worse survival. This survival difference suggests that peritoneal cytology status might be useful in deciding treatment regimens in patients with locally advanced disease based on CT.
