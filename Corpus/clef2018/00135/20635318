Cystic tumors of the pancreas: a radiological perspective. The purpose of this article is to highlight the imaging features of cystic pancreatic tumors. Common cystic pancreatic tumors include serous microcystic adenomas, mucinous cystic tumors, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and solid pseudopapillary tumors. These tumors have characteristic imaging features, especially on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MR cholangiopancreaticography examinations. Imaging findings allow a reasonable differential diagnosis between benign and malignant cystic pancreatic tumors. Thus, accurate imaging characterization of these lesions may lead to accurate patient care and prevent unnecessary surgical interventions.
