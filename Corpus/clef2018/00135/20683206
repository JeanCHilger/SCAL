Role of endoscopic ultrasound for evaluating gastrointestinal tract disorders in pediatrics: a tertiary care center experience. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) with or without fine needle aspiration (FNA) has a well-established role in the evaluation of various gastrointestinal (GI) tract disorders in adults. The clinical impact of EUS on the management of the pediatric population remains less clear. This study evaluates the feasibility, safety, and applications of EUS ± FNA in pediatric GI tract disorders.Using a prospectively maintained EUS database, all patients 18 years of age or younger referred for EUS at our institution were identified. Retrospective chart review was conducted to document procedure indications, type of anesthesia used, EUS findings, final FNA cytology results, and clinical impact of EUS ± FNA on the subsequent management of pediatric patients.Fifty-eight EUS procedures were performed in 56 patients (35 girls). Median age was 16 years (range 4-18 years). The main indications for EUS were acute or recurrent pancreatitis, abdominal pain of suspected pancreatobiliary origin, suspected biliary obstruction, upper GI mucosal/submucosal lesions, and evaluation of pancreatic abnormalities seen on prior imaging. Sedation used included nurse-administered propofol sedation in 38 (73%), general anesthesia in 9 (17%), and fentanyl with meperidine in 3 (6%). Five therapeutic procedures performed included celiac plexus blocks in 4 and 1 EUS-guided pancreatogram. In 44 (86%) patients, EUS provided a new diagnosis. The procedure was successfully completed in all patients with no reported complications.EUS ± FNA is feasible and safe and makes a significant impact on most pediatric patients. Nurse-administered propofol sedation appears to be safe and well tolerated in this group.
