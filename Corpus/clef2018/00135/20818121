Pancreatic actinomycosis as a cause of retroperitoneal fibrosis in a patient with chronic pancreatitis. Case report and literature review. Chronic alcoholic pancreatitis is a debilitating disease that is often complicated by pseudotumoral changes of the pancreas, retroperitoneal fibrosis, and pancreatic cancer. Actinomycosis is an uncommon intra-abdominal infection and its association with chronic pancreatitis has been rarely reported.We present a case of a patient with progressive long standing chronic pancreatitis who develops pseudo-tumoural changes and retroperitoneal fibrosis associated with actinomycosis.This is a rare presentation of actinomycosis, posing a diagnostic challenge to the clinician, with important therapeutic implications.
