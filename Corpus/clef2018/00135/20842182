Focal congenital hyperinsulinism in a patient with septo-optic dysplasia. An infant diagnosed as having hypopituitarism and on adequate hydrocortisone replacement therapy was referred to a tertiary endocrine unit at 5 weeks of age with persistent hypoglycemia that required a high rate of intravenous glucose infusion (up to 18 mg/kg•min⁻¹) to maintain euglycemia.A controlled hypoglycemia screen was performed to measure levels of plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide and 3-β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations. The pancreas was analyzed by fluorine-18-L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine ((18)F-DOPA) PET scan. Genetic analyses were performed on the peripheral blood leukocytes, and loss of heterozygosity within the resected focal lesion of the pancreas was investigated by microsatellite analysis. A glucagon stimulation test helped determine pituitary function, and an MRI of the brain and pituitary gland was performed to define the anatomy of the intracranial structures and the pituitary gland.Focal form of congenital hyperinsulinism localized to the head of the pancreas, septo-optic dysplasia and pituitary hormone deficiencies.Resection of the focal lesion from the head of the pancreas and hormonal replacement therapy for hypopituitarism.
