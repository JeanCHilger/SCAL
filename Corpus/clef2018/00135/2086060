Value of serum CA 19-9 determination in the diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma. In this communication, serum Ca19-9 was determined in a series of patients with benign and malignant GI diseases. It was found that CA19-9 was positive in 86.7% of 30 pancreatic cancer patients with an average level of 427.53 u/ml, the value was statistically different from that found in non-malignant control group. Serum CA19-9 determination, in this series, helped to make definite diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in 6 cases, in which B-mode ultrasonography failed to diagnose, and in another 3 cases in which CT scanning was unable to 'see' the tumors. The combination of CA19-9, B-mode ultrasonography, and CT made definite diagnosis in 100% of all 30 pancreatic cancer patients. The authors discussed the significance of CA19-9 determination in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.
