Tumor of the esophoagocardiac junction. The presence of heterotopic pancreatic tissue in the gastroesophageal junction is a very rare entity. An exact preoperative diagnosis is only rarely possible despite all available diagnostic procedures. We report on the case of a submucous tumor of the gastroesophageal junction which became symptomatic due to reflux problems and was successfully removed by endoscope-assisted laparoscopic resection.
