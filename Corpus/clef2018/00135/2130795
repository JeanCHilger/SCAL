Selective resection of the distal bile duct in a high risk patient with polypoid cancer of the intrapancreatic bile duct. An 81-year-old man who had suffered from hypertension for the preceding three years was admitted as an emergency to the department of neurology of our hospital with the chief complaint of dysarthria. He was diagnosed to have multiple lacunar cerebral infarcts by cranial CT, while the laboratory data showed liver dysfunction characteristic of cholestasis. Mild respiratory insufficiency and renal dysfunction were also found. Further radiological examinations on the liver and biliary tree (US, CT and ERC) were performed, and they revealed that the common bile duct was dilated due to two stone-like masses. He was referred to our department of surgery and underwent laparotomy. Intraoperative endoscopy disclosed intraductal papillomatous lesions. Because of the multiple complications of the patient, resection of the entire common bile duct including the gallbladder and the papilla of Vater without any resection of the pancreas was performed instead of pancreatoduodenectomy. The postoperative course was uneventful and he was discharged on the 31st POD. One year after operation, there is no sign of recurrence either clinically or radiologically. The potentially curative operation for cancer of the distal bile duct is pancreatoduodenectomy, but this is of so great a surgical stress that such a high risk case as described above might be unable to survive it. Even if he survived the perioperative period, he might have a poor quality of life due to postoperative complications. The macroscopic appearance of bile duct cancer is correlated to its invasive spread and prognosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
