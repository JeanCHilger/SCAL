ATP assay-guided chemosensitivity testing for gemcitabine with biopsy specimens obtained from unresectable pancreatic cancer using endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration. This study evaluates the feasibility of chemosensitivity testing by use of endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) samples and determines the optimum cut-off value for gemcitabine.Thirty-four consecutive patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer were enrolled. Chemosensitivity (treated/control ratio: T/C ratio) was calculated as the quantity of adenosine triphosphate for a tumor treated with gemcitabine as a percentage of that for the control. To identify the cut-off value sufficient to predict 180 days of progression-free survival (PFS), the receiver operating characteristic curve and the corresponding area under the curve (AUC) were calculated.The success of this assay was 88.2% (30/34) therefore, 30 patients were assessable and included in the population of analyzable patients.. The response was 6.7%. Median PFS was 96 days and median overall survival was 241 days, respectively. The cut-off value was determined as 74% (AUC, 0.745Chemosensitivity testing by use of EUS-FNA samples in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer is feasible. This definition emphasizes the possibility of selecting patients for whom favorable results from gemcitabine treatment can be expected.
