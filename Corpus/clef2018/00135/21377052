Contrast behavior of high-spatial-resolution T1-weighted MR imaging at 3.0 T vs. 1.5 T. Twenty-four volunteers were examined at T1-weighted images with thin sections using gradient-based sequences with a possible short and same TR at 3.0 and 1.5 T. Pancreas-to-spleen contrast measurements and scores for visual assessments of image contrast were significantly worse at 3.0 T than at 1.5 T on both sequences. The image contrast of high-spatial-resolution T1-weighted images at 3.0 T is decreased compared to that of images with the same and possible short TR at 1.5 T.
