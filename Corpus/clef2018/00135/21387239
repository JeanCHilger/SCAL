Malignant intraductal papillary mucinous tumours of the pancreas. A three cases report. Intra ductal papillary mucinous tumors of pancreas are rare and are characterized by a risk of malignant transformation.To clarify their clinical presentation and the performance of different imaging examinations to determine their benign or malignant and achieve their staging.We report three cases of degenerate intra ductal papillary mucinous tumors of pancreas. The combination of CT, the pancreato- MRI and duodenoscopy has led to the diagnosis in all cases. A pancreaticoduodenectomy were performed in two cases.The various imaging techniques allow better detection and analysis of the tumor including the evaluation criteria of degeneration. The treatment of these lesions is still surgery.
