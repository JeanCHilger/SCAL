Infarction of lesser omental fat mimicking an exophytic pancreatic tumor by sonography. We report a case of infarction of lesser omental fat in a 30-year-old woman who presented with epigastric pain. Sonography revealed a painful echogenic mass in the epigastrium that could not be separated from the adjacent hyperechoic pancreas and mimicked an exophytic pancreatic tumor. On CT, the mass was identified as an inflammatory lipomatous mass in the lesser sac, leading to the diagnosis of infarction of lesser omental fat. The patient was successfully treated conservatively.
