Local recurrence of pancreatic cancer after primary surgical intervention: how to deal with this devastating scenario? The dismal prognosis of pancreatic cancer reflects into the increased recurrence rate, even after R0 pancreaticoduodenectomy. Although, conventional radiation-, chemo- or surgical therapy in much selected cases, seem to work out favorably long term, less invasive and non-toxic methods with more immediate results are always preferred, concerning the already aggravated status of this group of patients. We present hereby a comprehensive review of the literature concerning the treatment of recurrent pancreatic cancer based on the case of a patient who 20 months after a pancreaticoduodenectomy developed portal hypertension and symptomatic first degree esophageal, gastric and mesenteric varices, caused by the nearly complete splenic vein obstruction at the portal vein confluence. The varices were revascularized by a percutaneous transhepatic placement of an endovascular stent into the splenic vein, along with a sequent stereotactic body radiation therapy for the local tumor control. Thanks to the accuracy and safety of the present combined treatment, the patient one year later presents control of the disease and its complications. Our paper is the first in the international literature that tries to review all the treatment modalities available (surgical, adjuvant, neoadjuvant and palliative therapy) and their efficacy, concerning the locally recurrent pancreatic cancer furthermore, we tried to analyze the application of the above mentioned combined therapeutic approach in similar cases, elucidating simultaneously all the questions that arise. The limited existing data in the international literature and the lack of randomized controlled trials make this effort difficult, but the physician should be aware after all of all the available and innovative treatment modalities, before he chooses one. Finally, we would like to emphasize the fact that not only the local control but also the management of the complications are important for a prolonged median survival and a better quality of life after all.
