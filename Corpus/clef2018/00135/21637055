Whole-body gallium-67 scintigraphic findings in IgG4-related disease. To clarify the features of gallium-67 (Ga-67) imaging typical of IgG4-related disease.We retrospectively investigated 14 patients diagnosed with IgG4-related disease who underwent Ga-67 scintigraphy in our hospital between January 2005 and May 2010. Of these, 13 patients who underwent gallium scintigraphy before steroid therapy were enrolled in this study. The patient population comprised 11 men and 2 women with age ranging from 47 to 76 years (mean age, 61.9 years).Among the 13 patients, significant accumulation of Ga-67 was detected in the bilateral pulmonary hila in 10 patients (77%), pancreas in 10 (77%), salivary glands in 7 (54%), lacrimal glands in 7 (54%), periaortic lesions in 2 (15%), and lung parenchyma in 1 (8%) patient. High accumulation of Ga-67 in the salivary glands was observed in the parotid glands in 3 cases and in the submandibular glands in 6 cases, with the following pattern: normal parotid gland uptake and symmetrical submandibular gland uptake in 2 cases symmetrical high accumulation in both parotid and submandibular glands in 1 caseCharacteristic patterns of gallium uptake would be helpful for diagnosis, detection of involved lesions, and differential diagnosis in patients with IgG4-related disease to avoid unnecessary surgery.
