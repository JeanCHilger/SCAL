The role of endoscopic ultrasound and cyst fluid analysis in the initial evaluation and follow-up of incidental pancreatic cystic lesions. To assess the role of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in the initial evaluation and follow-up of incidental pancreatic cystic lesions (PCL).Retrospective analysis of patients with incidental PCL on imaging who were evaluated by EUS and had a minimal follow-up of 1 year.There were 62 patients (40 females and 22 males). The mean patient age was 67.7 years (range, 30-89). The Median follow-up was 24 months (range, 12-72). The mean PCL size was 21.6 mm. In all, 13 patients underwent surgery (20.9%). Diagnosis included a mucinous cystic tumour (7), mucinous adenocarcinoma (2), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (1) and a cystic neuroendocrine tumour (1). The overall malignancy rate among patients who underwent surgery was 15.3% (two patients). The mean carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level from PCL fluid analysis was also significantly higher in surgically treated group (7760) vs. the stable group (184.7) vs. the enlarging PCL group (361.1). A CEA level above 192 ng/ml predicted mucinous PCL with a sensitivity of 90%.EUS with cystic fluid analysis can be successfully used to rule out pancreatic neoplasms and to follow-up incidentally discovered PCL.
