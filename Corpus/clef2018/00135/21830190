Fine needle aspiration using forward-viewing endoscopic ultrasonography. A prototype forward-viewing instrument has been developed for therapeutic endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA). We had the opportunity to use this forward-viewing echo endoscope and to study its clinical usefulness, mainly for diagnostic EUS-FNA.The prototype forward-viewing echo endoscope was used for 15 months between November 2006 and March 2010, in a study group comprising 47 consecutive patients. Diagnostic EUS-FNA was done in 38 patients and the diagnostic accuracy of the forward-viewing device was compared with that from an oblique-viewing echo endoscope in reference patients who were matched by disease and puncture route. Therapeutic EUS was done in nine patients (pseudocyst drainage in six celiac ganglia neurolysis, biliary drainage, and pancreatic duct drainage in one each).Diagnostic EUS-FNA provided a correct diagnosis in 97.4 % (37/38 patients), which was not significantly different from the 94.7 % (36/38) in the reference patients. Lesions considered difficult to access with an oblique-viewing scope, such as those located at the fornix, or the head of the pancreas, or associated with strictures, were easily punctured, as were those located at the body or tail of the pancreas or at the porta hepatis. Treatment was successful in all nine patients who underwent therapeutic EUS procedures. None of the 47 patients had any complications.A forward-viewing echo endoscope that allows target sites to be punctured more perpendicularly with minimal effort, can be used for diagnostic EUS-FNA and this may be advantageous, depending on the site of target lesions.
