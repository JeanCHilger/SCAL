Chronic calcific pancreatitis presenting as an isolated left perinephric abscess: a case report and review of the literature. Acute and chronic pancreatitis may present with pseudocysts in atypical locations. Activated pancreatic enzymes track along anatomic fascial planes causing digestion of the surrounding tissues and resulting in distant pseudocysts. Pseudocysts at atypical locations pose significant diagnostic as well as therapeutic challenges.We report an unusual presentation of a pancreatic pseudocyst in a young male who presented with a left perinephric abscess. Percutaneous drainage was not successful in resolving the abscess and he was subsequently diagnosed as having chronic pancreatitis together with a left perinephric abscess. Needle knife sphincterotomy of the ampulla of Vater resulted in the gradual resolution of the abscess.We report a rare presentation of chronic pancreatitis with a perinephric abscess and its non-surgical management. This case report indicates that any patient presenting with a perinephric abscess of unknown etiology not responding to conventional treatment modalities should be investigated for underlying pancreatitis.
