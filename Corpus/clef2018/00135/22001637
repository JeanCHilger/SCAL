Classification of the celiac axis stenosis owing to median arcuate ligament compression, based on severity of the stenosis with subsequent proposals for management during pancreatoduodenectomy. After pancreatoduodenectomy in patients with celiac axis stenosis or obstruction, it becomes problematic to maintain the upper abdominal organ blood flow, especially to the liver. The aim of this study was to investigate the celiac axis stenosis caused by median arcuate ligament (MAL) compression and to classify it according to preoperative image findings.From January 1989 to November 2010, 562 patients underwent operations for diseases of the pancreatic head region in our department. To diagnose celiac artery compression by the MAL, angiography was used in the early period and 3-dimensional image reconstruction of multidetector-row computed tomography was used from 2004. The morphologic characteristics of the celiac axis stenosis were analyzed during intraoperative treatment.Twelve (2.1%) patients were diagnosed with MAL compression, and 8 of these patients only underwent MAL division to restore the celiac artery blood flow. One patient required conservation of the collateral circulation, and 2 patients needed arterial reconstruction. In the analysis of the level of origin of the celiac axis, there were no remarkable differences between nonstenotic and stenotic cases, or between mild and severe stenotic cases. Morphologic grades were defined based on the preoperative image findings and consequent intraoperative treatments.Preoperative grading of celiac axis stenosis could make pancreatoduodenectomy safer with maintenance of the upper abdominal organ blood flow in patients with MAL compression.
