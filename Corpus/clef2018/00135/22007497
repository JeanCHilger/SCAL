One-stop examination of thoracic and abdominal injuries in earthquake victims using multi-slice CT. To assess the clinical value of multi-slice CT in one-stop examination of thoracic and abdominal injuries in earthquake victims.DR and multi-slice CT examination were performed in 162 earthquake victims with thoracic and abdominal injuries. Optimal processes and preferred modalities were identified through comparisons of examination time, radiation dose and diagnostic value between the two methods.The multi-slice CT took (5 +/- 2) min, shorter than that of DR (10 +/- 3) min (P < 0.001). The radiation dose of multi-slice CT (6.4 +/- 1.7) mSv was higher than that of DR (2.4 +/- 1.3) mSv (P < 0.001). Both methods were able to detect bone fracture (clavicle, rib, sternum, thoracic spine, lumbar and pelvic). However, soft-tissue organ trauma, such as liver, pancreas and spleen could not be detected by DR. Multi-slice CT had significantly higher sensitivity (98%) and specificity (97%) in detecting thoracic and abdominal injuries than DR (74%, 67%).Multi-slice CT one-stop examination is a preferred method for detecting combined injuries in emergency events, as it can save examination time and obtain reliable diagnostic information.
