Congenital brachioesophagus with secondary intrathoracic stomach associated with rachischisis described as "serpentine-like syndrome": a case report and literature review. We report a male infant with severe brachioesophagus with intrathoracic stomach, duodenum, pancreas, and spleen associated with short neck because of rachischisis and scoliosis, an extremely rare condition described recently as "serpentine-like syndrome". Our case died and we review four similar cases reported in the English literature.
