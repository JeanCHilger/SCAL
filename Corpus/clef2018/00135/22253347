Pancreatic endocrine neoplasms: a current update on genetics and imaging. Pancreatic endocrine neoplasms are rare pancreatic tumours that may occur sporadically or as part of inherited syndromes such as multiple endocrine neoplasia-1 syndrome, von Recklinghausen disease, von Hippel-Lindau syndrome and tuberous sclerosis complex. Recent advances in the genetics and pathology of hereditary syndromes have provided valuable insights into the pathophysiology and biology of sporadic pancreatic endocrine neoplasms. Evolving molecular data on the biology of these neoplasms have the potential for diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic use.
