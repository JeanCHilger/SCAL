Serous cystadenoma of the pancreas: radiologic and clinicopathologic features in seven cases. Clinical charts, radiologic features, macroscopic and microscopic findings, and clinical follow-up data in seven patients with serous cystadenoma of the pancreas (SCAP) were retrospectively reviewed. The seven patients with SCAP consisted of six women and one man, and their ages ranged from 52 to 76 years with a mean age of 64.9. The most common symptoms were abdominal mass or pain. The greatest diameter of the seven tumors ranged from 2cm to 10cm with a mean diameter of 6.6cm. On ultrasonograms and/or computed tomograms, the tumors were visualized as lobulated masses containing numerous small cysts. Three tumors angiographically examined were all characteristic hypervascular masses with neovascularity. Macroscopically, the tumors were well-defined lobulated masses containing many cysts with a central scar. Microscopically the cysts were lined with a layer of cuboidal epithelium with centrally placed round nuclei and clear cytoplasms containing abundant glycogen. One patient had undergone a cystojejunostomy five years before the complete resection and the tumor increased in size necessitating a pancreatoduodenectomy. The seven patients with SCAP were doing well without any signs of local recurrence or distant metastasis during the period from 2 months to 120 months after a complete resection. Despite its enormous size at the time of diagnosis, SCAP should be resected with aggressive intent because the complete resection produces a favorable clinical course.
