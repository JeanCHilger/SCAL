Correlation between spiral CT preoperative staging of pancreatic cancer and PTEN and COX-2 expression. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of TNM staging of pancreatic cancer by multilayer spiral computed tomography (MSCT) and its correlation with tissue PTEN and COX-2 expression.Fifty-two patients with pancreatic cancer had MSCT for TNM staging and PTEN and COX-2 expression were detected in pancreatic cancer tissue by immunohistochemistry.The total accuracy of MSCT was 79.5% in diagnosis of TMN staging of pancreatic cancer, with 73.1% for T staging (70.0% in T1, 65.0% in T2, 82.4% in T3 and 80.0% in T4), 76.9% for N staging (81.8% in N0 and 73.3% in N1) and 88.5% for M staging (89.7% in M0 and 84.6% in M1). The PTEN expression was not related to tumor size (p>0.05) but correlated with T staging, lymph node metastasis and clinical staging (p<0.05). COX-2 expression was not related to tumor size and T staging (p>0.05) but correlated with lymph node metastasis and clinical staging (p<0.05).TNM staging of pancreatic cancer was accurately conducted by MSCT-thin-layer-imaging. The correlation with PTEN and COX-2 expression implied that combined application of both approaches can improve the accuracy of diagnosis and staging in pancreatic cancer.
