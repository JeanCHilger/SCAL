Laboratory and instrumental diagnostics of pancreatic diseases. The review focuses on the potential of modern laboratory and instrumental diagnostics ofpancreatic diseases including various forms of chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, cysts and pseudocysts, calcificators and concrements, abscesses, neuroendocrine tumours, etc. Diagnostic criteria for exocrine pancreatic disorders, such as hyper- and hyposecretory (hyper- and hypoenzymatic) forms of chronic pancreatitis are described along with direct and indirect, invasive and non-invasive, probe-based and probe-free methods for their study. Special attention is given to instrumental visualization of structural and morphological changes in the pancreas under different pathological conditions. The description of methods for the study of pancreatic endocrine functions and diagnostics of pancreatic diseases is preceded by a brief anatomo-physiologic essay.
