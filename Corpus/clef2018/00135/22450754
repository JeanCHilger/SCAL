Preoperative pancreas CT/MRI characteristics predict fistula rate after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Pancreatic fistula (PF) is considered to be the main cause of morbidity after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). A recent study from our institution suggested the risk for pancreatic fistula after distal pancreatectomy to be closely related to the pancreatic remnant volume (PRV). The hypothesis was formulated that after PD the PRV is an important determinant of the risk for PF formation.All patients undergoing PD between September 2007 and November 2010 at the Karolinska University Hospital Stockholm were included. Preoperative multidetector computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to calculate the PRV and the pancreatic duct width (PDW) at the alleged resection line.A total of 182 patients (median age 67 years) undergoing PD were included. The diagnosis was malignant in 144 patients (79.1 %) and benign in 38 (20.9 %). Pancreatic fistula defined according to the International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula (ISGPF) criteria was diagnosed in 37 patients (20.3 %). The median PRV was 35.2 cm(3) and the median PDW was 3.9 mm. In a univariate analysis a large calculated volume of the pancreatic remnant increased the subsequent risk of PF (odds ratio [OR], 3.71 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.58-8.71A large pancreatic volume and small pancreatic duct increase the risk of PF. Preoperative CT and/or MRI therefore are useful in predicting fistula formation before pancreaticoduodenectomy.
