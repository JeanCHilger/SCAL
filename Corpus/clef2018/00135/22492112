Endovascular management of vascular complications in pancreatic transplants. Vascular complications after pancreatic transplantation carry a high rate of graft loss. Endovascular management of these complications is confined to stent placement for iliac artery inflow disease and embolization for arteriovenous fistulae (AVFs), pseudoaneurysms, or active bleeding. The current study describes the endovascular management of pancreatic transplant venous thrombosis (N = 1), arterial stenosis (N = 5), thrombosis (N = 3), pseudoaneurysms (N = 1), and AVF (N = 2). In addition, embolization of nonfunctioning grafts is described as an endovascular alternative to pancreatectomy.
