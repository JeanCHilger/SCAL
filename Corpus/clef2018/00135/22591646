Diagnostic role of endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine needle aspiration of gallbladder lesions. Endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is a well-established diagnostic technique for examining various organs of the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas, but little is known about its use in the diagnostic work-up of GB lesions. The objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate the efficacy of EUS-FNA of GB lesions.Twenty-eight patients who underwent EUS-FNA for evaluation of GB lesions were enrolled. The pathological results and complications were assessed.EUS-FNA of GB was performed in 13 patients and that of enlarged lymph nodes was done in 18. Of the 13 GB lesions sampled by EUS-FNA, 10 were diagnosed as malignant and 3 were negative for malignant cells. Of the latter 3, two were false negatives for malignancy. All 14 metastatic lymphadenopathy cases were diagnosed with EUS-FNA of lymph nodes. EUS-FNA could differentiate adenocarcinomas and other malignant diseases. Cholecystitis occurred in one patient after EUS-FNA of the GB.EUS-FNA is a feasible, safe and reliable method for obtaining samples from GB lesions. EUS-FNA of lymph nodes is complementary to EUS-FNA of the GB and provides nodal stage as well as histological diagnosis.
