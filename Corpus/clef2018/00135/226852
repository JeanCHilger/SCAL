Computerized tomographic localization of insulinomas (author's transl). Computerized  tomographic localization of insulinomas utilises the differences in radiodensity between the tumor and the adjacent pancreatic tissue. With the aid of this new technique four insulinomas have been localized preoperatively. All of the tumors had the same radiodensity. Firm, well encapsulated beta-islet-cell tumors were detected with the same ease as an insulinoma, which was soft and almost without encapsulation. The smallest tumor detected was 1.0 cm in diameter. Of the four insulinomas, localized by computer tomography of the body, only one was also detected angiographically and only two were detected sonographically.
