Incidental pancreatic cysts found by magnetic resonance imaging and their relationship with pancreatic cancer. We examined whether the presence of pancreatic cysts could be a risk for pancreatic cancer by comparing the incidence and characteristics of cysts found by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in patients with and without pancreatic cancer.Half-Fourier rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement images and MR cholangiopancreatography were performed in 116 patients with pancreatic cancer (PC group) and 1226 with nonpancreatic disease (NP group). Incidence and characteristics of cysts were analyzed.Pancreatic cysts were detected in 65 patients (56%) of the PC group and in 123 patients (10%) of the NP group. According to the multivariate analysis, cyst presence was a significant risk factor for pancreatic cancer (odds ratio [OR], 10.27 P < 0.01), especially cysts larger than 10 mm (OR, 4.718Patients with pancreatic cysts, especially larger than 10 mm, were considered to be at an increased risk of pancreatic cancer over the entire pancreas.
