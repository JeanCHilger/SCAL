Diagnosis, follow-up, and treatment policy making in patients with acute pancreatitis (CT and MRI evidence). The paper deals with the use of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis, followup, and treatment policy making in patients with severe acute severe pancreatitis with manifestations as pancreatic necrosis, fluid collections (exudate accumulations in peripancreatic and retroperitoneal spaces), as well as that complicated by infection, abscess, and pseudocysts. The results of examining 502 patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) with different complications, who had been treated at the S.P. Botkin City Clinical Hospital in 2007 to 2010, were used to analyze the data of the study, to detail tactics in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with AP, by using bolus contrast-enhanced CT in combination with MRI, which allows one to reveal the nature and severity of the disease with a high accuracy, to make its prognosis, and to determine the effective procedure of treatment. Substantiation of the imperfection of the 1992 Atlanta classification and its specifying Balthazar classification figures high in the paper.
