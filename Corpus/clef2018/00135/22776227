Laparoscopic-assisted management of severe necrotizing pancreatitis with obstructive jaundice: a case report. We report a severely infected necrotizing pancreatitis managed with hand-assisted laparoscopic necrosectomy along with a review of the relevant literature. Minimally invasive necrosectomy has been shown to be efficient and advantageous in managing necrotizing pancreatitis. Multiple techniques have been advocated over the last decade. Laparoscopic pancreatic debridement is a feasible option for some patients with necrotizing pancreatitis. We selected hand-assisted laparoscopic pancreatic necrosectomy, which has gained some favor over open necrosectomy because of the morbidity and mortality associated with laparotomy. We report on an Indian male patient who presented with acute abdomen and severe jaundice. A CT scan of the abdomen showed severe necrotizing pancreatitis. After conservative management failed, a hand-assisted laparoscopic pancreatic necrosectomy was performed. The patient recovered and was discharged 4 weeks after surgery.
