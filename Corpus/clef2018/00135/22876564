Persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy. Congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) is the most frequent cause of severe, persistent hypoglycemia in infancy and childhood. We report a case of CHI with diffuse pancreatic abnormality diagnosed preoperatively using the 68Ga octreotide (DOTA NOC) positron emission tomography scan. Genetic analysis revealed homozygous ABCC8 splicing mutation. Subtotal (95%) pancreatectomy was done, and the infant remained euglycemic and was discharged on breast feeds. The patient is continuously followed up and is asymptomatic until 9 months.
