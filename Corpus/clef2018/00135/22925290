Factors affecting the diagnostic accuracy of endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) for upper gastrointestinal submucosal or extraluminal solid mass lesions. A number of potential variables are associated with the diagnostic accuracy of endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA). The aim of this study was to evaluate factors affecting the diagnostic accuracy of EUS-FNA for upper gastrointestinal submucosal or extraluminal solid lesions.Patients with such lesions who underwent EUS-FNA between January 2009 and December 2010 were studied retrospectively. Needles of 22, 25 and 19 gauge were used. The associations between the EUS-FNA results and factors such as mass location, mass size, needle size, number of needle passes, combined histologic-cytologic analysis and final diagnosis were analyzed.A total of 170 EUS-FNA procedures were performed in 158 patients with upper gastrointestinal submucosal or extraluminal solid lesions. The overall accuracy of EUS-FNA was 86.5% (147/170). The diagnostic accuracy with three or more needle passes was higher than with less than 3.0 needle passes (90.0%, 108/120 vs 78.0%, 39/50 P < 0.05). Mass location, mass size, and final diagnosis were not associated with EUS-FNA accuracy. Combined cytologic-histologic analysis had significantly higher diagnostic accuracy than either cytologic or histologic analysis alone (P < 0.001). In a subgroup of 90 patients, both 22 and 25 gauge needles were used for EUS-FNA. The overall diagnostic accuracy was similar for 25 gauge needles and 22 gauge needles (80.0% vs 78.9% P = 1.000) in this subgroup.Overall, 25 and 22 gauge needles have a similar diagnostic accuracy. Our results suggest that 3.0 or more needle passes and combined cytologic-histologic analysis enhance the diagnostic accuracy of EUS-FNA.
