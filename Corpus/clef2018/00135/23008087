Foamy gland pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma diagnosed on EUS-FNA: a histochemical, immunohistochemical, and molecular report. The foamy gland pattern (FGP) may impart to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) a deceptively benign appearance. Thus, its diagnosis on FNA is challenging. A case of PDA with FGP, that was suspected on Diff Quik smears, diagnosed on cell-block preparation and confirmed by ancillary stains and molecular techniques, is here reported. The diagnostic interpretation of foamy atypical cells on direct smears may benefit from cell block preparation and from ancillary techniques.
