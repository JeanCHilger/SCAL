The clinical value of scintigraphy of neuroendocrine tumors using (99m)Tc-HYNIC-TOC. To assess the value of whole body scintigraphy using (99m)Tc-HYNIC-TOC (Tektrotyd) and with single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) in the detection of primary and metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs).Thirty patients with different neuroendocrine tumors, mainly gastroenteropancreatic (GEP), were investigated. Whole body scintigraphy was performed 2 h (if necessary 10 min and 24h) after i.v. administration of 740 Mbq (99m)Tc-Tektrotyd, Polatom. In cases of unclear findings obtained by whole body scintigraphy, investigation was followed by SPECT.From 12 patients with NETs of unknown origin, there were 10 true positive (TP), and 2 false negative (FN) findings. Diagnosis was made with SPECT in 6 patients. From 8 patients with gut carcinoids, there were 4 TP, 2 true negative (TN), one FN, and one false positive (FP) finding. Diagnosis was made with SPECT in 2 patients. From 7 patients with neuroendocrine pancreatic carcinomas there were 4 TP and 3 TN findings. Diagnosis was made with SPECT in 2 patients. From 3 patients with gastrinomas there were 2 TP findings and one TN findings. Diagnosis was made with SPECT findings in 2 patients. Sensitivity of (99m)Tc-HYNIC-TOC was 87%, specificity 86%, positive predictive value 95%, negative predictive value 67% and accuracy 87%.We concluded that scintigraphy with (99m)Tc-Tektrotyd is an useful method for diagnosis, staging and follow up of the patients with NETs.
