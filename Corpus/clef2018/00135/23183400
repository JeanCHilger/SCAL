EUS-FNA diagnosis of a pancreatic lymphoepithelial cyst: three-year imaging follow-up. Lymphoepithelial cyst of the pancreas is a rare benign lesion that should be managed conservatively. Similarity has been described between lymphoepithelial cyst and a branchial cyst of the neck.We report a 58-year-old man presenting with left sided abdominal pain initially thought to be renal colic. CT of the abdomen revealed a 3.5 cm lesion in the pancreatic tail. A laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy was initially planned for definitive treatment however, endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) was performed prior to surgery as he had multiple co-morbidities. This confirmed the diagnosis of lymphoepithelial cyst, a benign lesion. Unnecessary high-risk surgery was therefore avoided. Three year follow-up has shown no adverse effects and the lymphoepithelial cyst is unchanged in size and appearance.EUS-FNA is a reliable method to confidently diagnose lymphoepithelial cyst and therefore should be used to exclude malignancy, thus avoiding unnecessary surgery with potential complications.
