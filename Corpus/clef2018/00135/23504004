Two-stage operation for synchronous triple primary cancer of the esophagus, stomach, and ampulla of Vater: report of a case. A 69-year-old man with jaundice was diagnosed with cancer of the ampulla of Vater by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and abdominal computed tomography. A screening gastrointestinal endoscopy showed middle thoracic esophageal cancer and early gastric cancer on the anterior wall of the lower gastric body. We chose a two-stage operation for synchronous triple primary cancer of the esophagus, stomach, and ampulla of Vater, in order to safely perform the curative resection of these three cancers. The first-stage operation consisted of a right transthoracic subtotal esophagectomy with mediastinal and cervical lymph node dissection, an external esophagostomy in the neck, and a gastrostomy. Thirty-five days after the first surgery, a total gastrectomy with regional lymph node dissection, and a pancreatoduodenectomy with Child's reconstruction were performed as the second-stage surgery. Esophageal reconstruction was achieved using the ileocolon via the percutaneous route without vascular anastomosis.
