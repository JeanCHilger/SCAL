Multifocal lesions with pancreatic atrophy in IgG4-related autoimmune pancreatitis: report of a case. We herein report a case of IgG4-related autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP). A 72-year-old male with jaundice visited our hospital complaining of epigastralgia. A blood chemistry analysis revealed elevated serum levels of total bilirubin and DUPAN-II. Computed tomography (CT) revealed irregularly shaped pancreatic masses with a stricture of the main pancreatic duct (MPD) in the head and tail that were interposed by marked atrophy with MPD dilation in the body. F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography/CT revealed abnormally intense FDG uptake only at the masses. During surgery, another small tumor was also found in the atrophied body therefore, a total pancreatectomy was performed under the diagnosis of multiple pancreatic cancers. The histological analysis revealed fibrosis with dense and diffuse infiltrations of lymphocytes and IgG4-positive plasma cells. The pancreatic parenchyma of the body was firmly replaced by fibrosis. AIP can lead to the formation of multiple pancreatic lesions, and thus the correct diagnosis is occasionally difficult to establish in atypical cases.
