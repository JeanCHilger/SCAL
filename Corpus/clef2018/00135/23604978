Blunt pancreatic trauma: evaluation with MDCT technology. The purpose of this paper is to determine the relative frequency of multi-detector CT (MDCT) findings of pancreatic injury in blunt trauma and to determine their diagnostic accuracy in predicting main pancreatic duct injury. Fifty-three patients (31 male, 22 female mean 44.1 years) with blunt trauma and admission MDCT findings suspicious for pancreatic injury or who underwent MDCT and had a discharge diagnosis of pancreatic trauma were included in this study. Two radiologists reviewed all images and recorded findings suspicious for pancreatic injury, which were subsequently compared to surgical findings to generate diagnostic accuracy. MDCT imaging findings suggestive of pancreatic injury included low attenuation peripancreatic fluid (n = 51), hyperattenuating peripancreatic fluid (n = 13), pancreatic contusion (n = 7), active hemorrhage (n = 2), and pancreatic laceration (n = 16). Diagnostic accuracy of the various imaging findings varied for diagnosing main duct injury
