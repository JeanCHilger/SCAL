Synchronous portal-superior mesenteric vein or adjacent organ resection for solid pseudopapillary neoplasms of the pancreas: a single-institution experience. Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms of the pancreas (SPN) have been reported increasingly however, series focusing on portal-superior mesenteric vein (PV/SMV) or adjacent organ resection are limited in the literature. The aim of this study was to present our experience in treating patients with SPN who underwent this extensive resection. Ten eligible patients were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. Eight females and two males with a median age of 23 years (range, 11 to 58 years) and a median tumor diameter of 12 cm (range, 4 to 20 cm) were observed. All patients had imaging signs of vascular and/or adjacent organ involvement. Resection with curative intent was performed in all patients
