Emergency management of pancreatic injury in a 5-year-old. Pediatric pancreatic injuries are less common than many other intra-abdominal organ traumatic injuries failure to identify pancreatic injury during the emergency phase will result in delayed diagnosis, delayed treatment, and potentially poor health outcomes. Injured children may present to nontrauma center/nonpediatric hospitals or urgent care settings where practitioners may not be experienced in diagnosing and treating pediatric pancreatic injuries. This case study explores the medical course of a child with persistent abdominal pain after a fall from a horse. He was evaluated in a nonpediatric trauma center and was discharged home, continued with symptoms, presented to a different community emergency department, and then transferred to the emergency department at a Level 1 pediatric trauma center. Educating health care providers about pediatric pancreatic injuries in emergency or urgent care settings will help improve quality of care for injured children who are not initially evaluated in a pediatric specific hospital or trauma center.
