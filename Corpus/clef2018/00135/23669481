A first report of endoscopic ultrasound for the diagnosis of pancreatic amyloid deposition in immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis (primary amyloidosis). Pancreatic involvement in systemic light chain (AL)-amyloidosis is exceedingly rare. Prior reports of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) for the diagnosis of amyloidosis are also limited.We report the first description of EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) for the diagnosis of primary AL-amyloidosis involving the pancreas.EUS-FNA can be effectively utilized for the characterization and cytologic diagnosis of pancreatic amyloidosis and potentially other accessible extraluminal amyloid deposits.
