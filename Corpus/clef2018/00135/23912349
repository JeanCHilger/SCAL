Utility of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration for diagnosis of Burkitt lymphoma in two pediatric cases. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) was performed as a diagnostic procedure for two pediatric patients with intra-abdominal tumors. Case 1 was an 8-year-old boy with a huge tumor in the portal-hepatic region. Case 2 was a 17-year-old girl with a history of diabetes and recurrent relapse of Burkitt lymphoma, who had a newly developing tumor in the pancreatic body. In both cases, EUS-FNA was performed as a less invasive diagnostic procedure than open biopsy or total resection of the tumor. Tumor cells were determined to be of the B cell lineage by flow cytometric and immunostaining analyses. Both cases were diagnosed as having Burkitt lymphoma based on detection of IgH/C-MYC translocation by FISH. The aspiration was successfully conducted without severe complications, and both patients were immediately given chemotherapy. EUS-FNA is a safe and minimally invasive procedure with high diagnostic value for pediatric cases with intra-abdominal tumors.
