A case of IgG4 associated sclerosing cholangitis without clinical manifestations of autoimmune pancreatitis. IgG4-related systemic diseases are characterized by a diffuse or mass forming inflammatory reaction rich in lymphocytes and IgG4-positive plasma cells (lymphoplasmacytic infiltration), fibrosclerosis of variable organs and obliterative phlebitis. They usually involve various organs including the pancreas, bile duct, gallbladder, salivary gland, retroperitoneum, kidney, lung, and prostate. However, most of them are accompanied by autoimmune pancreatitis, and good response to steroid treatment is one of the hallmarks of this disease. We report a case of an 67-year-old man with IgG4 associated sclerosing cholangitis, who was diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and successfully treated with steroid therapy.
