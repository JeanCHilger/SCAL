Ultrasound-guided percutaneous antegrade wirsungography in chronic calcifying pancreatitis. Dilated pancreatic duct was found by ultrasonography in a patient in association with the characteristic sonographic features of chronic calcifying pancreatitis. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography showed an obstruction of the Wirsung's duct 3 cm far from the papilla of Vater. Further parts of the duct could not be opacified by this manner. However, visualisation of the rest of the pancreatic duct was successfully performed by ultrasonically guided antegrade wirsungography making the preoperative planning of the suitable type of surgery possible. Beside the case history the importance of the is method is also discussed in diagnosis of pancreatic diseases.
