Value of near-isovoxel ultrasound for evaluation of ductal communications with pancreatic cystic lesions: correlation with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. The aim of this study was to determine the value of near-isovoxel ultrasound (ISUS) using xMATRIX technology in assessment of ductal communications with pancreatic cystic lesions. Twenty patients with pancreatic cystic lesions (n = 21) on magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), underwent 2-D ultrasound (US) and subsequent ISUS using a matrix probe. Two observers assessed the presence of ductal communications with pancreatic cystic lesions for all MRCP, 2-D US, and ISUS images with multi-planar reformation, using a 5-point confidence scale. Weighted-Îº statistics and intra-class correlation coefficients were calculated. Inter-observer agreement for MRCP, 2-D US and ISUS was moderate, fair and moderate (0.475, 0.222 and 0.472), respectively. The intra-class correlation coefficients between ISUS and MRCP was higher than that between 2-D US and MRCP (0.8706 vs. 0.5353, observer 1 0.7206 vs. 0.4818, observer 2, respectively). Correlation and inter-observer agreement were better with MRCP than with 2-D US. We conclude that ISUS may be useful in evaluating ductal communications with pancreatic cystic lesions.
