The diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms. To analyze the prognostic factors of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (PNEN).Clinical data of 61 patients with PNEN from March 1992 to December 2012 was retrospectively analyzed. There were 23 male and 38 female patients, with a median age of 52 years (ranged from 22 to 68 years). Forty-one patients were non-functional tumors, and 20 patients were functional tumors. Fifty-nine patients received operation, 13 (22.0%) patients underwent laparoscopic operation, 2 patients underwent puncture biopsy under CT guidance. Survival was analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier method.Among these patients, 53 (86.9%) patients underwent curative resection. The cases of grade G1, G2, G3 were 41 (67.2%), 9 (14.8%), 11 (18.0%), respectively. The cases of stageI, II, III, IV were 47 (77.0%), 7 (11.5%), 2 (3.3%), 5 (8.2%), respectively. Liver metastasis, neural invasion were found in 5 cases (8.2%), 5 cases (8.2%), respectively. The median follow-up period was 40 months (ranged from 3 to 209 months). The overall 1-, 3-, 5-year survival rates were 92.0%, 89.7%, 86.3%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed WHO classification (χ(2) = 18.503), TNM staging system (χ(2) = 23.401), liver metastasis (χ(2) = 18.606), neural invasion (χ(2) = 10.091), resection status (χ(2) = 25.514) were prognostic factors of PNEN (all P = 0.000).Surgical resection in PNEN results in long-term survival. WHO classification, TNM staging, resection status are effective in predicting the prognosis of PNEN. Liver metastasis, neural invasion predicted poor prognosis.
