99mTc-labeled cystine knot peptide targeting integrin αvβ6 for tumor SPECT imaging. Integrin αvβ6 is overexpressed in a variety of cancers, and its expression is often associated with poor prognosis. Therefore, there is a need to develop affinity reagents for noninvasive imaging of integrin αvβ6 expression since it may provide early cancer diagnosis, more accurate prognosis, and better treatment planning. We recently engineered and validated highly stable cystine knot peptides that selectively bind integrin αvβ6 with no cross-reactivity to integrins αvβ5, α5β1, or αvβ3, also known to be overexpressed in many cancers. Here, we developed a single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) probe for imaging integrin αvβ6 positive tumors. Cystine knot peptide, S02, was first conjugated with a single amino acid chelate (SAAC) and labeled with [(99m)Tc(H2O)3(CO)3](+). The resulting probe, (99m)Tc-SAAC-S02, was then evaluated by in vitro cell uptake studies using two αvβ6 positive cell lines (human lung adenocarcinoma cell line HCC4006 and pancreatic cancer cell line BxPC-3) and two αvβ6 negative cell lines (human lung adenocarcinoma cell line H838 and human embryonic kidney cell line 293T). Next, SPECT/CT and biodistribution studies were performed in nude mice bearing HCC4006 and H838 tumor xenografts to evaluate the in vivo performance of (99m)Tc-SAAC-S02. Significant differences in the uptake of (99m)Tc-SAAC-S02 were observed in αvβ6 positive vs negative cells (P < 0.05). Biodistribution and small animal SPECT/CT studies revealed that (99m)Tc-SAAC-S02 accumulated to moderate levels in antigen positive tumors (∼2% ID/g at 1 and 6 h postinjection, n = 3 or 4/group). Moreover, the probe demonstrated tumor-to-background tissue ratios of 6.81 ± 2.32 (tumor-to-muscle) and 1.63 ± 0.18 (tumor-to-blood) at 6 h postinjection in αvβ6 positive tumor xenografts. Co-incubation of the probe with excess amount of unlabeled S02 as a blocking agent demonstrated significantly reduced tumor uptake, which is consistent with specific binding to the target. Renal filtration was the main route of clearance. In conclusion, knottin peptides are excellent scaffolds for which to develop highly stable imaging probes for a variety of oncological targets. (99m)Tc-SAAC-S02 demonstrates promise for use as a SPECT agent to image integrin αvβ6 expression in living systems.
