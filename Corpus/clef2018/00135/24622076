Endoscopic ultrasound and histology in chronic pancreatitis: how are they associated? This study aimed to correlate endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) criteria and pathology in patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP).Endoscopic ultrasound reports and pathology specimens were reviewed from patients with known or suspected CP who underwent surgery within 1 year of EUS. The following information was abstracted: EUS criteria for CP, corresponding pathology results, and histologic features. The EUS and pathology results were correlated.One hundred patients (55 men mean age, 54 years) underwent a pancreatic resection, median of 50 days (range, 1-363 days). The mean (SD) fibrosis scores in the head and body/tail specimens were 7.9 (3.0) and 6.4 (3.8), respectively (P = 0.02). The main pancreatic duct (MPD) dilation and irregularity were associated with moderate and severe fibrosis. Lobularity with honeycombing was associated with intralobular and interlobular fibrosis. Severe CP was associated with the following: lobularity with honeycombing, hyperechoic foci with shadowing, hyperechoic foci without shadowing, MPD dilation, MPD irregularity, and dilated side branches.Endoscopic ultrasound of the pancreas head may be considered in the evaluation of CP. The EUS criteria that were associated with severe CP included the following: lobularity with honeycombing, hyperechoic foci with shadowing, dilated MPD, irregular MPD, and dilated side branches. The importance of pancreatic ductal changes should not be minimized in the evaluation of CP.
