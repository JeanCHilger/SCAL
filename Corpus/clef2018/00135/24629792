Solid-pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas: MR imaging findings in 21 patients. Solid-pseudopapillary tumor (SPT) of the pancreas is a rare, low-grade malignancy, which mostly occurs in adolescent and young adult females. The goal of this study was to retrospectively analyze the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging presentation of SPT of the pancreas.We retrospectively reviewed the preoperative MR imaging examinations and the medical, surgical and histopathological records of 21 patients who underwent surgery for SPT of the pancreas. MR imaging included T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and gadolinium chelate-enhanced MR imaging. In addition, 10 patients had diffusion-weighted (DW) MR imaging. MR examinations were retrospectively reviewed for location, size, morphological features and signal intensity of the tumors.Nineteen women and 2 men (median age, 23 years range, 14-59) were included. Seven patients (7/21There is trend of appearance for SPT of the pancreas on MR imaging but that variations may be observed in a number of cases. SPT uniformly presents as a single, well-demarcated and encapsulated pancreatic mass.
