Mimicking pancreatic malignancy: a systemic sarcoidosis. Systemic sarcoidosis that initially presents as a pancreatic mass has rarely been reported. A 47-year-old man presented with idiopathic epigastric abdominal pain. Abdominal CT showed multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the retroperitoneal area and a suspected tumor mass in the pancreatic head region. The preliminary diagnosis was celiac metastasis of a pancreatic malignancy. The definitive diagnosis was systemic sarcoidosis, which was supported by granulomas on histology, clinical radiographic findings, and clinical response to steroids. A review of published reports on sarcoidosis presenting initially as a pancreatic or celiac mass from the Chinese biomedical database (1978-2010) is included.
