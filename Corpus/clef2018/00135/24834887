Reduction of iodine load in CT imaging of pancreas acquired with low tube voltage and an adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction technique. To prospectively assess the contrast enhancement, image quality, radiation dose, and detectability of malignant pancreatic tumors with pancreatic computed tomography (CT) obtained at an 80-kilovolt (peak) (kV[p]) tube voltage setting and reduced iodine dose.Institutional review board approval and written informed consent were obtained. During a recent 10-month period, 136 patients (66 men and 70 women age range, 21-86 yearsThe signal-to-noise ratios in vessels were greater (P < 0.05) in the 400-80 and 500-80 groups than in the 600-120 group, and those in pancreas were comparable between the 400-80 and 600-120 groups. No significant difference was found in effective dose, image quality, lesion-to-pancreas contrast-to-noise ratio, or figure of merit between the groups. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve for detecting malignant pancreatic tumors were comparable between the groups.Pancreatic CT with an 80-kV(p) setting and 400-mg iodine per kilogram contrast material load facilitates the reduction of iodine dose while maintaining image quality and the detectability of malignant pancreatic tumors.
