Solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas in male patients: report of 16 cases. To investigate the clinical characteristics, surgical strategies and prognosis of solid pseudopapillary tumors (SPTs) of the pancreas in male patients.From July 2003 to March 2013, 116 patients were diagnosed with SPT of the pancreas in our institution. Of these patients, 16 were male. The patients were divided into two groups based on gender: female (group 1) and male (group 2). The groups were compared with regard to demographic characteristics, clinical presentations, surgical strategies, complications and follow-up outcomes.Male patients were older than female patients (43.1 ± 12.3 years vs 33.1 ± 11.5 years, P = 0.04). Tumor size, location, and symptoms were comparable between the two groups. All patients, with the exception of one, underwent complete surgical resection. The patients were regularly followed up. The mean follow-up period was 58 mo. Two female patients (1.7%) developed tumor recurrence or metastases and required a second resection, and two female patients (1.7%) died during the follow-up period.Male patients with SPT of the pancreas are older than female patients. There are no significant differences between male and female patients regarding surgical strategies and prognosis.
