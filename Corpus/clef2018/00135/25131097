Surgical salvage of partial pancreatic allograft thrombosis presenting as ruptured pancreatic cyst: a case report. Vascular thrombosis is an important cause of pancreatic graft loss, and the vast majority is managed using graft pancreatectomy. There are limited reports and case series of successful salvage of the pancreas allograft. We describe a case of partial pancreatic allograft thrombosis presenting as ruptured pancreatic cyst successfully salvaged using a graft distal pancreatectomy.We used descriptive retrospective analysis.A 29-year-old patient with type 1 diabetes and end-stage renal failure underwent a simultaneous pancreas kidney transplantation with immediate graft function. The cadaveric pancreas allograft was placed head up in the right iliac fossa with enteric exocrine drainage and standard vascular anastomosis. He presented with compressive symptoms on his bladder 5 months later, and a computed tomography (CT) showed a 4-cm cystic lesion in the body and tail of the pancreas allograft. Spontaneous rupture of the cyst occurred 3 weeks after the initial onset of symptoms with generalized abdominal pain. He underwent graft distal pancreatectomy with good recovery. He remains euglycemic, insulin-free with a normal renal function. Histology of the resected unhealthy graft showed an arterial thrombus with xanthogranulomatous inflammation and necrosis.Surgical salvage with graft distal pancreatectomy is feasible for partial pancreatic allograft thrombosis. Cystic lesion in the pancreas is a possible presentation of vascular thrombosis.
