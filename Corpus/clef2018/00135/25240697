High plasma levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-22 and the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-1ra in acute pancreatitis. Pancreatic acinar cells are major targets of IL-22. Our aim is to study early plasma levels of IL-22, of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in acute pancreatitis, and their association with severity or necrosis infection.Consecutive patients admitted to the Department of Hepato-Gastroenterology at Poitiers University of Medicine Hospital (France) with a diagnosis of AP were prospectively enrolled. Plasma concentrations of IL-22, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1 α, IL-1β, TNF- α, IFN-γ, IL-17A, IL-10, IL-1ra and IL-4 were assessed by multiple immunoassay at the admission time. A thoracoabdominal contrast-enhanced CT scan was performed at day 2.Sixty-two patients were included 13 patients (21%) had a severe acute pancreatitis, 5 patients (8%) developed necrosis infection and 29 patients (47%) had pleural effusion. Plasma levels of IL-22 were high in AP (135 ± 31 vs 4.2 ± 1.8 pg/ml for controls, p < 0.05), but did not correlate with the severity of the disease, whereas IL-6, IL-10 and IL-1ra where enhanced in patients with severe acute pancreatitis and with pleural effusion. Patients who further developed necrosis infection had higher levels of IL-1ra at admission (p = 0.0004).In acute pancreatitis, high plasma levels of IL-22 are observed, regardless the severity of the disease. In contrast, severe forms were associated with increased levels of IL-6, IL-10 and IL-1ra. The beneficial or deleterious role of IL-22 in AP remains to be further studied.
