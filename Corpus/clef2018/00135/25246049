Imaging of pancreatic neoplasms. Ductal adenocarcinoma accounts for 85% to 90% of all solid pancreatic neoplasms, is increasing in incidence, and is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths. There are currently no screening tests available for the detection of ductal adenocarcinoma. The only chance for cure in pancreatic adenocarcinoma is surgery. Imaging has a crucial role in the identification of the primary tumor, vascular variants, identification of metastases, disease response assessment to treatment, and prediction of respectability. Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms can have a distinctive appearance and pattern of spread, which should be recognized on imaging for appropriate management of these patients.
