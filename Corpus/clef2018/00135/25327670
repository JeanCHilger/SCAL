Endosonography in the T-staging of pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer is the sixth among all oncologic diseases and takes the 4th place on cancer mortality in the world. Pancreatic cancer has poor prognosis. Survival for the 5 years after diagnosis is less than 5%. The objective was the evaluation of endosonography diagnostic significance in identification of tumor vascular invasion and tumor resectability. The treatment results of 82 patients with pancreas adenocarcinoma, technique of endosonography, the types of echo-endoscopes and ultrasonic criteria of vascular invasion are presented in the article. Tumor invasion was suspected in 48 patients (58.5%) during endosonography. Tumor invasion into the blood vessels of the upper abdomen was observed in 51 patients (62.2%). Endosonography sensitivity for detection of tumor invasion was 90.2%, specificity - 93.5%, accuracy - 91.5%. In view of modern criteria of pancreatic cancer resectability endosonography is leading method for selection of patients for surgical treatment.
