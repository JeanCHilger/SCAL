Patient dose for computed tomography examination: dose reference levels and effective doses based on a national survey of 2013 in Korea. 14,620 sets of patient dose data were obtained for 31 different models of computed tomography (CT) equipment (total 73) with 18 types of CT examination in Korea. Specific diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) for this study in terms of third quartile volumetric CT dose index in mGy [and dose-length product (DLP) in mGy.cm] are as follows: head, 53 (910) neck, 20 (770)
