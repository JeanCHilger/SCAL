A clinical series of 80 patients with adenosquamous carcinoma of pancreas. To raise the awareness of adenosquamous carcinoma of pancreas and discuss the treatment of it.Clinical data of 80 cases of pancreas adenosquamous carcinoma patients in the Department of Pancreas Surgery of Changhai Hospital of Second Military Medical University from December 2003 to October 2011 were analyzed.

Totally there were 43 cases of head/unciform process tumors, 15 cases of pancreas body tumors and 22 pancreas tail cases.Health situation of all cases were follow-up observed in the outpatient department or telephoned every 3 months till 24 months after the surgery.Among the 80 patients, 19 patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) , 19 patients received pylorus-preserving PD, with 4 cases of palliative resection and 1 case of total pancreatectomy. The volume of bleeding during the surgery varied from 50 to 3 500 ml with a blood transfusion volume varied from 0 to 4 000 ml. Consumed time for PD procedures was 90 to 260 min with 60 to 150 min for body and (or) tail resection with or without lienectomy. The mean diameter of tumor was (4.9 Â± 2.2) cm. Pathological tests showed 35 cases of positive lymph nodes, adjacent organ invasion happened in 35 patients, however, nerve invasion were found in 68 cases.Eighteen cases occurred postoperative complications, including bleeding, pancreatic fistula, gastric emptying, incision fat liquefaction and infection, pleural effusion, ascites and nervous diarrhea. There were only 48 effective follow-up patients, with a loss ratio of follow-up by 40.0%, reasons for the loss includes change of contact information, refuse or unable to provide useful information by the relatives of the patients.Sixteen patients received chemotherapy, and 8 patients received radiotherapy after operation.
