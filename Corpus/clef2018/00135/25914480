Pancreatic fat and β-cell function in overweight/obese children with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. To analyze the associations of pancreatic fat with other fat depots and β-cell function in pediatric nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).We examined 158 overweight/obese children and adolescents, 80 with NAFLD [hepatic fat fraction (HFF) ≥ 5%] and 78 without fatty liver. Visceral adipose tissue (VAT), pancreatic fat fraction (PFF) and HFF were determined by magnetic resonance imaging. Estimates of insulin sensitivity were calculated using the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), defined by fasting insulin and fasting glucose and whole-body insulin sensitivity index (WBISI), based on mean values of insulin and glucose obtained from oral glucose tolerance test and the corresponding fasting values. Patients were considered to have prediabetes if they had either: (1) impaired fasting glucose, defined as a fasting glucose level ≥ 100 mg/dL to < 126 mg/dL (2) impaired glucose tolerance, defined as a 2 h glucose concentration between ≥ 140 mg/dL and < 200 mg/dLPFF was significantly higher in NAFLD patients compared with subjects without liver involvement. PFF was significantly associated with HFF and VAT, as well as fasting insulin, C peptide, HOMA-IR, and WBISI. The association between PFF and HFF was no longer significant after adjusting for age, gender, Tanner stage, body mass index (BMI)-SD score, and VAT. In multiple regression analysis with WBISI or HOMA-IR as the dependent variables, against the covariates age, gender, Tanner stage, BMI-SD score, VAT, PFF, and HFF, the only variable significantly associated with WBISI (standardized coefficient B, -0.398 P = 0.001) as well as HOMA-IR (0.353In overweight/obese children with NAFLD, pancreatic fat is increased compared with those without liver involvement. However, only liver fat is independently related to prediabetes.
