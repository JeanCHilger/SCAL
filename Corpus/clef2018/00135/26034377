Gastric subepithelial lesion complicated with abscess: Case report and literature review. Gastric abscess is a localized pyogenic inflammation of the gastric wall, which is a rare form of suppurative gastritis. The rarity of gastric abscess may be associated with the difficulty of early diagnosis and high mortality as a result. In general, subepithelial lesions (SELs) of the stomach are incidentally detected during the course of upper endoscopy without specific clinical symptoms and signs. However, some gastric SELs present rarely as a form of hemorrhage, obstruction, perforation, and abscess. Here we report a 45-year-old man with gastric SEL presenting as a gastric abscess, which was diagnosed as an ectopic pancreas of the stomach, along with a review of the literature. Although gastric SEL presenting as an abscess is known as a serious and life-threatening lesion, the patient made a complete recovery through surgical resection as well as medical treatment.
