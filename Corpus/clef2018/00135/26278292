A Patient with Pancreatic Castleman's Disease Arising around the Main Pancreatic Duct. Castleman's disease of the pancreas is extremely rare. To the best of our knowledge, Castleman's disease arising around the main pancreatic duct has not been previously reported. The patient was a 74-year-old man. Abdominal ultrasonography performed at a health check-up revealed a dilated main pancreatic duct. Pancreatic cancer was strongly suspected on various imaging studies. However, the results of a cytological examination of the pancreatic juice were negative for malignancy. The patient did not want to undergo a histological diagnosis by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration, thus pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy was performed. Pancreatic Castleman's disease arising around the main pancreatic was diagnosed by the histopathological examination.
