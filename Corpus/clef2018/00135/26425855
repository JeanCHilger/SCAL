A Review of Scientific Topics and Literature in Abdominal Radiology in Germany--Part 2: Abdominal Parenchymal Organs. The working group for abdominal and gastrointestinal diagnosis is a group of the German Radiological Society (DRG) focusing clinically and scientifically on the diagnosis and treatment of the gastrointestinal tract as well as the parenchymal abdominal organs. In this article we give an up-to-date literature review of scientific radiological topics especially covered by German radiologists. The working group experts cover the most recent relevant studies concerning liver-specific contrast media with an emphasis on a new classification system for liver adenomas. Additionally studies regarding selective internal radiotherapy (SIRT) are reviewed. For the pancreas the most important tumors are described followed by an introduction to the most recently introduced functional imaging techniques. The manuscript concludes with some remarks on recent studies and concerning chronic pancreatitis as well as autoimmune pancreatitis.• Different subtypes of liver adenomas with different therapeutic consequences can be differentiated by MRI • Most recently published studies focus on liver imaging with extracellular liver specific contrast media as well as diffusion weighted imaging. They consider this new method having a high diagnostic potential. • For pancreatic neoplasm diagnosis diffusion--as well as perfusion--imaging is considered as a highly promising method.
