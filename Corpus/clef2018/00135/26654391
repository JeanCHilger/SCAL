Computed Tomography Angiography of the Hepatic, Pancreatic, and Splenic Circulation. Multidetector computed tomography angiography (MDCTA) has become a routine imaging tool to assess visceral vascular anatomy and abdominal parenchymal pathology. Enhanced temporal resolution and rapid acquisition allow for precise delineation of arterial and venous anatomy. The excellent spatial resolution permits assessment of small parenchyma lesions and vasculature. The ability of CT to rapidly acquire data and reconstruct with thinner slices allows robust 3D mapping using maximum intensity projection before definitive surgical or interventional therapy. Emerging novel techniques of image acquisition offer sensitive methods for detecting enhancement and allow for virtual imaging subtraction, all while limiting the total radiation burden.
