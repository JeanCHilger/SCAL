The Safety and Feasibility of Conversion Surgery for Initially Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer. By remarkable progress of chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer, we sometimes achieve resection of initially unresectable pancreatic cancer after chemotherapy. Otherwise, the safety and feasibility of radical pancreatic resection after chemotherapy is not still clear. In this report, we evaluated the safety and feasibility of conversion surgery for initially unresectable pancreatic cancer in our center.Between 2009 and 2014, approximately 500 patients were diagnosed with unresectable pancreatic cancer and received chemotherapy, and after chemotherapy, 10 patients were found to have resectable tumors on computed tomography. We evaluated surgical complications using the Clavien-Dindo classification. Clinicopathological data were reviewed by using UICC, seventh edition, and the chemotherapeutic effect was measured by using Evans classification.The mean age of patients was 68 years, with 4 men and 6 women. The preoperative chemotherapy regimens were S-1 chemotherapy in 2 patients, gemcitabine in 5 patients, and gemcitabine plus S-1 chemotherapy in 3 patients. Nine patients underwent pancreatoduodenectomy, and 1 underwent distal pancreatosplenectomy. The mean operative time was 527.5 minutes, and the mean estimated blood loss was 875 mL. Surgery-related morbidity more than Grade 2 based on Clavien-Dindo classification occurred in 6 patients. Mortality was 0%.Our study suggests that conversion surgery for initially unresectable pancreatic cancer is safe and feasible.
