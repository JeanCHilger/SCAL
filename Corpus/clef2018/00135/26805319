Case Report of a Splenic Abscess Due to Colon Cancer. The patient was a 63-year-old man with a chief complaint of fever and abdominal pain. He was admitted with the diagnosis of splenic abscess on enhanced abdominal computed tomography. After improvement of general condition, we planned a colonoscopy. However, the symptoms were not relieved, so we decided to perform splenectomy. The operative findings included a bulky mass at the splenic flexure, which involved the spleen and the pancreatic tail. Therefore, partial colectomy, splenectomy, and distal pancreatectomy were performed. The pathological examination revealed that the splenic abscess had not developed as a direct extension of the colon cancer but the cancer spread to the splenic hilus. Surgical resection is the first choice in the therapy of splenic abscess developing from colon cancer.
