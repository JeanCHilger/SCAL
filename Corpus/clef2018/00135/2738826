Gastrointestinal injuries in childhood: analysis of 53 patients. Gastrointestinal injuries were noted in 53 children. Blunt trauma was responsible for 51 cases, and penetrating wounds in two. There were 42 boys and 11 girls (mean age, 8.1 years). The site of injury was the stomach (2), duodenum (17), jejunum (19), and ileum (15). Types of injury included two gastric perforations, 16 duodenal hematomas, one duodenal laceration, 27 jejunoileal perforations, five mesenteric avulsions, one abdominal wall laceration and evisceration, and one entrapment necrosis between lumbar vertebrae. Diagnosis was accomplished by observing free air on x-ray, with contrast (duodenal haematoma), computed tomography, and frequent examination (noting peritoneal irritation). Thirty-four associated injuries occurred in 21 patients (40%) including the liver (6), pancreas (6), skeletal injury (6), head trauma (5), diaphragm (4), lung (3), spleen (2), and kidney (2). Nine of 16 duodenal hematomas resolved non-operatively, while seven were evacuated during other procedures. Twenty-three of 30 perforations had simple closure, while seven (jejunoileal) were resected. Mesenteric avulsions required resection in five cases--the eviscerated bowel was replaced and the entrapped bowel resected. Twenty complications occurred in 13 patients, including atelectases (6), pseudocyst (5), sepsis (4), wound infection (2), subhepatic abscess (1), subglottic stenosis (1), and short bowel syndrome (1). One infant (aged 2 months) with a duodenal laceration died of head injuries (1/53 = 1.8% mortality). Prompt recognition and appropriate treatment result in improved survival.
