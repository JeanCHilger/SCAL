High-resolution ultrasonography in cancer diagnosis--advances and indication of intraluminal sonography. The present communication deals with recent developments in endoscopic sonography with special reference to the diagnosis of cancer of the upper abdominal organs. Examinations were carried out by an endoscope with a mechanical radial scanner, an Olympus GF UM1 and UM2, LPS UM1. Confirmed diagnostic applications are staging of esophageal and gastric cancer, diagnosis of submucosal tumors of the G.I. tract and differentiation between benign and malignant ulcer of the mucosa. The method also has excellent diagnostic application to malignancies involving organs adjacent to the G.I. tract, such as the mediastinum, retroperitoneum including the pancreas and adrenals, and the left lobe of the liver. Laparoscopic sonography, another endoscope-guided sonography involving the sonolaparoscope, revealed excellent ability to visualize and discriminate between benign and malignant small tumors in the liver and also the gallbladder and pancreas. The method is extremely helpful when surgical intervention is considered. Detection rate of hepatocellular cancer reached almost 90% of cases examined.
