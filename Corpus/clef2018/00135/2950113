Pancreatic cysts and calcification in cystic fibrosis. We describe the computed tomographic (CT) and sonographic appearances of large pancreatic cysts found in a review of pancreatic ultrasonography of two patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Both patients had clinical evidence of pancreatic insufficiency, and one also had evidence of calcification in the body of the pancreas. These cysts, which have rarely been seen in older patients with CF, are not associated with a history of trauma or pancreatitis. Cyst formation requires not only obstruction of the small pancreatic ducts by secretions and cellular debris but also the presence of some residual functioning acinar tissue proximal to the obstruction.
