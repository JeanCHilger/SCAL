Cystic islet cell tumor of the pancreas. Presented is the fifth case of a cystic islet cell tumor of the pancreas. The diagnosis is usually made postoperatively but should be considered in a patient with "recurrent pseudocyst" or a history incompatible with pseudocyst in combination with a cystic area in the pancreas. Computed tomography is preferred for diagnosis, and resection is the preferred therapy.
