Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen--1988. This article reviews the current clinical use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the abdomen with regard to recent technological advances, organ analysis and the integration of MRI in diagnostic imaging. The authors conclude that while MRI is not at present establishing itself as a leading diagnostic imaging method in the abdomen, if MRI machines were to become more widely available, abdominal applications could become a reality.
