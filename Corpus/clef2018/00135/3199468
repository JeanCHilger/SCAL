The role of computed tomography in blunt abdominal trauma in children. This study was performed in order to test the hypothesis that abdominal computed tomography (CT) can assist in the decision to perform laparotomy in children following blunt trauma to the abdomen. Three hundred forty children with blunt abdominal trauma underwent evaluation with CT. Abdominal injuries were detected in 84 children (25%). These included: 75 injuries to solid viscera in 60 patients (30 splenic, 29 hepatic, 13 renal, and three pancreatic) four injuries to hollow viscera (three small bowel transections, and one rupture of the urinary bladder)
