CT scanning in acute abdominal injuries. Computed tomography has become an important adjunct in the evaluation of the patient with blunt abdominal trauma. It provides quantitative information about hemoperitoneum as well as qualitative information about the source of hemoperitoneum. CT scanning also evaluates the retroperitoneal organs and retroperitoneal hematoma more accurately than any other available imaging technique. Like any other diagnostic tool, the CT scan must not be overused or abused. This technique should be applied only to stable patients and only in institutions with up-to-date equipment, a committed radiology and surgery staff, and appropriate monitoring equipment in the CT suite. If proper technique is used, then high-quality scans can be obtained which, if interpreted by experienced personnel in the light of the clinical findings, can improve our management of selected trauma patients.
