Sonographic appearances in biliary ascariasis. Biliary ascariasis is as frequent a cause of adult biliary disease as gallstones in Kashmir Valley, India. In the present study, we prospectively evaluated the role of sonography in the diagnosis of biliary ascariasis and its utility in monitoring the exit of worms from the bile duct. Sonography was performed on 28 patients with biliary ascariasis proven by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. The bile ducts were dilated on sonography in 26 patients. The characteristic sonographic features of worms in the bile duct were as follows: (a) a single, long, linear or curved echogenic structure without acoustic shadowing (2 patients) (b) multiple, long, linear, parallel echogenic strips, usually without acoustic shadowing (15 patients)
