Gastric leiomyosarcoma. Comparative value of barium examinations, ultrasonography and CT scans. The authors discuss four cases of gastric leiomyosarcoma explored by various imaging techniques (barium examinations, ultrasound, CT scans). Barium examinations were normal in two cases, abnormal but insufficient for diagnosis in one, and sufficient to allow topographic diagnosis in one. Ultrasonography gave abnormal findings insufficient for diagnosis in two cases and allowed topographic diagnosis in the other two cases. CT scans were abnormal but insufficient for diagnosis in one case, allowed topographic diagnosis in 3 cases, and in two of the cases permitted initial diagnosis of a connective tissue malignancy. Due to the frequently subserosal nature of leiomyosarcoma of the stomach and of the digestive tract in general, analysis by CT in mandatory. Analysis of tumor relations with the spleen, the left kidney and the pancreas is facilitated by ultrasonography.
