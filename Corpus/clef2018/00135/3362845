Central cavitary necrosis: differentiation from pancreatic pseudocyst on CT scan. Central cavitary necrosis of the pancreas has a computed tomography CT appearance of a well-defined sausage-shaped mass with a low-density center and convex margins, usually conforming to the pancreatic contour. Several other entities, including pancreatic pseudocyst, may have a similar appearance. Since the treatment of central cavitary necrosis differs considerably from that of these other entities, it is important to differentiate them. We present CT criteria that help distinguish central cavitary necrosis from pancreatic pseudocyst and from a variety of other intrapancreatic and peripancreatic masses.
