Single breath-holding scans of the abdomen using FISP and FLASH at 1.5 T. Single breath-holding gradient echo techniques fast imaging with steady-state free precession (FISP) and fast low angle shot (FLASH) images were evaluated in the study of the abdomen in 16 patients (13 liver, two kidney, and one pancreas examinations). Gradient echo images were compared retrospectively with conventional spin echo images for image quality (depiction of pathology and representation of anatomic detail), and contrast characteristics were evaluated. All lesions were shown on gradient echo images, and in three of 16 cases gradient echo images were more diagnostic than spin echo images. On both FISP and FLASH images, most hepatic metastases were hyperintense relative to normal liver. The predicted flip angles for maximal contrast for the liver were modeled from signal intensity equations for FISP and FLASH and yielded predicted flip angles of approximately 40-55 degrees for FISP and 15-25 degrees for FLASH. Peak signal-to-noise ratio in liver of normal volunteers occurred at approximately 30 degrees for both FISP and FLASH. Single breath-holding gradient echo images are useful in the evaluation of abdominal structures and this study provides a framework for future work.
