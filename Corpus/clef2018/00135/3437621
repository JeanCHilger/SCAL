CT guided fine needle aspiration biopsy of biliopancreatic lesions: report of 30 cases. CT guided percutaneous fine needle aspiration biopsy was performed on 30 patients with pancreatic and periampullary neoplasms, in the Department of Surgery, China-Japan Friendship Hospital, between March 1985 and January 1986. We obtained positive cytodiagnosis from all cases of carcinoma of the pancreatic head (9 cases), body and tail (4 cases), and ampullary carcinomas (5 cases) (100 per cent). In 2 of 3 duodenal carcinomas (66.6 per cent), and 6 of 7 distal common duct carcinomas (86 per cent), a positive cytodiagnosis was also obtained. On the other hand, 2 cases of pancreatitis both gave a negative cytodiagnosis, i.e. no false positives were obtained. Out of the 30 cases who underwent CT guided biopsy, a correct diagnosis was obtained in 28, i.e. a diagnostic accuracy of 93.3 per cent. The cytodiagnosis of the other two cases was either suspicious or false negative. There have been no clinical complications noted.
