Two-second MR images: comparison with spin-echo images in 29 patients. MR images can be obtained with a 2-sec scan time when an extremely short repetition rate (22 msec), limited flip angle (30 degrees), and gradient refocused echoes are used. Comparison of 415 such images obtained in 29 patients with routine T1-weighted (TR 500, TE 25) and T2-weighted (TR 2000, TE 80) images showed that images free of respiratory artifacts could be obtained in all patients. Although abdominal organs were well seen with 2-sec scan time, overall evaluation of these organs was better on routine T1-weighted images. Vascular structures, however, were seen as well or better on the 2-sec images in 60% of cases. The images were extremely sensitive to field nonhomogeneity, and metallic artifact was exaggerated in five patients with surgical clips. Two-sec MR images provide a rapid method of localizing abdominal organs for further evaluation. The sensitivity to blood flow may assist in the assessment of vascular patency.
