Percutaneous fine-needle biopsy of the adrenal glands. The percutaneous approach to the adrenal glands is impeded by their high paraaortal subphrenic location. Regarding the information conveyed in literature and referring to our experience, a summary of the technique, indication and findings of percutaneous biopsy of the adrenal gland is presented. Percutaneous needle biopsy of the right adrenal gland is most easily performed by lateral transhepatic approach under sonographic guidance, while in biopsy of the left adrenal gland protection of the spleen, kidney, pancreas and stomach can only be achieved by dorsal approach under CT control. At present, the main indication for biopsy of the adrenal gland still is differentiation between metastases and non-functioning adenomas in tumor patients. Adequate technique provided, the sensitivity of punctures of the adrenal gland varies from 80 to 90%. Clinical suspicion of pheochromocytoma is an absolute contraindication for fine needle biopsy.
