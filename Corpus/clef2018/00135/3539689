Abdominal lymph node tuberculosis: diagnostic value of echography and x-ray computed tomography. The aspects of abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) were studied in 4 patients (3 African and 1 Haitian) with abdominal tuberculosis. All were markedly debilitated and three patients had protracted fever. Tuberculosis was documented in all cases by demonstrating Mycobacterium tuberculosis in cultures of lymph nodes taken during laparotomy and/or cultures of products of gastric aspiration. Ultrasonography showed enlarged lymph nodes in the pancreatic and peripancreatic areas and also in the mesenteric, perivascular and hepatic pedicle areas. CT showed hypertrophied lymph nodes with low tissue density ranging from 20 to 35 Hounsfield units. Although non pathognomonic, these aspects were suggestive of tuberculosis. Intravenous contrast medium administration failed to increase the density in the center of lymph nodes but disclosed the existence of a thick hyperdense rim surrounding the hypodense center of the caseous lymph nodes. Repeated ultrasound and CT examination allowed to control the efficacy of antituberculous chemotherapy.
