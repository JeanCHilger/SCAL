CT-guided percutaneous fine needle aspiration cytodiagnosis of pancreatic and periampullary tumors. CT guided percutaneous fine needle aspiration cytodiagnosis was performed on 30 patients with pancreatic and periampullary tumors in China-Japan Friendship Hospital from November 1984 to January 1986. In our series, 9 pancreatic head cancers, 4 pancreatic body and tail cancers, 5 ampullary cancers had positive cytodiagnosis (100%-18/18). 2 of 3 (67%) duodenal cancers and 6 of 7 (86%) the distal common bile duct cancers were positive by cytodiagnosis. 2 pancreatitis were negative (100%). The positive rate by CT guided diagnosis was 93.3% (28/30). In the same period, ultrasonically guided percutaneous fine needle aspiration cytodiagnosis was performed on 30 patients with pancreatic and periampullary tumors, a correction rate of diagnosis was 67%. CT guided procedure is more accurate than that ultrasonically guided.
