Pancreatic pseudocyst in childhood. Pancreatic pseudocysts are rare in children, with different etiology and prognosis than adults. We report four cases of post-traumatic pancreatic pseudocysts with their follow-up by echography and CT scan. Spontaneous resolution has been observed in three patients while one case was operated on. The better prognosis of the pancreatic pseudocyst in childhood, confirmed by our clinical observations and literature, lead us to promote a more conservative management and follow-up than in adults.
