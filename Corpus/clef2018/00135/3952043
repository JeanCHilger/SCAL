Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Its role in diagnosis and therapy of pancreatitis. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is helpful in the diagnosis and therapy of acute pancreatitis under certain conditions. It is useful in gallstone-induced pancreatitis and in preoperative evaluation of patients with severe, protracted acute pancreatitis. It may also be helpful in certain cases of hemorrhagic pancreatitis, but confirmatory evidence is needed in this area. Before ERCP is performed, the increased risks of the procedure must be weighed against the potential benefits. Minimum use of contrast medium and careful fluoroscopic control are required.
