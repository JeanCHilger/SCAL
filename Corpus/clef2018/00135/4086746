Percutaneous biopsy of pancreatic masses. Forty-five percutaneous needle biopsies of pancreatic masses were performed in 41 patients in whom there was clinical or radiological concern for the diagnosis of cancer. Computed tomography (CT) was the imaging technique used in 41 of the 45 biopsies. An overall sensitivity of 85%, specificity of 100%, and accuracy rate of 88% were achieved, with serious complications in three of the 45 attempts (6.7%). These figures show that percutaneous pancreatic biopsies have the potential for greater accuracy than has been previously reported and are relatively safe when compared with surgery.
