Screening for multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome (type 1) in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. In 63 consecutive patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) a prospective screening study was undertaken for coexistent multiple endocrine neoplasma-(MEN)-syndrome type 1. The screening consisted of a clinical examination, a radiological examination of the sella turcica with skeletal tomography (and in equivocal cases computed tomography), visual field examination by perimetry and a hormonal evaluation including measurements of the serum levels of prolactin, gastrin, pancreatic polypeptide (PP) and subunits of human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG-alpha and -beta). Clinical examination did not reveal any signs of endocrine disease suggestive of a MEN-1 syndrome. In only one case there was a radiological abnormality of the sella turcica this patient had an empty sella syndrome and a raised serum prolactin value. All other prolactin values were within the normal range. In 41% of the patients raised serum gastrin levels were found
