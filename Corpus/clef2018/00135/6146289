Zollinger-Ellison syndrome--report of four cases and review of literature. Four patients with Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome (ZES) are presented to highlight the difficulties in the recognition, diagnosis and management of this rare disease. The presentation of ZES is usually indistinguishable from ordinary peptic ulcer disease and in those patients with symptoms not related to peptic ulcer, i.e., diarrhoea, as their main complaint, the diagnosis is often not even considered. A high index of suspicion is required, however, in patients with recurrent ulcers, multiple ulcers and in those with resistant or rapidly relapsing ulcers after conventional therapy. A presumptive diagnosis can be made by the demonstration of grossly elevated fasting serum gastrin levels combined with a secretin stimulation test in doubtful cases. The main problem is the location of the gastrin-secreting tumour which is usually pancreatic but often too small to be detected by currently available techniques. Histamine H2-receptor antagonists in high doses are effective in controlling the gastric acid hypersecretion which is chiefly responsible for the morbidity and mortality in ZES. They provide the treatment of choice in patients where the tumour cannot be located, though every attempt should be made to do this as surgery is the treatment of choice for this invariably malignant tumour. Total gastrectomy is now reserved for those patients in whom medical therapy has failed. The role of chemotherapy in metastatic disease has yet to be established.
