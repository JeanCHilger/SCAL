Percutaneous fine needle aspiration biopsy of pancreatic carcinoma. Carcinoma of the pancreas was diagnosed in 13 patients by percutaneous fine needle aspiration. The tumor was localized by angiography in eight, ultrasound in five, and endoscopic retrograde pancreatography in three patients. In four patients aspiration was performed using two of the three localizing techniques. Cytological diagnosis of carcinoma of the pancreas can be made accurately by percutaneous fine needle aspiration of the tumor and operative intervention avoided in those patients who do not require operative bypass procedures. Percutaneous fine needle aspiration can be used with equal facility with arteriography, ultrasound, or endoscopic retrograde pancreatography. There have not been complications due to fine needle biopsy, and one can expect a 77-86% positive diagnostic yield.
