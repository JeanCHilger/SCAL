Islet cell cancer with organic hyperinsulinism. Clinical aspects, diagnosis and therapy. About 8%-15% of the patients with organic hyperinsulinism have an islet cell carcinoma (13% in our series). In addition to a history of complaints of relatively recent onset, the patients present clinically the typical intermittent neurologic-psychiatric symptoms concurrently associated with hypoglycemia. The diagnosis is established biochemically on the basis of hypoglycemia, with inadequate incrementation of the insulin concentration subsequent to suppression and provocation tests. Elevated serum proinsulin and, in most patients, an increased insulin secretion rate are usually found after administration of agents such as glucose or leucine. Localization of the tumors is achieved by selective coeliacography as well as abdominal computerized axial tomography. The islet cell carcinoma is found most frequently in the tail of the pancreas, less frequently in the body and head of the pancreas. Metastatic spread is seen early into adjacent lymph nodes and especially in the liver. The treatment of choice is surgical resection of the tumor. Even in cases with advanced metastatic involvement, surgical intervention appears indicated. Medical treatment includes the administration of diazoxide, long-acting glucagon as well as the cytostatic agent streptozotocin. The average survival time is 30-40 months after diagnosis (in our series 79 months). Thus, the prognosis of patients with islet cell carcinoma appears relatively favorable, especially when compared with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.
