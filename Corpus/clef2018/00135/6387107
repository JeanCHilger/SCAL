Voluminous exogastric myoid tumor. Contribution of echotomography and x-ray computed tomography. We described a case of voluminous exogastric leiomyoblastoma revealed by abdominal pain and clinical mass. Ultrasonography showed a mixed mass, with both solid and liquid components, without determining specifically the organ of origin. CT body examination showed an intense hypervascularization, associated with cystic components. Laparotomy with tumor excision was done without any metastases. Such US and CT aspects can lead to the exact diagnostic, if they prove the gastric origin of the mass. Otherwise, the discussion is between pancreatic or epiploic tumors.
