Echinococcus cysticus of the pancreas in the clinical picture of acute pancreatitis. A 30-year-old Italian male was admitted to the hospital showing all clinical signs of acute pancreatitis. With the help of computerized tomography, ultrasonic and angiographic methods multiple cysts in pancreatic body and tail as well as close to the hilus of the spleen could be shown. Positive serological tests made the diagnosis "echinococcus granulosus" likely. Resection of the left part of the pancreas as well as resection of the spleen eliminated the parasite. Histologically hydatid cyst was traceable in the pancreatic duct.
