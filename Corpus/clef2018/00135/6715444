Pancreatic cystadenocarcinomas. Apropos of a case and review of the literature. A patient with a pancreatic cystadenocarcinoma was treated initially for a false pancreatic cyst by means of a Y loop, and then by total pancreatectomy three weeks later. Although the prognosis for these tumors amongst the group of pancreatic carcinomas is usually greatly improved, the patient died 6 months after detection of the lesion. However, a literature review also suggested possible prolonged survival in these cases when the tumors are discovered early enough and local or regional spread is absent: wide excision of the tumor without the need for total pancreatectomy may then be sufficient. The "false cyst" appearance frequently taken by this slowly progressing malignant affection has to be emphasized, as well as the need for the renewed classification of these tumors: serous cystadenomas are always benign and must be separated from mucinous cystadenomas that are malignant or are potentially malignant. A CT scan appears to be the investigational procedure providing the most accurate data for determining the limits of surgical excision.
