Spontaneous obliteration of pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysm after retroperitoneal hemorrhage. We present a rare case of aneurysm of the pancreaticoduodenal artery that bled into the region of the head of the pancreas. Computed tomography (CT) demonstrated the presence and extent of the resultant mass (hematoma) but the angiographic examination allowed a specific diagnosis via visualization of the aneurysm. Unlike previously reported cases, the patient was treated conservatively. Follow-up arteriogram and CT showed spontaneous closure of the pancreaticoduodenal artery and aneurysm and complete resolution of the mass in the pancreatic head. These findings suggest that in some cases a conservative approach to a bleeding pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysm may be indicated.
