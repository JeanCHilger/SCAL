Percutaneous fine needle biopsy (P.F.N.B.) of intra-abdominal lesions. Four hundred and seventeen percutaneous fine needle biopsies (P.F.N.B) have been performed in 405 patients. Two hundred and thirteen had a focal lesion of the liver, 116 a lesion of the pancreas, 74 an abdominal mass and 14 miscellaneous lesions. Real-time ultrasound has been used as a method of guidance in 90% of cases, fluoroscopy in 7% and computed tomography (CT) in 3%. The main indication for P.F.N.B. was detection of malignant lesions which represent 70% of the 338 proven cases. In these 338 cases, P.F.N.B. was successful in 310 (92%) and results were non-conclusive in 28 (8%). Sensitivity of P.F.N.B. in detection of malignancy of the liver, pancreas of abdominal masses was respectively 92%, 77% and 85%. Specificity was respectively 100%, 100% and 94%. Non-malignant lesions included benign solid tumours, cystic lesions or abscesses. Three symptomatic complications occurred in the 405 patients (0.75%). P.F.N.B. complements imaging procedures, especially real-time ultrasound, in obtaining a specific diagnosis of focal lesions within the abdomen.
