Vascular complications associated with sonographically demonstrated cystic epigastric lesions: an important indication for angiography. Posttraumatic epigastric cystic lesions visualized on ultrasound or computed tomography examination should be further assessed by angiography. Additionally, a sudden increase in the size of a previously diagnosed pseudocyst, particularly if internal echoes develop or increase, warrants angiographic evaluation. Five patients are described with cystic lesions in the epigastric area noted by ultrasonography. Four were demonstrated by angiography to have life-threatening hemorrhage resulting from arterial erosions.
