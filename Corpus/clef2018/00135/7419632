Cystadenomas or rather microcystic adenomas and mucinous cysts of the pancreas (author's transl). Basing their observations on 11 cases treated personally and 74 cases reported in the published literature, the authors use the histological findings and the course taken by the lesions to separate pancreatic cystadenomas into microcystic adenomas and mucinous cysts. Their classification as a single clinical entity is justified by their almost indentical symptoms : usually of large size and seen mainly in women. A more precise diagnosis requires the use of complementary examinations including ultrasonography, arteriography, and computed tomography. Microcystic adenomas occur throughout the gland and are always benign : mucinous cysts are found mainly in the head or tail regions and may become malignant. Histological examination of the whole lesion is necessary in order to recognize a primary malignant form, and radical excision is required. The risk of changes in any cystic lesion, therefore, implies that controlled excision should be employed rather than simple cystectomy.
