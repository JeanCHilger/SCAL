Late presentation of an alpha-fetoprotein secreting isolated large upper abdominal retroperitoneal Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor recurrence. The following case reports the surgical and adjuvant treatment of a solitary upper abdominal retroperitoneal recurrence of a poorly differentiated Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor (SLCT) which presented 4 years after the original diagnosis. The patient was treated with en bloc resection of the mass, which included her left kidney, adrenal gland, and distal pancreas. She received four courses of adjuvant chemotherapy and remains without evidence of malignancy. Both the primary and recurrent tumor secreted alpha-fetoprotein allowing serologic follow-up. The utility of serum alpha-fetoprotein in disease response to treatment and for surveillance of recurrence is also shown.
