Diagnostic laparoscopy combined with laparoscopic ultrasonography in staging of cancer of the pancreatic head region. The aim of this study was to assess the additional role of diagnostic laparoscopy combined with laparoscopic ultrasonography in the staging of patients with pancreatic head malignancy. Between January 1993 and June 1994, 73 patients with stage I cancer of the pancreatic head determined by preoperative investigation (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and Doppler ultrasonography) were eligible for laparoscopic ultrasonography. The peritoneal cavity was investigated for peritoneal deposits, intrahepatic metastases, malignant infiltration of the portal and superior mesenteric vessels, and N3 lymph node metastases. All patients without histologically proven metastases proceeded to laparotomy. Seventy patients were eligible for evaluation. Sixteen of the 21 patients with distant metastases were diagnosed by laparoscopy with ultrasonography. Forty-nine patients had surgical exploration and trial dissection to assess local resectability. Twenty-nine patients (41 per cent) had resectable pancreatic head tumours. The positive predictive value of local ingrowth as determined by laparoscopic sonography was 93 per cent. Laparotomy was avoided in 19 per cent of patients and the preoperative stage was changed in 41 per cent. Laparoscopy including ultrasonography was effective in staging pancreatic head malignancy.
