A pilot study of preoperative chemoradiation for patients with localized adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. We hypothesized that delivering adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) preoperatively with chemotherapy might enhance local control of the cancer and patient tolerance for the intervention.Thirty-four patients with localized pancreatic cancer (24 head, 8 head and body, 2 body and tail) were treated during the past 6 years with an intramural protocol consisting of 5-fluorouracil (1,000 mg/m2 on days 2 to 5 and 29 to 32) and mitomycin-C (10 mg/m2 on day 2) given with preoperative external beam RT (median 5,040 cGy). Nine patients did not have surgery: 1 refused, 1 died of cholangitis, and 7 were noted to have distant (5) or unresectable local cancer (2) after RT. Of the 25 patients who underwent celiotomy, 11 had liver (8) or peritoneal (3) metastases and 3 had palliative pancreatectomies (2 with liver metastasectomy and 1 with hepatic artery and portal vein replacement). The remaining 11 patients (44% of the cohort with surgery, 32% of all patients) had potentially curative (PC) resections (5 total pancreatectomy, 5 Whipple, 1 distal pancreatectomy). Median tumor diameter by computed tomographic scan was 3.75 cm (range 3 to 5) for the 11 patients who received PC resections and 4.5 cm (range 3 to 7.5) for all patients. Of the 11 patients with PC resections, 8 had evidence of superior mesenteric, portal or splenic venous involvement and 4 had been deemed unresectable at previous celiotomies.One patient developed respiratory failure and one died postoperatively, yielding a 9% rate of major morbidity and mortality. Median follow-up of the surviving patients with curative resection is 33 months (range 14 to 70). Their median survival from the time of tissue diagnosis is 45 months with a median disease-free survival of 27 months. The product limit estimate of 5-year survival is 40% (95% confidence bounds +29%, -30%). One patient had a microscopically positive resection margin, which was a falsely negative frozen section margin at the pancreatic neck. Two patients had positive regional lymph nodes. Five patients have been diagnosed with recurrent cancer. Only 1 has had a local/regional component to the recurrence.Preoperative RT and chemotherapy followed by resection is well tolerated and safe for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. This approach provides tumor free resection margins and offers prolonged survival to patients with truly localized pancreatic cancer.
