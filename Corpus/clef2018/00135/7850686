Intraductal mucin-hypersecreting papillary adenocarcinoma of the pancreas: a case report. A 68-year-old male was admitted with jaundice and abdominal fullness. Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) scan showed a diffusely dilated main pancreatic duct (MPD) with microcystic lesions over the pancreatic head and dilatation of the biliary tract. Duodenoscopy revealed mucin secretion at the orifice of the papilla of Vater. Findings of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) were compatible with a mucinous tumor of pancreas invading the common bile duct. The patient was treated with a modified Whipple's operation. Pathological diagnosis was papillomatosis with papillary adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.
