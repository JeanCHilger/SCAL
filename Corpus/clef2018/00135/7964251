Inferior vena cava stenosis and pancreatic ascites complicating chronic calcific pancreatitis: a case report. A 19-year-old Thai male, who was a regular drinker, presented with massive ascites, back pain and leg edema for four months. On examination there was obvious clinical evidence of an inferior vena cava obstruction. Inferior vena cavography showed narrowing of the hepatic portion of IVC with collateral circulation. Surgical dilatation of the inferior vena cava was performed. The ascites were diagnosed four months later as pancreatic ascites with a very high ascitic amylase level. Computerised axial tomography and endoscopic retrograde pancreatography showed evidence of chronic calcific pancreatitis and pseudocyst. After further medical treatment, ascites and inferior vena cava stenosis subsided which was confirmed by repeated vena cavography, computerised axial tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. The cause of inferior vena cava stenosis and clinical obstruction in this case most likely resulted from phlebitis secondary to pancreatitis. The etiology of chronic calcific pancreatitis in this case might be alcoholic abuse and/or nutritional tropical pancreatitis. Inferior vena cava stenosis and associated pancreatic ascites complicating chronic calcific pancreatitis has not been previously reported in Thailand.
