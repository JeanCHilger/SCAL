Case report: prolapse of an ampullary tumour beyond the duodeno-jejunal flexure. We report unusual barium, computed tomographic (CT) and ultrasound appearances of a polypoid ampullary tumour which prolapsed beyond the duodeno-jejunal (DJ) flexure. The extensive mucosal prolapse gave rise to radiological signs suggestive of an intussusception.
