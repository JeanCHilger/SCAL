Pancreatic metastases: sonographic and computed tomographic findings. We analysed sonographic (n = 19) and CT (n = 15) findings in 19 patients with intrapancreatic metastases (solitary: n = 8, multiple: n = 11) from solid tumours. The diagnosis was confirmed either histologically (n = 5) or by the follow-up showing decrease of the size of the lesion due to chemotherapy (n = 3) or progression without specific therapy (n = 11). Clinically or serologically organ-related symptoms were found in 5 cases, whereas the rest of the patients were free of symptoms. Sonographically the metastases appeared hypoechogeneic compared to normal pancreatic parenchyma. In 15 cases CT at the time of sonographic investigation demonstrated hypodense intrapancreatic lesions (8/15) or bulging of the organ contour without differences in density (2/15). In some patients (5/15) sonographically detected metastases measuring less than 2 cm were not discovered via CT. In a patient with known malignancy multiple intrapancreatic lesions must be considered as metastases. Differential diagnosis includes diffusely growing pancreatic carcinoma, haemorrhagic necrotising pancreatitis and focal infiltrates due to malignant lymphoma.
