Digestive hemorrhage undiagnosed by conventional endoscopy. Digestive bleeding undiagnosed by conventional endoscopies occurs in about 5% of the patients with gastro-intestinal bleeding. Vascular ectasias are the most common cause. More than half of these tumors are benign. Meckel's diverticulum is the cause of bleeding in two thirds of men under the age of 30. Hemorrhage from the biliary tree or pancreatic duct occurs more often in patients with a suggestive history. According to the abundance and the cause of hemorrhage numerous investigations can be undertaken and the diagnostic value of new endoscopic methods (enteroscopy, endoscopic ultrasonography) must be assessed.
