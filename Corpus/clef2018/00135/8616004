Papillary tumor of the pancreas diagnosed by fine-needle aspiration. We report the case of a 48 year-old woman with an epigastric palpable mass identified by abdominal echography and computed tomography as a solid pancreatic tumor. A cytology taken by fine needle aspiration guided by computed tomography was diagnostic of papillary pancreatic tumor, which was confirmed by surgical resection. We emphasize the low frequency and good prognosis of this type of tumor after surgical resection, and the utility of image techniques and fine needle aspiration to obtain a preoperative diagnosis.
