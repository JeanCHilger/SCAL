Acute pancreatitis and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Viral acute pancreatitis in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected patients has been occasionally described. We studied nine patients with HIV antibodies and acute pancreatitis attributed to Cytomegalovirus and/or Cryptosporidium infection. In four patients the clinical picture was consistent with acute pancreatitis while in five clinical manifestations were unspecific, and diagnosis was based on ultrasonography and/or computed tomography findings. In the HIV infected patient pancreatic evaluation by imaging techniques may disclose acute pancreatitis even in the absence of abdominal pain.
