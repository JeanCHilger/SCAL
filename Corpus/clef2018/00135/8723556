Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor produced by pancreatic carcinoma. A rare case of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) produced by carcinoma of the pancreas has been reported.This is the first case showing high G-CSF concentration in the aspirated tumor fluid (mucin) at its early stage without leukocytosis.The tumor, detected incidentally in a 64-yr-old male, was removed by a distal pancreatectomy. The mass was 7.0 x 6.5 x 4.5 cm, and was histologically diagnosed as cystadenocarcinoma with prominent sarcomatous transformation. It was classified as anaplastic carcinoma.After 4 wk of resection, progressive leukocytosis was observed. Seven weeks after the operations, the peripheral leukocyte count increased to 126,000/mL. After 8 wk of resection, the patient died of recurrence. The serum G-CSF concentration was elevated after recurrence. The preserved mucin contained in the cystic components of the resected specimen had a G-CSF concentration higher than 2400 pg/mL. G-CSF is a known cytokine and an etiologic agent in paraneoplastic syndromes. An early diagnosis can, therefore, be made prior to the manifestation of clinical symptoms by the evaluation of the aspirated tumor fluid. This can lead to the prevention of the paraneoplastic syndrome with inhibitory cytokines in future.
