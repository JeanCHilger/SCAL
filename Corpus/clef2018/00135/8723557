Serous cystadenoma of the pancreas communicating with a pancreatic duct. To differentiate serous cystadenoma from other cystic lesions communicating with the pancreatic duct, careful radiological examination is necessary.Communication between the cystic cavity and the pancreatic duct in an ordinary serous cystadenoma is uncommon, although it is not uncommon in other cystic lesions, such as pseudocyst, mucinous cystadenoma/adenocarcinoma, and intraductal papillary tumor. METHODS. A serous cystadenoma of the pancreas communicating with main pancreatic duct in a 76-yr-old male is reported.The communication was preoperatively demonstrated by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and confirmed by histopathological examination of the resected specimen.
