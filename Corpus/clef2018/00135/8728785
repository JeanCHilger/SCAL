Endoscopic therapy of pancreatic pseudocyst. Endoscopy therapy of pancreatic pseudocyst has been described as an efficient method. We report six cases of pancreatic pseudocyst treated by pancreatic stenting (three cases), cystogastrostomy (three cases) and cystoduodenostomy (one case). Rapid symptomatic improvement and pseudocyst regression were noted in all cases, except one. Such patient needed pancreatic stenting even after cystogastrostomy due to main pancreatic duct stenosis. There were three complications: hemorrhage (one case) and pseudocyst infection (two cases), and all were treated clinically. Two patients had pseudocyst infection previous to endoscopic manipulation, and they were treated only with antibiotics and endoscopic drainage, without surgery (treatment suggested by most of the authors). We concluded that endoscopic therapy of pancreatic pseudocyst is efficient and safe, being responsible for rapid relief of symptoms in most of patients.
