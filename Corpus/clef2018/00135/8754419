Chronic calcifying pancreatitis and extracorporeal pancreatic lithotripsy. Abdominal pain is the most frequent symptom of chronic pancreatitis and may, on occasions, lead to great treatment problems. The case of a 35-years-old patient diagnosed with chronic calcifying pancreatitis of enolic etiology who showed dilatation of the main pancreatic duct and intracanalicular lithiasis is reported. Medical, endoscopic and surgical alternatives failed but fragmentation of the lithiasis by extracorporeal lithotripsy was successful.
