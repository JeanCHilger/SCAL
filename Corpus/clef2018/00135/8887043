Pancreatic cancer and hypercalcemia associated with von Recklinghausen's disease. A 44-year-old man with von Recklinghausen's disease was admitted to our hospital presenting with left hypochondralgia. Computed tomography showed a large mass at the body and tail of the pancreas, with metastatic liver tumors. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography revealed an obstruction of the main pancreatic duct at the body. In the course of the illness, the patient's serum calcium concentration increased gradually to 13.6 mg/dl, although bone scan with 99mtechnetium demonstrated no accumulation in the bones. Serum levels of parathyroid hormone related-protein and tumor necrosis factor were also elevated. Based on these findings, he was diagnosed as having pancreatic cancer with liver metastases and humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy associated with von Recklinghausen's disease. Postmortem examination revealed a solid tumor, measuring 6.0 x 6.0 x 8.0 cm, in the body and tail of the pancreas. Histologically, the tumor was moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. The association of von Recklinghausen's disease with malignant neurogenic neoplasms is well established, whereas the association with non-neurogenic malignant neoplasm is considered to coincidental. Our current case suggests a possible relationship between von Recklinghausen's disease and pancreatic cancer.
