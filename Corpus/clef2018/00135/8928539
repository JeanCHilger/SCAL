Paraneoplastic spastic tetraparesis in glucagonoma syndrome. Successful therapy with octreotide, dacarbazine and interferon-alpha. Within four years a 44-year-old man developed a glucagonorma syndrome with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, weight loss, diarrhea, anemia and a marked superinfected eczema. He developed an organo-cerebral psychosyndrome with cognitive retardation and syncoptic disturbance of consciousness, followed by a tetraspasticity with tetraparesis, micturition difficulties and fecal incontinence. There were a general cerebral atrophy as verified by means of MRT and signs of a demyelinating cerebral disease. The plasma concentration of glucagon was 48 fold elevated to 8,536 ng/l. By means of ultrasonography, CT, ERCP, and angiography a tumorous mass of the corpus and tail of the pancreas, 61 x 32 mm in size, was found with signs of infiltration into the region of the aorta and the splenic vein. Furthermore the liver showed diffuse partially cystic metastases. The diagnosis was certified by fine needle biopsy and histologic examination with Grimelius straining. A thrombosis of the femoral vein was detected by CT. The patient was treated by a debulking resection of the corpus and cauda of the pancreas combined with splenectomy and a drug therapy using octreotide. All paraneoplastic symptoms could be widely reduced. Plasma glucagon concentration decreased from 2,200 ng/l to 600 ng/l. Because of a liver enlargement due to the growth of metastases he was successfully treated with dacarbazine 250 mg/m2 per day during six monthly cycles for five days and interferon-alpha 3 x 3 millions units per week for six months followed by a normalization of the liver volumen.
