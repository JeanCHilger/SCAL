Current diagnosis and treatment of early pancreatic cancer. In the present study our current experience of early pancreatic cancer is described. The early pancreatic cancer was defined when the tumor was located within the pancreas and/or less than 2 cm in diameter. Between 1983 and 1995, 9 out of 183 cases with pancreatic cancer were fulfilled with the criteria of early pancreatic cancer. Among the diagnostic modalities including US, CT, ERP, balloon ERP-CS and EUS, the balloon ERP-CS as well as EUS appears the most valuable procedure for making diagnosis of small pancreatic cancer. Currently, 8 out of 9 patients are alive at 1-10 years after surgery.
