Magnetic resonance angiography in the resectability assessment of suspected pancreatic tumours. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate MRI, including MR angiography (MRA), in the preoperative assessment of the resectability of suspected malignancy of the pancreas. A total of 17 patients with suspected pancreatic carcinoma and planned surgery were investigated with conventional angiography, ultrasonography with Doppler technique, MRI and MRA. The MRA protocol included both 2D inflow angiography and 3D phase-contrast angiography. Surgery was carried out in 13 patients. The image quality of MRA was judged satisfactory in all cases. The findings with respect to vascular involvement agreed between the radiological methods in all but 3 cases. When the findings were correlated with the final diagnosis, one false-negative case was found for each of the three methods. The results suggest that MRI with MRA, including both the phase-contrast and inflow techniques, has a similar diagnostic value to that of conventional angiography and ultrasonography in the preoperative assessment of the portal venous system in patients with pancreatic carcinoma. Further studies are needed to establish the optimal diagnostic procedure.
