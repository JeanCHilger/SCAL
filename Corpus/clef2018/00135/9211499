Pancreatic schwannoma: report of two cases and review of the literature. Solitary intrapancreatic schwannoma is a rare tumor. We present two patients with this tumor and review 13 previously reported cases from the English-language literature. While the final diagnosis was made based on pathological examination of the tumors, both computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging helped establish the benign nature of the lesion, narrow the differential diagnosis, and define the anatomical locations of the small tumors. Both tumors were treated by enucleation from the surrounding pancreatic parenchyma, and both patients, after 2 years of follow-up, are alive and well. It is concluded that multimodality radiologic investigations are useful in the workup of unusual pancreatic masses. In addition, based on the known biologic behavior of schwannomas occurring elsewhere in the body, simple enucleation, rather than more radical resection, is likely to be adequate therapy for these tumors.
