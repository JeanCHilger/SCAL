Overview of MnDPDP as a pancreas-specific contrast agent for MR imaging. To describe and discuss previous and ongoing clinical and experimental studies with MnDPDP (Teslascan) as a pancreas-specific contrast agent for MR imaging.All results, both experimental and clinical, applying MnDPDP as a pancreas-specific contrast agent for MR imaging, were collected.An increase of up to 100% in signal intensity was seen in normal pancreatic parenchyma, reaching its maximum approximately 25 min after the beginning of MnDPDP administration. Maximal enhancement was sustained for 4 h. Enhancement was only seen in the T1-weighted images. No enhancement was observed in tumours and an increase in contrast-to-noise of about 200% was obtained. The uptake of MnDPDP in pancreatitis compared with normal pancreatic parenchyma was decreased in an animal model.Improved depiction and demarcation of pancreatic tumours with MR imaging were obtained after administration of MnDPDP. MR imaging with and without MnDPDP might be valuable for staging of pancreatitis.
