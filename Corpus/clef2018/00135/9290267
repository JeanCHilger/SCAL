Three-dimensional magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography for evaluation of obstructive jaundice. The purpose of this study was to assess the diagnostic value of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) in studying the anatomy, sites, and causes of obstructive jaundice. From September 1994 to May 1996 three-dimensional MRCP was performed on 31 patients with abdominal pain and obstructive jaundice with a fast spin-echo T2-weighted pulse sequence. The images were reconstructed using maximal intensity projection, AVERAGE and SURFACE algorithm processing techniques at a graphics workstation. All the reconstructed images were compared with those obtained using conventional cholangiographic techniques, such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography and drainage, and intraoperative cholangiography. The patients' diagnoses included choledochal cyst (13), cholangiocarcinoma (five), choledocholithiasis (four), pancreatic head carcinoma (three), rhabdomyosarcoma (one), papillary Vater carcinoma (one), recurrent gastric carcinoma (one), ascaris (one), and biliary atresia (two). Extrahepatic biliary dilatation was present in all 13 patients with choledochal cyst the pancreatic ducts and their entrance level to the common bile duct were observed in eight of these patients. The level of obstruction in patients with cholangiocarcinoma was well documented but the biliary tract of one patient with biliary atresia was not identified by MRCP. In one patient with biliary rhabdomyosarcoma, MRCP clearly delineated the extrabiliary extension of the tumor. In a patient with ascaris in the common bile duct an increase in signal intensity inside the digestive tract of the worm denoted fluid in its gut. Lithiasis was shown in all of the four patients with choledocholithiasis. Thus, MRCP is a useful tool in the assessment of biliary tract obstruction and its causes, and is a valuable addition to ultrasonography.
