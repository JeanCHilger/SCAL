Abdominal tuberculous lymphadenitis simulating pancreatis cancer. The Authors report the case of a patient symptomatic for fever, weight loss and abdominal pain submitted to abdominal sonography and CT which identified a mass of the pancreatic head. The patient underwent laparotomy plus biopsy the istologic and bacteriological diagnosis demonstrated a tuberculous lymphoadenitis in spite of a normal cutaneous tuberculin test. Abdominal localization of TBC infection therefore is increasing in epidemiological studies, and thus it must be included in the differential diagnosis of subdiaphragmatic disease.
