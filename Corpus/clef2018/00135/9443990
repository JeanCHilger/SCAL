The role of endosonography in the diagnosis and management of pancreatic cancer. Among the various diagnostic tests that may be used to detect and stage pancreatic cancer, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is among the most promising. It is a highly sensitive test for detecting pancreatic tumors and for detecting the invasion of these tumors into the portal venous system or loco-regional lymph nodes. With the development of EUS-guided fine-needle puncture, tissue diagnosis of imaged lesions is now possible. This latest advance has improved the specificity and overall accuracy of EUS and also allows for the development of therapeutic applications, such as celiac plexus neurolysis. In this article we review the materials, methods, and clinical applications of EUS for the evaluation of pancreatic cancer.
