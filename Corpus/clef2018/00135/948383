Ultrasound diagnosis of nonobstetric disease during pregnancy. The use of ultrasound in obstetrics is well established however, its use in nonobstetric disease during pregnancy has not been emphasized. A diagnostic work-up during pregnancy is complicated by the fact that many of the usual tests require radiation to the fetus. This paper presents 3 cases in which ultrasonic scanning contributed to the diagnosis of nonobstetric disease during pregnancy. Postitive findings included enlarged edematous pancreas, gallstones, and splenomegaly. In 1 case, the finding of a normal gallbladder was helpful. When usual diagnostic procedures such as oral cholecystogram, retrograde endoscopic pancreatography, and nuclear medicine scans are perhaps contraindicated during pregnancy, the ultrasound scan is the diagnostic test of choice.
