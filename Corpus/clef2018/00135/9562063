Ultrafast MR imaging of the abdomen: echo planar imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging. Ultrafast MRI technique has become available with the introduction of new generation MR scanners for abdominal imaging. However, there is no consensus about the optimal imaging acquisition at the present time. Because single shot echo planar imaging (EPI) technique is based on high technology and had just applied in clinical imaging, further clinical investigation will be needed. Currently, the hypersensitivity to magnetic inhomogeneity and local magnetic susceptibility and the low spatial resolution may limit the widespread application of EPI technique. In addition to providing information for morphologic diagnosis, EPI will be more widely used for functional and qualitative diagnosis. Diffusion-weighted imaging can be used for differentiation of solid tumors according to their different cellular construction, evaluation of cystic lesions based on the different viscosity of their contents, and assessment of diffused pathologic changes in the parenchyma of solid organs. In addition to the previous parameters such as proton density and T1 and T2 values, diffusion factors may provide important information for the qualitative and dynamic evaluation of abdominal pathologic changes. Even though there are many difficulties that must be solved for diffusion-weighted imaging, a more wide application of this technique is expected through technologic improvement.
