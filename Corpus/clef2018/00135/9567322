Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) of the abdominal organs: imaging features. The liver, spleen, biliary tract, pancreas, and kidneys are commonly affected by opportunistic infection, malignancy, and inflammatory disorders during the course of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Clinical manifestations of solid abdominal visceral involvement are protean and usually nonspecific, but it is important to establish a specific diagnosis promptly in these often critically ill patients. This presentation reviews the cross-sectional imaging spectrum of HIV-associated lesions of these organs.
