Hemosuccus pancreaticus: a rare cause of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. We report on a patient with alcoholic chronic pancreatitis and intermittent upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Old blood was seen in the duodenum but no bleeding source could be identified by endoscopy. Computed tomography scanner and angiography disclosed an arterial pseudoaneurysm of the pancreatic tail, and left splenopancreatectomy was performed. In cases of upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage, the pancreas should be considered as a bleeding source if endoscopies remain negative and the patient presents with chronic pancreatitis.
