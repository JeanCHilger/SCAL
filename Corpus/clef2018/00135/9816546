Primary sclerosing pancreatitis and cholangitis. The clinical course of our patient suggests the association between chronic pancreatitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), as well as the usefulness of prednisolone for the treatment of this condition.Although alterations in the pancreatic duct have been reported, the association between chronic pancreatitis and PSC remains uncertain.A long-term follow-up case of chronic pancreatitis accompanied by PSC is presented. A 58-yr-old man complaining of epigastric distress was admitted to our hospital in July 1990. Endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) showed a stricture of the distal common bile duct and a narrowing of the main pancreatic duct (MPD) with mild ectasia of its branches in the head of the pancreas. ERCP taken in June 1992 revealed localized narrowings in both the right and the left main hepatic ducts, and irregularity of the MPD through the entire pancreas. An ERCP taken in June 1996 showed a progression of the narrowings of the bile ducts. The patient was diagnosed as having chronic pancreatitis accompanied by PSC. ERCP revealed a remarkable improvement of the bile ducts after 4 wk of treatment with prednisolone.
