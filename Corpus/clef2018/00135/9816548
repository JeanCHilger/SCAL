Treatment of pancreas head carcinoma in a 91-yr-old man. Report of a case successfully treated with pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy. The case of a 91-yr-old man who had a tumor of the pancreas head successfully resected is reported. He was admitted to our hospital because of obstructive jaundice, and then percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) was performed. Cholangiography via PTBD tube showed marked stenosis of the bile duct in the head of the pancreas. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) showed obstruction of the main pancreatic duct in the head of the pancreas, and carcinoma in the head of the pancreas was diagnosed. Abdominal angiography showed stenosis of the celiac trunk caused by compression from the median arcuate ligament, but no tumor stain or encasement in the pancreas was detected. Because the patient had lived an extremely healthy life and had no serious concurrent disease before admission, laparotomy was performed. The tumor in the head of the pancreas was about 2 cm in diameter and restricted inside the pancreas. Pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy (PpPD) with regional lymph node dissection was performed. The tumor was 1.5 cm in its maximal diameter, and histopathologically was diagnosed as an invasive ductal carcinoma of the pancreas with moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and now, 3 yr after surgery, he is doing very well and leading a normal daily life.
