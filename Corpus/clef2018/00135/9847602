Optimization of pulse sequences for MR cholangiopancreatography with FASE. Various types of pulse sequences for MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) have been developed in the past ten years. FASE (fast advanced spin echo) is one of the single-shot fast spin-echo sequences developed by Toshiba. By using this sequence, 2D single slice, 2D multiple slice and 3D methods can be provided. We routinely employ 2D single slice and 3D methods. The merit of 2D single slice method is conveniently obtained projection imaging within short data acquisition time. On the other hand, 3D method can yield detailed evaluation of various anatomical structures and abnormalities by using thin-slice source images. O2-inhalation study is especially recommended in case of 3D method. With the proper knowledge of sequence characteristics, MRCP using FASE can provide valuable informations of pancreatico-biliary diseases.
