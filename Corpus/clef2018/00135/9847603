Breath-hold MR cholangiopancreatography with 2D and 3D-FASE sequence at 0.5 tesla: evaluation based on measurements of signal intensity ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio. Single-slice 2D-FASE (more than 2 cm) and 3D-FASE images proved to be reliable techniques by which to create high-resolution MRCP images at 0.5 T. In particular, 3D-FASE sequence can provided MIP and its thin source images with sufficient SIR and CNR of the images, which are useful to evaluate detailed structures. Using 3D-FASE sequence, even the non-dilated pancreatobiliary system can frequently be demonstrated because each source image retains satisfactory SIR and CNR of the images due to 3D acquisition and is not affected by motion artifacts of any kind. The most important problem for 3D-FASE sequence is that view-to view amplitude modulation errors may persist, though gradient moment errors can be reduced because of no actual motion during acquisition, resulting in degraded the MIP images due to the different positions of the source images in a few patients with inconstant respiration.
