MR-cholangiopancreatography using three-dimensional Fourier transfer fast asymmetric spin-echo method (3DFT-FASE)--clinical evaluation. MR-cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a new and non-invasive method. With the three-dimensional Fourier transform fast asymmetric spin-echo (3DFT-FASE) method that allows data collection as volume and three-dimensional expression, a higher spatial resolution can be obtained in the direction of both slab thickness and in-plane. In this method, analysis by multi planar reconstruction (MPR) and observation from various angle by maximum intensity projection (MIP) are available. Although further studies are required to shorten the imaging time to stop breathing only once, to use the respiratory gating or navigator echo, clinically useful diagnosis are possible utilizing by the advantages of the 3DFT method.
