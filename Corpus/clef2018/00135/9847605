Demonstration of normal bile duct and pancreatic duct with MR cholangiopancreatography. Demonstration of normal bile duct and pancreatic duct with MR cholangiopancreatography was assessed in 78 patients including 19 cases of not impacted gallstone. Breath hold 2D-MRCP and intermittent breath hold 3D-MRCP was performed with half-Fourier fast spin echo technique using 1.5 T imager and surface coil. Diagnostic depiction rates of main pancreatic duct were 99% in the head, 97% in the body, and 91% in the tail, and of extrahepatic bile duct was 100%. Visualization of accessory pancreatic duct was 42%, but of side branch of pancreatic duct in the body to tail was poor. Anatomic variants of the biliary tree were seen in 15 cases. The reason of poor demonstration was the poor breath hold. In the majority of patients, MRCP can provide the accurate information of pancreaticobiliary tract without dilatation.
