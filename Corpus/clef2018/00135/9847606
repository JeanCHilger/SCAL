Usefulness of T2-weighted images using single shot fast spin echo (SSFSE) pulse sequence for the evaluation of pancreatobiliary diseases: comparison with MRCP using SSFSE. Single shot fast spin echo (SSFSE) pulse sequence provides us with a thick single-slice MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) as well as thin multi-slice MRCP, and T2-weighted images are also obtained with SSFSE sequences. In comparison with conventional spin-echo and fast spin-echo sequences, T2-weighted image using SSFSE sequence has the advantages of the abscence of motion artifacts and the extremely short acquisition times. MRCP using SSFSE sequence is useful in the conspicuity of bile duct, pancreatic duct, and cystic lesions. However, T2 weighted image using SSFSE is superior to MRCP not only for the differentiation between solid and cystic lesions but also for the visualization of contour of different organs and lesions.
