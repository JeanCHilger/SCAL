MR cholangiopancreatography with single-shot fast-spin-echo sequences. Imaging quality of MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) has recently made a great advance, and MRCP plays an important part in the diagnosis of pancreticobiliary diseases. To obtaining excellent-quality MRCP images, three conditions are required: fluid-to-background contrast, high spatial resolution, and suppression of respiratory motion artifacts. Respiratory motion artifacts, whose suppression is especially important for MRCP, can be controlled by the use of breath-holding, signal averaging, or respiratory triggering. These images are implemented in either single-slice technique or multi-slice technique. We have performed MRCP prior to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in more than 100 patients. MRCP images were obtained as maximum-intensity-projection (MIP) reconstruction images and thick-slice projection images by using single-shot fast-spin-echo sequence, and MIP reconstruction images by using respiratory-triggered fast-spin-echo sequence. We reviewed MRCP imaging with single-shot fast-spin-echo sequences.
