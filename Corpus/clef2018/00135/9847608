Comparative studies of breath-hold magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) between different two sequences and between 1.0T and 1.5T units. In this article, a comparative study in the diagnostic ability of a breath-hold MRCP between thin slice half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin-echo (HASTE) and thick slice rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE), and between 1.5T and 1.0T units was made. Although thin slice HASTE sequence might be more excellent in the diagnostic ability than thick slice RARE, the ability of depiction of pancreaticobiliary system on MRCP was not statistically different between these two sequences and between 1.0T and 1.5T units. Thick slice RARE sequence was inferior to thin slice HASTE in the depiction of gallbladder stone. However, thick slice RARE sequence was useful for MRCP because a projection image of pancreaticobiliary system could be easily obtained without postprocessing and without misregistration. Thick slice RARE sequence should be used in combination with thin slice HASTE sequence for the diagnosis of pancreaticobiliary system.
