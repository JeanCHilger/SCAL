Clinical efficacy of MRCP for diagnosis of patients with pancreatic neoplasm. We examined the usefulness of MRCP in pancreatic cancer compared with ERCP. Moreover, it examined in the same way in focal pancreatitis, too. We compare three findings of 1) main pancreatic duct, 2) branches of the stricture part, 3) side of tail main pancreatic duct about ERCP and MRCP. As for the branches of the stricture part, MRCP was poor compared with ERCP but as for the property of the side of the tail main pancreatic duct, MRCP excelled. The study of mass forming chronic pancreatitis was a similar result and was not the one, which excels ERCP in case of qualitative diagnosis. However, we thought that it was not invasively, suitable behind the digestive operation and digestive passage fault, in case of elapse observation and moreover that MRCP is suitable for pick up the pancreatic cancer in our clinic.
