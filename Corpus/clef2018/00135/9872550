Demonstration of microcystic disease of the pancreas by magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography: report of a case. A case of microcystic disease of the pancreas which was clearly demonstrated by magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is reported herein. Cystic dilatation of the pancreatic duct was recognized by computed tomography scanning and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Furthermore, the existence of microcystic clusters surrounding the dilated pancreatic duct were clearly visualized by MRCP. These microcystic clusters were strongly suspected preoperatively of having caused dilatation of the major pancreatic duct. Based on these findings, a distal pancreatectomy was performed. The operative specimen showed no accumulation of mucin and no evident lesions in the dilated pancreatic duct, being inconsistent with the entity of a mucus-producing tumor. Pathological examination revealed that the inner parts of microcysts constituted columnar epithelium with mucus production and papillary growth. Thus, a final histological diagnosis of intraductal papillary adenoma with idiopathic pancreatic duct ectasia was confirmed. In conclusion, MRCP, being a less aggressive diagnostic procedure than ERCP, proved extremely useful for obtaining precise information on cystic lesions of the pancreas in this patient.
