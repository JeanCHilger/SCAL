Peripelvic extravasation due to peritoneal dissemination of pancreatic carcinoma: a case report. We herein report a rare case of peripelvic extravasation due to peritoneal dissemination of pancreatic carcinoma. A 75-year-old female with left flank pain was admitted. Computed tomographic scan demonstrated a huge urinoma medial and posterior to the left kidney, and an irregular mass around the left lower ureter. Retrograde pyelography showed complete ureteral obstruction. The probable diagnosis was spontaneous peripelvic extravasation due to left ureteral tumor or ovarian tumor. Laparotomy revealed a tumor involving the body and tail of the pancreas and some disseminated tumors in the retroperitoneum. Pathological diagnosis was metastatic carcinoma of the pancreas. Malignant tumors in the digestive organs should be taken into consideration in the differential diagnosis of peripelvic extravasation.
