Intrapancreatic accessory spleen. A rare cause of a pancreatic mass. The clinical significance of intrapancreatic accessory spleens resides in the mimicry of pancreatic cancer. Radionuclide tests (Octreotide scan and Tc99m sulfur colloid scan) should be undertaken to distinguish these lesions from neuroendocrine tumors, hypervascular metastases and pancreatic carcinoma. If the tests are equivocal, diagnostic laparotomy or laparoscopy is recommended.Despite its relatively common occurrence, intrapancreatic ectopic splenic tissue is rarely detected owing to its asymptomatic nature.We report a case of a clinically asymptomatic patient in which abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans revealed a mass of 1.5 cm in diameter in the distal pancreas. The tumor markers CA 19-9 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were slightly elevated, and pancreatic neoplasm was suspected.Left pancreatic resection and splenectomy were performed. The removed specimen disclosed the presence of an accessory spleen within the pancreatic tail.
