Analysis and treatment of pancreatic cystic diseases. Owing to the spectacular progress in imaging techniques, cystic lesions of the pancreas are detected more often than previously, and this leads to therapeutic dilemmas. Of the cystic lesions of the pancreas, 80% are found to be pseudocysts and 10-15%, neoplastic cysts. The definition of a pseudocyst is: 'an accumulation of pancreatic juice surrounded by a wall of connective tissue or granulation tissue, developed as the result of acute pancreatitis, pancreatic injury or chronic pancreatitis'. In cases of asymptomatic pseudocyst, an expectative policy suffices growth and symptomatic pseudocysts justify intervention. In addition to surgical internal drainage (cystojejunostomy) there are new therapeutic techniques: external drainage guided by ultrasonography or CT, and internal drainage guided by endoscopy. Endoscopic drainage is the treatment of choice, but it requires experienced hands. The cystic tumours are subdivided into two groups: serous and mucinous cystadenomas. The group of mucinous tumours is subdivided into mucinous cystadenomas and intraductal papillary mucinous tumours. The mucinous or macrocystic adenoma is potentially malignant and should be treated as a malignancy.
