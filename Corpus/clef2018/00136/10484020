Pancreatic tuberculosis with obstructive jaundice--a case report. Isolated pancreatic tuberculosis (TB) is very rare and its treatment somewhat controversial. We report a case of pancreatic TB diagnosed as pancreatic carcinoma. An 82-yr-old man presented with right upper abdominal pain and obstructive jaundice, without fever or weight loss. Ultrasonography, computed tomography, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography showed a mass lesion in the pancreatic head, which caused stricturing of the distal common bile duct and pancreatic duct in the head of the gland. As malignancy was suspected, he underwent a Whipple procedure (pancreaticoduodenectomy). Histological examination of the resection specimen disclosed typical features of tuberculosis in the pancreatic head, lymph nodes, and at the ampulla of Vater. The rest of the abdominal cavity was unremarkable. After receiving antimicrobial therapy for tuberculosis for 6 months, he remains well, without jaundice or a recurrent mass visible by ultrasound.
