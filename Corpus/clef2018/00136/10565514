Quiz case 10. Metastasising retroduodenal gastrinoma. A 37-year-old male patient with no significant past medical history presented with a 6-month history of intermittent epigastric pain which was partially relieved by antacid medication. Gastroscopy showed a peptic ulcer and the biopsies that were taken did not show signs of malignancy. Conservative treatment was initiated, but healing was prolonged, and the epigastric pain persisted. The patient was referred to our department for further diagnosis.
