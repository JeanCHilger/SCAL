Pancreatic head tumors--preoperative examination and reality. The authors evaluated in a retrospective study the asset and accuracy of methods of preoperative diagnosis (ultrasonography, endoscopy, computed tomography and endoscopic sonography) in 47 patients with a preoperative finding of a tumour in the region of the head of the pancreas, where during the last three years a radical resection was performed. As compared with objective morphological findings of the resected tissues, endoscopic sonography proved the most sensitive and most reliable method for detection of focal changes in this area. The other compared methods also belong to the indispensible standard of preoperative diagnosis and in clear cases are sufficient for indication of surgery. Evaluation of nodal affection based on the finding of enlarged nodes during preoperative examination is very unreliable and should not influence decisions on indications for surgery.
