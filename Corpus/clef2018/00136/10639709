Solid cystic tumor of the pancreas in elderly men: report of a case. Solid cystic tumor of the pancreas is a primary pancreatic neoplasm of unknown etiology that most commonly occurs in young women and ordinarily contains hemorrhagic tissue. We report herein the unusual case of a 75-year-old man found to have a solid cystic tumor in the body and tail of the pancreas, who is the oldest such male patient to be documented in Japan. The results of laboratory data and imaging studies indicated that the patient had a nonfunctioning islet tumor or solid cystic tumor of the pancreas, and distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy was performed. The diagnosis of solid cystic tumor was confirmed based on macroscopic and histological findings of the resected pancreatic tumor. The patient is currently in good health, without any signs of tumor recurrence 1 year and 4 months after his operation. A total of 181 cases of solid cystic tumors of the pancreas reported in the Japanese literature, including our case, were reviewed to evaluate the clinical differences between patients aged 50 years or over and those younger than 50 years.
