Carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater in Crete. A clinical and ERCP registry over eight years. Carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater is an infrequent tumor that can be diagnosed, early.Twenty-four patients with histologically proven carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater were retrospectively studied and their data were analyzed.Most common presenting symptoms were jaundice (67%), weight loss (58%), fever and pain (54%). Endoscopic biopsies which were taken in 19 patients revealed carcinoma or dysplasia in 15 patients and were normal for in the rest. Twelve patients were treated with a Whipple's resection, 5 with local resection, 2 with palliative surgery and 2 received a stent endoscopically. During a mean follow-up period of 25 months, (range 1-82) 12 deaths were noted, and one patient was lost during follow-up.Presenting symptoms, endoscopic and histological findings were similar as in other series. The contribution of duodenoscopy, ERCP and endoscopic biopsy is essential for diagnosis but endoscopic biopsies may be misleading.
