The case-based Internet textbook ODITEB for multi-modal diagnosis of tumors--development, features and first experiences. Internet technologies offer the chance to build high-quality learning media for the education in medicine. In particular, the teaching of diagnostics with medical imaging can be supported by the excellent visualization and interaction capabilities. In cooperation with three radiological departments at German universities in Munich, Erlangen and Würzburg the distributed case-based Internet textbook ODITEB for tumor diagnosis of the GI-tract, liver, pancreas and thorax has been developed. It offers a growing collection of didactically prepared cases located on servers at the provider sites Munich, Erlangen and Würzburg, functionality similar to a real CT console, original DICOM data, X-rays and endoscopic and endosonographic videos, and expert-guided tours through the cases. In a first evaluation in summer 1998, 32 medical students graded the application with 1.9 ('good') on a scale from 1 ('very good') to 5 ('very bad').
