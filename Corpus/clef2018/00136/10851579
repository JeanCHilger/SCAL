PP has been misdiagnosed as a malignant pancreatic cyst neoplasm, reason why the patients are referred to specialized institutions.To describe the cases of PP treated in a 15 year-period.Review of clinical records of 14 cases treated from 1975 to 1989.There were 5 men (36%) and 9 women (64%) Mean age was 41 years (range 18 to 77). In 50% of the cases the patient had a history of severe alcoholic abuse, cholelithiasis in 28% and abdominal trauma in 15%. Five patients (35%) had AP. The period between AP symptoms and the diagnosis of PP was a mean of 5.7 months. Abdominal pain and abdominal mass were present in all of the cases, in all cases, ultrasonography and CT scan made the diagnosis of PP. Thirteen cases were treated by surgery, 12 with internal drainage, one by resection and one by external drainage. An enterocutaneous fistula (7%) was recorded in one case.
