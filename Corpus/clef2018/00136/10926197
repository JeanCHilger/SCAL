Adenosquamous carcinoma of the pancreas: report of two cases. Adenosquamous carcinoma (ASqC) of the pancreas is a rare tumor. We analyzed the radiologic findings and clinical manifestations in two such cases. In both cases (a 51-year-old woman and a 67-year-old man), the portal system was selectively and largely invaded, the superior mesenteric vein in one and the splenic vein in the other, without arterial invasion. Thus, peripancreatic vessels should be carefully observed in patients with ASqC of the pancreas. One case showed an unusual mode of spread. Only a huge metastatic lesion was initially detected, leading to the misdiagnosis of primary malignant mesenteric tumor. Such an unusual growth pattern is also worth noting.
