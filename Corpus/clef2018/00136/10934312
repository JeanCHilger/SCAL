Cardiac tamponade as the first clinical manifestation of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung. A 62-year-old woman presented in the emergency department with new onset of dyspnea and clinical signs of cardiac tamponade. She had a history of cigarette smoking and a family history of adenocarcinoma, pancreatic and breast carcinoma. An emergency two-dimensional echocardiogram confirmed the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade. Therapeutic pericardiocentesis resulted in prompt relief. Cytology confirmed malignant glandular cells, consistent with a metastatic adenocarcinoma. Computerized chest tomography confirmed pulmonary involvement.
