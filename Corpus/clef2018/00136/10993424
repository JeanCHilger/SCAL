Current surgical therapy for carcinoma of the pancreas. Despite progress in treating many solid tumors, pancreatic cancer continues to be a grave illness. Each year, >29,000 new cases of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas are diagnosed in the United States. Of these patients, only 10-20% have resectable tumors and 25,000 patients (83%) die within 12 months of diagnosis. Until recently, surgery has been the only "effective" therapy available for select patients. Historically, the operative mortality after radical pancreatic resection has been variable, ranging 1-30%, and is both operator- and institution-dependent. Even with a safe and complete surgical resection, the actual 5-year survival after surgery alone is essentially zero, although rates up to 5% have been reported. Despite what would appear to be a dismal outlook, slow progress has occurred in the operative and postoperative care of patients with pancreatic cancer. Advanced imaging techniques and laparoscopy have limited the number of unnecessary laparotomies, and novel adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy approaches have yielded promising results. This review will summarize the recent literature concerning the surgical therapy and trends in the treatment of carcinoma of the pancreas from 1990 to 1999.
