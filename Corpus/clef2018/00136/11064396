Twelve-year survival after the diagnosis of locally advanced carcinoma of the pancreas: A case report. The long-term survival rate of patients with carcinoma of the pancreas is low. Even more so, long-term survival of patients with metastatic pancreatic carcinoma is extremely rare. In this case report, we describe a patient with an unusual course of disease. This patient was diagnosed with locoregional carcinoma of the pancreas and therefore underwent gastroenterostomy and cholecystojeojenostomy without resection of the primary tumor. Later he was treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy and survived 12 years, during 11 of which he had no evidence of disease. He died 12 years after the initial diagnosis from peritoneal dissemination of poorly differentiated carcinoma complicated with obstructive jaundice and sepsis. To our knowledge, this patient had the longest reported survival with locally advanced pancreas carcinoma that was not resected. The case is presented and discussed in this article.
