Pancreatic uncinate carcinoma: sonographic findings. Pancreatic carcinoma arising from the uncinate process (pancreatic uncinate carcinoma) is relatively rare. We wished to define its clinical manifestations and sonographic findings.Clinical and sonographic data of eight cases were reviewed.The common bile duct and the pancreatic duct were not dilated until a very late stage. The lesion mimicked a mesenteric tumor in two cases. The superior mesenteric vessels were compressed anteriorly. Computed tomography was useful, not only for confirming the pancreatic uncinate origin of the lesion but also for determining precisely the mode of mesenteric vascular involvement.Knowledge of these unusual sonographic findings can determine the diagnostic strategy in pancreatic uncinate carcinoma.
