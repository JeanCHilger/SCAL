Macrocystic serous cystadenoma of the pancreas: case report. We report a case of macrocystic serous cystadenoma of the pancreas. The lesion consisted of a large main cyst and several small cysts, and each cyst showed high intensity on T1-weighted and very high intensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance images. High-intensity cyst contents may be a characteristic, if not a specific, finding of macrocystic serous cystadenoma of the pancreas.
