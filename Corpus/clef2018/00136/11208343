Neurogenic tumors of the digestive tract: report of two cases. We report two female patients with neurogenic tumors of the digestive tract. In the first patient, the tumor of 10 cm diameter originated in the stomach and at preoperative CT imitated a peripancreatic cyst. In the second patient, the tumor of 6 cm diameter originated in the duodenum. Despite large size, the tumors were clinically indolent and escaped detection at routine endoscopic evaluation. In both cases the neoplasm was removed and postoperative histopathology combined with immunohistochemistry was consistent with diagnosis of digestive Schwannoma.
