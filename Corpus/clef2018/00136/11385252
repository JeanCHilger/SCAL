Cystic tumors of the pancreas. The discovery of a cystic lesion in the pancreas implies a challenge for the physician. Approximately 10% are cystic tumors, benign to highly malignant, or true cysts, showing all stages of cellular differentiation, from benign to highly malignant tumors. Malignant cystic tumors are rare and comprise only about 1% of all pancreatic malignancies, they are potentially curable. Therefore, correct diagnosis and treatment of these lesions are of great importance. It is usually not possible to separate a pseudocyst from a benign cyst or a cystic tumor, but there are some signs and findings that could be helpful in the clinical decision. The diagnosis of a cystic pancreatic tumor requires different imaging techniques, including ultrasonography, computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, but to distinguish a pseudocyst or a benign cyst from a potentially malignant lesion can be very difficult. The usefulness of blood tests and investigations of cyst fluid can be questionable. Today, surgical treatment of cystic pancreatic tumors can be performed with low morbidity. Therefore, we conclude that an active strategy with resection of cystic tumors of the pancreas should be recommended.
