Diagnostic and interventional laparoscopy and intraoperative ultrasonography in the management of pancreatic disease. The laparoscopic management of pancreatic disorders has evolved dramatically from its inception in 1911 and its rediscovery in the 1970s. Although investigators once proclaimed that "it seems unlikely that laparoscopy will have any more than an extremely limited use in the investigation of pancreatic disorders," laparoscopy and LUS now have a well-recognized role in the staging of pancreatic cancer and an increasing part in the management of benign pancreatic disease at many institutions. Although the appropriate role of LS and LUS is debatable, the development and refinement of laparoscopic techniques and instrumentation and the improvement of noninvasive diagnostic modalities will provide new data, increase the rate of resection at laparotomy, and allow surgeons to treat a broader range of pancreatic disease by minimally invasive methods. The value of LS and LUS for benign and malignant pancreatic disorders has been clearly demonstrated, but the inevitable issues of hospital resource, operative expertise, and surgical philosophy will ultimately determine the role of laparoscopy and LUS in clinical practice.
