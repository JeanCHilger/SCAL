Imaging of benign and malignant focal liver lesions. Over the past 15 years, MR imaging of the abdomen and pelvis has progressed significantly. Although initially found to be useful as an adjunct to CT imaging for selective applications, MR imaging now is establishing a role as a primary diagnostic technique. Increasing evidence shows that MR imaging has advantages over CT regarding diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for many abnormalities of solid organs, bile and pancreatic ducts, bowel, peritoneum, and retroperitoneum. This article discusses and contrasts current MR and CT techniques for imaging the liver and discusses the relative ability to identify and diagnose focal liver disease.
