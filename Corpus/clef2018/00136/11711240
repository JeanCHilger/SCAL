Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) of intraductal papillary-mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of the pancreas: case report. The intraductal papillary-mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) is the rarest of the cystic pancreatic tumors. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is currently the gold standard for evaluating IPMN's and can demonstrate dilatation of the main duct or side branches, mural nodules, filling defects, and communication between the tumor and the main pancreatic duct. Recent literature has shown that MRCP may be more sensitive and specific in the diagnosis of IPMN In this case report, we present a patient with IPMN of the pancreas where MRCP was superior to ERCP in characterizing the tumor.
