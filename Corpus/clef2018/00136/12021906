Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) of the pancreas. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is an uncommon mass lesion composed of a variety of inflammatory and other mesenchymal cells. Although IMT was originally reported in the lung, it is now recognized that IMT can occur in a variety of organs. The occurrence of IMT in the pancreas, however, is rare. Here, we report a case of IMT arising from the head of the pancreas in a 55-year-old man. He underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy, with the diagnosis of carcinoma of the pancreas the pathological diagnosis of the tumor was IMT. By referring to previously reported cases, we conclude that, in the management of IMT in the pancreas, surgical excision is the primary choice, in order to obtain a definitive diagnosis as well as to relieve symptoms, and strict follow-up after surgery is required.
