Two cases of pancreatic tuberculosis in nonimmunocompromised patients. A diagnostic challenge and a rare cause of portal hypertension. Pancreatic tuberculosis is very rare, especially in immunocompetent patients, and represents a diagnostic challenge. We describe 2 cases of pancreatic tuberculosis mimicking carcinoma on CT scan. In the first case, explorative laparotomy revealed granulomatous inflammation suggestive of tuberculosis. Cultured smears from the pancreatic tail tested positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and the patient responded well to antituberculous medication. In the second case, fine needle aspirate revealed tuberculosis. This case is unique with regard to development of portal hypertension in pancreatic tuberculosis. Antituberculous medication achieved little improvement, then the patient was lost to follow-up. In suspicion of carcinoma the patient underwent laparotomy in another hospital. Malignancy was excluded, and a purulent necrotic pancreas was resected. The patient finally improved without any antituberculous medication and remains well. Both patients were tested HIV-negative. We summarize the etiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment of a diagnostic dilemma, which should be considered in clinical practice.
