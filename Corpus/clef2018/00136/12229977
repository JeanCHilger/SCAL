Internal hernia presenting as obstructive jaundice and acute pancreatitis. We report the first case of obstructive jaundice and acute pancreatitis caused by herniation of the small bowel through the foramen of Winslow in a 45-year-old man. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed dilated small-bowel loops positioned in the gastrohepatic space, dilatation of the gallbladder and both intrahepatic bile ducts, and mild swelling of the pancreas. A small-bowel series revealed a cluster of small-bowel loops in the mid-upper abdomen, with displacement of the stomach to the left. At laparotomy, there was an internal herniation of jejunal loop through the defect of gastrocolic ligament into the lesser sac and finally passing through the foramen of Winslow. The common bile duct was compressed externally by the herniated bowel and the pancreas was mildly swollen. To the best of our knowledge, these complications of internal hernia have not been reported previously.
