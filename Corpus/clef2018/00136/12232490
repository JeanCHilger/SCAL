Seminoma metastases mimicking primary pancreatic cancer. A case of seminoma clinical stage III, arising from the right testis and mimicking a primary pancreatic malignancy is reported.A 57-year-old male patient presented with obstructive jaundice. He suffered from recurrent abdominal pain and significant weight loss over the past 4 months. Abdominal CT scan showed a tumor in the head of the pancreas and multiple pathologically enlarged peripancreatic lymph nodes. In the laboratory findings there were signs of cholestasis and infection. A laparoscopic biopsy out of a suspicious lesion of the head of the pancreas and a surrounding lymph node was done. Histopathological examination reported metastasis of seminoma in a lymph node. Further laboratory findings showed an elevation of the human placental alkaline phosphatase (HPLAP) and urological examination revealed a suspect right testis. The patient underwent castration of the right testis and histopathological examination confirmed a seminoma. 4 cycles of chemotherapy including cisplatinum, etoposide and bleomycin led into complete response that is still ongoing.This case shows a seminoma with metastases at retroperitoneal site, mimicking a primary pancreatic neoplasm. It provides an example of the possibility of an uncommon clinical appearance of seminoma metastases and again underlines the importance of exact radiological and histopathological examination to distinguish between curable and incurable tumor.
