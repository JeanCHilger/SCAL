Duodenal bleeding revealing a renal cell carcinoma. The pancreas is an uncommon site of metastasis from renal cell carcinoma. The metastasis is generally diagnosed during the follow-up of patients who underwent nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma. In our observation, duodenal bleeding led to the diagnosis of both pancreatic metastasis and renal carcinoma. The diagnosis of pancreatic metastasis should be suspected when a pancreatic mass is associated with past or synchronous renal carcinoma. The outcome after resection of pancreatic metastasis is better than after resection of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Surgical resection of pancreatic metastasis should be considered when possible.
