Focal pancreatic hemorrhage mimicking pancreas carcinoma with lymph node metastasis. A 67-year-old man was referred to our department because of a mass in the pancreas tail. Pancreatic tail cancer with lymph node metastasis was diagnosed, based on various radiological findings. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a slightly enhanced tumor mass around the celiac plexus, and endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) showed complete obstruction of the main pancreatic duct at the tail, although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated no elevation of the mean pixel value of the tumor after gadolinium (Gd) injection, and tumor markers of pancreas cancer were within normal limits. At surgery, the mass around the celiac plexus was found to be blood coagulation, and the pancreas tail tumor was found to be a focal hematoma in the pancreas. Pathologically, the hematoma was not encapsulated, and it was diagnosed as hemorrhage in the pancreas parenchyma. Both hemorrhagic lesions were suspected to have developed respectively. It is difficult to distinguish pancreas hemorrhage from carcinoma in the pancreas with chronic pancreatitis, especially when the hemorrhage is small in size and there are other extrapancreatic hemorrhagic lesions. For such diagnosis, the superiority of MRI with Gd injection is indicated.
