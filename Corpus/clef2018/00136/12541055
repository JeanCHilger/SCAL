Benign nonepithelial fibroma in the pancreas. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of a fibroma originating in the pancreas in which preoperative imaging findings or explicit descriptions of histopathologic observations are clearly described. A 64-year-old man was referred to our hospital for further evaluation of a pancreatic mass. Clinical examination and laboratory analysis revealed no abnormal findings, except for mild elevation of serum trypsin (550 ng/ml). Abdominal ultrasonogram, computed tomographic scan, magnetic resonance imaging, and angiography demonstrated a well-demarcated circular mass in the tail of the pancreas. A laparotomy was performed on April 26, 1995. The tumor was observed to be tan-colored and smooth, and was localized in the front of the pancreas tail, suggesting that it had arisen from the pancreatic capsule. The patient underwent enucleation of the tumor. The resected tumor presented macroscopically as a fibrous nodule measuring 5.5 x 6.0 cm. The pathological diagnosis was fibroma. Immunohistochemically, spindle cells were positive for vimentin and negative for alpha-smooth muscle actin, desmin, S-100, and neuron-specific enolase.
