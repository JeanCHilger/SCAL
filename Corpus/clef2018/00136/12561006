Endoscopic ultrasonography. This review again uses a practical arrangement of the topics of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) into clinical categories rather than single diseases. The clinical categories include established indications, such as staging of gastrointestinal tract cancers, differential diagnosis of submucosal tumors, evaluation of solid and cystic pancreatic masses, detection of lymph nodes, evaluation of the biliary tree, and fine-needle aspiration (FNA). In addition to established indications, surgical and investigational techniques are presented, such as fine-needle therapeutic procedures and methods of studying portal hypertension and hepatic, abdominal, and retroperitoneal masses. This year, the new techniques and instruments presented have not included new probes or endoscopes, as these have already gained wide application in published papers and clinical practice. However, new techniques capable of facilitating the use of existing equipment are discussed, such as computer-aided EUS image analysis. Finally, some fascinating studies investigated outcomes with EUS and the cost-effectiveness of the method - stimulating both endosonographers and non-endosonographers to think about current practices and ways of improving them.
