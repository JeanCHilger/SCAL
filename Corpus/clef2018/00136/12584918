The medical imaging and radiology department. Technological developments arising from research have affected the whole wide spectrum of medical endeavor and have made a very significant impact on clinical practice and especially on imaging sciences. Ultrasonography brought spectacular advances, but CT and MRI became important landmark techniques. A further important development, which greatly increased the involvement of radiologists in direct patient management, was the growth of interventional and therapeutic techniques, called interventional radiology. Some statistics: approximately 155,000 patients per year including 19,000 CT Scans, 10,000 MRI exams, 21,000 ultrasound examinations and 1,000 therapeutic procedures. Some research activities: CT quantification of pulmonary emphysema, respiratory mechanics, MR and CT angiography, antenatal diagnosis of congenital and genetic diseases of the fetus, quantification of portal haemodynamics, MR imaging of bile and pancreatic ducts, morphologic and functional imaging of the brain, radiology of bone trauma, MR characterization in hepatic lesions.
