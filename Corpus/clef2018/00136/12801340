Solid pseudopapillary tumour of the pancreas. Solid pseudopapillary tumour of the pancreas is a rare pancreatic tumour that occurs predominantly in women, with very few cases reported in men. This is a tumour with low malignancy potential and surgical resection usually results in cure.A retrospective review of our experience with solid pseudopapillary tumours between April 1992 and December 2000 was undertaken.Six patients were identified including one male patient. The median age was 30 years, with four patients presenting with abdominal pain and discomfort and two patients presenting with palpable abdominal masses. The mean tumour diameter was 10.2 cm and the lesions were found mainly in the body and tail of the pancreas. Only one patient had tumour at the pancreatic head. One patient had a locally invasive disease and another had peritoneal spread. None of the patients received adjuvant therapy. The mean follow up was 3.8 years (range: 1.5-10.0) and all patients were free of recurrence to date.SPT is a rare tumour with an unclear origin that has a distinct histology and presentation. Although preoperative diagnosis is difficult by computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging may potentially improve this situation. In general, this is a tumour of very low malignant potential and long-term survival is excellent after resection of the tumour.
