Mucin-producing pancreatic tumor: CT findings and histopathologic correlation. Twenty patients with mucin-producing pancreatic tumor and 60 with other pancreatic diseases underwent computed tomography (CT) to establish the CT characteristics of mucin-producing pancreatic tumor. Scans were obtained with thin sections by administering a large volume of contrast material (200 mL). Mucin-producing pancreatic tumors were divided into three subgroups, and the CT characteristics were as follows: Main duct type tumors consisted of a cystic mass in or communicating with the dilated main pancreatic duct (MPD). Excrescent nodules and/or septa were found in the cyst. The MPD was markedly dilated over its entire length. Branch duct type tumors consisted of clustered small cysts that were all approximately the same size in diameter (1-2 cm). Excrescent nodules or septa were not always seen. The MPD near the lesion was often slightly dilated. Peripheral type tumors consisted of a well-defined cystic mass with excrescent nodules and/or septa. Even if the cyst was multilocular, a large main cyst was in it. The MPD usually was not dilated. The CT findings corresponded to macroscopic findings. Mucin-producing pancreatic tumor can be differentiated from other pancreatic diseases with these criteria.
