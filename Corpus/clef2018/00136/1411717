Acute pancreatitis due to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. We have reported a case of sulfonamide-induced acute pancreatitis. A review of the literature showed only eight previously reported cases. Adverse reactions to sulfonamides are well known, but acute pancreatitis is a very serious complication. If evidence of pancreatic involvement occurs during sulfonamide therapy, the medication should be discontinued immediately and, if necessary, be replaced by an alternative. Other causes of pancreatitis must be excluded.
