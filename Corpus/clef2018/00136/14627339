Esophagogastric varices due to arterioportal shunt in a serous cystadenoma of the pancreas in von Hippel-Lindau disease. Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder characterized by extensively vascularized tumors and cysts in specific organs. Angiogenesis is a striking future of VHL disease with its characteristic cysts and well-vascularized tumors. The hypervascular nature of VHL lesions has been linked to the overproduciton of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) through increased expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha). Here we describe a rare case of VHL disease with esophageal and gastric varices due to arterioportal shunt in a serous cystadenoma of the pancreas, which, upon immunohistochemical examination, exhibited HIF-1alpha and VEGF expression. Rupture of esophageal varices was successfully treated with endoscopic injection sclerotherapy.
