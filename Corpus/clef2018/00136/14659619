Rupture of a jejunal artery pseudo-aneurysm after a cephalic duodenopancreatectomy. Arterial pseudo-aneurysms complicating pancreaticoduodenectomy are rare but have a poor prognosis. They usually result from arterial erosion due to pancreatic fistula. The authors report a pseudo-aneurysm with an uncommon localization (first jejunal artery), diagnosed after a negative first arteriography, and successfully treated by radiological embolization. Special features of pseudo-aneurysms complicating pancreaticoduodenectomy are reviewed.
