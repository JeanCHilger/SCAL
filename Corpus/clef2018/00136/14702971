Pyogenic cholangitis after inadvertent submucosal contrast injection in the papilla of Vater in a patient with cholestatic hepatitis. Common bile duct stones and tumors constitute the leading cause of acute biliary tract obstruction and cholangitis. Septic complications after diagnostic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) are very unusual in unobstructed bile ducts. There are only three reported cases of patients without evidence of biliary tract disease who developed cholangitis and liver abscesses due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Biliary endoscopists believe that the inadvertent submucosal injection of contrast into the papilla of Vater is an innocent accident that has no serious consequences other than increasing the percentage of unsuccessful catheterizations of the common bile duct. Herein we describe a patient with drug-induced cholestatic hepatitis who developed pyogenic cholangitis after the inadvertent injection of submucosal contrast in the papilla of Vater.
