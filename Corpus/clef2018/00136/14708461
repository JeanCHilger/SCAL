Complications of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) is commonly used to remove bile-duct stones and to treat other problems. We prospectively investigated complications and mortality of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).Between june 6, 1998 and june 6, 1999 553 ERCP were performed in our centers. Inclusion criteria for protocol were: ERCP indication, complete follow-up and informed consent. We prospectively studied complications of ECRP in consecutive patients treated at 2 institutions (San Martin Hospital, La Plata, Argentina and Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel). The follow-up was done during 365 days with a clinical examination, laboratory test and ultrasonography to determine the possible complications.Of 553 ERCP, 43 had a complications including pancreatitis in 16 cases, cholangitis in 12, hemorrhage in 5, perforation in 3 and miscellaneous in 7. 3-1) ES frequency: 241 patients (pts). 3-2) FOLLOW-UP: 365 days in 504 pts. 3-3) Sex and age: women 274 pts, men 230 pts. Age range 1 month to 90 year old. 3-4) Final diagnoses: choledocholitiasis (38.8%), strictures (18%), pancreatic cancer (4.3%), ampullary cancer (2.3%) and normal ERCP (24.4%).The rate of complications after ES can vary in different circumstances and is primarily related to the indication for the procedure and to endoscopic technique. Our percentage of complications (7.53%) coincide with consulted studies. Today, diagnostic ERCP has been challenged by magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRC). MRC provides images of the billary and pancreatic ducts that are nearly equal to those of ERCP without the procedural risk associated.
