Positron emission tomography with 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F] fluoro- d-glucose for diagnosis of intraductal papillary mucinous tumor of the pancreas with parenchymal invasion. We used positron emission tomography with 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro- d-glucose (FDG-PET) in the diagnosis of two cases of malignant intraductal papillary mucinous tumor (IPMT) of the pancreas. A 56-year-old man and a 72-year-old man, both with tumors in the pancreatic head, were referred to Akita University Medical Center. Computed tomography revealed tumors with multiple cystic components in both patients. FDG-PET images showed markedly high FDG uptake in the area corresponding to a solid component found in one patient and diffuse faint uptake, higher than that of the surrounding tissue, in the other patient, who had no solid component. Histological examination of the resected specimens after pancreatectomy showed invasive carcinoma involving the pancreatic parenchyma in both patients. Although our experience is limited and preliminary, FDG-PET seems to be useful for the detection of malignancy in IPMT, especially in patients not showing any solid component on conventional diagnostic images such as computed tomography.
