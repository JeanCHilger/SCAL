A case of solid variant type of pancreatic serous cystadenoma mimicking islet cell tumor. We report a case of the solid variant type of pancreatic serous cystadenoma in which the very small size of the cyst on ultrasonography and computed tomography made distinguishing this tumor from other hypervascular solid tumors difficult. Recognizing the imaging features of high signal intensity on heavily T2-weighted image on MR may be helpful for correctly diagnosing the solid variant type of pancreatic serous cystadenoma.
