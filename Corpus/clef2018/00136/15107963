Pancreatic pseudoaneurysm in a child with hereditary pancreatitis: diagnosis with multidetector CT angiography. Pseudoaneurysm formation is a serious vascular complication of pancreatitis. It most commonly affects splenic and gastroduodenal arteries. We report a rare case of superior mesenteric artery pseudoaneurysm in a child with hereditary pancreatitis. Multidetector CT angiography allowed the comprehensive assessment of the aneurysm and allowed accurate surgical planning obviating the need for catheter angiography.
