Reperfusion of splanchnic artery aneurysm following transcatheter embolization: treatment with percutaneous thrombin injection. We describe a case of reperfusion of an aneurysm of the pancreaticoduodenal artery following transcatheter coil embolotherapy. The lesion was successfully treated by direct puncture of the aneurysm under computed tomographic guidance, followed by injection of thrombin. This technique is useful when an endovascular approach is not feasible.
