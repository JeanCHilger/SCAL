Usual and unusual causes of extrahepatic cholestasis: assessment with magnetic resonance cholangiography and fast MRI. Cholestasis may result from hepatocellular (intrahepatic) disease or biliary tract (extrahepatic) abnormalities. Etiologies causing extrahepatic cholestasis are extremely diverse and invasive procedures, such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC), were previously required to establish the diagnosis. Due to refinements of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques, the patient with extrahepatic cholestasis currently can be evaluated noninvasively, and the information revealed frequently exceeds the findings obtained by ERCP and PTC. In this essay, we illustrate the classic MR cholangiographic (MRC) and MRI features of a variety of disorders causing extrahepatic cholestasis, including non-neoplastic disorders of the biliary tract (congenital abnormalities, infectious processes, iatrogenic disorders, and postsurgical complications) and neoplastic conditions (e.g., tumors of the pancreas, biliary tree, liver, ampulla, and regional lymph nodes). In most cases, familiarity with the key MRC features in addition to information obtained via cross-sectional MR images provide sufficient information for adequate lesion characterization.
