Milk of calcium in a pancreatic pseudocyst. A 46-year-old man with a history of chronic alcohol use was found to have milk of calcium that had developed in a pancreatic pseudocyst. This was found incidentally on abdominal computed tomography during a workup for abnormal liver enzymes. Milk of calcium in the pancreas has been described only twice in the literature using plain abdominal radiographs and computed tomography. To our knowledge, this case report is the first to describe magnetic resonance findings of this entity.
