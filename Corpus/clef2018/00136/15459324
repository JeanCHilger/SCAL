Autoimmune pancreatitis: imaging features. To retrospectively determine imaging findings in patients with autoimmune pancreatitis.Twenty-nine patients (25 male and four female mean age, 56 yearsCT showed diffuse (n = 14) and focal (n = 7) enlargement of pancreas. Seven patients had minimal peripancreatic stranding, with lack of vascular encasement, calcification, or peripancreatic fluid collection. Nine patients had enlarged peripancreatic lymph nodes. MR imaging showed focal (n = 2) and diffuse (n = 2) enlargement with rimlike enhancement in one. MRCP revealed pancreatic duct strictures in two and sclerosing cholangitis-like appearance in one. Endoscopic US showed diffuse enlargement of pancreas with altered echotexture in 13 patients and focal mass in the head in six. ERCP showed stricture of distal common bile duct in 12 patients, irregular narrowing of intrahepatic ducts in six, diffuse irregular narrowing of pancreatic duct in nine, and focal stricture of proximal pancreatic duct in six. Serologic markers showed increased IgG and antinuclear antibody levels in seven of 12 patients. At follow-up, CT abnormalities and common bile duct strictures resolved after steroid therapy in three patients.Features that suggest autoimmune pancreatitis include focal or diffuse pancreatic enlargement, with minimal peripancreatic inflammation and absence of vascular encasement or calcification at CT and endoscopic US, and diffuse irregular narrowing of main pancreatic duct, with associated multiple biliary strictures at ERCP.
