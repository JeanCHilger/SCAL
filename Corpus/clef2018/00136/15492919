Serous microcystic adenoma of the pancreas: case report and review of the literature. Cystic tumors of the pancreas are rare neoplasms. They are more frequently identified given the improvements in imaging techniques. Serous cystadenomas are the most common among cystic neoplasms of the pancreas. In this case report we present a patient who was incidentally found to have a cystic mass in the pancreas during an abdominal imaging done for unrelated reasons and was diagnosed as serous cystadenoma of the pancreas. She was asymptomatic on admission and was operated six years later because of the progressive growth of the tumor during that period. Distal pancreatectomy was performed. Histopathologic examination of the surgery specimen confirmed the diagnosis of serous microcystic adenoma. Despite their rarity, serous cystadenomas should be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of the cystic lesions of the pancreas. Furthermore, the differentiation of serous cystadenoma from other cystic tumors as well as from non-neoplastic cysts is very important because of the great difference in their management.
