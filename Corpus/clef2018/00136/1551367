The value of fine-needle aspiration cytology in the diagnosis of inflammatory pancreatic masses. In order to determine the accuracy of fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in the diagnosis of inflammatory pancreatic masses (pseudocyst and abscess), we reviewed 91 FNAC specimens performed during 1985-1989 at the University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Medical Center. All specimens were collected under computed tomographic guidance. A sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 98% were recorded in the diagnosis of inflammatory pancreatic masses. The sensitivity and specificity of the method in the diagnosis of malignant neoplasms were 79.5% and 100%, respectively. We conclude that fine-needle aspiration cytology of pancreas is not only an important diagnostic tool in patients with pancreatic cancer, but can also be used to diagnose inflammatory masses of the pancreas. In fact, aspiration of such masses may not only be diagnostic, but also therapeutic in some patients.
