Pancreatic neoplasms. Patients who present with signs and symptoms suggesting a pancreatic neoplasm typically undergo initial imaging with transabdominal ultrasound or CT. When a pancreatic mass or fullness is identified, it may represent an inflammatory mass, benign process, or malignancy. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is performed commonly to further characterize the lesion, obtain a tissue diagnosis, and for staging. This article reviews the role of EUS for the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic tumors.
