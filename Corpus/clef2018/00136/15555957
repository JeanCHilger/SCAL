Cholangiocarcinoma and intraductal sonography. The instruments and processing systems of intraductal ultrasonography (IDUS) and 3D-IDUS are developing. IDUS is a reliable method for the evaluation of cholangiocarcinoma, and accurate staging is the most significant role of IDUS. DPR images produced by 3D-IDUS are useful to assess the tumor extension and the relationship with surrounding organs. 3D-IDUS is more useful for the precise diagnosis of cancer extension in cholangiocarcinoma, especially in invasion into the portal vein and pancreas, than CT scan and angiography. Tumor volume calculated with 3D-IDUS should determine the prognosis for the patients and facilitate the evaluation of efficacy of laser therapy.
