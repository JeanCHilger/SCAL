Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle injection. With the development of linear array echoendoscopes and the ability to perform endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided fine-needle aspiration, the delivery of therapeutic agents with fine-needle injection (FNI) emerged. EUS-guided FNI is an attractive delivery system because of its minimal invasiveness and low complication rate. This approach is effective in performing celiac plexus neurolysis for pain relief in patients with pancreatic cancer. The most exciting area of interest involves the delivery of antitumor agents in patients with locally advanced cancer, such as cancer of the pancreas or esophagus. The involvement of EUS-guided FNI in tumor therapy adds a host of potential new applications that continue to swing the pendulum of EUS from a diagnostic to a therapeutic modality.
