Blunt pancreatic trauma in children: CT diagnosis. The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of CT in the diagnosis of pancreatic injury after blunt abdominal trauma in children. Pancreatic injury was diagnosed at surgery, at autopsy, or on the basis of the development of clinical pancreatitis or a pseudocyst on follow-up imaging evaluation in 18 of 1045 consecutive children examined with CT after blunt trauma. Types of pancreatic injury included laceration in 11 children, transection in two, contusion in one, and tumor with hemorrhage in one. Three children had clinical pancreatitis without a pancreatic abnormality noted on CT. The pancreatic injury was prospectively identified on CT in 12 children (67%). The presence of fluid in the lesser sac was a useful marker for injury to the pancreas. This was noted in 13 children with pancreatic injury, whereas it was observed in only six (1%) of 1028 children in the absence of pancreatic injury (sensitivity, 72% specificity, 99%). Fluid in the anterior pararenal space was less helpful in establishing the diagnosis of pancreatic injury (sensitivity, 44%
