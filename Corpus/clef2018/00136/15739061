A rare case of isolated prostate metastasis from primary pancreatic cancer. An otherwise healthy 66 year old male presented with a suspicious intraprostatic lesion detected by digito-rectal examination. Serum PSA levels were normal. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed a nondistinctive mass within the pancreatic head. A transrectal biopsy confirmed the intraprostatic lesion as a metastatic lesion from pancreatic cancer. Therefore, we report this unusual case of a primary pancreatic carcinoma, clinical stage IV, which led to metastases in the liver and prostate.
