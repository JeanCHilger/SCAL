The diagnosis and treatment of solid-pseudopapillary tumor of pancreas. To summarize the experience of diagnosis and treatment in solid-pseudopapillary tumor of pancreas (SPT).Retrospectively analyzed 12 cases of SPT diagnosed between 2000 August and 2004 February in Peking Union Medical College Hospital.The average age of these 12 cases was 29.1, including 11 women and 1 men. The tumors of 6 cases were located in the pancreatic head, one tumor was in the neck of pancreas and 5 tumors were in the body and tail of pancreas. There were no characteristic clinical manifestations. Solid and solid-cystic masses of low echo were found in pancreas in ultrasonic examinations. CT scan found masses of low density in pancreas, while irregular enhancement appeared in the circumference of all tumors in enhanced CT scan sequences. Tumor markers in patients' serum were all negative. Pancreaticoduodenectomy were performed in 2 cases. Resection of tumors and pancreaticojejunostomy were performed in 3 cases. Simple resection of tumor was performed in 1 case. Segmental pancreatectomy and pancreaticojejunostomy was performed in one patient. Five patients underwent distal pancreatectomy and spleen resection. Ten patients were followed up with the average time of 14.3 months. No evidence of relapses and metastasis in these cases was found.Solid-pseudopapillary tumor of pancreas was one of rare pancreatic neoplasm with low malignant potential, affecting primarily young women. Complete resection resulted in long-term survival.
