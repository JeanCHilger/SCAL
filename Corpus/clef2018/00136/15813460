Laparoscopic diagnosis and treatment of organic hyperinsulinism--our first experience. Laparoscopic pancreatic procedures are still at the stage of evaluation with regard to their indications and the technical variation used. Laparoscopic pancreatic surgery is currently used for staging malignant pancreatic tumours, for the resection of benign pancreatic tumours and for the occasional management of inflammatory disorders of the pancreas. Insulinomas are rare tumours with incidence per year of 0.1-0.4 per 100,000. Ist Surgical clinic, IIIrd Internal clinic and Radiological clinic are cooperating since 1971.
