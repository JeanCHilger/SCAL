Preoperative evaluation of pancreaticobiliary tumor using MR multi-imaging techniques. To evaluate the clinical value of MR multi-imaging techniques in diagnosing and preoperative assessment of pancreaticobiliary tumor.MR multi-imaging techniques, including MR cross-sectional imaging, MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and 3D dynamic contrast-enhanced MR angiography (3D DCE MRA), were performed to make prospective diagnosis and preoperative evaluation in 28 patients with suspected pancreaticobiliary tumors. There were 17 cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, 8 cases of biliary system carcinoma and 3 cases of non-neoplastic lesions.Using MR multi-imaging techniques, the accuracy in diagnosing the patients with pancreaticobiliary tumors was 89.3% (25/28). The accuracy in detecting the range of tumor invasion was 80.3% (57/71). The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive and negative predictive value of MR multi-imaging techniques in preoperative assessment of the resectability of pancreaticobiliary tumor were 83.3%, 89.5%, 88.0%, 71.4%, and 94.4%, respectively. There was well diagnostic consistency between MR multi-imaging techniques and CT (kappa = 0.64, P<0.01). The fusion image could be made from MRCP and 3D DCE MRA images.MR multi-imaging techniques can integrate the advantages of various MR images. The non-invasive "all-in-one" MR imaging protocol is the efficient method in diagnosing, staging and preoperative assessment of pancreaticobiliary tumor.
