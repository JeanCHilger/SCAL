Recurrent cholangitis as the first manifestation of an intraductal papillary mucinous tumor of the pancreas. Intraductal papillary mucinous tumor is a rare pancreatic tumor originating from the epithelium of the pancreatic duct and exhibiting papillary proliferation of tall columnar epithelial cells. The usual clinical presentation is recurrent episodes of pancreatitis due to hypersecretion of mucin and obstruction of a markedly dilated pancreatic duct. We describe a 74-year-old man who presented recurrent attacks of cholangitis, due to a common bile duct obstruction from thick pancreatic mucus reflux, as the first manifestation of intraductal papillary mucinous tumor.
