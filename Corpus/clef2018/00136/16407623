Asymptomatic calcitonin-secreting tumor of the pancreas. A case report. Pancreatic endocrine tumors are unusual tumors arising from cells belonging generically to the amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation system.We present a case of a calcitonin-secreting pancreatic endocrine tumor in a 59-year-old male who presented at our Center with elevated calcitonin values. The patient was asymptomatic. Further investigation revealed a tumor, 80 mm in diameter, in the pancreatic body and tail along with three metastatic lesions in segments III, V, and VIII of the liver. Following a distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy and wedge resection of segments III and V along with radiofrequency ablation of the segment VIII lesion, his serum calcitonin reached normal values.Calcitonin-secreting pancreatic endocrine tumors are often malignant and have a poor prognosis. We believe that an aggressive surgical approach may improve survival.
