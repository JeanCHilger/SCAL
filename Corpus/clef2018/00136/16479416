Pancreatic ERCP. Like biliary endoscopy, pancreatic endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERCP) has evolved from being a diagnostic procedure to a therapeutic one. The advent of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and endoscopic ultrasonography have limited the need for anatomic definition and transpapillary tissue sampling, respectively. This review is therefore limited to studies published during the past year concerned either with efforts to limit the incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis or with critical reviews of therapeutic pancreatography, including the treatment of strictures, stones, and ductal disruption.
