Endosonographic diagnosis in submucosal tumours of the stomach. This study is a prospective clinical investigation that includes 158 patients (pts.), of whom 64 were diagnosed with gastric cancer by EUS in which operability was determinate, and 94 pts. with gastric submucosal tumours. Endoscopy and pathohistological examination were used in the primary detection and diagnosis of the gastric cancer, and EUS was a supplementary method that revealed additional information about the extent of the neoplasms. According to the findings of the EUS, the patients were divided into 2 groups. The first group consisted of 94 pts (59.5%) with gastric submucosal lesions, and 64 pts (40.5%) with gastric cancer respectively. The first group consisted of 94 pts. with submucosal tumours of the stomach. There were 71 pts with Leiomyoma, 11 pts with Leiomyosarcoma, 7 with an aberrant pancreas, 3 with submucosal cysts, one lipoma and one varix at fundus. The second group consisted of 64 pts (40.5%) with gastric cancer. According to the EUS findings this group was divided into two subgroups: 45 operable patients and 19 inoperable patients with gastric cancer. EUS proved a useful method for the diagnosis and follow-up of the patients with gastric cancer, as well as the staging of the tumour and follow-up during the post-operative period, and with submucosal tumours.
