Mimicks of pancreatic malignancy in patients with chronic pancreatitis: correlation of computed tomography imaging features with histopathologic findings. Differentiation of chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma can be a clinical and radiologic dilemma. Several patients with chronic pancreatitis can undergo unnecessary major abdominal surgery for benign lesions. This pictorial review illustrates the computed tomographic findings and histopathologic features of lesions mimicking pancreatic neoplasm in patients with chronic pancreatitis. Several benign lesions can simulate pancreatic malignancy in patients with chronic pancreatitis. Knowledge of the computed tomographic appearance of these benign entities is important to prevent unnecessary surgeries.
