Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of solid pancreatic masses: comparison of CT and endoscopic sonography guidance. Imaging-guided biopsies of solid pancreatic masses are performed with either CT or endoscopic sonography at our institution. We compared test characteristics of fine-needle aspiration biopsies guided using CT with those guided using endoscopic sonography and secondarily evaluated for an effect of mass size.Of 70 solid pancreatic masses, 43 (mean size, 4.4 cm range, 1.5-10.3 cm) underwent fine-needle (20- to 22-gauge) aspiration biopsy with CT guidance and 27 (mean size, 2.3 cmThe overall diagnostic rate, sensitivity, and NPV of fine-needle aspiration biopsies guided using CT (97.7%, 94.9%, and 60%, respectively) were not significantly different from those guided using endoscopic sonography (88.9%, 85%, and 57.1%, respectively). Among small masses, the diagnostic rate and sensitivity for biopsies guided using CT (100% and 100%, respectively) were not significantly different from those for biopsies guided using endoscopic sonography (90.9% and 93.8%, respectively). Among large masses, the diagnostic rate and sensitivity (96.6% and 92.3%, respectively) for biopsies guided using CT were not significantly different from those for biopsies guided using endoscopic sonography (83.3% and 50%, respectively).When biopsying solid pancreatic masses with fine needles, procedures guided with CT and those guided with endoscopic sonography have similar test characteristics regardless of mass size.
