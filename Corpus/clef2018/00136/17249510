Pancreatitis from metastatic small cell lung cancer successful treatment with endoscopic intrapancreatic stenting. Lung cancer metastases can occur in almost any organ. However, metastasis of small cell lung cancer to the pancreas is rare. Moreover, not all cases present with clinically diagnosed pancreatitis. We recently treated a patient with small cell lung carcinoma that invaded the pancreatic duct causing acute pancreatitis. Generally, the treatment for tumor-induced acute pancreatitis is initially supportive followed by aggressive chemotherapy or surgery. If the patient can tolerate the insertion of an endoscopic intrapancreatic stent, this is performed in addition to chemotherapy and surgery this approach offers a safe and effective treatment modality for such patients.
