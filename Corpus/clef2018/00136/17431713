Diffusion-weighed MR imaging of pancreatic carcinoma. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of body diffusion-weighted (DW) MR imaging in the evaluation of a pancreatic carcinoma.In nine normal volunteers and in eight patients with pancreatic carcinoma, DW images were obtained on the axial plane scanning with a multisection spin-echo-type single-shot echo planar sequence with a body coil. Moreover, we measured the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value in a circular region of interest (ROI) within the normal pancreas, pancreatic carcinoma, and tumor-associated chronic pancreatitis.On the DW images, all eight carcinomas were clearly shown as high signal intensity relative to the surrounding tissue. The ADC value (x10(-3) mm(2)/s) in the carcinoma was 1.44 +/- 0.20, which was significantly lower compared to that of normal pancreas (1.90 +/- 0.06) and tumor-associated chronic pancreatitis (2.31 +/- 0.18).Diffusion-weighted (DW) images can be helpful in detecting the pancreatic carcinoma and accessing the extent of the tumor.
