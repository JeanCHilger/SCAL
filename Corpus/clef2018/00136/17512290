Pancreatic cysts: a proposed management algorithm based on current evidence. Currently, the management strategy of pancreatic cyst (PC) remains controversial because of the inability to diagnose this type of cyst accurately and the limited knowledge of its natural history. Previously, many clinicians have advocated an aggressive resectional policy. This approach is no longer appropriate, and the number of PCs detected incidentally has increased. This study reviews the present literature and attempts to provide a management algorithm of pancreatic cysts based on currently available evidence.A Medline search was conducted to identify studies investigating PC, with particular emphasis placed on studies addressing its diagnosis and management. Additional articles were obtained from the reference lists of key articles and recent reviews.Based on current evidence, the optimal management of PC remains an art and should be individualized based on the risk-benefit ratio of surgery, which is influenced by multiple factors, such as the patient's potential life expectancy, surgical risk and malignant potential of the cyst. Our proposed management algorithm is based on an individual's predicted risk-benefit ratio of surgery. Prospective evaluation of the algorithm is needed to determine its integrity.
