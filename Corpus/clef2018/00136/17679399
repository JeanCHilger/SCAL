The role of ERCP in qualifying patients for cholecystectomy in the age of the modern biliary tract imaging. Nowadays laparoscopic cholecystectomy appear to be a golden standard of cholelithiasis treatment. Because of that possibility of manual biliary tract assessment is limited. For a long time the only way to visualise biliary and pancreatic tracts was After endosonography implementation, magnetic resonance imaging and spiral computed tomography new diagnosing possibilities appear. Although the indices to diagnostic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography were limited it is still the method of choice in treatment of choledocholithaiasis. The paper concetrates on new role of ERCP in current clinical algorithms in patients with suspected choledocholithiasis that were qualified to laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
