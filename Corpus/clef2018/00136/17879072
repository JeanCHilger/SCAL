Rare cause of recurring necrotising pancreatitis. Necrotising pancreatitis may develop as a consequence of pancreatic duct obstruction by stones, tumors or in the presence of a pancreas divisum. Alcohol and nicotine are regarded as risk factors for the disease becoming chronic.A 63-year-old female patient with suspected cystadenocarcinoma of the pancreas tail, which was resolved as a pancreatic pseudocyst, was treated for recurrent pancreatitis for 2 years. A tumor in the pancreas head was only detected on a follow-up CT after resection of a complicating liver abscess. In retrospect, progressive pancreatic duct anomalies were visible on previous scans. Partial duodenopancreatectomy confirmed the presence of a pancreas head carcinoma.Continuous critical re-evaluation of all potential causes of pancreatitis including rare conditions, such as a tumor, is required particularly if pancreatitis recurs over a long period. Re-evaluation of studies over time and of findings apart from the actual main focus of the complication, in this case pancreatitis of the pancreas tail, may help to detect the underlying disease instead of just treating the consequences.
