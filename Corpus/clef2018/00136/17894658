Endosonography- vs. endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography-based strategies in the evaluation of suspected common bile duct stones in patients with normal transabdominal imaging. Endosonography (EUS) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) are highly accurate techniques for evaluating common bile duct stones.To compare the clinical impact and costs of EUS- and ERCP-based strategies for evaluating patients with suspected common bile duct stones but normal transabdominal imaging.The costs of EUS- vs. ERCP-based strategies were compared in patients with suspected acute biliary obstruction from common bile duct stones but normal transabdominal imaging.Over a 15-month period, 110 patients were recruited. EUS detected a common bile duct lesion in 73% (common bile duct stones: 68% pancreatic cancer: 2%EUS prior to biliary interventions in patients with suspected common bile duct stones prevented unnecessary ERCP. It allowed a definitive diagnosis to be made prior to more invasive procedures.
