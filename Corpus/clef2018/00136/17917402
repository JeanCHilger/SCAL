Case of pancreatic endocrine tumor associated with Cushing's syndrome. A 78-year-old woman was admitted complaining of edema of the bilateral lower extremities and face. Computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography (US) of her abdomen revealed a pancreatic tumor and multiple liver metastases. After admission, hypokalemia and muscle weakness and edema of the bilateral lower extremities rapidly worsened. The diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome was established based on clinical and biochemical data and endocrine studies. We thought that the primary tumor was a pancreatic endocrine tumor based on the liver tumor biopsy findings, and that the pancreatic tumor and liver metastatic tumors were ectopic ACTH-producing tumors. A case of pancreatic endocrine tumor associated with Cushing's syndrome is relatively rare. We summarize previous reports.
