Endoscopic ultrasound-fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) for pancreatic lesions: effectiveness in clinical practice. Endoscopic ultrasound-fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) was shown to be a highly reliable and a very effective diagnostic technique, both based on data from clinical trials and from large clinical practice studies. EUS-FNA results are reported to be in good-to-very good agreement with the final diagnosis, and the agreement significantly exceeded the chance agreement. The overall sensitivity and specificity of EUS and of EUS-FNA are very good. EUS-FNA is an effective diagnostic technique for the evaluation of pancreatic lesions, either reported with other imaging tests or suspected on the basis of clinical and biochemical features. EUS-FNA may be performed in most cases, and the results of EUS-FNA are particularly important for their excellent positive predictive value. Nonetheless, in a few cases EUS-FNA can not be feasible, or can give false negative or inconclusiveThe main practical consequence is that before referring patients to surgeons or oncologists, EUS-FNA should be considered as the best diagnostic strategy, since tissue is still the issue' . In a prospective two-centers consecutive series from Italy, FNA did not give any false positive diagnoses of malignancy, and reduced the number of indeterminate diagnoses moreover, FNA significantly increased the specificity of diagnosis, while sensitivity was unchanged.
