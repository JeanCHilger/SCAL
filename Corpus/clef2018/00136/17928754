Clinical features of pseudoaneurysms complicating pancreatitis: single center experience and review of Korean literature. Pseudoaneurysm is a life-threatening complication of chronic or acute pancreatitis. This study was undertaken to evaluate the clinical features of pseudoaneurysm complicating pancreatitis.We reviewed the medical records of 7 patients diagnosed as pseudoaneurysms with chronic pancreatitis in Korea University Guro and Anam Hospital from January 1995 to March 2006 and analyzed their demographics, clinical courses and outcomes.All patients were men and mean age was 54.6 years (range, 43-67 years). All the cases occurred in the setting of chronic alcoholic pancreatitis complicated by pseudocyst. Abdominal pain was the unique initial clinical symptom in 5 cases, hematemesis in 1 case, and simultaneous abdominal pain with hematemesis in 1 case. Bleeding into pseudocyst developed in 5 cases, flowing into duodenum through pancreatic duct in 1 case and rupture into the descending colon in 1 case. Mean duration between onset of symptom and diagnosis of pseudoaneurysm was 7.8 days (range, 1-23 days). Six cases were diagnosed by abdominal computed tomography disclosing characteristic finding of focal high density area in the pseudocyst. Pulsed doppler abdominal sonography was performed before computed tomography in 3 cases and results were negative in 2 cases. Transcatheter arterial embolizations were initially performed in 6 cases, and there was no recurrent bleeding except one case of splenic infarction. Distal pancreatectomy was initially performed in 1 case.Pseudoaneurysms complicating chronic pancreatitis shows various clinical features. Transcatheter arterial embolization can be recommended as a primary therapeutic modality.
