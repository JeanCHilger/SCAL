Surgical management of major pancreatic injury in children. Major or complicated pancreatic trauma in children is uncommon and management strategies remain controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate our experience with both early and delayed surgery in these pediatric cases.We carried out a retrospective analysis of data of pediatric patients with major or complicated pancreatic injury operated on between January 1994 and December 2005 in our pediatric trauma center.Thirteen children (9 boys and 4 girls) with a mean age of 8.5 years (range 3 - 16 years) were operated for major or complicated pancreatic injury. The extent of injury was: grade II (major contusion without duct injury or tissue loss) in 4 children grade III (distal transection) in 5 children and grade IV injury (proximal transection) in four patients. Pseudocyst developed in 8 children: 4 with grade II injury, 2 with grade III injury and 2 with grade IV injury (one with abdominal pseudocyst and one with an abdominal and a mediastinal pseudocyst). Early diagnosis and operation was achieved in 5 cases, while delayed diagnosis and operation occurred in 8. Three children underwent cystogastrostomyOur results support the view that early operation is important in ductal pancreatic injury. We recommend transferring children with a suspected ductal injury to a tertiary center with experience in both pediatric ERCP and pancreatic surgery.
