Solid-cystic pseudopapillary tumor of pancreas: description of two cases and literature review. The authors report the cases of two young female patients aged 17 and 27 years who underwent surgery for a rare tumor of the pancreas, Frantz's tumor or solid-cystic pseudopapillary tumor. Solid-cystic pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas is a rare tumor, accounting for 2.7% of pancreatic exocrine tumors. About 90% of these tumors occur in young women and they can reach very large dimensions. Due to their rareness and behavior, they are often associated with diagnostic and therapeutic problems. In most cases surgical treatment is curative and neither chemotherapy nor radiotherapy should be added. In the few cases where surgery is not possible, radiotherapy can be used because these tumors appear to be radiosensitive.
