Pancreatic cystic neuroendocrine tumors: preoperative diagnosis with endoscopic ultrasound and fine-needle immunocytology. Pancreatic cystic neuroendocrine tumors (CNETs) are rare premalignant conditions. Computed tomography (CT) occasionally demonstrates the hypervascular border characteristic of NETs. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) with fine-needle aspiration and immunocytology may be a more consistent means to establish the diagnosis, but no data on the role of EUS are available. This report represents the largest series of CNETs treated to date, documents the role of EUS in preoperative diagnosis, and describes current management.Retrospective review of our experience with CNETs treated at an academic center between 1999 and 2006.Thirteen patients with CNETs were identified. One had symptoms consistent with a functional tumor the others were nonfunctional. Twelve were detected by CTEUS-guided immunocytology with staining for neuroendocrine markers is an accurate method to establish the diagnosis of CNET preoperatively. Short- and long-term outcomes after resection are excellent.
