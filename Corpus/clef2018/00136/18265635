Diagnostic value of MRCP and indications for ERCP. To assess the diagnostic value of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and examine the indications for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).MRCP was performed in 185 patients with hepatobiliary disease in whom abdominal ultrasonography (US) had not been of diagnostic value. These patients were selected for MRCP in view of their abdominal symptoms, high levels of hepatobiliary enzymes, and pancreatic/bile duct dilatation found by abdominal US. Based on MRCP findings, 75 patients were selected for ERCP.ERCP provided new findings in 14 (18.%) patients. In 110 patients subjected to only MRCP and follow-up as well as in 75 patients with MRCP followed by ERCP, MRCP-based diagnosis corresponded with the final diagnosis. In our study, patients who would have conventionally required ERCP, such as those with natural passed choledocholithiasis and postoperative bile duct dilatation, could be followed up without ERCP. These results the importance of considering indications for ERCP.MRCP can be an alternative to ERCP at least for diagnosis.
