Magnetic resonance imaging findings of the pancreas in patients with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome and mutations in the SBDS gene. Pancreatic MRI was evaluated in 14 patients with a clinical diagnosis of Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, and the findings were correlated with Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond gene (SBDS) genotype. The findings suggest that patients with mutations in the SBDS gene have a characteristic magnetic resonance imaging pattern of fat-replaced pancreas and that SBDS mutations are unlikely in patients without this pattern.
