Ectopic pancreas presenting as ampulla of Vater tumor. Ectopic pancreas is relatively rare and is defined as pancreatic tissue that is situated abnormally, has no contact with the normal pancreas, and has its own ductal system and blood supply. It is usually an incidental finding in clinical practice. Most patients with an ectopic pancreas are asymptomatic, and, if present, symptoms are nonspecific and depend on the site of the lesion and the different complications encountered. Heterotopic pancreatic tissue has been found in several abdominal and intrathoracic locations, most frequently in the stomach (25%-60%) or the duodenum (25%-35%). Herein, we report a patient presenting with symptoms of ampullary tumor with obstructive jaundice, but the imaging study did not suggest the possibility of ectopic pancreas preoperatively.
