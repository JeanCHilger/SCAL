Growth process of small pancreatic carcinoma: a case report with imaging observation for 22 months. This report describes serial observations of the growth process of a small invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) of the pancreas from imaging studies. Histopathological studies showed IDC with macroscopic retention cysts proximal to an intraductal papillary-mucinous adenoma with mild atypia of the branch duct type in the pancreatic body, with no relation between the two lesions. IDC was demonstrated as an extremely low-echoic mass resembling a cyst with an unclear margin on the initial endoscopic ultrasonography. We misinterpreted the low-echoic mass as a benign intraductal mucinous-papillary neoplasm (IPMN) based on findings of other imaging studies, and the patient was followed-up. The mass increased from 7 mm to 13 mm in diameter over 22 mo, and remained smaller than 10 mm in diameter for about 420 d. The tumor volume doubling time was 252 d. The Ki67 labeling index was 15.9%, similar to that described in previous reports. Hence, IDC may grow slowly while remaining small.
