Video-laparoscopic excision of pancreatic insulinoma. Experience with 3 cases. Laparoscopic treatment of lesions of the distal pancreas has gained favour worldwide in the last decade. The objective of this study was to analyze 3 cases of insulinoma successfully treated with the laparoscopic approach. From 2000 to 2007 in our institution 3 patients with insulinoma of the left pancreas were treated with a laparoscopic approach. The insulinoma was diagnosed by helical CT scan, Two cases were treated by left pancreatectomy and one by enucleation. The resections were achieved by laparoscopy with no conversion to laparotomy. There were no intraoperative complications. Average blood loss was 180 mi (range: 150-350). Mean operative time was 232 minutes (range: 225-240). Morbidity consisted in one mild pancreatic fistula after left pancreatectomy that was healed by conservative treatment after 24 days. The mean hospital stay was 13 days (range: 10-20). During the follow-up insulinoma symptoms have disappeared in all patients. This study confirms the feasibility of laparoscopic resection for insulinoma. Operative times were quite acceptable and the conversion rate was nil. Times to oral intake and walking were shorter than after open surgery, as was the mean postoperative hospital stay.
