Diagnosis of solid pancreatic masses by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) with fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is increasingly being used in the staging algorithm for pancreatic carcinoma. This allows for a tissue diagnosis, which was previously difficult to obtain. The aim of this study is to assess the utility of EUS-FNA in establishing the diagnosis of solid pancreatic mass lesions in an Australian population.A retrospective review of the EUS databases of St Vincent's Hospital Melbourne and Western Hospital, Melbourne from November 2002 to May 2006 was undertaken. The focus was on patients with a solid pancreatic mass who underwent EUS-FNA. Surgical pathology or long-term follow up was used to identify false-positive or false-negative results.EUS was undertaken to investigate a solid pancreatic or distal common bile duct mass lesion in 155 patients. Seventy-two of these underwent EUS-guided FNA. Mean age was 68 years. A positive tissue diagnosis of malignancy could be made in 55 (76%). Nine (13%) had benign histology, with 8 (11%) having inadequate tissue obtained from FNA. A later tissue diagnosis of carcinoma was made in eight of those with either benign or inadequate histology, although in all cases there were EUS features diagnostic of malignancy, with FNA limited by technical difficulties. The overall utility of EUS-FNA showed a sensitivity of 87%, specificity 100%, positive predictive value 100%, negative predictive value 52% and overall accuracy 89%.EUS-FNA gives a high return for histological diagnosis of solid pancreatic mass lesions and should be part of the standard management algorithm for pancreatic carcinoma.
