A case of primary paraganglioma that arose in the pancreas: the Color Doppler ultrasonography and dynamic CT features. Paragangliomas rarely originate from the pancreas and they are characterized on imaging studies as well-marginated, hypervascular masses with cystic areas. We herein report on a case report of pancreatic paraganglioma in a 57-year-old woman, which was confirmed on pathology. Color Doppler ultrasonography and dynamic CT demonstrated a well-demarcated, extremely hypervascular mass with prominent intratumoral vessels and early contrast filling of the draining veins from the mass. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography showed that the main pancreatic duct was displaced and mildly dilated.
