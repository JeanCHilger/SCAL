Solid pseudopapillary carcinoma of the pancreas: differentiation from benign solid pseudopapillary tumour using CT and MRI. To describe the computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings that differentiate solid pseudopapillary carcinomas (SPC) from benign solid pseudopapillary tumours (SPT) of the pancreas.Preoperative CT or MRI images for 26 patients (eight patients with SPC and 18 patients with SPT) were retrospectively reviewed. In addition to the general morphological features, the presence of pancreatic duct dilation, vascular invasion, and extrapancreatic metastases were comparatively assessed.There were no significant differences between pancreatic SPC and benign SPT with respect to tumour size, location, capsule thickness, internal composition, and pattern of calcification, nor was there any correlation with the age and gender of the patients. Pancreatic duct dilation was present in four of the eight (50%) SPC patients, and was absent in all benign SPT patients (p=0.005). Vascular encasement by the tumour (n=2) and hepatic metastases (n=2) were also exclusively demonstrated in SPC patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that pancreatic duct dilation (p=0.001), vessel encasement (p=0.027), and metastasis (p=0.027) were the variables that can be used to differentiate SPC from benign SPT.SPC of the pancreas may help to differentiate from benign SPT using the imaging features of aggressive behaviour of pancreatic duct dilation and vessel encasement with or without extrapancreatic metastases.
