Ultrasound diagnosis of bile ducts after cholecystectomy. The paper is concerned with the results of multiprojectional ultrasound investigation of the biliferous system in 68 patients at varying time after cholecystectomy. In most cases (77.9%) signs of dilated biliary ducts were undetectable. Dilatation of the hepaticodoch was most frequently determined by choledolithiasis, stricture or stenosing papillitis, rarely--by pancreatic head cancer. Investigation of the biliary ducts in patients after cholecystectomy should be started with ultrasound tomography endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or iv cholangiography and dynamic cholescintigraphy were indicated after the detection of the signs of dilated ducts (the anteroposterior diameter of the common hepatic duct was over 6 mm).
