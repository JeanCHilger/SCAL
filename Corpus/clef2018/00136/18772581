A case of groove pancreatitis (segmental form) presented with obstructive jaundice associated with pancreatobiliary maljunction. A 52-year-old-man was admitted to our hospital for obstructive jaundice. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangio drainage (PTCD) and endscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) were performed, and pointed out stenosis of lower common bile duct (CBD) and pancreatobiliary maljunction. Brushing cytology of this lesion was negative for malignancy. CT and MRI revealed chronic inflammatory change in groove lesion with no mass formation suggesting tumor. So we diagnosed groove pancreatitis (segmental form) associated with pancreatobiliary maljunction, and operation (resection of the bile duct and biliary reconstruction by Roux-en-Y) was done. Resected specimen was revealed stenosis of the bile duct formed by fibrous tissue with no malignancy compatible to groove pancreatitis pathologically. This is first reported case of groove pancreatits associated with pancreatobiliary maljunction.
