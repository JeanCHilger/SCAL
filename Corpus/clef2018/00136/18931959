A case of solid pseudopapillary tumour of the pancreas and malignant mesothelioma. A 59-year-old man with previous exposure to asbestos presented with dyspnoea and pleuritic chest pain, had a pleural effusion and was treated for pneumonia. His symptom recurred and was found to have an abdominal mass.An abdominal computerised tomogram revealed pancreatic body mass arising. Pleural fluid cytology and a pleural biopsy failed to demonstrate malignancy. The pancreatic tumour was resected by distal pancreatectomy, segmental colectomy and splenectomy. The tumour was a solid pseudopapillary pancreatic tumour (SPT) with a high metastatic potential. The patient deteriorated and a repeat biopsy of the thickened pleura confirmed malignancy which was initially thought to be metastases from the SPT. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed malignant mesothelioma. The patient developed liver metastases and died 2 years from the diagnosis of metastatic disease.
