Differentiated therapy for intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) of the pancreas are of increasing interest in the field of pancreatic surgery ever since their first description as an individual pancreatic tumor entity in 1982. The decision for surgical or conservative management is based on the adenoma-carcinoma sequence and the differentiation into main-duct or branch-duct IPMN. Invasive IPMN forms (carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinoma) and in particular noninvasive IPMNs (adenoma and borderline tumors) reveal significantly better survival rates than ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.
