Osteoclastic and pleomorphic giant cell tumors of the pancreas diagnosed via EUS-guided FNA: unique clinical, endoscopic, and pathologic findings in a series of 5 patients. Osteoclastic and pleomorphic giant cell tumors of the pancreas are rare entities that have been typically described only in single case reports. We report on our experience with a series of 5 patients with pancreatic giant cell tumors seen at our institution.This was a retrospective study involving a search of the study institution's medical records from 2001 to 2007 for patients diagnosed with giant cell-containing neoplasms of the pancreas.Five patients (2 women, 3 men) were identified. Age range was 59 to 81 years, with a mean of 70.2 years. None were current or former smokers. None had a history of alcohol abuse or preexisting pancreatitis of any kind. On EUS, tumors tended to be large, with a mean diameter of 47 mm (range 20-70 mm). All tumors had a heterogeneous echotexture and a distinct appearance when compared with the typical appearance of adenocarcinoma when viewed via EUS. The diagnosis of giant cell tumor of the pancreas, as well as the subtype, was made via EUS-guided FNA of the pancreatic lesion. Patients with pleomorphic giant cell tumors of the pancreas had a poor clinical course with a rapid decline, whereas those with mixed or osteoclastic giant cell tumors tended to have a better outcome, with a greater long-term survival. One patient is still alive more than 18 months after diagnosis.Retrospective study.Giant cell tumors of the pancreas have unique clinical, endoscopic, and cytologic features. The risk factors for these lesions may be different from those associated with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Some giant cell tumor subtypes may carry a more favorable prognosis than pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and awareness and recognition of these differences can affect patient care.
