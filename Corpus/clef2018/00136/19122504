Endoscopic papillectomy. Although few controlled trials exist in the field, endoscopic papillectomy has evolved over the recent years with new data on preoperative staging and improved methods for its safe and successful completion. In 2006, a consensus guideline was published by the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy evaluating the role of endoscopy in managing ampullary adenomas.The recent literature of endoscopic papillectomy has focused on the preoperative management of ampullary tumors, with a paper evaluating the role of endoscopic ultrasound. Also, a randomized controlled trial has shown that the use of pancreatic duct stents is associated with less incidence of postendoscopic papillectomy pancreatitis, although the study was probably underpowered. Several methods can be used to help locate the pancreatic duct postendoscopic papillectomy (endoscopic ultrasound-guided rendezvous and methylene blue injection). The recurrence and complication rate in more recent papers continue to be acceptable, at about 30 and 20%, respectively.Endoscopic papillectomy is a reasonable alternative to transduodenal surgical excision, but more controlled studies with long-term data are needed to evaluate preoperative staging accuracy and recurrence rates.
