Two successful curative operations using stomach-preserving distal pancreatectomy with celiac axis resection for the treatment of locally advanced pancreatic body cancer. Large vessel invasion is a serious factor determining whether an operation for pancreatic body cancer is feasible. The Appleby operation is a radical operation for the treatment of pancreatic body cancer that has infiltrated the celiac axis. Since this procedure includes a total gastrectomy, the operation is associated with a high morbidity, mortality, and deteriorating postoperative quality of life (QOL). We experienced two cases in which radical operations consisting of a stomach-preserving distal pancreatectomy with en bloc resection of the celiac, common hepatic, and left gastric artery were performed. The use of adjuvant chemotherapy in these cases led to a good postoperative QOL.
