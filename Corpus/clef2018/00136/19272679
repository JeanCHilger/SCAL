The solid pseudopapillary tumor of pancreas: two cases and literature review. Solid pseudopapillary tumor (SPT) of the pancreas is a rare exocrine pancreatic tumor behaving in a low-grade fashion, with limited local invasion risk and a rare metastatic evolution. We report SPT in two young females, revealed by abdominal pain and an epigastric mass. The diagnosis of a cystic tumor was based on abdominal ultrasound and CT data in the first case and on MRI in the second. A distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy were successfully performed in the first case and a central pancreatectomy in the second. Histological study confirmed the diagnosis of SPT of the pancreas.
