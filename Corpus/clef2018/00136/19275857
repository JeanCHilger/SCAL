Laparoscopic management of a retroperitoneal duodenal perforation following ERCP for periampullary cancer. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is a fairly common procedure being performed in several centers worldwide. Although it is proven to be efficient and relatively safe, complications do occur (1.8%). We present a patient with ERCP-induced retroperitoneal perforation of the duodenum treated laparoscopically at our institution.The patient is a 60-year-old female who underwent ERCP for obstructive jaundice due to periampullary carcinoma, during which the perforation occurred. Laparoscopy was performed 5 hours later and the perforation sutured primarily.The operating time was 125 minutes. On the fourth postoperative day, the patient developed a retroperitoneal collection, confirmed by computed tomographic scan. Re-look laparoscopy was performed and the fluid drained. She recovered completely and was discharged on the eighth postoperative day.Duodenal perforation following ERCP is rare, with an incidence of 1.8%. Both surgical and non-surgical management have been reported, each with its specific indications. Our patient needed surgery, because the perforation was large and a retroperitoneal collection was present. Laparotomy is the preferred approach, though now laparoscopy is a viable and effective alternative, because it provides the benefits of minimal access, such as reduced pain and early ambulation.
