Pancreatoblastoma in an adult patient. A case report. Preoperative diagnosis of a pancreatoblastoma in adults is challenging because of its rarity. Furthermore, difficulties increase since pancreatoblastomas share radiological findings similar to those found in other masses of the pancreas.A 36-year-old woman was studied with ultrasonography and CT for a mass of the pancreatic head causing obstructive jaundice. Diagnosis of pancreatoblastoma was obtained with histology and immunohistochemistry of the resected specimen.We reviewed the radiological findings of pancreatoblastomas and possible radiological criteria of differentiation from other pancreatic tumors. A pancreatoblastoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a pancreatic mass presenting atypical radiological features.
