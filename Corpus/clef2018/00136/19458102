Utility of the FIESTA pulse sequence in body oncologic imaging: review. The FIESTA (fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition) ultrafast pulse sequence provides high-resolution images with outstanding image contrast and high signal-to-noise ratio relative to the single-shot fast spin-echo (SSFSE) sequence. The purpose of this article is to illustrate the utility of the FIESTA sequence in oncologic imaging.Although the FIESTA technique cannot replace standard imaging techniques, it can be used as an excellent adjunct to conventional T1-and T2-weighted sequences for abdominal imaging and for screening the entire abdomen and pelvis at the beginning of the examination. In addition, the motion-insensitive FIESTA sequence is useful in surgical planning, particularly in patients with retroperitoneal tumors and pancreatic cancer because it offers excellent visualization of the vascular anatomy.
