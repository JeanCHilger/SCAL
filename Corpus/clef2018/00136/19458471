Pancreatic tuberculosis presenting with pancreatic cystic tumor: a case report and review of the literature. Pancreatic tuberculosis is a rare clinical entity, presenting as malignancy mimicking pancreatic mass. Therefore, it represents a diagnostic challenge. To date, ten cases have been reported in Korea. I report an additional case and review all Korean reports about pancreatic tuberculosis. A 57-year-old woman presented with abdominal pain. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a 2.2x1.2 cm cystic mass in pancreatic body. She was followed for nine months, at which time a cystic mass was enlarged to 3.3x2.2 cm in size on the CT. An exploratory laparotomy was performed for the accurate diagnosis and to rule out the possibility of malignant change. Pathological examination of the resected specimen revealed chronic granulomatous inflammation with caseous necrosis and multinucleated giant cells, which was compatible with tuberculosis. Among the 11 cases of pancreatic tuberculosis, five cases were combined with pulmonary tuberculosis. The pancreatic tuberculosis frequently presented with multicystic pancreatic mass (81%) and the most common anatomic locations were the head (73%), tail (18%), and body (9%). Three cases were diagnosed by using US or EUS guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB), and all cases were medically cured without exploratory laparotomy. In summary, pancreatic tuberculosis, despite its rarity, should be considered for differential diagnosis of pancreatic cystic mass in endemic countries. Clinical suspicion and accurate diagnostic approach including FNAB of pancreatic tuberculosis are needed to avoid performing unnecessary laparotomy.
