Hemoductal pancreatitis secondary to gastroduodenal artery-ruptured pseudoaneurysm: a rare cause of hematemesis. A 65-yr-old alcoholic man with a history of calcific pancreatitis presented with massive hematemesis complicated by lipothymia. Physical examination disclosed stigmata of chronic liver disease. The laboratory picture was predominantly of cholestatic type with impaired liver protein synthetic activity. Emergency esophagogastroduodenoscopy was unable to provide definitive diagnosis, but reendoscopy with a side-viewing duodenoscope revealed active bleeding through the ampulla of Vater. An ultrasound examination showed a large, complex pancreatic lesion that computed tomography showed to be a pancreatic pseudocyst with an inside pseudoaneurysm. A visceral angiography revealed an anomalous arising of the common hepatic artery from the superior mesenteric artery and a pseudoaneurysm of the gastroduodenal artery at its origin. A second massive hemorrhage required an emergency operation, and surgical liver biopsy revealed focal steatosis. In conclusion, bleeding of a pancreatic pseudoaneurysm may be massive but intermittent, and side-viewing duodenoscopy, even prolonged, is essential in the diagnosis.
