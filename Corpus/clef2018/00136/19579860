Primary pancreatic lymphoma. AIMS AND BACKGROUNDS: Primary pancreatic lymphoma is non-Hodgkin lymphoma primarily involving the pancreas, which is rare in pancreatic diseases. The aim of this work is to summarize the diagnostic and therapeutic experience of primary pancreatic lymphoma.We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of 7 cases of primary pancreatic lymphoma admitted to Huashan Hospital in the past 3 years. Available English literature was also reviewed using the following terms: primary pancreatic lymphoma and pancreatic lymphoma.The literature review identified 157 additional cases, and a total of 164 cases had been analyzed. In this series, only 30% had a successful non-operative diagnosis. The curative rate of the surgery-adjuvant chemotherapy group was higher than that of the chemotherapy alone group.Obtaining specimens through surgery is an effective diagnostic tool. Surgical resection in combination with postoperative chemotherapy plays a therapeutic role.
