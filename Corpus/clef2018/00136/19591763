Abdominal manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus: spectrum of imaging findings. Systemic lupus erythematosus is an immune-mediated syndrome in which the immune response is to non-organ-specific antigens, and virtually every organ in the abdominal cavity may become involved. Only renal involvement forms part of the diagnostic criteria, however, a combination of typically nonspecific findings, including peritoneal surface, enteric, renal, renal tract, pancreatic, adrenal, hepatobiliary, and splenic manifestations, should be looked for in patients with known lupus or other connective tissue disease who are undergoing abdominal imaging and may suggest the diagnosis in patients presenting with an acute abdomen. Our work presents the spectrum of imaging findings of abdominal manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus.
