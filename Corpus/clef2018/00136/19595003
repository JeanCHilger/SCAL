Diagnosis and surgical treatment for non-functional islet cell tumor: a retrospective analysis of 44 cases. To evaluate the methods of diagnosis and surgical treatment for nonfunctional islet cell tumor (NICT).Forty-four patients with non-functional islet cell tumor treated at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University during January 1968 to June 2008 were analyzed retrospectively. There were 9 males and 35 females, aged from 7- to 70-years-old. Clinical manifestation: 15 cases (34.1%) of abdominal masses, 17 patients (38.6%) with epigastric or back pain, 5 cases of jaundice, 5 cases (11.4%) for upper abdominal fullness or vomiting, 10 cases (22.7%) of pancreatic tumor noticed by routine health checkups or imaging examinations. Imaging examination: CT scan, sonography, ERCP, MRI, upper GI series were performed in 33 (75.0%), 16 (36.4%), 6 (13.6%), 2 (4.5%), and 10 cases (22.7%) respectively. Operation methods: 39 patients (88.6%) underwent surgical resection and the other 5 patients did not.pancreatic fistula in 7 patients (15.9%), intra-abdominal bleeding in 4 (9.1%), gastrojejunal anastomosis outlet obstruction in 1 (2.3%), biliary fistula in 2 (4.5%) and incisional infection in 3 (6.8%). Surgery related mortality happened in 2 patients (4.5%), both treated before 1999. Twenty-five patients underwent operation between January 1999 and June 2008 were followed up for 6 to 108 months. All survive except one died 75 months after the surgery for unknown reason.No specific clinical manifestation is recognized for non-functional islet cell tumor. Spiral CT is an optimal diagnostic method, while surgery is the first choice for treatment. Middle segmental pancreatectomy has become an alternative surgical protocol for NICT.
