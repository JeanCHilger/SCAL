Endoscopic ultrasound in the evaluation of pancreaticobiliary disorders. The close proximity of the endoscopic ultrasound probe to the pancreas coupled with the ability to perform fine needle aspiration has made endoscopic ultrasound an extremely important technique for the evaluation of both benign and malignant pancreaticobiliary disorders. In parallel to the widespread importance of diagnostic endoscopic ultrasound, the therapeutic and interventional applications of this procedure are expanding and may become a major breakthrough in the management of pancreaticobiliary diseases. This article focuses on the utility and recent advances of endoscopic ultrasound in the diagnostic evaluation pancreaticobiliary disorders and analyses the data of well established interventional procedures such as celiac plexus neurolysis and pseudocyst drainage. Moreover, the more innovative procedures, such endoscopic ultrasound-guided biliary and pancreatic ducts access and drainage and the experimental use of direct endoscopic ultrasound-guided therapy of both solid and cystic pancreatic lesions will also be reviewed.
