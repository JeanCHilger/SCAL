Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1--presenting with impotence. A 35-year old man presented with a 4-year history of impotence. His past history was significant for hypercalcaemia, bilateral pyelolithotomies for renal calculi and parathyroidectomy for hyperparathyroidism. He had an episode of haemetemesis and malaena a year before being seen here. Endocrine investigations revealed hyperprolactinemia, hypergastrinemia and increased basal acid output. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was indicative of a pituitary microadenoma. Computed tomographic scan of the abdomen revealed a bulky pancreas which was suggestive of a gastrin-secreting islet cell tumour. This case illustrates an unusual presentation of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1) with impotence and hyperprolactinemia. A short review of the literature was done.
