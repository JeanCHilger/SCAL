Multiple endocrine adenomatosis type I in pregnancy. A 26-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 0, having episodes of confusion, slurred speech, and blurred vision in pregnancy was documented to have severe hypoglycemia with elevated serum insulin and C-peptide levels. Emergency treatment for hypoglycemia was necessary several times during pregnancy. A healthy female infant was delivered after oxytocin induction of labor. Post partum the patient had numerous episodes of severe hypoglycemia in spite of constant intravenous glucose. Computerized tomographic scan of the pancreas failed to show a lesion, whereas pancreatic arteriography revealed a 2 cm mass in the tail of the pancreas. Partial pancreatectomy was performed 6 days after delivery. Microscopic examination of the tissue confirmed the presence of an insulinoma. Hypercalcemia developed together with elevated parathyroid hormone levels. The presence of an insulinoma, hypercalcemia, and a history of hyperparathyroidism in two relatives indicates that this is a case of multiple endocrine adenomatosis type I first diagnosed during pregnancy.
