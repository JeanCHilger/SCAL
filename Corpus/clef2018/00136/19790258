Sonographic appearance of focal fatty infiltration of the pancreas. We report the sonographic, CT, and MRI findings in a case of focal fatty infiltration of the pancreas. Sonography revealed an echogenic mass in pancreas head. On CT, the mass was hypodense. The mass showed same signal intensity to the surrounding normal pancreas on in-phase T1-weighted MR images and a loss of signal intensity on opposed-phase MR images.
