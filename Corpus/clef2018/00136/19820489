Clinical feasibility of Açai (Euterpe olerácea) pulp as an oral contrast agent for magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. We evaluate the effectiveness of the Amazonian fruit pulp from Euterpe olerácea (popularly named Açaí) as a negative oral contrast agent applied to clinical routine. The use of such contrasts is particularly important in magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) to reduce overlapping.We administered Açaí pulp to 5 nonsymptomatic subjects and 35 patients submitted to unspecific abdominal MR imaging, intending to set up optimal protocol. In 8 MRCP examinations, contrast and image effects were assessed and graded blindly by 2 independent radiologists. Quantitative analysis was performed by Wilcoxon test as to verify the potential of the Açaí to eliminate overlap signal over the pancreaticobiliary tract. Adverse effects and subject tolerance were also addressed.The Açaí pulp elicited a local brightness decrease in T2-weighted images. The depiction of gallbladder, common bile duct, ampulla of Vater, and pancreatic duct was markedly improved after Açaí ingestion because of the suppression of the overlapping from bowel loops and gastric content (P < 0.01). All patients considered Açaí palatable, and no side effect was registered.The Açaí pulp can be used routinely in MRCP studies as a natural, safe, and inexpensive negative oral contrast agent with high efficacy and patient acceptance.
