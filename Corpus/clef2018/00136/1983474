Preoperative localization in organic hyperinsulinism--useful or superfluous. In our own patient material (n = 43) the percutane sonography had a sensitivity of 61.9%, the CT 73.3%, the angiography 66.6% and the PTP 76.9%. Intraoperatively 95.2% of all insulinomas were palpable and the intraoperative sonography (IOS) had a sensitivity of 81.2%. In Germany all clinics except for one recommended a sonography and a CT and 83.8% an angiography prior to the first operation. A preoperative localization diagnostic is therefore not absolutely necessary, but may however be helpful in single cases.
