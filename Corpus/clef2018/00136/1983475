Diagnosis and therapy of hyperinsulinism. The diagnosis of hyperinsulinism in our 47 patients could be confirmed by clinical signs, blood sugar, insulin and C-peptide estimation. The preoperative localisation of the insulinoma was reached by angiography in 60%, by CT in 50% and by sonography in 10%. Intraoperative tumor localisation by measurement of incorporated P32 was effective in 70%. In 37 patients we enucleated one or more adenomas. In 5 children with Nesidioblastosis the left sided pancreas resection was performed. 5 patients with islet cell carcinoma were treated by duodenopancreatectomy and Streptozotocin. The longest survival time was 6 years.
