Epidemiology of pancreatic cancer in Norway: trends in incidence, basis of diagnosis and survival 1965-2007. Pancreatic cancer is the second most frequent gastrointestinal cancer in the Western world. Few reports on concomitant trends in pancreatic cancer incidence, diagnosis, mortality and survival exist at the national level. This study provides a baseline overview of the temporal patterns in these four indicators over the past four decades in Norway.We analysed trends in incidence, basis of diagnosis, relative survival and mortality from the Cancer Registry of Norway for the period 1965-2007.Included were 21,663 patients with pancreatic cancers. Incidence and mortality rates remained at around 6-8 per 100,000 over the study period. Diagnoses based on clinical examination alone dropped from 12.5% (in the 1950s) to <1% (in the 2000s), while use of imaging techniques, such as CT and MRI, increased from 3.6% to >30%. Previously high rates of autopsy-verified diagnosis and non-therapeutic surgery decreased accordingly. Consistently more primary tumours (from 12.9% to 19.4%) and metastases (from 12.5% to 22.4%) had histological examination, and use of endoscopy increased to approximately 10%. Relative survival after diagnosis of pancreatic cancer remains very low. However, in recent years, a modest improvement in short-term survival has been noted, with 1-year survival rates of 18% and 16% for males and females, respectively.The incidence and mortality for pancreatic cancer remain largely unchanged, with few 5-year survivors. Improved short-term survival may reflect more aggressive use of surgery and chemotherapy. Further elucidation of risk factors in pancreatic cancer is needed to enable effective prevention, early detection and improved treatment strategies.
