Multiple pancreatic insulinomas: multislice CT. Imaging techniques are in permanent evolution and so are their respective sensitivities. We present a case of a patient who had three abdominal CT scans over 10 years for the detection of pancreatic insulinomas. The first was made on an incremental CT and showed no lesion, the second on a single-slice helical CT which revealed a single centimetric tumor of the head of the pancreas, and the third on 64-slice CT which revealed 5 infracentimetric tumors. We do not know if all were present at the first scan but it is possible that these small tumors could have been missed on thick CT scan slices with overlap. The ideal imaging technique for the detection of endocrine pancreatic tumor is not known yet. The detection rates in the latest publications are 80% for CT scans and 70% for MRI, but there is a slight preference for CT scan because of its larger availability and higher resolution.
