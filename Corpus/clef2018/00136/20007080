CA19-9 antigen levels can distinguish between benign and malignant pancreaticobiliary disease. CA19-9 is a carbohydrate tumor-associated antigen which is frequently upregulated in pancreatobiliary neoplasia. However, it may also be elevated in patients with jaundice in the absence of a tumor due to biliary obstruction, and in other non-hepato-pancreatico-biliary conditions. This study aimed to evaluate whether CA19-9 levels could accurately differentiate between benign and malignant pancreatobiliary disease.All patients referred to a single surgeon for investigation of pancreaticobiliary disease in 2003 in whom a firm diagnosis had been established were included. For malignant disease, a histological diagnosis was required but for benign disease a firm radiological diagnosis was deemed adequate. The patients were divided into 4 categories: pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PCa) cholangiocarcinoma (CCa)Final diagnoses were made of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PCa, n=73), cholangiocarcinoma (CCa, n=19), ampullary carcinoma (Amp, n=7), neuroendocrine carcinoma (Neu, n=4), duodenal carcinoma (Duo, n=3), chronic pancreatitis (CP, n=115), and biliary calculous disease (Calc, n=27). Median CA19-9 levels (U/ml) were: PCa, 653 CCa, 408CA19-9 is useful in the differentiation of pancreatobiliary disease and when using an optimized cut-off and combining with routine radiology, the diagnostic yield is improved significantly, thus stressing the importance of a multi-disciplinary approach to pancreatobiliary disease.
