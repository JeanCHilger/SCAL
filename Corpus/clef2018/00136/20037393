A case of super advanced gastric cancer responding to S-1+CDDP and S-1 single regimen which led to a clinical complete response. A patient is a 62-year-old man who was presented by epigastralgia. He was pointed out super advanced gastric cancer with paraaortic lymph node metastasis and pancreatic invasion by gastrointestinal endoscopy (GIS) and computed tomography (CT). We diagnosed as cT4N3M0, and started with chemotherapy as follows. S-1 (120 mg/day) was orally administered for 3 weeks followed by 2-week rest as one course, and CDDP (90 mg/body)was administered by intravenous drip on day 8. Partial response was indicated after 6 courses of this procedure. We changed the procedure to S-1 single treatment for 2 weeks followed by 2-week rest. After 12-course of this procedure, he was attacked by brain infarction, the procedure was interrupted for about 8 months. After rehabilitation, an S-1 single treatment was restarted. The main tumor and metastatic lymph node appeared no change before the interruption of S-1 single treatment. So, we considered that complete response was continued. S-1+CDDP and S-1 single regimen appears to be effective for super advanced gastric cancer.
