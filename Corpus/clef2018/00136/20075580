Perplexing epigastric pain-coincident myocardial infarction and acute pancreatitis. Acute myocardial infarction (MI) complicated with acute pancreatitis has been rarely reported. A 68-year-old man presented to our department 15 hours after development of epigastric pain. In addition to his symptoms, the elevated serum pancreatic enzymes and the image study on abdominal computerized tomography all led to the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. Elevated cardiac biomarkers and a standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrating ST-segment elevation in 5 of the 6 precordial leads suggested an attack of MI. Oral intake was resumed after medical management for his acute pancreatitis and acute MI. Coronary angiogram on day 11 revealed total occlusion of the middle segment of the left anterior-descending coronary artery. Subsequently, angioplasty with stenting was done. The patient was discharged without significant complications. It is critical to make a rapid but detailed differential diagnosis of abdominal pain. Even though acute pancreatitis-associated ECG abnormalities have been reported previously, any ECG abnormalities in a patient presenting abdominal pain should be evaluated and treated cautiously. Thorough clinical evidence, including history, physical findings, ECG, image studies and serum biomarkers, are informative in seeking and analyzing possible etiologies.
