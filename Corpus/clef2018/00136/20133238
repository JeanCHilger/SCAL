Synchronous gastric adenocarcinoma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The association between gastric and pancreatic carcinoma is a relatively rare condition. In gastric carcinoma patients, the prevalence of second tumors varies 2.8% to 6.8% according to the reported statistics. Gastric cancer associated with pancreatic cancer is uncommon.We report a case of a 73-year-old patient hospitalized for vomiting and weight loss. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy demonstrated an ulcerative lesion of the gastric antrum. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance showed a gastric thickening in the antral and pyloric portion and a nodular mass (3 X 1.7 cm) in the uncinate portion of the pancreas.The patient underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy according to Whipple regional type I Fortner. Histological examination of the specimen demonstrated a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the stomach and a poorly differentiated ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.Long survival is rare in patients with associated gastric and pancreatic cancer. Surgical resection remains the only potentially curative treatment.
