Insulinoma of the pancreas: analysis of a clinical series of 30 cases. Insulinoma is the most frequent neuroendocrine pancreatic tumor and is the main cause for hypoglicemia due to endogenous hyperinsulinism. We performed an analysis of a clinical series in order to study the clinical and biological spectrum of presentation, the preoperatory imagistic diagnosis and results of the surgical approach. Between 1986-2009, 30 patients with symptoms suggesting an insulinoma were hospitalized in our department. Preoperatory localization of insulinomas was possible in 16 patients. The most sensitive imagistic methods were ecoendoscopy and magnetic resonance. Intraoperatory ultrasound was performed in 16 patients and its sensitivity in detection of insulinomas was 93% the combination between intraoperative ultrasound and manual exploration of pancreas by the surgeon reached a 100% sensitivity. Before the intraoperatory ultrasound was used the tumor excision was predominantly done by extensive pancreatic resection, while after this was available in our centre more conservative (enucleo-resection) procedures were chosen. In 1 patient the resection was done by laparoscopy, and in 1 patient by robotic surgery. The dimensions of the tumor were less than 2 cm in most of the patientsDue to small dimensions, the preoperative diagnosis of insulinomas is usually difficult, ecoendoscopy being the most sensitive method. Intraoperative ultrasound is essential for insulinoma localization and for chosing the optimal type of excision. Enucleation is the resection method to be chosen whenever this it is technical possible. In benign insulinomas the prognosis is excellent, surgical resection being curative in all cases.
