Pancreatic cholangiocarcinoma as an ST-elevation myocardial infarction with thrombolytic therapy. We report the case of a 46-year-old patient who presented a chest pain with ST-segment elevation in precordial leads V1 (2 mm), V2 (4 mm), and V3 (3 mm). Thrombolytic therapy was initiated with the combination tenecteplase tissue plasminogene activator, aspirin, and heparin. Further electrocardiogram and cardiac enzymes measured every 2 hours during the first 24 hours remained normal, and after a computed tomography of the abdomen, the patient was taken to surgery for an exploratory abdominal operation that revealed pancreatic cholangiocarcinoma. No adverse effects were attributed to the initial thrombolytic therapy. Finally, myocardial ischemia was excluded because the electrocardiogram, cardiac enzymes, and a 1-month later cardiac stress test remained normal and because no coronary event occurred during the first year after surgery. Our case shows that it is sometimes difficult to make the share, in prehospital field, between coronary syndrome and other pathology, particularly digestive pathology. However, in the appropriate chest pain patient with presumed acute myocardial infarction, ST-segment elevation remains the primary criterion for the initiation of thrombolytic therapy, primary angioplasty, and/or other pharmacologic interventions.
