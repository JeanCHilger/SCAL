A case of metastatic pancreatic cancer with a remarkable response to combination therapy of gemcitabine and adoptive immune cell therapy. A 52-year-old woman with a chief complaint of epigastric distress was diagnosed as having pancreatic cancer with multiple liver metastases. After insertion of a metallic stent for biliary stenosis, combination therapy of gemcitabine (GEM) and adoptive immune cell therapy (AICT) was initiated. GEM 1,000 mg/m2 was administered on day 1, 8 and 15 every 4 weeks, while AICT using MUC1 peptide-pulsed dendritic cells (DC) and anti-CD3-activated T lymphocytes (CAT) was given biweekly. After 6 courses of GEM and 9 courses of DC-CAT, the patient was considered to have a complete response (CR) on CT and MRI examination. CR has still been maintained by the continuous administration of GEM and CAT. The combination therapy of GEM and AICT was suggested to be effective against advanced pancreatic cancer.
