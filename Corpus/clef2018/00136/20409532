Littoral cell angioma in main and accessory intrapancreatic spleen presenting as splenic rupture. We report the incidental finding of a nodular mass in the pancreatic tail on a contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan preinterventional to emergency laparotomy for splenic rupture. Because of the past surgical history and radiologic appearance, differential diagnosis included atypical lymphoma in the spleen and regional lymph node, pancreatic adenocarcinoma with splenic metastasis, and intrapancreatic metastase of malignant melanoma the patient underwent both splenectomy and pancreatic tail resection. A diagnosis of littoral cell angioma in main and accessory intrapancreatic spleen was made. To our knowledge, this is the first description of littoral cell angioma of the spleen involving both main and accessory organ presenting as splenic rupture.
