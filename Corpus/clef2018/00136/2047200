The evaluation of thin slice incremental CE-CT for diagnosis of extension of pancreatic carcinoma--comparison of CT and pathological findings. Thin slice table incremental CE-CT was performed on 11 patients with pancreatic carcinoma in the resectable state as determined by surgery and pathological findings. CT findings were correlated mainly with pathological findings, or correlated with surgical findings if pathological findings were not obtained. (For example, when pancreatomy was performed distal to bile duct and duodenum, CT findings were correlated with surgical findings). All findings were described in accordance with General Rules for Cancer of the Pancreas proposed by Japan Pancreas Society, and we assessed the value of thin slice table incremental CE-CT in evaluation of the extension of pancreatic carcinoma. Thin slice table incremental CE-CT was effective in the diagnosis of serosal invasion, retroperitoneal infiltration, duodenal invasion, bile duct invasion, and arterial invasion with diagnostic accuracy of 91%, 100%, 91%, 100%, and 97%, respectively. On the other hand, the accuracy for portal venous invasion, neural plexus invasion, and lymph node metastasis was low with diagnostic rate of 79%, 63%, and 71%, respectively. It was concluded that thin slice table incremental CE-CT was effective in evaluation of the extension of pancreatic carcinoma.
