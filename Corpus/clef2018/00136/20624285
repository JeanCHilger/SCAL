Granulocytic sarcoma of the pancreas: a case report and review of the literatures. Granulocytic sarcoma (GS) is a form of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), also known as extramedullary myeloid tumor or chloroma. It forms a solid malignant tumor consisting of myelocytes or granulocytes and is typically located in bone while occurrence in other parts of the body is rare.We reported a 40-year-old male patient who had jaundice, highly elevated bilirubin, and a mass highly suspicious of pancreatic head carcinoma. We performed surgery and the pathology and immunohistochemistry suggested GS however the blood test and the bone marrow infiltration showed no evidence of AML. In our review of the published reports of GS, we only found six reports of the GS in the pancreas, and we suggested that immunohistochemical staining should be used to accurately differentiate GS from other pancreatic cancer and other types of leukemia.The accurate diagnosis of GS is necessary for determining prognosis and deciding appropriate therapy.
