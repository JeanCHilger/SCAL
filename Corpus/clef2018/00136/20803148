Pancreatic trauma in children. To document the demographics, mechanisms and outcome of traumatic pancreatitis in children at a single large tertiary referral centre in Australia.We undertook a 10-year retrospective audit of children admitted to the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia with a hospital coded diagnosis which included pancreatic injury between 1993 and 2002. Data included patient demographics, source of admission, mechanism of injury, pancreatic complications, associated injuries, intensive care unit admission, results of any operative findings, results of any acute computed tomography and/or ultrasound imaging of pancreas, selected laboratory findings and length of stay.We identified two distinct groups of patients in the 91 documented cases of pancreatic trauma (median age 8.0 years, range 0.6-15.8 years M:F 2.5:1.0): 59 had a history of abdominal trauma and elevated serum lipase but no CT or ultrasound evidence of pancreatic injury (Group A)Significant pancreatic injury can occur in the absence of abnormality on medical imaging. Pancreatic trauma commonly occurs in the context of multiple injuries after motor vehicle accidents in children and bicycle handlebar injuries, especially in boys. Most children can be treated conservatively, with surgical intervention being limited to high-grade ductal injury.
