Management of branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas: observation with MR imaging. To evaluate the clinical outcomes of conservative management by observation with MRI of patients with branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (BD-IPMNs).Twenty-three consecutive patients, who were followed up by MRI with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) over a period of more than 9 months after initial MRI examinations, were enrolled in this study. On MRI, number of lesions, the maximum diameter of BD-IPMNs, lesion location, the presence of associated dilatation of main pancreatic duct (MPD), the presence of enhancing mural nodules within the lesion and the presence of interval change were retrospectively reviewed on initial and follow-up MR images in consensus by two radiologists. All patients were evaluated to search for evidence of malignant progression of disease.The follow-up period ranged from 10 to 96 months (mean, 37 months). On initial MRI with MRCP, a total of 39 lesions were found in 23 patients. The maximum diameter of BD-IPMNs ranged between 6 and 32 mm, with a mean of 12 mm. Thirty-four lesions (87%) of 19 patients remained unchanged in the maximum diameter. Five lesions (13%) of four patients showed an increase in the maximum diameter. Enhancing mural nodules were not found in any individual, neither on the initial MRI study nor on the follow-up studies. There was no patient who had evidence of local aggressive growth of tumor or evidence of metastases to distant sites.Our study suggests that branch-duct IPMNs without enhancing mural nodules are essentially benign and should be managed nonoperatively through observation by MRI.
