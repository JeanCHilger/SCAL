Adenomatoid tumour of the adrenal gland: a case report and literature review. Adenomatoid tumour (AT) is a rare, benign neoplasm of mesothelial origin, which usually occurs in the genital tract of both sexes. Occasionally these tumours are found in extra genital locations such as heart, pancreas, skin, pleura, omentum, lymph nodes, retroperitoneum, intestinal mesentery and adrenal gland. Histologically ATs show a mixture of solid and cystic patterns usually with focal presence of signet-ring like cells and scattered lymphoid infiltration. The most important thing about these tumours is not to mis-diagnose them as primary malignant or metastatic neoplasms. We present a case of an adrenal AT in a 29-year-old asymptomatic male. The tumour was an incidental finding during abdominal CT-scan for an unrelated condition. We also present a review of the literature concerning adrenal gland AT and give possible differential diagnosis.
