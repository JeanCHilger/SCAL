Direct intracystic biopsy and pancreatic cystoscopy through a 19-gauge needle EUS (with videos). Histologic diagnosis of cystic pancreatic lesions (CPLs) is often difficult because of the low sensitivity of FNA and brush cytology.To discover whether obtaining biopsy samples from the cystic wall could increase the diagnostic yield of these lesions.A pilot study including 2 patients with CPLs.Endoscopy unit in a tertiary-care hospital.Two women with CPLs located at the pancreatic head.On EUS, biopsy forceps and a SpyGlass fiberoptic were passed through a 19-gauge needle to visualize and obtain samples from the cystic wall.The histologic assessment was based on the obtained biopsy samples.Both CPLs were considered to be mucinous cystoadenomas, because mucinous-like cylindric epithelium without cellular atypia was observed.Pilot study.Obtaining biopsy samples from the wall of a CPL is now feasible. It represents a significant advantage in the diagnostic yield of this type of lesion.
