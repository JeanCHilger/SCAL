CT of the extrahepatic bile ducts: wall thickness and contrast enhancement in normal and abnormal ducts. Recent reports have described thickening and enhancement of the extrahepatic bile duct wall on CT scans obtained after administration of IV contrast material. We undertook this study to establish parameters for the normal thickness and enhancement of the bile duct wall on CT, and to develop a differential diagnosis for thickening of the duct wall. Routine CT examinations of 100 patients without biliary disease were evaluated prospectively. The common hepatic duct and common bile duct could be visualized in 66% and 82% of cases, respectively the walls of these ducts could be separately discerned in 59% and 52%. The mean thickness of the duct wall was 1 mm, with a maximal thickness of 1.5 mm. Wall enhancement was similar to (51%), slightly greater than (44%), or markedly greater than (5%) the enhancement of adjacent pancreatic parenchyma. A review of records covering a 5-year period identified 52 patients in whom CT showed thickening of the bile duct wall (greater than or equal to 2 mm). These patients could be categorized by seven underlying diseases, and analysis of the CT scans revealed four general patterns of thickening. Focal, concentric wall thickening in the distal common bile duct was associated with pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, and common bile duct stones
