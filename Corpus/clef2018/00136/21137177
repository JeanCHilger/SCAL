Our experience with endoscopic drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts. The authors first provide and overview of the main knowledge on pancreatic pseudocysts. They discuss the individual types of pancreatic pseudocysts, their clinical picture, complications and diagnosis. As part of the differential diagnosis, they emphasise the need to distinguish pancreatic pseudocysts from cystic tumours and benign cysts. Special attention is then paid to various modalities of treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts.The authors present their own results of endoscopic drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts, one of the key options in the treatment of this condition.A total of 33 patients (24 men and 9 women) were treated by endoscopic drainage between September 2007 and March 2009. Endoscopic drainage was performed transduodenally in 4 patients and via the transgastric route in 29 patients 6 times with endosonographic device and with duodenoscope after endosonographic alignment in 27 patients.The authors conclude that endoscopic drainage is an effective method of treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts.
