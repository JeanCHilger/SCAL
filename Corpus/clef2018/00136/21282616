Magnetosome-like ferrimagnetic iron oxide nanocubes for highly sensitive MRI of single cells and transplanted pancreatic islets. For ultrasensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic nanoparticles with extremely high r2 relaxivity are strongly desired. Magnetosome-like nanoparticles were prepared by coating polyethylene glycol-phospholipid (PEG-phospholipid) onto ferrimagnetic iron oxide nanocubes (FIONs). FIONs exhibited a very high relaxivity (r2) of 324 mM(-1) s(-1), allowing efficient labeling of various kinds of cells. The magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of single cells labeled with FIONs is demonstrated not only in vitro but also in vivo. Pancreatic islet grafts and their rejection could be imaged using FIONs on a 1.5 T clinical MRI scanner. The strong contrast effect of FIONs enabled MR imaging of transplanted islets in small rodents as well as in large animals. Therefore, we expect that MR imaging of pancreatic islet grafts using FIONs has the potentials for clinical applications. Furthermore, FIONs will enable highly sensitive noninvasive assessment after cell transplantation.
