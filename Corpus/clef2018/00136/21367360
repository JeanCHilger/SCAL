Diffuse splenic infarction in a case of severe acute pancreatitis. Splenic infarction is rare in inflammatory diseases of the pancreas, although the spleen and its vessels have an intimate relation with the pancreas. Most reported cases are of focal infarction, and treatment is mostly conservative. The authors report a case of diffuse splenic infarction in a 17-year-old boy with severe acute pancreatitis who presented with massive upper gastrointestinal bleeding and was treated with splenectomy.
